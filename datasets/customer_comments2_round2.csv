There's a pool at the rooftop, plenty of seating, and a water tower that you can visit! Drinks however were pricey and came in plastic cups, I expected better presentation."

The whole room wreaked of sewage and all they did was move me to another room. Even before this flooding incident, the room was disgusting and full of hair and grime. I'd recommend staying literally anywhere else."
3,a-hVnSTC12MY5L3t9yOSJw,3/16/2022,4 star rating,Great vibes and service at this hotel. They have a restaurant and lots of seating for the public. I tried the mocktails from their menu and they were so refreshing.
4,a-hVnSTC12MY5L3t9yOSJw,8/30/2022,5 star rating,This spot has the most gorgeous view of the NYC skyline! Perfect spot for a first date or girls night out! Friendly staff and sip on a cocktail by the poolside and enjoy the view!

It was SO GORGEOUS! I have never been to a place like this. The pool, the drinks the music and the views. UNBEATABLE."

7,a-hVnSTC12MY5L3t9yOSJw,2/26/2023,2 star rating,"I agree with most of the other reviewers. If you're looking for a relaxing stay- try someplace else. This is a party hotel. -super loud inside and out. Street noise, constant honking in the middle of the night. People staying next door to my room we're blasting music all night long. Impossible to sleep/relax. -shower is poorly designed; water gets everywhere outside the shower. Soaks the floor. -food is average. Had a few good meals. The Caesar salad had no flavor. Gnocchi was great. Pizza was good too. -service was non-existent. never saw anyone that worked there other than for room service. The lobby is on a different level than the entrance and there isn't anyone to greet you or help you out unless you go to another floor. -hotel is faux luxury. Looks nice at first glance but if you look closely, the paint is chipping, elevators are dirty, and things are starting to fall apart. Lastly- you can tell they don't care about customer service because if you read any negative reviews on yelp, the hotel manager is playing defense and arguing people's honest opinions. Never a good sign."

9,a-hVnSTC12MY5L3t9yOSJw,9/14/2021,2 star rating,"I came here for my birthday with a dinner party of 7. The hotel is outstandingly beautiful. But the manager is not the greatest guy around. We were sitting outside and we seen the biggest rat run across our table and practically brushed our feet. We were all very traumatized. The managers response was ""it was outside right"". Nothing was compensated at that moment. When my party moved themselves inside the hostess that night didn't even apologize for our inconvenience but just said ""you can sit here"". If it wasn't for the beautiful ambiance that night the place wouldn't gotten 1 star. The food was regular. My favorite was the truffle fries and the guacamole and chips for appetizer. The salmon tasted regular and they need to add more food to their dishes for such an expensive menu."
10,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,3/8/2022,4 star rating,"I am loving the vibe here! Think.... tiki bar with a disco ball. Cool x10. I want to bring friends here, dates here, there really is no bad occasion. They have booths, high tops, I've been here a few times on weeknights for after work drink and weekends for after brunch drinks and it's usually never without some crowd. I'd make a reservation if you are looking to get a table, otherwise I believe you can just hang out at the bar no problem. I've only ever had the drinks here but they've always been a hit! I got the Pineapple express with mezcal here on my last visit and plan to get it for the rest of my visits forever... it was so great. I switched it up with a spicy marg for the next round but I just missed my pineapple express. They have a section of their drink menu where they give you all the ingredients, you just pop in what kind of alcohol you'd like. Loved that! You can stick to the same liquor all night and still mix up your cocktail choices. I will come here again and probably again after that. A very cool spot in the west village for sure."
11,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,4/28/2022,5 star rating,"Came here on Thursday night for drinks with friends. It was packed! (As can probably be expected for a nice WV bar on a Thursday).My favorite part of their menu is they have some base ""mixes"" and you pick your liquor. I got the mule kick with mezcal which was a good combo and my friends got the Pineapple Express with tequila.Great vibes and would return!"
12,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,10/19/2022,5 star rating,Always a classic spot to visit with friends. Great for small groups but be sure to make a reservation so they can accommodate! I've also walked in before and put my name down and the table is always ready before the time they give you. Also the pitcher drinks are great to share
13,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,1/25/2023,1 star rating,Beware!! They will charge you if you cancel. That policy was never mentioned on the website or the Resy booking. Booked a reservation and canceled ahead of the reservation due to sitter issues

15,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,1/16/2023,5 star rating,This is one of the best burgers in New York. The new general manager Tim is absolutely excellent and really takes care of everyone. I will be back again and again. Highly suggest this place to anybody. The burger is absolutely incredible. I would definitely order it with the bacon and fries. The loaded tater tots are also amazing. Thank you Tim for giving us a great night.

17,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,12/2/2021,5 star rating,"Nate and I popped in to The Happiest Hour for a quick drink with a friend before dinner at Olio e Piu nearby. It was already pretty hopping at around 6:45 pm on a Thursday, but we were seated right away by the windows in front. I got a vodka/cucumber/lime drink (Maid to Order) that was super refreshing and balanced. We only got one round of drinks, but the food smelled great and their burger deal was something I'd come back for. The music they were playing was awesome, a great playlist of covers, beachy tunes, and good jams without being kitschy and annoying.The best part is that when the bill came out, it included a sweet postcard and an awesome, retro-looking pen. I asked our server if I could buy one of the pens and they just gave me three of them. I love a little souvenir keepsake like that! The postcard shows the city skyline in the background of a beach with palm trees, in keeping with the beachy vibes of this place.I loved this spot and would definitely go back for another cocktail and a burger."
18,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,3/30/2021,2 star rating,"I had heard great things about the burger here but was very underwhelmed. I ordered the burger ($15) with fries ($4) and the boneless chicken wings ($12).First off, we placed an order for pickup and preordered about 30 minutes later, and it was ice cold when we got it. I'm convinced they made it the second it came through.Despite being cold, the fries were good and a solid portion for the price paid. The burger was phenomenal but was about 3x as much as it should be. Like, it tasted like shake shack. I would have liked it a lot had I paid $7 for it, but for $15....hard pass.The Buffalo boneless chicken wings were horrendous. You know the chicken you get from the Chinese restaurants that are rated like 1 star on Yelp? Imagine that in the worse Buffalo sauce you've ever had dipped in watered down ranch and you've got it. Waste of $12.All in all, I'm a hard pass on the food. Save your money and go to shake shack."
19,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,8/28/2022,5 star rating,"This spot is great for drinks and food. Loved the overall vibe of the bar and staff, cozy but spacious inside. There were 2 hostess, super friendly and accomodating. My server Hanna was funny and flexible. The friendliness of the staff we met, really made it a lovely experience. Tried the burger, oh yeah, coming back for another. Perfect for a chill drink solo or with a friend. Also downstairs another floor, perhaps for private party"
20,9dqJrTzx0GvBNb-J0VyeGg,4/16/2021,1 star rating,"Maybe this restaurant should learn some manners or hire a more polite staff because I will never order from here ever again. I had a special request for my order and they contacted me because they were unable to fulfill it which is OK, their loss not mine. I just asked Can the order be canceled then??? And didn't even receive an answer was just abruptly hung up on. Such a shame. I don't expect much from customer service out here but that was just too rude for me not to address. So kiss my a** paphos diner, I'll take my business elsewhere."
21,9dqJrTzx0GvBNb-J0VyeGg,1/9/2020,3 star rating,"The food and service has been pretty consistent (good). However, the prices are becoming outrageous. On my last visit our bill was $43 for two patty-melts with sweet potato fries, two waters,  two coffees, and a shake. They've started charging $0.50 for honey (despite the fact the tea is already $3) and have downgraded the ketchup to some off brand from Heinz. My fiance will probably still continue to patronize because of the relationships he's built there and fact that his job is next door but we can't justify spending this sort of money here on a regular basis. Makes me kinda sad but we're def on the hunt for a new place."

I have been coming here for years, never disappointed."

Possible 2 to 3 days old.Chicken salad was gross- mayo/white cream substance was just not edible.I honestly felt they just didn't want to fulfill my grubhub order so they pulled something from the back of the fridge. I basically ate someone else's leftovers.

It's a great deal- you get a salad, an appetizer with pita bread, and entree for about $16. The chicken kabob was moist and flavorful; my only disappointment was that we did not have grilled tomatoes, in its place we got grilled veggies. That said, it was still good. I also got a tea at the end and it was delicious! The staff were attentive, friendly, helpful, and accommodating. This is a spot worth exploring."

65,qrncvjkiKN5Z-JC06ygy6A,8/12/2022,3 star rating,"Was expecting a lot more. Got the Chicken Barg dinner as takeout, came as pictured with a sliver of roasted tomato, a mini whole wheat pita, ranch, and a small garden salad side. Food was fresh, but it was cold by the time it got to me. Also, was not happy to see that my dish was served with 1/4 of a tomato... is this supposed to be an attempt at an aesthetic garnish? This isn't traditional Persian hospitality, where you can usually expect a skewer or at least a few full pieces of onions and tomatoes and peppers along side the kabob and rice. Usually it's also customary to have a plate of herbs and radish served with a side of bread and butter as a complimentary start to the meal. Not sure how I feel about this place overall...wasn't bad but wasn't to die for. Ultimately indifferent toward it. Good in a pinch, and probably more worth it for the lunch/early dinner special."
66,qrncvjkiKN5Z-JC06ygy6A,3/11/2022,2 star rating,Not good quality. We order a kashk bademjoon and it is literally done this else which was also very greasy. And bad behavior of the server.

They have a great lunch special that is also eligible for pickup. Our chicken kebab was delicious with basmati rice, pita bread, hummus and salad. The portion was hefty and it kept well in the fridge. They have a small, clean restaurant and there have been people seated inside both times I have come. Of note, they have an NYU discount so be sure to bring your badge."

There was also a hair in one of the sauces on the table, which we had replaced. It was very concerning they did not check vaccine status.The food was pretty good. I wish they served Iranian breads such as naan-e-sangak or naan-e-lavash instead of the Greek-style mini pitas. Ghormeh Sabzi, the Persian herb stew, was bright and citrusy. The beef was well cooked and perfectly tender. Kebab-e-sultani was great. Also cooked perfectly and tender. No complaints. Desserts were fine. Bastani/Persian ice cream was the best. Beautiful taste of the cardamom. For the price and being a Manhattan restaurant, I was disappointed the rice pudding was served in a plastic container.Ordering desserts was frustrating. While the restaurant wasn't busy at all, the waiter was very distracted. Our party of 4 tried to order dessert, and each time one person gave an order, the waiter tried to walk off without taking everyone's order."

A group of us came this evening to have someone out in the parking lot say they closed at 1am. Okay what was the issue? Not only did they have others park and find out they were closed but a couple who apparently came onto the property walking. That sucks. Not from Staten Island but to visit a place for the first time that was recommended and have this happen is a mind blowing experience, especially when you're hungry."
72,vpkTNjq9dRh9rT3Nh0pe-A,9/26/2021,4 star rating,Always passed by this diner and finally gave a try.  I was reading the review for this restaurant to see why everyone is giving 1 star.  So when I walk in the lady was pretty friendly they ask for vaccine card. They sat us a booth but the booth is too tight so ask if we can sit in the table which they say ok.  The waitress come to our table to see what we want to drink. She brought us water and than ask do we know what to order.  We ask for more time. After about a couple of minutes we order.  I thought the soup come with it but I guess the french onion soup doesn't.  For charge about $3.  Also my mom got fish and ask what potato she sweet potato fries but that didn't come with it either.  The steak was not bad but almost like a quarter of it was all fat. They gave a lot of vegetables and fries.  Will probably come back here again.  The price is reasonable.
73,vpkTNjq9dRh9rT3Nh0pe-A,4/26/2022,4 star rating,They have a very big menu to choose from. It's very nice place and very clean. The service was good. The food came out in great timing.

Hardly any patronage was in the dine and they seated us in the back in the coldest area. When I mentioned to the waitress she didn't offer anything. We were rushed out and the service lacked with no refill on coffee and no water. There so many other better service, other businesses on Staten Island. I don't recommend this place."
76,vpkTNjq9dRh9rT3Nh0pe-A,8/27/2022,1 star rating,"Worst management and customer service experience. I dined here the other day. The food and service were both fine. When I received the bill I noticed there was an extra charge of $3.50 for something I did not order. When I brought it to the waitress' attention, she apologized and said she would take care of it. She brought it to the counter and asked the manager to fix it, but he refused. Instead, the waitress paid for my entire $34 bill on her own.  The manager was punishing the waitress for making an error on the check. I obviously wasn't going to let the waitress eat the bill, so I gave her the cost of the bill plus a tip. In the end, I paid an extra $3.50 for the manager to ""teach his waitress a lesson,"" but in fact he lost a customer. This entire experience was weird. I truly feel bad for the employees at this establishment. This was some of the worst business management I have ever seen!"

78,vpkTNjq9dRh9rT3Nh0pe-A,2/15/2022,5 star rating,Honestly I love this diner. The food is always hot and fresh. The fries are always piping hot and unsalted for the people who worry about that. Also the actual interior is so nicely done.
79,vpkTNjq9dRh9rT3Nh0pe-A,1/30/2022,1 star rating,Ordered 4 salads online. 3 out of the 4 were wrong. Requested no nuts in one of the salads...salad came loaded with nuts (highly allergic). Waited 1hr 20mins and spent $100 on an order that was completely botched. Called the diner to make them aware of their mistake and the manager had an attitude like it was my fault. Keep in mind my order was made online so I was able to actually review my order to verify it wasnt my mistake. Manager did offer to credit me for one of the salads. So for $75 three out of the four of us could eat shit salads delivered an hour and a half later after speaking with a rude manager. In today's economy I recommend choosing the diner who cares about their customers.
80,Gh4TyhJSqL_24fplLvVpGw,7/21/2017,4 star rating,"The roast duck here is super flavorful, unlike some other places where the flavor is only in the skin. $5 for the roast duck over rice and $9 for the half duck. Just getting the duck itself may be the best deal since the rice and cabbage weren't anything special. The Singapore chow mei fun was great, too! Plenty of curry flavor and loaded with bean sprouts, scallions, bell pepper, ham, roast pork, and shrimp. Definitely one of the better Singapore chow mei funs I've had here! $9 buys you a full plate good for two meals."

85,Gh4TyhJSqL_24fplLvVpGw,8/4/2018,5 star rating,"They are the best cheap and good quality rice boxes ranging from $5 and up. Every time my mom works late she would order for all of us, a family of 5, and we would get -beef with tomato-bitter melon and beef-Chinese broccoli and beef- sometimes my mom gets squid with sour vegetables - I usually get the beef with eggplant - my brother usually gets tofu and fish The best part of this restaurant is that when you get take out they usually give soup, tong sui complementary or duck wings (which are sooo good). Classic Cantonese rice boxes! Taste is good :D"
86,Gh4TyhJSqL_24fplLvVpGw,5/28/2014,2 star rating,"Xing Wong is still a relatively new Cantonese bbq, congee, noodle and rice plate restaurant located on the corner of Forsyth Street and East Broadway. It occupies the space of a former Vietnamese restaurant. What is unique about this restaurant is the comparatively vast dining room compared to other area eateries. Since it's still relatively new, the interior still looks clean and shiny. As for the prices, they are standard for the area, in the $5 and up area for noodle and rice dishes.As for the food, what I had was only passable. I had a Chinese broccoli and beef rice plate. There was too much rice and unfortunately what I remembered most about this dish was that the rice was a bit too dry and hard. There was a lot of it too, which made me wish there was more of the beef and broccoli. The restaurant had a good idea in serving their food in large plates. They just need to get the proportion right and add a little more water to their rice. I haven't tried their other dishes or meats, so it will be necessary to check those out. On a final note, service was fast, about 5 to 10 minutes from order to getting our food."

Good basic Cantonese food.  Roasted pork was delicious, the skin was very crispy. Great for take out.Whole Soy sauce chicken: perfectly cooked. The texture was very smooth.Sautéed choy with garlic was basic, same as other restaurants.Wet beef chow fun noodles and curry chow fun noodles were good.The fried fish with vegetables was the winner this meal.  It was perfectly fried but wasn't oily.  The whole fish was precut and topped with choy and spring onions.Servers were very nice and made sure our teapots were full.We were served oranges for dessert. Bill was $95 for 11ppl.  This was a bargain especially for the amount of food that was ordered."

The owner has been here for a while now...I remember when he used to be down the block. A real neighborhood kind of joint with regulars. The service is always good and everyone is friendly. I love the food here. Their Singapore rice noodles and the ""har moon"" mei fun is one the best in Chinatown. The noodles are a little greasy..so this place is probably not for the health-conscious.BBQ meat is decent. I much prefer ordering BBQ meats at Kings Kitchen across the street...but their meats are not bad. Prices are consistent with other restaurants so not much to comment about here.I do like coming here for breakfast as their congee is very thick (just the way I like it). If you go early enough, you can also get the steamed rice rolls with the dried shrimp."

They are crispy and soft at the same time and taste amazing, My only regret is that their coffee is not he best. I'm not a big fan of the flavor and it's a little weak. The service team is great.

Its dirty,salads are almost always spoiled(got their tuna and white fish spread several times within couple of months range and its literally sour/spoiled !!!! ) Its not only terrible since the prices there are high(around $8 + for fish salads/spreads on a bagel) but quite dangerous for consumer's health!!! The owner is an old Jewish man that always looks quite somber and grumpy,he doesnt seem to care about his customers,the quality of food or even the appearance of this establishment that is literally falling apart!

All of their flavors are vegan/GF and they have a cool collection of ones you don't see everyday like lavender, floral, peanut butter and others. I got the maple latte with oat milk. They usually have breakfast tacos but sold out earlier in the day. I got the banana but vegan muffin instead, one of four left of their baked goods. They have inside seating available mostly tables of two but there is one four top, along with tables outside. It didn't take long to get my drink so I chilled for a bit and read.

I got an iced matcha latte and was pleasantly surprised to see they had many flavoring options to add to your drinks. I chose the pistachio and it added the perfect amount of sweetness to my matcha.

But then...but then...the patron before me got a frozen frappacino. Omg y'all. It looked so damn good! (I can say Damn on Yelp right?...*as I think about all the 'damn's* ) I was like, okay! I got more reasons to come back! So I decided to get a vanilla frappe with rose syrup. You can customize the base flavors. I wanna try a vanilla banana frappe next time. It was lit but so cold at the same time. Ha!I was getting all the brain freezes. And happy doing it. If y'all ever had vanilla nutriment. It tasted like a frozen ice cream version. I was in heaven.

My personal favorites are: cheddar bacon burger, curly fries, and the grilled cheese. My bf's favorites: Diablo burger, nachos, and... THE SPECIALS! Omg the specials at GK are true masterpieces. I had the special shrimp tostado... normally I would NEVER trust a bar to make solid shrimp, but the tequila lime marinated shrimp at GK. *chef kiss* THE STAFF! Hilarious and welcoming... I do not drink beer and I'm 99.9% sure GK is a beer bar. The slogan is beer is good... so I felt so obnoxious asking for a glass of wine. absolutely no judgment and the wine is actually decent too.

Mainly because after I turned 30, I became too old to be constantly jostled in unbearably loud, over-crowded bars. But my first time here was during the week, early evening and then it was just my speed. They have a lengthy selection of beers and a neat technologically proficient way of displaying them. But I don't drink beer so that's all I've got on that. Otherwise, it's a full service bar with nice appointments. I found the raised seating in the back perfect for reading, interspersed with blatant people watching. And it's right next to the free popcorn machine.

I tried the eggplant and okra bowl with roasted cabbage. My dish was served warm but was completely lacking in any flavor. It is possible that the cook forgot to put the sauce on.

I got a fried chicken taco and a salmon taco. I gotta be real...I'm from the south so I'm funny bout my chicken. They fried it so hard I could barely chew it. It had flavor but like generic flavor. The salmon was much better. Would I go back just to try something different, probably. But it would just be because it's cheap and fairly good depending on what you get. Service is fast and you might even meet someone cute there. A good space to sit and chat with a friend over some fairly prices food. Really can't ask for more than that."

Tacos and tostadas live harmoniously with ramen and curry on their menu. This is a lively and popular neighborhood spot, and they've continued to thrive by expanding their outdoor dining capacity during COVID. I really enjoyed my basic curry with fried shrimp. Delicious curry, big shrimp, and a very generous portion. We also had the tuna sashimi tostada appetizer special and that really wowed me. I'm not usually tuna person, but they really knocked the flavors out with this dish. Alongside lunch we ordered a sparkling nigori sake, which I'd never tried before. The bubbles really add a refreshing element to the drink. Previously I tried a couple of their tacos. I'll have to make another trip before I settle on my thoughts there, but they're pretty solid. On a future trip I look forward to seeing what the ramen is like, but I have seen that people order it often so I'm sure it's also good."

After 10PM and the cooks at Warude were serving up tasty Asian Fusion and cold beers to the crowds in the most unhurried, cool as a fan fashion. I sat outside at one of their sidewalk tables, people watching for almost an hour, before and after my order. I decided on soft grilled shrimp tacos and an ice cold Japanese, rice based IPA. Almost perfect. Minus a star because the taco shell was a bit on the dried out, crumbly side-just a bit. Warude is still a great place though."

It really comes down to preference.  It was bright and the grilled chicken had an amazing grilled flavor which I prefer paired with rice vs. soup. Next time i'll have the bowl instead."
175,y9GhIt1MLh6344ODA65NQw,8/3/2021,3 star rating,"Warude is a very interesting take on Japanese Mexican fusion. All of the dishes I tried were delicious and very Instagram-worthy.The fried chicken taco and the guacamole were my favorites. There is a wait because they do a lot of takeout orders. So you will see dozens of orders go out before yours. The staff is working hard but it just takes a while. This is not fast food. Seating is very limited. So one person should order the food while the other negotiates with people who are almost done with their food. If you are alone, good luck."
176,y9GhIt1MLh6344ODA65NQw,8/23/2021,3 star rating,"What I liked: *Fun, casual atmosphere *Lots of food options *Lots of beverage options *the taco filling and tortillas were separated by wax paper in the to-go packaging. What I didn't:*My tocos were good, not as tasty as west coast tacos and Mexican food is*Serving Japanese and Mexican is ambitious. Maybe too ambitious. One OR the other might be better The menu was pretty hefty due to serving Mexican and Japanese cuisine. Once I zeroed in on the tacos I was ready to give this place a try. I took one bite into the tacos and remembered that NY Mexican is pretty mediocre. West coast Mexican flood is much more flavorful. I would come back and try the Japanese offerings."

And when it's this good, no one's gonna question why you can get a salmon miso bowl and a chicken mole taco at the same restaurant. Anyone gatekeeping authenticity should look no further than Warude's own website, which explains that the origin of the fish taco began when Japanese fisherman in Mexico put fish tempura in tortillas. It stands to reason that anything that tastes good can be put into a tortilla to make a delicious taco, hence their menu which features tacos with unique ingredients like sweet yam and crispy chicken skin. I love that they underscore that in a global world, all food is fusion, and the way they combine Japanese and Mexican ingredients is a well executed fusion I can get behind.Everything I ordered was fantastic, from the grilled shrimp taco to the fried cod fish taco and the tortilla soup. Even the simple side of rice and beans was enjoyable, made even better by their really fantastic hot sauce. It enhanced the flavor of everything I doused it on, which was everything. Both tacos were hefty enough to feel okay about paying $5.95 per taco for, and flavorful enough to consider ordering another one or three. My partner was really impressed with their crispy chicken skin taco and fried chicken taco, both fillings you don't normally see paired with tortillas but worked very well together. I'd love to return for one of their Japanese curry bowls and definitely the chips with cod fish and horseradish dip.This is very much a popular neighborhood spot, so the handful of sidewalk tables they set up outside will often be full. The tables turnover quickly though so a table will likely vacate by the time you order, pay at the register, and wait for them to call your ticket number. The owner is also a musician who plays Afro-Caribbean, African and Japanese drums. On his website he writes about how much touring around the world has influenced his outlook on food culture, the environment, and music which all sound kind of random but once you understand the through line it makes dining at Warude all the more enjoyable."

Food Is Never Overcooked, It's Just Perfect! There's A Bathroom Available For Use. The Tables Are Quite Small And If You Come In The Summer You May Not Initially Be Able To Get A Seat.

We were very hungry. Even though I wanted waffles, I ordered a bowl of fruit granola yogurt by mistake (the yogurt was listed under the waffles section so I assumed it was waffles topped with some yogurt, granola, and fruits. I was wrong). I was a bit bummed but the fruit was fresh. The granola tasted like crushed Nature Valley granola bar, so it was more like big cookie crumbles. My friend ordered the lumberjack pancakes and couldn't eat the whole thing, so we ended up sharing and all was good. They have a pretty big outdoor dining section and can accommodate probably around seven people in a group (we were a group of seven). Coffee was pretty good and it was bottomless."

Where some dishes just never came out right.  Cold sesame noodles had too much vinegar.  Staff has been arrogant when told there was something wrong with there food. NOW there staples have take a dive.  How do you mess with Wanton Soup?  Soggy wontons (undercooked missy mess) broth taste is off its darker than usual,   The sweet and sour shrimp the batter shrimp was undercooked soft mushy batter with over cooked shrimp inside.  They split the shrimp into and bread in a ring.  Making u think u get more shrimp but in reality the shrimp is scrawny. The sweet and sour sauce was missing the fruit (stingy), They changed the sauce I the pan fried dumpings. Uck. I'm not going back."

I paid online but had to sign the receipt when the order came. I put 0 tip on the receipt because I had cash. The delivery man had the nerve to ask me if i was going to give him a tip. Not ordering from here again.

226,ft4-eCqO3kukSCsOChMV_g,11/1/2014,5 star rating,"Never had a bad dish in this joint, at worst it's been ""Really freakin' good"". Beef with Asparagus and Mushrooms is delicious, anything in garlic sauce is delicious, really. Egg Rolls are super crisp on the outside, and super moist on the inside (none of that raw cabbage bs places try to give you). Scallion Pancakes run the same way, crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. Pork Fried Rice has a slightly charred taste to it, tastes like it's cooked in an extremely well seasoned Wok, excellent stuff. EDIT: Almost forgot, Wonton soup is delicious. Broth is a really rich stock. Older gentleman working inside the place would drive you home if he could. Incredibly kind, attentive, and giving. He tried carrying my bag out to my car for me, and I was astonished. Flavors are very, very Brooklyn in terms of Chinese, with less grease, if that makes sense. All in all I'm a huge Chinese snob (Wo Hops being the best) and I've tried all the other ""bests"" (Tacks) and this place is delish. A remodel wouldn't hurt but I'm not there to stare at curtains. Girl who does take out is incredibly sweet, speaks perfect english. No confusion here."

Did they change kitchen staff. Who knows,but I ordered dinner one night last week that was just awful! So bad, I tossed it out. Shrimp tasted like it was cooked frozen so it was very mushy & tasteless. Rest of meal looked & tasted like it was Re heated. Not fresh. My advice is don't waste your $$$"

My mother in law found a metal tag on her duck! I ordered shrimp with mixed veggies and the shrimp was slimey and had a strong fishy smell and taste. It definitely wasn't fresh. My husband called them to tell them and one of the delivery men came to pick up the slime from my home and argued with us that the food was fine and even slammed our storm door! We will never go back. I'd rather go to the other side of the Island than deal with the awful food and Bipolar Asians at this place."
229,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,4/24/2019,4 star rating,"A new-ish neighborhood establishment located a couple of blocks away from where I live, the name always makes me think of ""Panda Cafe"" and they have a super cute panda mascot. The interior is nice and clean, with several high seats and white countertops lining the space by the window, allowing room for customers to dine in if desired. There was a large menu for drinks and bubble tea, including milk teas, fruity flavors, smoothies, latte and more. They also have an extensive sushi menu, as well as salt and pepper fried chicken, french fries and chicken nuggets. The first time I visited, I ordered the shrimp tempura sushi and salt and pepper chicken. The sushi had a drizzle of yummy sauce and the shrimp tempura was lightly crispy. There was also sliced cucumber and onion, which tasted wonderfully fresh. The salt and pepper chicken was extremely flavorful, juicy, and delightfully crunchy. It was so good that it didn't need any sauce.I also tried a couple of their drinks, which are very reasonably priced. The small size is $3.50, the medium is $4.50 and large is $5.50. I had the almond taro smoothie and white peach smoothie. The almond taro smoothie was such a treat - I was able to taste both flavors really well and they mingled together perfectly. The addition of one topping is free, so I had it with tapioca pearls, which was just okay. The quality of the boba isn't as high as other places. It was a bit too chewy and slightly mushy. The white peach was decent, but it didn't have the pure flavor I was expecting - It was too artificial and sweet. I wanted to get purple rice with that but they didn't have that available yet, so I chose the rainbow jelly. Red, orange, and white in color, they were quite enjoyable.Most recently, I had chicken nuggets and french fries. I asked if they had sauce other than ketchup and the chef let me have some of the spicy mayo that is usually reserved only for the sushi. That spicy mayo was sooo tasty and enhanced the already delicious chicken nuggets and fries. The chicken nuggets were very tender and succulent, bursting with great seasoning. The fries were skinny, just the way I like them and full of potato-y goodness.The service is pleasant. The folks behind the counter are lovely - patient and helpful. They seem to know the menu well and make informed recommendations. There are quite a few drinks I would like to get and I really hope they will have the purple rice topping soon. I will definitely be back!"
230,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,4/6/2019,4 star rating,"I'm going to be honest, the main reason I went inside this restaurant was because of their name. Is it Anda or Panda?  Anyway, I'm glad I went in. They have a pretty good selection of bubble teas and snacks. This place is fairly small but bright and airy and clean since they just opened last month. The back area is a small grocery store of sorts that sells more Asian snacks, drinks and ice cream. I only gave this section a quick glance on my first visit. I was mainly interested in the front area where they sell bubble tea, small plates of food and sushi. I ordered their Thai-ro milk tea and salmon avocado roll. The sushi roll was decent. The Thai-ro was seriously delicious and very pretty to look at. It's a combo of Thai ice tea and taro flavor. Had no idea that these two flavors would mesh so well. I can't wait to go back and try some other flavors of bubble tea."
231,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,8/16/2021,3 star rating,"I've passed this place dozens of time and today I decided to finally try it. They had a large menu with many options for sushi, drinks and more. I got a large oreo bubble milk tea for $5.50 (not bad pricing) and takoyaki (6pc for $4.50, also not bad at all). However, after going home and opening my box of takoyaki I can surely say I'm disappointed. I'm not sure what happened to the presentation, maybe it was my travel home but I'm quite sad there's no sauce or well, anything really. The bubble tea was alright nothing too special, tasted a little weird maybe because of the Oreo + Tea combination. tldr; mediocre food for a reasonable price, good for if you're starving and have nowhere else to go."

Their drinks are relatively cheap compared to most bubble tea places these days and their small will only run you $3.50. While it is cheap, it def shows in the quality. It's not the best bubble tea but they do have a variety of flavors and it's one of the only places that offers purple rice as a topping! Their purple rice milk tea is prob my fav thing on the menu. This Anda Cafe offers sushi and shaved ice, which is different compared to the other branches."

236,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,4/27/2019,4 star rating,The coconut milk tea was good but way too sweet. I also wish it had a stronger tea flavor rather than the milk & ice overpowering the tea.

After we paid and walked out with the drink, we noticed that they had not included any tapioca bubbles, so we went back in only for them to tell us they had run out! They hadn't bothered to tell us when we placed the order and they didn't offer any substitutes. It's not a big deal and we would have excused it but the drink honestly tasted really bad-- it tastes nothing like taro! For some reason it tastes like cherries! Very disappointed with our purchase here. Also, we asked if we could adjust the sugar level and the cashier told us that they don't use sugar. I'm looking at the pictures that other yelpers posted, and there is clearly a photo of sugar level options!!! We should have turned around and demanded a refund. My father is not one to waste food, but he took one sip of the tea and even he said to throw it out!"

Even Paulie Gee's has now opened a second pizzeria that sells by the slice (gasp)!So when i come to the Cafe Riviera, i feel myself entering a kinder and gentler place in a time warp.  The young women behind the counter are very helpful, some with distinctly European accents. The baked goods in the case are all familiar items, tarts and danishes taking up the large glass enclosed cases up front, and some of the fancier Italianesque refrigerated pastries (as in eclairs) in the case near the register.It is a tight narrow venue with small tables lining the wall to the left with the pastry cases and the aforementioned young ladies to the right. It is almost as if the seating in the cafe was an afterthought, as i have visited many neighborhood bakeries such as this which were strictly bakeries, and coffee was only served years after operating without. The clientele is mostly made up of local residents, (many elderly and of Polish descent) as this place is truly a hidden gem, that has not changed a bit in decades.  And i am most thankful for that. Clearly, one of my very favorite places in New York to grab a fresh and delicious peach tart.  Thank you."
242,Aa934EMuqCdEV86faZG-0A,9/15/2018,4 star rating,"I'm pleasantly surprised with the quality and the price of Cafe Riviera's pastries and desserts. I have heard good things about the cafe, but was always reticent to check it out for myself because I have my favorites already. My mom and I shared the slice of strawberry cheesecake and a Black Forest pastry. The top layer of mousse was light and flavorful, almost whimsical on top of the chocolate cake base topped with black cherries. The one drawback was that it was slightly frozen in the middle so for that I have to deduct a star. Is it made here? Is it frozen and unfrozen to serve or is the cooler to cold? The cheesecake was not chilled but the right temperature and smooth. The strawberries on top colder than the cheesecake but for the price, it can't be beat. Two desserts and a bottle of water for $8 is definitely a steal, especially in this neighborhood of hipsters."

I bought two birthday cakes and I wanted to write happy birthday on them- as any normal person buying cake would expect. The owner went on ranting that I didn't ask for writing on a birthday cake fast enough for her, so she wrapped it up... I told her what cakes I wanted and She just abruptly walked away and with her back turned I tried to get her attention for several minutes, but she didn't hear me through the glass, then proceeded to raise her voice at me, that I did not ask her to write anything! Her awful attitude and costumer service made me hate this place. She made it seem like she's doing me a favor!I told her that her customer service was terrible and she just laughed at me. End of the story -she never apologized and it just shows she can care less because the place is constantly busy....

And they taste amazing. Classics executed perfectly, with a little something extra that's hard to achieve at home.Service is friendly, although the counters are very high and the walkway narrow, so it can get a little hard to communicate when it's crowded (maybe that's part of the charm)?Cash only.

We came here on a Sunday night, and the atmosphere here is just slightly cleaner and more upscale than you would expect of a ""dive bar,"" but the people there are just so friendly, that you actually forget you're in NYC. Since it's the holiday time, the place is decorated with twinkle lights and a tree, which look so nice with the exposed brick interior.The prices also help you forget you're in NYC! Their Bob's Pilsner is $4, and well drinks are $8. It looked like well drinks go down to $6 for happy hour, Monday through Thursday. It seemed like because it was an off-peak night, we had no problem finding a place to sit, but I'd assume that wouldn't be the case for any night Thursday-Saturday. The vibe was like a perfect nighttime coffee shop that served liquor, basically an ideal situation for a Sunday night."

The interior is purposely decorated like a dive bar (the menu is sketched on the wall and there's a lot of reclaimed wood features in the interior design).

I could see this being a great place for happy hour with friends and it has a  neighborhood college bar vibe. The nightlife in this area is pretty tame, despite the proximity to Columbia so it's nice to have whatever you can get. They have A shuffleboard table in the back but there is no clear system for signing up or getting a turn and it was pretty much impossible to play on a Saturday night. There are also a few boardgames but not very many. We played Connect Four until it got really crowded and we decided to move on."

Bartender Mike is awesome as he and I hung out at the mostly empty bar until a huge group came in. So yeah, this place is great for groups or just hanging on your own after work.  The place has dimmed lighting and plenty of seating and space.I personally miss the days when one could hula hoop or shoot billiards in the middle of the bar, but I guess I have to let go of the past. Crowd is friendly across the board, so you can always socialize without feeling cramped. They are dog friendly, so don't be shocked when you see a little leashed pooch at your feet! Although Uncle Bob doesn't feed you, he will let you order whatever you want and have it delivered to the bar-- or you can bring your own. Overall, the place is laid back with low key decor in the way that the owners outfitted The Gibson in Brooklyn. Nice to know one can get the same atmosphere uptown. Incredible prices for both happy hour and non happy hour. The bar is well stocked and has a large, beautiful mirror that I missed taking a photo of. Did I mention that they have JELLO SHOTS ($3 or 4 for $10)?!?! Score!I will definitely be back!"

I never really had a bad experience, and quite a few of the baristas knew my name and made my customer experience very memorable honestly (I now frequent a less busy Starbucks in a quiet part of Seattle and only 1 manager has learned my name after a year).See a lot of complaints about lack of a restroom, but I think that's pretty typical in smaller shops that cater to office workers who are just stopping by for a pick-me-up in the morning or afternoon so don't really see why people are attacking a franchise store for a smaller layout -- my current Starbucks only has 4 little stool-seats (and no restroom)!"

They had inexplicable closed off one section of the seating to mop a floor that didn't appear to be dirty/wet or anything. Shouldn't that have been done AFTER the place closed so that your customers have a place to sit?? This was around 7pm and customers were still coming in and out - it wasn't like the place was dead or anything.The staff are all very young and the young lady making my drink didn't seem to know how exactly to make my tea. She couldn't locate all the ingredients and one of the containers didn't have tongs to take out what she needed so she proceeded to tumble the contents into my cup rather than locate the tong and remove the proper quantity to make my drink. Not very scientific measuring. Another gentleman ordered the same thing I did but just a larger cup of it. After she poured his drink, there must have been another inch or so to fill it up so she just dumped in extra ice to make up the difference. I knew he was short-changed and, judging by his reaction, so did he.They don't have any restrooms for customer use, so beware if you're someone who needs to run to the can after downing a lot of coffee. I guess that's one way they can turn over customers and prevent people from buying a cup of joe and camping out there for several hours."

All the other co workers were great and they had our backs. He also got our order wrong and I think he should not be an starbucks employee. Starbucks is about the service and coffee...

With a much larger, more modern space, this Starbucks definitely got an upgrade. No longer is there a line that fills up the entire space. There is plenty of seating - yes, even bathrooms - and the same friendly baristas that gave the location it's welcoming feel. Welcome to 2015: Starbucks 54th and Broadway."
304,Aa934EMuqCdEV86faZG-0A,12/4/2017,1 star rating,"I always liked this Starbucks because it has a fair amount of seating and is in a convenient location, but either Starbucks has a ridiculous new water policy or it's just the way this location is managed. I went up to ask for a cup of water to take medicine because we forgot to order it when we got coffee and a snack.  One friendly staff member said it would be no problem, until another guy stepped in and was like, ""No, actually you need to order that at the register.""I must have had a confused or incredulous look on my face, because he then added that otherwise they lose money on the cup.  A multi-billion-dollar corporation that is so worried about losing money on a single cup that they would make you wait in a long line for a cup of water? Pass. I thought he was joking at first, but he was completely serious and then I later heard him lecturing the other woman about water.Have never had this happen at any other Starbucks before, so either it's a new policy or this location is just unreasonable or unaccommodating. Don't see a return visit in the future, since denying customers the basic courtesy of a cup of tap water is one of my biggest pet peeves, especially if you've already ordered other things and contributed to the bottom line."
305,Aa934EMuqCdEV86faZG-0A,12/10/2017,2 star rating,"Honestly, most Starbucks I go to are fine and would be 3 stars, but I have to downgrade this one specifically because of the rudeness of one employee and the apparent cleanliness issues at this location.First things first, the woman who took my order was perfectly nice, and she's the only reason this review isn't a 1 star. There were no problems there, and my order was fulfilled just fine. However, even after buying a drink and a snack we forgot to get a cup of water for my wife. She went up to the woman who helped me to ask for one, and she was about to get it when one of the guys that worked told her no because ""they would lose money on the cup"". Are you serious? A multi-billion dollar company with average store sales of over a million dollars per is worried about the cost of a single plastic cup? After not getting her cup of water, my wife even overheard the male employee chastising the female employee for agreeing to get us a cup of water.I have never, in any other Starbucks I've ever been to, seen this type of behavior behind the counter. From refusing a cup of water to openly chastising a fellow coworker, this Starbucks doesn't deserve my or my wife's business, and it really doesn't deserve anyone else's. Just go a block or two in any direction and patronize one of the million other Starbucks in Manhattan.To top it all off, I noticed that the pour-over machine was filthy. Old coffee grounds looked like they were stuck to the device, and it definitely didn't look like it was properly cleaned from the last usage. Thankfully I didn't get a pour over coffee as those tend to be my go-to choices at other coffee shops. Simply disgusting."

All the other co workers were great and they had our backs. He also got our order wrong and I think he should not be an starbucks employee. Starbucks is about the service and coffee... Jamell is not a good face to the starbucks franchise.
330,69X4XVef3NRV_LlIvEuXug,10/27/2021,1 star rating,When ordering a Venti beverage I don't want a small coffee with a half cup of foam. I received this latte in my hotel room and it was 50% latte and 50% foam. I think I would have gotten more latte in a smaller size and saved money as well. Just bad...
331,69X4XVef3NRV_LlIvEuXug,5/29/2018,4 star rating,I love this place bc it's close to the NQR trains and I like their variety of seating. Spacious and also love the high ceilings!The music is loud and it's location draws the TS crowd but I like that it's open late. It's across from the Late Show/Stephen Colbert.

The wait was very long and they made my drink order incorrectly. One particular employee made me seem like a bother when I asked them to fix it, saying I was just ""wasting time"". Well here I am wasting more time leaving a negative review. Save your money and go to the guy in the corner cart. No line, better pricing, and better service."

With a much larger, more modern space, this Starbucks definitely got an upgrade. No longer is there a line that fills up the entire space. There is plenty of seating - yes, even bathrooms - and the same friendly baristas that gave the location it's welcoming feel. Welcome to 2015: Starbucks 54th and Broadway."
334,69X4XVef3NRV_LlIvEuXug,12/4/2017,1 star rating,"I always liked this Starbucks because it has a fair amount of seating and is in a convenient location, but either Starbucks has a ridiculous new water policy or it's just the way this location is managed. I went up to ask for a cup of water to take medicine because we forgot to order it when we got coffee and a snack.  One friendly staff member said it would be no problem, until another guy stepped in and was like, ""No, actually you need to order that at the register.""I must have had a confused or incredulous look on my face, because he then added that otherwise they lose money on the cup.  A multi-billion-dollar corporation that is so worried about losing money on a single cup that they would make you wait in a long line for a cup of water? Pass. I thought he was joking at first, but he was completely serious and then I later heard him lecturing the other woman about water.Have never had this happen at any other Starbucks before, so either it's a new policy or this location is just unreasonable or unaccommodating. Don't see a return visit in the future, since denying customers the basic courtesy of a cup of tap water is one of my biggest pet peeves, especially if you've already ordered other things and contributed to the bottom line."
335,69X4XVef3NRV_LlIvEuXug,12/10/2017,2 star rating,"Honestly, most Starbucks I go to are fine and would be 3 stars, but I have to downgrade this one specifically because of the rudeness of one employee and the apparent cleanliness issues at this location.First things first, the woman who took my order was perfectly nice, and she's the only reason this review isn't a 1 star. There were no problems there, and my order was fulfilled just fine. However, even after buying a drink and a snack we forgot to get a cup of water for my wife. She went up to the woman who helped me to ask for one, and she was about to get it when one of the guys that worked told her no because ""they would lose money on the cup"". Are you serious? A multi-billion dollar company with average store sales of over a million dollars per is worried about the cost of a single plastic cup? After not getting her cup of water, my wife even overheard the male employee chastising the female employee for agreeing to get us a cup of water.I have never, in any other Starbucks I've ever been to, seen this type of behavior behind the counter. From refusing a cup of water to openly chastising a fellow coworker, this Starbucks doesn't deserve my or my wife's business, and it really doesn't deserve anyone else's. Just go a block or two in any direction and patronize one of the million other Starbucks in Manhattan.To top it all off, I noticed that the pour-over machine was filthy. Old coffee grounds looked like they were stuck to the device, and it definitely didn't look like it was properly cleaned from the last usage. Thankfully I didn't get a pour over coffee as those tend to be my go-to choices at other coffee shops. Simply disgusting."

I never really had a bad experience, and quite a few of the baristas knew my name and made my customer experience very memorable honestly (I now frequent a less busy Starbucks in a quiet part of Seattle and only 1 manager has learned my name after a year).See a lot of complaints about lack of a restroom, but I think that's pretty typical in smaller shops that cater to office workers who are just stopping by for a pick-me-up in the morning or afternoon so don't really see why people are attacking a franchise store for a smaller layout -- my current Starbucks only has 4 little stool-seats (and no restroom)!"

As a matter of fact this Bucks does not have a bathroom so theydirect you to the other one down the block. Strictly in and out here not a place for quiet internetting, go dow the block for that. Always a line but moves okay for straight coffee orders but fancy drinks will take a little longer. I use this location because it is next to the Davidoff cigar smoking lounge so I can kickback with a venti and a cigar."
341,M3esPgE0_F_VUzCnQc5Qig,9/5/2016,2 star rating,"Not one of my favorite Starbucks locations. Stopped by here last week before dinner at a nearby restaurant. They had inexplicable closed off one section of the seating to mop a floor that didn't appear to be dirty/wet or anything. Shouldn't that have been done AFTER the place closed so that your customers have a place to sit?? This was around 7pm and customers were still coming in and out - it wasn't like the place was dead or anything.The staff are all very young and the young lady making my drink didn't seem to know how exactly to make my tea. She couldn't locate all the ingredients and one of the containers didn't have tongs to take out what she needed so she proceeded to tumble the contents into my cup rather than locate the tong and remove the proper quantity to make my drink. Not very scientific measuring. Another gentleman ordered the same thing I did but just a larger cup of it. After she poured his drink, there must have been another inch or so to fill it up so she just dumped in extra ice to make up the difference. I knew he was short-changed and, judging by his reaction, so did he.They don't have any restrooms for customer use, so beware if you're someone who needs to run to the can after downing a lot of coffee. I guess that's one way they can turn over customers and prevent people from buying a cup of joe and camping out there for several hours."

After having paid and waited a good 10 minutes, I was told that they did not have the ingredients to make the caramel frapp. Fast forward to present day...lol *smh*  I have a Starbucks Groupon $5 for $10 deal. I returned to this location to get a Caramel Ribbon Crunch Cream Frappuccino. Not one crunch. I was really looking forward to those lil crunchy things...which is why I ordered it. I get to work, take some sips... They gave me a Caramel Ribbon Crunchless Cream Frapp. Maybe, once again, they didn't have the ingredients? I dunno. It's just funny that I've only gone here maybe twice over the 15 years that I've worked in the area. Neither time did I get what I ordered.

I have come to this Starbucks a handful of times and the staff is consistently slow and rude. Today they did not even tell me when my latte was ready (just handed me my bagel without saying anything and when I walked to the drink pick-up my drink was awkwardly up on a ledge - not on the empty counter space -  and I had to ask if it was mine) and even then my drink tasted off. This was the final straw in a string of bad experiences and I was already coming here only as a last resort (the other locations had long lines or were closed) but will not be returning to this location again.

The baked clams were also great.  We will definitely be coming back. It's one of those small neighborhood places that is so underrated and no one would think the food was that good. If you're looking for a little gem close to or near Whitestone look no further than Erin's Isle. People should be talking about this place. I would give it a 4.3.

It's a great room the only downside is that the entrance to the kitchen is back there so servers will be coming in and out of the room while you're eating there. We had some appetizers, my favorite was the Gigi salad. It had shrimp, delicious green beens, and crispy bacon. The bacon was the highlight and the house made vinaigrette was addicting. For my entree, I had the linguine vongole (white clam sauce). I had this dish for the first time in Italy and fell in love. The sauce for this pasta was really good, filled up my dipping my bread in it. My only critique would be was there was lots of small clams on top out of the shell and only a few big clams. This dish would have been made much better if they used more smaller clams.We brought our own cake but their dessert tray looked delicious. Will have to come back and try them next time!"

Then result had to be masked with a healthy amount of black pepper (they never offered offered fresh ground, so it was straight from the shaker). It was way too fishy tasting. A dollop of creme fresh or sour cream might have helped, as would a couple chunks of lobster.The linguine with red clam sauce was salty but good.

My filet mignon was good,  but my niece found hers to be too chewy.  The shrimp and scallop special was the best entree out of all of them.  It was very good!  The halibut and salmon were also very good.  The seafood over linguini was just ok.  My mom didn't like her breaded chicken at all.  The potatoes and vegetables that certain dishes came with was very good and well seasoned.  I also ordered a side of creamed spinach which was just ok.  It could have been more creamier.  Would I ever come to dine here?  Probably not.  But,  I wouldn't mind coming if my sister wanted to go again as some dishes were very good.  They can really work on their appetizers to be much better though.  The place is very clean and newly renovated.  It was very nice inside,  and food wasn't a long wait either."

The food is usually at least each time I have gone there fresh and the price is affordable.  It is a good place for lunch, but just know do not go there for a quiet little lunch spot, this place is always busy, crowded and usually loud.  However, you can always grab food that is really good and either go eat in the park or go back to the office with it. They always have a lot of options and everything is always fresh.  The staff there tries to get everyone in and out quickly and keep smiles and friendly the whole entire time. I have not met a rude staff member yet that works there.  Just like a set for a place to grab your lunch and go, and usually gives you a great healthy food option - this should be the place you do for lunch if you are nearby you will not regret it."

There is a large variety of cuisines both in the buffets, prepared foods, and snack sections. The service at the deli is super fast. I love their breakfast wraps and sandwiches. They will make any sandwich for you (even if it's not listed on their menu). Salads from the salad bar are always fresh. I haven't had any of the other buffet items, but everyone is always raving about it. There is a $7 credit card minimum. There are a few tables if you want to eat there, but I've only ever done grab & go. In the nice weather, they open up their windows/doors which is nice.Check it out the next time you need a quick snack!"
381,8oHCb-XvLpqCQD7En17Fzw,12/2/2014,5 star rating,"I eat here all the time. I follow a relatively strict diet and their lunch bar is absolutely perfect for getting exactly what I want for a good price that actually tastes great. There is a lot of variety. Just today I got a delicious lunch of a Chicken leg, some asparagus, penne pasta, a hard boiled egg, and a full avocado for under $7 and it was delicious. Of course, the price will depend on your portion size since it goes by weight.I haven't tried most of the made-to-order items yet, but I can absolutely recommend the Sundooboo (soft Tofu stew). I usually get it extra spicy with an egg and bulgogi. Very filling and tasty. This has become my new go-to lunch spot."
382,8oHCb-XvLpqCQD7En17Fzw,12/18/2017,1 star rating,"This review is on the Ramen soup only as I have not tried any other food here. The price of the ramen soup is what attracted me at first, $7.99 for a huge cup is hard to beat! But despite what the pictures next to the prices will have you believe, this is not the ramen soup you're expecting. This tastes like a cup-of-noodles ramen with toppings they picked up from the salad bar. So sliced carrots, red and orange peppers, grilled and cut up chicken, mushrooms. They asked me if I wanted an egg and I excitedly said yes! Not realizing that they absolutely did not mean a soft boiled egg, but a separately fried egg that was then plopped into the soup. The noodles are over cooked and taste like mush at this point. Listen, all and all, it's edible. I'll eat it for lunch today and never get it again. But let this be a warning for everyone who wants a semi traditional bowl of ramen, do NOT expect it at this place, you will be disappointed"

The food gave me food poisoning and i was sick for a good five days. On top of that, the staff were very unfriendly when i was making my purchase and didn't even acknowledge me when i greeted them. They just took my money and that was it. Oh how I miss the days of polite service.This place is not worth the pain. Trust me."

Outside of that, there is nothing special about this place. Got the chicken wrap... Chicken was bland and tasteless and didnt help the sandwich out much. Standard deli fare, but nothing about any of the ingredients made me excited in any capacity. I may stop by if I'm in the neighborhood again for something but nothing to make a special trip for."
386,8oHCb-XvLpqCQD7En17Fzw,8/6/2015,4 star rating,"This place is my lunch time jam. Of all the general buffets run by Koreans in Chinatown, this is the spot to hit up (okay, I only know like one other buffet/deli run by Koreans in Chinatown, but you get what I mean). My work gets off for lunch right around 1PM and that's when it starts getting crowded here. I mean, it's not too bad. Every once in a while an old Asian lady will elbow me away from the hot bar as she forces her way to the broccoli beef. And the salad line isn't too bad at all.The Hot Bar: I think it's about $7.99 a pound, or something around there, for selections ranging from typically: bbq pork ribs (no bones), boiled brisket, broccoli beef, spinach lasagna, meat lasagna, fried chicken, pork spare ribs, general tso's chicken, chicken teriyaki, sausage with onions, mac and cheese, alfredo pasta, fried rice, vermicelli noodles, chow mein, steamed-ish dumplings, and chicken + green beans. And a whole ton of other goodies, but usually those above are always there. Clearly I spend way too much time here if I can remember their entire freaking menu. I usually pack in the brisket because it's super moist, juicy, and FATTY. If you don't like fat, avoid it like the plague. I'm trying to clog my arteries and die at 30 so it's ok for me to do it. The alfredo pasta with chicken is pretty good too (albeit oily) and the lasagna is to die for. Well, you probably will die from it eventually so...But my new found love goes to the salad bar, which includes 6 toppings and dressings for a total of about $8.40 tax included. My favorite? Parmesan peppercorn dressing with roasted chicken, purple cabbage, avocados, spicy corn mix, alfalfa, and scallion. MMMmmm. Delicious! Or get extra chicken instead of a veggie. Super filling!Not much space here (I hear there is an upstairs? but the back has no AC so if you like burning to death, be my guest). My suggestion? To go and enjoy elsewhere."
387,8oHCb-XvLpqCQD7En17Fzw,11/6/2018,1 star rating,Very rude staff especially the men who work behind the deli making sandwiches. They seem to cater to customers they know which is not a lot of customers to begin with not surprised given how rude they are and those customers lack manners as they tend to skip the line without any regard to those who are waiting. This rude behavior is encouraged by the staff. The food is nothing special just convienent and available. There are numerous cafe's that are in the area with the same type of food and quality. The quality of the food seems ok however way overpriced for the type and quality of food available to be fair this is apparent in many of the cafe's in the area. Best to avoid these generic cafe's this one and all the generic ones in the area.

However, I am concerned that quite frequently their employees do not conform to basic norms of safe food handling. On several occasions I have noticed they do not wear gloves   when pouring soup from the  soup pot into the cup. Yesterday  I witnessed an employee lick his fingers while he was pouring soup into my cup. In the past I have reported this issue but the problem persists. Go at your own risk!!"

In fact, I purposefully try to avoid this particular store, even that means I have to walk 10 more minutes to their other location in Soho.I live nearby and dropped by this store on my Saturday morning jog twice. Both times the store attendants threw me attitude, as below:1st time: Me: ""Good morning, I have the JPRun Club!""The store attendant *grasp my phone, stare at my picture, and pout his lips*: ""Ha, interesting, interesting, you're not even sweating, you are clearly a liar"". And it was not a joke! He said it in the meanest attitude possible. It was 35 degree out and he questioned why I didn't sweat? And did he just call me name? Excuse me, what?2nd time, more than a month later:Me: ""Hello, I attend the jprunclub, can I get a juice?""This time THREE of them passed my phone around (?!), stared at a picture I posted, and started commenting on it and talking to each other as if I had disappeared: ""Yeah these people are getting ridiculous. They're insane""Really? Did they just call me insane and ridiculous?And that is after I have paid thousands of dollars on Juice Press products since moving to the city a year ago. Needless to say, I will never ever visit this location again. If they don't get rid of those 3 people working 10am-12pm on Saturday, that is. Juice Press, please do something about this and do not let these terrible employees drive your customers away!"

430,AahdCoFHilyFDqoljCpvgw,11/3/2022,3 star rating,"Idk why this place is sooo raves about when it's good but not incredible! I ordered dumplings to go and the dumpling dough was super thick, only pork option. It's very different from the soho dumplings, which are better than the regular steamed pork dumplings. The sauce container was inside the dumpling to-go box, but the dumplings were so hot the steam melted the plastic of the sauce container, which went everywhere. I recommend asking for the sauce outside of the dumpling container! It seems a bit toxic to have the plastic melt in the dumpling container. The staff is ok but not particularly friendly ... lots of orders were takeout while I was waiting for my food. Perhaps I'll need to try more of their signature dishes but was honestly underwhelmed the past 2 visits"
431,AahdCoFHilyFDqoljCpvgw,3/11/2022,1 star rating,"Let me preface this by stating that as a true foodie I don't mind spending money on quality food. Spy C Cuisine missed its mark by a long shot. We were truly baffled by the incredibly small takeout portions that we received. Luckily I ordered food from another restaurant to add to our dinner. My hunny picked out the items he wanted us to try. I ordered Beef Garlic Sauce Style, General Tso's Chicken, Beef In Pancakes, and two orders of White Rice. I couldn't help but instantly become angry when I looked at the tiny laughable take out portions. The food we received was definitely not enough for two people or to have leftovers for the next day. The beef garlic sauce style was tasty but needed more beef. The general tso's chicken tasted like orange chicken (not a fan), and the beef in pancakes was too oily. We've definitely had better. We only received one order of white rice instead of two. Oh and I was charged for each rice. I used my 50% discount via UberEats which brought the total of our meal to $45.35. It was still too much money to spend on food that was mediocre. Be forewarned the portions are the size of a lunchable. We both agreed that we would never order from here again."

We love the Xiao Long Bao, Kung Bao chicken and cumin beef. The flavors were very authentic. The spicy popcorn chicken was a little doughy and the hot chili fish was a little oily to my taste but my husband loved it. We are trying different dishes every time we visit as they have so many options on the menu. The service was amazing. The waiter was always super friendly and remembered our drink order the second time we went. We felt really comfortable and welcomed. The inside seating area was bigger than we thought and the interior was nice and beautiful with hand-painted Chinese art on the wall. The dining experience was really nice and I did see a lot of people coming for takeout orders. If you live in the neighborhood, you won't regret giving Spicy C a try! We are certainly happy to have found this place."

This is hands down, the BEST Chinese food place in all of Forest Hills. We were thrilled to discover! My favorite dish is the eggplant with brown sauce. We also love their scallion pancakes. I love to order their egg drop soup and my husband is a big fan of their hot and sour soup. My husband has tried a few of their dishes and of course I take a bite. I am loyal to the eggplant in brown sauce dish as it is the best I have ever had and that is my favorite Chinese food dish. My husband has tried the Kung Pao chicken, the double cooked chicken, and the sesame shredded beef. Not one dish has disappointed. We are HUGE fans!"
434,AahdCoFHilyFDqoljCpvgw,8/11/2022,1 star rating,"Just ordered in from spy c cuisine. $102 for absolute garbage. My family and I are very upset. First of all there was no rice. Rice did not come with any of the three main dishes we ordered where it always used to.The hot and sour soup was disgusting. It was worse than any we have ever had, watery, weak, all broth and no substance. The scallion pancake with beef was completely undercooked and tasteless. Also there was no hoisin sauce neither in the pancake nor on the side.The Hot sauce style chicken was all liquid. It used to be chock-full of tender chicken and it was delicious. While the taste was similar, the substance was completely inadequate. We asked for pork in scallion sauce and were told they no longer have pork, we ordered the beef. For $20 we received a small portion of eight pieces of beef with mostly onions and a few scallions.We routinely order crispy shredded beef from Bund so we decided to try it here. OMG. This beef was tiny shriveled hard fried pieces of an un-identifiable substance, tossed with dried hot pepper. No sauce. It was horrific and disgusting and also $20.The cold cucumber salad was delicious as always however for the price the portion has gotten much smaller. I will say the same for the pork soup dumplings, they were good. But arrived cold.Never again."

I actually liked the energy but there is a shelf area behind the counter that's visible to patrons, and it could really use a cleaning.. it kinda was ODee dirty in that area, and pretty junky looking to be honest.. lol.  They should straighten that up for real though.FoodThe fish was a tad oily and wasn't seasoned as well as I would have liked. But it wasn't bad. It was just ok. I think the fish at the other place is better.The joloff rice was great though! It had the mutton pieces in it which gave it a great flavor. I dunno what the other guy was talking about.. it does taste different from other joloff but I enjoyed it. maybe the person who didn't like it came on an off day.. PriceThis is so affordable for what it it is. Can't go wrong. Portions are HUGE and you get your money's worth. Would I go back? For take out joloff sure!"

I explained to him that I have kids and I can't leave my apartment and he replied that he is not coming into the building that I need to come outside. He was very rude and nasty to me. I will never order from here again and I will be sure to let everyone know about these people. By the way I never got my food No one trued to rectify the situation.

443,EXtAG3Yi3vfRHA0XWyKlyA,5/13/2010,5 star rating,"A line of taxi cabs forms a fortress in front of New Ivoire, a line that stretches down the block and gets even larger as day turns to night and midnight hungers need to be fixed. This 24-hour joint is obviously popular with the West African cab drivers in the city, and I would definitely rather see them sitting here having friendly conversations instead of avoiding them on the street while biking.They sat around large tables alternating their attention between the food, the rambunctious conversations, and the soccer channel on television. The owner would sit with them at times, giving the place a very friendly local feel. As newcomers we did not stand out at all though, even if my spotty French was not quite enough at times to describe what I wanted.At lunch, the restaurant has a rotating menu of three or more items, different on each day. The following two items were available on Mondays. The sauce arachide ($10) was very similar to other West African mafes, but had a more subtle approach to its peanut sauce, allowing other flavors to surface and creating a splendid soup for its beef. Served with a heaping plate of rice, the dish is definitely more than necessary for lunch.Another choice for the sides was a plate of yuca that appeared in couscous form. The owner recommended it with the second dish, the sauce Claire dindon ($10), and was spot on. It's a soup with turkey and tomato, but spiced with pepper and very oily. Both dishes brought back great West African memories with a small colorful pepper in the center.I also grabbed what appeared to be a homemade lemonade ($2), and expected it to be infused with something sickeningly sweet like vanilla. What I found though was in addition to this insulting sweetness a strong burning ginger was in there, which I could not finish despite the great taste."

If you're like me and you live for authentic ""ethnic"" food (the more obscure, the better), New Ivoire will be a dream come true. It's raw, bare bones and populated with honest-to-goodness West Africans (Ivorians?) speaking honest-to-goodness West African French. I felt like I was actually in the Cote d'Ivoire, minus the shaky political landscape. It was divine.The staff are friendly and welcoming, chatting easily in their native French with the locals/regulars, then switching to English for ""outsiders"" like me (though I actually do speak French, haha). No one bothers you, no one rushes you, food comes fast and fresh. And the food! We got the Attieke with a (free) side of spicy fish sauce to share and wow! It was so many things I love in food. Light, fluffy couscous mixed with tangy, zesty marinated vegetables. A bizarre little spice cube that melted nowhere near as fast as it should and the fish sauce combined to make an incredibly savory dish, the likes of which I have never tasted, and I've had a lot of West African cuisine.If you're not afraid to venture up to Harlem (and seriously, why would you be?), you MUST come here. Harlem offers a lot of West African cuisine, mostly Senegalese, but as far as I know, this is the only Ivory Coast restaurant in the city (or vicinity of the U.S. of A).

I have to say I was a bit disappointed. We got to New Ivorie around 7:30 saturday night, we walked in assuming a waitress will great and seat you- not so much. My boyfriend ask the lady at the cash register, ""Where can we seat""?She responded in french.. ""Yeah, whatever"". Leaving us to seat at the only vacant table that was wasn't clean. While waiting for someone to take our order, we noticed the menu's in a pocket attached to the side of the table. Though, knowing what I already wanted, I grabbed a menu that was dirty and sticky - eww. After about 10 minutes looking around, a man came to take our order. The usual for us, poisson braise, aloko and salad. Luckily, our order didn't take no more than 10 minutes to come out.  I was EXTREMELY disappointed. It was the smallest tilapia fish ever. The onion slaw on top was disappointing as well, small proportioned, dry and not much flavor. The aloko ( sweet fried plantains) were dry and flavorless also. The salad was pretty boring, the vinaigrette was one note. I did like the side mayo and hot sauce.. thank goodness for that! My bf did like the music after they got it to work. Bob Marley's greatest hits how could you go wrong.Overall, I don't ever plan on going back and I wouldn't recommend it. I've experienced far better. $16 for a tiny fish. No way! Looking for great west african food..Try -  La Save, African Kine or even Patisserie Des Ambassades"

This burger is hefty and very delicious. The patty is perfectly marinated and they include jalapeño peppers on the side which pairs perfectly with this burger. The picture on the menu is exactly what it looks like. You can add a cup of coffee for a dollar as a set meal.

You might also get distracted by the tacky vape store with the parking lot, which I recall being a deli when I was growing up.Koryodang is a much humbler bakery chain in NY, and first opened on Union St. when I was a kid by a photo store (remember those?). They're not as fancy as the bigger ones that came to the states, such as Paris Baguette, but Koryodang has a couple of staples that they've always done right - the croquette, their cream/custard bread, and their family sized breads (such as the butter one). This small Koryodang doesn't have all my old favorites, including some of the more savory croquettes, but what they have still hits the spot. The staff has always been friendly and the bakery feels very small town, which rates high in my book - especially in the morning or a quiet weekend when you don't want to start the day with a mean shot of some nasty sass.The younger part-timers seem to rotate a lot, so there might be hiccups here and there, but I think that adds to the charm. Only time I somewhat get annoyed is when they sometimes forget to apply my family life card to my order, but it is what it is.Anyway, this is a tough spot, and I'm glad they're still around. This is especially true when I'm craving for some bbang within walking distance! I'm still secretly hoping they'll change up their menus sometime and bring back their potato/beef and curry croquettes, but they're doing just fine either way.Update: Woah weird, I went in today and noticed they now have potato curry croquettes! It's a bit like their other one, but curry flavored."

The BLT was good but what blew me away was the sauce! It tasted like sweet Mayo or something similar to the sauce for honey walnut shrimp! I took off a star because the cashier did not have the nicest attitude towards me. I don't know if it's because I'm not Korean or what but she was friendly speaking to the other Korean customers so.. sandwich was good though :)

Hookah was also very abrasive and bartenders were quick to drop an attitude if we didn't pay for every single drink right away. How about you put it all on one tab instead of giving me 40 receipts?

And I was beyond disappointed. We made a reservation on open tables. Upon arrival the ambiance and music was inviting. After being seated we waited 15 min for our waitress to tend to us. Keep in mind the venue was empty and there was no reason for the excessive wait. The mixed drinks were delicious and well priced. The hookah was also good. Now the food was not it. The food was plated well but the taste was not desirable. The food menu states the vibe is Latin fusion. The ""Latin dishes"" were not consistent they don't know what part of Latin America they represent. The Asian dish I had taste like a basic Chinese food item with gold flakes I paid for which were not worth the extra 10 spent. When the bill came  it was more than expected given the 5 star bill for appetizers . Honestly would only come here for the well crafted drinks & hookah.

468,jjBcUeE4-Z8VoGFaYkdxvw,4/20/2016,1 star rating,"Most of my night there was... ok. A ""mandatory"" $3 coat check which bothered me a bit but was no big deal... Music was solid, drinks were overpriced but fair, and the service was good. The checkout is what infuriated me. I asked for the bill and was handed a folder, a pen, and was told ""thank you very much"" by a young male bartender. I expected a bill of about $60, so I was surprised to see a total of $76. As I was about to tip my normal 20% and bring the tab up to $90, I decided to look at the itemized bill to see if my gut was right. Sure enough it was. Included in the $59 tab for TWO PEOPLE was a ""20% Tips"" charge. Had I drank another 2-3 drinks I would not have noticed, and would have tipped 40-50% total.Yes, yes... I know that some late night clubs do this on every bill. What infuriated me is that the bartender did NOT tell me ""Hey, just wanted to let you know, we included a tip on your card."" Every other time I had a pre-charged tip, I was either told when I opened, or when I closed my tab that I was going to be charged. If you are going to charge a tip, have some DECENCY and tell the customer. If you are NOT going to tell the customer about the pre charged tip (which they did not), it is a slimy move to charge 20% on the card, and then hand him or her a pen with a receipt that prompts for a SECOND tip.To the owners and employees of Tantra, I ask- How many people have you done this to? Serving one bottle after another, drink after drink... Charging 20% on a card without telling them, and then smiling in their face and saying ""Thank you!"" as you prompt them for another tip.I have been partying in bars in clubs in NYC for 15 years and have never seen anything like this. As dishonest a move as I have ever seen."

We might have stepped on the wrong place but a nice warning or something might be better. She was just so aggressive while we just wanted to order drink. Well not for us then. No more coming back. Money spent elsewhere. Nyc is full of good bars. Ps: the host was the girl with tied hair. Well she said dont stand on my face but well nobody did. We did not care about her just wanted to order drink and spend more. But well they dont want more money that s their problem.Early morning 7/31/22 incase the manager wants to talk to her.Or maybe because we are asian. Which is even worse. Bye bye. No more money spending there.

The parking space is super small, good thing they have valet service there. Interior was 7 out of 10/ a regular nothing special diner. The menu variety is decent, nothing crazy. Hostess wasn't the best one I've met: no smile, no welcome greeting, but whatever. Ordered New York and Rib eye steaks on the bone on sizzling plate  and merlot They serve pickles , pita and cabbage salad as appetizer before food comes. Steaks arrived in a huge skillet with mushrooms and onions  and smelled amazing. I have to say- it's very very good steak they serve. Definitely worth of trying it. I think the secret is in their marinade and that the meat is kosher and fresh. Will go there again!"
483,3Bjnre3_kCgGR8n7cpL8nA,8/10/2018,3 star rating,The food at hapisgah is very good. It's my favorite kosher steakhouse. That being said the service sucks. Everytime I come here it takes ages to get the waiters attention and they all seam overworked and uninterested. They are also very slow.  It's unfortunate because I would give 5 stars if the service was better. My recommendation here is simple get the house steak I get the extra large medium rare. Also get the sizzling plate of mushrooms and onions. If you're looking for a soup get the kibbeh soup.I understand it a busy restaurant but for GD sake train your staff better and get ppl who are more enthusiastic and friendly.

486,3Bjnre3_kCgGR8n7cpL8nA,8/22/2020,1 star rating,"Do not go here if you care about your well being and don't want to get coronavirus. THE OWNER of the restaurant refuses to wear a mask. He walks in and out of the restaurant, visits the kitchen, rearranges tables, and take orders from patrons outside. He also allows others inside his restaurant who aren't wearing the state mandated masks. While we were sitting there, we watched as a woman in a wheelchair who was at least 80+ years old and not wearing a mask was pushed into the restaurant. Perhaps most alarming, the same owner was vaping inside of the restaurant, effectively blowing his germs all over the restaurant where food was actively being carried through to get to customers outside. The entire time, the owner was either letting his friends or just other customers who were also not wearing masks into the restaurant, and the hostess checking people in was barely wearing a mask--her entire nose was exposed. I can't even count the number of health and safety violations I was exposed to while eating here. This place should be shut down by the city. I genuinely felt at risk eating here so I can only imagine how someone who was immunocompromised would feel.

To top it off with nice semi-dry red wine. Overall the place was really nice, not laud, has a parking lot. It's a new go to place, will definitely be back."
488,3Bjnre3_kCgGR8n7cpL8nA,8/23/2017,1 star rating,"Let me explain the 1 StarFirst I'll tell you that this steakhouse has declined from what it used to be.  Second The chefs/management/and wait staff has changed (for the worse) Third They do NOT know how to serve customers. General: Some of the food is good, the rest is mediocre and in no means would I consider this a ""Steakhouse"" They don't serve heart portions.  For example we ordered 3 different dishes, baby chicken kabob and beef kabob.  The chicken had flavor/the beef did not The aides on each plate were embarrassing. Rosemary potatoes were 3 half inch potato slices.  Not even half a potato and they don't use big potatoes. Salad was just some chopped lettuce and tomatoes.  No onions no dressing, I made them take it back, I'm not paying $19 for 4 dollars worth of food. I counted EXACTLY 13 French fries, the reason I counted is because I could see the plate right thru the fries. The best thing we had all night was the hummus which is phenomenal and that's about it.   The dessert was as cheap and low end as you can imagine.  I've had large ice cream and it does NOT taste like that.  Was a big ball of white frozen water.  The waiter was ""ok"" he never acknowledged any of our orders or gave us confirmation that he heard anything we asked for or said. Yet he brought it all. The crowd are extremely demanding religious ashkenz type Jews which the wait staff can be heard speaking to with frustration so I get their attitude but don't give it to me if your fed up with the table to my left.  I would go their (if ever again) strictly for water refills and hummus. Everything else can be made at home for much better.  If you know food, this place is a waste of time and money, don't let the reservation line fool you because it's the only kosher steakhouse"" within 10 miles."

I was here with a group of friends and the security guard accosted us, grabbing our drinks out of our hands and saying ""get the fuck out of my bar"" because he was insisting we were sitting on the pool table. The pool table is located in the center of the bar so the entire crowded bar is pushed up against it. Yes, people are leaning on the pool table but no one was being remotely disrespectful in any way of the property. It's a bar in the LES. It's crowded. But the whole thing was startlingly out of the blue. Everything was fine and then this guy was screaming at us.  Really sorry, but as an adult who has paid for a drink, you don't get to yank it out of our hands like an unruly child. We were a small group of chill mid 30-somethings, not a big group of drunk college bros. He also got physical with a woman friend of mine who is of color and asked her ""can you even read?"" while pointing at the sign saying ""No drinks on the pool table."" Really not looking to feel physically assaulted when we go out for a drink.After multiple attempts to apologize for the misunderstanding and attempts to reason with the security guard, he literally slammed the door in our face in this really dramatic display. We couldn't believe how personal this guy made the whole thing. Really not a good look, Cherry Lounge. Can you train your security team that this isn't some extension of their masculinity that they need to ""protect,"" and yanking drinks out of your customers hands is treading on rough territory."

However today I am giving the deli 3 stars. The reason being I ordered turkey and cheese with lettuce Mayo and tomato on wheat bread. Asked for some vinegar. When I went to open my sandwich the bread was sopping wet from the vinegar. This is the 1st time it has happened because this is one of my go to sandwiches and it never comes out like that. In the deli's defense it wasn't the usual person behind the deli preparing the sandwich today. That could have a been a reason. However I know it's wheat bread and it's not as durable as a roll or hero but cmon really? The bread was drenched I had to throw the bread away. It literally looked like the vinegar was poured on top of the entire sandwich. Please be more mindful next time. I was really looking forward to eating it"

First off, just to make sure that the distance was not too far, I have these folks a call. Whoever picked up the phone sounded like the sweetest person, ever. I mean usually you call a new place for the first time's, you feel like you're bothering someone. Totally opposite case, here. The food came, and quick sidebar, my mom's apartment is in a complex. If you are not the sharpest tool, you will call and you will get lost. Their delivery person came right to the door and seemed just as sweet as the young lady on the phone. Not only did it come earlier than expected, but it was EXACTLY as I ordered. This current quarantine is annoying, but it seems like most places who deliver just can't read. These guys read my special request, BAR FOR BAR. You guys who read my reviews know that I do not like giving 5 stars lightly.

Love the self service soda machine that has so many drink choices you might do some mixing as I did . The place has plenty of space to order at the front counter as the tables have been removed as its order and go until whenever. Overall the wings are good and good amount of chicken and less bones is always a plus . For someone who loves , likes and tolerates wings , this place gets my approval."

Ashley was very friendly and reminded me due to online orders to prevent fraud (which happens a lot more during covid times) I had to show my ID. *Makes sense*Thanks for working during these covid times and thanks Wingstop for my amazing meal.

They have a pretty nice selection of sides & different sauces for the wings. I had the mild buffalo & the parmesan & garlic. Both very tasty but I felt like they could both use some more sauces. They are very generous with their fries and the vegetable sticks ( carrots & celery ) which are very fresh by the way. They serve pretty cold beers & have a large selection of fountain drinks. Nice location as well with plenty of tables and seating, just good luck finding parking!"

We order a family pack that comes with three different flavors (Spicy Korean Q, Hickory smoked BBQ and Lemon Pepper). It also comes with three sauces, fries and veggies sticks.My reason to this review is because there were no water cups available to their customers.I found this quite ridiculous because water should be free and whether there are no more cups, they should accommodate their customers. After explaining my reasoning, I was offered a cup from the manager which was charged originally $4.Aside from that.. the wings were AMAZING! Highly recommend. Just make sure to bring your water bottle or a cup."

The falafel is what makes the plate and if they're bad I can't enjoy the rest of the sides, no matter how good (and they were pretty good). Oddly, the rice was the star; it has such a unique, almost sweet, blend of spices.The cauliflower was not worth the extra money spent on getting a third side. It's not that great. The beet and red cabbage salad that comes on the plate as well as the hummus are all tasty. You get a pita, which I always appreciate, but I wish I could have gotten whole wheat. I was also disappointed they didn't have babaghanoush when I went. How could they run out?!This place has so much potential... It's open late and there's plenty of seating. There are a ton of vegan options and they have a great variety of menu choices. The workers are nice and were helpful when I asked questions. Yet, with falafels that are spicier than any of the ones I've had in NYC, I simply can't trust anything else and will probably not return."

The food is fresh. I had a red lentil soup (so good I drink it like juice (I'll grow up next year)) and falafel quesadilla. They're so nice they let me create that myself. And it was good! They're cheap with prices but not with portions. My food can always last two sessions. The quesadillas came with beans, salad, and rice. All for $7/$9 can't remember but I think it's $7. Simply put, you need messy food late night or even early morning come here so you don't have to break your pocket and it can last. OH, VEGAN OPTIONS AVAILABLE.

For bread/appetizer, we chose the mini baguette sandwich (baguette with cheese and ham) and tuna brioche. For food, we chose one of each option offered (caprese salad and salmon w/ quinoa). For drinks, we chose the lemonade (other option is a mini evian water). For dessert, we chose one of each option offered (chocolate eclair and a seasonal baked cherry dessert). With taxes, the basket was $70. I would say it was cute and definitely a nice experience that is offered. The park is only an avenue or two away so I would say this can be bought and brought for a cute date or outing!"

Will go again if I am in the area.
556,pTv4RDll3N_CGG3BwtEctg,10/3/2022,3 star rating,"At first sight  Cafe Bilboquet looks like a first class alternative to Starbucks but my experience was Dunkin Donuts.  Admittedly their desserts look gorgeous, works of edible art but if you are looking for well made espresso beverage and a savory bite to eat with it you will be disappointed.  First of all espresso drinks are served in paper cups exclusively, no mugs available for sit down.  Even Starbucks offers mugs upon request.  Even more low class is that there are not even paper or plastic plates or utensils to eat the food you just paid more than double than anywhere else. Grab a few tiny cocktail napkins and dine on your take out bag. I ordered a large Latte and observed that only one shot was used. Again, anywhere else two shots are standard for large drinks.  I also ordered a ham and cheese croissant and when I asked for it to be warmed it was put in a press for a minute squashing it like a Panini, and even then it was cold on the inside.I get it that they're off Madison in an extremely upscale neighborhood but for the prices they charge the experience was way under par."

It's one of the best coffee I've ever had and that says a lot with all the coffee shops in NYC alone. The barista prepared it really well with a sense of artistry. Coffee in general is overpriced in the city so I wish it wasn't so expensive to buy this on a daily basis.The vibe is pretty chill and not pretentious. It seems like older folks who are professors come and grade class papers here.

570,pTv4RDll3N_CGG3BwtEctg,2/27/2023,5 star rating,"Cute and casual Malaysian restaurant in the LES. You order at the counter, find your own seat, and they bring the food out to you when it's ready. We came around 11:30 on a Sunday and waited around 15 mins to order, even though there weren't too many people in line ahead of us. Most of the seating was taken, but we grabbed two seats at a shared table. We ordered the kaya toast, nasi lemak, tok tok mee, and Penang-style muah chee. Kaya toast (4/5)Bread was a bit hard and didn't feel like it was freshly toasted, but I loved the pandan coconut flavor paired with the lightly salted butter. Nasi lemak (5/5)Anchovies and peanuts were really flavor, and paired well with the coconut rice. Tok Tok mee (5/5)This one was definitely my favorite. The egg noodles had such a great bouncy texture, and the sauce/broth was so savory. The char siu was really delicious as well, and had a great caramelized flavor. I do wish the portion was larger though. Wontons were super crispy, but got a little soggy from the sauce at the bottom. Muah-chee (5/5)Essentially just pieces of mochi coated in peanuts and sugar, but it came out fresh and warm and was so delicious. Reminded me a lot of the peanut snowballs you can get at Chinese bakeries. Overall, really solid and relatively inexpensive place to grab a meal. Definitely will be back!"

There are a few small tables inside, counter seats by the window, and long tables with benches. You go up to the counter and order, then the staff will bring you your items if you dine in. Some of the best items to order include:- Kaya Butter Toast: The toast is fully loaded with kaya jam, which is delicious! It's not overly sweet and the pandan flavor is really apparent. Definitely suggest getting this, even if it's not breakfast time. - Tok Tok Mee: The option served here is dry, without any broth directly in the dish or on the side. The combination of cha siu, yao choy, and pork wontons with the dark sauce is very flavorful. The noodles have a nice, slightly chewy texture. - Pan Mee (Soup): Similarly, the texture of the hand-pulled noodles were nice and chewy. The broth is fishy and salty (as expected due to the anchovies). - Lychee Bandung: The drink was very refreshing and served in a little pouch with actual lychees. The rose syrup made the beverage a bit more balanced with floral notes. Don't forget to stir the drink so the syrup mixes properly. However, the Char Kway Teow was a bit lackluster relative to everything else and the chili paste was barely noticeable (the dish reminded me more of a Chinese beef chow fun). Looking forward to coming back again, especially for the Kaya Butter Toast and to have more breakfast items!"
572,pTv4RDll3N_CGG3BwtEctg,2/2/2023,5 star rating,"Kopitiam was so so good and even though there was such a long line to order, ordering actually went by really fast and we got our two Malaysian breakfast dishes in less than 15 minutes.We ordered the - Pandan Kaya Toast ($7): the pandan coconut cream was SO GOOD. Perfectly whipped and fluffy. There was also a smathering of pure butter that I felt was unnecessary but the pandan cream stole the show. The toast was also the Asian milk bread toast- so light and fluffy and toasted on both sides. Reminds me of breakfast in Singapore. - Nasi Lemak ($8.5): the coconut rice here was so savory and so so good with the boiled egg, anchovies, and sambal. The sauce comes with a kick- so if you're sensitive to spice, start small and build up to the total flavor profile!Both dishes were more than reasonable priced for the quantity. They're great if you don't need a full meal and perfect for a bite for breakfast. We were able to find seating inside relatively easy for two but more than that could have been a struggle (although there's some outdoor seating now for bigger parties).Would love to come back for brunch again!"

They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait if you go on a weekend around lunch time. Once seated, you go up to the register order the food. The menu has many options to choose from making it difficult for my friend and I to choose. The prices are fairly cheap for NYC, so we were able to order a lot. The portion sizes are good for one, or for sharing if you order many dishes as well to split. Our top two dishes were the cheong fun and the pineapple chicken jerky buns. These dishes transport you back to Asia as they are so packed with flavor and just hit the spot. However, I thought the buns could have used more meat and less butter. We also ordered the milo toast which was a very large portion. It was the perfect sweet dish to accompany the other savory ones. Their iced drinks come in the cute little plastic bags - good for those taking Yelp or Instagram photos. Overall, a cute and casual place to hang with friends or family."
574,pTv4RDll3N_CGG3BwtEctg,3/27/2023,3 star rating,"I was not a huge fan. I ordered the kaya toast and soft boiled egg.What worked:-- kaya toast was good, soft bread and sweet filling. The butter added a nice touch of saltiness-- quick service-- very good prices. I felt like most things on the menu were really well priced, it was refreshing -- two bathrooms, each one was basically an individual room which I liked because it offered a lot of privacy. Keep in mind that the sink is outside of the bathroom stall-- really unique menu. You can't easily find these dishes in other places What didn't work:-- I didn't realise that the half boiled egg is not the same as a soft boiled egg. This is a matter of personal preference but I definitely did not enjoy the runny egg whites-- I felt like there weren't all that many savory vegetarian options available. There were some but the selection was pretty limited and very few vegan options Overall, I was not a fan but most of the issues I had were due to personal preference."

576,pTv4RDll3N_CGG3BwtEctg,3/11/2023,5 star rating,"The Lower East End of New York City is home to a gem of a restaurant that I simply can't resist every time I'm in the city: Kopitiam. This eatery specializes in Malaysian street food and Nyonya cuisine, which I absolutely adore.My first visit was in April 2022, during a time when Covid protocols were still in place. I opted for takeout and enjoyed a variety of dishes in my hotel room. From the classic nasi lemak to the lesser-known oh chien (Malaysian-style oyster omelette) and Nyonya specialties like loh bak and petai. Each dish was prepared with great care and transported me straight back to Malaysia with its authentic flavors.My second visit fell over Thanksgiving of 2022, and I had to order the Malaysian classic, char koay teow. This stir-fried flat rice noodle dish with Chinese sweet sausage and blood clams is world-renowned, but it's hard to find an eatery that uses blood clams. I was overjoyed to discover that Kopitiam did, and it was a match made in heaven. The belachan wings were another standout item, and the fermented shrimp paste really elevated the dish to another level.My most recent visit to Kopitiam was just two weeks ago when my friend and I spontaneously decided to explore Chinatown. We stumbled upon Kopitiam and decided to give it a go once again. This time, we indulged in the Milo French toast, kaya toast, pulut inti, and of course, oh chien. Every dish was mouthwatering, but we both agreed that the oh chien stole the show. The Milo French toast was a unique and delightful twist on a classic dish, and the Kaya toast came with a generous amount of the custard. I highly recommend checking out Kopitiam's website for their daily rotating specials, like the current feature of assam laksa and chee cheong fun that I'm dying to try. Additionally, their selection of kuih, traditional Nyonya pastries, is just as impressive and delicious. Needless to say, I'm already planning my next visit to Kopitiam!"

Seating was a little difficult to find, but you just need to have a little patience haha. The workers were nice & don't forget to post a picture on ig for a free milk tea :3 I order the Nasi Lemak & it was pretty good! Quite standard, but it was a good amount of food for the price. My friend ordered the Char Kway Teow & we both thought it was worth the wait. It wasn't too salty and had a good amount of meat/shrimp pieces. The chicken jerky sandwich was personally my favorite. It combined my two favorite things, pineapple bun & malaysian jerky  I would definitely come back for this!! The kaya butter toast was mediocre. The toast was too burnt for my liking and the pandan wasn't very flavorful. I also prefer the jam to be a little thicker in consistency. The Bek-Kopi was a little watery and didn't have that pungent coffee taste that I crave for at these restaurants (it sorta tasted like instant white coffee you can buy at the supermarket) Granted, I did order the wrong drink so maybe i'll come back & try the Cham"

The rose syrup made the beverage a bit more balanced with floral notes. Don't forget to stir the drink so the syrup mixes properly. However, the Char Kway Teow was a bit lackluster relative to everything else and the chili paste was barely noticeable (the dish reminded me more of a Chinese beef chow fun). Looking forward to coming back again, especially for the Kaya Butter Toast and to have more breakfast items!"

Perfectly whipped and fluffy. There was also a smathering of pure butter that I felt was unnecessary but the pandan cream stole the show. The toast was also the Asian milk bread toast- so light and fluffy and toasted on both sides. Reminds me of breakfast in Singapore. - Nasi Lemak ($8.5): the coconut rice here was so savory and so so good with the boiled egg, anchovies, and sambal. The sauce comes with a kick- so if you're sensitive to spice, start small and build up to the total flavor profile!Both dishes were more than reasonable priced for the quantity. They're great if you don't need a full meal and perfect for a bite for breakfast. We were able to find seating inside relatively easy for two but more than that could have been a struggle (although there's some outdoor seating now for bigger parties).Would love to come back for brunch again!"

They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait if you go on a weekend around lunch time. Once seated, you go up to the register order the food. The menu has many options to choose from making it difficult for my friend and I to choose. The prices are fairly cheap for NYC, so we were able to order a lot. The portion sizes are good for one, or for sharing if you order many dishes as well to split. Our top two dishes were the cheong fun and the pineapple chicken jerky buns. These dishes transport you back to Asia as they are so packed with flavor and just hit the spot. However, I thought the buns could have used more meat and less butter. We also ordered the milo toast which was a very large portion. It was the perfect sweet dish to accompany the other savory ones. Their iced drinks come in the cute little plastic bags - good for those taking Yelp or Instagram photos. Overall, a cute and casual place to hang with friends or family."
584,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,3/27/2023,3 star rating,"I was not a huge fan. I ordered the kaya toast and soft boiled egg.What worked:-- kaya toast was good, soft bread and sweet filling. The butter added a nice touch of saltiness-- quick service-- very good prices. I felt like most things on the menu were really well priced, it was refreshing -- two bathrooms, each one was basically an individual room which I liked because it offered a lot of privacy. Keep in mind that the sink is outside of the bathroom stall-- really unique menu. You can't easily find these dishes in other places What didn't work:-- I didn't realise that the half boiled egg is not the same as a soft boiled egg. This is a matter of personal preference but I definitely did not enjoy the runny egg whites-- I felt like there weren't all that many savory vegetarian options available. There were some but the selection was pretty limited and very few vegan options Overall, I was not a fan but most of the issues I had were due to personal preference."

586,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,3/11/2023,5 star rating,"The Lower East End of New York City is home to a gem of a restaurant that I simply can't resist every time I'm in the city: Kopitiam. This eatery specializes in Malaysian street food and Nyonya cuisine, which I absolutely adore.My first visit was in April 2022, during a time when Covid protocols were still in place. I opted for takeout and enjoyed a variety of dishes in my hotel room. From the classic nasi lemak to the lesser-known oh chien (Malaysian-style oyster omelette) and Nyonya specialties like loh bak and petai. Each dish was prepared with great care and transported me straight back to Malaysia with its authentic flavors.My second visit fell over Thanksgiving of 2022, and I had to order the Malaysian classic, char koay teow. This stir-fried flat rice noodle dish with Chinese sweet sausage and blood clams is world-renowned, but it's hard to find an eatery that uses blood clams. I was overjoyed to discover that Kopitiam did, and it was a match made in heaven. The belachan wings were another standout item, and the fermented shrimp paste really elevated the dish to another level.My most recent visit to Kopitiam was just two weeks ago when my friend and I spontaneously decided to explore Chinatown. We stumbled upon Kopitiam and decided to give it a go once again. This time, we indulged in the Milo French toast, kaya toast, pulut inti, and of course, oh chien. Every dish was mouthwatering, but we both agreed that the oh chien stole the show. The Milo French toast was a unique and delightful twist on a classic dish, and the Kaya toast came with a generous amount of the custard. I highly recommend checking out Kopitiam's website for their daily rotating specials, like the current feature of assam laksa and chee cheong fun that I'm dying to try. Additionally, their selection of kuih, traditional Nyonya pastries, is just as impressive and delicious. Needless to say, I'm already planning my next visit to Kopitiam!"

A lot of good malaysian restaurants closed down during the lockdown... so I was on a hunt for a new favorite. It was quite packed when I came on sunday, around 6pm. Seating was a little difficult to find, but you just need to have a little patience haha. The workers were nice & don't forget to post a picture on ig for a free milk tea :3 I order the Nasi Lemak & it was pretty good! Quite standard, but it was a good amount of food for the price. My friend ordered the Char Kway Teow & we both thought it was worth the wait. It wasn't too salty and had a good amount of meat/shrimp pieces. The chicken jerky sandwich was personally my favorite. It combined my two favorite things, pineapple bun & malaysian jerky  I would definitely come back for this!! The kaya butter toast was mediocre. The toast was too burnt for my liking and the pandan wasn't very flavorful. I also prefer the jam to be a little thicker in consistency. The Bek-Kopi was a little watery and didn't have that pungent coffee taste that I crave for at these restaurants (it sorta tasted like instant white coffee you can buy at the supermarket) Granted, I did order the wrong drink so maybe i'll come back & try the Cham"

The cole slaw was not good and came in a small container, very sour. We chose wildflower honey (fried chicken sauce) which I recommend! Individual side: The sweet potato fries were not crispy. My order was for pick up and it was missing my sweet potato fries. I called and the staff said ""unfortunately there's nothing I can do."" Did not offer any alternatives or suggestions... In the end, I said I'll go back to get it, since I paid for it... Total was ~ $45. The buffalo Mac and cheese bowl was disappointing.

Service is relatively quick but you also have the option to order ahead so you can avoid panicking at the register when deciding between the many mouth watering options they offer.

I did say ask for sauce on the side but he wanted to taste it as it was served.  Bowls are about $15.  Good for 1 1/2 servings for them so not bad.  I really wanted my mexican rice and beans but also wanted to taste the fried chicken here. It is good that there's an option to buy chicken by-the-piece since I don't really want fries, which combos usually come with.  I got a breast for about $6, which went well with my rice and beans, and the homestyle biscuit for $1.75. I liked the chicken a lot. Very tasty and not salty, not oily. Biscuit was dry - needed the butter and was actually good with the honey it came with - will skip it."

Very basic and dry... maybe skip on that and stick to the fries or mashed potatoes (which I didn't try BUT who can go wrong with potatoes, fried or mashed)."

(Sorry I forgot to provide the visuals for that ‍). Everything I tried was decent: teriyaki chicken, shrimp fried rice, bass... I went to the lunch buffet during midweek. It was crowded, most likely because of a 50% off promotion that ends today (1/19). I imagine there will be still be heavy traffic, around lunch, when there's not the promotion. Similar to its competitor, Olympia which is nearby. Both restaurants near Grand Central and the United Nations. I'd be careful, however. The food is weighed and it can get expensive quickly. My light lunch cost nearly $13 before the discount. Which, can be okay here and there but if you're looking for a consistent lunch spot, this may not be the place for you."

Not La Colombe type of good but enough for a quick grab-n-go sort. Seems to be a great add into the east side of town as there aren't that many of deli choices.

I especially love its high ceiling windows through which I get to see pedestrians walking by while enjoying my coffee inside of the kitchen. There are a variety of choices for food if you come here for lunch. In addition, the food is priced fairly reasonably compared to that of a lot of other restaurants in Midtown East. All the food tastes extremely fresh and delicious, with special shout out to their sliced beef in the hot food section- super tender and flavorful- and freshly made purple rice sushi!

Their food containers are rather bulky and when I asked the girl if she was using the Tare deduction for the weight of our two containers she was clueless about it.  I explained that the law in NYC required her to deduct the weight of the container prior to weighing my food and she was starting the scale at zero instead.  Also I had two different size containers and the law sets a different deduction rate for the large container than the small and she weighed them both and charged me at the same time.  Her response, I'll ask my manager later if I'm supposed to deduct anything for containers didn't help us at all and is basically a $300 fine for first offender and $600 for second time offenders so I think MONA needs to train their employees.  If we do go in again I won't be so easy and will report to consumer affairs."

I was the most important patron there, since I arrived early, and was the only diner! After a quick, friendly greeting, I selected a seat at the sushi bar. After reviewing their lunch specials, I selected the Sushi Bento Box, which comes with 4 pieces of Sushi, an 8-piece California Roll, 2 Japanese Shumai, Edamame, and a side salad or miso soup. I was dubious how this meal would be, as the total cost was only $12!The salad arrived immediately, and the Bento Box in about ten minutes. Candidly, I thought it was great. The Sushi was fresh, as was the salad. The dressing was tasty (next time I will get it on the side). The California roll is a smaller radius than typical, making it easier to eat. It was very tasty, and the edamame tasted freshly cooked. The service was excellent throughout the meal, and I was asked twice if it was to my liking, and if I wanted anything else. The traditional décor, and dark wood ambience is very pleasant. This was a great lunch, and an excellent value. I look forward to a repeat visit!"

We spy a very peaceful looking Buddha in a handsome Asian Bistro and double check with Yelp to see if the place is worth our time. Brooklyn CM, Peter D's, facetiously misogynistic review seals the deal with the words ""fresh and tasty"" and I am glad it did because we were treated to some really good sushi.The menu is extensive here, but we decide on sashimi and sushi to share. They had a sashimi special that was really fantastic - the fish was nicely cut (read NOT thick squarish slabs) to accentuate the fish texture and flavor with interesting ingredients complimenting the fish. It was a very promising start.We ordered an assortment of rolls to share. All the maki rolls had generous amounts of fish I really enjoyed the freshness from here - Toro Scallion, Yellowtail scallion and Salmon avocado was all excellent. There was no issue in ordering a custom naruto style rolls with tuna, yellowtail, salmon and avocado - the slightly sweet ponzu sauce was really good. We also ordered a Black Angel roll off the specials menu and it was very good with shrimp tempura, kani, mango and avocado. We finished off our meal with a shared green tea ice cream that was velvety smooth with subtle green tea flavor. The space was very peaceful and I liked the decor very much - the banquet along the side makes for comfortable seating. A nice solid marble sushi bar is on the other side and a large Buddha statue overlooks all with muzak renditions of classic music - it was a nice calming vibe to help bring 2016 to an end."

You have the option the choose. soup, salad or spring roll with the order, so I chose the veggie soup and spring roll. Sadly enough the spring roll was wet in the bag due to the soup...otherwise it was your typical Asian spring roll with just the right amount of salt. The veggie soup had all sorts of random veggies in it, ranging from cabbage, carrot, broccoli and Chinese spinach. Now to the spotlight, the drunken lo mein had the right amount of spice and flavor, also there were many parts charred, which to me is great cause you know there's enough ""wok hei"" which is a good thing. The red curry had a really nice fragrance but could've been slightly spicier. But overall deserves the praise. I chose pork with the curry and the pork had a perfect fat to meat ratio and the meat was so tender. For $28 for two orders plus taxes fees and tip, it's not bad. I'll be ordering again."

The papaya salad lacked a bit of flavor, acknowledging that we requested not spicy but it was just ok. I think the problem was the service. The waitress had such an attitude she literally rolled her eyes when I asked for a bit of more time. Trust that I noticed the eye roll since wearing masks I focus on the eyes everywhere and this just turned us off. Service influences how you feel and how you feel while you are eating and it was just ok. So for ok Thai it's fine."

The gnocchi was delicious - well cooked and the cheese was very good! The cake was so rich, I really appreciated the texture and flavor! Price: for an Italian place, I thought it was reasonable. The pasta dishes were about $20 for a big portion size (you will be full) and the cakes were able $10, which feels expensive but really requires 3 people to eat it! Ambience: this place has a great vibe to it! I ended up sitting in the outdoor space to stay safe because of covid but honestly the inside area seems so amazing! It feels like a very cozy yet upscale wine bar, which is hard to come by in Astoria, so I was happy with that! Covid safety: they have our door seating with heat lamps!"

Unfortunately, I ordered the medium charcuterie board for $19. It had 6 slices of salami and 6 small pieces of cheese. The meats and cheese tasted like boars head deli products. There were no pieces of bread, or jams/honey. I wish I had taken a picture of the plate. I was absolutely starving, so I ate it, and didn't feel comfortable telling our server that it was an unacceptable dish (especially after I cleaned the plate.) I would still recommend this spot for drinks, but I would most definitely skip the food."

646,U8Ljrx-w5otdMZNFhw5piw,1/7/2019,3 star rating,"3.5 stars My parents did not care for the Chinese fast food items I brought over to their house. My parents prefer authentic Chinese since the taste and quality is basically incomparable. I didn't really buy it for them, it was for the two of us but obviously I wanted my father to try a lil of everything. The options for Cantonese food is pretty slim in Elmhurst so I wanted them to get an idea what fast food Chinese tastes like. This place had great reviews and the huge discount on Seamless really tempted us to try them out. Chicken with eggplant in garlic sauce. Lil spicy, savory. I enjoyed it but my father complained about the eggplant skin being slightly too thick. I had no issues whatsoever. Beef stew.. not the traditional Cantonese style. Had tomatoes and mushrooms. The beef was extremely lean which my father once again complained but this is Chinese fast food. So I don't expect them to put fat and tendons in it. Salt and pepper squid. Perhaps I should not have ordered this at a fast food place since everyone preferred the one at S.W. Not the freshest squid and definitely not fried well. Was very soggy. Was ok but not something I'd order again. General Tso's chicken. Better than the average take out places, but not the best I've had. I liked that it wasn't drowned in sauce. Beef and broccoli. Tasty, but a ton of broccoli... more beef would've been nice.Shrimp with Honey Walnut. L enjoyed it but seriously this needs to be eaten ASAP. By the time I tried it, it was cold and very dry. So I can't exactly blame them since it sat on the table for a while. Crispy shredded beef. My mom was joking that it looked like beef jerky but seriously it was really tasty. Sadly she could not try it since she can't have beef. It's very similar to authentic orange beef but without the orange peel flavor and it's not covered in Portion was a bit small since they add lettuce on the bottom. My parents threw out the Wonton soup since it looked and tasted nothing like the real thing. If this place was near my house... I'd definitely give it a 4 since there are no decent Chinese fast food places near me but it's located in Elmhurst so leans toward 3.5. I suggest sticking with the Americanized dishes since that's what it seems like they're good at. Staff are not as unfriendly like other fast food places. They have an open kitchen so the place is definitely cleaner than the average Chinese restaurant which is a big plus. Afterwards, my father said the prices are pretty affordable and the food wasn't bad, just can't compare it to the real thing."
647,U8Ljrx-w5otdMZNFhw5piw,1/12/2019,5 star rating,"After coming to NYC for vacation, I think this restaurant was the most affordable and worth it place to eat. The food there is super cheaper that can make you full. In the evening time, the place gets really busy but the food comes out fast. You can order your food through their website or call. I would prefer call. I spent a little bit less than $10. I ordered Roasted Pork Chow Fun and Wonton Soup. It was delicious!"

652,U8Ljrx-w5otdMZNFhw5piw,1/3/2017,4 star rating,"I order from here all the time and they are always super prompt and polite with their deliveries. I like that this place has more traditional Chinese dishes, like egg and tomato, as well as egg with bitter melon, along with the usual takeout fare. I actually prefer the more traditional dishes to the usual fare here, but I suppose that that is what sets this place apart from other Chinese takeout places in the area."
653,U8Ljrx-w5otdMZNFhw5piw,6/1/2018,5 star rating,Great Chinese takeout place. It's near where I live and the staff there are all really nice. They remember me and often ask me how my life is going which is pleasantly genuine. The food is great for Chinese takeout food as it just tastes better compared to other places and is typically less oily. It doesn't make me feel horrible after eating and I usually get the beef with broccoli and chicken wings. Their fried rice is good too with the roast pork bits. Service is fast and they always add a lot of sauces and fortune cookies.

We ordered slices of pepperoni and BBQ chicken pizza. Both were fantastic with great flavor and a nice crisp crunch on the bottom.Really clean restaurant and friendly service give this a solid 5 stars.
656,HzmjJ1mM0WdOHbfYm5mxqw,11/25/2022,5 star rating,"After 2 years of extensively trying out NYC pizza hy the slices- this is HANDS DOWN THE BEST slice I've ever had! Situated close to Time Square, this little gem makes an assortment of pizzas with no anchovies on the base so extremely allergy friendly- but that's not why they rock. It's super beautiful crusty crisp thin slice, served piping hot and has the best ever fresh made tomato sauce with high quality cheese and ingredients. I mean, I'm here a little past 10 am quite unashamed of devouring the multiple slices we got! They are consistent and the garlic knots- beware! It's the garlickiest ever knot, superb but avoid kissing anyone after! No one would pas the knot over this though- buttery fresh garlic knot. Amazing! Love this pizzeria!"

659,HzmjJ1mM0WdOHbfYm5mxqw,7/20/2022,4 star rating,"Carnegie Pizza Ratings: 4/5Food: 4.25/5 - Pizza and donuts are always two of our favorite late night snacks to eat when my boyfriend and I are visiting NYC. I always walk pass Carnegie, and finally had the chance to try it out. The pizza is delicious, and tons of pies to choose from with a variety of toppings and sauces. See the description of the BBQ chicken pizza we got to share. - BBQ Chicken Pizza [GET]: The pizza crust is thin, chewy, yet still very crispy. It almost got a texture like a pita bread. Carnegie is not like others, the pizza is not greasy or heavy at all, instead tasted refreshing and light. The BBQ chicken is tender, juicy, and moist. I like the slight sweetness from the BBQ sauce, which combines nicely with the savory and saltiness from the cheese; it's a great combination. I really enjoyed it. Ambiance: 4/5 - Located right around the corner from Joe's Pizza, and close to most Broadway theaters and Time Square. The interior is pretty narrow and long, bright and clean, and you can see all the pizzas as soon as you walk in from the display containers. There's some tables in the back of the restaurants and some countertops for you to stand and eat. There's menu displaying on the big TV screens above, and I like how the wait is much shorter than Joe's. Price: 3.75/5 - The chicken pizza is $5.50, and got charged $5.99 at the store after tax. A couple days later, my credit card was actually charged $6.25, and no idea what is the extra charge was, but oh well, maybe they charge extra with AMEX credit cards. The pizza is solid, and prices are similar to the famous Joe's pizza down the street. Service: 4/5 - Walking in the store, staffs were welcoming and greeted us when we arrive. There's a good amount of staff working in the kitchen, and they were fast and efficient at heating up those slices. I got the pizza within like 5 minutes after I paid, hot and cheesy. It was great not having to wait for a long line for pizza, and the overall experience was smooth. BLUF: Definitely serving some delicious pizza in NYC. Great crust, fresh ingredients, and light. Even though this might not be a well-known pizza spots in the city, but it was delicious and gets the job done. If you are craving for a late night pizza, but do not want to stay in a long line, give Carnegie a try, a hidden gem in Times Square."

The staff was extremely nice and very gracious, having packed is plates and utensils before we were fully able to request them. They had staff maintaining the cleanliness inside and out, making it inviting as we passed by. The pizza was so delicious (as Chicago pizza folks we almost didn't want to admit this!)! The sauce was so delicious, and made the pizza in a way that an ingredient can make or break things. The mozzarella was scrumptious. The freshness of the basil was a if it had been recently picked from a garden. The crust was perfect. We ate the entire pizza, plus a few garlic knots. Whether you're native to NY OR visiting, this is a good place to stop and grab a slice. Or a full box."
662,HzmjJ1mM0WdOHbfYm5mxqw,12/24/2022,3 star rating,"First time in NYC so I've decided to eat pizza for at least one meal a day. Today was day 1 and Carnegie was the closest to my hotel and the door recommended it over another 1st choice I had. He also recommended that I try the vodka pizza. Even though I was hesitant I'm so glad I did, it was the best of the 3 that I tried. I also tried a fresh piece of pepperoni and a pepperoni and sausage. The vodka was surprisingly the best of the 3. I felt like all of them could've used more sauce. I'm a huge crust lover while this one had good flavor it was hard."
663,HzmjJ1mM0WdOHbfYm5mxqw,4/12/2023,5 star rating,"Decent NYC pizza, price is high but the slices are equivalent to about 2 regular slices. Also there is a surcharge for using a credit card."

Plenty of people inside and a lot of pizzas available. I just wanted a plain cheese slice. Service was great. Bottom line: just real good NY pizza. (Been eating pizza for over 70 years; best pizza is in NY and Italy)- but that's just my opinion). Enjoy!"

My vanilla chai tea, with a shot of  cinnamon dolce,with almond milk extra hot, was on point, could of been hotter, but still delicious.

677,f9xQH4lNAlU9yUYtFPm7sg,12/8/2019,1 star rating,"Mobile ordering is the worst, you can get a drink faster standing in line. They're always running out of everything, like that one time I waited 20 minutes for a blonde flat white, only to find out they ran out of it. Your staff is not very friendly, borderline RUDE. They also ran out of all the croissants and the drinks suck. Also, you might want to consider teaching your employees how to make all the drinks your menu provides instead of saying ""I don't know how to make that. Are you sure that's what you want?"" Um, yes that's what I want!"

After I had ordered, I was waiting for my drink for FIFTEEN minutes. The barista started to make my drink and right before she was going to put the lid on my Frappuccino, she starts to make someone else a sandwich. She even began to brew another coffee. I actually had to ASK another barista (the first one left) to finish it off.I didn't catch her name but I was furious when I left the store. It was all together unprofessional and unsettling.Another thing that negatively caught my attention was that they don't provide a public restroom for customers. Only employees had access to it.Starbucks is a place where people purchase beverages and like to hangout with their friends and/or relatives and the fact that this location doesn't provide a restroom for their customers is very upsetting and creates an uncomfortable environment for everyone."

This Starbucks was a little under par.  I was there during mid-morning so was able to walk right up and order. I had a few questions about the flavor shots available. Actually, not a few questions. One question. I wanted to know what they had. The barista dryly responded ""vanilla"" and stared back at me. That's fine. I like vanilla and my coffee was standard otherwise. No complaints about the quality. I don't need a hug from the barista, but a little enthusiasm or explanation on the lack of product availability would go a long way to me.

685,oZIo2MOmnd_CML1F11N3Vg,12/19/2022,5 star rating,"We had a lovely dinner at Ivan Ramen yesterday. The bartender (brunette with bleached eyebrows) at the counter was a delight, she gave us recommendations and provided great service. We ordered:* Crispy Eggplant ($13)* Yuzu Lemonade ($4)* Ivan Palmer ($4)* Tonkotsu Ramen ($19)* Tokyo Shio Ramen (18)We spent a total of $63.16 - a little pricy but the food was delicious. The fried eggplants had a delicate crispy breading on the outside and had a silk like consistency on the inside. The drinks were tart and refreshing -- some might say they're not sweet at all compared to traditional lemonade and Arnold Palmers. The unsweetened barley tea is very prominent in the Ivan Palmer even when you mix it together but it was very good. It was a nice palate cleanser to cut through the richness of the ramen. I LOVED the broth of the Tonkotsu ramen. It is jam packed flavorful with tender pork and bits of mushroom. Tokyo Shio ramen had a very deep yet ""clean"" tasting broth. The tomato was a nice umami bomb which is an unusual topping but totally worked. Both bowls didn't look like a lot of food but we left feeling stuffed. The only thing we weren't too crazy about was their noodles. They were a bit lackluster and wished they were wavier for texture. Also they only have one dessert on their menu which is their Yuzu Cheesecake. But overall we had satisfying dinner."

Comic-lined walls and invite you into a cozy, quick-to-serve slurp shop, where, spoiler alert, the best thing on the menu isn't the ramen but the fried chicken. Service is quick as staff tries to keep up with the demand Netflix created with their hit show Chef's Table. If I were more of a ramen fan, I might give this 5 stars, but my ceiling for ramen just isn't high enough!"

There's an outdoor dining area that would be great for warm days. The inside looks a lot like an elevated diner with fun murals covering the walls. I loved how our server started with recommendations and popular dishes. We took her advice and ordered the Chicken Paitan, Tonkotsu Ramen and Crispy Eggplant. They were all some of the best food we've had. You can ask for chili oil if you'd like added spice. Portion is generous and filling. Had to try the yuzu cheesecake. On the surface it looks pretty ordinary- no toppings. But it is a rich and solid slice of a classic desert with an understated taste of citrus."

One of the best things there was the service, though. We sat at the bar, and the bartender/server was incredibly friendly, and informative with helping us pick the items that matched our style. He also was kind enough to let us taste various sakes, and was overall a blast to have as part of our experience.Will for sure be back!"

I loved the wall pattern covered in what looked like images that were classic to Japanese pop culture. So cool!Now the food: On first bite, wow we were speechless.  The egg plant and chicken karate appetizers were so bomb. The ramen, wow. And the yuzu cheesecake, chef's kiss!!!  This was the best ramen that we had on our trip, and we went to four places total. Just written this review is making my mouth water lol!Lastly, the service was amazing. Our waitress was so attentive and friendly!! I definitely plan to go back the next time we visit NYC! Thank you Ivan Ramen for a memorable dining experience!!"
692,oZIo2MOmnd_CML1F11N3Vg,9/29/2022,4 star rating,"Very tasty food; atmosphere - okay; overall I enjoyed my dinner but think that this place is overrated. If you ask me, it's hard to mess up ramen. By default - it's delicious, and sure, I greatly enjoyed my bowl of Chicken Paitan, but did it blow my mind? No. I also found the ramen portion a little smaller than I'm used to - not necessarily a bad thing, but FYI.Was also unimpressed by the appetizers: Japanese Fried Chicken, Tobanjan Green Beans, Spicy Kyuri Pickles. So why 4 stars for what reads like such an underwhelming experience? Well, if you're looking for a yummy meal in the area - definitely go, you'll have some good food. BUT if you are on a mission to find NYC's best ramen - don't go out of your way to eat at Ivan's: I think there are plenty of similar or better options throughout the city.Tip: definitely make a reservation and get a table in the room in the back if you can. And for those who prefer outdoor seating - that option is available as well!"

We made a reservation ahead of time and I'm glad we did because the place filled up even on a Monday afternoon. We came here on a suggestion of my friend who saw this place from Chef's Table and from strong recommendations from other friends.Here is what we ordered:For the table- Crispy Eggplant- Coney Island Tofu- Pork Buns- Spicy Kyuri Pickles- XO DaikonMyself- Tokyo ShioAll the appetizers were really savory and delicious. I must admit I did not have high expectations but they well exceeded what I'd expected. The Crispy Eggplant had such a good crisp and the spices to it meshed so well. The Coney Island Tofu was soft but packed a good punch. I was surprised at how good the XO Daikon was. XO sauce usually gives a strong savory front, and it worked well with the daikon neutral flavoring. Pork Buns and the Spicy Pickles were both very tasty. I must say this was quite a lineup of good tasting appetizers. I got the Tokyo Shio which is their signature dish. The broth and noodle were on point and not too salty. The roasted tomato they add in gives it that well placed umami taste in every bite. My friends who got their Chicken paitan really enjoyed it as well. Our service was attentive and on point. Our server Zack was knowledgable and courteous. He gave us a thorough rundown of the differences between the different types of ramen, which I am sure is a common query. Definite big props to him for making our experience that much better! In summary: great food and service; I would be returning here!"

I hate to admit it - we were incredibly underwhelmed by the food. The service was attentive and very kind. The only thing worth noting was the fluffiness of the pork buns. We tried the fried chicken appetizer and it was covered in so much sauce we couldn't finish it and it was very salty. I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen and my husband ate the chicken Paitan - both tasted flat. I've had many types of Ramen, in Japan and many other places, this had absolutely no flavor. The vegetables inside seemed soggy and not fresh. If I could have a do-over, I would not go back here."

They had a variety of cakes showcased in front- rainbow, chocolate, chiffon, yogurt cakes etc. I chose the green tea blueberry chiffon cake and they had it! Was so happy.  My mom and dad loved it since they only had Paris Baguette cakes only one other time and it didn't impress them at all. Lots of airy cream that was super sweet and the the cake was so light and just sweet enough. Good branch to purchase cakes"

707,BYOxFf1eg66kWDK8KOvNeQ,9/22/2021,1 star rating,"I came here a few weeks ago with my friends. The female worker was so rude to me that I decided to make a negative review because of her. I was going to let it go but since my interaction is still on my mind weeks later, I am going to write one. First of all, minimum wage is up now. Secondly, if you are miserable at your job, don't do it. I don't make a lot myself but when I am working I present a friendly personality to my clients no matter how I feel that day. This worker was just totally horrible with a permanent angry face. Terribly, terribly rude. I was cordial and ordered my food anyway but if my friends weren't there I would have just left and taken my business elsewhere. I frequent KFC in many locations in Queens like Flushing and I go to several in the Bronx. I've been a fan of KFC since I was a kid. The workers are always normal and friendly. This one is just terrible. I don't go out to grab food to experience some worker's attitude. Maybe they don't bother to train their workers anymore or something. My friends and I didn't even stay to eat and there was no line. It was just us ordering to pick up. So you can't blame the stress of the job. Sometimes, I wish I were more like a Karen instead of being a docile male. I should have matched her attitude and told her off without a care in the world. But nope. I am polite and I just take on other people's crap. If I ever go to this KFC again and if this same worker is there and she gives me her attitude, I am going to stoop to her level and say something back. But eh, I know I'm never going back there. And it's just my imagination talking because I know I am too polite to ever say anything. Whoever owns this specific KFC restaurant should really look into their workers because you really hired a nasty person. She's an older Hispanic woman but that doesn't really narrow it down (sorry to identify her by race like that but it's the only way I can think of to describe her. I am a POC too if that makes it better). Oh yea, and the chicken isn't very good either. The other KFCs I go to as well as Kennedy and Popeyes are better. This KFC location is just bad in every way, including the food. Maybe I should have led with that."

With plain pizza being the epitome of pizza, it's usually not even ready. I've gone here a few times and have been told I need to wait for more to be made. (Which usually takes roughly ten minutes) I have gotten breadsticks maybe half the times I have ordered the pizza combo. Other times, I am told it can be substituted with biscuits or a cookie or something else from their selection of sides. On top of this, when they do have breadsticks, they're usually overcooked/burnt, or just old. The last time I went, my pizza was not fully cooked, I had to get biscuits instead of breadsticks, and it seemed as if the pizza was cut by someone wearing a blindfold. Two gargantuan slices, one medium, and one miniscule triangle. I don't know why I've given this place so many chances, probably just convenience. But not anymore."

I overheard other gals in my party say they enjoyed their cocktails too: amaretto sour and vodka tonic. If their drinks were like mine, then I'd say cocktails were just sweet enough that you can't taste the alcohol/booze. Delicious. Then, the booze sneaks up on you.Lastly, there a self-serve water dispenser. Single woman's bathroom was clean (on a Wednesday night). There's a working photo booth too."

It's 90's inspired, sprinkled with a few current hits ranging from Janet Jackson,The Fugees, and INOJ to Bruno Mars, Solange and Chance. The main area gets packed so I recommend getting your groove on in the back room.There is a $20 credit card minimum so bring some cash. Or just have your friends venmo you so its easier to meet the minimum. I thought drink prices here are standard in most big cities ($10 for a gin & tonic).Parkside Lounge reminds me of a couple of my favorite hang out spots back home.

Last night we had over 25 members from our chapter and they were very quick with the orders.Parking is available on site. AND for those who still wish to eat in an exterior environment, they have converted part of their parking into an eating area. Enjoy!"

I got the French toast with fresh fruit and it was made to perfection. The pastrami burger was goodA perfect medium (and is an actual burger ) with pastrami on top of itt - make it a deluxe to come with waffle fries and you wont regret it ! We also got the wings with dry rub and they had the perfect crunch . The quesadilla was also delicious and hit the spot . The server was amazing and will definitely be back for late night eats in the area.

The service is not something I start with unless the food falls short but here it was equally impressive to the delicious food served. The happiest group of family type restaurant you will ever experience. The food was the most fresh and delicious tasting that only a happy chef and staff could bring from their hearts to your table. The spices and textures were excellent, everything fresh and served hot hands down everything is an example of what great homemade food should be. This is the best place to eat if your craving home cooking like mama. The menu is extensive but no compromise to quality, the chefs are not tied to a particular type of food they are talented enough to do anything."

We loved the home fries! Also - a bonus that they have a full bar so we were able to have out favorite grapefruit and vodka. Quick and friendly service - I highly recommend this diner!
745,AvpB-RQgEW9N4Eip3l3cww,2/19/2022,5 star rating,"Buccaneer's has been my family's preferred diner for decades. The staff and management have earned our trust through their use of high quality, fresh ingredients in their dishes. If you're the type to order breakfast at ten o'clock at night, this is the place for you. One of my preferred dishes at Buccaneer's is two over-easy eggs with fries and bacon. Let's go through this dish ingredient by ingredient. First off, their eggs are just right, a succulent yolk that screams fresh. There is no flavor profile contamination whatsoever. Simply wonderful.I've had some terrible experiences at other restaurants when ordering fries. They'll serve them soggy, oil-drenched, sometimes even over-fried to the point where the fry is semi-translucent. In an ideal world, a fry is warm (not scalding) when it reaches your mouth, has a soft crunch, and the texture of the potato and the surrounding salt combines to balance the natural blandness of the potato and enhance its own flavor. Buccaneer's fries does exactly that. They truly do set the golden standard for fries. The umami flavors found in the fries is further enhanced by their delectable bacon. Thinly sliced, lightly fried bacon is the perfect accompaniment to any of their meals. It dissolves the minute it touches your mouth resulting in an ecstatic experience.As always, it is worth noting that a restaurant is only as good as it's food and service. Gabriel has been a hard-working employee of the diner for many years and always goes above and beyond to enhance your dining experience. A special recognition to the rest of the staff for their amiable hospitality and care."

If I were boss/manager  I would kick many out because they are not doing what they are told and they keep messing my order.   I ordered from Grub hub and those Jackasses keep changing my address and it went to someone else.  The someone else is a thief, they see the name on the receipt and don't say "" sorry this is not mine.   The idiot driver though may have told the diner he delivered it, just to eat it on his own.  Either way I would have him kicked out.  Its disgusting to make someone wait that long and I had instructions on Grubhub to toast the roll and take the inside out of the bread but the idiot who took the order didn't care just put fried sandwich!!!!    I told the driver, tell the other jerks, when you go to deliver the order, ask for the name.  let them give you the name because they can say yes and take the order.  Despina is only a woman's name but either way make sure they tell you first their name.  Please have one person be tough and they should treat all Greeks always well,  This is a Greek diner and we are proud to treat each other perfectly!!!! if the workers fail to do so when the boss is not around and the boss finds out about it, then the boss should then fire them.   You see how fast they will learn to respect his clients."
747,K6x7wyqA2iOBjWIhMvOBVQ,10/4/2021,4 star rating,Literally the best boba in NYC hands down. They also offer discounts very frequently on the mobile app. I love how their bubbles have their own taste (I heard that they're soaked in brown sugar) and don't taste like plastic. The tea is also brewed on the strong side which is exactly how I like it.My only issue is that the default sweetness of a lot of drinks seems to have gone up recently so it's hard for me to guess what level of sweetness I need to order for myself.Highly Recommended:-Caramel Macchiato with bubbles-Lychee Black Tea-Oolong Milk Tea with Oolong Tea Jelly

Been coming here forever i just ask for less ice and sometimes 75% sugar but i don't mind the sugar. I never taste all the extra powder (like vivis) which is a big nono to me. I usually get winter melon, white melon milk tea, taro (hot/cold), milk tea, lychee, passion fruit green tea i like them all. Fam has gotten coffee and honey lemon too which they like not my fav but honey lemon is very refreshing. Lychee tastes like straight up lychee juice haha love it.

When you come in it's a really small place with about five chairs to sit down and the menu is on the wall and also above the cashier (electronically).  My all time favorite is the passion fruit green tea with tapioca less sugar, less ice. There is a variety of toppings that you can put into your drink. Also you are able to control the amount of sugar and ice you want in it. The other great things you can get here are macaroons and they are amazing! I have never tasted a macaroon as good as these. They have Nutella, Caramel, Pistachio, Strawberry and more. The only one  bad thing about this place is that they only accepting cash, so always come prepared."
751,K6x7wyqA2iOBjWIhMvOBVQ,6/28/2020,3 star rating,"The 3 stars is for the 5 cents they charge for a carryout plastic bag. It's a bit shady enough to want to nickel and dime for a bag, but to point to the NYS plastic bag ban sign on the wall as the reason is a bit sketchy since it doesn't apply here for 2 reasons - 1) restaurants and similar food service establishments are exempt from the ban and 2) the NYS law only allows for charging 5 cents on PAPER bags. Other Kung Fu Tea stores across Queens, Brooklyn, Long Island don't charge (although I think Mott St was before the pandemic). This left a bad taste in the mouth (pun intended) especially given the order for 6 drinks. Anyway, ordering via the app went well and the order was ready before the time stated on the app. Social distancing was also being enforced by having people wait outside after ordering so that's good too."

Dinner menu left less to be desired mainly due to small portions and average execution that mismatched the elevated decor and UES prices. Granted, this is an impression off two dishes: 1. Fish tacos 3/5: fish seemed more tempura- than beer-battered. Small pieces of fish that were chewier than they were crispy. Comes with a sad sliver of lime for 3 small tacos. 2. Chicken enchiladas 4/5: thankfully tender and juicy chicken; pickled onions and (requested to the server) habanero sauce on the side a plus!"

A few popped up but this one was the closest to me.  I go in, It's happy hour and the restaurant/bar is not packed at all. I have a seat and I go to order. I noticed that the happy hour menu is very limited. I ordered Chicken Nachos and a frozen mango margarita. I asked the waiter if I could switch the chicken for steak, but that was not allowed it was just only chicken offered at time. I was a little taken back by how limited the happy hour menu was, and I went on the website to see what their dinner menu look like. And I was impressed so maybe I'll come back here for dinner and see what's up. The nachos were delicious and the drink was on point."

The best part was that the chips were warm as if they were baked homemade. We then ate our entrees of fish taco and chicken fajitas. The fish tacos were nice and crispy and had great sauce to top off! The chicken fajita came out sizzling and also came with sour cream, guacamole, and a medium spiced sauce. We had two great margaritas as well with spicy salt around the rim. Service was great and the team here is very attentive. We look forward to dining here again soon!"

We had the chicken flautas, carnitas tacos, queso fundido with chorizo and tuna ceviche. For drinks we had rosarita and maya margarita both delicious, we also ordered a beer ""Chelada""Which is a traditional Mexican way of having beer, with lime juice and a salt ring and we were surprised or server didn't know what it was, but we explained to him. The size of everything we ordered was small, the tacos too, smaller than regular size tortillas. I would advise to order at least 2-3 dishes per person if you want to try different flavors,  or just go for the regular menu and order a regular dish, at the end price wise it's gonna be the same or even a better deal.Service was good, music, drinks and food was well prepared and everything very tasty. Would probably come back to try their entrees and some other drinks. They also offer unlimited brunch with a variety of drinks and food so this might be our next visit."

So the bring out small selected plates and anything you like you can request more of. The brisket tacos were amazing as well as the Mexican street corn.

Also got the fish tacos, which were pretty bland, but I did like the tortillas"

No....But the sauce and toppings are tasty and it's one of the better places to eat in the mall. Is it the best Italian entrees you'll find in Queens? No....But the sauce is tasty and it's one of the better places to eat in the mall. The only downside about eating here is the price. I just had a slice with tomatoes and onions for $4.34 after tax. It's not cheap by any means. I'll barely give this place 3 stars as generally the food is tasty compared to the other options in the mall...

I kid you not, I've had better from a Campbells can. if I could I wouldn't even give them 1 star, they don't deserve to be in a large community of hungry people. Seriously, don't eat here.

I will say though, that their lunch/dinner menu has an extensive selection to choose from (not saying anything bad about their breakfast menu), so brace yourself.

It just lets you know that the food is good and worth buying. The thing that I don't like is that they are sometimes too slow. I would like to be in and out of this place but that is a never. You go inside, grab a tray., and start to fill up the tray with your desired food. I love their food though. It is very tasty. I usually pack enough for about two days worth of food and it comes out to about $15 a plate. That is not bad.

This is a Jamaican buffet that features a plethora of seafood and hot plates to dine-in or To-Go. Very comparable to the Chinese buffets or a Jamaican version of NYC's Smilers. A colleague introduced this place to me in 2014 when treating me to lunch. Since he's Caribbean, I trusted his judgment. I was shocked to see the large selection of authentic buffet dishes like a ackee and salt fish, fried dumplin, yam, curry chicken/goat etc. I loved that they had the fresh fruit and SEAFOOd as an option. The buffet prices are as expected. You may spend anywhere from $10-$12 on a well portioned container. Be mindful of the weight of your items. Goat, Crab legs, Yam and dumpling can weigh you in very steep. This place is very organized. Southeast Queens, Laurelton in particular, is home to many Jamaicans and Caribbean people, in general so having this buffet here is a gold mine for business owners. They are serving their own people, who will frequent the buffet more than once a week."

I enjoyed everything expect for the rice & the curry chicken. The rice was just not cooked well in my opinion. I'm only able to eat it if I cover it in gravy. The curry chicken didn't have enjoy flavor in it. I've had better. My favorite is the oxtail but they're always running out of it! Which is annoying. I also really like their beef patty, it was light and flaky and the filling was just delicious. Their jerk chicken is also good, it's juicy and flavorful.Their juices looks tasty and refreshing so I want to taste that the next time I come back. I will definitely continue to indulge here!"

The rats that swarm around that restaurant along with the smell blows my mind as I watch people go in a out of that filthy place. If you're ever not feeling well please know it's definitely something you ate. 4/24/18 I CANNOT TAKE IT ANYMORE!!! The level of sexual harassment is rampant at this establishment! I don't even eat there because I see first hand how the food is handled let alone the hissing and kisses as I walk by! It's disgusting! I'm with my child and those men have no regard for respecting women never mind if I was customer. I wanna lodge a serious complaint as the manager failed to address the issues of the bullying going on as I walk by! I've tried to use my earphones to ignore it but I couldn't take anymore as I'm with my child and these males have no manners AT ALL!!!!"

To start, I walked in to a welcoming scent of VOMIT. It was so potent and so harsh, I was considering leaving immediately. (I came inside because the drive through line was very long). Contrary to my better judgement, I get on line and there's a happy hour happening apparently because the counter is filled with pals chatting with employees. During this long amount of time of absolutely no one even acknowledging our presence. One of them looked up at me waiting on the line, but proceeded to exchange Instagram names with a customer.After this, another worker turns and sees us waiting behind all of these friends and says, ""oh sh*t! There are more customers."" After ordering, I hear them say f*ck 5 times. 5!!!!!!!!!!!! Along with MANY other obscenities. One worker even asked one of her friends not to make a mess because she doesn't want to clean it. Is this a joke? I honestly couldn't believe this. It's still not over though. Someone from the back shouted that they needed lettuce (I'm sure to expedite the long line that was building considering the staff at the counter wasn't doing anything) and the girl at the register told him she wouldn't get him lettuce, proceeded by, ""what the f*ck do I look like to you?""You did look like a Wendy's employee, but now you just look like an incompetent human who I cannot believe is still employed. I will absolutely be contacting the corporate office in the morning.***UPDATE - I contacted the corporate office and I got a call back from a giggly, unprofessional manager of the store and tells me, ""they're just kids. They don't know how to act. When you come back, find me and I'll give you a free meal."" First of all, most of the employees were my age and I have never ever acted this way in or out of my job. Second, if your employees ""don't know how to act"" maybe you should consider hiring adults!!!!!! Or more mature (or less trashy) humans!!!!! This was unacceptable. Also, I will never ever ever be returning. Aside from the service, the store was filthy and had a horrid stench. It's a shame that Wendy's still has this store open. Disgusting."

I seen that it had bad reviews, didn't expect it to be great, but I do expect to order my food, get my food in a timely matter, and enjoy my food without attitude, confusing, and being forgotten about. The only reason why I stopped here was because it was close to where I was, and close to the expressway to go my behind home. So I'm waiting online, one person in front of me, woman is asking for coffee, simple right? I don't know why it took 10 minutes for my turn. No hello welcome to Wendy's, just a what do you want, now I have my bitch face on....I start my order, baconator meal, she asks what size drink, I say medium, she automatically starts to make my drink, meanwhile my order is kind of long, next item 10 piece chicken nugget meal, here she goes again stopping my order to make the drink a want with the meal. Now she stops taking my order to make coffee....doesn't know what she is doing, doesn't know how to put the coffee into the filter, doesn't know how to close the top of the coffee pot, I'm standing there thinking this can't be serious. She's finally back to me, I'm confused like where did I leave off??? Okay back to ordering, baked potato with chilli and cheese, she stops again to get someone fries, she stops again to make yet another drink, isn't this suppose to be fast food? Meanwhile I can't seem to get my complete order out in the one minute it usually takes me. Finally my order is done! She puts two kids meals on the plate, I only ordered one, i now have to wait five minutes to get a refund, the fries and chicken nuggets are ready and sitting there, why hasn't she taken them and put them on the tray? My patience is on zero, there is no straws, napkins, ketchup, spoons, available on the service table....so now I have to ask for everything. The entire process was chaos meanwhile the place was empty! I would really hate to see how they handle prime time! Or the location in sheepshead bay which is always packed! The girl seemed completely lost, didn't know how to manage what she was doing, didn't have the skills to multitask, had zero customer service skills, or a personality. I never expect much from a fast food place, but tonight was completely horrible! Someone somewhere need to go into this place and micromanage it."

797,AvpB-RQgEW9N4Eip3l3cww,1/9/2018,1 star rating,"Our company orders Kosher food from Panini for Kosher clients very frequently and they always take forever to get there - minimum of 2 hours+. The food is usually lukewarm and unappetizing when it arrives and I have suspected that the reason they take so long is because they bike here from Williamsburg. The commute is not a valid reason for being late - try other methods of transportation. If the ETA is said to be 45 minutes, I expect the food within at most a 25-minute window period. An hour and 40 minutes late is absolutely absurd. Also, Williamsburg is not that far from downtown Brooklyn to begin with (20 minutes subway, I can advise on how to do that if needed). What's more ridiculous is that the last time we ordered from Panini in December, they even forgot our order and told me they had physically gone to our area and left to go back to Williamsburg without delivering our food. When I asked them about when they were coming back, they gave me a horrible attitude and tried to push the blame on us. This type of behavior is unacceptable. Its 2018, people need to start being more accountable for their actions."

799,_-89MKTICre2Gj6Mq-qhDA,1/14/2022,5 star rating,"Was visiting a relative in the area, and decided to get some ramen for dinner. Because of the pandemic, we opted to order take out instead of dining in, as their house wasn't too far away. The staff here are super efficient and had everything ready to go by the time I came by the restaurant to pick it up -- although maybe too efficient, as they were ready about 30 minutes before the arranged pickup time. As a result, all the food was barely even lukewarm when we started eating, but it was still delicious, so I won't dock any stars off for that.Spicy gyukotsu miso ramen: Yum yum yum. My first time trying beef bone marrow broth, and it was absolutely divine. Hands down one of the best-tasting ramen broths I've ever tried. There were hints of miso, garlic, and beef throughout. The spice wasn't very spicy, but it complemented the ramen and toppings well. I'm rather jealous that my relative can eat this practically everyday if they wanted to. 5/5Unagi pie: I've had unagi don before, which I like, but I think this takes the cake. There's slices of marinated unagi & scallions wrapped up in puff pastry, reminding me of a giant curry puff, which is Thai cuisine. It's difficult to split apart for sharing, but it can be done with a knife, albeit it'll be a bit messy. 5/5Chicken karaage: Since the food was cold when I picked it up, the karaage was no longer crispy, unfortunately. However, despite the slightly soggy texture, it was still delicious with the notes of citrus and pepper. The spicy mayo was a good dipping sauce for the bite-sized pieces of chicken.Everything I tried here was excellent, I only wish that the next time I come by, I will get a chance to dine in and enjoy the food how it was meant to be enjoyed. The restaurant was empty when I went to get the food, so I think it's possible to dine here with a small party, even if you have concerns about the pandemic, as it's not too crowded here."

I found this spot on google by typing in best ramen in Brooklyn, a few others ones showed up. I decided to try this place. The place opened up 5 PM I got there 530, there was one table there that was already eating. I was greeted and they checked my vaccination card. Never leave home without your vaccination card!! That's more important anything if you need to dine out. It would really suck if you spent some time driving there and then forgot the vaccination card. The vaccination is part of your necessity items. I was quickly seated and scanned the QR code on my phone to look at the menu. I ordered the Karage and shoyu ramen with an egg. It was $2 extra for the egg but it is worth it. The egg yolk was so creamy and the egg white was soft. I really liked it. The broth was tasty, liked the soy sauce flavor of it. The noodles were the thick wavy ones but I personally like the thin noodles. The karage (fried chicken) was kinda crispy, not as crispy as some places make it but there was more chicken to eat. The pieces were a good size."

My last time was here on a Thursday night for dinner and they did have a decent crowd. They have ramen with a beef bone broth and chicken broth. The beef bone broth is very creamy and flavorful, the beef bone ramen comes with thin noodles. My boyfriend loves the gyukotsu ramen. I've had the tan tan ramen and shio. The tan tan has a good kick to it if you're up for spicy noodles. The shio is a chicken broth base with chicken breast, a much cleaner flavor with thicker ""hand squeezed"" noodles. I enjoyed both a lot. Some might find the chicken broth on the blander side. Guess it's personal preference. I personally love their chicken karaage, it has this subtle taste of garlic flavor to it. Also comes with a nice side of spicy mayo. They also have some other interesting appetizers I'd like to try like unagi pie."

Always a great selection of beers, authentic British pub food, nice atmosphere. Last night, my wife and I returned for the first time since leaving the Upper East Side and to say I was disappointed is an understatement. The food has really taken a step back. My wife ordered the Fish and Chips which was bland, no side of lemon or Malt. The chips were extremely soggy and greasy, not a bit crispy, as if they sat for 15 minutes and steamed themselves. I got a foundry pie which was a staple in my diet back in the day, and it was decent. The mushy peas and mash had almost no flavor, and the bubble and squeak tasted 4 days old. They were also out of many popular beers, like London Pride, The Foundry Bitter, LIC Sour. I'd like to believe this was an off night, and I hope I can give them one more shot, but this was very disappointing."

This whole menu looked amazing, so my friend and I decided to split 2 items. We got the Hummus and the British Gilled Cheese.The Hummus was not only GORGEOUS, but also DELICIOUS! It came with Roasted Pepper, Lemon Garlic, and Chipotle Hummus. All three were amazing, but the Roasted Pepper was definitely my fav. The flatbread that came with it came out warm and was so good!The British Grilled Cheese was a little disappointing.

My downgrade comes from the atmosphere which isn't what it quite once was.  American pop music played from the speakers - it's a British Pub - play British music!   And the menu was a bit weird.  ""The British Cheese Board"" consisted of ""Farm House Cheddar, Stilton and Vermont Aged Goat Cheese"".  Im sorry - but why is ""Vermont Aged Goat Cheese"" on a British Cheese Board?   (The origin of the Cheddar was not quite clear) There are a million British cheeses you could put on there - and they aren't hard to get here - so why put an American cheese on the menu?   I'm shrugging. Anyway - I still love this place and will definitely go back - but it's little things like the above that gnaw at me.   Be a true British Pub in the midst of a billion other bars in NYC.  That's what makes you stand out and that's what makes you great!   Get back to your roots!"

The interior decor and the ambience are super ideal for a Sunday evening dinner, whether you are a football fan watching the playoffs or a family seeking to enjoy a homey Sunday evening. They had a good variety of English beers, which were all very pleasant. My table ordered the Chicken Liver and Foie Gras Parfait and the Sunday Roast Dinner (Roast Beef and Yorkshire Pudding). The Chicken Liver and Foie Gras Parfait came with grape jam, the actual parfait, gherkins, and 4 slices of toasted brioche, which was an ideal portion size for sampling between my table of 4. It lacked the common iron-y flavor you'd normally encounter with liver, which was a good thing. Overall, it was savory, creamy, and well-paired with the sweetness of the grape. Gherkins added a nice contrast as well.In terms of the Sunday Roast, it was pretty standard. The roast beef was definitely the highlight, as it was properly seasoned and I often find myself having to add extra salt to my roast beef but this was fine. My only gripe with the beef was a lack of consistency in terms of portion size. Slices were very uneven, so some people in my party had 3 thick slices of roast beef while others had 3 super thin slices. The accompanying sides were average, nothing special. Vegetables and potatoes had no flavor, and I've had better Yorkshire puddings."

I find out that the burrito bowl is a better option than the burrito because it has more food.Also I heard you can ask for free burrito bread as well as get other free stuff and how there are ""hacks"" on getting more food like asking for both chicken and steak,both types or rice,etc, so I ask for all that. I go to the cashier to wait for my food/pay then I see the silver bowl of food,I think hmm looks solid. Then I get my receipt....10.68?!?!?!?!? I was shocked because I am from Queens and when I buy lunch usually its around 5-6 dollars. I immediately think in my head the food must be packed/really tasty so I think whatever and walk out the door.I walk a block to an area where you can sit and enjoy your food. I am excited, I get my burrito bowl out of the unusually large brown bag. I open the silver container and see NO BREAD, I also see that the container was only full like 65%-70%, it was not packed. I say well the food is all natural and it must be healthy so I start to dig in. Then I remember....WHERES MY SPOON? There was no spoon in my bag. They expect me to eat with my hands?? This is the first time I didn't get an eating utensil for something involving rice lol. So i walk back to Chipotle and look for a spoon near the napkins, there aren't any... I have to go up to the cashier and ask her for a spoon. I have to wait a few minutes , then I get a spoon,it is black with a white streak on it... I shake my head thinking this is why someone got E-coli at Chipotle. I wasn't going to eat with my hands so I use the dirty spoon and I take my first bite of Cheapotle , the meat is cold,flavorless,and too chewy. The veggies didn't taste like anything special and the rice was flavorless... After each bite I had , I wish that I spent that 10 dollars on actual good food, but at least I can cross off Chipotle off my list of food that I want to try. :/"

She was so mad she was like oh my god.... super rude. But the person that took my order was super awesome.
829,Kh0-HmlgmVUkRxR55_Vn1g,2/26/2022,1 star rating,"The service is horrible at this location and incredibly slow. The first time I came here, I ordered ahead and my order was missing the side of queso I ordered. I called and no one picked up the phone so I wrote an email. I was given a promo code for free queso (instead of just refunding me my money). I then returned to give them another chance and had to wait in a super long line. I finally got up to order and the worker took my order and signaled for me to go to the cashier to pay (since my order was just chips and queso). The cashier then ignored me while I stood there and when I asked her what was going on and that I was told to get out of line she said ""oh you can wait"". Incredibly rude. There was queso ready so there was no excuse to have me wait even longer. I am certain I will not go back and I would recommend going elsewhere to spend your money at establishments that actually treat their customers respectfully."

Honestly, my biggest concern on the verge of pandemic was that this bar wouldn't survive; my worry was unfounded. This bar and restaurant found ways to thrive during the pandemic and continues to have a delightful menu of shared dishes in addition to delicious cocktails. The ambiance is great for a date night or small group, with a cute inside decor as well as a warmly lit outdoor atmosphere. Nim was a charismatic and charming bartender. He offers great conversation on top of memorable drinks. All in all, highly recommend.  ."
841,Kh0-HmlgmVUkRxR55_Vn1g,9/9/2022,5 star rating,Quite possibly the most immaculate cocktail list I've encountered in NYC. #4 and #7 are my favorite and I keep coming back to try everything. Both were delicious and refreshing. Wonderful service. Open airy space with chill vibes. Highly recommend for a drink and a light bite.
842,Kh0-HmlgmVUkRxR55_Vn1g,7/30/2022,5 star rating,- Lovely drinks: creative and refreshing.- Price point: is fairly standard and fair.- Service: is solid.

843,Kh0-HmlgmVUkRxR55_Vn1g,8/22/2021,5 star rating,"Stumbled across Ollie on a Friday evening. Such an amazing find, even though I was skeptical at first. It looked like a breakfast/brunch spot (with all of the white and light blue decor) and was surprised they were open so late. It wasn't too crowded so we were able to immediately get a table outside at around 10pm. THE COCKTAILS WERE PHENOMENAL. We planned on just grabbing one drink each, and ended up getting 5 total. The cocktails were so well-blended, strong, and delicious. These were probably some of the best made cocktails I've had in NYC. I was deciding between the Cocktail 7 and Coco-Mango Batido - and ended up getting both. The BLVD was also fantastic - very creative peanut butter whiskey that my boyfriend loved. Our waiter, Leo, was very attentive and friendly. He had great drink recommendations. We ended up staying until closing and would have stayed longer! Will absolutely be back - this place is a hidden gem and probably the next up and coming cocktail spot in west village."

I went on a early Friday evening when it wasn't too crowded, but it gets busy as they evening goes on so definitely make a reservation. They have outdoor and indoor seating, but I think the indoor decor is so cute that it's worth sitting inside.The drinks & food - WOW. So good! They don't have a huge food menu, but the few items I had: cheese bread, tuna, & burger wedge were so delicious. And bonus - they have more than one vegan option if you're vegan/vegetarian. I had the mezcal cocktail with beets & pineapple and it was so good! It's one of the best cocktails I've had in a while. If you're downtown this place is worth the visit. It's great for a date night, girls night. Very casual & cute!"
845,Kh0-HmlgmVUkRxR55_Vn1g,8/18/2021,5 star rating,"I was strolling in the west village and this place popped up first when I searched for cocktail bars.  Spacious decor and outdoor seating. Not too busy during the week.I sat at the bar and ordered the Cocktail 7. I like how they just create a number list for their cocktails. The #7 was created with Mi Campo Tequila, passion fruit, coconut water, lemon,aperol sprinkled with cinnamon on top. It came out well balanced and tasty. My 2nd drink was the Coco-Mango Batido from the New classics section. Tasted very creamy but not full smoothy. Made with Cana Cachaca, toasted coconut, lime and tonka bean. Just for transparency, it had a weird aftertaste maybe from the bean. I still drank that whole drink so I'm not really complaining. I'm really glad i passed by here. Great respite from the heat. Awesome cocktail list. Would you certainly return to try more cocktails."

Kind and accommodating staff as well. Would go back."
847,Kh0-HmlgmVUkRxR55_Vn1g,12/3/2021,5 star rating,"Ollie is incredible, if you haven't been here yet add it to your go-to list asap. To start, the well lit ambiance with white walls and plants adorning the ceilings is very unique for an NY cocktail bar. I love that it's bustling with good music and conversation but also quiet enough that you can hear everyone at your table.On to the drinks! Our server came quickly and gathered our drinks order and also gave us some great suggestions. You really can't go wrong with any of these drinks, they're incredibly elegant and well made. I personally love the cocktail #5 with mezcal and beet. If you like a good tequila drink, cocktail #7 is also fruit forward and phenomenal.As for food, you'd be surprised at just how good the food is here. The pao de queijo brought me straight back to South America where I'd have Brazilian cheese bread regularly. It was truly THAT good, and it comes with a cream cheese and honey that pair excellently together. I also LOVE a good tuna crudo and man this one is incredible. The dill flavor is forward and the puffed rice adds the perfect crunch. The tuna is so fresh and delicious. We also got the Ollie burger, a fantastic burger.Our waitress was nice enough to let us stay extra long and try more cocktails throughout. Overall an incredible spot, try it before the hype starts building because I'm sure it will!"
848,Kh0-HmlgmVUkRxR55_Vn1g,7/30/2022,4 star rating,"Great cocktails. The bartenders were extremely nice, the drinks were well mixed, and we had our martinis redone. There is enough seating for 25 people or so.I noticed that people here don't stand, which is a plus, so it does not get overly crowded. Note that they do last call early - I recall it being around midnight, which is surprising on a Thursday. Also, the bar is a bit short staffed. We had a great experience, but I could see others were a bit frustrated with 1-2 bartenders making 20 drinks at once.Gladly will visit again."

850,Kh0-HmlgmVUkRxR55_Vn1g,3/19/2022,2 star rating,"When I first walked by Le Botanist, I'll admit I was intrigued. I thought it was a cool new gin bar. When I found out the Dig Inn nearby was closed, I decided give Le Botanist a shot. To my chagrin, it turned out Le Botanist was a vegan restaurant (upset because it wasn't a fancy gin bar). The setup of Le Botanist is very much reminiscent of Dig Inn's asthetic. The food is all stored in le creuset enamled pots. Unfortunately the food was a bit far off the mark.My girlfriend got the Magic Miso noodles while I opted for the vegetable tangine with extra beet balls. We also got the combo that included two glasses of wine. The magic miso was very very disappointing. It was extremely ginger heavy and tasted nothing like miso. The noodles were soggy and very overcooked. The vegetable tangine was a bit better and quite a bit more filling than the magic miso. A basic vegetable stew on top of quinoa/farro. The confusing bit was that both dishes were topped with micro green stems. Not sure why they would add them, they didn't really add anything flavor wise. The beet balls were okay, a bit chalky but serviceable. I can't say that I would give Le Botaniste another try. The pricing of Le Botanist was a bit steeper than expected for the amount and quality of the food. A vegan restaurant concept akin to Dig Inn seems to be a good idea but they miss the execution quite a bit. The chefs of Le Botaniste needs to seriously rethink their recipes and do a bit more taste testing."

852,Kh0-HmlgmVUkRxR55_Vn1g,10/30/2022,1 star rating,"This meal could be the least appetizing thing I've ever seen on the UWS, and I walked by a dead rat on my way to pick up the order. The bowl was so awash in dressing that it appeared to be a soup. There was so much dressing that when I poured the excess into a wine glass (picture below) it would have been a fair wine pour. At least if it had been wine, I might have been buzzed enough to overlook how bad the food was when I started eating it! Without the dressing, the few ingredients were clumped sadly at the bottom of the bowl. Clearly the bulk of the $20 cost went into the dressing. While I believe they didn't include the pea hummus I ordered, perhaps it had disintegrated into the torrent of dressing. In any case, the bowl's ingredients had been so drowned in the dressing that they had little distinctive taste or texture. I I also ordered the Apple Volcano. The apples were desiccated and almost tasteless. Perhaps to make up for drowning me in dressing with the bowl, the Apple Volcano was served without the cashew cream it was supposed to come with. Eat anything, or nothing, rather than coming here."

Well, the tofu was burned so badly that it was inedible. To be fair I asked if there was unburied tofu and they let me replace it with quinoa. However, the noodles were just cold and kind of stale. I will never eat here again. The food is not that fresh and the prices are outrageous for this subpar food. Thanks to the staff who were accommodating but the food is just not okay."

If you are overwhelmed by the extravagance of a buffet set up, the à la carte menu is available by request.This place is pristine and spacious.

It's a small buffet consisting of different types of salads, fish, meat, rice and beansYou can eat just from the buffet or get fresh steak of ur choice from the guy behind the counter.

It's always been my bagel and sandwich fix spot because many of the neighboring delis that serve cold cuts don't have that big of a meat selection. Also, it is down the block from me.What brings me back is that the workers are friendly, attentive, and welcoming. They'll listen to your requests and accommodate. Basically there's good customer service. I don't know what these other customers are saying but I've never had a bad experience. I haven't tried many things on their menu but I love their garlic bagels, bacon/or sausage eggs and cheese on a rolls/or croissant are very good. They're reasonably priced and moderate/inconsistent portion sizes. But if you want to add anything, know that you'll be charged. Nothing's free. My cousin loves their iced coffee. And they're quick.Now, here's why I had to knock out a point. Everything I said was the highlights and my experience most of the time. Every so often, my bagels came burnt, or my toasted rolls were cold. Sometimes there was barely any cream cheese or when I add bacon, it's a small shriveled up burnt piece. Other times, I felt like I had the greatest bagel of all time because there was a generous portion. There needs to be some quality control. Or check your food before leaving. Make sure it's right."

884,cKGi-erQrad9lf87VH6cjA,1/19/2022,4 star rating,"Found this bakery for a quick cute brunch with my parents in town. We were so overwhelmed with all the choices in the display case, as well as all the different baguettes and loaves of bread. We finally settled on the potato scallion and cheese frittata and some pastries - pasteis de nata, kouign amann, raspberry danish, and sticky bun cinnamon roll. All of it was great, although tough to cut into 4 shareable sizes. The frittata was my favorite, followed by the sticky bun, then the kouign amann (dipped in my coffee), then the raspberry danish.We also got a rosemary meyer lemon sourdough to go. This wasn't the best, especially compared to some other sourdough offerings in the neighborhood. A little overcooked on the outside and pretty dry on the inside. Not particularly flavorful, but I appreciate the flavor profile they were going for. Definitely something you want to eat fresh, not specifically shelf stable.Would definitely come again for the breakfast pastries and coffee as a weekend treat."

Ample seating indoors as well as two outdoor patio spaces- out front where they allow dogs and out back.  Great spot for delicious breakfast and a slow catch up. I never feel rushed here. The selection for breakfast is vast. I always have a hard time deciding because they have everything from croissants to danishes to frittatas to delicious sandwiches that all span the gamut of sweet to savory. There's something here for everyone. The breakfast sandwich & a sweet item to share is the go to whenever I come with a friend. Importantly, coffee is strong, espresso is smooth. I enjoyed a flat white with my breakfast which went perfectly. Five stars all around!"

We were turned away by the owner because she was saving the tables. Let me just say the place was EMPTY! There is a total of 3 booth and 3 separate tables ALL EMPTY! she stated the tables were ONLY for dinner. She was worried about making money and not having the space available. So she decided her best business decision was to turned us away. 2 customers willing and ready to spend money. We sat in the car annoyed for at least 45mins and Not 1 customer went in to buy dinner!! Such a shame for someone to do business like that!!

Dinner was completed  with a delicious chocolate lava type cake, but the best one I ever had. Bruna, the owner also made a homemade dip for bread when we first got there. We will be regulars and we live in NJ. It's worth the toll. It's some of the best food I ever ate. You will not be disappointed."

899,oFRX5R0Bn_1rIeiPEP1VSw,4/10/2022,5 star rating,"Best restaurant on the Island hands down, without question. Whenever somebody from other boroughs ask me where to eat on Staten Island, I send them to Dolce. Everyone comes back to me raving about the experience they had. Bruna and Jon treat everyone that walk in like family, and they'll remember you every time you return. You can tell that this is more than business to them. It's a dream and a passion, and you can taste it, too! The south shore and north shore locations are both equally fantastic. The south shore location has more modern trendy decor; the north shore has more of a hole in the wall hidden gem pizzeria vibe.The only complaint I've ever gotten was that the portions are ""small for the price."" To that I say, this is authentic hand-made Italian food. The portions are authentic as well. In America we seem to be used to a half a pound of pasta alongside every Italian dish. If that's what you're looking for, go to Olive Garden. If you're looking for fine, quality food from fresh ingredients, go to Dolce Fantasia. You won't regret it."

The service is always wonderful, friendly and helpful. This is a family friendly place the atmosphere is  welcoming  and homey. Please do yourself a favor and ORDER  dessert. My personally favorite is the tiramisu but ALL of the hand crafted desserts are delectable. And lastly, most importantly; you will not find a better latte anywhere else. I can drink this by the galón and straight up. No sugar just the richness of the expression and the richness of the milk. So.  So. Good."

We ordered the arugula salad, chicken meatballs, a veggie burger (for me) and a pasta with chicken dish for him. My 2 year old and infant were obsessed with the chicken meatballs to a point where we had to order an extra serving. And seriously, they were amazing. Tender, delicious, and the sauce they were served in was very unique. I never thought I'd be raving about a veggie burger either, but best veggie burger I've ever had. My husband was even looking at me like...you're going crazy over a veggie burger? Yes, yes I was. The veggie patty was juicy and so flavorful, blended perfectly with the cheese. I inhaled the burger in under 5 minutes. Will definitely be back. The owner, Bruna, is an amazing chef."

The sauce that you can dip the spring rolls were a plus to its taste because it was sweet and a little bit sour. I enjoyed the peanut sauce dressing with the salad.And lastly, the cashew nut tofu was very sweet, but eaten with the white rice balanced it out.Overall a refreshing lunch."

But she didn't look over. I finally gathered the courage to get up and leave and I said ""sorry"". She gave me the nastiest look. Maybe she thought I saw the menu prices and couldn't afford it.

Mai Thai has decent curry-- it's a little thinned out but there are always lots of veggies. The delivery is usually on time and I've never had any trouble with receiving a wrong order. However, the delivery man is pretty curmudgeonly. The last time I ordered, he called and told me to come out and proceeded to hand over my food through the window of his car.

I tried the vegetarian ginger dish. It was okay, not great-a bit oily. It was also had a disappointing lack of diverse veggies in it. The ginger sauce was very flavorful but it only had onions, carrots and a few soggy mushrooms. Brown or jasmine rice on the side comes with the dish.They do add ""veggie"" chicken or beef which made up for it a bit but I wasn't totally blown away. Fine for a delivery meal but if I lived in the area, I can't see making it regular place."

In the description, the eggplant basil was suppose to be SPICY; however, it was quite sweet instead! It felt as if they put tablespoons of sugar in the dish. It wasn't appetizing at all. I would not recommend ordering it. The red curry with vegetables was edible. Overall, this Thai restaurant is a poor example of Thai food. I have tried several Thai restaurants as Thai food is one of my favorite cuisines and this restaurant was a big setback and disappointment. Save your money!"

Before i get to the lobby theres a waiting area , and thats where i met the delivery guy. He was very rude and upset and said ""why u hung up i heard u on the phone!!"" and rudely handed my bag and walked away. I stood there surprised at his rudeness and the patients that were in the waiting area were surprised as well. I dont need this type of behavior in my workplace. When i picked up the phone i didnt hear anyone repond back when i said hello. So knowing he may be waiting, i rushed to the lobby which couldnt have been more than 2minutes. I see other reviewers complain about their rudeness, and after encountering their delivery guy i can see how this is true. As for the food, it was ok. More sweet than spicy. Would probably have ordered again. but now i really doubt it."

I wanted to try the orange blossom pancake because the flavor sounded interesting. Sadly, they didn't have it. They ran out of it which is super weird because it's such a popular breakfast brunch item. It's also the item that propelled me to try this restaraunt. Instead, I ordered the salmon Benedict.

Bizarrely for a French restaurant they use heavy cream in so many things( ramen Mac and cheese, risotto, etc) and they only have one type of cheese available to order... American cheese. Come on, this is a French place... where's the Brie, Camembert, Beaufort, Fourme d' Ambert?  Malheureusement, it was disappointing and unfulfilling to eat here. The brand of the veggie burger is Dr.Pragers. I don't love it nor hate it. The best part of the burger was the seeded roll. I might just have come for the wrong meal, their brunch looks lovely and maybe, next time I might try brunch. They also charge a credit card fee even though I paid in cash."

My only interactions with the staff were to take my order, receive the food, and pay the check.While the eggs Benedict itself was good, the salad that it came with was prepared with wilted lettuce.

Our waiter abandoned us after someone dropped our food even though she was walking by our table. We had another waiter cash is out and we she didn't speak to us again.

I've heard really good things about the mussels too, will have to try them the next time I stop by!It can get busy on the weekends and they take reservations so I would recommend doing that if you plan to come for brunch, just to be on the safe side!

We ordered lunch from To Be Thai today through Grubhub and were very pleased. Our food arrived in only 20 minutes and was hot and delicious. We had Pad Thai Chicken, Grilled Chicken Yum, Crispy Calamari, and Crispy Tofu. We'll definitely order from them again!"

I love a good location with quick employees who serve up appropriate topping portions!!The workers here definitely know what they're doing, in contrast to some other locations that don't mix salads well or provide any toppings. I always go with the Kale Caesar but have recently been trying to expand my palate. Their new seasonal bowl, the miso bowl, is absolutely delicious! I get it w no rice to cut out some carbs, and it's absolutely amazing. Definitely excited to try  out some of their other seasonal options!The lunchtime lines here get insanely long however;  definitley be sure to order ahead in the app!"

Yes it's fast casual (not saying it's fine dining or michelin quality) but for what it is, I give us 5 stars. shroomami is my favorite that I often get, but the fish taco, elote, and curry chickpea were also great. If I'm looking for healthy takeout that will make me feel good I always opt for sweetgreen."
947,VXB2v7QVe2APSgeSqpmdGw,2/8/2020,4 star rating,"I've tried sweetgreen once or twice before, so it was nice to stop in again and try something new. I can be pretty indecisive sometimes, so I went with the preset Buffalo Chicken salad bowl. I love how you get to see what goes into your salad, and how you get to control how much dressing they put. I probably asked for too much hot sauce because it was actually a tad spicy. Other than that, I really like how the flavors blended together in the combination of blackened chicken, blue cheese, Caesar dressing, and sweetgreen hot sauce. Prices are a bit steep, but I think it's worth it. Will definitely be back, as there are plenty sweetgreens scattered in Manhattan!"

Let's consider that I am not the arrogant or demanding type of person so if you mistreat customers when you get the order and don't make it on purpose , and then ALSO start hating and saying '' you think this is a gym? we do not have to mix the salad too'' just lazy woman, I will complain and let the manager or whoever is in charge online about the low quality service you have for the price you pay, not worth it I hope they're not there anymore cuz it's the closest one to my place."

I decided to try something new which was the buffalo chicken warm. Since they were out of the pickled carrots + celery I got to substitute for two items..that was fine with me. I got quinoa and shredded carrots. I also got the blue cheese and hot sauce on the side. No bread.The servers were extremely patient with the client in front of me who was being a diva. Sorry not sorry. A special salad was created for her and then she disputed what was asked for. I honestly believed she was a sweet green employee from another location. ‍ oh well.

There's a clean bathroom and the service is pretty good. We enjoyed hanging back but also sitting up front at the bar. Not too divey, kind of hipstery. I like the lit candles on the tables and bars.

This bar is particularly great for beer fans. They have an awesome rotating list of draft beers as well as bottled. Some interesting beer cocktails are also available. Never fails to disappoint and always super chill on any given night.The owl theme the decorates the fairly large interior is super cute. Owl clocks, murals, drawings, sculptues, etc provide random yet inviting decor for a casual, hip bar. The crowd is always mixed and chill. The noise level is not bad, background music is cool but not too loud. There is a considerable amount of seating throughout the bar and tables towards the back. Never had issues getting a seat. The very back of the room has a setup of some working pinball machines. The space gets somewhat more intimate at night with the really dim lighting and low lit candles. Service here is always great as the bartenders are very attentive to all their customers.Note there is no food here except for some bar snacks such as kettle chips, but there are plenty of restaurants near by. A minimum of $15 if using credit card. The beer menu is pretty awesome as there is a new brew to always discover. They have a great lineup of craft beers that range from your ipa to a nice hard cider. Aside from beer is also an extensive wine menu. The pricing is very reasonable, and I enjoy the fact they provide different size servings at different price points.Overall the perfect spot for a chill night spent drinking a tasty beer or two. The Owl Farm is a bit out of the way, but if you happen to be around this part of Brooklyn, totally worth the visit."

When you have all of these in one place, people will come. My husband and I have been coming to Owl Farm when it first opened  two and a half years ago. Something about this bar keeps us coming back. It may be because of the: - Great beers from breweries like Other Half, Hill Farmstead, BFM, Alpine, etc. that we can't get enough of- Beer events they have like the Stout event where my husband and I came to try out the different stouts they had on tap for 3 consecutive days- Dog friendliness  where you can bring your dogs into the bar. Note that as of 4/1/2015, no dogs will be allowed in the bar from 6pm - 12am but allowed other times when the bar is open. - Awesome bartenders & manager that know the locals and love beer as much as we do and friendly with the newcomers. - Happy hour special till 7pmThe list can go on.

(2.5/5)overall, i'll continue going to sweetgreen in the future, but not at this location. i wish that i could rate this place higher than 2 stars, but i can't get over how unreasonable the price was for such low quality food."

Glad I went on a day when I didn't have immediate meetings after. The bowl was huge, but not the stuffs within - size was normal. You will have to specify you need bread so that they don't miss it."

Maybe stick to beer or well drinks, and nurse them while you and your friend or date soak it in. While the front rooms and bar area were poppin', with every seat taken, the restaurant was spacious and mostly empty. Not ghostly-empty, but nice and intimate. We didn't have to raise our voices to be heard, which is a rarity in restaurants downtown. The food was, on the whole, really tasty. The tagliatelle wasn't anything special, but my friend loved her steak and both desserts were tasty. The coffee was surprisingly good, and I really appreciated that they not only had nondairy milk but didn't charge extra for it! Our server was attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and really sweet.

986,SdQsynrdEjalHmiZ9lK5dw,1/28/2019,5 star rating,"I am stunned to see that Margaux only has three stars. It's a good thing that I discovered this restaurant in a twist of fate - I happened to be staying in The Marlton Hotel - because had I seen the Yelp rating, I wouldn't have given it a chance. I've been here six times now.First of all, the menu changes weekly, and the dishes are so fresh that I think of Margaux as a farm-to-table restaurant. Consider the ""Farmer's Board,"" for example, featuring sea salt crackers, spicy smashed sweet potato, avocado hummus, and beets sprinkled with grains of paradise. Or the spicy Lacinato Kale Salad, which I always order even though I can't stand salads - grated parsnip, jalapenos, olive oil, lemon, sunflower seeds.What really steals the show, however, is the Squid Ink Bucatini, served with Maine lobster and seasoned with Calabrian chilies. Make sure you have the appetite because the bucatini pasta is thick!If you plan to eat lighter, I suggest the classic Spaghetti Pomodoro, which will satiate the faintest pings of hunger and leave you with a happy stomach. (In other words: Have you ever had trouble sleeping because you ate healthily but your soul was still hungry for some real flavor? I guarantee this will not happen if you eat at Margaux). The food is healthy and ingredients freshly sourced, yet you won't feel like you're depriving yourself at all.By the way, the best kept secret at Margaux is the wide range of ice cream flavors on the dessert menu - this ice cream is FANTASTIC. You must give it a whirl, even in the dead of winter (the ambiance itself is very warm and cozy to compensate for the cold scoops). When I went last weekend, I actually ordered the pumpkin cheese cake, which came with a scoop of bourbon ice cream. Baller."

I was sure if you were supposed to mix the quinoa snd one if the spreads together on your cracker. The quinoa seemed an odd mix with the other spreads.

Hot toddy and a Cosmo we asked, which by the way came in different moments. hot toddy was fine as for the Cosmo, it just tasted like a sweet lemonade, I requested a waiter to change it, as we rarely saw our waitress, somebody came (think the manager) to confirm my cosmo, then waitress came and took it, they made another one, much better. The bartender politely came to check on us and the new cosmo which I gladly appreciated. We only had the pleasure to see our waitress a couples of times , dropping the check was one of them and just to discover that she just had charged me house premium vodka which she never asked on the first place what kind of vodka I wanted, she just assumed I wanted the priciest vodka on the menu!

Food:Fresh winter root vegetables: complimented the custardCauliflower custard with crispy kale: heavy but deliciousFluke crudo: beautifully presented and deliciousLamb meatballs: mediocre Burrata with leeks: I hate leeks but the burrata was tasty and creamyBucatini with lobster: spicy but delicious. The pasta was cooked perfectly - al dente. Risotto with mushroom: goodLamb chops: executed almost perfectlyLemon posset: best dessert of the ones we gotCrostata: goodPineapple: mediocre
993,SdQsynrdEjalHmiZ9lK5dw,3/14/2017,2 star rating,"This restaurant is really charming and lovely; the ambience is great; it feels a secret little pocket in NYC.The food is okay, albeit overpriced compared to similar tastiness at other restaurants, especially in the area. We both had burgers from the lunch menu.The service is sloooooooooooooow. Super slow. Our server and busser were really nice, but it seemed like they were understaffed. I never noticed anybody just hanging out -- but there simply were too few people working to attend to the lunch crowd.  Again, once we were able to flag them down, they were lovely and friendly, but it was tough to flag them down."
994,hPJ7x8rfSsJ4ObgHeAK5kg,8/10/2022,5 star rating,"Visited on a Monday afternoon for these pizzas. This perhaps is one of my most favorite pizza place in williamsburg. It's located near the subway station and surrounded by lots of restaurants and shops. The place is very easy to go in and out. They take both cash and credit cards. Inside there are some standing tables and there are some outdoor seating tables. Tables are first come first serve. No reservation.. If order is to-go, make sure to tell the cashier, so they can box your pizza. Otherwise, they will put pizzas on a paper plate. Pizza is pretty fresh, thin sliced. Portion of the slice is huge. 2 slice will get a average size man pretty full. Crusty on bottom and toppings are pretty awesome. This is pretty typical ""good"" NY pizza you can find in a neighborhood."
995,hPJ7x8rfSsJ4ObgHeAK5kg,1/6/2023,4 star rating,"We came here after 11pm and there was still quite a bit of a line. Pizza here is pretty solid. It's your true NY style pizza. Thin but yet crispy on the bottom which was nice. However, it's nothing amazing that I would come back to wait in line for. I'd want to check out other pizzas if I were in the area to see if there are better ones."
996,hPJ7x8rfSsJ4ObgHeAK5kg,12/6/2022,5 star rating,"Truly amazing NY style pizza. Worth the wait which goes by pretty fast. The location off the corner in Williamsburg has probably a fraction of the wait at Times Square so if you're a tourist, I'd just hop over the Brooklyn bridge and hang out there for a slice.We went on a pizza tour with some folks who have never been to NY and I'm disappointed to say Joe's Pizza wasn't on the tour. We were heading back to our hotel to get our luggage to go home when we saw this pizza spot and popped in for a slice. REALLY REALLY SERENDIPITOUS that our last meal was one of the best meals. Reg slice with pepperoni is $4.50, waited about 3-5min total from ordering, paying and getting the slice fresh outta the oven."
997,hPJ7x8rfSsJ4ObgHeAK5kg,3/8/2023,5 star rating,Classic NY slices! Just like the West Village location. The white slice is delicious too! Service is excellent  Open late
998,hPJ7x8rfSsJ4ObgHeAK5kg,2/24/2023,4 star rating,I had Joe's a few times in Manhattan but I just got the slices and I've always been meaning to get it fresh out the oven. My prior experiences had been underwhelming for me but I know how freshness can make a huge difference. I had my opportunity this time when they made a brand new pie and I had to try it. The cheese was plentiful but the sauce is very basic and lacks much flavor. It's decent but overrated.
999,hPJ7x8rfSsJ4ObgHeAK5kg,2/25/2022,4 star rating,"Our first stop for food in the city was at Joe's Pizza. It popped up on Yelp and we knew we wanted some pizza while in town of course. They have a credit card minimum so bring some cash if you're only getting a slice or two. Nate and I got one slice of mozzarella to split since we knew we'd be eating a lot on this visit.I liked that they put the slice into the oven for a second to heat it up. The sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking, but tasted really fresh. The mozzarella was tasty. The slice was a generous size for a snack to share, but if I wanted a meal here I'd probably get a couple slices by myself. Really thin crust means you can eat more slices, it's science. There was no indoor dining when we were there in November 2021 but they had cocktail tables outside near the curb that you could eat at. Or just fold your slice up and take it on the go!"
1000,hPJ7x8rfSsJ4ObgHeAK5kg,12/20/2022,3 star rating,"I am a lover of pizza. We were hungry so I decided to order three regular slices from Joe's pizza. While the taste of the pizza was good, we weren't pleased with the taste of the crust and bottom of the pizza. It was too dark for our liking and it tasted burnt. Maybe it was kept in the oven a little longer than it should have been. My first visit here wasn't good. However, I love the atmosphere and the energy here. On my way out, one of the guys told me thank you and ""I'll see you tomorrow"" which I thought was cute. I would definitely like to try them again."
1001,hPJ7x8rfSsJ4ObgHeAK5kg,8/15/2022,5 star rating,"It's a classic for a reason! Bring cash. I recommend the plain slice with lots of oregano sprinkled on top, preferably late at night after you've had a few drinks. Nothing tastes better."
1002,hPJ7x8rfSsJ4ObgHeAK5kg,7/16/2022,5 star rating,Perfect NY pizza! It's all I wanted for my recent trip to NYC. Haven't been to NYC in about 8 yrs. And Joe's definitely fulfilled my craving!
1003,hPJ7x8rfSsJ4ObgHeAK5kg,8/30/2022,5 star rating,"Stopped in for a quick slice on our walk through Brooklyn and we were definitely glad we did. The place was popping with the lunch crowd which immediately re-enforced our desire to order - with all the options for pizza in NYC, a line at one meant it had to be good, right? Right. Grabbed a slice of the white pizza to split with my travel companion and it was fire. Very heavy on the garlic and cheese - it had us both wishing we'd ordered our own slice. Definitely appreciated the big dallops of ricotta cheese that hot the top of the pizza. Slice is also huge so definitely not a bad thing to split - next time would probably order two slices and have 1/2 of each."

One young male employee was arrogant as he pulled his mask off while I was waiting for my order.  When I told the female employee behind the register why I was waiting near the door, she asked him to put it on.

Then i go to and pay with the app waited 10 min which was my fault only to be told sir what are you waiting for . Told them and they had a confused look on face like I'm the issue . That whole place freakin blows . Get my drink with no apology. Went to another Starbucks .. and oh wait my birthday drink scanned .. that's amazing ! Train your staff on how to use the same register
1006,pFrxezxzly8wqSJPIG7Ptw,5/5/2019,2 star rating,"Waited 15 minutes for a mobile order with 2 drinks. No sense of urgency from employees. I understand there was a shift change but on a mobile order, it shows you on the sticker how many drinks there are. This girl made one drink then walked away and someone else started making drinks. Then she proceeds to stare at me while I wait for my second drink. Would it have hurt to ask me what I'm waiting for? It's like they're robots that can't talk to customers. They sure did a lot of talking to each other. Not one person noticed I was waiting for 15 minutes???  Terrible. The Starbucks on victory is way better."

Really!  Baristas or not, they're working at Starbucks! So that means if they're given a job to serve the public, then they're there to do just that, that is serve the public with kindness, professionalism, and respect. That being said, you shouldn't be forced to experience rude and unprofessional behavior! I mean, I want a lousy coffee and a cake and the supervisor is too busy having a personal conversation with one of her workers about her boyfriend. I guess, her personal relationships are more important than her customers? Amazing, how this only happens in Staten Island. The last stop to nowhere! And coming to this place is a clear reminder of that fact!"

I finally found this Starbucks after 10 minutes of circling around a few blocks. They only have half the Starbucks menu. They don't offer the same drinks as Brooklyn. They actually don't offer any seasonal items. The cashier was nice and friendly but that's about it. Nothing about this Starbucks will make me come back here anytime soon."

I haven'r really had any problems with the staff, they usually never gave me attitude and usually greeted me with a smile. However, the drinks here are some of the worst I've ever ordered from any Starbucks. Some of the drinks you order usually are never filled up all the way. I did NOT pay $6 to get half a cup of air! The drinks are never good, and always bitter. You also have to be buzzed in to use the restroom, I don't understand why they can't just take away the code and let you just simply use the restroom. The outlet plugs don't work, and you have to walk around to the back to find one that does."

Half the time the staff do not get orders right, and use laziness to attempt to rectify them. The other half you get cheated on what you ordered. I ordered a flavored latte today and got half a cup of foam. I didn't ask for a cappuccino, I asked for a latte - I do not want to pay $5 for air. The last time ordered it I was missing the flavored syrup. I'm going to have to find a new Starbucks on my way to work."

Three chicken tacos and a soda were $16 which seems expensive especially considering that the tacos were really subpar.

I've been ordering from this spot for 2+ years and the quality of the food and service has gone steadily downhill. Well today took the cake. I ordered on Seamless at 2:14.

The fries were crunchy and dry and the both the patty and bun were dry and hard. What made it even worse was the disgusting appearance of the actual container. WHY is it so filthy?  After spending tond of money here over the years, I doubt I'll ever order here again.So I walked down to El Paso myself to get them to remake my order. The person at the register tried to convince me that everything is made to order. Sooo...what is THIS then? I took the refund instead. Spend your money elsewhere folks. I hope the manager sees this since they NEVER seem to be around."
1038,DI5A-3PzqAHqh5ynp8yebw,7/21/2021,2 star rating,2 Stars because the food is ridiculously priced. $14 for 3 tacos. The food wasn't tasty enough to return. I ordered ALL barbacoa and had found a piece of chicken which I did NOT order. The meat wasn't dry and was shredded well. Beans are an extra dollar. I will never return to this place because of the pricing. You can and will be more satisfied dragging yourself miles away to a Chipotle where you can get more food with better seasoning and quality of service for less. Also they do NOT wear masks.

They are attentive to detail, and while I have gotten food without some add ons in the past (guacamole with a vegetarian burrito) they always label the food (if you get more than one item) and deliver quickly. Not to mention, their food is delicious. The El Paso House Fire Salsa is TO DIE FOR, I dream about it every day. When I ate pork, I loved their chorizo. Their chicken is always moist and perfectly seasoned. They are one of my go-to's. Their healthy burrito with quinoa has been a game changer since I can still get the flavors I want, without all of the carbs of rice. Thanks to the El Paso team for keeping me fed, happy, and giving me food that makes me feel at home, especially during the last 6+ months of COVID craziness here. You guys are awesome."

If you live in the neighborhood, & drink coffee, daily, I would highly recommend considering ($8.99/ month for unlimited coffee, & tea).  Workers here are friendly, & nice. They could probably use some extra staff sometimes, imo. P.S., they moved the rapid pick behind the cashier, so you'll need to speak to cashier to get your mobile orders (no need to get on line, but stand to the side of where customers order)."

The decor is simple, bright but kind of narrow-spaced. It was popular but not that crowded. The staff was slow, reluctant and not really friendly. Their food was decent with reasonable price and great portion. Our favorites were the Thai Chopped Chicken Salad and the Panini with Cheese & Ham. The sauce of Thai salad was flavorful and appetitive."

1058,FvCslLyo0SlDKI52bEDekQ,8/31/2021,5 star rating,"Outback is an awesome place to eat, especially for a chain steakhouse restaurant.  I have been going there since they opened and since I used to work close by I would go every two weeks during my lunch break for a steak and some beers (I had a very stressful job as a computer technician working in the malls busiest store, you can guess where if you're local!).  After the first few years they took a nosedive (right around a year or so after corporate remodeled the decor and got rid of those cool ass boomerangs and stuff on the walls like the shark teeth biting a Fosters can). The service and management seemed to stop caring, the steaks were getting cooked into oblivion and the apps would sit too long under heat lamps and dry out. I stopped going for a long time and recently decided to give them another shot, especially during these goofy pandemic times where the government gets to decide how businesses run themselves. Anyway the good news is the last 4 times I've gone here in the past 3 months they've gotten back to when I loved them the most.  The steaks are cooked perfect when I want them medium or medium rare. I get the Outback Special steak with a side of steakhouse Mac and cheese along with Aussie fries that have melted cheese on top. The food was seasoned well and the appetizers were very tasty. I'm a huge fan of the Kokaburra Wings (Buffalo wings) with a side of ranch sauce. The chicken is always juicy and the seasoning is amazing.  I'm not into onions but apparently the breading for the famous Bloomin' Onion is used on this chicken too! Jacky the bartender used to serve me almost every time I went during my lunch breaks and she is awesome. Always has a great attitude and she is quick to serve when the drinks are empty. She was the last waitress to help myself, my fiancé and our little boy when we went the last time (3 days prior to this review).  Their bread and butter while you wait is delicious and they have a new breaded chicken entree that is very tasty. I almost got that chicken but that damn Outback special is just too good to pass up on when I'm there. My review is based on the fact that I've had many more positive experiences than negative. The hostess and staff is very friendly and the environment in there is accommodating and welcoming.  My fiancé and I came here in early July and she ordered a salmon that was burned on the bottom, but the waitress took it back and brought us back a way better replacement salmon and new sides. Hey shit happens, and I don't hold any grudges for mistakes that were fixed properly. The only thing that bothers me about Outback is their corporate masters remove some pretty awesome items from their menus and it hurts my soul. Tassie Strips we're amazing strips of chicken marinated in hot sauce that were to die for. Then they changed them into Tassie Bites, tasty chicken bites but not as good as their predecessor the strips. Now they have neither!  Why?!  I'll take the bites over nothing but sheesh bow I get neither, so upsetting. For my fiancé her favorite was the Parmesan Crusted chicken, absolutely delicious entree they killed off for some reason I can't begin to explain. Lastly was my fiancé's other go to entree the bourbon salmon, deleted!  Sad!  I hope they come to their senses and bring these items back to their next menu (or at least just the Tassie strips they were so killer).  Anyway this review was long for sure but I believe since I've eaten here so often throughout the years they deserve a thorough review. Like I said I've had several more positive experiences than negative (maybe 3 negative times out of the 90 or more times I've been here). If you like steak and tasty chickens with unique and awesome appetizers come to Outback."

Also Restaurant was extremely hot and uncomfortable to eat in. I saw multiple people fanning themselves. With the lighting it felt like we were under a heat lamp baking. Hoping it was just cause of the weather being a bit warmer outside. Seats were extremely worn and was kinda embarrassed sitting in the booth were we were placed.

We came here without a reservation for an early dinner and were able to get seated at the bar right away. The bartender was delightful and gave us great recommendations for wine. One of my favorites was an orange wine that was light and delicious. The food is all mostly small portions that are meant for sharing and definitely on the pricier side. We ordered a flatbread with anchovies, yellowfin tuna, and clams with chorizo. While I thought everything was good, we left still feeling hungry even though the bill came out to ~$150 after tip and tax. Overall, still a great option for date night. I'd be interested in coming back since they change the menu so often."

Very soft, kind energy, wrapped in a bustling small blond-wooded space. If you know going in that this is a wine bar, primarily, with small plates where the cooking is top notch, you won't be left hungry (or spend too much). Everything we ate was interesting and delicous. Yes, it is expensive, and yes, I don't think anything equals a ""dinner"" in its breadth, but it does what it does very well. The servers were very informed about wine, I tasted several glasses, loved each one. The service, overall, is thorough and attentive. Happy to report the music perfectly matched the vibe of the place. I have to add that in now bc on a recent trip to a coffee shop on Metropolitan, in Williamsburg on a bright sunny Saturday morning, they were blaring EDM. So glad TFH got it right!Another gem: the past midnight secret speakeasy next door, Night Moves, formerly Larry Lawrence, and still (I think?) known as Day Moves when the sun is in the sky.TFH also do brunch and lunch during the week! Absolutely make a reservation, walk-ins are tough here, given the size of the space, and its (deserved) continuing popularity."

After visiting I have decided that my assessment was correct. The place itself is cool and the restaurant is beautiful - intimate without being too sexy. The wine list is expansive, featuring many natural wines. Wines by the glass are limited and I'm not sure if they have a full bar, but they definitely don't have a cocktail menu. Our sommelier was phenomenal - patient, friendly, helpful - everything you could possibly ask for. The bottle she chose for us was fantastic. We all took a picture of the label to save for later.The food was great. We ordered a bunch of things to split and it's definitely a ""sharing"" menu. The menu changes frequently. We loved the snap pea salad and the yellowfin tuna. The only meh dish was the turnips. Prices were fine - only reason this is a 4 star review instead of a 5 star. Imo, a snap pea dish just simply shouldn't be $19. That's crazy. We ordered 5 plates between the 3 of us and were still hungry. It's a Michelin star so we weren't expecting huge portions at low prices, but still. Would return but wouldn't run back."

It was a super humid and hot night so sitting in a constructed box with inadequate ventilation was not ideal. They seemed to still have their winter heaters up. It would be amazing if they could replace them with fans! But the great service, wine, food and company made up for the terrible weather. We had two bottles of wine, a white and an orange. Both were amazing. I would come back just to sample the wine. As a party of four, we thought it was easiest to just get the entire menu. I must say all the ingredients were very fresh! There were some hits and misses. 1) Grilled flatbread: reportedly it was their first night serving this dish. The concept was great, but half the flatbread was too burnt so when split four ways, two of us only tasted the burnt pieces. 3/5.2) Marinated mussels: I loved that the server warned us that the dish only came with a total of four mussels. Each was placed on a half shell and all four were on top of many empty shells. The cucumber and cilantro topping was very fresh. Still a little shocked that 4 mussels came out to be 16 dollars. 4/5.3) Beef tenderloin takaki: I loved how generous they were with the Parmesan cheese. Arugula is my favorite salad vegetable so this was one of my favorite dishes of the night. 5/5.4) Tokyo turnips: I love turnips. This dish had a very refreshing sauce on top. 5/55) Snap pea salad: I loved how simple this was. I cannot emphasize how fresh this was too! 5/5.6) Grilled squid: The pieces were tiny but cooked well. The sauce had a spicy kick to it. 4/57) Spinach crostini: I think we all loved this! 5/58) Yellowfin tuna: I think we all have had our share of fish via omakases so we weren't sure if this disappointed us bc we've had better fish elsewhere. 3/5.9) Manila clams: I love clams. My mom has a great recipe and I had a lot clams in Portugal recently. There was something missing here. Maybe more garlic? 3/5.10) Fried chicken: not bad! Loved the vegetables on top! 4/511) beef tongue saagm: this was very intricate! It was cooked to perfection. The only odd thing is there were more lettuce wraps than meat... 5/512) Stuffed quail: I really liked the rice in the quail! 5/5We loved all the desserts.All in all, a fantastic experience with very few dishes we didn't enjoy.

I unfortunately caught my older brother too late to have dinner with me but he said he would join me for drinks. I arrived right at opening, 5pm. They have it on their website that they make sure to keep spots available for walk in's. Took a minute to get my vax checked and get seated. They let me have an extra stool at the bar for my older brother. The bartender was pre occupied with some familiar faces, regulars and such. I enjoyed overhearing highlights and descriptions of the menu. When he got to me, I knew I wanted the second orange wine, Sumenjak on the menu and the yellowfin tuna to start. The tuna looked like a red rose. It was a thin layer of tuna on aioli infused with more decadent fish. The atmosphere was calm, the restaurant was classy but the door was drafty. My older brother finally arrived and also ordered the orange wine. My second course was the leek toast. I loved so many of the elements from the sardines, walnut bread, braised leeks and the whipped ricotta. My older brother and I have similar palettes. I knew he would love it, I gave him a little nibble. He exclaimed that the bread was so high quality that it reminded him of his recent trip to Italy. I ordered the clams in a fennel soffritto for my main course. My brother loved dunking the bread in the broth. A spectacular dish on a crisp, cool evening. My older brother then spotted a dessert at the corner of his eye, at the end of the bar. It appeared like a giant, fluffy potato on a silver tier. We had to have it. ""Fior di latte gelato""  with coffee zabaglione! A delicious chocolate, nutty cloud covering a cool vanilla gelato. My older brother ordered an amaro. And we wrapped up our delightful experience finishing our springy, fresh white wines, dessert and amaro. We left with our tummies full, our heart fluttering and a desire for our next visit!"

All of the dishes are small plates, and are generally shareable.I tried the following dishes:Burrata (4/5): I love burrata and order it at basically every restaurant. This was a nice dish. It came with oregano oil and a sesame focaccia.Smoked Eel Fritters (5/5): Very unique dish that I think is worth a try. The eel was cooked well, and the breading was nice. Came with a saffron pil pil.Broiled Razor Clams (4.5/5): I am a huge fan of razor clams, and these were great. They came with calabrian chili and a really nice green garlic butter. Would recommend if you like seafood.Celery Salad (4.5/5): Super interesting and tasty. Came with walnuts, medjool dates, and piave vecchio cheese. This was a favorite of the table.Grilled Sasso Chicken Leg + Thigh (5/5): Very good chicken dish. The leg and thigh remained attached at serving. This was a little hard to take apart to eat, but was really good. Came with a black rice and cilantro stem. The rice paired really nicely with the chicken.Bone-In Skate Wing (4.5/5): Really tasty skate. The meat was tender and fell off the bone, and came with morel mushrooms, ramps, and beurre blanc.

But if you're not restricted to keeping kosher, I would say to not come here just because being surrounded by a ton of Orthodox people may be awkward for ya. Tuna appetizer - it's three pieces on top of veggies. It wasn't very tender, but it is the healthiest appetizer they offer. Salmon entree - I loved this entree. The salmon was delicious and the ratatouille it comes with was super tasty. If you're not into getting steak, this is a smart substitute. Tuna salad - huge salad. But it's mainly lettuce. There's a big chunk of grilled tuna, and my friend didn't like it, but I loved every bite. My friend had actually ordered the chicken salad and they brought out the tuna salad accidentally. The service was sweet, but they seemed stretched way too thin, even on a chill night at a late time. Maybe hire some more people? Anyway, it was a solid, healthy dinner, and I'm so glad I'm now aware of an actually good kosher restaurant in the city."

He brought out a steak frites + salad plate for me (correct), but he brought the incorrect entree for my sister who had ordered prime rib.

This is not a rant from a wine obsessed diner, but when we eat out we expect our meal to be served completely and to not have to chase our waiter for the basics.  We will be back (the foods is truly amazing), but will leave if the same person is our waiter."

They definitely ""butchered"" the steaks. The only bright spots were the hostesses and the wait staff, very nice and accommodating."

Since then, I've been a total mess for top-quality Chocolate Mousse. And Marais' Mousse is the bomb!Striking dark woods on the outside, large windows, tin-ceiling, woods continue- inside along with French Moulin Rouge-esque posters- giving you an old-fashioned feel with an odd but cool Rat-Packish vibe. There are two sides to this story: butcher shop on the left- heading in and dining area a bit back. Ms. Manager was pleasant and sat me in a small round table- all by myself (which I liked). Asked her about any mocktails and recommended an iced 'Raspberry Zinger' topped with Blueberries.Le Marais has been my on-again, off-again fix and my very own lustification. Their dessert menu is notoriously great all around. In the past, I'd come here just for their Chocolate Mousse. But I was a bit hungry this time and settled on the Rare Chili-Crusted Tuna Appetizer that was substantial and tasty. Service was polite and Lia(?), was a doll during my short afternoon stay.It would be senseless to just mention their pride and joy (steak) and not mention their Desserts and rich Chocolate Mousse. But I'm so sure Marais is doing something damn right with their French-Kosher menu if they've been around this long. What I can sincerely tell you is- Marais is nothing short of classiness and pulls out all the stops with their Mousse (and I'm sure everything else). Prices aren't outrageous for this type of place and the thing to order is everything- if that's how you wanna go.

Chocolate cake and ice cream: amazing lava cake, warm melted Center, berries that came with it were very fresh. Duck frisée salad: best part about the salad was the duck itself. The dressing (kinda tasted like balsamic vinaigrette) was overpowering and not needed for something that already has so much flavor. Sliders: bread and the pickle that came with this was the best part. The meat was alright. Cote de beouf for two: I didn't really find this amazing, and for a steakhouse that's known for its meat, I thought it was a bit disappointing that the best parts of our meal had to do with the bread and dessert. Cocktails: i'd stay away. Really not shaken at all, and the French 75 was on their cocktail list. I'd stick with neat alcohol or wine. Service was very friendly and timely. Cute old school nyc vibes.

I calmy asked the bartender how much is each individual empanada. She replied $4 each for a total of $8. I said that's fine, please charge me for the beer and the empanadas. The bartender that I should  be charged for the special because that's what I ordered. I told her then and I told her again, I don't want a second drink. I'm happy to pay for the full price of my drink and the empanadas, for a total of $15. Nope, she said I had to pay for a second beer that wasn't served to me, because THAT'S HOW SHE PUT IT IN THE COMPUTER.  It escalated until I eventually paid for my beer and tip and walked out. They have one of those silly signs that the bartender is always right, but this is the first place I've been to, where they actually mean it. Don't go here, unless you want to pay for drinks that you don't get served."

Nice place to grab a drink with friends or with a date. Subway station nearby and I'll definitely continue coming back.
1086,BuoZEYr6Y8o_fX2xs060SA,9/28/2018,1 star rating,"Ordered 1 burger with fries through grubhub and after an hour and a half of waiting for my delivery, I called the restaurant to see where my food was at. Constant ringing and no answer. I called grubhub and they said the driver was telling me 10 more minutes before it's done. Since when does it take 1 hour and 40 minutes to cook a burger? Wouldn't know how it tasted since I had to cancel because I have to go to work."
1087,BuoZEYr6Y8o_fX2xs060SA,1/9/2019,1 star rating,I would give this place a zero stars if I could. Ordered two Sam Adams. Menu says $5 each but we were charged $12. Bartender said that the owner said it was $6 tonight. I call bullshit. First stop bar and grill is more like first and last time bar and grill. Adios.
1088,BuoZEYr6Y8o_fX2xs060SA,1/20/2019,1 star rating,"Everything about this bar is just below average. It's really a shame because LIC needs a decent sports bar. The owner really missed the boat in everything he is going for. It's half sports bar, half Latin disco, half dive bar... regardless of how you would classify it, everything is just bad. No one on the staff knows how to make a drink. The shot glasses are so small I would estimate three shots here are equivalent to one at any other bar. Staff barely speaks English. The food reminds me of what would be served at a free outdoor bbq event put on by the local town council. They have no beers on tap- just bottles with varying expiration dates (go for the Coronas, they seem to move the fastest). All of this makes it just a sub par place, but the thing that really destroys the place is the super creepy owner. Always parading out Spanish girls wearing next to nothing and speaking about one word of English. Owner spends his time walking around, kissing, touching, whispering, etc. Really none of my business but is distractingly uncomfortable to just sit at the bar with this guy prowling around. Hopefully he loses the lease and a real sports bar will come in."

For the second time in a row, our delivery arrived without any of the sauces (tahini, charif, etc.), which are an important part of the meal. After the first time this happened, the owner (Benji) apologized and agreed to provide something complimentary on our next order. That was decent. We just received our second order and the samething happened. I just called and spoke to a fellow named Avi who was unapologetic and only offered to take the price of the rice off the order. When I explained that I wanted the sauces for eating the rest of the food, he was fairly curt and wouldn't even consider trying to deliver the sauces. Very weak. Sadly, this is fairly typical of kosher restaurants -- even when the food is pretty good, the service isn't."

Made fresh, tons of veggies to choose from, and all different kinds of sauces that you can put on it.  You can get white or whole wheat pita. Veggies include- cucumber-tomato mix, beets, carrots, lettuce, quinoa, onions, eggplant, corn mix, etc. You can have hummus and fries inside your pita or not. Sauces include- tahini, garlic, BBQ, mango, sweet chili, etc. I have also tried their teriyaki chicken and chicken shawarma which are good too.The price is average, and one pita is huge. Its a casual place for eat in or take out."

You'll get one that's about twice the size!While waiting for a meeting at YU, the boyfriend and I asked friends on Twitter where to go and this Israeli grill got several mentions, so we decided to give it a go. Luckily, we arrived just before the peak lunch time, so we got our food, a seat, and got to enjoy it before the real crowd showed up (and boy was there a crowd!). I ordered the falafel on laffa (falafalaffa), not knowing how gigantic it would come. I got the regular chips and chummus, and threw on tahini, Israeli salad, pickles, and some spicy sauce. They wrapped it, threw it into some foil, chopped it in half, and served it up. I only ate half of it because it was, well, HUGE. But it was so, so tasty. A serious nosh of a serious Israeli kind. It reminded me of eating falafel on the streets in Israel, and that was such a comfort. The boyfriend got his very first schwarma with chips, and although I want him to write his own review, he scarfed that thing down without thinking about it. And? He loved it.The crew here is quick, attentive, and knows how to run a busy business. Most importantly? They know how to keep all the Yeshiva boys in check when they're crowding the counter. The prices aren't great, but I really can't bring myself to complain when it comes to kosher food. My falafalaffa ran $9, if that gives you any idea. Bravo Golan. I just wish there was a joint like this in Connecticut! Rest assured, we'll be back."

1099,9uIP33w6K4k1Qh7lxnVSHw,11/17/2016,1 star rating,Always loved the food here but the way I was treated by person behind the register is just so unprofessional and was so shocking. I called them asking if I can make an order for pickup on the phone since I know parking is very difficult in their area. When I told him what I wanted to order he said that food is ready and doesn't need to be prepared so it's not worth his time for me to order it on the phone and immediately hung up on me. I called back stating that I eat there at least once a week and that I would pay over the phone since I'm just trying to avoid getting a parking ticket since there's no parking. In typical kosher service he told me to go somewhere else. Food is good but you can treat customers like that.

1101,3gbN7EcImU1Ltf4XkWoSeg,8/4/2019,4 star rating,"Will definitely come back and try their famous brown sugar bubble tea, but for now I wanted something light so I stuck with fruit drinks. When ordering you can customize the sugar level (less sugar) and ice level. I went with the Pineapple green tea. Despite ordering it with less sugar, the drink was sweet enough and had pleasant after taste. Surprisingly you can taste both - pineapple and green tea. The Green tea flavor was more pronounced when you initially take a sip followed by the fruity pineapple flavor. There's also small pineapple chunks at the bottom. Price -Fruit - 5 for a small, 5.50 for a large Clean, quick service. I lucked out and went during a period in the afternoon with no lines and was able to get seats."

Small space with a few bar stools in an L shape lined against the wall and a few facing the window, just up a few steps of stairs on the side street of 58 street.  I can imagine when it gets crowded... Again, I came to try the Brown Sugar Boba Milk Latte... and again, left disappointed with a over-cooked boba drink. The boba was way too soft and gloppy... not sure why it is.  I hope these franchise branches eventually gets it right."
1103,3gbN7EcImU1Ltf4XkWoSeg,6/27/2019,2 star rating,"I came here on a Sunday night to try their brown sugar pearl latte. Most of my co-workers who had it raved about how good it was so might as well try it. The cashier who took my order was very nice. When I got my drink, I shook it until I believe the brown sugar was fully mixed with the milk. I had a difficult time poking my straw in because the cover was rougher than I expected. When I took a sip, all I drank was milk. I didn't taste the brown sugar. I thought I shook it wrong so I started mixing the drink with my straw. When I drank for the second time, it was nothing but the sweetness of brown sugar and bubble in my mouth. When I chewed on the bubbles it was so soft. It was like chewing on porridge. Don't really like their bubbles. It was disgusting. Sorry. Second time coming here I decided to get something without milk. I heard their signature fruit tea was good so I gave that a try. As I was ordering, I asked the cashier if I can get 70% sugar. She said ""we put 30%"". I explained ""but I want 70%"". She said ""but most people get 30% and its preferred 30%"". UMMMMM.... last time I checked, I was the customer and I like my drinks a little sweeter. I ended up just getting 30% sugar. When I took a sip, the drink was too sour for me. Not for my taste."
1104,3gbN7EcImU1Ltf4XkWoSeg,6/2/2019,3 star rating,"REALLY REALLY LONG LINE... probably because they just open.The drink is very average but the service is good.Just a few suggestions:- maybe put up a glass window between the area where you cook the bubbles and waiting/seating. customers. customers can probably get burn and also if there are terrorist, they might throw something into the pot and poisoned everyone.- change the freaking cover lid on the cup..... the straws are not strong enough to punch throw the lid, but it causes a small opening and the liquid start pouring out... almost had to go clean my car because of the liquid spilling."

Recommendations: - Oolong with salty cream ( no sugar) - green or black tea with salty cream ( with sugar ) I haven't tried the mountain tea with salty cream yet, that will be the next one.

They only have 2 people but they are slow. The brown sugar bubble tea is good the tapioca is soft like tiger sugar only difference is tiger sugar's drink is creamier and stronger tea flavor this has a lighter not so strong tea flavor but still good I usually get this or tiger sugar for the brown sugar bubble tea. If you don't want to wait long I would go with tiger sugar since they have more people working there, even though there is a line, they are quick to get your orders ready!"

That is a big NONO for me because I have diabetes running on both sides of my family and I am an AVID 30% sugar gal. I ultimately ended up sharing my drink with my boyfriend but omg, please make it adjustable!!2) SO expensive! One order of the brown sugar drink is 6-7 dollars and for $7, you can literally buy a lunch in the same neighborhood. Highly recommend whoever is in the area to try it out if you are a fan of sweet drinks. Definitely a splurge and not an everyday purchase."

Initially we were gonna go to the drive through, but someone that lived in the area said it was extremely slow, so I opted to go in. Although there were a few people in there, it seems like it took FOREVER to get my food! Once the people that were ahead of me got there food, it seems like the manager completely forgot about me waiting for my food and jumped on the cash register to take more orders. All I ordered was a simple fries and nuggets and it took a long time to receive. As far as the place, to be honest it seemed a little dirty to me. There was a kids play house here which was cool; I didn't get a chance to try the restroom. The staff was nice and friendly, but I don't think I would be back.

The workers make sure that the food is cooked to perfection. Definitely worth the wait. It is best to call ahead for large orders. However I recommend this spot for some good food
1148,p7AK3xaLGgyG1jYP8kSzNw,3/29/2018,4 star rating,Chicken could be a little salty but fish is spot on. Being open late is a hugh plus when you're hungry and looking for something good and nearby to eat. Would be better still if they delivered.
1149,p7AK3xaLGgyG1jYP8kSzNw,8/8/2017,5 star rating,The only business since romeos pizza that has been successful in this location. The food is delicious I highly recommend the whiting fish and biryani rice full of flavor. Being a broke college student you cannot go wrong with the price and it's halal. Perfect for when I'm too lazy to cook
1150,p7AK3xaLGgyG1jYP8kSzNw,3/6/2018,5 star rating,The food here is amazing! I got the Philly cheese steak with fries and a soda. My meal was hot and fresh.
1151,FJFliqqHXFZutkp_dmWdfw,4/20/2023,4 star rating,Great service and good food. Great place to come late night with some friends. It's very dim and loud inside but that's what you expect from a 술집. The waiters kept checking on us to make sure we had everything and provided the steamed eggs on the house. I highly recommend the army stew!
1152,FJFliqqHXFZutkp_dmWdfw,12/23/2022,4 star rating,"Came on a Saturday night expecting a wait but we were seated almost immediately. They have indoor and outdoor seating available! Before entering the restaurant, someone will check for IDs. They serve large portions - highly recommend ordering dishes to share for the table. We ordered the Budae Jeongol (Army Stew), tofu and kimchi with pork, and spicy chicken.The Budae Jeongol was perfect for the chilly night. A bit more tomatoey from the mature kimchi. They also give tables a complimentary steamed egg, great to balance out from the spicier dishes."
1153,FJFliqqHXFZutkp_dmWdfw,1/27/2023,5 star rating,Very nice Korean restaurant / bar. Came here a few times and enjoyed it every time. Good lychee martinis. Friendly staff. Complimentary steamed egg. What more to ask for? Will come back again next time.
1154,FJFliqqHXFZutkp_dmWdfw,9/26/2022,5 star rating,"This is one of my favorite places in ktown. The service here is amazing; everyone treats you so well and they go above and beyond. There's both indoor (down the stairs/basement vibes) and outdoor seating, but I definitely preferred inside as the decorations reminded me of Korea. The food is a little pricey but that's because the portion sizes are pretty big here! So definitely come with couple of friends, b/c that also makes it more fun too!! 5/5 service, food, and ambiance."
1155,FJFliqqHXFZutkp_dmWdfw,8/5/2022,4 star rating,"Bangia's one of my go-to K-Town spots, especially when Pocha's packed. It's a great choice whether you're going for dinner or drinks and late-night grub.I'm a big fan of their budae jjigae (though I think I still prefer Pocha's), and spicy seafood cheese ddukbokki. The chicken gizzards are tasty, if you can actually find them buried under all the onions and peppers. The corn cheese pancake was okay, but it was so loaded that it had no crispy edges, and my friend hated that the sauce just tasted like Tabasco. I enjoyed the pancakes more after dunking each piece in ddukbokki sauce, but I probably wouldn't get it again. The portions are pretty massive and meant for family-style sharing, so come hungry. And enjoy the complimentary steamed egg, which is one of my favorite Korean side dishes and such a treat.I've tried a few of their one-liter cocktails, and the lychee and yogurt sojus reign supreme. The former actually comes with an additional cup filled with lychees, which is as glorious as it sounds. The yuzu and coconut cream makgeollis are still fine, slightly thicker and milkier, but they're not as refreshingly satisfying."
1156,FJFliqqHXFZutkp_dmWdfw,9/4/2022,4 star rating,"3.5! Came here for a casual dinner with two friends, on a weekday a little after opening. The interior has a pocha type vibe with a good amount of tables and not being too cramped. We ordered the jokbal, the corn cheese pancake, and an army stew to share. The jokbal looked like a lot, but a lot of it was bones. Nevertheless, it was marinated deliciously and went well in the lettuce wraps. The corn cheese pancake was pretty ok, just how you would imagine it to taste like. Wish it was maybe a little more crispy on the bottom. The army stew was also typical, nothing crazy to mention there. All in all, I probably would not crave to come here, but would gladly visit if a friend had Korean comfort food cravings in Manhattan."
1157,FJFliqqHXFZutkp_dmWdfw,9/29/2022,4 star rating,"Bangia? Or did you mean PANGEA because my plates definitely shifted--around the table, as I tried to grab a bite of chicken gizzards. Those things were so tasty with the onions & other assorted vegetables. I barely remember my night here because I think my group and I had like 7 too many soju bottles. Those things creep up on you...FAST. My face was as red as the bulgogi tteok-bokki by the end of the meal (which I think was called the marinated beef bulgogi rice platter on the menu?) And to wrap it all together, the warmth and comfort that the spicy fish cake soup brought, gave my life meaning again after drowning out my sorrows with so much alcohol.Our server was so attentive constantly switching out our water container (and definitely kept the soju rolling.) It was such an awesome time that I forgot the bill had to come and then I was sad all over again. Also totally knocked off a star from the complete lack of space in the restaurant and how dim it was. My legs were CRAMPING by the time I stood up. Aside from that, Bangia is a must visit in K-Town and is an overall great time and experience!"
1158,FJFliqqHXFZutkp_dmWdfw,6/27/2022,2 star rating,"Honestly the food isn't bad but the prices are soo steep that it's really not worth your time. All their food items are basically shareables and roughly $30 per dish. There's basically nothing you can get under $25 so it was tough eating for 2 people. FOOD:-spicy pork belly stone pot fried rice - honestly it was like a kimchi fried rice. Nothing special but it was almost $30 for the most shallow ""stone pot."" It was actually shocking how little rice you got. I thought surely that little plate must be deeper than it was.... I was wrong. ALSO, they charge $2 extra for mozzarella cheese and you BARELY get any cheese. Like what??? -spicy sweet wings -- the wings sauce was strong and the flavor wasn't horrible but it was very intensely sweet spicy. I didn't love it and it was kinda too pungent for my taste. Again, nothing special that I would die for again. This place is usually packed, but you can scan a QR code to put yourself on the waiting list. We got lucky and didn't have to wait but I wouldn't recommend or come back here."
1159,FJFliqqHXFZutkp_dmWdfw,8/28/2022,5 star rating,"So first of all let me start by saying that the food here is amazing, it was my first time here and I had to leave due to a family emergency and didn't get to finish my meal but the staff were very accommodating and helped me get out the door fast. I got the spicy seafood and cheese tteokbokki like most people recommended and it was AMAZING. Just the right combo of spicy to flavor and on top of that it was HUGE, if you read any of my other reviews I always complain about the price to portion ratio at restaurants but this place did it just right. I had zero complaints from service (the other patrons that looked to be regulars were very happy to see the man working the outside booth and he was very welcoming.) to the quality and taste of the food. I will absolutely be back here as soon as possible to finish my meal."
1160,FJFliqqHXFZutkp_dmWdfw,12/14/2022,4 star rating,"Came here on Saturday evening with a couple of friends after one of them recommended this place. The word that comes to mind when I think of this place is flavor. My friends and I got a variety of dishes to try such as the bulgogi which was so tender and flavorful. The sauce was so good that I kept going back for it. The army stew was also so flavorful. I loved the mix of all the different meats and the sausage especially was a highlight. It wasn't too spicy on the palate which I appreciated. The corn cheese pancake was also good though and pretty unique.The service itself was a bit slow. It took a while for us to have a server approach our table and they not only brought our soju after food had been delivered, they brought the wrong one. Even when we informed them that they brought the wrong soju, they forgot and it took 10+ minutes to get a new one.But I'd recommend this place on a less busy time, the food is expensive but worth it!"

On this most recent occasion however , I wanted to write it to remind myself of how ordinary their cake is . I ended up getting two cupcakes on my last visit . Red velvet and blackout . At the blackout almost immediately and thought it sucked . The cake erred on the dry side than the moist side . It was also too sugary and sweet whilst offering little depth in savoriness . The frosting tasted cheap and just not suitable for that area . Gave away the red velvet cupcake as I had enough foreshadowed to know what was coming ."
1164,OtqShhp-cOByPzzdTMZu6w,12/31/2022,5 star rating,"I wish I could give more than 5 stars just for the great service experience. I recently ordered and picked up a 9 inch Brooklyn Blackout cake and a dozen vegan red velvet cupcakes. De-licous! Gorgeous presentation of the cake, truly a masterpiece. The fudge layers were a hit. Everyone hates this word but every cupcake and cake bite was perfectly MOIST. Non vegans were like, ""these are vegan?!"" They also threw in a couple of vegan gluten free cupcakes because two of the red velvets disappeared from my order before I got there, which was totally understandable. Delicious things happen when cupcakes are around. They also had some big cookies by the register so I bought some of those as well. All in all, I'm very pleased with my overall experience and look forward to going back in the future."

This one star (I'd give minus stars if I could) is for the workers with bad attitude behind the counter. My friend was visiting from out of town and we thought this was a cute place to try out. How wrong we were! The girl who took our order looked like we were taking up her time and her demeanor was one of rushing and annoyed. When my friend added a cookie, she looked like she wanted to strangle us. Then the barista was rude when I asked if one of the 3 cappuccino's that she announced was mine. She curtly replied ""I will be with you in a second"" I found it laughable the amount of rudeness from these two since it was so unnecessary. I don't remember the cupcake nor the cappuccino because we were so put off by their attitude. I will take my business elsewhere and my recommendations! They need to chill!"

Dry, disgustingly sweet, tasted nothing like tiramisu. I ate a few bites and tossed it. My friend had a cheesecake and that was good, but I still don't trust going back to this place."
1167,OtqShhp-cOByPzzdTMZu6w,2/9/2022,4 star rating,"Try the peanut butter cookie! If this place didn't exude enough adorable coziness, surely you'll get your fill of it with that crunchy-on-the-outside, soft-and-dense-on-the-inside PB goodness. I think it has peanut butter chips in it, which were so soft and melty. It's hard to get the salty/sweet balance down in a peanut butter cookie, and they totally nailed it!I also had the hot chocolate with oat milk. It was fine - could have been hotter - but I look forward to trying their coffee or hot cider next time. Though I didn't try a cupcake this time, the display is clean, orderly, and pretty. Whoever does the decorating here is doing a great job!"

The Brooklyn Blackout and Dreaming Princess are some of the best slices of cake you'll ever have, and the banana pudding and Pistachio icebox cake are also sublime. Almost all of the others are also very good, although I don't care all that much for their cupcakes, which are good but not exceptional. Lastly: the slices are HUGE. One slice is enough for 4 servings (or two people who are very hungry)."

This Bakeshop, made famous by Sex in the City holds its own without the hype. The cakes are moist and rich in flavor; the icing delicious without being super sugary. There are always a lot of cakes to choose from and flavors of cupcakes. Love the vanilla with salted caramel icing, such a treat!There is typically a line and most of the cafe tables inside occupied as they are located in a very lively intersection with Madewell next door and a fab pizza shop across the street.

I assumed pickups for door dash was on the pickup window, in which the counter lady on pickups ignored me for at least 10 minutes. Other people on line were also getting upset as their orders were not being taken. Finally the manager came out when one of the customers complained about standing around and not having their orders taken. The manager proceeded to argue with multiple customers and did not help assisting his coworkers or take charge of the situation. I had a small argument about where my order was and he proceeded to send me back of the line to have my door dash order processed, while still yelling across the counter. He wouldn't let it go until he had the last word. It's obvious the manager hates his job, and would just like to sit in his small room to the left while watching his crew struggle with no direction."

I thought that was impossible considering its a chain restaurant. This location was boarded up for some months, I thought that might be great, they'll remodel and come back stronger. I was wrong! Just last week I went in for some fries for my daughter. Reminder I said just a small fry. This took at least 10 mins, because the staff is unorganized and they had no fries ready with 10 patrons in line and 6 customers sitting at tables. The fries were a dark brown color. And taste disgusting. Actually they always have from this location. I elite e they cut corners with meal preparation. No changing the fry oil daily. I will not ever go back to this location, I tried to give them a chance. I will continue to go out of my way to McDonalds on Flatlands and Farragut.

It is currently closed down and boarded up as well as the other location near Seaview Ave. When it was opened it had to have been the slowest Mc Donald's I ever been to. I would only go in when there was no line. Unfortunately that was hardly ever. This place always had the longest lines which seemed to never move.Currently there are no Mc Donald's in Canarsie which I know of. That is unbelievable considering how popular Mc Donald's restaurants are. I suspect the two former locations were owned by the same person. How a Mc Donald's closes down in the first place is mind boggling. A billion burgers sold?, apparently not here. Nothing lasts forever."

I took away a star since the restaurant currently does not offer drinks but I know everyone has had to scale back. Our meals were great though and my pad Thai was such a large portion that I got half of it to go. It seems that a lot of their business is done for delivery.

What sets BKK away from the many other Thai restaurants in NYC are its lavishly floral accents, creating the illusion of dining in a garden of fresh blooms and greenery. The menu doesn't have too many surprises so I decided to order Shrimp Pad Kee Mao with mild spice. My first bite was surprising, A. Because it definitely DID NOT taste like mild spice and B. Because the noodles were so flavorful and perfectly chewy. I loved every bite (except when the spice became too overwhelming) and was very satisfied by the time I cleaned my plate. They have a lunch special deal where you can order a main for only $11.95! I'd love to come back for another lovely dinner and have no doubt I'd be just as amazed with the charming ambiance and delicious food."

I ended up ordering the Thai Iced Tea, spring rolls, and Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles) with chicken. Honestly the iced tea was a bit too sweet for my tastes, but then again it usually is no matter where I go. The spring rolls were good, although I would have preferred for the plum sauce to be on the side rather than served directly on the spring rolls. I really enjoyed the drunken noodles though. The portion size was perfect and it had plenty of fresh, crisp vegetables. I like spicy food, so I was happy when it actually was spicy (of note, I asked for it to be spicier than usual).The decor is really unique, with an almost tropical feel. I can imagine it being popular on Instagram.Definitely worth checking out for lunch if you live or work nearby!"

It's flavorful, noodles are cooked perfectly, and not overly salty or sweet. Service is friendly and welcoming, and prices are super reasonable. Glad I discovered a delicious, authentic Thai place around the corner (although I've been living nearby for 1.5 years). The mango sticky rice is also quite unique and tasty. The rice has a beautiful violet color, which is from a flower they infuse the rice in. I thought it was butterfly pea flower as I've seen another Thai restaurant use it in their cocktails and tea, but the waitress said it was something else (that I can't recall)."

The fries were hard and tasted like cardboard. The grilled cheese was such poor quality I could not even stomach it. $23 for a fake french onion soup and inedible grilled cheese and fries was not worth it. the included ""garlic bread"" was a hamburger bun which seemed to have no garlic whatsoever. I have had better food from a high school cafeteria. Do not waste your time or money ordering from here, it is not worth it. never again..."

All the bar tenders there will treat you like a regular even if you have never been there.Remember - this is a pub/bar so if your looking for fancy cocktail atmosphere - don't go in. However something that you always hear at the bar is laughter. Yes, real laughter. There is an eclectic mix of people of all types. All laughing and just there to drink and socialize. The bar has the feel of a neighborhood pub and that unique blend of ""Cheers"" meets a dive bar in Ireland.Good bar food, cheap drinks and friendly service.

The quality of food here is excellent, though I suppose it can get a little pricey. I've only had dinner here so can't comment on lunch/brunch. The ambiance is beautiful especially around Christmas and located in the ""basement"", it really is a cellar atmosphere. My favorite dish is the mushroom garganelli which even the pickiest eaters enjoyed. I've also had the chicken caesar salad as well which although is simple, was delicious. The patatas bravas were crazy good. The only dish I don't recommend is the grilled chicken which was very thin and very overpriced. Their coconut caramel cappuccino is amazing but I like both of those flavors. They have a wide range of coffees to choose from. Service has always been good  and attentive for the most part."

Light and fluffy and not so heavy compared to other breads, with lettuce tomato avocado mousse and chipotle aioli.

I opted for brown rice as my base, ropa vieja as my protein, beans and plantain as my 2 toppings and also added sweet corn as an additional topping.

I wanted something simple and ordered a regular white corn arepa and the yuca croquettes. The arepa was pretty basic. The cheese wasn't completely melted. The yuca croquettes were nicely fried however it was pretty bland. I expected it to be gooey with cheese. But I was able to salvage it by using my own salsa rather than the garlic sauce they provided. I will likely return and maybe try their arepa with their protein and toppings.

You can see / taste the pizza's peeled tomatoes drizzled with homemade pesto sauce and mozzarella cheese being worth every dollar spent to have it in your possession!  Each ingredient was seen and enjoyed, of course, with the sprinkling of red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese.From the first time to this present day, Piz-zetta Pizza has not changed their ingredient taste complexity and you are able to CHOOSE your particular pizza slice of heaven.  It is something special about having the opportunity to point to your margarita slice(s) for immediate consumption!Once you have had the best, there is no need to try the rest.  What an experience of monumental proportions with a margarita pizza slice or two ( 2 ) from Piz-zetta Pizza."

Although I waited a while in the Pizzeria, I saw the pie being made in front of me and being loaded inside the box. 8 slices comprised the rectangular pie. It was slightly smaller than other grandma pies I've seen in the past. Almost more elegant too?! The crust was thin and crispy yet chewy. Light with an appropriate amount of cheese without being a heavy monstrosity. The tangy sauce above the cheese (signature difference of a grandma pie from a traditional pie) was tangy and sweet. Since I waited maybe 10-15mins for the pie, the person working gave me a couple of chocolate chip cookies for my trouble. Great service and great pizza in NYC!"

I got a grandma square this time and it was absolutely  delicious. Corner were crispy and dough was chewy and soft. Tomato sauce was right on point on sweetness and acidity. Lots of gooey cheese and a drizzle of pesto. I do wish they would add some basil but otherwise a perfect piece of square pizza. I will definitely be coming back and hopefully they will have the grandpa this time. Oh! And their prices aren't too crazy. Another plus for this place."

I understand it is a Friday night but because the great kills location was not answering their phone, I decided to make my way to this one. Normally great kills location has the order ready in 20 minutes MAX - I have never had an issue here. At this location, I got there about 20 minutes after i placed my order knowing that it is a Friday night and that it'll probably be hectic. I was told to wait a few minutes. I wait almost 10 minutes and then decide to ask when the order will be ready. They inform me that it'll be another 15 minutes minimum for my order to be ready. I could've just asked for delivery or went elsewhere in that time frame. I understand businesses are taking on a lot to compensate for the lost time during the pandemic, however, any kind of warning would have been appreciated (because some restaurants have done that for me recently). People kept piling in with various pickup orders and were also baffled by this wait time. I think waiting nearly an hour (50ish minutes) after calling for a PICKUP order is completely ridiculous, let alone without a warning.Oh and keep in mind I ordered dinner for 1 person (2 rolls, a hand roll and a kani salad)"

1284,kTKmoQ8h5LZILeOk36x7dA,6/2/2018,5 star rating,"Red Panda is run by some of the guys who used to run Tawa Food in Jackson Heights. Back in those days, Tawa was my favorite place to eat in Queens. Now that the management has moved here, Red Panda has become my favorite place to eat in Queens. Thali and momo feature prominently on the menu, and both are out of this world. Every night the thali includes a slightly different variety of dishes and achar (pickles), so I definitely recommend returning to sample the full spectrum of flavors. We usually order the veggie thali, but we also enjoy the chicken thali from time to time (usually, momo is enough meat for us, but YMMV). The nice thing about the meaty thalis is that they also come with a separate bowl of spicy broth, which goes deliciously well over the rice. If you're feeling adventurous, try the bhutan thali, which comes with an assortment of meat stuff that I can't quite put my finger on, but tastes great regardless. The momo is incredible as well: moist and tender, and redolent of warm spices. We recommend the chicken momo first and foremost, but the vegetable momo is pretty dang good as well. They're served with three different chutneys, and you must try them all. For yet another variety of chutney, order jhol momo, which is basically momo served in a pool of delicious sauce. They're open late, and for a reason - it's not unusual that I walk in at 10pm and find half the tables taken. I love that one of my favorite restaurants is one that is open till midnight. Service is friendly, though english is understood only sparsely. In short, if you're interested in Himalayan food, this might be one of the best, if not the best, place in the city to enjoy it. We visit on a very regular weekly cadence, so maybe we'll see each other there? A note for those who are accustomed to having a drink with dinner: I don't drink, but they don't have alcohol on the menu. Usually, folks seem to order the mango lassi, sweet tea (chai, basically), and/or the butter tea."

U should try their Tibetan butter tea or the lemon tea with  extra limes. For dinner we had a selection of thalis, dhedo n roti. I had the veg thali with roti. The rating for the veg thali would be 2/5. I noticed that all the items in the veg thali except for the roti were similar to the other thalis.

1293,kTKmoQ8h5LZILeOk36x7dA,3/23/2018,5 star rating,"This review is long overdue and I owe it to the owners to tell you why you should come here over all other Nepalese restaurants in Jackson Heights/Woodside. They have the best chicken momo even compared to Tawa and Lali Guras, they have better service and seating, and still better food overall (thali, choila, sel roti are my favorites other than the momo). When I give 5 stars sometimes I know I'm being a little over eager but in this case I can't imagine a universe in which I would give them anything less. I love Nepalese food more than any cuisine - at times it is what makes Queens the best place to live - and Red Panda is definitely my favorite. The people who run Red Panda used to work at Tawa for a period of time in 2017 and possibly earlier (it's hard to remember). I had no idea where they went when they left Tawa and although I still was going to Tawa regularly I missed some of the recipes that were unique - especially the chicken momo. I actually went to Red Panda by accident thinking I was going to the restaurant that was previously here - Bhutanese Ema Datsi. I went in expecting Bhutanese food and then I recognized the face of one of the people who used to work at Tawa and it became clear they had moved HERE. Then I saw the menu and Red Panda became the name of my long lost favorite restaurant.Just to give you an idea of why the people here are so great - one time at Tawa (when they used to work there) the server gave my girlfriend and I each a chicken drumstick (which you can only order on the catering menu) on the house. It was the BEST fried chicken / drumstick / chicken on a stick / spicy chicken wing I had ever had and the only other place I could find it was (quite absurdly) Bhutanese Ema Datsi (the restaurant here before Red Panda) - which now come to think of it I very much miss and wonder where those people went.Upon reflection I have realized I may need to move to Nepal or Bhutan, learn enough of the languages to communicate, and finally properly understand and appreciate the most incredible food on the planet. For now Queens will do."

Well, at least, this scares me from trying non yelp approved mexican food in the future. I decided to try the nearby Taqueria Guadalupe when I was offered a $10 off order from Grubhub. The meal was... mushy. The mushroom quesadilla had well cooked mushrooms. However, the cheese was far from anything that could be called queso. It was not zesty or sharp. It's not really fair to comment on the crispyness of the tortilla because it was not eaten when right off the stove. When I got it, it was... mushy.  The salad it came with was standard. Shockingly, the guacamole was watery! How is this even possible? I can only think it was somehow reconstituted from guacamole powder or preserved. It also needed cilantro and lime.The burrito was absolutely a mess. The veggies were mushy and unspiced. I would not be surprised to find that these veggies were originally frozen. No char marks or crispyness was left in them. I had to remove them just to finish the burrito. The rice was overcooked and, again, mushy. The bean to rice ratio was so low I could not even remark on the taste of the bean. Finally, the same cheese was used in the burrito as the quesadilla.I hate to give a place such a scathing review. The saving graces were the speed of getting my order ready and the red salsa."

Nine times outta 10, I can make the dish I just ordered BETTER than the Restaurants kitchen did!!Saturday night; We expect a good experience.  We get seated by a doll of a hostess (who had a tan I would kill for). Three minutes later, we get shuffled to a smaller table in the very center of the restaurant.  I felt like I was going to be putting on a show for the night; very uncomfortable.  Regardless...We were offered no specials.  I don't know if they 86'ed them by the time we showed up (our reservation was 7:30pm) or if they simply had a night without, but whatever.  We ordered the ""B.R. Burrata"" to share, the man ordered ""Chicken Scarpariello"" and I ordered ""Pan Seared Cod Marrichetta"".Serving time was impeccable. Plating was beautiful.The ""B.R. Burrata"" was completely flavorless.  The lump of cold Burrata in the center didn't ""split"".  It needed to be cut or spooned into pieces.  The surrounding pieces of fried aubergine we're just as bland.  The breadcrumb mixture used to coat the pieces tasted season-less.  The nuts and raisins were nice; I like nuts and raisins.  But... Why is it in this dish? The Man's ""Chicken Scarpariello"" he enjoyed and I tried a piece as well.  It was flavorful; Savory, spicy and very well seasoned.  Bravo, Tommy!My ""Pan Seared Cod Marrichetta"" - disastrous.  Cod was dry, sauce was too watery (so I couldn't take advantage of it's flavor because I couldn't coat my Cod pieces in it).  I think I ate about a quarter of the Cod and said ""I wanna go home"".  Our waitress was so overwhelmed with others that, after 10 minutes, we had to nag another person to get our check. I came home and had Ramen. I might give it another try one day but this place is a hyped up pizzeria-dinette that sells stereotypical pizzeria Entrées and no Pizza. ‍ Meh... Whatdoyawantmetahdo?"

The ziti with Sunday sauce followed quickly thereafter. ( enough to feed 5 easily). Service was friendly, prompt and knowledgeable. Not over bearing, no rush.

The owner (as recognized on the website) was visible in the eating area although only spoke with one table.

The cocktails are delicious. My only concern, and not everyone will feel this way, is that because it's a small space the tables were on top of one another (not ideal for those still concerned about the recent pandemic and variants currently circulating). Luckily we sat toward the front where the door was so there was a bit more air circulating in that section. Overall it was a great experience with great food and service, so I no complaints and would definitely recommend checking it out for yourself!"

Attended their most recent Vegan Shop-up event which seems to be very popular due to the lines for some of the vendors selling food.My first impression of the place was that of a gothic/rock bar with skulls and coffins décor around the place.  Their drinks, specifically the bloody Mary, appear popular as that is what most visitors were drinking.  The place was bigger than anticipated with enough elbow room to roam throughout the space.  The music was good, pretty much rocking and rolling...lol.So happy to see that they're a dog-friendly establishment, many locals had their four legged pups with them which really gravitates to me, as I'm a dog lover.The vendors taking part on the vegan shop-up event mostly consisted of prepared food, which made my belly very happy.  Tried two different selections of soft shell tacos by Vegicano, which I didn't want to share with my boo, who was practically salivating for it.  We also noshed on risotto sliders by Risotto Burger, and that was just as delicious as I imagined.  No wonder the lines and wait for the food is long, because it really is worth the wait!I look forward to attending their next shop-up to wash down the delicious food with Pine box's popular bloody Mary :)."

The space has been here since before the huge Bushwick migration. And I have always had a weakness for a rock n roll bar. This recent summer my friend who's vegan me to the vegan empanadas! Wow! They are simple, quick, filling and delicious! I have yet to be disappointed. I normally pick between the black bean and the Philly Cheesesteak mushroom. And another bonus in the summer is the front patio. A playground to meet new locals, boozehounds and musicians (who are most likely playing a show in the back venue). Some nights it's a little too crazy for my liking. Can a bar help but be popular amongst the locals? I recently popped in on a Sunday and it was just my speed. Then I noticed my adorable, uber pregnant bartender still on a step stool writing down the beer menu. Commitment. The lively coffin nail earrings were really up my alley. Turns out Heather is also one of the owners. She was extremely sweet and genuine. She was knew all her regulars, the cutest one being a corgi mix named Fonz! Dog bar = rad bar! I'm always in better spirits when happy puppies are running around.I love supporting a small business that fills the rocker, goth, vegan void in my life! And those closer the the M Central Ave are in luck, their sister bar Precious Metal is also open!PBRNS also hosts Walking Dead viewing in Sunday's and a Vegan Pop Up Shop! And last but not least, you have to check it the mural from local artist Grace Lang!"

Total: $30 spent on what will be a full weekend of deliciousness.*only subtracted one star because I didn't get a chance to sample anything from Pine Box Rock Shop, but I'm not much of a drinker so might be awhile for that.

1345,Q8WN9MAahG19j6OHJFkV3w,9/13/2017,1 star rating,"Let me preface this saga with a TL;DR: this location has lots of seating and is one of the few places in the neighborhood to study or work without feeling guilty about taking up a table. The baristas aren't particularly chatty, but I've never found them rude. The management, however, is atrocious. I put up with this location being regularly out of drink flavors and food items, and their always grimy and often-closed restroom, but recently had an experience that made me furious. I'm a go-with-the-flow kind of gal. It takes a LOT to irritate me. The manager here crossed that line.One of the best perks of Starbucks Rewards is the free refill policy. As per the Starbucks website, you get free refills of hot, iced or cold brew coffee or hot/iced tea, regardless of which handcrafted drink you originally ordered. I've worked from dozens of Starbucks locations between college, grad school, and freelancing. In every one of them, the staff knew how refills worked. When I went to order a refill today, the manager (working the register) said refills are only if you originally ordered one of the drinks available as refills. I explained my understanding of the policy politely and calmly, but she insisted I was wrong and I didn't want to hold up the line (also, everyone was listening and I felt embarrassed, even though I knew she was misinformed). I went back to my seat without causing a scene and kept working. A little later, after confirming online that the policy isn't at all ambiguous, I went back and tried again. The manager said that I still didn't understand, and also that it didn't apply to cold brew anyway (which is does). She then said I could get iced coffee and she was going to print the policy for me. She disappeared into the staff room, and I waited for her to emerge with the policy. 10-15 minutes pass, and I'm still standing there. When she comes out, she avoids eye contact and continues working behind the counter. I caught her attention after a couple minutes, and she gave me an excuse about ""not being able to find the policy"" and that she's busy. I assume she looked up the policy, saw she was wrong, and didn't want to have to admit it. I wasn't willing to waste more of my time on the issue, but I'm here all the time and would have appreciated an actual resolution rather than being embarrassed, belittled, made to wait, and then brushed off."

This store is a good example of a Starbucks.  It is clean, with the occasional child that has exploded into a dozen napkins, spilled drinks and noying a yummy blue berry muffin through tears.  It is spacious as the front floor to ceiling gives the place lotsf light and a full view of 1st Avenue, minus the noise.  The staff is not the customary friendly bunch I have come to appreciate about Starbucks employee, but they are fast and efficient for the size of this place.  This will be my go-to Starbucks."

Having been in food service, I understand prepping for close but this seemed a bit much. We ordered 4 beverages. The young woman new almost nothing about tea and she had to walk away each time we gave her the name of the drink because she had a question. Note: we were the only ones on line.After receiving our drinks from a barista who measured everything (He gets the one star - my experience as a daily drinker is that many people are guessing, barely following the markings that are designed to make measuring super easy). I digress...We sat by the window, and the rude cashier came over and told us we had to move because the area was closed. These seats by the window were not up and there were not many seats left on the other side of room.We moved - unhappily. This is about 90 minutes to close. She began to mop the area.I mentioned to the young woman that i understood she had to get ready to close, but she could be a bit softer in her delivery. In a snide town and between eye rolls, she said ""Ok, thank for your advice,""We did not find 4 seats together, so my son sat on his own in one corner and three of us sat by window. Then, the same young woman came over towards where we were sitting and began mopping that area - knocking my cane over in the process and NOT picking it up. I think the shock, kept me from saying anything more.This young woman was horrible and perhaps she should consider doing something behind the scenes. Less contact with people is my suggestion. Thank you for thoroughly unpleasant experience."

1352,Q8WN9MAahG19j6OHJFkV3w,4/14/2019,3 star rating,"A lot of the things I liked previously have changed. Tables have shrunk and are round, making working harder. This may be deliberate to stop people from working there, but it's not working in reducing the number of people, it's just a nuisance and makes it too easy to spill your coffee into a laptop.There was an outlet at the one large table near the door to the basement that had no plate on it, and the outlet was loose, not screwed in tight. This went on for YEARS. They FINALLY fixed it a year or so ago by covering it over with an outletless plate. The comfortable nooks with upholstered chairs are gone.One complaint I have is that the menu is incomplete. If you are going to have 15 varieties of frappucinos and lattes and whatever, LIST them on the menu, or, heaven forbid, have an LCD menu (dimmed light, or just a countertop unit) with the choices. This is policy everywhere now. I suppose it's my responsibility to look up their menu on my phone?They have opening times posted, but if you go there at that time, often the place is dark and they don't open for five or ten minutes. So you're standing on the street at 5.30 AM in the cold or wet weather. Coffee and drinks are still good quality and service is generally good, except that often the trash bin near the customer prep area is overflowing. I'll push stuff in if it's messy when I get there because people don't care, but the bin should be checked.Anyway, it's still my home away from the studio..."

FOOD: 6.7/10Pizza  was good, a little unfair on the price but the area is developing so for the location it's alright. There's specialty pizzas, the ones here are the lobster pizza, margarita and mushroom. Very very thin slices, if you like crunch and thin pizzas then this is good. Will not come again, unless it's with friends or I'm trying to impress someone. Lots of specialty pizza like jerk chicken, seafood, blahblahSERVICE: 8.1/10Good people, good service, and constant cleaning of our area. CLEANLINESS: 10/10Clean. ATMOSPHERE: 10/10Nice fancy pizzeria where you can bring someone to impress them. Not a classic pizzeria, lots of specialty fancy pizzas to choose from and pasta. #bronx #sobro #pizza #food #photography #gentrification #carbs"

I wish 'Nobody's Pizza' was around because I'd be there at least 3 days a week lol. My friends and I get together each month for a 'ladies meet-up dinner. We find a good spot to socialize and eat our hearts away. This month, my friend chose 'Nobody's Pizza' as it is right across the street from her house. 'Nobody's Pizza' isn't your typically NYC pizza shop. NO, its more upscale and unique. Walking in on a Tuesday afternoon, I was amazed at the high ceilings, beautiful artwork, and sunlight gleaming into the establishment while mini candles on the tables set the ambience. Beautiful. We grabbed a table and were warmly greeted by a female server. 'Nobody's Pizza' offers happy hour deals as well as a Yelp check-in offer. Being the elite-tress that I am, I checked-in and received a free glass of wine with my entree purchased. I ordered the moscato which was SUPERB! The glass was chilled and the wine was sweet, exactly how I love it. I would return just for that lol. Aside from that, the happy hour offers a variety of daily weekday deals and then some deals on specific days - my favorite being game night on Thursdays (*hint hint* date idea). The menu is pretty straight forward. It features a variety of Italian and American dishes including - traditional and unique style of pizzas, starters (e.g. mozzarella sticks, garlic knots), as well as panini's, and other entrees (e.g. lasagna, spaghetti & meatballs, grilled salmon). They also offer some tempting cocktails and desserts both of which, I'm eager to return and try out. Pricing is very reasonable and affordable, about the same as any local pizza shop or casual dining Italian restaurant. For starters, my friends ordered the mozzarella sticks which they reported were tasty. For the meal, I ordered the honey bbq wings with a side of garlic knots. One of my friends had ""Grandmas's lasagna"" and the other had the grilled salmon entree. Everything is served very fresh and very upscale. I mean, I like my typical up-the-block pizza shop mozzarella sticks, but 'Nobody's Pizza' puts a nice spin on it and your food tastes and looks great. The honey bbq wings were alright, not amazing but definitely tasty. The wings were baked, I wished they had a better crisp to them and a little more sweetness. I tasted more BBQ than honey in the sauce. The garlic knots were also alright, they were a little dry in my opinion. Everything else looked great and my friends loved their food. I'm very eager to return and try the pizza and grilled salmon. Service was great! The staff were very accommodating, attentive, and friendly. They answered all questions and periodically checked on us. One of the managers also encouraged us to return for ladies night on Fridays (again, their weekly specials are lit!).Overall, I'd definitely return and recommend to others. 'Nobody's Pizza' is an ideal place for a date (seriously, perfect!) or after-work dinner with friends."

I work across the street and they've definitely come a long way since I started coming here about two years ago. The staff and restaurant has changed but the ambience, vibes and customer service have stayed consistent. I love to come her because I know I'll be taken care of. They treat everyone with respect and very family like. I literally come in and leave dancing, singing or rapping. This place is fun and live, never a full moment here. The lunch special includes a personal pizza or bowl of pasta with a side salad. Very filling and affordable, just $10! And if you're looking to drink, this.is.it! I love their drinks here, it's highly encouraged to have a shot or two during happy hour!"

My partner and I were surprised that this restaurant didn't carry sugar or any sweeteners for coffees. Upon asking we were given attitude and were offered honey instead. The same goes with salt for savory foods.The service left much to be desired, as the staff seemed to be bothered by our simple requests. Also, upon paying the server (who also dabbled as the bartender) threw my partner's card on the table and left. Needless to say we left disappointed and a little violated to be quite honest."

The perfect size for a nice lunch without feeling too full. I also had the ACV green drink which was refreshing. My friend had the egg tacos and the lemonade which was great (I had a taste). You had to eat outside due to covid but they have ample seating and it was a beautiful day.
1369,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,2/19/2023,1 star rating,"THE WORST!!! Service was terrible - came in for brunch for 2 pax and requested to sit away from the sun. The server offered another table that was slightly larger and I ordered immediately while waiting for my friend to arrive. My friend was still on her way when my food was served and the server told me to move over to the bar if my friend didn't arrive and order soon (mind you, this was 15 minutes into me being seated). At this point, I was already annoyed and after I was done eating (which was 25 minutes after I was seated), my friend arrived but because of how disrespected I felt, I decided to just settle the check. The server then proceeded to criticise and yelled at me (in front of other guests) for hogging a larger table for 45 minutes. I paid in cash and he abashedly deducted tips from the change. HORRENDOUS - the first and last time I will dine there."
1370,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,2/8/2023,2 star rating,"Sure the space is determined to be hip or so goes the hype. A gorgeous server led me to the bar (I was on my own for Tuesday 9am breakfast). Nothing left incomplete with scruffy faced bartender in beanie. But are you kidding? Water, delicate sencha tea and an egg sandwich (returned cold after bacon was removed--not ordered. Eagle eyes of gorgeous server caught the bacon after bartender took order and got lost under his beanie). Why, oh why, to serve food and drink on metal plates and cups? Heat doesn't hold, metallic taste overwhelms everything. Awful choice. Is this the :) of the shop name? Melted Dimes go into the plates and cups here. The recycling joke is on all who would try to enjoy a meal here. In future, I'm taking my dimes elsewhere."

While they don't have a gluten free menu the staff were really knowledgeable and willing to check with the chef. The vast majority of the menu could be made gluten free and dishes that were fried (the wedges) were done in individual pans so there was no cross contamination. All were gluten free and fantastic! The cocktails were also a win (if you love gin I'd recommend the Eventide). We will definitely be back next time we are in the area!"

I have loved everything I've ordered so far, from the simple rolls to the traditional rolls to the (special) rolls that I order and I wonder if the sushi chefs are rolling their eyes at me...If you've been unsatisfied with your delivery experience maybe the problem is whatever delivery service you're using."

I tend to order the chicken terryaki with gyoza, it comes with a little salad with ginger dressing. You can also order the chicken katsu and it's great for the price and it fills you up. Obviously it's cheaper to order at the place but I just order from them and they are usually swift about it. I find myself ordering here weekly,"

Jasmine bubble tea was delish. Came here with a party of 8, and they were super accommodating. Establishment is clean, and food is served promptly. Don't have any complaints really. Almost feels like a fast food place but healthier. I will certainly be back if I am in the area. Also - prices cannot be beat!"

This place has been our go to over the years, but we tried the spicy fried diced chicken dish today and it exceeded all of our expectations. Not only was the chicken super light and crunchy, but the red peppers were fried to crispy perfection too. The entire dish was edible, unlike other Szechuan places where you order la zhi ji and half the plate is filled with dried red pepper that you can't even eat. Double cooked pork was excellent too.

Dishes from the Smoked meats from the Mountain taste to one of the most extensive seafood dishes from the sea. There's more fish dishes on this menu than any Chinese restaurants in Manhattan.

1424,zvxUXRQOqzsyFiCKS09_JQ,11/29/2021,5 star rating,The black angus blackened Rib steak might be the best steak I've eaten in my adult life. The taste was incredible. I'm baffled by the fact that this restaurant is not featured on a Food network somewhere. I haven't checked thoroughly for reviews online for Chadwick's but I will categorize this place as a hidden gem in the heart of Brooklyn. The restaurant was playing light Christmas carols which made the ambience very homey and comfortable. Food quality: A+Service: A+ Ambience inside the venue: A+Will return here with my family ASAP!

The dedicated staff are as expected for those in the industry for 30+ years and may feel gruff and unwelcoming at first.  The mounds of mashed potatoes and laughter from the Irish-Italian community seems cliche.  I could go on, but you get the idea.  But, visit this staple a couple of times, and you'll see its infectious, brilliance on the community to whom it caters- an influence wider-reaching than  the scope of its walls.  The food is excellent.  The staff warms up to you quickly , and everything you had explored before in your culinary journeys wash away while eating those buttery rich potatoes and charred Steaks, leaving only one thought- damn, I'm home!"

We were greeted promptly upon arrival by the bartender and the owner whose smiles and genuine hospitality made us feel welcomed at their venue. We were seated in their 3rd Avenue facing dining room that encompassed beautiful brick walls and a lovely fireplace. Tables are all neatly set and ordained with a single candle to truly bring out the elegance of your dinner. Our waiter this evening was very attentive to our needs. Our water glasses never went below half capacity and our martinis were as ""dirty"" as requested! Our meals were exquisite! We ordered the pan-seared red snapper dinner special and the herb/panko-crusted salmon. Both meals were delicious and unique in their own ways. My partner and I could sense the amount of care and diligence placed in our dishes after just one bite! The salmon was perfectly tender and seasoned, complimented with a creamy beurre blanc sauce. From the looks of my partner's empty plate, I could tell that she truly enjoyed her red snapper. Great food, excellent and attentive service, and a beautiful dining room! look forward to returning to try some of their other specials and their popular duck entree we've heard so many good things about!"
1430,zvxUXRQOqzsyFiCKS09_JQ,9/15/2020,5 star rating,"Came here for a low-key dinner last night and was super impressed with the outdoor setup. Some restaurants in Bay Ridge have thrown caution (and social distancing practices) to the wind, but not Chadwick's. Tables on the sidewalk were divided by plexiglass, and those towards the street were safely spaced out. Bravo, Chadwick's for keeping your diners safe! Service was impeccable as well. Now onto the eats...I read a review saying the food here is boring. Does a delicious crab cake placed on top of a gorgeous mango slaw and spicy wasabi cream sauce sound BORING? To me, it doesn't! It was so good I was practically licking the plate. We also had the fried calamari/fried zucchini which came with a traditional spicy red sauce AND second green sauce which I THINK is made with parsley or celery. I couldn't put my finger on it, but again, there I was enjoying every last bite. I ordered the salmon because I knew I wouldn't be able to finish a steak, and I'm happy I did. It was nicely crusted and had a delish beurre blanc sauce on the bottom. I see a theme with me falling in love with the sauces here. I also tried a bite of the steak which was cooked to a perfect medium rare.Next time, I'll skip the apps just so I can dive into a steak (or Beef Wellington if that's back on the menu), AND finish strong with a dessert."

Ultimately, I had a mixed experience when I actually dined at the restaurant. I will start with the positives. The interior is very pretty. However, it was outdoor dining when I ate there due to Covid. They did a great job bringing that ambience for their outdoor seating. The food was hit or miss for me. First, we stayed with the fried calamari and zucchini as an appetizer. The zucchini and the accompanying sauces were great. On the other hand, the calamari was just ok. I have definitely had better. The complimentary bread was fresh and very good.In terms of the entree, I had the black angus rib steak. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I ordered it medium rare but the meat was just too tough as dry for my liking. A great medium rare is very chewy. However, the sides were great, whipped potatoes, sautéed broccoli rabe, and crispy onions. In particular, the whipped [mashed] potatoes were great. They were so fluffy and smooth. I ate all of my sides. Nevertheless, it is a steakhouse so I weighted my experience on the steak."

The food is fresh and I have left feeling full both times. We were served bruschetta, followed by pasta, and then a choice of three entrees (I opted for the salmon both times and loved it). We also had open bar throughout the event and the drinks were always quickly served. My friend has also mentioned that the owners here are very easy to work with when setting up for an event and would recommend Chadwick's."

Nothing but unnecessary force from the bouncer standing in front of the dance floorIf you hire people stupid enough not to give people stamps, fine. But to AGGRESSIVELY PUT YOUR HANDS on me and then gaslight my friends about it and say you it didn't happen and that you ""yanked my bag"".  Check the tapes from 11:45 / 12:15 on 7/9 to 7/10 2022. Made one wrong turn, never received a stamp, and was berated when I couldn't hear properly,  then assaulted by the bouncer - could have easily grabbed my arm or bag but instead scalped me. A joke. To all women - if you care about yourselves, stay far far away. They will gladly use their power to grab  you and get away with it Read a bunch of other reviews and you'll see the same thing.

He falsely accused the group I was with of cutting the line after we waited over 40 minutes to get in. He insisted that we go to the back of the line or leave even after other people not in our group vouched that we hadn't cut anyone. This was the most disrespected I've ever felt at any establishment.

Not only did the place REEK of mold, but they didn't have a stamp or paper bracelet system so that when my friend went to get a drink at the front bar (her tab was open there) and she headed back, they wouldn't let her back into the dance area. They treated her like a criminal, shining lights in her face, etc. and the bouncer put his hands all over her and made her feel very uncomfortable. She was just asking to get her stuff back from the dance area. They treated her terribly even though she did nothing wrong and they eventually ""86ed"" her. She wasn't the one who escalated the whole thing, it was all the bartender and the bouncers. I am NEVER going back there!"

He also refused to look at my vaccine card or photos of my passport, and made me call the police to get it back, being persistent that it's a fake ID. (Not sure why I would wait for the police to arrive if my ID wasn't real??) He did this to multiple other people (ages 25+) while I waited to get it back, and the other woman checking bags at the door was extremely rude to my friends. Really unfortunate that I had to wait for police to arrive to get it back and ruined my friend's birthday. After the police told him it was indeed real, I didn't even get any sort of apology. I will absolutely never be back and would rate it 0 stars if I could- avoid this place like the plague, not worth your time or money."
1438,IFQ1CXX3QTiuOjeXYvtWLw,6/20/2022,2 star rating,"I've been coming here for years and it's always a fun time, but this past Saturday I saw a situation being handled really poorly by the staff. I saw a girl get a drink from the front bar and try to go to the back area where they had dancing and the bouncer at the doorway put his hands on her waist and motioned for her to go back to the end of the line. She told him she had already been in the back area for hours with her friends and had only come to the bar to order a drink since she had a tab open there. He again put his hands on her waist and pointed to the line. She told him her friends and her phone, etc were all in the back so she needed to be able to get in touch with them to let them know and he just kept pointing to the line silently. At this point, things got heated and she began arguing with him because first of all, he should not have laid a finger on her and second of all, it's wrong that there was no system in place like stamps or bracelets to allow the people who had already been in the back area to return there. At this point, another bouncer and a female bartender came over and were shining a light in her face yelling at her to get out and that she was 86'ed. She told them repeatedly that she would gladly leave but her credit card and ID were at the bar and her friends were in the back with all her stuff so she needs some way to get that back. They finally returned her card and ID and I saw her friends come out from the back so I guess she got that across somehow but there was honestly no need for them to escalate it to this point. This girl was tiny and they really needed 3 people to intervene? If you want to crowd control, that's fine, but have some system in place like bracelets or stamps so that people can get in and out of the dance area without this kind of thing happening. Also, whoever they hired as a bouncer is really creepy because why does he need to repeatedly place his hands on a girl who was not doing anything to him other than explaining the situation?? The whole thing was so bizarre and I've never seen this happen anywhere else. Really sloppy handling by the staff and sadly, it makes me hesitant to return here."

The overall atmosphere was young, fresh, and had an air of exclusivity & mystique. My friends and I went on a Saturday night, so there was a line as expected. The line did move pretty quickly and was tolerable despite an angry bouncer who yelled at me for sharing a beer in line (we are from Florida, Ron DeSantis encourages sloppy behavior on the street so we were unfamiliar with rules like this). When we walked in, I thought the entirety of the bar was in the first room which was VERY disappointing. This is not the case. Walk down just a few steps and go through the door and feast your eyes on the coldest, literally nice fresh cold air, dance party. Reading the other reviews it seems they usually have some sort of live music? When I went, there was a DJ who played absolute bangers. A great mix of older music, current popular rap/hip-hop songs, and edm. I wish I could directly praise the DJ, but I am sure enough girls tried to get into the DJ booth to do the same thing. The drinks were relatively cheap when compared to other bars we went to; $9 for a beer and a shot! The bartender Alice was an angel not only for making us drinks quickly, but she also asked the DJ to play Pitbull for me without even making fun of my request. The COLD air that prevented me from looking like a drowned, sweaty rat and the fantastic music that kept me and all of my friends dancing our hearts out until close will be truly missed."

She looked at it, and then just continued wrapping up the remainder of the sandwich and handing it to me like nothing happened. So I was actually missing some parts of my sandwich.. that is NOT great customer service. Besides that, the sandwich itself was DELICIOUS.

Clean and bright with good seating. It seems this place focuses on the healthier side with organic and vegan. They only offer sugar free vanilla but have the regular line up of drinks for a coffee shop. Barista was nice enough but not very engaging. Nothing was offered for here so we got paper cups while we sat and had our coffee. The Barista pulled both our espresso shots before steaming either of our milks so the shots sat for roughly a minute before being used which kills the sweetness of any espresso shot. My milk was piping hot - way to hot to enjoy a latte. No latte art, just a pile of foam. Not a fan and couldn't even drink my latte due to the bitterness of the espresso. Plenty of other choices in NYC so I won't be coming back here. Unroasted: walked and the decor looks good.  The staff was down to the bare minimum.   They did have sugar free but I believe it's homemade and staff didn't mention that.   My latte was undrinkable.   Coffee taste burnt and the sugar free flavoring of vanilla was missing all together.   I would not recommend if this is the experience you get."

The baristas froth/steam the milk into a nice thick and soothing texture that I like. The other locations don't steam the milk enough that it becomes thin and fluid within minutes (might as well just order drip coffee and add milk). I usually switch between the latte, cappuccino, and matcha latte with oat milk when I order here. Though, I wouldn't recommend the hall & oats or the avocado toast. Hall & oats is definitely an acquired taste and the avocado toast was expensive and ordinary. I would just stick to the classic espresso/coffee items. There are enough seats for at least 20-30 people, but it doesn't get too crowded often. The employees I've encountered so far carry out great service with mindful attitude. The atmosphere is inviting and calming. Good for working. They accept apple pay and chase pay. You can accumulate rewards on their app (powered through LevelUp)."

I would just say it's decent. I also believe that the staff could be nicer. A gentleman in front of me was ordering and she  had a bad attitude the entire time towards him. She also had a cold attitude towards me. I would've given the place a 4 star if the staff were friendlier.

I got a large bubble tea and was a bit taken aback by the price TBH. It was close to a $9 drink!! Overall, it was fine. If I had to nitpick 1) pricier than I thought, 2) sugar level seemed a bit too sweet from what I remember. Otherwise, drink was ready by the time I paid (three workers there) so I was in and out in a jiffy. There are so many bubble tea brands in NYC to choose from... some I'm sure more budget friendly, but given proximity and selection in this particular area, it did the job, especially since I wanted bubble tea."

There's a reason why Gong Cha grew so fast. The tea they produce is one of the best in the business and their boba is one of the softest you'll find. Some places can make better boba, but it is pretty hard to find a place that will be consistently extraordinary. Be sure to get the grass jelly and boba in your milk tea, it's been my go to every time."

Even after I brought it up to him!!!!!! I'm still baffled  by their behavior!! No compensation, nothing!! Do not give these people your money!!!!!

Chicken can be moist or dry depending on the day you visit.  Good flavor in the gravy but not enough meat on the goat or oxtail.  Beef patties are decent, the spicy chicken had a good kick but the dog doesn't seem to be flaky enough.  No sea moss both times I visited."

They have a specific brunch menu where every dish is $24 and comes with coffee/tea/soda, which at first struck me as kind of steep for the area. I wish they offered their regular menu too, since there were some good raw bar options, but understand completely a smaller kitchen's need for a designated brunch menu. I went with the farmer's omelette, given my hankering for a bunch of different things on a plate. First, the picture doesn't do the size of the omelette justice, it was the length of two fists put together. I suppose you do get your money's worth if you get this dish. Came with some standard mixed greens, toast, and home fries. Of the sides, the potatoes stood out. Toast was sadly stale and tasteless. Omelette was nice and fluffy, a little on the well-done end, but perfect with some hot sauce and ketchup. On the whole, the food was delicious but left my mouth feeling like an oil slick. Our waiter was friendly and came by often to see if we needed anything. I recommend making reservations on the weekends - a line started forming as we were finishing up, though there were still plenty of tables inside."

It was pretty empty except for two other tables of two people.Right off I will say I liked the decor. It was simple but yet modern. The staff were all really friendly especially our waiter. We order a hamburger and steak and eggs off of the brunch menu. My steak and eggs were good. The meat was tender and my eggs were soft. I felt like the meat used for the steak was in the burger as well but I'm not sure. It was a decent choice. Now the tres leches is something to write home about. It came with raspberry syrup on the plate along with a cream. It wasn't too sweet or overly wet which I don't like at all. It wasn't on their menu but the waiter suggested that we try it. Overall I would come back to try dinner. The brunch menu is limited compared to their normal menu and there were things I definitely want to try like the calamari and pork belly.

I started off with the raw oysters that were poorly shucked , one shell was so jagged I thought I had gotten a cut in my mouth . My main dish was the lobster roll and chips , which I think is over priced and tiny . In the lobster roll there was barely any lobster and each roll I would say it's two to three bites . And the chips were burnt , idk how they even put that on a plate and served it . My first time there was way better . I do recommend the oxtail croquettes."

The waiter was very friendly and attentive. Another waiter even brought our food out and when we asked for a million sauces he ran in and got us everything right away. The food though. Maybe it's just their brunch? I don't know. I got the farm vegetable omelette and added cheese to it. The omelette was dry and had 0 flavor. Eggs are my favorite brunch dish to get but these are such a letdown. The potatoes were overcooked and the salad dressing which was purple tasted like mustard. I also got a passion fruit lemonade which I couldn't drink at all. It tasted spoiled.

Sent it back again came back medium. My friend just ate it with no apologies. I would maybe go back for the drinks and appetizers but not main courses. The calamari we got was really good but the bruschetta was horrible. All-in-all it was OK, nothing to write home about and not dying to go back.

She handled some money from an incoming delivery and again molested someone's poor dumplings with her ungloved hands. After all of this she takes the meat out the microwave and proceeded to further warm it up in a wok with dumpling water and warm chicken grease from some freshly fried chicken wings. Added some sauce then put it in the container. I knew I wasn't eating the food(I already paid, I would have walked out after witnessing those atrocities) so I peeped at it before throwing it out. It was a greasy mess with the rice soaking up the extra grease that was left on the microwaved meat. Completely inedible waste of money.

I think the apps, namely the karaage and fried horse mackerel were good, though it's hard to do fried stuff wrong. The sake was nice as well. I think all of us were a little underwhelmed with our mains though. My gyudon was probably the best, but none of the ramens really tasted great and the noodles didn't seem super fresh. The black garlic one especially was kind of too sweet somehow? Didn't taste garlicky enough and seemed like the focus more was on  the broth looking very black rather than tasting great. I think for LES, you can do a lot better. It seems like the bar vibe is nice and maybe that's what people really love. There is really cool interior decoration as well. Good vibes overall, but this is just not the strongest place for Japanese food."

Also tried this melon beer that tasted like melona. They also make alcoholic slushies. At night the place gets pretty fun, will come back!"
1523,xWqvccWuks8uBPewRbQArw,10/9/2022,3 star rating,Came to this place to try. The appetizers were really good. The calamari a little different from most places. The batter was already seasoned and squeeze some lemons on it and you don't need marinara sauce. The takoyaki had the right amount of sauce on it. Some places usually drenched. The skewers were done well. But the sauce was too sweet. The chicken wings fried very well. But too much sauce overpowered the chicken. The don was okay. And the ramen unique flavor to it. Not a bad place to try. But I did not like the height of the food was at the appetizer and then went down from the entree. But my ramen unfortunately was too buttery and oily gave me a stomachache and had diarrhea. Flavors good. But maybe too buttery for the stomach. I would come back for the apps and maybe a different ramen that's not buttery or oily.

They have so many drinks, and even a bottled sake that comes in a cute keepsake glass with a doggo on it! My friends and I walked in without a reservation on a Friday night and were still able to get a table with no trouble. I like that the vibe is not pretentious at all, and there's no need to dress up to dine here. They have the usual Izakaya fare but we only ordered karage to share. The karage comes with a big portion. The chunks of chicken are meaty but tender and well battered. I also ordered the black garlic ramen, which was on par with what you would find at a ramen shop. Thick, smooth noodles, flavorful broth and the usual char sieu and soft boiled egg yolk made this an excellent bowl of ramen. My only complaint was that they only have one piece of char siew and half a  soft boiled egg while most places give 2 of each."

1529,vmNpt3yV5PGCEOoOpmqwRQ,2/11/2020,3 star rating,"3.5/5, rounded down because of the not-great value. Food ranged from so-so to pretty tasty, but wouldn't necessarily recommend or return.We ordered several tapas to share, including three pintxos (foie gras terrine, sofrito topped with quail egg, and deviled crab), octopus carpaccio, the ham and shrimp ""gnocchi"", and the seared beef cheek. The three orders of pintxos (small slice of bread topped with various items) only came with two bites each, so if you're dining out with a larger group, the cost of these add up quite quickly (each ranged from $8-10). My favorite of the three was the foie gras terrine (although it's hard to mess up foie). The seared beef cheek was also very tasty and tender - this one actually came as a generous portion size. My least favorite dish of the night was the octopus carpaccio. The octopus was sliced so thinly, that it barely had any texture or existence in one's mouth, and they overdid it on the olive oil.We also got one of the cakes to share for dessert, but it tasted like something that had been sitting in a fridge for a while."

They helped pick a Spanish wine to compliment what we ordered and we loved it. There was also a bit size treat from the chef while we waited for our dishes to arrive. We started with the artichoke, (tutera), then the white beans (pochas), octopus carpaccio  (pulpo), squid ribbons (txipiron encebollado). She said there were only 2 orders of suckling pig left so we got that too. OMG everything was outstanding. I'll dream of those white beans flavored with mussels. The squid ribbons melted in my mouth. Loved the pulpo. The suckling pig was juicy and delicious. We had a 9:15pm reservation but showed up late. They accommodated is graciously. Later in the evening amid this gastronomical feast, they asked us for our dessert choice because the kitchen was closing. We ordered but they brought out later at the appropriate time. It was a cake and ice cream and delicious! I highly recommend this place!"
1531,vmNpt3yV5PGCEOoOpmqwRQ,10/29/2019,5 star rating,"4.5 out of 5, rounded upMy review is high partly because my Bill was 50% off by using the TimeOut box offer I purchased. Wonderful small tapas and meats at this cute location in Chelsea. We had the octopus carpaccio, and croquette to start. The octopus carpaccio ($18) is a good size and delicious. The croquette only come as two super small croquette; very good but kind of pathetic of a plate to bring out. For entree we tried the suckling pig, the lamb shank, and the sausage. My favorite was certainly the suckling pig, perfectly cooked, and coming off the bones very smoothly, and came with a delicious chimichurri sauce. The lamb shank was also really good and came surrounded by a tasty and spicy sauce, with beans. The sausage was a good portion and came with two different kinds: a blood sausage and another type of sausage. Finally for dessert, we decided to try the chocolate flan and the Napoleon. Both are $9 and pretty fair sizes. Both really good, in particular the chocolate dessert. Overall nice experience, cute location and good service. The prices are high because without drinking, we would have spent around $70 per person without our discount."
1532,vmNpt3yV5PGCEOoOpmqwRQ,2/7/2018,4 star rating,"This is a review of the even by Tasting Collective that we attended. It was a 10 course Traditional Basque Feast. This restaurant is owned and operated by husband and wife chef team. They have a few other restaurants in NYC. I always enjoy Basque style food, Spanish cuisine and tapas, so I was excited for this event.The interior is heavy with wood, making it cozy and warm atmosphere that is so inviting. They have two rooms, one with a bar and small amount of seating, and another room with many more table seating.We were pretty crammed in the second room, barely fitting the table, sitting over the edge... And since there were no space to put everyone's coats and bags, the seating was really, REALLY tight.At this event, we got to try Marijuli, Croqueta de Bakalo, Pimientos de Gernika, Mondatio Tutera, Pulpo de Roca, Gulas del Monte, Bakalo Andra Mari, Pochas, Cochinillo, and Txakoli Poached Pear. Even though this was a tasting event, the amount of food we received was very small. They were all tasty, high quality, and some dishes were even creative and very interesting. I wish if we had a bit more portion so that we could fully appreciate the flavor of each dish. The best thing fro the 10 course was Pulpo de Roca and the dessert. We had a nice dinner here. Each dish was very tasty and high quality. I liked the uniqueness of the dishes and creativity that came with it. It was not as comfortable, as we were over the edge of the table, and the portion received was small...but we were still happy to attend this event. Chef Alex was great, provided us with loads of interesting information and very personable."

The servers were polite and attentive. While I realize tapas are small bites, these were smaller than we expected given the price. The photos on Yelp also were misleading! I thought the chorizo hash sandwich bites would be at least two bites based on the pics, but it was actually smaller than a forkful. The best dish was a seasonal asparagus special with a good runny yolk. It was all nice quality food but perhaps more for a special occasion than a weeknight happy hour."
1535,vmNpt3yV5PGCEOoOpmqwRQ,9/11/2019,4 star rating,"The internal concept of this restaurant is very beautiful. The walls separating the two sections of the restaurant make it seem bigger. And then in the section with the bar, some tables have a little shelf attached to the wall providing more space for food and drinks. On the topic of drinks, they have a great selection of cocktails. I had the Juantxo. It had a sweet tart taste. I enjoyed it very much. It is important to note that this is a tapas restaurant and everything on the menu is to share. That being said, the prices are pretty high for a dish that isn't meant to fill you. I had the octopus, stuffed peppers, the rice with the shrimp and the avocado squash. Everything was really good but the best one was the octopus. It doesn't come out with tentacles, it's more slivers of octopus.Service was fantastic. Our waitress was very attentive."
1536,vmNpt3yV5PGCEOoOpmqwRQ,10/21/2017,3 star rating,"Pricey patio place posits perfect seafood (squid) spaghetti-style stuff.There are four tiny tables on the street. Not even a patio. You end up right on the sidewalk.  Certainly this must be some concession to the restaurant from the city, but they are not either able or willing to go the extra step to make it feel like a ""Terrace.""  Fortunately this seems to be a pretty low-key, family area and not too many questionable folks on the street to harass one during a meal.It was a bit disorganized when we arrived. We stood inside for quite a while, at least five minutes, before someone came up to seat us. We had made a reservation on open table. It was not necessary as early as we came on a Friday night. Even by 7:30 PM it was not fully booked.We were extremely hungry and immediately ordered the spicy fries and croquettes.  My dining companion ordered a glass of white wine.  Our server was extremely kind, amenable, and thoroughly explained everything. She was delightful as were all the expediters who brought the food out.As soon as our first dish arrive, the crow cats, we could see why the reviews for this restaurant or so low. To say that are serving was tiny would be an understatement. Which would be fine if the price wasn't mighty.  The crow cats were not even the size of my little finger. Two of them for seven dollars was a bit shocking.  This is not a fancy high-end restaurant in a fancy high-end neighborhood.The sticker shock continued with the tiny serving of wine in an IKEA water glass.  It was probably 4 to 5 ounces of wine for $11. Wow!  I realize we are in New York but still.We, nevertheless, ordered some more tapas style food to share.  There was a special dish of fried cauliflower, accentuated with a soft boiled egg and mushrooms. This was absolutely delicious.  The other stand out to, one for which I will either order through Postmates or return for, was the often mentioned squid ribbons. They are just phenomenal.The rest of the meal, including the small slices of bread that were served at no charge, was quite average.  I failed to mention the amuse-bouche which was brought to us prior to our meal. It was a quite delicious mussel with a dollop of tart and tasty tomato sauce on top.  The phenomenal flavor and petite size foreshadowed the rest of the meal.We had a total of two glasses of wine and for shared plates. Three of those plates were vegetarian. The bill came to $90 and we were still not totally full.We stopped on the way home for ice cream which, at six dollars, seemed like a bargain after the meal we just had.Was this a tasty restaurant? Yes! Were the prices extraordinarily high? Yes!!  I wonder if there is someway for them to mitigate the high prices and not reduce the quality of their excellent food. I hate to give a three star review when food is extremely tasty and service is quite phenomenal, but the pricing was just so shocking for the value.Definitely come and try the squid ribbons!"

But prices are steep, and the ambiance does not compare to La Vara. It's in like this mini strip mall-ish building in Chelsea, packed, and felt very much a part of the street. It sort of took me out of the meal, how open and free flowing into the outside street it felt. Now, let me get to the good, which was much.The Boqueron Pintxo was amazing. The fishiness of the anchovy of it contrasted well with the pepper and egg.The Arraultza Pintxo was so so good. The chorizo was cooked perfectly. Very crispy.The Esperragos (asparagus) was a bit of a let down, but a nice change to the meal. Small portion, but very fresh, vegetable flavors that lightened up the meal.The Pulpo was yum! A healthy serving of octopus, thinly sliced, marinated with olive oil and salt. And came with bread!The Desnudos was interesting. I wasn't blown away, but I liked the mixture of ham and shrimp. The Txariboda had this flat, round blood sausage with I loved. And came with bread, which was much needed."

It's a great combo of an uncommon cuisine (Basque) and a nice but casual ambiance. Also, there are so many must-haves on the menu that it's better with a group.The WINNAHS:Boquerón with anchoviesWhite asparagus - wowLaminas de setas- this is like a mushroom carpaccio. It's delicious.Pochas - a white bean and mussel semi stew. You will be soaking this up long after the beans and seafood are gone.There are usually many specials and I don't believe we've had bad food here.The cocktails are good, not strong but tasty. The wine selection is limited but decent. The Basque wines are fun in the pouring but not so much in the drinking.Servers are almost always amazing, funny and sweet. My only issue with Tkikito is that a lot of the tables kind of suck - either in  the middle of the front room, in the absolute back of the restaurant , or next to the bathroom. I feel like they could make it less total win or total lose on the table you get. This might just be us not being decorative enough..that's  kind of how it feels ;)  The food is great enough to keep us coming back."

The guy behind the counter was very nice and obliged to my request for extra cheese (w/ no added cost, SCORE!). My only con was the fries were a bit soggy instead of crunchy. If it was cooked about a few mins longer, it would have been perfect. Overall, still good."

The comedians are amazing, always some notable names and backgrounds. That's the only reason I'm giving it a 3. I hope they receive this feedback, but it was really a letdown. The drinks are so very weak and so expensive. I get it, it's New York. But I asked for a dirty martini and the server said ""I don't think we can make it, let me ask"". A dirty martini is as simple as it gets. When she brought it back, it was just straight olive juice. Very little and not very notable liquor at all. I believe that could be the reason they don't like making those drinks...We also got the espresso martinis, literally all espresso. I finally resorted to a wine (after I returned the dirty martini) and got my husband a bottled beer. My wine was fine, his beer was not cold. LOL!Anyway, love this place, definitely recommend going. But I hope they can stop being so stingy on the drinks. People love going to Comedy Clubs for the drinks and to let loose!"

There was a stacked lineup and a lot more hits than misses. Not every comedian is for everyone and I totally get that, but they had such a variety that we really had a lot to laugh at and so did the entire sold out room. The drinks are pricey and they don't joke around about the 2 item minimum per person, they charged me $8 for a seltzer we didn't order because we only had 3 items total instead of 4 which kind of was lousy but other than that it was a solid night!"

Spoke to the manager, who proceeded ""to take care of it"". His solution was to take the item off the bill.That's it. Not comp'n the bill, let alone a round. Terrible service and clearly was not interested in rectifying a dangerous situation.I proceeded to instruct him how to properly provide service in the hospitality industry and ask them to take a round off the bill. After discussing it with him post show further, he is unfit to be the lead at an establishment. His attitude was passive and uninterested in providing a good experience proactively.  Didn't see what a terrible situation this put everyone in. He then offered free tickets for a future show, but I would not feel safe returning to this place."

We've been to other comedy clubs before and this one is just shady. Find another one."

I know comedy shows will say if there is a drink/order minimum, but this place did not say anything about it until the show had started. Plus it was cash only, with a crazy upcharge to use the atm.

I've been to a number, and this is hands down my favorite and the one where I always return.The venue has improved significantly over past years, with a complete makeover and renovations including new tables, artwork, all new feeling, while still keeping the cool underground- ish vibe. This is Seinfeld's first club, and after he recorded a Netflix special here a couple years ago suggesting the stage should be positioned the way it was back in his Comedy Central day- they made that change too.  The employees are always friendly, from Jake taking reservations and greeting customers at the door to the friendly servers. And most importantly, the comedians are always very talented, funny, and generally without being too offensive or crude. The lineup usually has varied styles and includes at least one woman- all very talented. It always amazes me how many people from New York, neighboring boroughs, other states and even various countries visit. Always a mix of some New Yorkers plus people visiting from all over the country and world. Amazing comedy club.  Definitely recommend. Everyone who I've brought here loves it."

Meeting someone for the first time can be a daunting experience, so can trying to find somewhere to eat during these COVID times. First date and I were trying to find a place that could satisfy all taste buds so why not a diner? Enter Esquire Diner. Sounds nice doesn't it? It looks nice too, outside and in. They even had tents set up for an outside eating experience.......maybe we should have stayed outside. Like back the car up and stayed outside a few miles away. But we didn't. We went inside (masks on of course) and were  politely greeted at the door and had our wrist temperature taken. A man kindly escorted us to a table near the back and asked if we preferred tables even further back.........there was literally only one other table being used and the place is quite large why were we taken to the back and to the only booth with the lights blown out? Ok, we aren't picky people we sat at the broken light table as we didn't want to be sent to the Sunken Place farther back.  Maybe this was foreshadowing of things to come but my intuition must be on vacation. So there we sit, two strangers having stilted conversation when the waiter appeared and quickly brought my water. I think the water lowkey was the best part of the night truth be told. We ordered our food and continued in our light banter when the waiter brings out this absolutely delightful bowl of a pickle in coleslaw. Did I saw delightful? The word I meant was dreadful. Who asked for that? I dont mean to judge if coleslaw is your thing and all but for normal people like me it turned my stomach. I felt bad, I didn't want it to go to waste or worse, be scraped into a  churning bucket for the next guest. We never touched the coleslaw and he never thought to take it back. He also brought out a complimentary (I hope it was complimentary) sad looking plate of breadsticks and butter. I love me some bread and butter but again why were we given this stuff? I'm trying to do low carb so I really didn't need that stuff in my face, mocking me. Even some boring sesame breadsticks are tempting for a carb addict.Then the real fun began, yes the REAL fun. i asked for a double cheeseburger with bacon (No Bun), I was told that the burgers would be separate. Folks they really wasted a plate putting a  cheese burger patty on each plate instead of just putting them together, Like wtf. If Burger King and McDonalds can make it happen why cant you Esquire? I wasn't asking for the tender flesh of Billy Goats slapped on rye topped with the rarest of truffle oils. Insult upon injury they FORGOT MY BACON!!!!. Yes they did hunny! Before we could say a word our waiter had waltzed off in a hurry and was never to be seen again. Well we did see him. I saw him outside folding up the chairs under the tent, I get it they're understaffed. Then I saw him mopping, painting, doing open heart surgery......he did everything but COME BACK TO OUR TABLE! We were literally the only customers and maybe it was hard for him to see us given our broken lightbulb but wtf dude we were the ONLY customers. Now we weren't people to make a fuss and besides there was no one to make a fuss at so we sat there and ate our food the best way we knew how. Glumly Then the unthinkable happens. I see the problem a mile away......my date has far more items to consume as all I had to eat were my two little Crabby patties (which were actually good).  I couldn't possibly finish my food  and sit there and watch him eat in awkward silence for 20-30 minutes. That's madness!  I had to stall......think Ariel.....think! So I made the ultimate sacrifice......I tore open those stale ass breadsticks and went to work. Esquire, YOU made me go off my low carb diet and I hope you can live with yourselves. You know it didnt end there, my friend had treated himself to a steak. Well guess what? That steak was as enjoyable as a colonoscopy for him, he doused it A1 (that I had to grab off a table for him of course) but said he needed a scalpel to cut it and it was too fatty. I believe he was only able to enjoy his mashed potatoes and his salad.  As we sat there defeated we expected someone to come save us at some point but help never came.  We expected that we were either being held for ransom or they wanted us to stay for a sleep pver but we had shit to do. Finally after way too long of politeness my date jumped to his feet and that's when the waiter came with the check.

I said  table for 4. He took some menus and started walking I follow to almost the back of the restaurant. It Was Freezing with AC! The annoyed host just about throws the menus on the table slams his hand on the table and says ""There you are""  umm, ok.. thank you??We sat Down and waited almost 15 minutes for Our waitress Anna to come up to us and when she did the first thing she said was ""Are You Ready to Order?"" My friend noticed as I was looking at the menu the waitress rolled her eyes at me (I'm assuming because I took a minute to order)My husband didn't think she was that bad except that her perfume smelled really bad! (Not joking) All of us put in our order and she repeated it Wrong or did not hear most of it!Another 10/15 minutes go by and we get the cole slaw and pickles.We finally get our food after 30 minutes at least and we get 3 out of 4 dishes. ANOTHER 15 minutes waiting for eggs! Like she forgot the 4th order!I asked for 1000 island dressing and it came another 5 minutes later.The onion rings were over cooked and tasted like they were recooked in oil.My egg salad sandwich was ok. I was concerned because it was warm and not cold as it should be. At first I did not want it because I was nervous of getting sick because it was left out.She told me the kitchen promised it was cold but the heater they put it under was hot. (That makes no sense but ok)The Italian omelette, pita vegetarian pizza & tuna platter my family liked.I went to the front to pay with a credit card and the guy/ manager did not ask how everything was. NOTHING! Just rang my order then with a strong hang slammed the pen on the credit receipt.A different waitress actually said good bye to me.Not Happy, Not Happy at all!I so did not feel welcome here.

Meeting someone for the first time can be a daunting experience, so can trying to find somewhere to eat during these COVID times. First date and I were trying to find a place that could satisfy all taste buds so why not a diner? Enter Esquire Diner. Sounds nice doesn't it? It looks nice too, outside and in. They even had tents set up for an outside eating experience.......maybe we should have stayed outside. Like back the car up and stayed outside a few miles away. But we didn't. We went inside (masks on of course) and were  politely greeted at the door and had our wrist temperature taken. A man kindly escorted us to a table near the back and asked if we preferred tables even further back.........there was literally only one other table being used and the place is quite large why were we taken to the back and to the only booth with the lights blown out? Ok, we aren't picky people we sat at the broken light table as we didn't want to be sent to the Sunken Place farther back.  Maybe this was foreshadowing of things to come but my intuition must be on vacation. So there we sit, two strangers having stilted conversation when the waiter appeared and quickly brought my water. I think the water lowkey was the best part of the night truth be told. We ordered our food and continued in our light banter when the waiter brings out this absolutely delightful bowl of a pickle in coleslaw. Did I saw delightful? The word I meant was dreadful. Who asked for that? I dont mean to judge if coleslaw is your thing and all but for normal people like me it turned my stomach. I felt bad, I didn't want it to go to waste or worse, be scraped into a  churning bucket for the next guest. We never touched the coleslaw and he never thought to take it back. He also brought out a complimentary (I hope it was complimentary) sad looking plate of breadsticks and butter. I love me some bread and butter but again why were we given this stuff? I'm trying to do low carb so I really didn't need that stuff in my face, mocking me. Even some boring sesame breadsticks are tempting for a carb addict.Then the real fun began, yes the REAL fun. i asked for a double cheeseburger with bacon (No Bun), I was told that the burgers would be separate. Folks they really wasted a plate putting a  cheese burger patty on each plate instead of just putting them together, Like wtf. If Burger King and McDonalds can make it happen why cant you Esquire? I wasn't asking for the tender flesh of Billy Goats slapped on rye topped with the rarest of truffle oils. Insult upon injury they FORGOT MY BACON!!!!. Yes they did hunny! Before we could say a word our waiter had waltzed off in a hurry and was never to be seen again. Well we did see him. I saw him outside folding up the chairs under the tent, I get it they're understaffed. Then I saw him mopping, painting, doing open heart surgery......he did everything but COME BACK TO OUR TABLE! We were literally the only customers and maybe it was hard for him to see us given our broken lightbulb but wtf dude we were the ONLY customers. Now we weren't people to make a fuss and besides there was no one to make a fuss at so we sat there and ate our food the best way we knew how. Glumly Then the unthinkable happens. I see the problem a mile away......my date has far more items to consume as all I had to eat were my two little Crabby patties (which were actually good).  I couldn't possibly finish my food  and sit there and watch him eat in awkward silence for 20-30 minutes. That's madness!  I had to stall......think Ariel.....think! So I made the ultimate sacrifice......I tore open those stale ass breadsticks and went to work. Esquire, YOU made me go off my low carb diet and I hope you can live with yourselves. You know it didnt end there, my friend had treated himself to a steak. Well guess what? That steak was as enjoyable as a colonoscopy for him, he doused it A1 (that I had to grab off a table for him of course) but said he needed a scalpel to cut it and it was too fatty. I believe he was only able to enjoy his mashed potatoes and his salad.  As we sat there defeated we expected someone to come save us at some point but help never came.  We expected that we were either being held for ransom or they wanted us to stay for a sleep pver but we had shit to do. Finally after way too long of politeness my date jumped to his feet and that's when the waiter came with the check. As my date drove me home we passed Wendy's, Burger King, McDonald's etc and that was the first time I had ever wished someone had taken me to a fast food joint for a first date plus I was still a bit hungry!

1629,-f3GB9AGUqLFkXorluMFTQ,9/24/2022,3 star rating,I am looking for a place to eat breakfast at the butchers daughter came up when doing an online search. However I was super disappointed with the lack of vegan options and the slow service.I decided to sit outside they have a nice outdoor seating area. There's a QR code that takes you to the website with all the menus I figured since it was a Monday holiday it would be a weekday menu so when the server came over to order I told them what I want. They said oh actually we're on the brunch menu even though they had already taken my coffee order and had plenty of time to inform me of this. They didn't come back for like 15 minutes and I kept trying to flag them down so I could place my order since I was hungry and also had things to do afterwards.I decided to order the Country Breakfast with Adzuki Bean Bacon - Side. I did not want the impossible sausage that came with it I knew I wouldn't eat it so I paid for a side of the bean bacon. The tofu was not seasoned well and was very boring. The toast also did not come with vegan butter even though they have vegan butter on the menu. I thought about asking a server for some but they never came over and I didn't wanna eat my food cold. if I had not ordered the Adzuki Bean Bacon my dish would've been completely tasteless and boring. This vegan bacon saved my breakfast for sure. I just can't believe how boring and unflavored the tofu and potatoes were. Super disappointing. They really should have more vegan options and make them taste better. I also got an iced coffee and was not impressed. I don't think I would come back here unless someone else wanted to go. I will be dreaming of the bean bacon but I won't be missing anything else. Since they are in all vegetarian restaurant maybe their other items are better but I was super disappointed in this vegan option for breakfast.

Recently, a friend and I were in town and tried The Butcher's Daughter for breakfast; we had a 9AM reservation and are glad we made it! This restaurant was tiny and with the down-pouring NYC got last weekend, we are glad we were offered a table inside. (Also, the inside is incredibly cute looking!)Because we can never decide, we choose to share a few items: roasted rainbow carrots, loaded banana bread, and the butcher's bowl.The carrots were simple and delicious. The loaded banana bread was a bit dense - but delicious and the brulee'd banana? I wanted so much more of that!And the butcher's bowl was honestly the perfect, light and healthy way to start the day. We opted to add avocado and, since my friend is vegan, I got the poached egg on the side to mix into my helping. We also both opted for the walnut lattes and added espresso (thought that was a bit strange that the latte didn't just come with it, but whatever)!Either way, service was good, drinks were delicious, and food was top notch! Just be sure to make reservations because, as I mentioned, indoor seating is limited - but they also have outdoor seating on the sidewalk and in the street."

My wife also heard good things so we gave it a shot.Disclaimer - I don't usually eat vegetarian food. Also, I like my beer in mugs and my burgers cooked well.When we arrived, we were seated in the outdoor hut (by the bike lane). I ordered the Sunday Lager and Butcher's Burger with an avocado. The lager was presented in a metal cup, which was a new experience for me. I'm pretty sure my cup was half beer half foam. The burger came out and it was fine - the burger was just fine, but I didn't enjoy the sweet potato wedges at all. I don't mind if they are sweet potato, I just wish they were fried.Overall 3/5 Yelp stars. I won't be back."

The flavors are authentic and the portion is decent. One more plus is that they do very good and thorough covid checks so that gave me more comforts when dining indoor.Also, one big spoiler is that it always have surging cash back from Seated and even for a lunch deal, I am able to get like 20-40% cash back depending on the day! Such a great steal with a great taste! Of course, the location is very convenient and accessible and staffs are really friendly and nice as well!Would come back again and again and again!"

I had the tofu pad Thai, salad, and a mango bubble tea. The atmosphere is pretty decent, clean and spacious with modern neutral decor. It's a great place for a solo lunch date (not too crowded) and they have a backyard seating area as well in the front. My waitress was pretty attentive even though she was managing a  few tables and was gracious enough to bring me a bubble tea without whole milk in it after they brought me out one with whole milk. I will say though the bubble tea was extremely mediocre and watery. The bathroom was clean however it's didn't have a hook for my bag or coat and that proved to be challenging. Overall I do recommend this spot as it's a calm vibe, good food, and good prices for the lunch special."

We've tried a handful a Thai restaurants in Brooklyn and Manhattan but haven't found one we really enjoyed... until now!! This place is DELICIOUS with fair pricing, lunch specials and coupons/deals (on yelp and in the mail). They have outdoor seating that's fairly distanced in the front of their store on the side walk, or a gorgeous and spacious outdoor backyard that makes you forget you're in NYC. We ordered:Red Curry with VeggiesDrunken Noodles with Tofu Pad Thai with Chicken All three meals were really flavorful and saucy in such different ways. I would get any of these dishes again but would also love to try other meals there. Their tofu was delicious! And the chicken was decent, not as dry as other thai places. Yummy place, can't wait to try more from them!"

You're better off hitting up Boran a few blocks down if you're looking for good authentic Thai food.Looks like I posted a previous review...forgot I even came here before.

Came to eat here on a Friday night and ordered the Drunken Noodle with mock duck and a Thai Iced Tea. Both were delicious. The mock duck was tender and flavorful, the noodles were perfectly chewy. I forgot to ask them to omit fish sauce so I think it's possible there might have been fish sauce in my dish (I try to avoid it as a vegetarian).My fiance ordered the basil chicken fried rice but said my noodles tasted way better (yay!)Service is a little slow but I didn't mind it. They have a vegan menu too."

It came with about two bites of duck breast, couple broccoli, and generic noodles. The broth was salty but not savory. Not satisfied with this takeout meal. Finished the meat and broccoli in soup but not eating the rest. In terms of price is about $15 all in which I think there are better options down the street."
1653,bMju8cdz4RdJVoPvbWQqSQ,2/1/2018,4 star rating,"Number of visits: Maybe a dozen times.This location is close to my home so it's a reliable site if I want Boston Market. It's spacious with many seats to dine in and they have bathrooms. I've never had a real problem with this location. The only problem I could think of is, sometimes, during dinner time, when there's a rush and long lines, and the waiting time to order could be five to ten minutes. But that says something. It says that they are a go-to place for the surrounding neighborhood; people who come in to take out food for their families.Management looks as if they are competent. Sometimes, I see them cleaning the front tables themselves and greeting guests. I would dare call them a model location.The food is good. During my most recent visit, the chicken was juicy and delicious. They have a hot sauce that's mixed with barbecue sauce. It was quite a condiment. Mashed potatoes with gravy and mac & cheese served to be satisfying sides, along with their cornbread, which is an added guilty pleasure. Their food seemed to be fresh and of quality suitable for serving and impressing. They would make you wait for fresh food.I'm a fan of Boston Market and this location is near my house so I'll be a little biased and give this place four out of five stars. Will I return? Oh, yes."

After reading some of the other reviewers' remarks made be think that this BM has changed. Thankfully Shianna was there to greet me and she dispelled all the negative remarks that I've read. Her service and disposition was excellent. She let me know the chicken would be ready in 10 mins and at 10 mins she called me to fix my order while trying to satisfy another customer who was having an issue with his meal. The food still is one of the best of any of the other BMs that I've visited. Why not 5 stars? Cus a customer with pink spandex on messed up meal as she walked by.

Well anywho...we come here and everyone is very friendly..well expect one of the managers. The ladies serving the food are great, they are patient with the customers and friendly. The young guy that works there with the light eyes is awesome. Now the food, the sides are good. The spinach is very good and so is the sweet potatoes. I noticed they eliminated the ""loaded mash"" and replaced it with a garlic mash. I prefer the garlic mash, it tastes wayyy better. The Pot Pie is good I only eat some of the crust, the BF eats the filing lol. Now the chicken is good although some days it's off. Not bad just not as great as it should be.

I don't  know if the potatoes are being left out for a long period of time Or they are being over cooked. The first I ordered the potatoes they were dried and some of the potatoes were a little crispy on the skin. This time around the potatoes were so hard my fork was having a hard time going through, when I finally scooped up the potatoe it was hard to chew. My son ordered a kids meal with a side of potatoes that were also hard. Unfortunately we ordered to go, not worth going back for potatoes... Won't be ordering potatoes from Boston market In a while."

First, I asked for dark meat and because I didn't understand the guy got half chicken for an extra $1 EACH. This was two orders. Second, I asked for Cream Spinach and MIXED veggies. WITHOUT being told they are called ""Premium Sides"" and cost an extra $.25 each. I wasn't even aware until I received the bill. That has always been a regular side. Now it's called ""Premium"". Worst part the menu doesn't even tell what is a regular or premium side. Subways tells you the Guacamole is extra.

I know I can always play it safe w/ the grandma's tomato gravy. The ambiance is 5/5 as well as the service. Will I be returning soon? Yes

They were fairly open for a late lunch on Sunday and we ordered the Vodka pie and the truffle gnocchi. The vodka slice was quite good and the thin crust made it easy to eat and not feel overwhelmed. It isn't the best vodka slice I've had in the city (Prince st is def better), but it lives up. The pasta was a bit too much for me - the truffle flavor was just so strong that I had to quit after eating only a few bites. I wouldn't order that again, but could see myself back here for the pizza."

I may not have the best point of view since pizza seems to be the main attraction here and I got the garlic and oil pasta, which I still thought was good. This place really fills up for later dinners so plan ahead. I started with an espresso martini and no complaints there. I get this is New York, but I still get somewhat deflated when I go to an Italian restaurant and there's no free bread. I was between two pasta dishes but the server was overjoyed about the garlic and oil one, despite me being afraid it would be a bit plain. It honestly was, but that's the nature of the dish so no one's fault. The rest of my party got pizza and it looked and smelled insanely good. Struggles of being dairy-free! The prices aren't too bad especially for the nice location and interior. Service is top notch and friendly as well!"
1670,bMju8cdz4RdJVoPvbWQqSQ,2/27/2022,5 star rating,"Came here with a reservation for 6 on a Saturday night and it was perfect! Some of our party was running late but they let us sit immediately despite the whole party not being present. We were sat outside in their outdoor cabins which were pretty cold because they don't have the heat lamps running if nobody is in there but after about 20 minutes it did a decent job warming our pod. I would still suggest dressing warm as it was still a little chilly but it was also a very cold night! The service here is amazing and great if you're going in a large group for a birthday!!We got everything to share so first started with 3 pitchers of their red sangria which was super yummy and refreshing but not too strong. The pitchers serve roughly 5 glasses each.Then we got 4 appetizers to share - -Fried Zucchini Matchsticks : these tasted like shoe string fries which were super yummy to munch on-Grass-fed Meatballs : comes with 3 meatballs in an amazing sauce and little bread/cracker pieces to dip in the sauce-Burrata : comes with large tomato slices and tasted super fresh-Kale Salad : SO GOOD has these little cheese crisps that tie it all togetherShared 6 Entrees -- Steak : Not a huge piece of steak but cooked perfectly and comes with a sweetish arugula salad which went together very well- Orricheta : The flavors together with the pasta was super yummy, but wasn't a huge fan of the broccoli but that's just me being picky- Vodka Pie : super super thin pizza that's not too overwhelming- Cacio e Pepe : this was just okay in my opinion, wasn't too saucy or creamy - Gnocchi Con Crema Al Tartufo  : THE STAR OF THE SHOW this gnocci is so truffley i could have it every dayLastly, shared 2 desserts- Homemade Brownie - so so chocolatey and comes with fruit and a strawberry type of sauce overall was very good especially for a chocolate lover- S'mores Pizza - Chocolate, Marshmallow, and Graham Crackers on a pizza...i mean what more could you ask for - it was really good you should definitely try if you're going hereIf you're coming here - top 3 suggestions: Kale Salad, GNOCCHI CON CREMA  AL TARTUFO, and the S'mores PizzaDO NOT FORGET TO GET THE GNOCCHI CON CREMA AL TARTUFO - one of my fav dishes EVER"

Checked my Resy and they had reservations in like 5 minutes and I was 5 minutes away in between drinks and a movie that started in 40 minutes so I walked right in. They asked if we had reservations but it was pretty empty. They had 3 free tables, a totally empty bar and a party of 8 when you first walked in. Then around the bend they had maybe 4 other parties in the small very cool looking space decked out with mirrors, neon lights and very ornate light fixtures from a beautiful period that I cannot coin. They are really pretty and it's a little dark in there. The plates on the tables were very pretty as well. I ordered Passata Pomodoro E Basilica and my friend got the chicken park with zucchini noodles. I also ordered calamari which I never got Im assuming they waiter couldn't hear me over the loud music. No big deal we were kind of in a rush but I like anticipated it coming out the whole time but our food came to the table in about 5-8 minutes after ordering which made me happy. The serving size was perfect I hate to waste food and the chicken parm almost made me say why didn't I order that. But I love spaghetti and mine was PERFECT. They gave me some cheese on the side. The zucchini noodles were good according to my friend. The chicken was chefs kiss! We also ordered the lemon ricotta donuts to go. I loved them. Dense, sweet, light sauce. The one thing that happened that could have gone left is that I BMOB. I just so happened to be in between spots and was gifted a small bottle of champagne. I set it in the table when we got in and after the server made 3 consecutive heart eyes pointing at the bottle I was like hey let's crack this thang open. I asked for a glass and this is the point where the server should have said something. But he brought the glass and 3 minutes later the hostess or whoever came really close to me to tell me I had to pay extra and I was all mouth full couldn't even respond and slightly embarrassed. But I mean I get it. I just felt like the delivery happened at an awkward time and it's not that big or a deal I could pay or drink it later. I chose the later. Anyway I'm glad I got in despite some small things and I was thrilled that it wasn't to crazy and we got a table right away and the food and then left. Short but sweet trip for some AMAZING Italian food. I go to lil Frankie's often and I believe it's part of the set Sauce, Lil Frankie's and idk they last one but definitely great vibes, ambiance, and food. The tables are tiny and if you are as lucky as me to find parking well geesh you might as well play lotto."

Answered all questions and made great recommendations. The Ricotta was brought to us complimentary! The food was delicious flavorful and excellent quality!

It's funny because she only ate Campbell's chicken noodle soup for breakfast every day for 18 years!  This was a wonderful experience. I could write pages but I'll hit the highlights. Lord, it was all a high for me. I'm not a wino even though I love it. But I have always been a cheap date!  The broiled oysters were to die for, tomahawk steak, ( WHAT!) just incredible, duck lasagna was a new experience and divine , but the best dish was a food memory for my girl. The mashed potatoes!  Always her favorite, she believes these potatoes have something so special. I should have asked for the recipe. We had other dishes as well, but honestly everything was exemplary. The sommelier was new and could not have been nicer. Especially for a doofus like me! A delightful time for me and my girl!"

The ambiance was exactly what we wanted with classic songs and hints of romance playing over the speakers. We were seated at a comfortable booth where we both could people watch and be close. As they are known for their meats, we ordered the meats. We got the bone-in ribeye and the dry-aged flatiron steaks. Both were spectacular. If I were to go with one, I would pick the rib-eye which had more flavor and was more tender. The sides of brussel sprouts and whipped potatoes didn't disappoint. Oysters were also delicious as a starter. We finished the occasion dinner with an affogato with a biscotti *chefs kiss* -- not too much but just enough sweetness to complete. I have to add that their California red blend Chappellet was some of the best wine I've tasted. Overall, 5 stars for ambiance, service and quality of food."

We had made reservations for indoor seating and we were seated by the bar area. The seats were extremely close together, and not like the steakhouse area seating. We were basically sitting with another couple and every conversation they were having and we were having intertwined with each other. That was something I didn't enjoy. Also, the seats and tables were so close together. There was barely an opening to get to the booth part of the seating arrangement. This was one time where we all said, maybe we should have selected outdoor dining, as there was more room and it would have amplified our dining experience.We ended up getting a tomahawk, branzino, mashed potatoes, Brussel sprouts, bernaise, and a bottle of wine. The tomahawk was delicious and came with shishito peppers, which I was excited about and ate a bunch, hoping I didn't get a hot one. I ended up not getting a hot pepper, so it was a success. The branzino was also good, unfortunately, I found a bone in the area I took and one thing I can't stand is finding a bone in my fish. It makes me not eat it anymore. Espresso martinis were also ordered, and they seemed to enjoy them. For an app, we also got steak tartare, which was phenomenal. It ended up being just under $600 for 4 people."
1682,bMju8cdz4RdJVoPvbWQqSQ,7/31/2022,3 star rating,I love my steak and I love my NY steakhouses. I heard a lot of reviews for Bowery Meat Company and figured that it must be similar to other steakhouses in the city. Boy was I wrong...We ordered the Japanese Wagyu cut on their menu (approximately $400) and instantly regretted it. It did not have the marbling one would expect with Wagyu and it definitely did not taste as good as the bone-in ribeye. If you were to ask me what my biggest mistake at a steakhouse was... my answer would involve picking the Japenese Wagyu cut.I do want to mention that the service was phenomenal and that this review is 3 stars because of the overly expensive and underwhelming Japanese Wagyu cut.

All the tables were properly socially distanced and clean.  All servers and staff wore masks and we felt very safe.The menu is limited but still has such wonderful options available! Full wine list was available too! We had a wonderful meal, stuffed artichokes, spedini, fresh (and I mean FRESH) mozzarella and roasted peppers that were delicious!! Classic chicken parmigiana with pasta, chicken scarpiello, and sausage with broccoli rabe!! Everyone enjoyed themselves.We are so happy they are offering outdoor dining and take out! We can't wait to be come back again!"

Def go for the price fixed meal you get the best bang for your buck. I ordered the egg plant and it was fantastic. The sauce was very well done.Now for the cons. The service was less than desirable and not very attentive. Could be better considering how expensive the food was.

Inside, it was about 75% lettuce, tomato, and white rice, with minimal beans, meat, or cheese to speak of. I couldn't find any onion, cilantro, or jalapeno, so the 'pico de gallo' may have just been chopped tomato by itself?The al pastor, for what it's worth, was solid, but there were several bay leaves & bay leaf stems mixed in with the meat as well (love the flavor bay leaves add, but they're not meant to be eaten!).In spite of all of this, I'd probably go back at a ~$10 price-point, but for over $15, I was definitely expecting a little more."

Sahara was perfect! Plenty of street parking. We were sat right away. The smells of roasting meat and baked sweets were lovely. We had the tabouli to start and it came with fresh baked bread that was delicious. When drizzled with the yogurt and red spicy sauce, The tabouli rose to new level of yum. Im used to having more parsley in the mix but this one had something smokey. Maybe paprika? I liked it. We both had lamb, one gyro and one entree with rice. Plenty of food on both plates, enough for leftovers. For dessert, we tried the baklava. Wow!! Now thats exactly how I want it to taste. Crispy, flaky dough layered plentifully with pistachios and soaked in honey. There were 4 pieces but I couldve had double that and not wanted to stop popping them in my face. Neither of us are locals on Staten Island, so felt quite lucky finding a truly worthy restaurant where every dish was spot on. The staff was friendly and really attentive. I mean super attentive, bringing water, napkins, and anything we'd usually need to ask for, before realizing we needed it.  The only glitch was when we checked in on Yelp and asked to use the discount. We were told you have to spend $100. That shouldve been posted on the deal. Except for that issue, we were very happy with our meal and would be glad to return!"

Adana Kebab was really good and Lebne was okay but it was more sour than what I'm usually used to so I wasn't a total fan of that dish in particular. However, their bread was amazing! I was also a fan of the ambiance of the restaurant it was a really huge space and the customers were socially distanced as well. I was also very pleased because they honored my yelp check in coupon as well. The service was okay because I think they were a little short staffed. The restaurant was also not very crowded when I went for dinner around 8 pm, by the time I left it was around 9 pm and they still didn't have many people come in. The salad and rice that they served along with the platters were really appetizing. The price was slightly more expensive than other restaurants in the neighborhood but it was definitely worth it!!"

1710,MHuhN-URZQ22Anrpu6juhg,9/22/2021,1 star rating,"The kebabs are not tasty. Was expecting softer meat. I think they just buy whatever is cheaper. Given that prices are very inflated in comparison to other restaurants around, would be nice if they weren't greedy. Will not be coming back. Rather buy Gyro from the carts for fraction of the price or order from Nargis in Brooklyn for kebabs.I bumped down to 1 star from 2 stars due to a response the restaurant management sent in response to my review. Seems like customer is always wrong here and the merchant is always right. I have attached their response in the image. The person responding to reviews is so aggressive and has no place in customer service industry. If you can't handle criticism from your guests, you have no business running a restaurant. If I were in food industry, I'd read every single review and use them to improve my service. It's free survey that others have to pay for. You're literally being told what the issue is and you chose to attack me instead of owning up to your weaknesses and improving."

The food here was amazing, and you can tell they really focus on quality. It did take a bit long to get the food, but definitely worth the wait. We started with the sampler platter from the cold appetizer menu, and that was probably my favorite part of the meal! They serve it with warm bread, and I mean who doesn't love warm bread right? I got the lamb mixed grill for my entree, and it was delicious! I ended up taking home leftovers because there was just so much food. Overall I really enjoyed the high quality, authentic, unique foods I got to try. Plus the staff was super friendly, so another plus!!"

The food came out quickly and the people who work here are Very nice. They had a good amount of people there for it being 7am.

That is not a good position for some one taking breakfast orders for people that have a busy day ahead. I ordered a breakfast platter with sausage, bacon with whole toast and butter and jelly added to the toast. I only received eggs, bacon with no sausage, and two pieces if un-toasted dry bread. When I called about the error I was told come in tomorrow so they can fix it. When I came in the cashier pretended he didn't speak to me on the phone and that it was his partner who spoke with me. He only offered to take a dollar off of next order. I explained to him that I paid an extra 3 dollars for things I didn't receive. The cashier wanted to debate with me about it.

Why would you charge me for that? So I just asked them that I didn't want it in my wrap at all. The food arrived in about an hour. The size of one of these wraps were about the size of a McDonald's snack wrap, except this one costs about $6 for one. Yes, I ate my breakfast wrap and I was still hungry. I also ordered a cappucino, which is fine except they didn't give me any sugar packets. Unlikely for me to be ordering from here again.[edit] the cappucino actually tastes terrible. Either their beans are stale or they're just bad... Didn't seem to have foamed the milk or did a very poor job at foaming it."

The bar is small but you can still move around without spilling half of your drink all over yourself. Some of the bartenders were a bit snippy and others were awesome - also typical of most bars.The best part about Greenwich Treehouse is that there is a back room you can rent for free. It is a perfect spot to rent out (free!) for a larger group gathering (20+). The room has a big table, bathrooms, another small room with couches, arcade games, and bar access. The bar access is perfect for ordering your own drinks without having to worry about waiter service/splitting a bill a million ways. I am not sure how much beer and wine is, but Titos/Espolon and sodas were $11 each. Overall this is a solid bar and a good spot for a big group if you're looking to book a space for casual drinks."

The bartender was tall and had shaggy brown hair- I wish I knew his name but my group was so upset that we left quickly. I've never felt such disrespect in an establishment in my own city. I'm extremely disappointed in this bar relying on the discretion of a single arrogant bartender. Now I understand why the drinks are so cheap, because it reflects the service as well."
1727,G1HUAEpZcNHXO1V1gLoASQ,9/25/2021,1 star rating,"I've never written a bad review before on Yelp but have to with this place. Actually the rudest staff I've ever met and the regulars here will literally try to pick fights with you if you sit at the bar because you are ""in their seats"". A little background story here - I showed up with my boyfriend to meet some of his friends here and was standing at the bar. These two girls (who I assume are regulars) were sitting next to me having a good time and wanted to go outside to smoke so they asked if my boyfriend and I could watch their seats. I said of course because girl code! Then, a guy comes up behind me a few minutes later and says that one of their drinks is his. Being a good person, my first instinct is that he's trying to take their drinks so I just tell him ""no sorry I think you're mistaken but these are two girls' drinks and I'm watching their seats."" This then triggers him and he gets all pissed off and repetitively tells me that one of the girls is his wife. The bar tender then also begins to shame me at the same time just to pile on. Nobody ever clarified with me that that was his wife (since why tf didn't he just watch their seats then??) and the situation could have been handled in polite manner by the bar tender. All of this was really confusing for me because clearly there were misunderstandings and then to have two tatted up men being aggressive with me was extremely uncomfortable. Moral of the story is don't trust drunk af girls and fuck this place because the regulars are assholes and the bartender is a dick. The staff will talk shit about you in front of your face while you are giving them business, which they clearly need as it's empty on Friday night in West Village. Don't go unless you want to feel uncomfortable and have your night ruined by some pigs."

They definitely deliver on the free hot dogs and popcorn, and drink prices are fair with beer shot specials for $7.

1738,G1HUAEpZcNHXO1V1gLoASQ,8/29/2018,5 star rating,"This is one of my favorite neighborhood spots to drop in on after a long day. The place is always quiet when I've come, I've never seen more than a few people inside. Their happy hour is pretty good with 1$ off all  drinks (which are already pretty inexpensive) and 2$ off frozen drinks. Not to mention, you can get a free hotdog and popcorn with every drink.However, the best part of this bar is their backyard patio. It's very big with about half a dozen large picnic tables and lawn games. In my opinion it's a really underrated spot"

In the summer it's the perfect place to hang out outside with friends (and loads of cute dogs), and in the winter it provides a cozy hideaway with free popcorn and board games! The frozen margaritas are dope and their hot cider drink with whiskey is perfection. I've never had a bad experience here, and it feels like home every time. One of my top-tier favorite bars in Bushwick!"

The outdoor seating is nice -- kinda rustic, like you're chilling out in a garden -- but you also risk having ants crawling surreptitiously over if not near your food, especially when you order a meat & cheese board that includes caramel-drizzled apple slices. I actually killed one and didn't feel bad at all about it. I got an IPA and it was pretty decent (actually wanted to try the Duvel but they didn't have it on tap that day.. boo). The downside to sitting in the backyard is being near smokers. So choose your table wisely. There's a ""no laptop"" sign? I still saw a dude with a laptop sitting in the yard. I guess it's not that strongly enforced."

The live music is kinda torture, because the bar is so tiny it's hard to fit a band in with patrons, and you definitely can't hear anything over the music when it's happening. That said, when there's no band playing it's a very nice, small, dark, intimate little bar. Very small."

The lighting was low and mysterious and in the evening they put out tea lights. The Wi-Fi has gotten better since some of the reviews that were posted. I was a little weary at first because of the bed Wi-Fi reviews. There are random extension cords with outlets hidden. You just have to look for it. They had tiny items whether it was snacks or drinks. I had ordered a cappuccino and pickled beets. The beets were nice and ... Well, pickled. The cappuccino kept me going for a while. Everything is a few dollars here and there but it all adds up. They have a happy hour deal and some beers to offer."

It is a business...not a place that is there for YOUR whim, and the owners clearly thought this was a better future for their business. There are PLENTY of places around the neighborhood to go work on your awful screenplay for hours while only spending 3 bucks on a coffee. Let me enjoy some live music, a dope backyard, and some fantastic drink specials (Gansett/shot for $6). This is a solid mellow little place. Love it."

I lived in Ohio for three years where I also ate sushi and sashimi on a regular basis so despite living in Hawaii now I know that I'm not just spoiled by the fresh fish I have access to at this time and this in particular was not a good meal.  Thankfully I'm just visiting and don't have to look for another sushi place to find to make a regular place to eat, but I will NOT be going back here during this visit or any other in the future."

Now it's GREAT (But only if you love cucumber so much that you need it to replace the main ingredient of the dish). Their lobster salad- cucumber. Their kani salad- cucumber. Need I say more?Service could be better if they didn't bring out one dish at a time. Ordered 6 appetizers for the table. They brought them out 1 by 1 with like 3 minute intervals so when the first one got there, the whole party is sitting there awkwardly waiting for the first person to grab some of this tiny cucumber salad. Their new ownership is making the place prettier by getting new menus and some small upgrades to decor, but there's nothing special about this place.Unless of course, you love cucumber."

Not that Osaka's a bad place at all, but Omiya's got lower prices AND better food quality.At Osaka though, the sushi is definitely good. It's not one of the best places in Brooklyn, but it's a great spot for a good meal, they have a nice variety, a nice staff, and the prices are a steal compared to the wallet-killer places in Manhattan. I used to go to Osaka for years, and I still have their takeout menu in my kitchen. The only thing I was never thrilled about is that nobody ever seemed to fully understand my order over the phone (even though I speak in clear and enunciated English), but now I'm smart about it and ask them to read back my order before I agree to it.It's a good place to take groups or your family for dinner, but I'd recommend going earlier if you can since it can get a bit crowded late nights."

I finally told my boyfriend and he said we should go. The area inside is more spacious than I would've thought when I see it from the outside. The waitress was also quick and courteous in seating us. The area is more intimate so it is perfect for a date.We ordered some appetizers and even their fatty tuna. Since I've fallen in love with Nobu's tuna, it can't surpass it here but it was still decent. I had their salmon teriyaki which I thought was great. We also had a kani salad and a spicy salmon roll. Their spicy salmon roll was one of the best I've ever tried so off you're a fan, definitely go and try it!Would definitely revisit."

This time was probably the worst I've experienced. They didn't have any drinks with taro, mango, Yakult, orange, or red bean plus a handful of drinks. If you take a look at the menu, that's almost half of the entire menu. I kept going up to order and then getting told ""sorry we don't have that"" x3!!!!! I feel like fundamentally a restaurant needs to have all its ingredients -- that's like the bare minimum. So, I'm pretty sad. Also I came at like 5:30 PM, so there's no excuse for like ""running out close to closing"". I came here craving a mango sago pomelo and was so disappointed to hear that they basically have nothing. Would be a one star but I'm adding some stars because when they are stocked on ingredients they can make some great drinks. Plz stock up on ingredients Yi Fang!!!!"

Fiancé was bummed because they do not have the grapefruit flavor even though it's listed on the menu.We ended up ordering the brown sugar pearl black tea latte along with lemon green tea. Both served with medium ice and sugar level - enjoyed the fact it wasn't too sugary. Prices are comparable to other bubble tea spots. Social distance measures are in place and the store was pretty clean.

We got 3 drinks, Mango Sago with Pomelo, taro green latte, and Brown sugar matcha latte. The Mango sago was refreshing and light. The taro was nutty and not too sweet and can still taste the tea. Brown sugar matcha was a bit thick, SHAKE WELL! Drinks were made quickly, in about 5 min. Overall, when I'm in the mood, I'd definitely go back!"

We ordered brown sugar pearl matcha latte, taro latte with bubbles, and brown sugar pearl latte for the kids (no caffeine). All the drinks were made perfectly. The sweetness was perfect as I asked for 30% sugar. The bubbles were chewy and the taste of brown sugar was just heaven. I was surprised to learn that the taro in the taro latte was actually imported directly from Taiwan, the birthplace of bubble tea! They use the actual taro root instead of some artificial taro powder other bubble tea places use. The taros are cooked soft with hint of sweetness which blends so well with the milk. If you are a big taro fan like me, you will not disappoint. I highly recommend this place!"

The staff was friendly and served everything quickly. We had their oolong milk tea with bubble and it wasn't good at all. The oolong milk tea was okay but the bubble was unpalatable and braised too soft for us. We prefer bubble with chewy texture. We have visited multiple locations in both New York and Taiwan. We would recommend to try their signature fruit tea. If you like milk tea or brown sugar milk, there are better options out there."

The teas we got tasted pretty good. The fruit tea was sour at times, but that's expected and not too much of a problem because it was balanced out by the sweetness of the apples and syrup. The latte on the other hand truly surprised us because although it was 0% sugar, I guess it still tasted sweet because of the chocolate flavor(?); it reminded us of Ovaltine chocolate malt flavor and we really enjoyed this drink!"

The drink is not as sugary as Tiger Sugar's, but still adequately satisfies sweet cravings. The boba itself is also good quality.If you are looking for a fruit tea, I recommend getting a classic winter melon drink ($4.50). It definitely leans towards the sweet side, so make sure to get less sugar. Overall, 5 stars for a quick and easy (and aesthetically pleasing) local boba option."

Anyway- when I got the food it was just a big mess. I ate as much of it as I could - and I thought- this food was pretty good but it's a shame I had to throw out half my burger due to the incredibly soggy mess that was delivered to me. Well fast forward a bit. I decided to give this place a second chance and actually go and sit down inside and order while there. I'm glad I did! Can't get a soggy mess when you order it right then and there lol So I ordered a burger, some fries, and even got a dessert (the crave bites) which was delicious actually! The service was good  and the food came quickly. Only downfall is- there really isn't much to the place. It's very small. It does have an outdoor area but if it's cold out or windy- like it was the day I went- the outdoor part is pretty useless :-/ Above all- the food is really good here! If you want a good burger- definitely make a stop in here! Prices are reasonable too!"

1790,fahnqhxhFqyMAHKVC01sSA,4/9/2019,3 star rating,"While the rest of Astoria is asleep, Crave is alive and well; answering the late night cravings of night owls all throughout western Queens. They have been legitimately the best option (that isn't a diner) for creative food and especially ones of which drunkards can get behind. To box them in the late night realm is a little too simplistic however, they operate as a stellar establishment at all hours, serving up some quality foods, desserts, and drinks.It might not appear that way from the outside, but Crave is deceivingly big. There is always a prominent display of desserts and pastries on the counter and a nice layout of tables just perfect for small'ish to medium sized groups. During nice weather days, they feature some element of outdoor (or sidewalk?) seating.The best way I can describe their menu is Mediterranean meets bar fare meets random diner. So hypothetically one could order grilled haloumi ($9), chicken tenders ($8), and a NY pretzel ($3). Their ""crave bowls"" are an easy choice for people looking for something somewhat unique. What's hilarious is each of the bowls have a trademark (™) but feature everything from Greek themed concoctions to things like ""Frankenchips"" (cocktail franks, onions, jalapenos, cheddar sauce) to abominations like the ""Kung Fu Bowl"" ($14 - chicken, pork doner, rice, string beans, carrots, caked in ""kung fu sauce""). Even their fries are dubbed as ""Crave Chips"" where they're more like wedges and come with a whole line of Pomme Frites type sauces. (#1)The prices have crept up over the years. There are some days where it's almost better to eat in rather than indulge in their delivery. The food when on point, is tasty and abundant. However, they do have their bad days, where some items almost just look like hot garbage. I am hoping their consistency wins out in the end._____________(#1) Horseradish dijon for the win. Roasted garlic aioli is a close second."

Brought a friend from Boston (Boo) and was overly critical but eventually started liking the cocktails he was creating. She got mad for what i sai d about her..hehehehe. Anyway, Victor is badass in making cocktails. All you need to do is tell him what your preferences are, such as sweet, sour savory etc, and he will make you something along those lines. The base whiskeys ( American spelling) is Evan Williams,  and i know about the single barrel Evan Williams that won numerous awards for Bourbon. This is a place that is very intimate, and plays vinyl records. They have vinyl album covers throughout the place. Nice little gem in this neighborhood which you can easily overlook.  Take a chance if you are a bourbon lover and you will not be disappointed.  They also have meat and cheese plates or olives and pickles plates."
1813,lxQ-tzFmL1tmUqZUN-CSRQ,11/25/2019,5 star rating,"This is a gem in the Harlem in the area! I stopped by here with a friend and had an amazing time! Once you walk in, it is very small place but its filled with happiness! They play vinyl records, so there is a little something from for everyone. They have a great selection of bourbon and a small food menu. You are allowed to bring food from outside to the bar. Definitely recommend stopping by and checking it out!"
1814,lxQ-tzFmL1tmUqZUN-CSRQ,1/12/2017,3 star rating,"This is the third time I've been to this TINY establishment.  I think what makes this place a winner is several things:  first off, happy hour prices are extremely reasonable. For example, $2 for a beer, $4 for whiskey, $5/6 for a cocktail.The bartenders are chill, courteous and friendly.   I was surprised to see a bartender playing some vinyl records on an actual turntable!  Another time, a different bartender, played music from her smartphone.  So thumbs up for having a variety of genres to listen to while enjoying a libation.Probably what makes this a cool spot is that the clientele is nice and diverse.  Either it's me or not, but I usually find the patrons in there to be cool, friendly, if not interesting. Uptown Bourbon makes it very affordable to enjoy well mixed drinks in a clean, simply designed and functional TINY space.  (Super kudos to the well kept bathroom. It says a lot about an establishment that takes pride in upkeeping it's restroom.  Word).  Overall, I would recommend this establishment.  Cheers!"
1815,lxQ-tzFmL1tmUqZUN-CSRQ,9/24/2016,5 star rating,"So this fine establishment was recommended by several bartenders that either that live or work in the neighborhood.  So we decided to drop in on a Saturday night.  I fell in love immediately with this beautiful space(clearly my reason for writing a review the same day of visiting).  The bar seats about 10 people, so don't bring your crew.  There is a table in the back that seats 4 people but with amount of awesomeness this place contains it will catch on with the neighborhood QUICK!!They have a real record player that you can request music with the likes of Marvin Gaye, Al Green, and Aretha Franklin. Their bartenders are kind and personable (Thanks Elena) and truly know their cocktails.  I had the Gin & Cucumber and my husband had a Rye Manhattan.  I absolutely loved this drink because it was so smooth. The bartender did mention they have a happy hour that I WILL BE BACK FOR!  Thank you for the awesome first impression. They have been open for 3 months and already a great addition to the neighborhood !"

Ask for an Aviation. You will not be disappointed.Occasionally, a little tricky to get your drink. The bartenders I've encountered have always seemed a little distracted by friends and regulars.

1823,v7mIzZtXgU4o1RPtPRoyZA,4/6/2023,2 star rating,"So we decided to visit this place given that there aren't lots of options around Dumbo and the pictures and reviews about the food and the place were decent. The food was good, we were a group of 5 people and we all liked our plates. Now, the place itself looked kind of dirty, our reservation was at 4:30pm so they had just open after the break and I guess they didn't have enough time to pick up a few napkins that were on the floor. But the part that REALLY bothered me was the service! Our server had this face the entire time like he didn't like us or he was having a bad day, we would ask him for anything and he would almost roll his eyes. They added a 20% tip to our check so I guess the server really didn't care to give us a good service because he knew about it. Would I go back? NO. I'd rather have pizza or anything else anywhere else."

The address we provided was correct. Ordered the regular beef pho and pho ga (chicken). The broth was light and yet had depth. A little pricey in my opinion probably due to its location in dumbo.The serving size seems reasonable and plenty to enjoy. I would recommend this place for takeout but I think next time I will try dining in.Too hungry and forgot to get a photo. Soup was served separate from noodles"
1825,v7mIzZtXgU4o1RPtPRoyZA,5/21/2022,4 star rating,"Solid solid place for Vietnamese. All of the items are presented so beautifully, and it's clear they use quality ingredients. I came with a group of six for lunch, and although we called ahead only half an hour before we arrived, they were able to accommodate us for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We got some apps and mains to share amongst the group, and also a few noodle dishes to split among the couples. Most of the items were good, a couple were just okay and did not stand out.Cha gio (spring rolls): came out piping out, nice and crispy and as good, if not better, as compared to other places I have tried.Goi cuon (summer rolls): a little underwhelming, you had to dip into the peanut sauce to really get any flavor out of it. I usually love summer rolls but would skip this dish next time.Ly's chicken wings: so good and flavorful! I was obsessed with the sauce (nuoc mam based) and other people in the group commented that you could really taste the fish sauce profile. Def recommend getting this.Bo luc lac (shaking beef): probably my favorite thing we ordered, definitely get the side of rice with this so you can eat it over the rice with a little bit of sauce, ribeye, and yolky egg. It came out sizzling hot and you literally have to blow on it before taking a bit, and even then it is still too hot, but then you can't wait and you just eat it anyway. The beef is delicious, and everything on that platter is tasty - even the scallions, I finished every last one. The egg looks like it was freshly cracked just seconds before it leaves the kitchen, but by the time you dig into it, it's fine to eat. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this dish, as I have ordered it numerous times at other places and it never left an impression, until now. Get it!Rice crepe (banh xeo): Beautifully made and presented. I thought the crepe itself was a little flavorless, so you definitely need to dip it into the nuoc mam sauce to get any flavor, which I thought was a little disappointing. However, many others in our group had never tried it before today and really liked it.Beef pho (pho bo): Broth was not memorable, but beef was perfect in that it was not cooked by the time the pho arrived. Lots of noodles, more than one person can eat on their own and perfect for us to share. Our server was great and brought us bowls so we could split it.Broken rice platter with pork chop (com suon nuong): liked it, the pork chop was well cooked and tasty! The pork and vermicelli loaf is interesting, a bit dry but not bad overall. The pork chop makes it worth ordering. Pork and shrimp noodles (hu tieu kho): recommended by our server, and another group hit! It was my first time trying this, it seems like this is usually a soup-based noodle dish but this version was dry noodles with soup on the side, which we just added in. Everyone didn't know what to expect for this dish, but was pleasantly surprised and said they would order it again. Def worth checking out!For drinks, they have something for everyone. We ordered Vietnamese coffee, a smoothie (the castaway), and beer. There's even mocktails on the menu!Our servers were great and very accommodating of our requests. We really enjoyed the tropical vibes, and the food and drinks!"
1826,v7mIzZtXgU4o1RPtPRoyZA,5/12/2022,4 star rating,"Came by on a recommendation from M.Y. and her brother B.Y. for a great place to grab a bite after climbing at nearby Dumbo Cliffs and was not disappointed! The decor is cute and well done, the bar well stocked, and the food was on point. We ordered summer rolls to start which came out quickly and were accompanied by a hoisin and peanut sauce which added a nice but of crunch. The lettuce was fresh and had a nice hint of basil to make it a nice but standard summer roll. I ended up ordering the chicken vermicelli bowl which was smokey, textured, well flavored, and not too heavy after the climb. Paired with a pineapple mocktail, it made for a great and moderately dinner. T.H. opted for a pho bowl which like any good pho had a great flavorful broth. In a hilarious turn of events, I didn't even have a chance to steal some of his noodles before he was done.So why just 4 stars? I think one or two things could have had a touch more flavor for impact but I am well aware that sometimes the flavors of Asian food can be too much funk for the general public. That bring said, I will definitely come back and try to order take out as well! Hopefully then I can upgrade it to 5 stars!"

The only thing I don't love is that the back of the restaurant seems a little dark and closed in, so I always prefer to sit near the front. The food is great. My fiancé and I have a routine - we split the spring rolls (which are excellent.) He orders the pho, and I order the pork over vermicelli noodles. The spring rolls are as delicious as the should be and I take advantage of the lettuce and dipping sauces that come with it. There are no banh mis on weekends.... Can we bring that back?! Sometimes you just need a Sunday banh mi."

Wait time was 25 min for noodles for 5, and appetizers took 15. If it weren't for the prices maybe I would not have been so displeased by the end of dinner but I was. I implore you to make reservations if you wish to not be dining at the walls. This place gets packed on Sundays even before 7."
1831,v7mIzZtXgU4o1RPtPRoyZA,1/19/2022,4 star rating,"This DUMBO location is a significant upgrade from their 1st location in Bensonhurst, which received a lot of praise for their pho and was beloved for their homey, hole in the wall aesthetic. Though I was excited about my hometown achieving some status as a great place to visit for destination worthy eats, I wasn't impressed by their lack of vegetarian/pescatarian options at this location and no frills feel. So it was with some amount of disinterest that I read about the 2nd location of Em.When I peeped the menu, I noticed a wider breadth of offerings, including not just a long list of noodle soups and rice dishes, but a section of their menu they called tapas, which is where the menu gets really interesting. There you'll find Saigon style garlic butter clams and Vietnamese Style fried chicken wings. They didn't have the clams when I visited, but my table enjoyed the wings immensely. Instead I scarfed down the Banh Xeo, a classic Vietnamese turmeric rice crepe I've been seeing on more and more Vietnamese restaurant menus in the NY area. Would recommend to share for its crispy exterior and robust and flavorful filling.For my main, I tried the Hu Tieu Kho, a dry noodle dish with shrimp, eggs, chives, scallion, fried garlic and beansprouts and a bowl of soup served on the side. I wasn't sure whether I was meant to dip the noodles into the soup or just eat them side by side, but I poured the soup into the dry noodles and thought it went really well together because the broth was so flavorful. I was really happy with the portion and the flavor of the dish.They didn't have a liquor license when I went nearly half a year ago, and they don't appear to have one now, so I'm not sure this will change, which I wonder if it'll hurt them considering the area is known for establishments where you wine and dine folks. The owner did whisper to us about looking the other way if we brought something to drink in and were discreet about it, which we happily took him up on. We also enjoyed some of their non alcoholic beverages like the Yellow Ginger tea and Pineapple Express slushie. They did a great job with the interior decorating of the space, with deep green paneling on the walls and gold accents on the chairs. The rattan chairs, green booths, and framed photos along the walls really complete the space, as does the open kitchen. It's casual but enough to feel like your meal is an event, which is how every meal should be treated."

They have a great seating area upstairs with waiter service.I had the chicken curry with rice and a pineapple bun with butter. The chicken curry is always good, and one of the best Chinese chicken curries I've had in Flushing. The pineapple bun doesn't actually have pineapple in it (it's called that due to the pattern), but a hot piping bun with ice cold butter is an old-fashioned HK staple.Definitely a great place for some cheap eats."

People in the line could not believe it either. They all said it was  a ""scam"".  This Sunday Manager should be fired. Even the employee at the register agreed it was wrong to do that."

As a person who has to grab a quick bite running to catch a train in GCT, Frankies is a good option. Quality toppings, nicely spiced dogs with good snap when you bite them, on a soft potato bun. The New Yorker ($3.75) and Chicago ($5.00) are my favorites.  These dogs are piled so high with toppings it's difficult to eat them without making a mess.. It's one of the cheaper meals you can grab on the go in the food court at GCT. Quench your thirst with their homemade lemonade, it's nice and tart ;-). The Chicago from frankies is as good as the Shack-cago dog from shake shack and there's never a ridiculous wait for your hotdog.."

The staff is cranky and simply doesn't care about satisfying a customer. If you ask specifically for a hot pretzel, touch it through the bag before you pay because they'll not even make an effort to grab a hot one and you'll end up with a cold one with a consistency much like cardboard. Oh, check your bag for mustard because they'll look you in the eye and tell you its in there and, guess what? Nothing.

Their menu says 11pm but I was told that they are open until midnight. This was on a Sunday, so those might be weekend hours.The food is solid as well. The hot dogs are fantastic, whether you have them naked or loaded with toppings. I'd give them four stars, but the bacon option is bacon bits (kind of disappointing) and the shredded cheese they put on the dogs is freezing cold, bringing down the temperature of the entire dish. I understand it has to be refrigerated, but nothing is worse than biting into any sort of bread + meat + toppings combo and getting a mouthful of different temperatures.Also, a tad bit pricey for dogs that aren't Crif Dogs or Soul Dogs but it's Grand Central, what was I expecting?"

You can set the momo type to beef, chicken or vegSANDEKO MOMOScrispy momos w/ a topping based on ""sandeko"" a nepalese salad, the most prominent flavor and texture being the crunchy dried soybean which is such a pleasure.

Very mild heat and satisfying crunch. The sauce is amazing for this one too - reminds me of a peanut buttery, soy saucey sort of moment. Can't wait to try more of their menu.

My favorite items are the chili momo and now the sukuti chowmein, too. I usually only get momos but glad we tried something else this time because it was delicious. The chowmein was very flavorful and the noodles have a nice chew. The the chili momo is perfectly spicy and saucy. I also like to add their hot sauces but the red one is very spicy so be warned. The Tandoori momo was good, too. I like that they add crisp veggies to each dish. The only momo I wasn't crazy about was the taco momo because it had been overhyped to me and it didn't wow me. The place is small but there is seating inside and outdoors, too. The staff is nice. This is one of my favorite places :)"

This place is definitely hyped!!!! - The sizzler momo's wrap was all in pieces in the bottom. just the sizzler plate was hot but no crispness on the bottom. Also, not much flavor so I wouldn't get sizzler momo. - we tried jhol momo, also very basic. The soup was not too flavorful, neither was it hot. - I will give it to them that their stuffing is flavorful n so is the orange and chilly sauce of the plain momo. - The chowmein was pretty good but I wouldn't get the beef, it was very rock hard chewy. In general I'd recommend getting chicken momos and not beef. One of the main reason I give this place a three star at best is their service; that is the server/cashier kept making terrible faces, as if he's miserable to be working there/too good to be working there. Also, very mean to the kitchen staff. We were there at 8:30 (Apple map says this restaurant closes at 10). The food was ready really late and at 8:55 pm, the server pretty much tried to basically kick us out saying that restaurant closes at 9 pm and we need to empty the outdoor seats, we only had 3 momos left in total! Would definitely recommend them getting another server."

I've only gone twice and both times I've left extremely satisfied and already started planning the next time to go back. The chilli paneer is out of this world, the flavorful momo is perfectly crispy and fried on the outside and soft on the inside tossed in a hot/sour type sauce. The tandoori momo has a similar taste as the chilli minus the sauce so I'd probably not get it the next time. The sizzler's plating is cool because it comes *surprise surprise* as sizzling. This one is great to get a non-fried momo and the sauce is a mushroom type sauce with some veggies on the side. Also it's BYOB if you dine outside! I can't wait to go back!!"

This pretty much had none of those . First off I'd say I would never have ordered from here had I seen they had a B grade ! Their grade wasn't posted which is usually a shady sign to begin with . But let's get back to the sandwich . The bread was pretty much on the stale side . I eat a lot of bahn mis and this bread was the worst of any Vietnamese restaurant I've been to . I have been able to eat left over Bahn Mis days after purchasing and it was still fresh so this bread must have been super old .  The veggies themselves didn't seem quite fresh and had too much of whatever sauce they added onto it which made them soggy and eliminated all textures except the sog. The meat (beef) was plentiful which was good  but it too was drenched in that off putting sauce . The quality of the beef along with the cut left more to be be desired .  It was simply a pretty subpar meal which found its way at the bottom of the bin pretty quickly. I'd never return as this place disappointed on multiple levels . Thank God Xe May is only afew blocks over and I was able to getter proper Bahnmi fix I needed .

1871,VHORZQg5A3YNBptRN92QGg,4/10/2020,4 star rating,"A good banh mi is perfection in sandwich form. While colonization is a horrible thing, it has produced some amazing fusion food. In this case it was the French colonization of Vietnam that resulted in savory Viet food placed in a baguette. I turn to Banh Mi Zon for my fix because they have the rare seafood option-- the catfish sandwich. The fish is marinated in spices, rendering it tender and flavorful throughout. It complements the pickled carrots and cilantro so well and the bread is always fresh. Any day that I have a catfish banh mi from here is a solid day. When I'm not in a sandwich mood (v. rare) I will gladly order this flavorful catfish over rice, which is a most satisfying carb to pair with this protein. For meat eaters, the grilled chopped chicken sandwich and Coconut curry beef sandwich sound pretty solid and are popular orders, which I gathered just from sitting in the little shop for a few minutes last month to eat my sandwich. They churn out sandwiches for takeout like nobody's business."

I got the number 4 and it was good - the pearls were quite chewy which i appreciated! Unfortunately, I'm not a huge sweet tooth and I didn't realize you can't customize drinks like you normally can in boba shops. The flavor was too sweet and the latte flavor tasted like one of those starbucks glass latte drinks you buy from the store. I didnt finish the drink because of that so if you're also not as into sugary drinks / starbucks readymade lattes, I would avoid or try something different The order also came with a golden reusable straw which I thought was a fun touch to it all."

I love getting their signature black sugar milk series drink because I personally think that they do their brown sugar bobas really well. This time, however, I decided to switch it up and try the Matcha Black Sugar Boba Milk drink. This drink is quite different and it has a pretty strong tea taste to it. Since I'm so used to their brown sugar bobas and that sweetness level, it took me some time to get used to this drink. I think I would stick with the signature and classic brown sugar bobas. But if you like tea flavor and doesn't want something too sweet, definitely give this matcha boba a try! Can't wait to come back for more brown sugar bobas when the weather gets warmer!"

It was smooth, with a hint of coffee taste. My two wishes:- to be able to adjust the sugar level. But I can see why it's hard b/c the sugar is mostly from the bubbles and how they are prepared. Still a little too sweet for my preferences, but definitely still great bbt!- paper boba straws are great for the environment, but they are really hard to poke into the sealing.. also, since paper straws usually get soggy after a bit, it was hard to finish my drink (I am a slow drinker). Not sure what the alternative would be but that's my input!There is no seating at this location so it would most likely be a quick grab and go."

This chain is known for adding fresh cream to their drinks for a decadent upgrade. Today, I tried their signature brown sugar milk tea with boba, pearl, and cream mousse. The drink was a true dessert. The tea was rich and creamy. I was worried it would be too sweet, but it was pleasantly balanced. The mousse was very thick. It didn't mix in too well with the drink but did give it a cloud-like texture. Overall, I really enjoyed it. However, I would recommend asking for light ice or no ice as it is hard to get to the tapioca balls at the bottom of the drink when your straw is dodging ice cubes. Also, because of the thickness, a lot of the tea clings to the sides of the cup so you can't enjoy every last drop of yumminess unless you use a spoon. This shop is very small. They don't have seating but they do have ledges against the walls where you can stand and drink. A large stuffed tiger on one such ledge adds some on-brand decor. I'd recommend this place for the novelty! Prices seemed very reasonable too."

This experience doesn't really make me want to come back for a drink. First off, the paper straw was practically useless. As someone who enjoy searching for and conquering every single tapioca ball in my drink, the end of the paper straw had softened by the time all the liquid was gone, but some balls were left. I had to swap in the reusable straw (that I didn't even get to wash). Additionally, I finished the drink within 2 minutes. It contained so much ice, and because the cup is narrow, there wasn't much ""drink"" itself to enjoy."

Then it's difficult to digest, therefore the quality of the drink goes down. I always order their #1 drink (brown sugar boba milk + pearl with cream mousse. I wish they can customize the ice that they put in. Sometimes they have way too much ice that I finish the drink with a third of the cup filled with ice.

For the strawberry, I would have loved if there was more strawberry bits inside but the ice cream itself was creamy and smooth, and they gave a lot of whipped cream! For the cookies and cream, I also wished there was more oreo pieces inside as well.

The ice creamitself is to die for, but the staff and management are a joke. First off all, Danielle, I don't know if you are running the social media, but your Instagram needs some engagement. Not only have I've seen a couple of recent complaints on your posts (you may want to check that out), but I have written to you via DM, got no reply, and then had to take an extra step via phone call when I was turned away from Richmondtown earlier this year, for a large takeout order. This is when you were open for your Igloo experience, which may have been the only time I've seen you engage with your customers (no surprise since it was an easy $50, at least, from each family in your pocket!)I've come back to Richmondtown earlier this week, and then today to Forest hoping to try your Patriotic Rainbow Cookie Flavor. Its sold out yet it is still being advertised on your page (make another batch then!) Well not only did you not have the flavor, which is fine, but we sat down and waited 30 minutes until we were served. Then the ice cream came out another 20 minutes later, and I kid you not it was all melted. I really wish I took a picture but what an embarrassment to bring that out to the table. We sent it back and got no apology or anything. We were looking forward to our visit but had to get up and leave. Such a shame and waste of our time!I'm all for supporting a small and family owned business, but do better. Engage with your customers on social media. Train your staff. Oh, and nobody needs a 2 minute introduction when you call the store. Really hope to see things change."

It was a breeze to order over the phone  and have delivered and it was delivered in 2 hours. Today I went on line to order, website says address is out of the delivery area. I call instead like I did 3 WEEKS AGO, to ask if there was an eggars closer to the delivery address ( even though I have sent stuff from this eggars to further addresses) the girl who answered the phone tell me ""this is the only eggars"" !! Ummmm no, it's not . I call back again to ask if I can order over the phone , a new girl tells me no, it has to be done on line and if it's telling me the address is out of delivery area, there must be a glitch in the system because they deliver all over Staten Island and I should keep trying. An hour goes by, I try again.. nope , it won't let me order . I call and ask for a manager, the young man (Dylan) says he's the manager and I explained to him that I just ordered a cake 3 weeks ago over the phone and the website won't allow me to order for the address and he refuses to take my order over the phone. I explained to him again that I can not place the order on line and he tells me to order it through seamless or Grubhub.. Im sure the owners of eggars will be happy to know how incompetent  their employees are and how unhelpful they are. Love the ice cream but I won't be coming back if the people who work there have no interest in helping a customer. What a shame to have your employees ruin your business.UPDATE: I tried one more time to call and order this cake , this person did help me and got me order placed. It was delivered on the correct day at the correct time... and then I opened the box.. the cake was for my son.. his name is Billy..."

Firstly it's a factory in there 20 people behind the counter and you being rushed to order when there is no one waiting in line. I ordered a Diet Coke float as I do every time. All of a sudden it's not possible to get a Diet Coke float only regular, amazing to me. 1 Junior scoop Sunday, a milkshake, and a nerds rope is $20??? On top of all that the Junior scoop went straight in the garbage as I found a hair embedded in it. Disgusting. Not worth the over priced ice cream and gross outcome. Save your money and go find some other place to scoop your ice cream."

The hot fudge was a little slimy and the whipped cream could have been a little sweeter. It was super rich and we couldn't finish it. This was very good ice cream, not the best I've ever had though. And for a 70 year old establishment, the ambiance was very blank. My friend told me there used to be cool vintage decorations up. I hope they were just redecorating. Next time I would not order so decadently but I'm excited for round two!"

The quality of the ice cream was outstanding. I appreciated the care that went into my order. I went back in to purchase candy and again had such a kind worker wait on me. She suggested chocolate pretzels and they were amazing. The manager , Tina, seemed very busy but I approached her to let her know what a great staff she had. She was appreciative and also super sweet. Eggers is my new Happy Place:)"

It was crispy, fresh, and delicious. The sauce was also great. Finally we had the vodka brick oven pie. It's enough for one hungry person, but since we got food before, we split it between the two of us. Perfectly crisp, thin, it came out quick and hot.

We'll be there in 30!"" In exactly, 30 mins they arrived. I was happy. Kids were happy and not to mention my picky eater ate 2 full slices. The sauce is fresh and homemade.

I can drink cups of it and still take a 4 hour nap. Regardless, I love the taste. Having traveled to countries such as Brazil, Costa Rica, Vietnam, and Indonesia, I know what good tastes like. Think Coffee offers great tasting coffee. Here's the kicker though, I can drink it guilt-free without having to worry about farmers being abused and taken advantage of. The coffee you buy here supports local girls from where the beans are sourced, and I honestly think that adds to the taste and flavor of it subconsciously. Overall, fast and friendly service. Huge and spacious place to get work done or have a quiet conversation. Furniture in the back feels old Victorian. They did close up early though (2 or 3pm, can't remember), probably because there's not enough business at the moment. Definitely will return when school is back in session!"

1938,fUcjBGgmTlvxXn2azvAijw,2/19/2022,2 star rating,"The coffee is decent but overpriced. I paid $7 for a dirty chai with oat milk - it tasted okay but not worth $7. The baristas and workers were also all VERY, VERY rude. They acted like I was causing them the biggest inconvenience in the world by placing an order for my dirty chai at 2 pm on a Saturday. They seemed very entitled and as if working in a coffee shop is above them. The only pro of the coffee shop is the seating - there's tons of it and while I didn't need an outlet, I saw several throughout the store. Overall, I would not recommend."

It is a bit louder here because there's so many people, but it often isnt too difficult to find seating. The day I went, there was a private event around 6PM so it definitely got super loud then. Their cold brew was a bit too weak for my taste, but their americano was dark and strong (I love my black coffee bitter and dark). Overall, good place to sit and get work done!"

The halves of the sandwich were wrapped/positioned vertically in a basket, and as a consequence, all the melted cheese in the sandwich fell out through the bottom, onto the wax paper below. Altogether it was one gooey, sloppy, carbohydrate-laden mess. It just shouldn't be that hard to make a basic egg n cheese and make it taste good. The coffee was fine, service was fine."

The staff is very friendly.Most people order to go but the restaurant has a few tables inside and one outside. The corn bread is amazing. Not too sweet but just right.

I for surely recommend this restaurant."

We used them for catering and it was a hit! The rice and peas and the pumpkin rice was nice and fresh. The curry chicken and oxtails were a succulent success!! My brother and sister-in-law also catered fish, stuff shells which provided a sweet peppery sauce along with a refreshing salad. I look forward to visiting them in person."

I used to work around the corner and my coworker introduced me to Soul Spot. I get their smothered chicken, mac & cheese, and mashed potatoes. The pricing is good as well as the portions are huge. The last time I ordered the gravy it was a little off. I'm definitely going to see what's up with that next time I order. Hoping it was a fluke. I'd like to try something different but when I have a favorite it's hard to change it up. I need to grow tired of it first or eat off someone else's plate lol."

The food portions were big and reasonable but I was a little annoyed when i got my food with the meat on top... I got bbq beef ribs and I didn't like the face that bbq was touching my yams and Mac and cheese. Anyway, the mac and cheese was OK. The yams were VERY GOOD the beef ribs were pretty good too. I think the bbq was a little to tart for me. I also got stuffing and corn sides. The corn was SO GOOD. The stuffing threw me off cus it was sweet."

The food is always amazing especially the friend chicken, jerk chicken and mac and cheese. They recently updated the interior with new seating and such and it looks nice.

I got the jerk chicken combo with two sides: Mac and cheese and rice. Mac and cheese was pretty standard, not too wet and decently cheesy. Rice was also pretty standard. The jerk chicken just kinda made me nauseous. It was so soft that it disintegrated in my mouth. Maybe I came on a off day but don't think I'll be back. I also tried the mashed potatoes which were pretty good but also nothing out of the ordinary. The barbecue chicken was really sweet so not sure about that. The one highlight was their cornbread! Delicious and comes with the combo!It's a very small grab and go type of place. They had one table inside and one table outside. Also they charged me 20 cents for one plastic bag..."

I walked up immediately but turned right back around. Those cookies smelled so good i had no choice but to give it a try. I ordered 1 chocolate chunk cookie and I asked for a recommendation and the 2 young ladies agreed with the salted caramel. Let's just say so enjoyed that more than the one I picked. They both taste good but that salted caramel. It was too yummy. I'm not a sweets person so please ignore my ignorance. I had no idea cookies could be so expensive. However I don't mind spending money on food no matter the price. Trust me, it's worth it!"

There was not a line yay! Perhaps because of the rain lucky for me.Because of Covid customers are not free to linger around inside the establishment. It is advisable to utilize a food delivery service or when you arrive you can scan barcode menu on the door and wait for cookies to be made.  I opted for the later, wait for my cookies to be made.I ordered the box of Super 6 mixed cookies with 1 choice of a specialty cookie.  The specialty cookie was triple chocolate chip.  1 classic, 2 M&M, and 1chocolate chunk. There is nothing like a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie right out the oven. Sorry no pictures but it was delicious. The service was fast. The staff was super friendly. I enjoyed the cookies and so did the person I originally purchased them for lol. Sharing is caring.Update I went back 2 days later for myself and food partner, and he's hooked. So now you have a picture with no m&m's.  And on my first visit since no one was outside someone was kind enough to come to my car to let me know my warm cookies were ready!"

This location...not so much. First off the service is not the best. I've been here three times and each time it feels a bit like I'm interrupting them by needing assistance. Now to the important part, the cookies. I have never had hot or even really warm cookies from this location. Each time I think it will be different from the last which I believe is the definition of insanity. Anyway, they vacillate between an ok cookie and a hard cookie that has either been over baked or left sitting out for too long. Even though I have no plans to return I still give it three stars because the cookies aren't the worst but they aren't great either."

They told me they were unable to write it on the cake at the bakery because they didn't have icing ... I was then stuck 2 hours before a birthday party to figure this out on my own.  They offered me $3 back as if that was going to cover it but the real issue is you can't bring a pre made cake somewhere else to be decorated and the whole reason I paid money was for it to be a birthday cake.
1963,6LfskUyZzmcDSV6h5kOwGw,7/3/2021,5 star rating,"Ordered a carrot cake for a friend. Service is amazing and they called to confirm the cake pickup location and time beforehand. Cake layers slid a bit during pickup and I had to push the cake to make it less slanted before serving, but that was an easy fix. The writing came out perfect and was centered and spelled correctly. Cake itself is awesome, with thin layers of icing throughout that aren't too sweet. The icing is pretty light and adds a good contrast to the cakey-ness of the layers. The cake itself is very moist and fluffy, making it easy to eat wayyyy too much in one go. Awesome cake, friend was very happy. Will definitely come back if I had to order another carrot cake in the future!"

But let me tell you, getting lost looking for one place and finding this one was fantastic.  The stars of this visit were the lemonade and the nice counter guy who had us cracking up when we were ordering.  The prices are on par with any other Jamaican spot but the seafood is cheaper. $13 for jerk salmon, 13.50 for shrimp dishes? Yes, thank you. The jerk salmon (steak, not filet) was SPICY, but well seasoned and delicious. It's a tad overcooked but not dry.  The oxtails were pretty good too, well seasoned and most of the fat was trimmed off already. We both had good left back for the next day.

I cannot give an opinion about anything other than their oxtails. Their oxtails are pretty good but I will say that it's not consistent. Some days it's under-seasoned and other days it's just right. Also, it can be tough some days and other days it's made to perfection. It really depends on the cook that day. In the past they have had issues with their service and now it has improved. The ladies behind the counter are really nice and they try to move as swift as they could (they don't move that fast because some are a bit older). Sometimes there's a wait to order but it's usually not a drastically long wait.The prices are pretty standard ranging from about $8 - $14, a medium oxtail dinner is about $12 and they do give you A LOT of food so you will not be disappointed with the quantity. Nice little spot for some Jamaican food. Give it a try and good luck yelpers!xo, Autumn"

I must say that I was excited to try it after countless reviews but little did I know how disappointed I would be. As soon as I walked in everything seemed so outdated and dull. There was one person ahead of me so a few seconds after the lady server said next in line. I asked for a medium jerk chicken sure as can be with rice and peas. She then asked if I wanted salad or veggies so I got veggies. It was prepared quickly and only cost $8.50...YAYYYY. Meanwhile, I got my food and as soon as I got to to the car I tasted the chicken which was bland and dry despite the hot and sweet sauce applied. The rice and peas were worse but I did like the steamed vegetables. I was highly disappointed and will not give it another try."

This review however is for the seafood soup! Every day they have a different soup. Friday happens to be seafood.  Since I am pescetarian I couldn't wait to see what this seafood soup is all about. Phenomenal! It has crab legs, shrimp, fish, a myriad of delicious sea critters floating in this delectable broth with dumplings and other veggies. The best part is when the crab legs have been soaking for a long time in the soup. Take 'em out and you can suck all the delicious soup off of the meat. It is a dream world. I get a large cup and have to go back for another because it's so good. Filling and it has amazing flavor. If you aren't a fan of chicken and all that great stuff that they are masters with here feel free to slide in on a Friday for some seafood soup. It will blow your mind and warm your soul."

I've passed this place several times but never stopped to try because I am a creature of habit and do not like trying new places, especially for Jamaican food. Today though, coming from the Dollar Tree next door, and not to mention also because I was hungry, I stopped for some ackee & saltfish. The inside isn't too fancy, not that I was expecting it be. After all it is a take out. Anyway, I ordered the ackee & saltfish which only comes in medium or large. I opted to the get the medium, I really only wanted a small. Once I sat down to eat, upon opening the tray, I was let down. There were about 3/4 soggy looking dumplings, one boiled banana and maybe a spoon full of ackee & saltfish. The last straw for me was that the saltfish was full of bones and so not enjoyable! I ended up tossing the meal in the garbage."

Four stars for the improvements in service and the food I get being consistently great.

Nomore running out soup by 6 Hooray!I've noticed they started selling additional items. I'm pretty sure it's just whatever the chef feels like for the day.

After some googling and yelping, we found out it was a bomb diggity taco place!The place is small but the turnover is quick. The line is managed by a staff, which makes it orderly and stress free. I appreciate that. We were able to get seats at the counter and saw our food chopped and blow-torched in front of our eyes.  There's plenty of time to think about what you want to order. On this visit, we ordered five different tacos: Al pastor, suadero, longaniza, tripa, and nopales. Once we got our order, we floated over to the salsa bar and added the different salsas, onions, and cilantro to our hearts content. Al pastor was my favorite, as the meat was well seasoned with the perfect sweetness. Tripa comes last as I'm more accustomed to a crunchier version - still very flavorful. On top of this, we got the passion fruit seltzer which calmed the fire in our mouths."

2045,97zuXSmmdJw5mE1HVB5JaQ,10/10/2022,4 star rating,"Went over the weekend for a late lunch and the food was great, also the price and sizes were reasonable. We had their best seller pastor tacos, also sudadero and longaniza which very spicy and is not advertised. They were all very tasty. After you place your order they will call your name when the tacos are ready, they come ""naked"" and you can add sauces and topping from their toppings bar.The green sauce was marked as mild but it was very spicy, and the red sauce one was fire, but both very good in flavor and texture. however I did not like that the service was very slow, there was a huge line outside because they have a bar area but not really a proper seating area inside their restaurant, so people line up outside in order to place their orders. We waited on line for about 30 to 40 minutes which is a lot because usually a real taqueria is much faster, I really could not imagine waiting that long in the colder months for tacos tbh. They don't serve alcohol but have traditional Mexican coke and topochico. I also liked that they have a water fountain for customers.It was our first time and I really liked their food but this is not a place I would like to go to have lunch with my friends, it's more of a snacking spot. The tacos were really good but I'm not sure if I loved the overall experience. I wish there was more seating area or that al least they offer take out. I would still recommend for you to try if in need of authentic Mexican flavors and if you don't mind the lack of seating or space to actually eat."

The food is  great, but I really missed the double tortilla that I am used to in Mexico to make sure that the taco holds. Great for the area but for the price, there are other options in the city that I would prefer personally."

The tacos themselves check the boxes and I personally preferred the pastor to the suadero, but there's much more to try. The salsas are available in house and they're all a great addition.

Although they are pricey (we live in nyc so not unexpected) I'm already thinking of when I'll be back. It's definitely difficult find a taco de tripas and wow did this deliver. The tacos and generously packed and there is a salsa bar off to the side where you can put any toppings on them. Line was lengthy when I went but it moved quickly and was lucky enough to snag a seat at the counter. Definitely worth the visit!

Limited seating2. Spicy salsa or nah. It's absolutely the best one.3. The tortilla is perfect. The al pastor is perfect. The tacos are perfect.4. It's a grab and go spot or just plan to eat and then be on your way.5. Limited drink menu to pair with your tacos but it does what it needs to do.Go to Taqueria Ramirez if you have a taco craving -- you won't be disappointed.

The person who was attending to us was not only rude while taking our order and serving us our food, but was also drinking with friends while clearly on the clock.

They have a bunch of different options and combos. I've tried so many and they are all great but the og plain is the best nostalgic thing about the place. I come here ever national grilled cheese day and whenever I'm in the area with friends. I've even brought out of towners here and they loved it. My ABSOLUTE favorite part about coming here though is that they have Doc's hard cider available. I grew up like 5 minutes from where that cider is made so whenever I see it anywhere it's automatically somewhere I will be going again."

Since I'm not eating meat on Fridays these days and did not want pizza, I opened up my bookmarks to see what I had saved in the area. Cheese Grille wasn't too far from where I was, and sounded like the perfect option for me - so I took a little walk to the LES to check them out.Cheese Grille isn't too large - the space is quite open with large windows, and it has an almost divey aesthetic. One section of the space has the ordering counter and the other has long communal tables to sit and eat. As suggested by its name, they specialize in grilled cheese. They have multiple varieties on their menu as well as a selection of mac and cheese, soups, salads, and sides.I decided to get their three cheese which contained cheddar, asiago, and gruyere; their spicy tomato soup looked good, so I ordered a cup of that as well. The sandwich was great - the combination of cheeses gave it an interesting flavor and the bread they used kept everything intact. I really liked the soup, lots of tomato flavor and it was seasoned really well which make it stand out against your typical tomato soup. Service was good, the guy working the grille and register was really personable and added to the experience. Overall, I had a great first experience at Cheese Grille; if I ever find myself in the area again I would definitely return - there's more grilled cheeses for me to explore."

I got a Garden Melt Grilled Cheese that was very tasty and a classic Mac and cheese because you know... research... and it easily were some of the best I've had in the city. Also their prices are extremely competitive, for $25 I was able to get the stuff I got and not skimpy portions either. I did notice they do serve beer and wine however didn't get that.

I've been here twice and the first time I got the 3 cheese grilled cheese for $8 and it might as well have been one cheese. I also had the sweet potato tater tots for $5 which were average. The second time I got the garden melt for $8.50 hoping for more flavor. The Asiago cheese had no flavor at all and there was an overwhelming amount of olive tapenade. It didn't feel like the flavors went together at all. I also noticed that the bread is always a little too hard which you never expect because of how greasy it is. And the grease is what you want in a good grilled cheese but this grease doesn't taste like yummy butter, more like oil which adds no flavor at all. The worst offender was probably the Mac and cheese bites we got for $8. They were fried well and nicely crisp but again NO FLAVOR. You couldn't taste the cheese or even the macaroni. The tomato sauce it came with didn't help. The saving grace was the mayo and ketchup I mixed to use as a dipping sauce.The service was fine. He kind of forgot we ordered and had our food waiting there. This place is also cash only which I think is weird. The server didn't try to accommodate us by telling us that we could just order online for pick up if we wanted to use our card. Thank god we didn't because everything's $1 or so more online and this grilled cheese is no where near worth what they're charging. If you're craving a grilled cheese, then go to the Melt Shop!"

Many I've tried serve tasteless, sometimes too heavy, or too light/airy, too chewy, or not chewy enough, underdone, bland bagels. Good bagel shops are really few and far between. Pizza & Bagels on 3rd is different. They have exceptionally good bagels. They taste great, they're crispy, have a perfect texture and are always fresh. Now, I am only speaking about their bagels. I have honestly have never tried their pizza, hot food or sandwiches. I strictly go there for their bagels. My favorite is a toasted sesame seed bagel with lox spread and sliced tomatoes. I also enjoy a toasted cinnamon bagel with walnut cream cheese if i'm feeling like something sweet. They are all really good. Their staff is also very friendly, quick and accomodating. There is never a long wait, or confusion at the counter. I am in and out in minutes. There is one disappointment and it is the reason i do not give them 5 stars. It's their location. The store is flanked by a bus stop on 3rd avenue and no standing zones on both sides of 20th street. Which makes them difficult to access if you are looking to park, a minor issue, i suppose if you're determined to get an exceptionally good bagel. So if you appreciate outstanding bagels and great service give them a try!"

We then got both the red and white sangrias, which were kind of like a rum punch topped with wine-really enjoyed those too.To eat, we got the ceviche (classic version) and it was tasty, small portion but very fresh and flavorful, no fishy aftertaste. We wish it had come with crackers or plantains to scoop it up. We got the tostones con mason as de puerco which were these huge fried plantains topped with big chunks of crispy pork-very tasty. We also got the Havana guacamole (would order extra chips, or the tropical chips to go with it-which was a huge basket of thin crispy plantain chips and a side of yummy red salsa). For dessert, we got the churros (perfectly fried crispy mini churros served with chocolate, caramel, and dulce de leche-delicious sweet ending to our meal!). We got a regular espresso, cafe Cubano (sweetened espresso), and carajillo (alcoholic espresso, with brandy I believe - very strong but good).Overall highly recommend this place for awesome Cuban food, nice evening ambiance, and impeccable service.

Now the food, one word....UNIMPRESSIVE! I had the Cuban sandwich, & while I know it's hard to top a Cubano from a bodega, this was....Ok. Nothing to be impressed by. My Wife's review of her salmon was ""Ehh, it's edible."" The drinks, sent them back THREE times. They all tasted horrible, like the person at the bar wasn't a bartender, but a general employee filling in and making an attempt at bartending. They did take them off the bill, so points for that. Plus the whole experience was downgraded by the fact that they sat us next to a group of people who had one Woman who could not stop coughing. In this day & age if you're coughing like that....stay the hell home. Aside from that being beyond their control, I would not come back here. Just not worth the trip."

The hostess only stared daggers, wordlessly leading us to a table. For such a beautiful space, you don't experience an ounce of friendliness, you're simply a body taking up space. The menu uses words like ""entree"" where in reality you're getting a tapas-sized plate. Expect that each person will need to order an appetizer and an ""entree"" to feel full - and this is coming from a person that eats little and almost always takes home leftovers from restaurants. It is too bad that this place was so disappointing, as I had been looking forward to trying it. I did find the food to be delicious - ropa vieja was solid, and the ceviche was tasty, although light on fish and heavy on mango.

We were seated way inside in comfortable booth seating, but all the tables were close together and it felt a little cramped. Besides that, the interior was quite lovely and beautifully colorful with cool artwork. There were plants and lights hanging from the ceiling in one area of the restaurant. Another part of the restaurant had plants and shiny silver balls on the ceiling. Overall, this made for a festive atmosphere. For my appetizer, I chose the Croquettes, which had Berkshire ham and potato inside. This came with tomato pepper sauce, which was just okay. The outer shell of the Croquettes were pretty tasty with a nice crunch, but the inside filling was really mushy. I ordered the Lechon Asado for my entree, which is the traditional roast pig marinated for 24 hours, roasted overnight in mojo, and served with garlic mojo yucca, along with black rice and peas. The meat was shredded into pieces already, and was perfectly tender, juicy, well seasoned, as well as filled with amazing flavor. I also enjoyed the rice, which was cooked just the right amount. The yucca was soft, but kind of starchy and bland. I couldn't really taste a whole lot of garlic.The dessert options were not that great. I went with the Flan over Banana Custard, but I would've preferred the Tres Leches Cake. The Flan was Cuban style egg custard drenched in a sweet caramel sauce, topped with a fragrant mint leaf. The Flan was firm, velvety creamy smooth with silky texture, as well as lightly eggy, boasting a rich toasted caramel flavor from the sauce.Service was decent. The place was bustling, so it was sometimes hard to get the attention of the waiter. I don't think I will return because the prices are pretty high."

There were only about 6 chips with a scoop of guac. Tortilla Blanca - 5/5 - this was kind of like a frittata/omelette and if you don't want anything too heavy, I'd definitely recommend this dish! It was super light and flavorful, exactly what I was going for. The eggs also had plantains in them, a combo I've never had before I think, but it added a sweetness that I really enjoyed! Aperol spritz - 5/5 - one of my go-tos and this one did not disappoint!

Most indian restaurants ussually provide plain white rice with their dishes and I appreciated that this venue went the extra mile and provided us a rice dish mixed with onions and peas.

I was in the area, and I said today is the day. So I stopped in for lunch. So first thing first, I am an aesthetic girl so I am always looking for the cute spots. At Nine is nicely decorated, but super quaint... well SMALL. I was not expecting that at all based off of all the videos I saw. However the vibe is cool, and I would say its perfect for lowkey date nights, and gatherings. Now onto the food, I had the fried chicken dumplings for my appetizer, and for my entree I had the Pad See Eiw. The fried chicken dumplings were not what I imagined but they were good nonetheless. I would definitely get them again. In my opinion it is more like a fried chicken bite, and not really a dumpling. But what do I know ? As for the Pad See Eiw, it was so flavorful! The noodles were coated nicely with the sauce and were cooked perfectly. I wish there was more American broccoli and less Chinese broccoli because I am not a huge fan of all the stems.  The chicken was tender and flavorful, and not just a ""topping to the dish"". Drumroll, please... the star of the experience was the drink! Anytime I can get a Lychee Martini I am going to get one. My preference is to add a little coconut creme, but that wasn't an option. However, this martini was so good on its own. Let me tell you it was strong but smooth... like you know you're going to be lit but it goes down real easy. Let's just say I would definitely come back for the drinks. Oh, and I can't forget if you were second guessing coming here they have all day happy hour for $9! You can't beat that! All in all, At Nine didn't miss. The food was great and the drinks even better!"

Called ahead and my order was ready after 20 minutes.Ordered the Pad Khee Mao Shrimp medium spicy and the lunch special came with a complimentary fried chicken dumplings and a Thai tea all for $14!The Pad Khee Mao was well packaged in a reusable microwavable container. The shrimps were well done and on the smaller side. The portions were decent and the dish was on the sweeter side...The fried chicken dumplings were also decent with the dumplings lightly fried and chicken well done.The Thai tea was decent and not too sweet.They take Mastercard.

Came here on a Saturday night and it was packed. The  host was able to accommodate us and we were promptly seated.  We had started with crispy spring rolls and they were gone within seconds. So so good. The Tom yum soup was what I needed on a cold Saturday night, so flavorful and comforting. The vegetable dumpling dipped in coconut curry is a must try. The red curry was delicious and tasted amazing with the white rice. The spicy pad kee mao was also splendid. Can't find anything wrong with the dishes, each of them were competing with each other. Check out At Nine, this is a great place for GNO or date night. Food, Service, and Vibe is a 10/10. Highly Recommend!"

They open up for dinner at 5PM so we arrived right at opening. The establishment is VERY SMALL so within 15 minutes all of the tables were taken. It's a cute spot with nice decorations, so it makes sense. For happy hour drinks, they offer martinis, margaritas, and a cosmopolitan for $9 . I had a strawberry margarita to start which tasted like pretty artificial but packed a punch. To follow that up, I got a lime margarita which came entirely too strong. I asked the waitress if she could add some more simple syrup and that made it taste a lot better. For food, I got the spring rolls which come 4 to an order with plum sauce. They were hot and cripsy and overall very tasty. I also split some calamari. These were well-seasoned but the breading didn't stick very well and kept falling off as we picked them up. They were still pretty good so I would get them again. Finally, I had the pad see ew with chicken which was good. It came with both Chinese broccoli and American Broccoli which was new for me and the noodles were well-coated in sweet soy sauce. I wish I had a squeeze of lemon for some acid, but overall I can't complain. Overall, this is a nice happy hour spot with staple thai dishes. I would come back! Rating: 4/5."

2108,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,1/23/2022,3 star rating,"Not the most authentic Thai experience, but the food is decent and the decor is grand and festive. I tried both the Pineapple Fried Rice with beef ($16) and the Pad See Eiw with chicken ($15). The fried rice was okay- the beef was rather bland and there was not much pineapple. The other ingredients were standard in terms of what they were and their quality. The portion size was pretty large though. The Pad See Eiw was better, as the noodles were flavorful, albeit a bit too salty. The presentation of both dishes were pretty nice, with thin spirals of red garnish.The restaurant itself seems more suited to be a bar than a restaurant. It is kind of small and a bit crowded, with dim lighting and a bar. The most notable thing about At Nine is the interior decor, which features lots of Christmas ornaments lining mirrors and grand crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. Some might find the decor to be nice, but personally I think it was a little too much and came across as a bit tacky (and not Thai whatsoever). The service speed was fine, though the staff were not particularly friendly. They also did not offer any desserts.Overall, based on the food alone, I would give At Nine 3 stars, but props to them for the effort in their decor and for the lively, intimate atmosphere. As a whole, I'd give 3.5 stars if I could, but because food is the most important factor, I will have to round down to 3 stars. At Nine is not a bad option for Thai food, but there are definitely some better options."

It's Sunny and Warmer so I took my two mile walk.  First thing you notice if you're Marianne is the ""A"" Health Inspection in the Window. Don't let the outside space fool you. There's plenty of seating inside on a weekday morning. I prefer to sit to eat. I was welcomed as soon as I walked in the door. I asked all my questions and the employees were so kind, patient and friendly. I ordered the Crepe with my own combination of ingredients. I had Cream Cheese (there could have been more on it in all honesty), Spinach, and Bacon. My cost was $11.98. Credit cards are accepted. You have to sign the credit card receipt. After you order and pay you go to the seating area and have a seat. They have coat hooks and hooks for your handbags. There's plugs on the wall behind each couple of tables. I asked for the WiFi password and was quickly provided with it. It's Easy access to check in on Yelp. At check in you get credit for your purchase. I think after 10 visits you get one free crepe. For your convenience there's a bathroom in the rear. So now for the taste! Delicious! The spinach was cooked as I requested. There's lots of bacon although you may not see it in my photos. Emphasize Plenty! The bite I got with cream cheese was heavenly. I wish there had been more cream cheese. Naturally I was so hungry I cannot complain. I will be sure to tell them not to skimp on Cream Cheese next time I come. They said they have ricotta cheese but for some reason didn't right now. I'm also interested in trying the Buckwheat Crepe. It's $2.00 extra for Buckwheat. My Spinach add on cost $2.00, Bacon add on $3.00 and Cream Cheese Crepe is $6.00. Total for my lunch cost today of $11.98! The menu is extensive. All kinds of goodies like pancakes, waffles and more! Today was a WINNER! I'm sure when I want a nice quiet cozy place to enjoy my brunch that I will return. I highly recommend!"
2112,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,3/9/2020,2 star rating,"I would've had a better experience if the French toast I got didn't taste spoiled! I had ordered the French toast with vanilla ice cream, Nutella and strawberries. The lady at the register had actually charged me $3 extra for Nutella thinking I wouldn't notice. The Nutella was already included in the price which is why I never asked for extra. The guy was nice enough to give me back the $3 in cash.They were actually not stingy with the Nutella at all. I don't think it's necessary to ask for extra Nutella. Not worth paying $3. As I was eating the French toast, I noticed there was a weird after taste to it. I had my friend try it and she, too, thought it tasted funky. We both realized that the batter they had used to make it was spoiled. Like it's been sitting out all day. I couldn't even finish the toast bc I didn't want my stomach to start acting up. I'm starting to think they used all that Nutella to cover up the fact they used old batter for my French toast!! When the lady came by to grab our trays, she asked if I was done with my food. I told her yes because it tasted very spoiled. Her only response was, ""oh really?"" and proceeded to walk away with the trays. Didn't even ask if I wanted a new one or anything. Poor customer service on her end. I would NOT come back to this place."

The store itself is pretty small so there's not too much seating available but thankfully when we first arrived there weren't too many people there until after we sat down. To order, you just go up to the counter, give them your order and they bring it up to you afterwards. We ordered a small chai latte for the both of us. I ordered a Nutella crepe with strawberries and my friend got a peanut butter crepe with marshmallows. The chai latte was very delicious. I loved it, it was creamy and sweet. My friend and I enjoyed it so much that we had to order an extra cup to take back. However, I can definitely see it being too sweet for people who aren't as fond of sugar as I am so take heed. Additionally the Nutella strawberry crepe was delicious. As for the other crepe, I would not recommend the marshmallow topping just because they put in giant marshmallows which didn't really work out with the crepe. Would have been better to use mini marshmallows or marshmallow fluff. All in all, a great little cafe with lovely ambiance. I would definitely like to go back to try their savory crepes since they seem to have a good selection!"

We had a seat and in about 10 minutes or so, they brought the order to us.The Mango Sangria was refreshing but mediocre. It was fruity, but the taste of mango was faint.

I want to start by saying that I've eaten at over 100 restaurants in NYC & this was by far, one of the WORST services I've EVER experienced in my life! So, my Wife & I live near Hell's Kitchen so after a busy couple of months, we decided to not do too much for our Mother's Day but because it was our first, we would just go down the strip & find somewhere ""nice"" to eat for brunch. We stumbled upon Kausa where the hostess outside was nice, the decor was beautiful and the menu was our vibe so we were SOLD! HUGE MISTAKE! Unfortunately, we were sat with the server WENDY by the restroom with our stroller that already seemed to have annoyed her. She helped us place it where it wasn't in the way & we went on to look at the menu. This is where things went left. First problem: she didn't say ""Happy Mother's Day"" to two moms ON MOTHER'S DAY, barely acknowledged the occasion & our baby. Okay, Fine! Second problem: She offered us ONLY the regular menu & NOT the brunch menu that had the special. Once we asked for that, she says ""I recommend you order off the full menu"". When asked ""Why?"" She didn't have an answer. So you basically wanted us to spend more money... okay.Third Problem: she takes my brunch menu order that was the steak & eggs. She failed to ask how I like my eggs & I failed to inform her. When I get steak with egg whites (which I don't eat), I say ""oh! I'm sorry... I don't eat egg whites. I forgot to say how I like them. Can I have them scrambled?"" This lady looked at me like ""what you want me to do about it?"" Then proceeds to say ""oh you didn't tell me so....."". Appalled was an understatement. You were supposed to ASK me & not FAULT me. If it was up to her, I would've sat there & ate egg whites. She ended up taking it back & this VERY NICE GUY brought it out to me. I couldn't thank him enough for some HOSPITALITY!Fourth problem: took my brunch menu order then walked away. We had to call her back to take my wife's order that wasn't on the brunch menu.Fourth problem: She gives a dessert menu. Now, dessert was included in my brunch. We choose, she brings it out.Fifth problem: we asked for the bill & the charged us for the dessert. When my Wife notices she says ""oh! I got confused because she didn't order off the brunch menu so I brought out the regular dessert menu!"" WHAT?!?! Then proceeds to QUICKLY SWIPE our card & I MISTAKENLY tipped her the the suggested cus she DIDNT DESERVE ANYTHING!Sixth problem: So because my brunch came with a dessert I didn't have, I asked for the chocolate cake to go! She said ""no problem"", takes forever to bring it out & I happen to open it today & look at the photo attached.In conclusion, people come to me often for restaurant reviews & I wouldn't a SOUL to step foot in this establishment. I hate to say this but I couldn't help but notice that we were the ONLY black family there & the only one getting this treatment. Coincidence! I could've made a big deal about the whole ordeal but we had our baby girl with us & again, it was our first Mother's Day so we wasn't going to let her misery tarnish our day!"

Brought me my drink 5 minutes after, and left right away before I could order food. Took another 15 to order food. Eventually I ordered my food. ordered anticuchos to start, and shrimp fettuccini a la huancaina. Anticuchos were good. I did not taste very fresh, it was as if they had cooked it first thing in the morning and then just microwaved it. Fettuccini was very good and tasted amazing! So good!Got a pisco sour for the drink. Pretty good. Overall my experience was all right. Would've been better if the bartender was a little more friendly and attentive"
2125,dzwa-zvkW6L2ZUGyNGrmuA,11/6/2022,2 star rating,"Wanted to try an authentic Peruvian food spot this Saturday, therefore I drove from Philly all the way to NYC. I was going to originally go to Pio Pio but someone recommended this place. Got there and was really feeling the vibe here, it has a unique look to it. After about 15 minutes was asked if they could take our order, drinks hadn't been ordered yet. Well we ordered a pitcher of chicha, and some appetizers. They bring you some spicy sauces with some roasted corn to munch on. I don't know maybe 8-10 pieces of corn between 2 adults and 2 kids seems super stingy to me. I asked for a bigger bowl once I got someone's attention and also placed our dinner orders. About ten minutes later we got the pitcher of chicha, still no corn, about another 10 mins after that we got the appetizers, and finally the corn, which now I don't need because I have my appetizers. Calamari was decent, sliced octopus 6 small thin slices for $20, and the anticuchos were far from what an anticucho is supposed to taste like. No flavor what's so ever, I would've enjoyed a Grays Papaya hot dog more. Less than a minute later here comes dinner. I turned to the waiter and said ""we just got our appetizers"" he took our food back. After we finished with our appetizers maybe 7-8 mins later someone finally brings our food out. My octopus dryer than my grandma, and she's been gone 3 and half years now. That's what happens when there's no communication and your food has to sit under a heat lamp for 20+ mins. The ceviche, seem like they add water to their lime because there was almost no acidity to it and an overwhelming ginger taste. My little one has devoured any and every ceviche. This was the first time she didn't want to eat it. 5 minutes later we were still waiting for my fiancées ceviche, the over confidant waiter never put the order in. It's cool to write down orders, I don't know what this new thing is of wait staff not writing orders down and then forgetting to put it in. You know what's not cool? FORGETTING ORDERS!!! I was still hungry and thinking if we order desert and it's trash like the rest of our food, it's going to be a total bust for this place. Luckily the tres leches, bread pudding, and alfajores were delicious!! Hence the 2 stars. I asked for the check while my girls went to wash up and use the bathroom before we left. Here comes insult to injury, chicha $15, + $5 because I said no ice. So they charge you an extra $5 because you don't want ice! Highway robbery. I was never handed a paper receipt, the waiter had already entered his 20% tip on the bill which wasn't stated anywhere. $220 for trash, I felt robbed. Avoid this place it's a let down, I've eaten at the worst places Lima has and it's still better than this place, Service and food wise! The only communication this place has is between the wait staff and the outside world, waitress texting on her cell while taking an order to a table, another waitress with the AirPods in her ear. Reminds of when I'm in the operating room and these over confident incompetent nurses are looking at their social media during a surgery. Theo or whomever is in charge truly needs to get this place running right. Surprised you survived a pandemic with the mediocre food you serve and the lackluster wait staff that you have. I should've gone to Pio Pio they never disappoint."

My mom is extremely picky about Peruvian and whether it's authentic. I will say their food is AMAZING! My mom even agreed! I had the Kausa traditional without the ceviche on top. It was the best Kausa I've ever had! I was especially impressed with the purple sauce on the plate which tasted like the Peruvian olives. I also tried the Lomo Saltado which is probably the most authentic I have found. My mom loved their fish ceviche. I'm sad I don't live here because I would be at this restaurant all the time, but this gives me a reason to come back!"

As a Hell's Kitchen resident, I pass by this place all the time as I head to Central Park for runs. The interior is  cozy and laidback, but I ordered delivery my first time around - the half chicken and the mixed plate.These dishes deliver well. The 1/2 chicken is tender and authentic; there's not too many seasonings. I think Peruvian cuisine relies on sauces anyways: you dip the chicken into all these different mayo based (?) sauces. Great deal for that much protein. That mixed place is also good, but not for people who don't like sausage. I'm definitely planning on visiting in person and trying the other dishes."

The food wasn't bad, but the portion sizes are really small, especially for the price that we were paying. I also felt pretty rushed by the waitresses there. The food:Ceviche de Corvina: This one was my favorite. I really liked how zesty the dish was, and the different textures in the dish. This was also the biggest portioned dish we got.We also ordered a Kausa, but I don't remember exactly which one it was. This was pretty good, but so small. I did find the texture unique, but it wasn't worth the price tag.Tradito Exotico: This one was also good in terms of taste and texture, but i was again disappointed by the portion size. Wish we had gotten slightly more food.Overall, the food here is good, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a hearty meal. My friends and I all left still feeling pretty hungry."

It has been a go to for pick up, but the staff are really friendly and the atmosphere is cozy if you have time to stay for a meal. The ceilings are high and there is a great sushi counter if you are alone or just two. There is a great spot for a larger party at a table by the window. They are always playing up-beat music that is not too loud and lights that are warm and relaxing. The menu has good variety of authentic and playful items without the typical Americanized ""special rolls"" that smother the fish. They serve really fresh high grade fish that they know how to let it speak for itself. As a former sushi chef, this is my go to for sushi in the West Village."
2135,OjUw8sy1xpn_XwO4QaJoMA,11/19/2022,2 star rating,"Went here for the 12 piece omakase for $68. For the money, the pieces were very underwhelming. Nothing was bad, however the pieces did stand out.  The flavors of each piece were not complex whatsoever. Service from our waiter was very good and personable. The omakase was 45 minutes and it felt very rushed. You can see the sushi chef watching you as you eat to give you your next piece. We felt pressured to finish our pieces as soon as possible. Overall, with the lack of flavor, no specialty pieces, and rush, this was not worth the price. There are definitely many other better omakase places for this price point."
2136,OjUw8sy1xpn_XwO4QaJoMA,10/30/2022,3 star rating,"Food (omakase) was disappointing I am very sad to report . Maybe it was an off day, or maybe I've just been spoiled, but the rice was not balanced at all! The rice was overwhelmingly vinegar-ey and acidic, and totally washed out all the proteins, which themselves seemed fine. Very little wasabi between rice and protein. Soemtimes far too much salt and other bites had not enough. The consistently in size of fish/protein between myself and the other folks at the bar was huge. Staff behind the counter are nice. Server kept calling me sweetie in kinda a weird way. For the price I don't think I'll be back-- at $90 after tax and tip I think the area has a lot more to offer. I do like these cat chopstick holder though."

The takeaway is ""expect what you pay for - nothing more, nothing less"". The 12-piece speed omakase (45min) is worth the $58 (service-included) cost.However, I wouldn't recommend ordering any a la carte pieces as they can get quite pricey and not worth it at this restaurant (you can find better value sushi elsewhere in the city). The location itself is great, with the interior design fairly cozy with dimmed lights and music in the background.  The staff are more than friendly and greeted me with warm welcoming's.For me, don't think I'll need to visit again."

You get like sushi by Ms more responsible older sister from the outside. But, you just didn't put in the effort. My Omakase was standard at best. Nothing stood out.

I expect them to use either otoro or chutoro for their toro option, but it was akami that was in $42 maki which I couldn't believe it. The waiter mentioned that it should be otoro/chutoro when we asked to confirm. rice was undercooked and fell apart. I am also questioning.. if they are really using A5 wagyu because texture and flavor were not A5 wagyu at all.. normally chef would like to use a torch to cook wagyu.. but it looked like they boiled it or something. truffle stuff on wagyu had extremely unpleasant flavor (either it went bad or expired...?). we spent close to $300 including tips (25%)... but I can easily say we are not coming back. We had such a great experience when they first opened (great quality and quantity), but wow.. something was really off."

It literally tasted so bad I tossed it in the garbage.

The 2 square slices were cold yet under cooked and the chicken roll was cold yet burnt. Woman who took out pizza out of the oven needs to read order slips and learn what a raw pizza looks like verses a cooked pizza. And hot food needs to be better timed before boxed.  Go else where to a place that can hack a typical Friday night dinner time rush.  Hate to give a neighborhood business a bad review but with prices going up the way they are, not fair for anyone to spend so much money for inedible food."

2154,sswuN6W-p8wpIeQIoGuHmQ,2/28/2022,4 star rating,"I came here for a birthday dinner for two. We had tickets for the 8:30 show. If you are picky about seating, I recommend coming quite early. We arrived right on time and the tables were already filled with people. We had the option to sit in the middle section at the table farthest from the stage or closer to the stage, but with a side view. We opted for the middle section. Even though we were farther back, we still had a great view. The tables were quite close to one another so it made for a cozy environment. For food, the venue offered Southern and Cajun inspired fare. The menu was not very vegetarian friendly. There was a $20 minimum per person. I ordered the mac and cheese. The portion size was a bit on the small side. The breadcrumbs on top gave the dish a nice crunchy texture. Otherwise, it was nothing special. It had decent flavor, but wasn't very cheesy at all. My boyfriend got the baby back ribs and said they were tasty. They came with collard greens and potatoes. We also shared a bottle of wine. The show for the evening was the Big Chief Donald Harrison Quartet. They were fantastic. Each musician was clearly a master of his craft and played with passion. I was very impressed that Donald Harrison sang and played the saxophone and bongo drums. The band covered hits from several esteemed jazz artists. This venue has a strict quiet policy during performances. The staff will shush your table if they hear any talking above the music. There was another seating at 10:30 so they rushed us out at the end of the show so they could prepare the tables. Even though the set was great, it felt very short. I think the musicians only played about 5 songs before they had to wrap up. I would've liked more time to truly savor the experience. Given the iconic renown of this venue, I recommend it for a special occasion. You can find less formal places to enjoy great jazz elsewhere in the city, but this place is still worth it for the history."

Overall, the experience was more than worth it.It's funny to point this out, but the bathrooms were ridiculously cramped, to the point that people are bumping into you as you're peeing, and there's urine all over the urinal and floors. Not sure what happened with the designing of the bathroom.Staff was exceptional and friendly, particularly the bartenders, who served me. Tip them well!To be clear, the amazing live jazz, the history, and the staff make this place a 5+.

Sad that there's a minimum $20 per person for food/drinks, tho - honestly, we ended up spending way more than that so I shouldn't even be complaining about the minimum lol.The music was so good; I was literally thinking to myself how I should budget from now on to explore more jazz bars in NYC (the answer is that I probs can't). But anyways, the food wasn't bad either, and the service was great - we ordered 1 glass of wine among the 2 of us and the server offered to split it into 2 glasses for us instead of judging us - and I'm pretty sure she gave us more .So if you love jazz and vibes like me and like to entertain your mouth at the same time, give this place a try at least once!

SEATING - there is no assigned seating so if you come early on the line you'll get the close tablesSTAGES - there is an upstairs (bigger size) and a downstairs (smaller size)MENU - pretty limited and basic show or pub & grub. Tip: the downstairs menu is smaller but ask for items on the upstairs menu and they will accommodateAPPETIZERS - the BBQ wings were pretty bad. Very overcooked because they were reheated it seems. The BBQ sauce was thicker than the thickest I've ever had. The Blue cheese dip was awful. Also they made them spicy more like Buffalo style than BBQENTREES - wife had the mushroom risotto and it was not that good. The dish needed more liquid as the rice was seriously undercooked. The mushrooms made up for some of the disaster. I had the catfish which I can say the fish was excellent. However the rice was undercooked (I see a trend here), but the spinach was decent albeit unseasoned (at least sauté in garlic)VINO - the Cabernet at $45 a bottle tastes like a $7 bottle in a  vine store. Very thin with a super acidic taste. COCKTAILS - these were very good. Try the rum punchSERVICE - this was a 5 star  performance as everyone (waiter, bus, host) all at the top of their game. Unexpectedly congenital and talkative in a hustle and bustle environmentDESSERT there is no dessert menu so those with sweet tooth's need to order sweet  PRICE - excluding the show prices are in the upper $$$-$$$$ range.

First visit was off because it was fairly new and they didn't manage the CNY crowds well. This year, much better service by the wait staff. And the manager that took our order gave us reasonably priced suggestions rather than just upselling what they priced too high.I had a party of 8 and our dinner came to an economical total of $170 before tip. No soup and no pricey seafood, that was the strategy. Worked in our favor and everything tasted great!Dishes I'd recommend:- Sauteed rib steak with asparagus- clams with black bean sauce- fried tofu with the egg like batter paired with mushrooms, lotus root, and mixed veggies. The grey-ish sauce was delicious! (Likely that color because of the mushrooms and the veggies)- the Chilean Sea Bass (a little too heavy on the sauce but the fish is always meaty and tastes like butter). The sauteed purple onions complimented the dish nicely.While we ordered many other dishes, these were the ones we loved and finished. The rest was saved for leftovers. Still good the next day by the way.Side note: the twin lobsters I wanted to order was market price, $60 for two (Jan. 2020). You gotta be kidding me.

We asked to move table because of the light but the bored waitress told us we'd be able to see the light from the other tables. Ok. So we finally got given a menu and the prices were pretty steep for a chain cafe. We'd walked up from Battery and wanted a break so we ordered anyway.When it arrived, the tea tasted overly astringent as if it had been left to steep too long, after one of my party requested it to be 'weak' in strength. Where she could palate the flavour by adding milk, I couldn't, so I just beared it as hydration. We were going to order something to eat like a sandwich but decided against it as the staff seemed to already be doing their closing duties for the day and most of the blackboard had been cleared off that held the menu. We left feeling demoralised."

We made reservations for 3 at 5:30 on a Sunday. It was fairly busy, but not packed. We were seated right away. What we ordered: we started off with a little gem salad which was the perfect amount for us to split. (The bread they bring out to start the meal is absolutely heavenly, but we wanted some greens as well.) For our main we ordered the mushroom pizza with the cauliflower side. The cauliflower was good, but forgettable. The pizza had a delicious pesto-based sauce. The crowd here is very upper east side esque. You don't necessarily need to dress up to go here, but I wouldn't dress down. The service was so attentive and nice. Our experience at Upland was excellent and I highly recommend having a meal here."

We had:- Little Gem salad with avocado on the side - first salad had avocado even though we were clear about it being on the side. The second salad was delicious.- Burrata with country bread - delicious, we ask for more country bread, which we got after they took the burrata away.- Cacio Pepe - way too much pepper- Bianca Pizza - very good- Lemon Spaghattini - mascarpone cheese with shrimp doesn't work- Puttanesca - very good- Brussel Sprouts - delicious- Cookie Basket - very good- Carrot Cake - delicious- Chocolate Budino - very goodFor the price and the inconsistent service, this is a pass."

Inside the restaurant is amazing, but if the weather is right I would suggest sitting out on the front patio. They built a nice sectioned off area so that you can eat on the street, but not feel like you are sitting right next to another dinner party. It also has a tiny roof just in case it did drizzle, which we were lucky to avoid. Service was top notch and they were happy to give us some great suggestions on the food.In terms of food, there wasn't anything that we didn't enjoy. I would say if I was ranking the food, the skirt steak was at the top. It was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. The sausage pizza was also great. Not traditional New York style, but felt elevated. We had a pasta dish which was very yummy. Cacio E Pepe, One of the highest rated items on the menu, and it didn't disappoint. The corn side dish was amazing. Felt like an elevated street corn. We had the little gem salad, which was not pictured because we ate it so fast, and it was nice to have something green on the list. And finally the bread was amazing. I don't know if they cook it in house, but I would definitely recommend having a little bit of bread, but not spoil your appetite.5 out of 5 experience and will definitely come back to try the other dishes!"

We had a 2pm reservation-fully aware that lunch is only served until 3 (this will come into play in next paragraph) but the reservationist assured us this wouldn't be an issue. We had a male server (forgot his name) but very friendly, and personable. We ordered the little gem salad, the Bucatini Cacio e Pepe, the cookie basket, coffee and a Bloody Mary. Bloodies were very good, as was everything else.  Cookies were average though. Cacio and salad were large portions so brought some home and had it the next day. It seems as though our server was done for the day and we had a female bring us the check right after we had ordered dessert but hadn't  received it yet. I posted a pic of the receipt, the time stamp was 3:06. At 3:10, Cheri came over and asked us if we were ready to pay. Really? 4 minutes later and we were waiting for dessert...The restaurant stops serving lunch at 3-you think they lock the doors and are closed from 3-5pm (dinner begins at 5) by the way she was acting. Was she getting off work too? What was the hurry? I thought it was rude. A bad look. And if you see on the bottom of the check- they use a contactless payment system so.....anyway, food good, rush job, bad."

Although reservations can be difficult to get last minute, especially for dinner, if you go around brunch time you can usually get a seat at the bar where they serve their full menu. I've been here for a nice Sunday brunch a couple of times and I absolutely love it. To start, the Bloody Mary is phenomenal. And then the food, I've had their smoked salmon pizza, the California BEC, eggs Benedict, and pancakes. I'd say the smoked salmon pizza was one of my favorites--they absolutely nailed the crust and the toppings worked perfectly. The California BEC was another favorite, the flavors were delicious and melded together well. In regards to the eggs Benedict and pancakes, those were not my favorite and tasted like I could get them from most other standard brunch spots. This place is so worth coming to for the Bloody Mary and the pizza/BEC alone. Will definitely frequent this spot for brunch regularly!"

The chicken tastes much juicier.Today I had breakfast for the first time. For a more upscale fast food restaurant compared to McDonalds, I expect better quality. I ordered the chicken biscuit sandwich with hash browns and orange juice. The hash browns were average. Get chick fil a sauce with it! It won't disappoint. The chicken as always was juicy. The biscuit was lighter than McDonald's. I'd give this sandwich a legs up on McDonald's biscuit sandwich.Overall I recommend coming here for you chicken needs.

2197,qEbQbYZxurnuVxDrNHQUJg,6/22/2019,2 star rating,"It's a Chic-fil-A located across from Grand Central. If you don't  know what to expect, let's state the obvious...you live under a rock,  and have yet to experience legitimate chicken meals, a clean resturaunt, accomodating employees, and a good, square meal. With these standards upheld by every Chic-Fil-A I have ever visited, you'd expect this chicken lunch stop on the way to Yankee Stadium to be no different. But oh, it was. Nestled upstairs, in the back of the crowded dining area, was a table of employees on break. Noting wrong with that, other than the language that flowed from the mouth of the male who was holding court with the ladies, also on break. It made my curly fries curl, it made my lemonade pucker. Not what I would ever expect to hear- or expect my two sons to hear- in a chain that adheres to high standards.Not being from NYC, maybe this is how big cities roll. Maybe bucolic Lancaster PA has a different set of standards. While I might expect this in Times Square, it was not expected or appreciated. Definately an anomoly from all of my other Chic-Fil-A experiences.Food was good, prices were $2 per item more expensive than home, and the resturaunt was clean. Not so were the conversational colloquialisms,  which will be the memorable experience from this visit"

The waffle fries could have been a bit more crispy. Pro tip- They don't charge for dips, so get a ranch dip for your burger!"
2201,QbAfrOxbuYKU248SDXHZEQ,10/4/2022,5 star rating,"I came here last week for dinner with two friends. We had a  good time, and it was one of my friend's first time dining at a Michelin star restaurant. Reservations was not too hard to get, I think we booked one week in advance for a Wednesday 8pm spot. It is notable that they only do two seatings each day: 5pm and 8pm.Tsukimi is a very unique kaiseki experience that is elegant in its taste as well as its presentation. It is a 12 course meal that takes about 2-2.5 hours. They incorporate high quality expensive types of fish that is native to Japan into their dishes. The setup is an intimate 12 seats around the center island. All the courses are served at the same time, so it is imperative you are not late. There are servers around the restaurant that help assist you if you need any help with anything, and to give you undivided service.I am unsure on how frequently their menu changes. But we had their Fall Menu. All the dishes we had are included in the picture I uploaded. I enjoyed every single course. Rather than talking about the whole 12 courses; I will only mention the highlights just so I can save the experience for yourself. Highlights:- Madai, Heimloom Tomato, Finger Lime, Okra: Madai (or Sea Bream) was fresh and delicious and the accompanied citrusy profile made it a refreshing course. I love the incorporation of okra in this dish. This was as an aesthetic pleasing dish as it was to taste.- Nodoguro, Lotus Root, Sudachi: Nodoguro (blackthroat seaperch) is a very tender and flavorful fish, it is accompanied with a citrus slice and lotus root based soup. The soup is very hearty and is refreshing to the palate. Perfect dish to have with the recent drop in temperature. - Somen. Kaluga Caviar, Ezo Awabi. Uni. Tomato: This is an interesting combination of two very expensive components: Uni and Caviar. Usually I don't like the idea of them together since they both have very strong distinct flavors and would overlap. But oddly enough it worked okay. Of course. do try caviar and uni on it's own before you decide to mix the whole thing. Nevertheless, an explosion of umami in this course!- Duck, Shishito: I think this is the main course of the meal based on how it is placed right in middle of the 12 course meal, and as depicted as the ""full moon"" on the menu. I think this might be one of the best duck I've ever had! It has a smoky yet very tender flavor profile. The shishito puree also was as close to perfection as it can be. I personally LOVED the shishito puree. Definitely one of my favorite course that night!- Kimedai, Fennel, Yuzu. (8th photo): Kinmedai (golden eye snapper) is one of my favorite fish, and thus it has made my highlights. The fish skin is slightly seared to crisp. The fish itself is very juicy and full of flavor. The fennel and yuzu was a good pairing to balance the savory texture of the fish.Overall: We had a very good experience! The service was spectacular as expected from a Michelin rated restaurant. Our servers were knowledgeable and it made our experience much more enjoyable. Would highly recommend to anyone who's looking for fine dining w/ a great kaiseki experience!"
2202,QbAfrOxbuYKU248SDXHZEQ,9/18/2021,5 star rating,"Booked this place in May shortly after finding out it had earned a Michelin star. I emailed to make sure there was no pork on the menu (yay). Everything from the moment you walk in is perfect. The warm aesthetic, the wonderful servers, in the feel was perfect. (Of course the shop front isn't obvious at all). I enjoyed my meal with a sparkling yuzu drink that I would recommend to anybody because it was perfect with every single course.Every single course was phenomenal. My most memorable course was the yuzu fluke and bluefin tuna. By the time we reached the wagyu with egg yolk donburi I was already so full. Imo there egg yolk overpowered the flavor of the wagyu. I booked this place through tock and prepaid for the experience. If you order drinks, you'd have to pay for that after the meal. They also provide you a nice menu card at the end of the meal so you remember what you ate ^_~12/10 would recommend and come back again! Looking forward to their fall menu."
2203,QbAfrOxbuYKU248SDXHZEQ,2/11/2023,4 star rating,"I came to celebrate my birthday. The first course was pretty tasty with the three little bite. The second course the tuna was so fresh that you can taste there is a bit of sweetness coming from it when you bite into it.  the fluke wasnt my favorite as the fishas no flavor, but would taste very good if there is a sauce underneath the fish. The sablefish with soup was amazing, the fish is a little fatty and the soup was delicious. The uni dish was also amazing, the saltiness of caviar with perfectly cooked sushi rice with a little potato cruch to give it texture (best uni over rice I ever had so far) The duck was so tender I eneded up eating with the celery root on top with the sauce and it even made the duck taste even better.The amadai with yuzu sauce was very good as well and it came with cried mushroom which I am not sure how I feel I feel it wasn't a good pair would be better without the fried shitaki mushroom as the mushroom itself is small. I love beef especially a5 wagyu from Japan and I had eaten a few a5 wagyu as it usually melt in your mouth because they are fatty, they suggest you eat the wagyu with wasabi which interestingly does make it less fatty when you put it in your mouth and the tokyo scallion sauce was actually good. The eel also wasn't my favorite, while the rice with the soy raw egg was very good and the rice was cooked perfectly, the eel itself just taste like any other eel to me.The dining experience came with 3 different dessert.  My favorite would be the fig and chestnut and there is also red bean at the bottom and they give you a cup of traditionally made green tea to complment the red bean. I also really like the apple souffle and the early grey ice cream,  for the souffle is my first so I really have nothing to compare to but the favor was great. The early grey ice cream was pretty good. The strawberry milk was good but if the strawberry was diced and folded into the milky sorbert would have been even better but that just my opinion.The service here was great and they explain how everything is suppose to be eaten. They were all very nice. Somehow I wish that it was an open kitchen so I can see how they cook which would make it more interesting.All in all had a good time."

Arrived late as a main street was shut down in the late afternoon and took forever to get a uber/lyft. Flagged down a taxi and ended up being 10 minutes late.

2205,QbAfrOxbuYKU248SDXHZEQ,1/15/2022,5 star rating,"Brought my partner here last night for her birthday and we left already looking forward to our return. Behind the nondescript entrance is a culinary experience well worth the price per person and upfront service charge.  Upon entry, you're warmly greeted, quickly checked in (names, vaxes, etc.), and brought to your seats only feet away. A soothing eclectic mix of contemporary/pop elevator music tests your knowledge of songs and is played at a volume loud enough to discern the song, yet low enough to hear a little of the other diners' conversations.  It appeared to be couples night as the couples' chairs were nicely spaced from adjacent couples with 6 chairs each along 2 bar-type counters looking across from each other.  There were 2 empty seats, so only 10 diners showed for the dinner. Drink service is prompt and there is a nice selection of sakes, wines and 5-6 different beers.  We had tap water, a bottle of sake and I had a bottle of Baeren Schwarz black lager. The diversity of courses kept everything interesting and the creativity with each dish demonstrated forethought that some other michelin starred restaurants fail to show (inadvertently or otherwise). Our 3 favorite dishes were (not in any order):-The uni, which was creamy and briny over an egg, potato and rice concoction that had a hint of cheese flavor topped with a full teaspoonful of Osetra caviar!  A nice mix of basic and extravagance! -The Dungeness crab bits in a warm chowder/soup comprised of mainly an egg custard-like base with shaved lily bulbs on top.  A nice winter dish and warm in the belly! -The Wagyu was cooked medium rare and had some fat that was delicate and flavorful with horseradish sprinkled on top.  Underneath was white rice with an egg yolk.  This was the last savory dish and I was almost full before this point.  This definitely satisfied the carnivorous part in me! Overall, we were very pleased with each dish's novelty and creativity and the ingedients were top notch (some main proteins were imported directly from Japan)!  The service was on point, napkins were replaced, and water glasses were always filled.  The whole experience was intelligently planned and the menus were a nice added touch and nicely presented.  I could see a 2nd michelin star added in the future! Btw, the restroom is super clean! Sorry if the pics are out of order...I can't figure out yelp's ordering system."

My sister has been dining here for quite a while prior to Tsukimi gaining their  well deserved star. We made plans to come here for my birthday months in advanced, hyped up and even more hyped up since gaining their star! I love Japanese cuisine and have been meaning to try out more kaiseki course offerings.Let's just say Tsukimi did not disappoint. Each course in their October menu was a party in my mouth. Staff was equal parts professional, friendly, and perceptive to our needs. If I were to rate each course, I would say it just gets better and better as it progresses. We were seated closest to the kitchen which I absolutely appreciated as I love peeping at chefs (maybe to steal some chef secrets... ). My favorite dishes were the dessert courses of course!The apple souffle dish that was baked using a whole cored fuji apple and the paired potato chip ice cream was exceptionally divine! ProTip: when they ask you if you want still or sparkling, say TAP. Because NYC tap is amazing... and let's be real, we're all bougie for coming here but not bougie enough for $15 bottle of water :D"

And soon they did. This third time there, and I predict they will receive their second Michelin Star in the not too distant future. They have upped their game a couple of notches!  Most memorable for me was the desert: a banana soufflé baked inside a hollowed out banana! Absolutely mind blowing concept, taste, and presentation. Other dishes also very memorable: razor clams, lobster bisque, yellow fin tuna tartare, their signature uni with caviar. I can't wait to see what they will come up with next!"

Don't be late, or they will start without you.  And believe me, you will not want to miss a single morsel. Every single course was exceptional. The pacing is perfect. The staff was friendly and professional. It is almost impossible to pick favorite courses, but the uni, caviar, egg, potato, and rice was divine. Also, the wagyu beef was like a religious experience.  I never wanted the flavor to leave my mouth.  The main dessert course was a revelation. Green apple soufflé served in the apple with potato chip ice cream. The soufflé was ethereal and the ice cream was mind blowing. Green apple and potato chip is the pairing you never knew you needed. While they offer a wine and sake pairing, we had very delicious great tea. I thought it was a great non alcoholic alternative. This was a lovely and tranquil dining experience. The twelve courses lasted 2.5 hours yet you never wanted it to end because it would somehow break the spell. We cannot wait to go back with the change of season."

I think they switch up their flavors every week but they always have the plain yogurt which is my favorite. It comes out looking like a lot but the center of the froyo is empty which disappoints me every time I get there since I would want more.The prices are fairly decent and you can add toppings for extra, I have yet to add any toppings since I feel like just the yogurt itself is so satisfying.

So many people deemed this as tue besy frozen yogurt place in NYC, so I had to take the opportunity and try this place out (with a fairly full stomach). I got the smallest size of plain low fat yogurt, which was pretty expensive, $6.53 after tax. There are dry and fresh toppings available, ranging from $1-$2. Forty Carrot isn't a cheap dessert spot. But the portion I received was huge. The yogurt tasted great, not overly sweet and was sour too. It didn't taste artificial or like ice cream at all. I could definitely tell that it's yogurt if someone just gave me that cup. Hehe. Anyway, I still managed to finish the whole cup because I didn't want to waste money. This is by far the tastiest frozen yogurt I've tried in NY! It's a shame that they only open inside Bloomingdales."

This place has gone downhill over the years sushi quality has dropped as well as a few other things. it's sad to see a neighborhood staple decline like this. I realize there's more important things going on in the world I know -but if we're talking about this specific place I would go elsewhere!!! also very nasty response when you try to get your message across or get credited for stuff -They actually hung up on us when we were asking questions about getting our money back!  just lame all around don't go here it's a ripoff!!

We got the pork katsu which was fried to perfection, the white tuna and salmon nigiri, Japonica roll, crab and avocado roll and the scallop roll (both raw and cooked) personally, I would recommend getting the raw fish because they're all more fresh!

The miso soup was very hot and yummy.  The place offers a seating area outside and just a few tables inside."

Originally, I found it over priced given the quality, but it was an easy neighborhood sushi spot for fine sushi. However, it's recently taken a terrible turn for the worse. My appetizer Oshitashi smelt and tasted like fish (this is a dish of boiled spinach...)Sushi is now all pre cut, tasteless and sub par. I even noticed the sushi chef questioning the look of certain pieces and even throwing some out.In short, ownership is completely checked out and doesn't care about quality or delivering a good experience to their clientele. It's very obvious. I would avoid eating here at the risk of getting sick and/or over paying for mediocre (at best) food. Go somewhere (anywhere!) else."

Our family loves great food and trying new places, but we come back to Japonica regularly, because it's something that delights us all, every time. Try the Chirashi sushi. The unagi. Even their green salad is delicious. It's small, humble, and dedicated to the craft they do. I hope it will stay around for another 30 years..."

But finally we have decided after tonight that we will no longer go to this restaurant, especially since there are way better restaurants in the area with staff and management who actually know how to do their jobs.           We ordered nachos that never came out until we asked where they were and then finally came out after the food. Our burgers and fries were ice cold so they said they would recook them. They came back out again literally Ice cold. The server asked how they were and we said they are still ice cold but we will just eat them since we didn't want to be waiting for our food all night. The restaurant manager then came up and said sorry and offered us a drink and we said we didn't want to drink anymore. They brought one drink anyway even though we said we didn't want one which was very uncomfortable. They did not discount the bill what so ever. As we left we told the manager that it was absolutely crazy that she didn't discount the bill at all when the food was absolutely awful, then the server walked up and explained that she did discount the bill but that The managers took off her automatic gratuity as a discount instead of actually discounting the meal. We found this absolutely disgusting and outrageous that a manager/ owner would ever treat their employees and customers like we saw tonight. This place should definitely find some new people to run it. We will never be returning to this place and neither should you."

Went back on a Friday night with a few friends and everything was pretty good. So on a lazy Sunday afternoon I order a burrito and guacamole to be delivered. The order came fairly quick and they got it right. Unfortunately, the guac was bland. I had to add some salt, lemon and picante. The burrito was probably the second worst burrito I've ever had. Not due to taste, it was ok, but due to size and how it wrapped. Or wasn't I should say. The burrito was about the size of a taco and a half. It was completely unwrapped on one end and the inside barely had any meat. Completely disappointed with the meal and myself for a wasted $18.50. I guess that's what I get for being lazy. I won't go back or ever order again."

I got their black sugar boba and pearl milk with cream mousse and it was interesting having two different sizes of pearls and boba throughout the entire drink. I think next time I'd just get the boba though. I still prefer having the flavor and chewiness of the boba. The brown sugar and milk is heavenly, paired with the perfectly chewy boba. At some boba places, the amount of brown sugar flavor is pitiful, and that's definitely not the case at Tiger Sugar. Every sip is full of brown sugar and pairs wonderfully with the milk and boba.After you take pictures, don't forget to shake your drink before you poke your straw in. A few of my friends forgot and struggled to mix it after their straw was in."

I don't typically order drinks that are that sweet, but I decided to splurge a bit and try it out. Fortunately the drink wasn't overly sweet, the milk balances with the brown sugar syrup and the pudding adds a nice sweetness and soft consistency. I do think Tiger Sugar is a bit overhyped and the drink was also pretty expensive. I also ordered when there was only one person in front of me and yet the drink took a bit long to come out. The cashier wasn't that friendly and didn't have the best attitude. I don't think I'll get Tiger Sugar again, it is more of a place where you try once just to see the hype."

You order outside, where they have a window to the cashier and then wait for your order number to pop up on the display. It's super simple to them pick up with the same cashier. It's right by the metro station, which is nice. Also, they don't take Apple Pay so make sure you have a card."

The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because after I told the lady in the window my order, I stopped to glance at the menu to ""possibly"" add another drink to my order and she rushed me!She said HEY HEY put your card and pay. I was really taken backShe clearly saw me LOOKING at the menu. She was extremely rude! On the other hand, it's a tiny window that you line up on the sidewalk and place your order. You have to wait for your number to be called to pick up your order. I ordered the two signature drinks"

It's in a building, a small room with just enough space for the staff and area to make their drinks. They only take orders from their window outside. This location was easily spotted by a huge crowd and line waiting to order or for their drinks. The line was long on both days but it moves.Brown Sugar Black Tea with Boba- It has a distinct sweet caramel flavor blended with creamy milk and chewy tapioca balls. I rarely get boba in my drinks but this was a real treat! Everything about this drink is amazing!Overall Service: Dealing with the volume of customers hours long, I'm surprised the staff managed to maintain a pleasant demeanor! As long as you know what you are getting and your wallet is out, you can quickly order, pay and move out of the way for the next person. There's a number on the receipt and the number will prompt on the panel by the window, they will also shout out the number. A little chaotic with everyone lingering but it's worth it!"

There are so many restaurants in the area trying to be bars, but Lock Yard stays true to the beer lovers and clearly has given a lot of thought into creating a space where people want to come, sit down, and enjoy a drink.We stopped by on Bay Ridge St. Patty's Day and I'm really happy we did. I loved the festive, quirky setup here and the crowd was a cool mix of 30 somethings. No super young kiddies here which I can appreciate. Service was fast and friendly, and I even spied an outdoor seating area that I can't wait to take advantage of in the warmer months.I heard the bar food is great here too. So excited to come back!"

The menu looks great: 6 hotdog specials all around $5, 3 burger options & 4 sandwich baskets options that come with fries (between $12-$13). Beer options on tap look appealing and beer selection apparently changes regularly. I split the Seattle Sound Hot dog (w/ rc cola caramelized onions, cream cheese, banana peppers, everything bagel seeds, sriracha aioli). It was delicious! If we didn't have dinner plans, I would have ordered more.Didn't get to see the outdoor/backyard area but that's always a plus.If I lived nearby, I can image I'd be coming pretty frequently. Seems like a great neighborhood bar."

I was diggin the vibes of the music that the bartender was playing. Ska bands from back in the day and bit of late 90s punk and alternative.   wings were perfect. Best wings I've had in Bay Ridge. I also highly recommend the Seattle Sound. It was the most unique hot dog I've ever had with such an incredible blend of sweet, salty, creamy and crunch.  Don't let the thought of cream cheese on a hot dog scare you away. You'll love it I swear. Only thing I'd pass on is the margaritas as they were a little too sweet for my taste personally. I usually like a more sour kick with a salty rim, but I gotta say the presentation was great. Great beer selection as well.Also I just want to say that I really appreciated that the bartender gave us a heads up that the meal came with fries cuz otherwise we may have ordered way too much. Fries were also delish, I guess they are cottage fries thinly cut circles perfectly crisp and mushy on the inside."

It took over 1 hour for us to receive our orders..ridiculous. Place wasn't even that busy!!! The fried pickles are an interesting concept except it's too difficult to eat. Not shareable since it's sliced the long way rather than the normal circular shape fried pickles typically come in. The entire crispy crust falls off after one bite, probably not enough flour. The Hot Mess was missing the sweet potato tater tots. My order only came with soggy french fries. Also, the exterior of my beyond burger was super burnt. I'm still trying to get rid of the burnt food taste from my mouth. Why did I eat it is beyond me but I regret not returning that dish.  I don't recommend getting Bay Ridge Ripper Hot dog. The hot dogs from the hot dog stands taste better than this."

I've come a handful of times in the past and I've gotten their veggie hot dog (which is also wonderful). I've had some not-great beyond burgers at other places (if they're over cooked, they lose their flavor), so I was a bit nervous, but it was hands down best burger of my vegetarian life. Even my boyfriend (who does eat meat) said he would come back just to order it. Other things to note-- they have an interesting and ever-evolving beer list, they're patient and will give you tastes if you know nothing about beer (me), and they have a lovely little patio area that is heated in the cold months."

I recommend the vegetables, lamp, tofu slides, and chicken wings. Don't really recommend the pot cuz it doesn't taste as flavorful as the BBQ ones. We come here only for BBQ, not for the fried rice, dumpling or wonton... I have to say those fried rice or dumpling wonton soup are pricy for what you'll get.. but like I said, it's not a place for those type of food. It's just a simple Chinese style BBQ place. The waitress is very sweet and always offer me the warmest seats when I went in a cold winter day. I really like their BBQ!"

(THEY CHARGE 1.50$ FOR ONE SINGLE TINY CHICKEN WING)Sadly to say, I left the restaurant still pretty hungry. The portions were tiny. Honestly I'm better off going to Beijing style BBQ (my regular spot they welcome byob) 2 blocks away from here. I would spend less,  eating their bigger skewers while drinking  2-3 coronas and leave full and happy. Also this place isn't BYOB which is major let down. Wont be a returning patron."

I stated in the notes to not forget to add beef and to make it spicy. Well guess what, it wasn't spicy and they charged me $3.00 extra for extra beef. I never added the word extra. Sometimes when you order anything with beef or shrimp, they lack with the protein. Sometimes even adding like 5 pieces. Which is why I said don't forget to add beef. I never stated once EXTRA. This restaurant is UNPROFESSIONAL. If you were to add an extra fee, please call the customer to clarify. You cannot just assume on someone's order. I called the restaurant and the lady started yelling at me saying I WAS WRONG. I asked to speak to the manager and her voice got lower. She had no idea of the managers whereabouts apparently. Horrible customer service. I ordered the beef Pad Thai Noodle and it was completely watery as ever. There was hardly any noodles. It was so watery that the flavors weren't there and it wasn't spicy. The beef was overwhelming. And don't get me started on the lime, It was brown, it was old. Also the Thai ice tea was watered down. Please don't order from here."

The sauce and cheese ratio is perfect too. Just writing this review is making me drool a little...The owner is super nice too. He will keep your pie warm for you (in the oven) if you call ahead to pick up. I'm definitely a fan and this place is on my speed dial.

One of the reasons I love living in this neighborhood is because of all the small businesses.

Three of us chose the stuffed branzino special- which was plated beautifully and tasted even better. The braised short ribs and polenta, seafood pasta and salmon were also ordered.

The fresh tortellini toscanini was pretty good as was the rabbit entree over polenta. My fresh fettuccine was meh. For the wines, I enjoyed the Montepulciano. Sauvignon blanc was okay.

I'm from NY originally but moved to the West Coast many years ago. I was visiting NYC for my girlfriend's birthday and she was set on having Italian food. I saw that Osteria 106 had good reviews so we decided to give it a try.The restaurant was packed on a Saturday night which was great! The service was impeccable. The food was brought out at a good pace - not too fast, not too slow. And all the diners seemed to be having a great time. The vibe was fantastic! This restaurant felt so New York and reminded me of what I missed about living there. The food was pure perfection. Even something as overdone as a calamari appetizer had a nice twist on it with fried apple slices and zucchini, and was not greasy at all - it was fried to perfection and delicious. My girlfriend got the eggplant ragu pasta; I'd like to tell you how it tasted but I can't because she finished it before I could even ask for a bite! And I had the seafood paccheri, which again, was absolutely incredible. We had the tiramisu for dessert with some espresso and the perfect night was complete.We've already been talking about coming back to NYC this Summer and how we will be back at Osteria 106 on our first night in town!

We were seated really quickly, and even though they were short staffed at the time, the food came out quickly, and the servers were super friendly. I had the Ravioli Di Zucca and Fettuccini Alla Bolognese for mains. The ravioli had a butternut squash filling and a heavy cream based sauce. I am an absolute sucker for sweet and savory combinations done well, and this was delicious. The Fettuccini was a classic Bolognese, and was also really well done.For dessert, I had the Molten Lava Cake. The chocolate oozed out as I got through the dish, and it was so good.I would recommend everything I ordered to anyone trying this for the first time, but I will definitely be back to try the rest of their menu!"

My mushroom, prosciutto tortellini was fantastic. I loved the creamy pink sauce and chunky mushrooms.

The wine glasses are averagely priced ($14 per glass) but we did notice they bring out decanters if you order bottles, which is super nice.We got the veal and fish specials, and they were super tasty. The veal was perfectly cooked and delicious with the salad it was paired with, and the fish went really well with the mashed potatoes. The prices were a little high for Italian food in the upper west side ($120 for 2 plates, 2 glasses of wine, and coffee) but I think it was worth it.Definitely worth a visit!"

I'm simply laughing in covid's ugly face!When one door closes another opens up... across the road. We left a spot at 10/11pm and walking past Izzy on the way home realized ""HEY, Izzy's still open!"" AND the really engaging barman said they close around 2am! So wootWOOT! Had a few at Izzy's large, beautifully covered but still open-air backyard. I heart that there are so many plants back there too. I would really like to see it in daylight. I was hungry (again) and tried their... shxt, what was the name of it? It's like a pattie made with soy. I guess a soy pattie?Never mind me, I'm rambling to make this review longer because for some reason my short reviews don't post. Smh. Anyway, Izzy Rose is nicely decorated inside and out back and even out FRONT on the pavement. Staff extremely welcoming AND they open late.I absolutely encourage you to give 'em a try.

A plant-based (read: vegan) bar with tacos, salads, and small bites. Service is a bit slow (much like Clementine ). But everyone is nice. Super nice (again, like Clementine). Tiki drinks, airy/modern/rustic chic decor with Instagram lighting. Cocktails are incredible but substitutions are frowned upon. Guacamole and chips were ok but needed salt and hot sauce to satisfy. Will be back."

I live nearby and have been coming to this place since before it was this millennial utopia. The bar is beautiful but every time I come, there is sourpuss behind the bar. Today I came around 5pm for a relaxed drink but was barely received in a warm welcoming way. After I finished my drink I went up to get another, but the bartender saw me then took her time to finish a conversation with a customer before acknowledging me. I decided not to order another and gave her no tip which is crazy because I used to work in the service industry and I have never done that to anyone.Please tell that bartender to work on her people skills. What is the attitude for? You are pouring drinks not curing cancer. Sorry I don't look like your desired customer. We all come in to support the struggling bar/restaurant industry. I could easily buy a nice bottle of wine for the price of a glass. I love this neighborhood please don't detract from it."

I usually don't hang around the Clinton Hill area but on this specific night I found myself grabbing drinks with a friend and choosing this place without ever having visited. I'm happy I did because it certainly has the best of both worlds. They've got outdoor spaces in the front and in the back. Their back outdoor space is massive and is definitely great for parties of four or more if you're looking to have drinks in a relaxing setting. They also have a policy of ordering your own drinks at the bar so no need to rely on waiting staff if the space is packed! Prices were reasonable and the vibes were good. Again, I'd come here with a group of friends or even on a date night. If you're nearby and looking for a good bar, go here!"

There were many cocktails I wanted to try but I went with the mezcal Triple Scorpio and it did not disappoint! Beautifully presented, I drank it in about 5 minutes because it was so delicious. Also had the nachos, which were tasty. Would love to see more IPA options on draft!"

Izzy Rose seems like it was made just for me. The smell of sage welcomed us as we entered, a nod to their appreciation for the mystical. The drink names keep with the theme, as does the plant-based menu. My partner got the delicious Triple Scorpio drink, which was well-made. The nachos were delicious. It's tricky finding a place with vegan food and cocktails, but they've hit the nail on the head at Izzy Rose.The decor and overall vibe of this place is great for a date night. The dark lighting where you and your beau will be surrounded by plants was truly romantic. We also enjoyed the music played, and the staff was kind. We are thinking of going back again next week already, if not sooner!"

There are plenty of seats in the front, the bar area and then a really small outdoor space that I believe was covered. Towards the front lights created a nice ambiance. Very intimate spot on an unassuming block and that alone makes this place a gem. The music was real soulful: lots of Motown, Stevie Wonder and R&B. Not at all what I expected from this. I say this not stereotype or type cast but the bartender and all the patrons were white. Bartender was a sweetheart who offered to create a drink for me and my friend. Turned out to be quite nice wow we had another. We got stuck in the rain and that made me see how this could've easily been a super romantic moment had I been there on a date. I will def go back to check it out before summer is over but I can see how this could be the perfect little nook for a cold winter night with the right one ."

They've cleared away their outdoor dining space from the summer and fall so I recommend doing pickup or delivery from them!Was craving butter chicken so I ordered that, and was also intrigued by all the different naan varieties they had to offer. Chicken tikka naan sounded too interesting to let it slide so I added that to my order. Definitely did not disappoint. Cracking open the container for the butter chicken had the butter floating upwards, a yellow spool in orange, like a yolk -- so I knew it would be good. Rice and sauce were packed separately so the rice wouldn't get soggy, too. While the chicken wasn't standout, the sauce was so buttery and creamy, exactly what I was looking for, that it more than made up for it. Definitely my go-to. The naan was an interesting flavor, though a bit dry for my taste. Portions were amazing. Sauces they came with were excellent as well.Would recommend calling in advance to place your order -- we were walk ins and waited outside to mitigate pandemic risk, and it was a significant wait to get our food. Understandable since they seemed quite busy -- several delivery people cycled in and out as we waited -- so order in advance to cut down on some of that wait time."

While it was empty, as most restaurants seek to be this holiday weekend, it didn't mean that walk ins were not welcome. And when you taste the food you know why. The crispy outer layer of the samosas and the yummy onion chutney make this place a go to spot for the quick indian food you need. Combined with papadam and sides this place hits all the flavor needs. Now, if you don't mind me... I'm just going to lay down in a food coma and be happy."

It had some nice whole chillies, the mango pickle, and a nice thick gravy. I was expecting it to be a little spicy and it wasnt but that was ok. The side chutneys included were good and I used them to kick it up. However, For $16 there were only 4 shrimp and the ""rice pudding"" was basically liquid.  I would come here again, . . .

I waited another 35 minutes (total wait of 1hr 45 min by now) and called back only to be given the same ""were busy"" answer.

They always made great Indian food, however after this and my last and this experience I regret to say it will be my last. Last order I had the app and entree deal with chicken vindaloo. I know how spicy vindaloo is. They sent something that was not edible. It was intentional. I was a sous for years. No one makes anything that spicy unless they're trying to prove something or just don't know what they're doing. I called and complained and told them the same information I just gave you. They offered me a $50 discount on my next order and said they'd make it up to me, as I ordered from them all the time.Flash forward 3 weeks. I go to redeem my grievance and they say that's ridiculous and it was 50% off. That doesn't take the burning shits I had away for two days. All I wanted was the $18.95 app and entree deal and they couldn't make good on that. I felt the need to say something cause this place is full of shit. Go to Bombay Grill. It's cheaper and there's no need for this hassle. Bottom line is, if you want real Indian food in Brooklyn, learn to make it yourself."

I ordered the combo of one appetizer, one entree and naan for 17.95, which I thought was a little pricy to begin with. I got the vegetable samosas and Chana masala. I also ordered a mango lassi. The mango lassi saved the meal because the rest was not great. The samosas were okay, but nothing to write home about. The naan was weirdly undercooked and doughy, so it was chewy in a way I've never experienced with naan. The Chana masala had so much coriander in it that I couldn't finish it. It was super lemony tasting and the coriander seeds were overwhelming to a point I couldn't taste the other flavors.  All in all I wouldn't order from them again."

I'm not very hard to please when it concerns sweets but wow this bakery is nothing what it was in the past. I used to visit this bakery for years and the goods never tasted this bad. Everything tasted different and off. Whatever changes they made were not for the better. The worst was the black and white cookie. It was big in size but I couldn't even eat it, it tasted that bad. The Italian cheese cake that used to be my favorite item from them tasted very bland and off as well. I will not purchase any goods from them in the future."

However, good service equates to a happy customer at times.I've been going here since 2001, pretty long time ago. There was always a rude Italian women there, but always a helpful crew came to compensate. They always had a good cake or pastry to serve. Years later, the management change. I heard this place is owned by Trinicity from various people ( not sure if that's correct, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm just going to say that the new staff is pretty rude, and the pastries aren't as good as they used to be.There was a woman with glasses who kept screaming what to me, or if I was done. I was only there for three minutes. I was pricing off the cakes and other goods, which have doubled. However, maybe they still had good treats and I was wrong. The ladies gave me the weirdest looks, every time I asked for a price. I just felt like an annoyance after and purchased what I wanted. When I came home the treats were rock solid and burnt on the edges, I didn't expect that especially for the money. Bottom line is, that good service and good food go hand in hand. They can compensate for each other, but truly they depend off each other. Not sure if I'm ready to return, I feel a little reluctant."

Mind you, I was only ordering 2... one.... two, lace cookies and a little piece of cherry bread.   He supposedly translated for a lady (didn't go well), the lady was getting the same treatment as me and somehow knew I spoke Spaninsh.  I translated for her, she was disgusted with the nonchalantness as well.  I purchased the little things I picked out and ended up on the bus with the same nice lady.  I bit the cookie, and was ready to spit it out.  The ultra sweet lace cookies (they said no nuts were in the cookies, there are) were awful, super glad they were cheap.  The bf said the cherry cheese roll was dry and flavorless, much like the service.  I gave them 2 stars because they are very nice to regulars and customers that are not different from themselves, if you get my drift.  Will bot be going back."

They've recently reopened for takeout, offering new items, their usual menu items, as well as some meal kits.Before pandemic, when dining in was an option, it was always so busy in here. Super family friendly as well, so it was always better to get here earlier than later. Some of my favorites off the menu included the Eggs Amatrciana American Style, Cheddar Chive biscuit, Smoked Salmon sandwich, Omelet, Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, and Avocado Toast. Some of these items aren't currently available, but they still offer a bunch of other items, mostly sandwiches and pastries. I enjoy their sandwiches, which are served on a croissant or biscuit. The Cheddar Chive biscuit might be my favorite go to item. It's also great for reheating. Their pastries are all amazing. The owner here is super nice and the staff is always welcoming. They've recently offered some other special items, including Korean bbq kits, lemon ricotta pancake kit, and hot dogs/hamburgers for Memorial Day. The Korean bbq kit is definitely worth it if you're dying for some bbq. It's been too long going without some decent Korean bbq, and you'll be surprised. This kit might taste better than some restaurant bbq I've had.  The lemon ricotta pancakes are also fantastic. These kits are super easy to cook up as well."

I sat at the bar and ordered a drink and when I got it I noticed that there was a ring at the bottom of the glass, I thought it would've been from when he poured the drink so I asked for paper napkins to clean the table and within a few minutes I saw a ring under my glass again so I thought that's quite strange, so I picked up the glass and when I did I CUT MY HAND!! The drink was leaking because the glass was CRACKED!!!! I told the waiter and he was sorry, but he didn't really do anything about it. After that happened, he disappeared and I got a new waiter who had no clue about what had happened. I asked for the Salmon Paradise and I never got my miso soup that is included with the meal. I later asked for my food to be boxed and when I got home there was no soy sauce when I specifically asked him to put packets of soy sauce in the to go bag. When I received the check, I was expecting that AT LEAST I'd get my drink as complimentary since I CUT MY HAND with their glass, but nope! Not even the drink!! Paid the entire check, had to sign it with my left hand because I couldn't even hold the pen with my right hand. So the place is fine, sushi is good (pricey but I guess it's ok for NYC) but my review is low ONLY because I wasn't expecting to go have dinner and end up getting injured. They should check their dishes after they clean them to make sure they're not a hazard for the customers."
2383,btLgjl8CEgW2wvB0ZI-Aqg,10/24/2022,5 star rating,Delicious especially on this rainy night. They also have a sushi bar. Very filling. A little noisy but we'll appointed restaurant.

I found the perfect place. It can be casual but still has an elevated feel. I sat by the window and people-watched with great natural lighting. I ordered miso soup and ""the monkey"" special roll. It really hit the spot! This roll is my new favorite and I'll be back again as it's close to my office. Service was quick and attentive. Noise levels were not crazy even as the restaurant filled up. Solid sushi joint."

The service is probably the best we have had at NYC. The sushi is fresh and delicious, and the miso soup and udon are flavorful and hearty. We will definitely be back!"
2387,btLgjl8CEgW2wvB0ZI-Aqg,1/29/2023,1 star rating,"In the spring of 2022, I ordered delivery twice from this restaurant.  The first sashimi order, although soup was cold and not very tasty, the sashimi was very good.  The second order, I had some issues with freshness.  Yesterday I personally went to Sushi Damo for lunch, and the sushi was awful.  Needless to say, I will never order from this restaurant again.The restaurant itself is pleasant and nicely decorated.  They have a sushi bar, an alcohol bar, & tables placed along the windows.  I sat at the sushi bar.  I was the only person at the sushi bar; there was one guy at the alcohol bar, and about 4 tables of other patrons.  The greeters & waiters were pleasant and super nice.  There were 4 sushi chefs at a small sushi bar, and one of them said hello, but that was it.  They just made sushi and didn't interact with the customers.I ordered a large hot sake, akadashi soup, a spider roll and a passion roll.  The sake was good, but more like a regular than a large size, the soup was mostly broth with a few mushrooms & onions - boiling hot.  It took me 5 minutes before I could even eat it.  I know soup should be hot, but this was ridiculous.  Although the presentation was good, the rolls were terrible (the worst sushi rolls I've had in my entire life, and I have been around for a long time).  The spider roll contained very little soft shell crab, and it was so cold, it seemed they had just defrosted it.  The roll was overall totally tasteless with no thought about any sauce they should have used.  The passion roll was small pieces of salmon wrapped around rice & seaweed with some kind of ""salad"" and mashed fish on the inside - again pretty tasteless.  Also the seaweed was not chewable.  These rolls were shaped like hearts and looked inviting, but the looks were deceiving.  I basically ate as much of the fish as I could of both rolls and left the rest.  Also, the rolls were very expensive ( $15 for one and $22 for the other).  All I can say again is AWFUL!"
2388,btLgjl8CEgW2wvB0ZI-Aqg,3/17/2023,5 star rating,Amazing sushi and great service. I ordered the miso soup and it was great! For desert we tried the tempura ice cream and it was the best desert ever!

2399,wO9FMvtYqsJoYrnHDASE0A,7/29/2011,5 star rating,"I've been coming to Northside Bakery since 2009 and I have to say, this place is as good as it gets! My boyfriend works a few blocks away, so we come here for lunch and dinner often, I'd say once a week...and I love this place. The women who work behind the counter are friendly, and quick, and offer service in both Polish and English (I speak only English)...from the four daily soups (I recommend the red borscht or the white vegetable) to the delicious pierogies (vegetarian with potato or meat-filled) to the amazing selection of by-the-pound sides, this place will fill you up for such a perfect price, that its a wonder you can always find a place to sit inside. We usually go with the stuffed cabbage, cheese pierogies, red beet salad, saurkraut, roasted potatoes, and blintzes for dessert, all of which are stand out (and this coming from a gal who grew up with two Polish grandparents). They also have great pastries and cakes, being that they are the Northside bakery...I recommend the vanilla wafer cookies and the homemade brown bread. Just for an example of how crazy inexpensive this place is: Tonight, we shared a large piece of stuffed cabbage with all the aforementioned fixings (4 pierogies, 2 kinds of salad, and 5 potatoes), plus two glasses of fruit juice (SO REFRESHING!), and two blintzes and a bag of cookies to take home...all for $15. So if you're in Greenpoint, make yourself happy, go to Northside Bakery."

Outside was already over 90 degree. They should keep the AC's temperature lower.

Mixed the coffee with the ice cream (mmmm) then I left and went to CVS. Like 30 minutes later I realized I didn't have my backpack with me and started freaking. So I called Cold Stone asap and asked if I left it there. Luckily the manager said he saw it and asked how the heck I didn't realize I had it because it's so incredibly heavy... And said he had it behind the counter. He is a life saver and I seriously owe him a lot. My laptop and hard drives and footage I shoot for my work was in there. I'd be totally screwed if I lost that. Cold stone is great and the manager is the best manager I've interacted with in service and niceness in Nyc! Thank you"

I bought this for an event and all the guest were alarmed by the taste. I hope that none of my guest will become ill due to Cold Stone's lack of quality control. This is the first time I've ever experienced this and I hope that Cold Stone will make an effort to ensure that this doesn't happen to future patrons.Furthermore, the cold stone website doesn't allow me to make a complaint on the site, I'm not sure if it's servers are down, but the complaint page will not load."

2421,U_OFOSHg6vt-oG2IzCkhww,2/21/2022,3 star rating,"I thought the grub was fine, my brunch partner really liked it. In fact, they claimed that if they found a hair they'd keep eating - a very uncharacteristic ... and prescient.There was a general laxity; the front of house staff were super nice, but not necessarily there to make the place shine or help people have the best experience possible. When we arrived the host cheerily conveyed that the buffet wouldn't be ready for a bit because they just opened, as though one shouldn't expect a restaurant to be ready for service when it opens for service. (It was 11 AM not 8 AM). The phrasing and tone indicated this is the norm rather than an exception. If you are going specifically for the buffet, don't expect it to be ready when the doors open. Unfortunately, I had been specifically looking forward to the buffet and was disappointed by the menu, which was far more limited, more typical in its offerings and out of the one or two less common things.As my dish was handed to me I was informed that they didn't have one of the key ingredients, and was asked if I would like to make a substitution for that ingredient. It was an odd thing to inform someone of while presenting their meal, rather than sharing it as soon as possible so that the customer could potentially order something else.The space felt nice. I will probably give them another try at some point."

The last time I came I also ordered some desserts. The Sweet Potato brownie was pretty good but the texture is a little stretchy rather than breakable like a regular brownie. I thought there could have been more chocolate flavor too. I loved the Chocolate Chip Cookie here though. I think there's some coconut flavor somewhere in there which I loved.

His music was wonderful and his voice was lovely. The next was a band that I believe was five or six guys and they were all very towns and it was much more upbeat sort of danceable music. Our server was fantastic and exceptionally knowledgeable. They had a huge whiskey menu but also other cocktails and beer is for those who don't like whiskey.There is a cover charge in cash of $20 but it was completely worth it. We also made a reservation ahead of time for table to make sure we had a good spot for viewing the stage and listening to music.

I came here around 9pm on a Wednesday night and it wasn't too packed. $10 cover, which I thought was reasonable. They have an extensive alcohol menu (whiskey, wine, some beers, etc.) but no food! They sell peanuts/almonds though, which we were not interested in... the prices were just OK, and actually quite pricey for this area (e.g. $8 beers, $9-15 wines by the glass.)I didn't really like the first solo performer too much, but the band who performed second was pretty good! The only issue I had with this place was... between the first performer and the band that came up, there was about a 45 minute delay... I think they were setting up?! This was pretty frustrating because we weren't planning to stay all night. Overall, great value for a jazz bar but the performances are hit or miss. Not sure how busy it gets on weekends, but I would recommend coming here closer to 10-1030pm on weeknights. 3.5 stars."

NO SALAD. my husband got chicken with mushrooms and they only gave a small piece of chicken.  They charge $20-30 a plate and only give ONE piece ? Smh. And their new cook has no flavor.

I've also gotten their rice and bean platters and chicken soup. Their soup came with a container of rice with steak and a salad. Perfect meals every time!"

Came to eat dinner on a Tuesday night with my parents and my wife at 7pm. Place was empty and they close at 9. Asked if we could sit at a table for 6 since the table for 4 they showed us was a tight squeeze and they said no. Ok fine. We were hungry. Ordered the fried calamari appetizer which was meh. We all ordered our meals which came before they could clear the appetizer plate off the table. Dinner could barely fit on this small table they put us to sit at. They came later to ask how we were doing and I said ok but it's really tight here. They laughed. Later we mentioned we could have sat at the table for 6 since the place was empty. They laughed and said maybe next time. Really? The bill came and they already added the tip to the bill. Safe to say there definitely won't be a next time. Wonder if it's because we were Indian in a Colombian restaurant. Pathetic!

My friend and I decided on:-Plantain chips with garlic sauce-Fried ribs with rice, beans and plantains-The bandeja plate with steak, pork, rice, beans, fried egg and the corn cake -Passion Fruit juice (I asked for a little extra sugar because it was pretty tart)The service was good and the prices were reasonable. I would definitely go back again!"

I was very surprised tonight though to find that the sausage onions and peppers pizza has NO tomato sauce! The pizza is good, but for me it needs to be really clear in the description that this pizza doesn't have sauce! If I ordered sausages peppers and onions on a pie anywhere else, sauce would be a given. Interesting choice PP. Thanks for the speedy service."

2449,V05D4jAQb3rT3WqEBGq-og,4/26/2018,4 star rating,"Prospect Pizza definitely is hitting a sweet spot for the area. This part of Brooklyn doesn't have dollar slices, and it does have some fantastic sit-down places popping up (looking at you Zurilee, Parkside, etc.), but it most certainly lacks something in the middle (and no, don't even get me started on Gino's).Prospect Pizza is the place you want to order from, or walk over to, to grab a pie last minute just because you feel like it. The prices seem pretty even keel for the most part, and the grandma pie I ordered was pretty good. It was pretty thin for a slice of that style, which wasn't bad, but definitely thinner than most of the usual ones I've had. Seasoning was good, cheese and sauce were solid A-. Good enough that I'll definitely be coming back to try some more options. Their daily specials are a nice way to mix things up, and while I haven't tried their other Italian dishes yet, I'm willing to take a chance.They had our pizza ready in about 30 minutes for a take-out order, as promised. Nice to see a new place that isn't trying too hard, but is just doing their own thing."

But I know a good slice when I see one and the Sicilian thin crust at Prospect Pizza is damn good. Crispy crust gooey cheese, slightly sweet tomato sauce it was really good. I usually opt for a grandma slice but this was as close as I could get on this particular day. The slice was $3 so about par for the course. They have a pretty extensive menu and since they are new they have frequent specials. If Im ever in the pizza mood again and looking to stay in PLG/Flatbush Im coming back here."

The pizza did not even resemble Italian food. Yes, there was crust, some kind of cheese, minimal, bland sauce, and some random, also bland, oily vegetables on it, but it really tasted like ""pizza"" you'd get in a strip mall in the Midwest somewhere. As a Brooklyn pizzeria, they should be ashamed of themselves :(. Nice delivery guy, though."

Mominette offers an extensive weekend brunch, but also has a daily lunch menu with plenty of egg options to satisfy your weekday brunch cravings. The interior is charming shabby chic, with a beautiful well stocked bar. They do not have an espresso machine, but their Cold Brew was really good. The Bloody Mary was strong, but lacking in flavor. There were also whole peppercorns in it, which made for a few very unpleasant sips. I would try another drink next time-their cocktail list looks awesome. The Eggs Florentine was fantastic aside from the overcooked egg, which was closer to hard boiled than poached. The English muffin was fresh and fluffy, topped with flavorful sautéed spinach and a delicious hollandaise. If the egg was cooked properly, this dish would be a 10/10. Overall, a great neighborhood spot."

2462,hh2T5aLJsSjpHvPRcQxIJw,8/4/2022,2 star rating,"A little late on my review but... my husband and I went to Mominette to celebrate Bastille day. Weather was nice so we opted for an outside option. Once our food started arriving , our appetizer was placed/taken to the wrong table 3x. Given all the infectious diseases going around, I definitely did not like my food being placed on someone else's table. The guy on the table next to us made a comment to the server about needing to get their tables correct as he had also gotten the wrong food.  Our main dish was sent only o the incorrect table once, then he took it back in side and then came to us. As we were eating, a rat started roaming the tables around the empty area. I understand there is a pretty bad rat situation everywhere so we were like ""okay, as long as it stays on the other side, away from us we are cool."" The server (different than previous ones) saw me seeing the rat and tried to get it to go away discretely. Did not say anything to anyone still eating. A few minutes later the rat came back out and got close to several tables with people. At that point, we asked for our check and went inside to pay as the rat was way too close to comfort. Once inside, we waited for our check, the bartender asked what we needed and we expressed waiting for the check inside as there was a rat outside. Her response was to continue to talk about rats with us explaining that they had taken down the shed in the front as it had a rat infestation and that they were going to start work in the backyard. She then continued to talk about how she was walking on the street and multiple rats went over her feet. It was a terrible dining experience and at no point did anyone in the staff apologize for the rat situation in their backyard. Not even an acknowledgement from the server that he had seen the rat too. Then to be told that they knew about the rat problem and didn't close the backyard!? And cherry on top, let's talk about rats for 10 mins? It was all way too much. In regards to the food, the drinks were truly amazing, app was decent, mussels' sauce was very sweet not particularly my taste, the duck was very good. Did not get to dessert per above.  For how expensive it was it truly frustrated me the lack of acknowledgement, idk give us a free drink for our troubles? Take off something of the bill? Apologize? Idk? Something?It's annoying because we used to love this place. We even celebrated our anniversary there 2 years ago! Ugh. Do better please."
2463,hh2T5aLJsSjpHvPRcQxIJw,1/25/2023,2 star rating,"This restaurant is VASTLY overpriced for the quality of the food.I had dinner for the first time at Mominette last night with my family. The menu sounded appealing, but we found that the execution of the dishes was poor. For example, we shared an arugula salad with beets and cheese that was overpowered by a piquant dressing slathered on top. The same salad vegetables dressed properly would have been good but the application of the dressing was inexcusable. What were they thinking? French onion soup was poor -- it actually doesn't require a lot of skill to make a decent onion soup so it is hard to understand how the kitchen could turn out such an unappetizing version. A vegetarian pesto pasta dish was oily and poorly seasoned. Mominette either needs to lower its prices or increase the preparation quality."

Provide hot sauce for those who wish to have their food more spicy but its ridiculous to make your food so hot for the public. Im Jamaican who knows about spice but this makes no sense.

BIG MISTAKE. There's a warning sign for hot soup that reaches 100°C Fried wontons -- lackluster. There was little to no filling. Freshly fried. 8/10Smoked Pepper Beef Slices Rice Noodle -- we ordered it DIY style where they separated all the ingredients for us to construct when the soup came. I loved this soup base. It's just the right about of spice with a little bit of sourness. 10/10Original Beef Brisket Rice Noodle -- soup base was rich in bone broth BUT it could use a little bit of spice. As expected, the original is without any spice. Brisket was a bit chewy, but large portions. 9/10"

I don't recommend sitting outside since you're right smack in the side of the sidewalk where there's too much foot traffic. Way too close for comfort at times. Tried one of their cocktails: Brazilian cosmo : and it tasted a bit too strong on the fruity vodka side (maybe it was just my taste) but I did not get a second one. I got the burger and they definitely undercooked it even though I requested medium, but the service ended up being better and our waitress was friendly. Maybe I'd come back to try their wine selection since they are a wine bar."

There are a lot of fish / seafood items including four tartares. We got the meatballs (good), duck pate (good), steak tartare (great), and octopus salad (phenomenal). Chocolate mousse cake for desert was also yummy. Service was also good. The inside has more of a sports bar look to it, but the menu is surprisingly elevated. It's also incredibly reasonably priced and very large portions for what you get. The Brazilian cosmo was also very good. Would definitely come back."

All tables were filled, not 6 feet apart and there was a group of 8 sitting behind me. They did have happy hour specials on select wine for $8. Food was below average; we ordered the Brussel sprouts, crispy artichokes and the Parma panini to share. Portions were so small for the price. Brussels $12 were bland and barely cooked. Crispy artichokes $10 were good, but isn't everything fried delicious? Parma panini $15 was a lot of bread and arugula with little meat/cheese. $50 meal including tip for each of us with 2 glasses of wine and I left feeling still hungry. Skip this place!"

There's a Dunkin Donuts around the corner on Newkirk Plaza, but I don't understand why anyone would go there, since besides DD coffee being pretty gross, there's Kabir's. It's a straightforward cup of coffee, hot or iced, but it's done well, so it tastes good. I haven't tried the samosas yet, since that's not, for me, a nice match with coffee, but that clearly seems like the way to go. When you see burly white trucker who's delivering Pepsi next door stop in for a samosa, you suspect they must be awesome."

Pregnancy cravings were hitting hard and the hubby found this spot near our gym and suggested we give it a shot! Lychee, honeydew, and mint ($7): Love!! Not too sweet and very refreshing.Miso Soup ($7): a bit too heavy on the sesame oil for my taste, but otherwise pretty standard miso soup. Fried Chick'n Bao ($16): The ""chicken"" was shaped like chicken nuggets and has the texture of a medium/hard tofu. I wouldn't say it taste (texture-wise) of chicken, but it's a yummy fried meat-alt nonetheless. Would love to have it doused more in the sauce! Now onto the fun stuff...sushi! We got Rainbow Roll ($16), Zalmon ($10 x 3 sushi pieces), Nori Taco Sampler ($15). The texture of the ""fish"" was SO spot on. The Zalmon sushi pieces are a bit thin for the amount of rice it's placed on, but it honestly tastes like the real deal. My favorite was the taco sampler which you pretty much get an entire mouthful of just ""fish"" - so this def knocked my cravings out the ballpark. I asked one of the waiters what the ""fish"" is made from, and they said tapioca! Black Sesame Avocado Cookie ($12): of course, we couldn't leave without trying their dessert. Best way to end the meal - the cookie was more like a soft cake cooked in a mini castiron topped off with a small scoop of ice cream. Again, not too sweet (just how I like it) and I had to fight my hubby for the last bite."

The vegan fish was not your typical vegetable substitute--it featured the impossible fish that were nearly impossible to tell apart from actual fish.PRICE: Considering the ambiance, food presentation, and taste/quality, the price was quite reasonable.VIBE: Cute date spot, and enjoyed the decor.

I'm not vegan, but I am a HUGE sushi fan and thought they did a great job at substituting the texture and flavor of fish without it being off putting. However, I came here with my two friends who are vegan and they didn't love it. They said it tasted too similar to real fish, so they couldn't get themselves to really like it. As a non-vegan, I didn't agree but I could see how they could feel that way and not enjoy it. The service was okay, nothing great but nothing bad. The vibe is pretty casual and good for dinner with friends or something along those lines"

The mushrooms were meaty and flavorful. Avocado was a great accompaniment for this salad. Unfortunately I don't rave the same about their Vegan sushi. I had the charred avocado roll with "" caviar"" on top. The dish was extra fishy. It made me nauseous. I tried dunking it in some soy sauce to see if that would mask the taste but I was unsuccessful. I couldn't eat it to be honest."

My favorites are the Mighty Mushroom and Spicy Mang, as they are the signature rolls and they have just the right amount of burst of flavor. Also really like the black rice concept. but also really loved the Ube Crunch which I tried recently. The Miso soup is a little bit bland, but I overall liked it on a cold day. Wish the Shitake Truffle dumplings were pan fried, but still really good taste regardless. Will likely keep returning here in the future, as I love the overall vibes and atmosphere."

Both times there was an oddly mingled crowd, with some quirky bar staff. Totally dig it!! On my afternoon adventure, we got some apps. The Brussels sprouts are quintessentially buttered with a lively kick from the peppers. If you get the fries, 100% get the aioli! I enjoyed the garlic aioli on my Brussels sprouts too. The deviled eggs were def my favorite out of the 3 samples we tried, whipped to perfect consistency.At 7pm certain wines were half off! We started too early to partake, but I'll definitely be back. When I came on a late night adventure, it was just my party and One other on the patio. Was very chill for 2am on a weekend in Brooklyn, and I was ok with that! Felt like a hidden gem I probably shouldn't be boasting about..... The set up is cute, horseshoe bar with a great deal of booths inside. Outside  is a patio decorated with a plethora of greenery,  courted with dainty awnings over each table.An ideal date night spot, a nook to quietly read a book with a stiff bev, or maybe a convenient place for intimate conversation.... Could totally be a rager too, the place is your pallet!"

I have tried other burgers in the area but the Rookery burger is my go-to. The customer service is always super friendly (and fast too). If you're on the fence--just do it, you won't regret it. Everything is fresh and the fries are a dream."

Not the bartenders fault, but they def seemed to be understaffed the day I was there. They only had the two bartenders making drinks, taking food orders, acting as waiters, bussing tables during a busy Monday happy hour. They were out of the froze so my friend and I got palomas that were just not good at all. There was also a price discrepancy because I asked for a well drink for HH, and he rung it up as a cocktail even though I asked him to make me literally any tequila well...???? Stuff like that really really annoys me. The saving grace was the mussels and since it was Monday, you can get a small serving for 5 dollars. The space is also really nice. I think I'll give them another chance because the ambiance and food was good but hopefully they can get the service together."

Their outdoor patio is a nice vibe and indoors is majestic. I especially love the tall ceilings, which reminds you more of a wedding venue than a bar/restaurant.  The drinks were good and reasonably priced and their wings and truffle fries was a nice addition to the drinks. It's not grunge like a typical Bushwick bar. Can't wait to return. The staff is super nice and professional, as well."

It has dive bar mixed with chic mixed with goth vibes but it's one of the most peaceful places you can come to drink/eat. It's so spacious you'll feel it's just you and your friends. You'll vibe to a funky song on the speakers and still be able to have a conversation with your friends. Every single bartender is amazing! They listen and take care of you with excellent customer service. The drinks are very well made! Even their house vodka and tequila are enjoyable as shots!The food is amazing! You wouldn't think it was bar food. The burgers, fries, salad, wings are on the top of my list! Come and enjoy some food, drinks, and funky music as a night out or simply for lunch."

How does your whole staff have terrible customer service. Someone clearly tells you they have an allergy to mayo based product and you get an attitude after making food with It. Then when asked to speak to a manager the young Latino kid lies and points to a coin and walks away. Like wow way to back up your team. The so called manager couldn't even speak English. I don't know what Taco Bell is doing but something has to change. At least insure your customers are properly trained.If you don't want to work then don't work. The food even sucked the whole experience was terrible. Never will be coming to this establishment again.

They have lots of sweet and savory desserts to choose from. They also sell breads, cakes and drinks to go. I've tried the bread with corn which I wished had more corn flavor. It was cool though there were corn kernels in the bread.I also decided to by these cute red bean happy bear buns. The bread was airy and filled with a sweet smooth red bean paste.The prices here are a bit in the high side compared to some other bakeries in the area, so I only pick something up once in a while."

Spoiler alert for anyone who didn't know, this place is owned by a Korean company (not French). This is fine, but I noticed some people didn't realize this. The tiramisu was decent and I would probably get this again. The strawberry cake was too sweet and had too much cream. The macarons were standard. The sweets do look really cute. The milk tea was bland and tasted a bit watered down. A young boy was asked to show his receipt before he could use the bathroom even though he just recently ordered. So, save your receipts just in case."

I got a margarita slice - I would rate this a 6.2. Not the worst, but also not the best. There was A LOT of oregano on this slice. The crust was very crunchy. A specialty slice was $4.00.

When you first go in you see the cute little decor on the left wall, the menu on the right wall, and the food prep crew / kitchen straight ahead. There was little seating space right beyond the cute decor. There was a built in bench and about 5 stools. If you keep going straight to the back there was more seating available. A couple of tables and chairs in booths in the inside / outside area. You will feel the outside weather in this seating area. I ordered and waited about 10 minutes for my food. I took it to go. When I got home I opened the container and HOLYYYY MOLYYYYY the amazing smells rolled out the container. The lamb meat was so tender and juicy. It was seasoned perfectly!!! The noodles was fresh as well but was not as full of flavor like the other places. The only thing differently about this dish I wish this restaurant offered was a soup option like the Very Fresh Noodles restaurant does with this same dish."

Ordering is simply and as you wait, you're welcome to stand/sit by the window or other tables. Wait is around 5 minutes and when dining in, they'll call your order and place the tray on a counter. You grab your own utensils and voila. My favorite dishes are the cumin lamb and oxtail hand pulled noodles. The noodles are thick, long, and the perfect amount of chewy. Meats are tender and seasoned well. I opt for the spiciest option. Portion sizes are also great!"

The spice is numbing with schichuan peppers and cumin spice that gives it's this tingly sensation. Noodles are always on point where it's chewy and thick. Another one of my favorite is their porky burgers. The price is reasonable for downtown prices and the tax is included into the price."

I went to find seating while my partner ordered at the front, and it was easy to find us seats, with the outdoor seating in the back open. It's a separate structure that has tables and counter seating and heaters to prevent it from getting too cold. When I went in, it was pretty quiet, with three other people sitting there silently slurping their noodles. When we got our noodles, I understood the intense focus, because of how fresh and delicious they were. I got the N4 with the Hawberry Juice on the side. It didn't look like too much but it was super filling and I wasn't actually able to finish my whole plate.I went in with no expectations, but I would definitely come back to try out more of the menu, and maybe try out a spicier option."

The wait to receive our food was long. The bathrooms needed cleaning and more hand soap. The one server for most of our lunchtime service was hustling as best as he could but the two support staff were slow, like real slow. Although it was late lunchtime the stream of customers would not stop. They kept coming and coming and coming. That's because the food is delicious. We ordered the red lentil soup which we enjoyed. The chicken kabob platter was tasty. We carried home the chopped lamb kabob which was seasoned and flavorful.The one terrific server was warm and kind and seemed to be interested in our experience. We will return and hopefully staffing levels will be appropriate."

The service was super slow (despite not being overly busy) but the food makes up for it. We started off with warm, complementary bread with a white and green dip. Both were delicious! About 15 minutes later, our Shirazi Salad came out. 25 minutes later, our orders finally came out. We waited overall about 45 minutes from the time we order until we ate. But this is the good part - the Chicken Sultani and Lamb Koobideh were unbelievably juicy, buttery, and well-seasoned. The aromatic basmati rice with saffron paired well with the meats. The Barg Kabob was juicy, tender, and had a citrusy element to it which I thought was unique. The Zereshk Rice is airy and bursting with flavor too! You really can't go wrong with any of these 3 options. I highly recommend getting different plates like we did so you can try more! Delicious food, great portions, and overall very satisfied!"

If you are looking to try a new cuisine, I highly recommend going to Ravagh. We started with their Kashk-Bademjan, which is cooked eggplant simmered in tomato sauce and topped with yogurt. Their bread is so light and perfect to start the meal. Also, they have a great cocktail list with very unique drinks and a solid wine list too. For our entree, we  got the Lamb Koobideh (chopped lamb) kebabs and the Khoresh Bademjan stew. Both were absolutely to die for!! The kebabs were the best kebabs/lamb dish I have ever had, the meat was cooked and spiced perfectly. The stew was such an interesting combination of flavors and was unlike anything I've had before. On the side, we had the Shirazi cucumber salad, which was refreshing and paired well with the rest of our dinner. I can't wait to come back here and try more of the menu options, it was seriously one of the best meals I've had in a while."

I can say with confidence this is one of, if not the best I've had. The gheymeh stew was very high quality, and you can taste the shirazi ingredients were recently cut fresh, unlike some other restaurants. If you want the shirazi, I recommend you ask for half/half for your rice. The joojeh kabob had the perfect taste from the cooking to the spices. The staff I saw were Persian too which is always a good sign. I can recommend this place to anyone, whether they're trying this cuisine for the first time, or just exploring new places. Also note the joojeh kabob comes bone-in by default, which is rare so it's easy to miss."
2660,h7zUbQHTcCDHGY1jdyT8hg,12/10/2022,4 star rating,Came here on two separate occasions. The first time was fine but the second time it was clear they messed up two dishes for protein (it seems like they add the protein to the khoresh after the fact) and switched the protein of them. It would've been fine if the fesanjan hadn't been so sweet--if you get it highly recommend splitting it rather than a meal--but that is a regional difference in what I'm familiar with for this dish. The lamb shank was amazing and the kabobs are pretty good. Honestly mostly taking the star off for the mix up and the service as it was really hard to get water refills and flag down the staff to pay.

But the food we got was very delicious. We didn't even go extravagant- just rice and beans, plantains, and fried chicken. But if they can get the simplest of dishes right, I can't imagine how good the rest of their food is! I'm looking forward to my next visit to this area. I will go out of my way to visit this place."

CHICKEN SOUP is Grrrrreat w/ just enough spices. #3. Pernil is pretty good. You might just walk by this place and not notice it since its kind of hidden.

HOWEVER, now that area has had GENTRIFICATION recent years the customer service here is HORRIBLE. I personally experienced the staff catering + prioritizing the ""new"" residents in area before everyone else. I personally stood and waited to place and order this am when another gentlemen of Caucasian decent came a few minutes after. The young woman took my order then his (very similar) However, not only did they make his food first and completely disregarded my order but the cashier had to actually reiterate my order to cook because they were so focused on getting this mans order done and him out at ease and rather had me wait although I ordered and entered establishment first. When I addressed the manager he made a very condescending gesture and told me No they don't do that although it was extremely evident. NYC Human Rights commission needs to crack down on these businesses that are serving gentrification areas. It isn't nice or fare how the original neighborhood residents are being treated."

Not much to say, cheap coffee to go, quick stop for some caffeine and from reading some other reviews, I might need to stop by for some food as well. The only spot open for coffee if you're going to photograph a sunrise in the morning, by the way."
2666,XpgquUrYWa-URbgi-3pykg,10/19/2015,5 star rating,Amazing service and the food is even better. On the outside it may look like your regular deli but they prepare special meals every day. You can really tell that care and love is put into this business as it is family owned and they make you feel welcomed. I'm sad that I don't work in this area anymore so I won't get my daily lunch but I will stop by whenever I get a chance. Just that good.

I would say that I enjoyed my seafood soup.  It was full of crab legs, big pieces of fish, rice cooked down to a porridge, red peppers, potatoes, shrimps.  What was more awesome about it was that it was chock full of flavor. My only wish was that it had more mussels (minus one star). This place seems a bit dark, yet thoroughly air conditioned unlike its popular neighborhood competition.  My hubby ordered the codfish and a side of vegetables.  Veggies consisted of broccoli and carrot.  Both of the meals were heavenly.  I want to come back to try the meat platters.  I saw some delicious pork and succulent beef and flavorful chicken.  The portion size here is large.  Come armed with an appetite.  There are a variety of beverages even traditional ones like Mamey, Morir Sonando(not sure how to make the tilde on the n here on Yelp!), and others that sound like batidos(milkshakes). They sound delicious!"

It's a cute little spot with a cozy atmosphere.  Unfortunately, the food is really bland. My daughter had the spaghetti squash with fingerling potatoes, the plating was fine; however lacking in flavor. I chose the mushroom Risotto with a filet. The Risotto was very bland almost tasted watered down, the filet never arrived. The owner took $5 off the total to compensate for the missing filet, $29 for tasteless Risotto just didn't feel right. I did notice quite a few people left almost all their food on the plate and none took the leftovers. My daughter and I did the same,  no sense in upsetting our dogs stomach."

2694,dfuedxl8OncQJuF_SWNKig,10/3/2021,5 star rating,"I've been coming here for years and have loved the food every single time. Rolly Kimbab is my go-to spot when I want something delicious, healthy, and moderately priced. They are great for food on the go, as well as to feed large groups of people. I consistently choose Rolly over other restaurants serving kimbab because of their simple, homemade quality that translates through their fresh ingredients and the love you feel while eating it. Their kimbab rolls are great on their own because they are packed with fresh cooked meats and colorful veggies. Great to bring on trips or picnics for a meal, and just order as many as you want! We've placed large orders for parties as well, and they can arrange them on a catering tray for you. Their cupbabs are a fun mix of rice, egg, kimchi, and your choice of meat. Another travel size meal-in-one!When we prefer a more traditional sit down meal, we also like ordering the Couples Set, which gives you a sampler of meat, tofu, kimchi, salad, etc. I'm grateful for this humble establishment providing such consistent and nutritious food, and will continue to give them my business!!"

We got the dukboki with chewy noodles, which are essentially the japchae noodles. If you can't handle spice like my husband, this might be a little too spicy for you but it was sooo delicious. We also go two kimbap, which is their signature. It was nice and soft and super yummy too. All in all, highly recommend!"

They are consistently good. I always get the couple set- the pork cutlet is good even though sometimes dry. The dubboki was definitely a little spicier than the last one I had from the Bayside location! So it varies. Had to chug some water with that!"

It's served in a big stone and the rice on the bottom gets super crispy. You get to mix in all the ingredients and add the yummy sauces. It is both fun to eat and delicious, which is my favorite kind of food. The staff are extremely accommodating we even came with a large group for lunch and they were able to seat all of us with no issues. Rolly will always be a staple for me, dine in or take out."

The dough had a little bit of sweetness to it and the filling was cooked very well. The samosas came with two sauces which one was minty and the other was tamarind. Quite flavorful and added to the deliciousness of the samosas. The Palak Paneer was outstanding. It comes with steamed rice which was well cooked. The Panner was a little spicy (they ask if you want it mild, medium, or spicy) but could have been a bit spicier for my tastes. I really enjoyed the flavors of the dish. It was amazingly rich.The service was great, very attentive, but not overbearing. I liked it so much I debated coming back again the next day but I wanted to try a different place while I was in town. I'll be back if given the chance."

We started off with a plethora of apps: Samosas, Kai Chi, Steamed Chicken dumplings, Papaya Salad, and Garlic Naan. Everything was delicious except for the Papaya Salad. The ginger was overwhelming and I couldn't wrap my head around why anyone would want to order it. We decided to split our entrees family style. We ordered the Chili Shrimp, Chicken Pad Thai, Pineapple Fried Rice, and the Chicken Tikka Masala. Everything was phenomenal and filled us up rather quickly. Halfway through my meal I had the itis. The reason Nanking didn't receive five stars is because the service was slow. The busboys reached over me and my plate to remove items from the table without excusing themselves. Also they kept running into my purse that was hanging on the back of my chair without apologizing."

Staff busy by hanging out in the corner chatting so they don't really have time for customers. I order seafood chowder with rice and beans . Chowder was good but rice was missing beans it was some but mostly just liquid from it with dry piece of meat. I asked for check and waited at least 15 min while server was hanging out by bar. Prices on menu is different than they charge without letting you know and it's not negotiable. Perhaps there's better and more honest places around.
3,a-hVnSTC12MY5L3t9yOSJw,11/15/2021,5 star rating,Stopped by this busy restaurant yesterday for lunch. The food and service was amazing. The food I ate here gave me a home cooked feeling. I left with my belly full and a smile on my face. I would definitely recommend this restaurant very affordable and big portions. I can't wait to go and try some of  other dishes they have.
4,a-hVnSTC12MY5L3t9yOSJw,5/31/2022,4 star rating,"Kind of love this place. Sometimes when I get out from work, I travel out here from Manhattan just for dinner (plus another little gem down the block). Aside from my iconic hair style (lol), a few of the staff members also remember me because I order the same dish almost every single time. My go to is the Bistec (Steak) with cheese arepa, sometimes with rice and beans and/or avocado. I've also had their Churrasco and Entraña. The last two dishes are quite pricey if you're on a budget. I order these when I really want to sink my teeth into a nice piece of steak. It should be noted that these two dishes are huge and may be too much for some. The arepa is the real reason I keep coming back. One or both of the last steak dishes brings small arepas (can't remember which). I think these arepas are a disappointment. They're really small and doughy. They have no actual taste. The cheese arepa is the way to go. It's a tad salty but I absolutely love it. I've literally traveled out here just to order a few to take home. The steak in the first dish I mentioned is a tad slim, a little bit thicker than a piece of paper. It too is quite delicious despite the underwhelming thickness. If I'm really hungry, I end up ordering a second plate of the exact same dish. Food aside, the service is great. I never waited too long for food unless they're packed (usually weekends). There's so much staff here that you're taken care of almost immediately. I'm not so fond of their decoration however. They have a white and red theme going on. It's nothing off putting but you notice it. On the first floor (this place has an upper level), there's a giant tree that's randomly place in the middle of the dining area. Again, you note it. It's quite random. It's like they want us to feel like we're outside inside. I don't think that worked really well. I definitely need to order the other plates to (chicken, fish, etc.) to have a better opinion on their entire menu. At least I'm fond of the steaks."

7,a-hVnSTC12MY5L3t9yOSJw,11/12/2021,1 star rating,"This was a couple days ago not today but I'm gonna review it today. This restaurant is a popular Spanish food chain restaurant known in queens. I've gone to multiple of the same brand name, different place but same menu and food dishes for each restaurant. For a while since years back so I would know when things are changed being a customer time after time with my mother even showing me this restaurant. In person this restaurant is good, the food is fresh and meets my standards of what a Spanish restaurant should be like. Friendly staff no long wait for the food at all. For delivery I cannot say the same. Iv ordered many times because my mother likes a certain dish called Plato aguacatala it's a big dish that comes with steak rice and beans and salad. Along with a lettuce leaf and guacamole on top. We've ordered many different dishes from time to time but this one is a favorite. I put well done on the delivery note on Uber and the meat came completely raw, you can tell they cooked it so fast it looked cooked exterior but inside completely raw and with no thought at all to the note I put saying WELL DONE. Instead they send raw meat to a paying customer! So I had to recook the steak. The meat had a lot of excess fat as well and looked so unappealing. Since we are old customers we know how the dish is supposed to look! The meat was smaller portion not because it was burnt they changed the dish completely. Not only that the guacamole they sent  came  in a smaller tiny container. Not like past numerous times they changed the dish to make it smaller but still same price! It's suppose to come in a plastic box container with lettuce leaf under guacamole. No lettuce under or how they use to sell prior, instead in a tiny sauce container half the size. I called to make sure there was no mistake the lady on the phone said that's how it's always been but is wrong, she must be new or doesn't know the menu herself, she claimed that I ordered probably the smaller size which is wrong again. It's not her fault it's the chef who prepared it this time. There's only one size for this dish and iv ordered it about 100 times in other occasions. I would know if I'm the paying customer ordering what I thought would be the same dish if not I wouldn't have ordered it. This was around noon when I ordered so who knows if things were rushed. Still very disappointed this isn't the first time the meats been sent not well done so I'm reviewing today. For delivery I wouldn't advise this place at all, it's a hit or miss and most of the time a big miss! In person I can say it's been good but I can be confusing with other locations for in person only. Nonetheless it made me grow disgust for meat again to the point where I thought of becoming vegan again! Paying for food you have to throw away is how you lose customers. Will not be reordering."

The waiter was fast, friendly and attentive and was very familiar with the menu. I was in the mood for my usual ( seafood ) but then I quickly changed my mind, so I ordered the next best thing (steak) and potatoes. I started with the sangria which was deeelishous!! I'm not a fan of sangria but that restaurant is known for it so I had to try, after the first cup I wanted a pitcher. It was So good!!!!! . Their also known for there pollo (hence the name) so my husband ordered a whole chicken with rice and beans. The pollo was juicy and seasoned amd cooked well, however I wasn't a fan of the beans. As for my skirt steak, i ordered it medium well and it came hot and juicy, nice and Charred and made perfect. I absolutely enjoyed my steak and the red potatoes. The only thing I wish is that I had more. I also wish i had room for dessert would've love to try their dessert but I was stuffed and ready for bed.

37,dNFsMw-z3Vsa5TbJd9Q4Ew,11/12/2021,1 star rating,"This was a couple days ago not today but I'm gonna review it today. This restaurant is a popular Spanish food chain restaurant known in queens. I've gone to multiple of the same brand name, different place but same menu and food dishes for each restaurant. For a while since years back so I would know when things are changed being a customer time after time with my mother even showing me this restaurant. In person this restaurant is good, the food is fresh and meets my standards of what a Spanish restaurant should be like. Friendly staff no long wait for the food at all. For delivery I cannot say the same. Iv ordered many times because my mother likes a certain dish called Plato aguacatala it's a big dish that comes with steak rice and beans and salad. Along with a lettuce leaf and guacamole on top. We've ordered many different dishes from time to time but this one is a favorite. I put well done on the delivery note on Uber and the meat came completely raw, you can tell they cooked it so fast it looked cooked exterior but inside completely raw and with no thought at all to the note I put saying WELL DONE. Instead they send raw meat to a paying customer! So I had to recook the steak. The meat had a lot of excess fat as well and looked so unappealing. Since we are old customers we know how the dish is supposed to look! The meat was smaller portion not because it was burnt they changed the dish completely. Not only that the guacamole they sent  came  in a smaller tiny container. Not like past numerous times they changed the dish to make it smaller but still same price! It's suppose to come in a plastic box container with lettuce leaf under guacamole. No lettuce under or how they use to sell prior, instead in a tiny sauce container half the size. I called to make sure there was no mistake the lady on the phone said that's how it's always been but is wrong, she must be new or doesn't know the menu herself, she claimed that I ordered probably the smaller size which is wrong again. It's not her fault it's the chef who prepared it this time. There's only one size for this dish and iv ordered it about 100 times in other occasions. I would know if I'm the paying customer ordering what I thought would be the same dish if not I wouldn't have ordered it. This was around noon when I ordered so who knows if things were rushed. Still very disappointed this isn't the first time the meats been sent not well done so I'm reviewing today. For delivery I wouldn't advise this place at all, it's a hit or miss and most of the time a big miss! In person I can say it's been good but I can be confusing with other locations for in person only. Nonetheless it made me grow disgust for meat again to the point where I thought of becoming vegan again! Paying for food you have to throw away is how you lose customers. Will not be reordering."

The restaurant is open late so after a nite out this would be a perfect go to spot! Beware of the line, might be a long wait for a seat but the place is big and spacious with an up and downstairs seating area, we waited like 10mins for a seat but it was worth it. The waiter was fast, friendly and attentive and was very familiar with the menu. I was in the mood for my usual ( seafood ) but then I quickly changed my mind, so I ordered the next best thing (steak) and potatoes. I started with the sangria which was deeelishous!! I'm not a fan of sangria but that restaurant is known for it so I had to try, after the first cup I wanted a pitcher. It was So good!!!!! . Their also known for there pollo (hence the name) so my husband ordered a whole chicken with rice and beans. The pollo was juicy and seasoned amd cooked well, however I wasn't a fan of the beans. As for my skirt steak, i ordered it medium well and it came hot and juicy, nice and Charred and made perfect. I absolutely enjoyed my steak and the red potatoes. The only thing I wish is that I had more. I also wish i had room for dessert would've love to try their dessert but I was stuffed and ready for bed. Would definitely return with friends or family very soon"

The food came out really quickly and when it did it was hot and delicious even late on a Sunday night. Beware of the birthday celebration noise though! Almost choked on my food it startled me so bad.

42,M2AfRLalBLSoj8WBxCtbZw,7/29/2022,2 star rating,Colombian restaurant on Roosevelt Ave. Place has two  floors  and a lot of staff. Staff busy by hanging out in the corner chatting so they don't really have time for customers. I order seafood chowder with rice and beans . Chowder was good but rice was missing beans it was some but mostly just liquid from it with dry piece of meat. I asked for check and waited at least 15 min while server was hanging out by bar. Prices on menu is different than they charge without letting you know and it's not negotiable. Perhaps there's better and more honest places around.
43,M2AfRLalBLSoj8WBxCtbZw,11/15/2021,5 star rating,Stopped by this busy restaurant yesterday for lunch. The food and service was amazing. The food I ate here gave me a home cooked feeling. I left with my belly full and a smile on my face. I would definitely recommend this restaurant very affordable and big portions. I can't wait to go and try some of  other dishes they have.
44,M2AfRLalBLSoj8WBxCtbZw,5/31/2022,4 star rating,"Kind of love this place. Sometimes when I get out from work, I travel out here from Manhattan just for dinner (plus another little gem down the block). Aside from my iconic hair style (lol), a few of the staff members also remember me because I order the same dish almost every single time. My go to is the Bistec (Steak) with cheese arepa, sometimes with rice and beans and/or avocado. I've also had their Churrasco and Entraña. The last two dishes are quite pricey if you're on a budget. I order these when I really want to sink my teeth into a nice piece of steak. It should be noted that these two dishes are huge and may be too much for some. The arepa is the real reason I keep coming back. One or both of the last steak dishes brings small arepas (can't remember which). I think these arepas are a disappointment. They're really small and doughy. They have no actual taste. The cheese arepa is the way to go. It's a tad salty but I absolutely love it. I've literally traveled out here just to order a few to take home. The steak in the first dish I mentioned is a tad slim, a little bit thicker than a piece of paper. It too is quite delicious despite the underwhelming thickness. If I'm really hungry, I end up ordering a second plate of the exact same dish. Food aside, the service is great. I never waited too long for food unless they're packed (usually weekends). There's so much staff here that you're taken care of almost immediately. I'm not so fond of their decoration however. They have a white and red theme going on. It's nothing off putting but you notice it. On the first floor (this place has an upper level), there's a giant tree that's randomly place in the middle of the dining area. Again, you note it. It's quite random. It's like they want us to feel like we're outside inside. I don't think that worked really well. I definitely need to order the other plates to (chicken, fish, etc.) to have a better opinion on their entire menu. At least I'm fond of the steaks."

I really thought ""this is queens village.. a bagel with LOX AND CREAM CHEESE?? I did a search on yelp.. there is Stella's!! I did that order and my husband WAS EXTREMELY HAPPY!! We order from them once a month or so. Always the picture of PERFECTION!! A must to try is their PINA COLADA!! A dish to avoid lemon ricotta pancakes.

Can not comprehend how someone can mess something so simple like pancakes this badly. The homemade rice pudding? Starchy glue with cinnamon. Again, revolting. The women on the phone where extremely rude, and dismissive. Heard them talking trash in Spanish; assuming we wouldn't understand. This facility is the embodiment of unprofessional.

She took my order and returned with a nice hot glass of water for my peppermint tea. The decor is that of an older woman that wants to make her home ""elegant"". There are ivy house plants in the windows and the tables are adorned with artificial flavors with matching colors to go with the season. My breakfast friend and it was as I ordered.  Scrambled eggs with pepperjack cheese and a Belgian waffle.  (Pardon the eggs, I started eating and then realized I forgot to get the money shot). The only thing I would say needs a little more attention is when it's time to get the check. I believe my server may have been eating at the computer which delayed her response time. On that particular day, I wasnt in a rush so I let it slide."

I couldn't even tell if it was poorly seasoned and y'all put a whole bottle of vinegar in it or if it was spoiled and the potatoes fermented and went bad. My tongue felt numb after one bite.

Shalom Japan is a modern Jewish and Japanese fusion dining experience with such high quality food. The combination of the two cuisine flavor profile is so unusual yet works so well together!We came for the 10th Annual Christmas Eve dinner, prix fixe for $75 with an assortment of appetizers, entree, and dessert. The ambiance of the restaurant is super cozy, it probably fits 30 guests with dimly lit candles on each table and a projector playing My Neighbor Totoro.The appetizers / starters: -Caesar salad, beet jew egg, mushroom karage, okonomi-latke-Each dish was so unique-My favorite 1: Beet Jew Egg, the egg was encrusted in almost a Chinese like five spices flavor and complemented so well to the beets, dill and sour cream-My favorite 2: mushroom karage - the mushroom was slightly crunchy, softly fried and it was so juicy on the inside, little pockets of flavor, WOW!Entrees: lox bowl, A5 miyazaki beef hot pot -the lox bowl had a bunch of ingredients, like a fancy poke bowl, the fish was super fresh and complemented really well to the rice underneath and the fish roe topping (I don't usually like fish roe but this one I actually liked the combo!)- A5 miyazaki beef hot pot: the beef is like melt in your mouth, buttery, there was a treasure cove of goodness in there - radish, mushrooms, cabbage, veggies, noodles, absolutely incredible!Dessert: sweet potato cheesecake, banana challah bread pudding-the sweet potato cheesecake was light, fluffy, and slightly sweet, growing up in Asian cultures my desserts are always only lightly sweet so this really hits home for me!-banana challah bread pudding: the challah soaked in the sauce so well, each bite was incredibleBy the end of this meal, we were very full and satisfied. Each dish was so unique, the ingredients were high quality, we loved every single dish. Needless to say, I recommend trying this spot out - it's a great date night spot and an unique find in NYC dining scene. I'll definitely be back again, I want to try the ramen!Kudos to the chefs here for doing a great job curating the fusion menu :)p.s.- For more food visuals including this spot, check me out on IG: @alice.likes.food"

The servers were very friendly.Food: We only got the Matzoh Ball Ramen because it was BOGO. This was my first time having a matzoh ball soup and I enjoyed it a lot. The char siu chicken in the ramen was very tender and probably my favorite thing about the ramen.Drinks: We got BOGO Sapporo Beers, which was also a great deal!Highly recommend checking this place out! I don't know much about Jewish food, but I enjoyed it a lot."
72,vpkTNjq9dRh9rT3Nh0pe-A,3/4/2023,3 star rating,"The waiter, my tea and the butter for the challah were the highlights of my dining experience.We we're informed that the menu was meant to be eaten family style which was fine with us as we wanted to try a variety of dishes from the small menu. I've had this restaurant on my list for quite some time and was highly intrigued by the Jewish and Japanese fusion dishes. Unfortunately the food was underwhelming. The portions were small, the prices were high, and the flavor was minimal. I am leaving 3 stars just because of how great our waiter was. He truly deserved 5 stars on his own! The staff brought the dishes quickly and while they were still warm despite it being a full restaurant. I'd also like to mention the restaurant is small and we did not have a reservation. However we were seated quickly in the overflow area that was a covered outside spot with heaters. The heaters were directly above our table which kept us warm. This area was small but we didn't mind it because we had more space than guests dining in the main area. They kept the divider door closed and would only open one half of it for guests and the waiters which was odd because it was a fairly tiny opening that you'd have to almost shimmy through. If you do plan on coming make a reservation. Jew Egg - Although it's appealing I'd recommend skipping it. For $17 I'd expect more. The yogurt dip that came with it was fine but it didn't add much to the dish and lacked tang. I'm not an egg expert but my friend mentioned it lacked the runniness soft boiled eggs typical have. Challah bread and raisin butter - the bread was quite good and came warm. The star of the show in my opinion was the raisin butter. However if this is what you're coming for I'm sure you can find a bakery in the area to serve as an alternative.Wagyu Sando - Skip this. The sandwich was just fatty meat on plain bread. The pickle to me tasted as if someone covered a cucumber in salt to extract the water for a different dish but changed their mind and served it as a pickle. Mazemen - This noodle dish was described to us as broth-less and creamy with an Unami flavor. We opted to not add an egg because we assumed the dish itself was creamy enough and the addition would be an overkill - we were right. While it wasn't the most flavorful item it was just fine and probably the best thing we ate. My friend had a yuzu cocktail which was actually delicious. I'd say this place would be best suited for someone interested in getting drinks and maybe a small plate or two. I wouldn't recommend this as a dinner destination and would not come with a party larger than 2."

74,vpkTNjq9dRh9rT3Nh0pe-A,2/11/2023,5 star rating,"I was very intrigued by this concept of Japanese and Jewish fusion! The menu was interesting - wagyu pastrami sando, egg sandwich on challah bread, matzoh ramen, etc. I went with the okonomiyaki since that isn't very common in Japanese restaurants in new york, and it exceeded all my expectations. I really liked the crispiness and flavor of the dish, complemented by the kewpie mayo and small bites of wagyu. It was quite dense though and I was very full by the end of the meal. The restaurant is also quite small so make a reservation in advance!"
75,vpkTNjq9dRh9rT3Nh0pe-A,12/26/2022,5 star rating,10/10 Jewish-Japanese fusion restaurant! Ordering the challah is a must. Comes out super fresh and warm with a divine homemade butter for spreading. The matzoh ball ramen was perfection for a cold winter day! Super friendly service and quick given the very crowded restaurant. This spot is super cozy and warm and perfect for date night.

Sunday morning after the 4th July, visiting NY we decided to go there, i was seating in the table with my family for about 30 min, nobody came to see if we needed anything. You don't feel welcome on this place, not friendly at all. I wouldn't recommend it at all."
81,Gh4TyhJSqL_24fplLvVpGw,5/1/2021,1 star rating,"It's very hard for me to leave this 1-star review for the cafe, but it needs to be said so others would know what they're getting into.. I've been going here for over 2 years with friends and the food has been great and servers very professional. However, I recently had a terrible experience with the owner/manager of the place whom I've never previously met, after which I will no longer step foot in the place. My friend and I visited few days ago where we ordered a hookah and I ordered a dessert on the side. The server we had was very polite and brought our orders. He took awhile to come back with the receipt so I went inside to pay. He processed the payment but never gave me my receipt. I didn't make much of it until later that evening when I realized we paid an awful lot for just hookah and a dessert. I called the next day and the manager picked up, asking me for the receipt but after I explained him the situation  and asked what the price of the hookah was, and why we ended up paying $46 for just hookah and a piece of dessert, he was very rude and said I needed to come in to show him the server. I went in 2 days later after work and found that nice waiter who recognized me. He explained everything clearly and said there were extra charges for additional waters (I had completely forgotten about those) and the full amount was such and such..I admitted I'd forgotten about the few waters we ordered and thanked him. We had a pleasant conversation, he printed out the receipt and handed to me and I was about to walk away. Apparently that garbage of a manager was creepily hearing in on the whole conversation, but I wasn't aware since I never saw him before. Suddenly he  interjects and starts yelling: ""excuse me you're the one who called me the other day about the hookah, why are you lying and saying you only got hookah when you got dessert too? You said you had no drinks just hookah and nothing else, you lying!"" I and the waiter were looking at him like he's crazy. I told him I asked for the price of the hookah over the phone but he never gave it to me and asked me to come in to ID the waiter. But he kept running with it...he insisted that I'm lying and kept repeating himself. What's worse is his shameless   unprofessionalism... he's screaming and accusing a customer for lying when there are other customers around looking at him...he looked like a crazy man,, arguing over nothing...he was humiliating himself even though the small situation was already fully resolved by myself and the waiter. Clearly he was after an ego trip and not for professionalism or decent hospitality. He then stampedes out the door to talk to someone sitting in the outdoor patio and shuts the door behind him, I open it to leave and turn around and tell him point blank: ""your behavior was very disrespectful...where I come from, accusing customers for lying and disrespecting them is completely unacceptable. Your server did a very professional job and didn't give us any issues,, and you get in the convo and act so rudely.. I've been coming here for years with friends and we will never come back here again."" As I'm walking out he goes,""thank you, thank you."" Fair warning guys...the food is good, the servers are nice (although not always timely), but clearly the manager/owner is mentally unwell. My heart aches for any of his employees who have to work under his wrath. There are far too many good eateries in NYC without the negative drama, so I wouldn't waste another minute here, especially if you want to come in with your loved ones and leave on a positive vibe."

We saw some guy smoking and decided why the eff not! This was GOOD hookah, and for whatever reason,  recently, I've been getting garbage hookah at these random spots that I've go to. Our hookah was strong, and lasted us over an hour with out needing to change the coals once, and even at that point we could've continued blowing 0's, but our parking was about to expire--- so we had to leave. They designate one side to where you can smoke, but you can also order food/drinks in that section as well.  I'll definitely be back for the hookah & maybe next time I'll dip my little paws into a slice of cake too!"

After that I stood up and asked a server if he could take my order. He apologized for the wait and said he would be with right me. I took a seat again and after 15 more minutes NO SERVICE. Keep in mind it is not busy and there are only 3-4 parties sitting outside. After that I just got up and left. If the service is this bad I can't imagine the food.

Took them home and shared with my mom and aunt. My mother loved the dulce one, they were yummy moist cakes. i will be coming back for more. $7 bucks for 2 slices shared amongst 3 just to cure that sweet tooth craving."

The tasty food is definitely the star but the friendly staff and comfortable booths make it fun place to be. Full Chinese menu and Spanish/Cuban menu - both cuisines done to perfection. Great place to go even for cocktails and appetizers. I recommend pina colada, mojito, margarita and any rum drink; martinis are made to perfection. The higher prices get you better quality food, generous portions and all the extras. First class in all areas.While I love Nuevo Jardin for the delicious food, I have come to rely on this friendly spot for a much needed cocktail and some tasty appetizers. It may be a refreshing mojito, a festive rum drink or an elegant martini. It is the perfect way to start the week or enjoy a mid-week treat and let's not forget the weekends!!

Expect to get some complimentary bread when you sit down along with some              Steamed Dumplings: I've always enjoyed steamed dublings and these were no exception.  Paired with some soy sauce that thankfully wasn't overly salty, this dish is a good appetizer and/or entree dish.              Camarones Ajillo: Not a bad dish but would have liked to see a bit more shrimp on the pate for the price.  The dish was heavily covered with the garlic sauce and onions but it was tasty nonetheless.   The food is good in portion size and taste, the decor is nice and the service is great! They have a wide variety of specialized cocktails in various sizes and regular alcoholic beverages of your choosing.  If in the Astoria area and looking for Asian/Latino fusion then I come on by and give this place a try."

106,Fm2XUIqr62M6IznAS-kJBw,1/1/2021,4 star rating,"Okay. I've gone here a few times the last decade or so. Is it the greatest Chinese restaurant I've ever been to? Nah. And yes, they do fuse some Latin flavor into the typical American Chinese takeout - but man their portions are pretty damn hefty. It's a little more. But stuff like their fried pork chops (which comes with 2 pieces) are MASSIVE. It's not some Michelin or authentic experience you'll get in Flushing or Chinatown, but around the block the food here will satisfy your hunger.Let's also add that they've got some boooooozzzy a$$ drinks as well. Some powerful concoctions. They're pretty attentive service wise (and almost all of my experiences have been through take out)."

Everything was sooo delicious!! The granola crusted French toast was a standout - the granola added a nice crunch to the soft, fluffy toast and the berries added a burst of sweetness. The fried chicken and mac and cheese were both perfectly creamy and flavorful, and the barbeque wings had just the right amount of spice. The cheeseburger and fries were also delicious  the burger was juicy and the fries were crispy and well seasoned.The service at Peaches Hothouse was also excellent.

The vibe is funky, service is good and the very hot shrimp are on point! No matter what your spice level is, be prepared to get great flavor as well. Corn bread, collards and Mac & Cheese will not disappoint. I brought home Nashville very hot for my wife...she loved it. My friend and I ran into the owner Craig while we were there, he could not have been nicer or more genuine. If you're looking for a great meal at a great price...look no further. This restaurant is a real treat."

My boyfriend, his family and I ordered the granola crusted French toast with berries, eggs, fried chicken, mac and cheese with barbeque wings, and a cheeseburger with fries. Everything was sooo delicious!! The granola crusted French toast was a standout - the granola added a nice crunch to the soft, fluffy toast and the berries added a burst of sweetness. The fried chicken and mac and cheese were both perfectly creamy and flavorful, and the barbeque wings had just the right amount of spice. The cheeseburger and fries were also delicious  the burger was juicy and the fries were crispy and well seasoned.The service at Peaches Hothouse was also excellent. Our server was attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere was laid back and comfortable. Overall, I always have a fantastic experience at Peaches Hothouse and would highly recommend it to anyone in the area looking for an amazing brunch with a cozy atmosphere!"

I usually get my wife the fried shrimp and my mother in love enjoys the chicken. We always get the sweet potato fries. Still haven't found a place that has better fries.
130,go9fTb59h5WJ_e5Guw-Y8g,6/4/2022,3 star rating,"3.5.Ventured here for a late breakfast with my daughter. It wasn't very crowded and I saw a couple seats outside-- so I asked and was granted permission to sit outside. We are hungry and quickly knew what we wanted. Ordered a cheeseburger, which they call a hothouse burger and the basic breakfast (eggs, grits, toast) and a side of home fries; sounds simple enough-- well I thought so, but apparently not here.As I mentioned earlier, it was relatively empty, but it picked up well after our order was placed. Yet, the food took quite awhile and the order was incorrect. There was no cheese on the burger and for some reason I had eggs and French Fries (which I never ordered) but what happened to the grits and home fries? I track down the waitress and she seems a little confused-- she informs me that she will find out what happened. She returns and lets me know she can bring me a piece of cheese. I then inform her I'll just keep the fries and forget about the home fries and just give me an order of grits because I didn't want to give her a hard time but I was just confused about why this was such a difficult mission.The food was good, but the service turned me off a bit. I've been to Peaches before and the wait time is extensive, but the difference is, at the main location on Lewis, it's wall to wall with people-- this wasn't the case here. I'll probably stick with the Lewis Ave location going forward."
131,go9fTb59h5WJ_e5Guw-Y8g,2/11/2023,4 star rating,A staple of my neighborhood in Bedstuy I come here for the Nashville chicken and catfish. I usually get it hot and with aioli sauce. The fries are crisp and good and so is the collard greens. When I dine in I enjoy a good cocktail. Truly appreciated this restaurant staying open during the height of the pandemic. I can't believe it took me this long to review it. One of my faves.

They have tobys estate and Stumptown coffees on offer. Also a selection of sandwiches and juices which I have not yet tried. I particularly like the breve and swing by here every once in a while to have it.My biggest turn off from this spot and what keeps me from visiting more frequently is that the staff has always been frosty and indifferent. Not even a half smile ever. It makes you feel rather unwelcome and as if you are imposing. Its a really cool spot and has the potential to have such a great vibe but sadly, it doesn't."

(Side note: How pretentious is the word ""ambiance?"") They have a nice selection of teas, coffees, pastries, and even fresh juices. Matcha latte was very good (ask for it unsweetened if you don't want honey). They also have a food menu which is in an interesting location (behind you when you are standing facing the register). Dodo birds like me wouldn't notice it at first so I'm saving you the embarrassment of asking about it. (You're welcome.)Not a lot of vegan food options unless you are hip enough to fux wit avocado toast. But it's cool...I am happy with wifi and a good matcha. They have a good selection of non dairy milks cause ain't nobody got time for lactose intoleration."
146,go9fTb59h5WJ_e5Guw-Y8g,2/10/2018,2 star rating,"I stopped in to get an Americano. The espresso was weak & for $3.50, it was disappointing. The service was lacking, and here's why. I asked for a small Americano in a medium cup, & the girl filled the cup all the way to the top with water, so my drink was watered down. That's fine. I asked for another shot & paid $1.63. But when the girl at the counter seemed annoyed & bothered as if I made a mistake, it got my attention.            So she dumps out half my drink & adds the extra shot now, & now my Americano is too strong. Mistakes happen but when you have an attitude & you're paying over priced amounts, it's a turn off. Won't be back there again, as there's plenty of coffee places with better espresso. Some advice for the girl at the counter with the attitude; you're not doing anyone a favor, you're just serving coffees, so maybe in a world of trolls you might be cool, but in this world you're just another person serving coffee. Not that there's anything wrong with serving coffee. #countergirlswithbadattitudes"

She was so nasty. Quiet honestly, if you don't like your job she should quit. There are plenty of people who would love to have a job during the pandemic. Her appearance was sloppy and dirty as well.

As you approach the entrance there were bags of garbage pressed up against the glass. made me wonder if I really wanted to go in but we did. The store inside had separation panels so it was covid safe. We were greeted by the only staff in there as we walked in. She said hello and how can I help you while looking down at whatever she was doing.  No eye contact at all! We ordered the medium pomegranate and when it was time for toppings her attitude went up a notch. Everytime I asked for another topping she's like ""what else?"". She was not happy to be doing any business. She just wanted us out of there. As we were finishing up about purchase, two kids walked and she openly said ""oh God they don't stop coming"". She was so nasty. Quiet honestly, if you don't like your job she should quit. There are plenty of people who would love to have a job during the pandemic. Her appearance was sloppy and dirty as well. The shirt she was wearing was full of stains. I can't say if the dirt/stain was from working that shift or not but I don't think will go back again."

If you like frozen yogurt you should definitely try Pinkberry I always get the Pomegranate flavor, since I've tried that I never go back to the original. They do have seasonal flavors but I always go back to the pomegranate it's my favorite, has a nice tang to it. Hard to find parking in this location because it is in park slope so maybe have a buddy come with you and one of you stay in the car so you don't need to look for parking. I see that they have the bubble waffle now it's like a Hong Kong egg waffle which I love, never tried it with the frozen yogurt but I'm sure it would be good. I honestly think Pinkberry is better than red mango. I think red mango's frozen yogurt is a little on the sweeter side, and I like my yogurt to have a little tartness to it, but that's just me.

Turns out the same thing happened to my neighbor when he ordered from them. Not cool.The next time, we decided to go in and eat there instead of delivery, because that was clearly a problem area for them (and that's a serious problem for a Chinese take-out place!!). The food was cold when we got it, and we were sitting there waiting for it! When we complained, they refused to change it. Needless to say, we walked out. Never again.

The French onion soup is a must have and the cheese was bubbling with ooey gooey perfection over a deep aromatic broth. Don't count out the beef bourguignon which has the perfect amount of Smokey bacon to root vegetable to beef, all next to an airy mashed potato. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is the crème brûlée was just subpar. It tasted like whipped crème and didn't have that dense custard taste that I love. All in all, this is a must try restaurant."
203,eGIY_25KFspf8KefDQMj-Q,10/13/2022,4 star rating,"Many ages ago, I was actually on #TeamFlorent when it came to Meat Packing District dining.  However, they sadly closed and Pastis helped fill that void.  It's been over a decade since I've been to Pastis, but they still deliver delicious French food in a fun atmosphere. Steak Tartare: In a world where tuna tartare is so common, it's nice to still find steak tartare served.  Tender beef cut into the tiniest of cubes.  Mixed in a tangy flavorful sauce with visible herbs and a whole yolk on top.  So you have to do a little mixing yourself.  Tastes delicious against the thin and crunchy crostini, which helps the focus stay on the steak while only adding a little crunch.  Though they could have used a few more pieces of crostini in my opinion for the large portion of tartare.  The slightly bitter greens and vinaigrette on the side were good for cleansing the palate between bites.Moules Frites: Another brasserie favorite of mine.  They had good quality mussels since only one refused to open and thus had to be discarded.  The rest were fresh with a slight ocean taste.  Loved loved loved the buttery wine sauce so did a lot of slurping.  It was especially nice with the crunchy fries.  Lots of that sauce, so plenty remaining after everything else was eaten.  Ends up being deceptively filling all in.Profiteroles: There's always room for dessert, even after a rich meal.  I especially loved how the warm chocolate sauce was poured over profiteroles at the table; it was quite dramatic.  They had the perfect texture contrast of fluffy choux pastry and rich in-house vanilla ice cream.  The chocolate sauce pour was quite generous, so it was almost like they were dessert matzo balls in a chocolate soup."

Reserved ahead and asked for a nice table as a Resy Global Dining Access member but while seated indoors, we weren't seated in the nicer area indoors so that was a bit of a letdown.Started off with a round of champagne as we were celebrating personal milestones, I kindly asked that this be a separate check as I bought this for our group. They were able to, which was nice. We were given baguette and butter to start off. We decided to share a couple of starters for the table: fresh oysters, moules frites and onion soup. These were all delicious but my personal favorite were the mussels. Wish we were given more bread to soak up all the remaining sauce. For entrees, the 3 of us went for hanger steak. I asked and was charged for the poivre sauce which was fine, I just wish they'd at least inform ahead. My disappointment is I asked for the steak to be medium rare but it was really rare. I tried to eat the steak but couldn't even finish it halfway, thank God I had fries. The poivre sauce also wasn't good. It lacked the peppery taste and wasn't thick. I wish it was as good as Balthazar's. My husband's Cheeseburger Americaine was fantastic and was the redeeming entrée of the day. This is probably what I'll have if I ever go back. Had another round of champagne after. We ordered cappuccinos and profiteroles for dessert. The profiteroles were nice.Overall, service was good despite being very busy and at times slow. But the vibe and energy of the place is what you come here for. We went here on Dec. 26th and was a Monday so not sure if the regular kitchen staff were out post the Christmas service. Look forward to coming back and hopefully everything would be much better."

Firstly the service here is impeccable! Very attentive and kind. The atmosphere is also wonderful, it has such a vibrant yet romantic energy. It is a little cliche but it does bring back the feeling of being in the more touristy parts of Paris. The food is also simple but consistent and perfectly executed. I absolutely love the roast chicken here. It is always perfectly tender and the jus is so flavorful! It's perfect to dip fries or vegetables into. You also must order the haricot verts with your meal, it is the perfectly executed side dish with the right amount of garlic. The shrimp cocktail is also wonderful here if your looking for something smaller, or some seafood to begin your meal. Overall this is one of my top places to eat in NYC and I'd recommend it to anyone!"

I totally get why this is a hot spot, book in advance especially if looking for a table in the evening. I've had a lot of burgers in my life, but the cheeseburger at Pastis is definitely in the top 10 I've ever had. Prepared in a traditional fashion on a sesame seeded bun, this is classic and packed with freshness and flavor. The fries were 5 stars as well, cooked perfectly with a little crisp to it which is exactly how I like them. My dad got the Bouillabaisse and said it was probably the best of his life.

The counter help was very rude and nasty, No customer service skills whatsoever. My order came out wrong so I had to wait at the counter to rectify the issue. I get back to the table and everyone had already eaten pretty much. Obviously you have to eat fast food fast or the taste goes out the window. More alarming was the amount of garbage throughout the establishment. Food left on tables, food underneath tables, overflowing receptacles everywhere you looked. Not one worker would clean a table. The next day I attempted three times and three different ways to touch base with the corporate office. No replies to my emails nor my voicemails. I ended up leaving a derogatory review on their website but still no reply back. For the amount of money Wendy's  charge, One would think that you would get better service and a more pleasurable experience.

However, this location is by far THEE WORST Wendy's I've ever been to. Working as a nurse at SIUH North, I have unfortunately been forced to frequent this establishment more times then I can count due to a lack of options during my overnight shift. Yet every time, this ""restaurant"" somehow manages to top their previous piss poor performance. I have made numerous complaints to not only management but corporate, as I feel that writing reviews is not always the way to go. However I am out of options. Tonight I received a meal that was missing two fries out of my five fry order. Two drinks were also missing. Yet for some reason I was charged. My 10 piece nugget only had 8. One nugget was a complete solid. Upon further inspection, the nugget was actually just fried chicken bone... yum. The workers ask you what sauce you want with every individual nugget order, but then proceed to give you no sauce at all. I must also state that at my last visit sometime last week, I arrived at the ordering window at 1 am, only to be asked ""We're closing in two hours, why are you here?"" DO NOT VISIT THIS SPOT"

We never saw her face or got her name, hence our time and date stamps.

The outdoor seating area artwork is what caught my eye. I ordered a hazelnut ice latte with oat milk medium size. Even though the coffee was spot on and delicious. I did think the price was a little much. $5.99 for a medium size coffee. But then again it's a lot better than almost $8 for Starbucks in times sq nyc. After telling my wife about The Barn we decided to go the next day and pick up coffee and a bite to eat. We got two ham and cheese empanadas and they were so GOOD! Highly recommend this place if you want a good coffee and something quick to eat.

I always go to the same place, so I made it a goal to try a new one every week.This was my first new place to visit. I really loved the coffee. I got an ice latte with pumpkin spice. It was delicious.It is a lot smaller than what I expected, but they do have a large outdoor set up which I'm sure would be beautiful to sip ice coffee in during the spring/summer. Friendly staff, and great coffee. They also offer smoothies and other options. I recommend it, and will be back!"

The seating area includes different kind of wooden lounge chair and looked nice. Staff is friendly and was happy to serve variety of drinks, smoothies, sandwiches, and pastries. The strawberry financier is delicious! Just the right size to satisfy a craving for something sweet. There were financier with pineapples and other fruits too, and I'm sure they are also great. The coffee shop also sells coffee-related goods like Japanese mugs. I recommend stopping by and checking out the place when you're nearby!"

Great ambiance with tons of natural light, and located just outside of the heart of Williamsburg next to McCarren park.Food was fabulous, and the drinks did not disappoint. Try a spicy margarita or a Paloma with a Tajin salted rim for a refreshing afternoon pick me up. Absolutely do not skimp on trying the corn based pancakes with a mint and berry compote. As a group of 5 we split the pancakes for dessert and DEVOURED them. Warm and filling yet fresh from the mint and berries, it ended our brunch on a sweet note.Definitely more optimal for smaller parties (6 or less) who prefer to pay a la cart. Casa Publica is not your typical bottomless brunch spot in the city, but you get what you pay for. Portions are average sized, at about $15-$20 a plate, and are personalized (rather than family style).Service was excellent and appreciated that they did not rush us out. Would be 5 stars, but the brunch menu was not posted online which made it hard for folks with allergies to decide what they could eat ahead of time."

Being from Texas, we know good Mexican food so I was a little bit skeptical if we would be impressed by the food and margaritas offered at Casa Publica. Happy to say that we were very impressed. The tuna tostadas are a must order - they were out of this world good and a great way to start the meal. We also ordered the pollo al pastor and steak tacos and thought both were great. Margs were a hit - especially with the different flavors you can add. The only miss was our service was just okay. The waitress started off strong but then kind of disappeared for the rest of the meal, which is why I will give this 4 stars rather than 5. This is definitely a spot we would return to in New York. We are glad we went and would recommend to anyone in the area."

And rather large -- amazing flavorGUAC: the guac is always fresh and tasty, but the chips are really the all-star hereAl pastor: simple, but deliciousGOOD:Mushroom tacos: a very interesting flavor profile of sweet and savory, but there was something missing -- maybe a crunch or a spice Enchiladas: another good veggie option, but also could have had a little more flavorThe ambiance is great, too!

Bring cash for tokens so you can play all the games (which are all .25 cents- .50 cents a play). The machines don't use quarters but instead the tokens available there. I was disappointed by the lack of DDR lol but otherwise good game variety. Crowded but not too crowded. Bar had great selection of beers on tap and there was some bar food on the menu though we didn't indulge!"

It's a different vibe then most bars but the beers are really good. There are a lot of arcade games to choose from. Great to come with friends or even a date night. If you like IPA I highly recommend the yes farm yes beer one!
244,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,7/17/2021,2 star rating,"This location of barcade was way too crowded and just terrible. Granted I went on a Saturday night and I knew the wait was going to be long to get drinks, but I just flat out did not enjoy this location as much as the Williamsburg location. The ambiance was terrible. Horrible, loud, headache inducing songs were played... and lets not even mention the drinks. I ordered 2 whisky sours and it was entirely corn syrup water mixed with a teeeeeny tiny bit of whisky. I couldn't drink it. That was $15 (per drink) down the drain. I wish I could've taken a picture of how you can see the syrup floating in the drink (I could not because it was too dark inside). The only thing that was okay was the tequila shots ... but then again... you can't mess up shots. It is literally straight from a bottle. I had 3 gin and tonics (which I had to ask them to mix with club soda instead of their liquid sugar tonic water), but even then I only had a SLIGHT buzz. The Williamsburg location is literally a better bang for your buck! So go there instead."

Not really somewhere to come hang out if you don't want to play games (duh) and don't expect to have fancy cocktails here but if in the mood it's a great time! Note that we came really late in the evening and it was not at all crowded and we could play any game that we wanted - not sure if it gets annoyingly crowded earlier in the evening."

Although the restaurant was dead that night, we wanted to try their brunch on Sunday since we had really good service and great food. First Impression:When you first enter, there is a long bar to your left. You have to walk about halfway into the restaurant if you want to be seated so the layout is a bit awkward. They have indoor seating which is dark and an enclosed patio. For brunch today, we asked for outdoor seating as the inside just seemed a bit too dark. We had our daughter in her carrier and they tried to seat us at a two person table and that just wasn't going to work because I'm not putting my daughter on the ground. So I asked if we could sit at a four person table off to the side. Food:Honestly, I had high expectations for food from lobster night and they did not disappoint. Their brunch is $12 and includes your choice of Bloody Mary, Mimosa or Screwdriver. Any additional drinks are $2 each. You also get a bread basket of assorted breads, jam and butter, fruit cup, entree and coffee or tea. Bread Basket - all the baked goods were fresh. Our favorite was what looked like a scone with raisins and nuts. I wish the butter wasn't chilled as it is impossible to spread but this can be overlooked as the bread is also delicious without the butter. Fruit Cup - a mix of grapes, pineapple, honeydew, cantaloupe, and mine had what was a speck of a strawberry. Fresh, ripe and not mushy. Mimosa and Screwdriver - heavier on the OJ than the vodka or champagne but you can't complain considering the first drink is included with your meal. Both were garnished with a fresh orange slice. Burger - the Fries were just as delicious as I remembered them from my fish and chips. Juicy burger cooked to order. Good portion size. Recommended. Eggs Benedict - served with potatoes, onions and red bell pepper. The potatoes were buttery and well seasoned. The eggs were poached beautifully and served on top of grilled ham and a toasted English muffin. Hollandaise sauce was definitely made from scratch and also delicious. Also a good portion size. Recommended. Coffee - on the strong side which is how we personally like our coffee. Overall - we were dying on the patio. My husband was literally pouring sweat. There is one portion that does not have the sun blocked and they had a heater blaring so we were baking at the table. My husband had finished his screwdriver and water but did not get a refill. He was so overheated he had my water as well. Coffee was also empty. Another couple came in as we were paying the bill. They were being seated next to the heater in the sun and said they would rather wait than die in the heat. Service can be improved for brunch but we didn't see a lot of servers considering how packed the restaurant got. Food was good but restaurant setup and service could improve."

Not sure if we just got lucky or 2:30pm is just the perfect time to eat brunch here because the place wasn't packed and we were seated immediately. For $11.95 you can basically eat like a pig. You get a delicious bread basket for the table and a cup of fruit. You can choose from a mimosa, screwdriver or a Bloody Mary plus coffee or Tea, then you get to pick an Entree. The selection for the Entree's are deliciously yummy but I kept it traditional and went for the Eggs Benedict. I consider myself an Eggs Benedict connoisseur and as you all know it's all about the Hollandaise sauce. What can I say....they NAILED IT!!!!!I will definitely be returning here and bringing all of my friends."

First of, they advertise a brunch deal for $11.95 which includes a free bread basket, fruit, an entree (reasonable options from salad, burger, eggs and French toast) and two drinks (mimosa, screwdriver, Bloody Mary). My husband and I were really impressed with the amount of food for the price. I got the eggs with buttery home fries and my husband got the burger and both were pretty good. We both got mimosas and they were both decent. A little light on the alcohol but aren't all mimosas that way. The service was excellent and the staff was very attentive. I will be back and highly recommend it for brunch. They also have a Monday night special that I def wanna check out!"

It's unfortunate because the bride was supposed to be surprised but ended up walking in when bridesmaids were scrambling around to put up decorations since servers allowed people to sit and eat when the girls were supposed to set up. Towards the end of the party, there were ants all over the bar which then got all over the desserts the girls made which is absolutely disgusting. At one point... the maid of honor was clearing plated from the tables because the busboys were so slow. Only one server for 30-40 women. We had a horrible experience here we will never go back."

However a few weeks ago I was sitting at the bar and saw this sign across from me. I will no longer go to or recommend Maggie mays to anyone until the owner of this bar recognizes and respects that social inequality exists and has absolutely nothing to do with a flag or an anthem. I am saddened for you that you let your ignorance of privilege get in the way of enjoying a football game. You will never receive my business again."

The appetizer bread that was served to us was rock hard, cold and burnt. I told my waiter and he quickly brought a fresh batch, which was soft, warm and well-baked. But the fact that they served such stale and obviously burnt (black) bread was odd.2. Did not like the menu. Does not clearly label which items are vegetarian and which are not (for example, the Papardelle contains pork but at some restaurants, it is only beef). I had the Triangoli pasta and it tasted like there was pork in it although the menu did not state whether there was pork in it.3. Very expensive. $34 for vegetarian pasta?Will not be back."

But in our last visit this week we were disappointed by the blatant cheapness in portions, wine pours, and lack of service grace. The downtown vibe remains but at the relatively lofty prices Sfoglia has forgotten that value is critical. We felt rushed and we felt management was no longer there to please the patrons but to manage profitability. A smile out of the bar tender would have been welcome too. We will come back as the bolognese is special but I miss the old Sfoglia."
266,MPV-rSjFjfxJDjOV97NwUw,12/8/2021,5 star rating,"I went here last week with my family of 8. The staff was accommodating to our large party, and we had a great table that comfortably fit us all. The decor and ambiance were charming and very well done. The service was good--they let us know that some entrees take a while, so prompted us to get our order in. The wine and drinks (a Negroni) we're all good. For food, I wanted to try the entire menu, but had the Branzino (cooked in parchment with cauliflower and leeks). It was excellent. My portion of fish was huge, but others in my party had slightly smaller portions. The cauliflower and leeks added incredible flavor but did not overwhelm the fish. I shared broccolini (good) and acorn squash (incredible) as side dishes. Cannot stress enough how amazing the roasted squash was! It had radicchio and Parmesan cheese and a sage pesto, but the squash itself was the main flavor. Will return just for this dish. Other dishes that were ordered by my table were: tagliatelle with octopus (octopus was cooked well but overall the dish was good, not a show stopper), papardelle with meat ragú (really really good hearty meat sauce--my gluten free family members ordered it with gluten free pasta, and it wasn't as good as the dish with the gluten-papardelle), roasted chicken (really well cooked, large portion, but didn't come with any sort of side/accoutrement). For dessert we pre-ordered the bread pudding with currants, which was super decadent. It smelled of warm butter and was hot and very thick/custard-y. Very rich, so only order if you are sharing with the entire table. Overall: 10/10. Prices were not great, but seeing as this was one of the best meals I've had on the Upper East Side, I will definitely be returning!"

I tried to educate them very politely on the ADA and what they should be doing versus what they were doing. They became  very confrontational and quite rude, I have everything documented and quite frankly I can't speak to the food and or anything else but what I can speak to you is the fact that they violated federal and state law. For the record we have a federally recognized identification for the service animal and my sister. Hopeful they will educate themselves and their leadership on the importance of ADA accommodations."

Highly suggest the key lime pie for dessert which tasted amazing. Definitely on the pricier side but the food and ambiance are definitely worth it for a special occasion!

For the coffee I would not say super impressed. It's good. As for the breakfast the seasoning is a bit light. And the veggie can be fresher. Overall taste is good and light. It's warm when served. The service is good.

The staff are very friendly and their outdoor seating is the perfect place to catch a quick break during the day or meet a friend for a coffee. Living a block away, its become almost a daily stop."
279,8iWto1WAB0eO91Kp-CYu1g,9/12/2022,3 star rating,"Order drinks in person, because when you order a 12 ounce latte online, they only fill it up to three quarters of the cup. Or CHECK how far they fill it up BEFORE leaving the establishment. It is quite a gamble for them to send a customer a partially filled cup knowing they probably won't unwrap and open their order. Their pastries are purchased from other bakeries and cafes who know how to make them, so expect a markup. But I do applaud their no laptop policy, it is a small cafe, not your personal office space. Customers should have space to eat and drink, not wait for your digital nomad wannabe ass to hoard up seating."

Not only is the vodka sauce all cream as you can tell in the pictures the sauce is literally white with no flavor . They charged me 18$ just for pasta with chicken ??? Small portions , definitely will not be returning ever again !!! Don't waste your time or money !"
282,Aa934EMuqCdEV86faZG-0A,1/17/2017,5 star rating,I love how this restaurant gives you a feel of the past from the 1980's.I love that they never redecorated the dining room.the food is Sicilian and everything and I mean everything is delicious! the service is also incredible.Aldo the owner also has done so much for the neighborhood and  Community of Howard Beach during sandy hurricane and charities he's given back to the community. The bathrooms are clean and the service is good. The prices are incredibly reasonable I would try this family owned restaurant and experience a restaurant from the past.

The pizza is fresh. They only have regular crust pizza though. Wish they make thin crust pizza. #SADface The pasta always tastes al dente and never overcooked. The portions are big and always enough to share. We all like their complementary bread with our order!This is one of our go-to places when we are in the area AND in the mood for Italian food.

287,Aa934EMuqCdEV86faZG-0A,7/20/2019,3 star rating,"I'm struggling writing this review and how many stars to give. I ordered a half tray of pasta and a half tray of house salad for delivery to someone's home. I was charged over $142 for it, which included a fee in excess of $5 because I used a credit card.  I thought it seemed like a lot of money but my mind was distracted that day on other errands and things to tend to. The people I ordered the food for called me and said the food was good but the receipt was on the order when delivered and they told me I paid too much and got ripped off. They sent me a picture of how much the total order cost on Slicelife.com and it was about $50 cheaper than what I paid and the prices listed are SIGNIFICANTLY less than on the menu in the restaurant. I called Aldo's and spoke with someone (manager?)who was very polite and respectful. (I did not mention Slicelife). He looked over my bill and told me I was correct and was charged for a full tray instead of a half tray of salad. He was incredibly apologetic and offered to reimburse me the over-charge either with a restaurant credit, cash or a refund to my credit card. I chose the refund to my card. He explained it could take 3 to 4 business days for it to be reflected and I said okay. Fast forward 11 days - still no refund to my account. I finally had a chance to go back to the restaurant and refreshed his memory. I also told him about and showed him the price differences listed on Slicelife.com. He was surprised and said that those prices were wrong and couldn't imagine where they got them from. He again was apologetic and polite and immediately refunded me the cash - $22, based off the menu they have there in the restaurant.  I'm not really sure how I feel about it. Whether I should have been reimbursed the difference that's on Slicelife or the difference on the menus in the restaurant.  I didn't argue the point because I did order from the menu in the restaurant and not online. I haven't eaten their food yet, other than an upside down Sicilian slice two times. Which was good enough, not great, but good. I was sad when Aldo's was sold the first time and it didn't really work out so well. Aldo's was one of my favorite local pizzerias-local and quick, go-to places for food. I was happy to hear new owners took it over and people were saying good things about the place and the food.  I'm just not sure how I feel about the place because of  this experience and their catering prices seem very overpriced. I found out afterwards that I could've gotten the same tray of pasta from another local Italian restaurant (not pizzeria-restaurant) for less money."

And I love it lol. Idk what took me so long. Its full of communal tables, diverse art, and diverse people. The staff is hella diverse and super chill. You can tell they enjoy working there. The music is def my style lots of afro  and future beats, neo soul, r&b some hip hop. Its just good stuff. There is a small bar that actually pretty short height  wise. Im 6'6 and it sits below my waist. You might as well sit at a table. The drinks however are head and shoulders above much of the neighboring establishments. Their food is homey. All the meats are rotisserie roast on the spot. They offer a nice collection of sides similar to what you would see at Dig Inn. They also over changing chef specials like market fish and tacos. The price is somewhere between casual and restaurant dining. Expect to spend $15-25 (without drinks). You also have to pick up and toss out your own food. Its a really mello place with good offerings"

I think that's the name so good I can't remember!  The staff/cashier was very helpful in explaining everything and suggestion wise.  The vibe is really low key.  One summer day we came in after walking to the park and had drinks in the garden in the back, it was cool.  Will definitely come back without a doubt!Make sure you try the cheesecake! Yum!"

294,MPV-rSjFjfxJDjOV97NwUw,12/27/2021,4 star rating,I've noticed it is a hit or miss depending on the type of person I bring here and also what you order! The good : - Super cute place with delicious food. - Everything is tasty + variety- Drinks are delicious- Mulled Wine is great!- Outdoor seating + heatingThe not so good- Portions are small (depending what you order) - Gets pricey really quick if you order more than 1 item- Not a lot of indoor seating- Kinda awkward waiting to pickup drinks- Outdoor seating is not cute to everyone since some of it is on the floor with bean bags etc. I recommend the Sherperds pie bowl thing for good portions and if you like lamb and some mulled wine for cold winter.Overall it is a cute hangout place and more on the artsy hipster side. Not the best place to pig out but great for drinks and snacking. Maybe good for lunch but have never tried it yet!
295,MPV-rSjFjfxJDjOV97NwUw,1/5/2022,5 star rating,Went to another restaurant and was told if I'm by myself they could only sit me at the bar. So walked around looking for another option. Second place I chose turned out to be closed but it led me to Risbo which was on the same block. It was meant to be. Everyone who worked there was so inviting. The food was all familiar but the preparation was different than anything I ever had before. Such a great experience. Need to come back. I've been craving.
296,MPV-rSjFjfxJDjOV97NwUw,11/29/2021,5 star rating,I love coming to Risbo! It's one of my favorite places to meet up with loved ones. The atmosphere is warm and joyful. The staff is amazing and the food is hearty. I came in on a Friday night recently to have a warm beverage and dessert with a homeboy. The Apple cobbler wasn't fulfilling the sweet tooth craving I had and the bartender was kind enough to let me air my grievances to be shared with his colleagues at a later time. That didn't kill the mood though. My friend was enjoying his Black Gold Grenadian rum and I was in heaven drinking mulled wine for the first time! It was brisk outside and the ambiance at Risbo was cozy and serene. I look forward to being back soon! Much love to the people at Risbo who make it such a special place for all!

298,MPV-rSjFjfxJDjOV97NwUw,11/29/2021,5 star rating,"Wow, this place looks great from the outside but smells even better and has a warm cozy vibe. Place your order at the counter, take a buzzer/number and find a table inside or outside. Choose from communal tables or cute low level seating and cushions in the backyard/outdoor garden patio area. Good music playing and great cocktails to choose from, place your drink order with bartender across from food order counter. Risbo platter rotisserie chicken was really good, also liked the Mac and cheese as well. You can taste the love in it. Boiled stuffed plantain was ok, kind of cold and basic not really necessary. Small assortment of ice cream and sorbet available, really liked the lychee sorbet, 1 scoop even at $4 or 5 was worth it. Definitely a great weekday dinner solo spot or intimate gathering with friends on the weekend."
299,MPV-rSjFjfxJDjOV97NwUw,6/21/2022,4 star rating,Solid healthy fast casual food option. The chicken was very flavorful and not dry at all. I wish their was something to dip into the humus besides the chicken for the platter. The salad was also very tasty and the goat cheese was a nice touch.

I also tried so pasta with a cream sauce I would lick off a NY subway rat. The ambiance is just perfect! With some music playing, but not to the point that you cant have a conversation. My favorite drink was the espresso martini! It ascended me to heaven with one sip. Overall, fabulous service, food and drinks!"

My husband got a watered down dirty martini with the worlds smallest olives. The autum venom was my second drink, that was nice but very much juice.The food - 5/10.

307,8iWto1WAB0eO91Kp-CYu1g,2/11/2023,1 star rating,The artichoke dip was horrible. Microwaved so the cheese was hard and just sat on top of the dip. Was not really a dip because I couldn't break through the cheese. Also the type of cheese was not good either. Really disappointed. Bolognese dish was just okay. Really no flavor. Left hungry for sure. Maybe this is not a place for food just drinks. I didn't try the drinks so I can't vouch for that. Sorry but it was a disappointment overall.
308,8iWto1WAB0eO91Kp-CYu1g,9/23/2022,5 star rating,I've been here a couple times now but today was the first time I came for happy hour.  They have 3 cocktails on happy hour for 10 dollars and several beers for 5. The food is great too!! Will definitely come back to try more.

I had a crossiant-wich (which comes with bacon) and the beyond burger and both dishes are hearty so you will get full. They have some dishes with meat so no one is excluded. I'm a fan of their iced coffee. The staff is attentive and very kind. They have outdoor seating if you prefer. I like coming here for brunch. Looking forward to coming here many more times!"

315,m3PS0tIaa0ChcP8Y5S-DrQ,2/16/2015,3 star rating,"Three point five stars for my first but certainly not my last trip to the Palace of Empanadas if my translation is correct. Early on a Saturday morning, very little is open north of the LIE but south of Jewel Ave and in full functional food serving swing. Less that dissuade my persuit of sustenance, hopefully of the spicey and gut filling kind. I certainly found that within the clean, modern corner empanada spot, but it wasn't an empanada day just yet.Ordering the most pricey menu item set me back $9.00 and filled me to the brim, no further eating was necessary as the hours passed me by to early evening.The rice and beans lurking below the pounded shoe leather beef and the beautifully herbed scrambled egg had to tip the scales at a full pound. I walked with my posture on a slight tilt to my illegally parked car, bursting non- biodegradable food holder in hand, which I consumed while parked outside.The street parking is boarder line impossible.I pulled my overstuffed torso from my cars interior with a mighty Heeve Hoo, in deep thought about this not delicious, not even really good meal. On one hand the quantity was significant but all accounts of taste unfortunately fell short into the 'just average in taste' category, but I sense my next visit will yield much more positive findings, hopefully minus the half day of over consumption waddling."

They where so small and the flavor was blah. The decor is plain there is really no sitting room and it's hot in there. Over all it's okay. Staff greets you walking in and it's clean. Well don't take my word for it. Try it out and make your own reviews and comments. Your experience there might be different.  Enjoy yourself and keep up the good eats.

Their menu has a variety of food it's impossible not to find something you want to eat. They have about everything lol. They seated boots here which I love they are so comfy. They have a room for strollers  and they serve a full bar.I love that the prices are so reasonable and food portion fills you up. I got some French toast and sunny side eggs with sausage and I was so full. My fiancé wanted something lighter and got egg white me vegetables and chicken and it was sooo good.  I have never been here for dinner but they have burgers and other late night foods. They also have great selection of desserts. The parking is available as well the wait was not long for a Sunday morning by it was definitely busy.

When I went in there my headphones were no longer there and there was a different shift working who called the employee whom which I spoke with and said that someone came and picked them.  She literally put them in plain sight, and someone claimed it was there and she gave it to them.  Needless to say, I was livid!!! especially since I gave them my information.  The night manager was not helpful at all and pretty much was trying to tell me that there was nothing they could do.  No way I was taking no for answer, so they called the two owners.  Now!!! to be clear, the female owner was trying to work with me, but her husband (the other owner) was not.  He was basically accusing me of potentially lying in-order to get some money from them.  We went back and forth negotiating and he was super nasty and rude.  RIDICULOUS that I had to be spoken to that way and experience such rudeness as a customer of many years.  The sad part is that I used to enjoy going there but best believe I am super turned off from that experience.  Besides this one experience I've always enjoyed the experience there but to be treated as such....... NO THANK YOU!!!"

I noticed that the diner looks very clean and up to date with no ripped upholstery issues like at most places. I enjoyed my TexMex sandwich while listening to pop music and watching the news and soccer on televisions. Service was polite, quick and accessible. The sandwich was amazing with fresh chicken, fresh vegetables and even fresh bread which is usually a miss at most places. At least the main dish was great since the french fries were horrible. They were so dry that I needed water refills to get them down. Ugh, it was so close to being 5 stars."

Not only were my friends' dishes either improperly prepared or bizarrely lackluster--suffice it to say, I wasn't the only one dissatisfied--but when the waiter was called over to address one of theirs, he caught an attitude, which needed to be quickly reigned in. After their meal was ""rectified"", I received the saddest, poorest excuse for a NY ribeye I have ever seen. With every bite, I swore on my island ancestors I was eating chuleta (pork chop). When this was brought to the Manager's attention, he ""swore on his life"" (quote) this was a quality NY rib eye. Nothing was done to elevate our experience during or after that interaction. We even bonded with the family behind us on our way out, as they told us even their baby didn't want his food. I should've saved my money that day, but I'm sure they won't care about losing a few customers."

I  do not like my liver over cooked and dry. They cooked it just right.  The hash browns were very good, along with the Manhattan chowder. Vegetable were okay. Service was quick and efficient.  Restroom was clean.  If you in the area , it a place to get good diner food."

I made my first visit yesterday when my girlfriend and I came in for brunch at around 11 AM. The place was packed, and we were fourth in line. Fortunately the turnover rate is very high and we were soon seated at a table. I ordered the lumberjack waffle platter: one plain waffle, two eggs, breakfast meat of choice. The waffle was warm with a firm exterior and a soft inside. The eggs were over medium as desired, and I counted five strips of greasy bacon (two were stuck together). All told it was an adequate meal, but not as filling as I'd expected. My girlfriend selected the western omelette with home fries and wheat toast. I got to try a few bites. The omelette was huge and normal, so plain as to be almost tasteless. No cheese, either; perhaps you can request that? The home fries were very disappointing, basically just fried hash browns with little substance. The toast, however, was perfect for dabbing up the yolks of my eggs. The food was basic enough, but ranged from blasé to disappointing. Perhaps that's normal, but the prices ($20/plate on average) had led me to expect more. There's comfort in knowing what to expect from diner food, and you can't ask for too much."

With restaurant seating being limited or by reservation only I was glad we were able to get seated right away. However that was the only good thing about this diner. The food was basic diner fare. Not bad but not good either. The grits looked like rice. If you've had grits before then you know the texture should be smooth, kinda like porridge. The service wasn't the best either.I felt pressure from the waiter to order immediately. Also the waiters move so fast that they don't realize or maybe they do realize but they basically snatch the menu out of your hands. Last but not least when restaurants are supposed to be operating cashless due to the pandemic this place charges a 4% fee when you use a credit card. I understand restaurants have been struggling but to pass this fee off to the customer is unacceptable. It's located near Time Square so I'll most likely never return. The food and the fees aren't worth the trip."

We started with wine.  You can order by the glass, the carafe, or bottle.    The carafe is nice as you get close to 2 glasses for not that much of a price increase over a glass.  The menu is your placemat.    It's fairly limited and is mainly pasta dishes.    I had hoped for some veal dish, but there was nothing.    We started with an appetizer of warm mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto and doused with balsamic vinegar.   The appetizer was good but with just two small pieces, I was wanting more.    They serve warm bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, but the tables are so small and they don't give you bread plates, so we had to eat the bread along with our appetizer so we had somewhere to put the oil and vinegar.I opted for the gnocchi as my entree.   It came out nice and hot and looked appealing.    They were just what you would expect, little dough balls topped with tomato sauce and mozzarella.   For dessert, I shared a tiramisu and it was the highlight of the meal.   So light and tasty, I wish I hadn't decided to share!!!!"

Also enjoyed their build-your-own charcuterie, especially the prosciutto and soppressata. Pastas were executed well and great to share! Clam linguine could use some more clams, as there were quite a few shell-only pieces. Servers were patient and there was minimal wait for dinner walk-ins. Seating includes indoors and outside with heaters! Only nitpick is the tight space and small tables between the 2- and 4-person tables outside; so that you may be elbow-to-elbow with the adjacent patrons. The inside space is tight as well and rectangular, but features full bar seating and a romantic, dimly lit ambiance."

It was an outstanding dish that I would definitely be back for. Overall I loved the restaurant and want to return soon to try their pasta dishes."

For the food -- one of my favorites is the mango, arugula and goat cheese salad it's so fresh! All of the pastas are good, some of our favorites are the mushroom risotto, mac and cheese and penne pesto w artichoke. There's a lot of meat options but no chicken option fyi.

They are not listed on the menu, but they have several milk options including oat and almond. I went with almond milk and the cappuccino is perfectly foamy which is hard to do with almond milk so props to them.The service was great and we love sitting outside enjoying the sun.

It was a bit disappointing that we couldn't find any remarkable taste that would make us want to come back.However, the service was where we encountered the biggest problem. To put it bluntly, it was one of the worst experiences I've had at any establishment. The waiter seemed disinterested and unprofessional, to the point where we had to shout our orders across the room because they were sitting on their phone, showing no signs of interest of taking our order. Even as we ate our meal, they gave us intense stares, making us feel unwelcome and uncomfortable. To make matters worse, I was surprised to find that I didn't receive my credit card back after paying the bill. When I asked the waiter about it, they didn't seem to care, showing no concern or willingness to assist me with the lost credit card situation. This was incredibly unprofessional and disappointing. Later that night I was forced to cancel my credit card.I understand how hard it is to run a restaurant, but unfortunately, I can't recommend Cafe Reggio in good faith. I strongly advise anyone reading this to avoid this establishment altogether and learn from my mistake of going here."

Of course, we ended up here and grabbed two for each of us while watching the baseball game they had on TV along with some old school music videos. We sat at the bar where we were able to get served right away. We were there at around 3PM on a Saturday afternoon, and it wasn't too busy. It looked like there were a few other bars in the area, so it might be a good place for a nice night out! The place looked pretty big too.

After my slice of sausage pizza, I told the guy ""This was really good"" and he replied ""You got good taste"" Hah, love it.The garlic knots were 4 for $1!! Being just 1 person, I couldn't make the room to eat 4 so the lady was nice enough to sell me 2 for .50 cents. I couldn't believe how cheap it was!! Back in the Bay Area, I would have been easily charged $7+ for 4 garlic knots. They were good and full of flavor.The pizza itself had a crispy crust which I liked. The sausage though would be a pass for next time, since they just chop on sausage and put it on a cheese pizza.it definitely seems like a family business and I hope they are able to thrive. Stop by after a visit at Prospect Park or the Botanical Gardens!"
431,3Bjnre3_kCgGR8n7cpL8nA,4/20/2019,5 star rating,"I am biased. This pizza location is my childhood shop. We are talking about my first experience ever having pizza from maybe 6-7 years old. I remember the cheesy pizza stretching with each bite and the crust being crunchy. I have not been there for over 20 years and when I had that first bite, I became a child once again. They didn't take card ( cash only establishment) which is perfectly fine because that's what I've always remembered. But for everyone else I can see that being an issue. The slices are massive and for a guy like me, it is perfect! I don't know when I will return again, as I don't live anywhere close to this shop. But I am happy they are still around, and I am happy that the recipe is as consistent as it was all of those years ago."

What a disappointing experience."
445,xGLdehdsXBIiTJ8MQzJ7hA,11/7/2015,5 star rating,"Love this place. I moved into the area to attend grad school at Fordham and this has become my go-to diner. Service is fast, friendly, and the food is extremely affordable and very good. There are few (if any) places in New York City where you can get endless coffee, a plate of french toast, and a glass of orange juice for five bucks, and M&G is one of them.I also get their veggie burger often if I stop in at lunch, which is very good and unlike any I've had before-- it seems homemade, though I could be wrong.There are two locations, both on Arthur Ave. One is just south of 187th, and the other is just north of 188th. The southern location seems to be busier in my experience, and the northern location (""M&G II"") is mostly populated with younger Fordham students from the off-campus housing which is right there. I usually go to this one just because it's less crowded, though if you go on a weekend morning to either location, it doesn't even matter (super busy).Definitely the best diner in Belmont."

Well you turn down Arthur Ave and walk past all of the bakeries, and turn right into the smallest diner you will probably ever see.Even though you'll more than likely have to wait for a table (forever and a day if its the weekend), the food is excellent, and booger free everytime I visited (which was every weekend  for the past 2 years)."

It fills a nice void since Pete's closed and there are two locations within blocks, so of one is too crowded you can go to the other. Basically I would go because it's there, but not because I'm in the mood."

The restaurant had a cute interior and was not cramped. I got the Middle Eastern Breakfast which had a nice variety of salad, hummus, pita, quinoa and eggs. They let me choose the style of eggs -- I asked for poached -- and they were perfectly done with a slightly gooey center. The pita was flavorful with plenty of herbs sprinkled on top and the hummus was super good too!Although the dish sounded pretty simple, it was well executed and with quick service as well."

On a Tuesday night, our group of five was seated right away at a round table tucked in the corner. We shared several appetizers. The spicy peppers were not very spicy but came with a nice, creamy hummus. The flaky paratha was delicious. It was light and buttery. We were expecting it to be filled but the lentils and red pepper sauce were actually served on the side. The crispy cauliflower had a perfect, charred texture. For our mains, we got the vegetable couscous and lamb shank tagine. For five people, the portion sizes were a bit small to share. The vegetables in the couscous were not chopped; they were served in large pieces. A broth was served on the side. The dish was not as rich and flavorful as we were expecting. The broth added some taste, but overall the dish was a little too plain. My friends enjoyed the lamb, which was tender and fell off the bone. Our waitress was a bit curt, but service was fast. I'd come again but stick to apps next time."

The sun already moved behind the building and we still didn't get our order. Then we found out 1/2 hr later that our order was never put in. Disappointing! That's why tables seated after us got their meals. And we were paying for parking. Anyway the food arrived at least 45 min after we sat. Food is ok. Moroccan benedict was poached eggs with hollandaise with a side of potatoes and beet/green salad, difference from eggs benedict is the tomato based sauce and spicy sauce on the side - no meat. $17I liked the Tunisian sandwich but got a bit soggy to be picked up because of the tahini dressing, maybe better on the side. House-made spicy merguez sausage was missing the spice for me. $16  Got to make a little design on my coffee since they give the steamed milk on the side. At least we got our coffees comped, thanks to a nice staff member who was the one who checked in on our order. Our original waitstaff didn't even come by again. Hostess was nice."

That was one of my favorite things I had in the meal.The labne with zataar was also a stand out. Absolutely delicious and hit the spot. Creamy and spicy in just the right ways. The bread was so warm and fresh- delightfully fluffy. Fries with harissa ketchup were a delicious side. For my meal I got the Moroccan Benedict. It was good, but didn't make my mouth sing. I found it to be a little bland. When I hear the word spicy, I expect spice and this left me wanting more. I think my heart really wanted another dish but for some reason I ordered this. Interior is very cozy and bright. Has a nice airy feel to it. They even have a bar, which I didn't realize.I would still definitely come back for brunch, I can see why this place is popular! Definitely gives spring/summer vibes. Would I wait 2 hours to eat here? Probably not, but I think it's worth a 30-40 min wait! 4.4/5"

I was there visiting from the UK with my two daughters and granddaughter. the bill (cheque) came to $312 -twice the price of my local Lebanese restaurant where the food is much better-but nevertheless I rounded the bill up to $ 350. Once I had paid some smarmy woman came up and announced to the table ""was everything ok ? it's just that you left a very low tip"". The tip was twice what would be expected in Europe and was in any event not deserved. If she was really enquiring about the standard of the service she could have asked me personally discreetly.I replied that I did not appreciate someone coming to my table telling me in front of my family that I had left a low tip. An American friend has now told me that a 20% tip is what is expected as the staff are paid by their tips. Pathetic. inevitably my daughters were extremely embarrassed -not least by how much I had paid for their meals-and the whole situation was awful. The place was packed selling overpriced average food and the owners were making a fortune. If they want a tip here's one "" Pay your staff a decent living wage so that any gratuities are a bonus!"""

Me and my friend arrived at 12pm on a Saturday and it was EMPTY :) which was not a problem cause I love having a lot of space! Literally a breath of fresh air We sat indoors though they do have seating outdoors as well.I got the Noodles with Beef & Braised Sauce while my friend got the Spicy Beef & Tendon Noodles Soup. We also got the Taiwanese Luwei Braised Soybean Curd to share.I loved my dish as I was aiming for something not spicy and not needing to deal with hot soup although my friend's dish was served closer to warm than hot. The garlic sauce on top of the beef was not overwhelming and packs the flavor needed to go with the slightly cold beef slices and noodles underneath.I tasted my friend's beef and found it rather gamey compared to mine. She agreed my beef was better. For super spicy eaters, I can confirm through my friend this was not spicy at all.Another friend joined later and got the tomato beef noodle soup which I noticed was served significantly hotter. She said it was good too.They also gave a lot more soybean curd than expected which is always a plus.Would I come again? Absolutely!"

A little mala tingle afterwards from the szechuan peppers. Highly recommend this!- braised tendon: my least fav bc the tendon soaked in all the salt and it was too soft for me. I like more chew in my tendon- spicy beef, tendon, tripe noodle soup: so good! Def would reorder next time. Noodles are just the right texture and the flavor is so good.- braised beef rice: very delicious and hearty dish. My husband loved this!I will definitely be back.

You can tell the soup was cooked long and the taste is strong and flavorful. The soup base is actually above the average of Taiwanese beef noodle soup we can get in NYC.The only I dont like is the options for noodles. They only have one choice of noodles which is thin but very firm.Maybe next time I will just order the soup without the noodles lol.

Part of the experience of eating soup is wanting to eat eat but having to blow, slurp, and sip before it gets to a temperature that is some what manageable. Anyways, that's an easy fix so despite that the flavor was great and the noodles had a nice chew.

No frills, homey, affordable -- all the things I love.My boyfriend and I had dinner here after watching Shang Chi on a Saturday evening. The place was on the quieter side, with only a few other parties dining in as well. We sat comfortably by the window, and never felt rushed.For apps/sides, we ordered the assorted luwei (braised egg, braised soybean curd, braised kelp knots - $6.95), the assorted cold dish (jade cucumber, black fungus, edamame - $5.95) and 2 pork gua bao ($4.95/each). All SO good. We especially recommend the cold dish - it's the perfect sampler of Asian appetizers and will go so well with your meal. The gua bao was also perfect, no complaints there. Next time I will try the beef roll!For the main event, I got the Tomato Beef Noodle Soup ($13.95) and bf got the Braised Beef & Tendon Noodle Soup ($13.95). We both LOVED our bowls - the noodles, the beef, the broth... everything was great. We asked for a side of chili oil that we enjoyed so much that we ended up asking to buy a small cup ($5) of it to bring home. We now use it on our dumplings, eggs, etc. We'll most definitely be returning for our Taiwanese fix!"

This place was deplorable by any metric used to measure a delivery food experience. The food arrived an hour and 35 minutes after I ordered; I had to call and inquire. Of course it was stone cold when it did arrive. I could forgive that as places get busy, but the food itself was revolting. The burrito was simply awful, without question the worst I ever had. The guac was whitish-green and looked like it had mayo added to it, and the taste was even worse than the appearance. My wife wouldn't touch it and she usually eats all the guac before I can even get any. I took a picture and sent it to some friends to see if they could guess what it was supposed to be. No one guessed guacamole. I can only assume the nacho chips are purchased wholesale from a vendor, because they were pretty good. I ate the chips and threw the rest of the meal out. Overall, I hope this place is a front for some sort of shady criminal enterprise, because otherwise they're not in the right business."

A dive bar worth a quick stop, but not much more.Quality: Old-school dive bar. I ordered a few draft beers. Okay selection and served cold. Quantity: Fair pours.Value: Beers fell from around $6 to $8. Cash only.Ambiance: The Brooklyn Inn is a Brooklyn area bar that originally opened in 1885. The dark and dusty bar has all sorts of classic architectural  stylings that make it a unique place to wander around. The back area has a pool table, which was constantly busy, but the room is just too small for it. Acoustics are rough, making it tough to hear music and conversation, but hard to fault a design over a hundred years old.Crowd: A busy crowd in a tight space. On a less than beautiful day, crowds flocked to the dark and cozy spot.Service: Bartenders well accustomed to a packed room. Staff makes the rounds to clear out empty glasses.Parking: Residential area makes parking tough."

Lots of little nooks to be a little more private. The pool table is good for groups of friends. And if you're just with a pal, the bar could be your spot.

Although I don't frequent the area of Bedford-Stuy and therefore can't elaborate on the continuously changing neighborhood or compare the quality of this bar to the other bars nearby, I can say this is a nice place to have casual hangouts with friends. Throughout the hour, the bartenders continuously checked up on my group to ask if everything is going well and whether or not we needed refills. Its incredibly welcoming vibes and the great hospitality provided by the bartenders made this a lovely evening. There were plenty of seats for the number of people there. I did find that at times the music got a bit loud making it difficult to hear what your friend, who is sitting next to you, is saying unless you speak a bit louder.

I think this is a cute bar for meeting up that is finding its legs in the community. They will need to figure out what their thing is. Like for instance the other local hipster bar (who shall not be named here) has cookies at midnight every night so you know that you can get tipsy and have a snack and go home. So what their 'thing' will be is yet to be seen. It is a cute place though with great service, comfy environment, fanny packs (dear God why are these a thing) and a wicked mullet."

It's very much in the same aesthetic as Do or Dive and a couple others bars with the same owner group as I was informed.  I immediately got that vibe when I walked in and the bartender confirmed that.  She was cool to chat with and inviting. I had passed this place before and popped in later one evening but didn't care too much for the vibe or lack there of, however, when I finally committed to coming in and staying to have drinks I still didn't care for the lack of vibe or the music but the drink prices keep you content.  It's not unlikely that I wouldn't stop back in."

My partner is vegetarian and love this place as well. They even have some vegan option. I usually come with him or by myself. But decided to check in on yelp today and write a review. I tried other coffee shops in the neighborhood and this is so far the one I like the most. COFFEE: 5 stars. One of the owner has a pop-up coffee business and surely does knows good quality coffee. And I'm Italian, so you know we are picky with our espresso and cappuccino. FOOD: 5 stars. The other owner worked in the food business for a while and really knows her food and always has great recommendation. They choose nice ingredients. They make the Avocado Cream fresh every time for their Avocado Toast. And their Overnight Oats is sooo goodSERVICE: 5 stars. I always see them SMILING and be welcoming. You are supposed to order at the counter, but they often bring your food and drinks at the table. DECOR: 5 stars. It's nice and simple decor with lots of lovely plants and the place is always clean. Hey they got an A from inspection on the window! So you know they are great."

Aside from great food, you also get a cozy ambiance where as soon as you step in, you feel as if you're walking into a family member's kitchen (one that you like). My usual order has been the Red onion, tomato and jalapeño avo toast with a peach black iced tea. The team at CM accommodates my onion allergy and prepares it without the red onions but they manage to make sure the flavor profile is still there! All of the toasts offer the option to add an egg if you're looking to add a little protein. For the new year, they've added some of the tastiest vegan foods I've ever enjoyed. I've had the bahn mi, chopped cheese and the BLT... and let me tell you, if all of  my vegan meals were as good as this, I wouldn't even look at seafood again! The price point is pretty on par with the area, checking out at around $11 for an iced tea and avo toast. Keep up the amazing work Cafe Moca!"

I instantly called the number on my receipt, to my surprise, they did NOT answer. I spent $71.00 in that place, just to get robbed, out of my food. (Missing Lrg Mac n Cheese + Four Fried Chicken Legs). Now here the Kicker.., when I went there the nxt day, remind you I live in Queens, gas is still high, they had the audacity to tell me, they didn't work last night, so I have to wait to nxt Friday to comeback there and complain to the workers that worked on Friday.. SMH. I'll Never spend my money in that place ever Again.. and suggest others to eat at aBetter, more Professional Resturant in a better location.

I for example, placed an order through door dash to pick up myself and after the kitchen staff checked the names on the existing bags was told they didn't see my name. After waiting 15 minutes the lady at the register confirms seeing my name in her order list, the kitchen staff checks the bags again and it's magically there.And the apology didn't match the incident. Take your chances"
514,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,12/30/2020,5 star rating,"One of the best fried fish, if not the best fried pieces of whiting I've ever had. Their batter is light in color and depth but maintains a thorough and even coating with a chew and a crunch! Had I been under a rock because chewy n crunchy usually don't go together but it does here, and so perfectly too. Just a smidge salted the flaky fish is juicy but I'll tell u- it's all about that breading. It's incredible even after a 30 minute bus ride and I had to stop myself from eating the entire 4 pieces to save some for him to try. The collards were super flavorful and a hair on the sweet side- but I've never met a collard I did not like. They are cooked down with smoked Turkey, as they should be. The Mac is the absolute cheesiest and you can discern that from looking through the buffet glass, with the pasta still having bite but really really cheddary strong. It seems to me that BSFF is out to make a big bold statement in flavor town but what the hell do I know? If the constant swinging door didn't tell me, the 2 signs on the door that said ""no mask- no service"" and ""6 FT distance line"" told me they don't play, and people already know about this place."

I ordered the Polpette for appetizers, Pappardelle for entrée, and finished with a Chocolate Budino. The entrée really stood out to me as the short ribs in it had an unexpected but welcomed flavor to it. The Pappardelle tasted super fresh and paired well with the meat. Service really stood out; they meticulously explained the menu and would always ensure that we were satisfied with our dishes. The restaurant also had a nice ambience; there was a bar area in the front and then a spacious dining room adorned with various paintings and décor.I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a slightly more upscale Italian place with excellent service. I look forward to coming back here and trying the other dishes!"

We booked a reservation the night before the NY Marathon as a nice carb load dinner and definitely we're not disappointed. The weather was fairly mild that weekend, so we booked a table outside. Their outdoor seating is really intimate and surprisingly quiet despite being right on the street. I could see it being comfortable even in cooler weather as they had ample heating lamps set out. Food wise, we started with the burrata, which was simply delicious. I didn't even snag a photo of it because it was that good. The crostini served alongside was perfect. For our mains, I ordered the tagliatelle alla ragù, which was a lot more pasta than it initially appeared. SO good. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the meal itself very filling. Not pictured: my husband ordered a ravioli with pistachio that was named a special for the evening. I had a bite and I truly can't put into words how good it was. The pistachio sauce was delicate and incredibly flavorful. Had I not been running the next day, I would've loved a plate for myself! The prices were up there, but no more than anywhere else in the city, in my opinion. Service here was top notch. We were never without full glasses of our beverages, our food came out in a timely manner, and everyone we interacted with was pleasant and accommodating. I'd definitely come back, especially for a date night. I'd love to try some of their wine selection as it looked fairly extensive! Definitely don't overlook this spot!"

Granted everyone in the entire restaurant was frozen in shock but still. He wasn't breathing for almost 2 minutes. One of us ended up trying out the maneuver ourselves and it worked, thank God. It was the scariest thing I've ever experienced. Restauranteurs please have someone on every shift that knows CPR and the Heimlich it could save a life.

526,pTv4RDll3N_CGG3BwtEctg,6/25/2022,4 star rating,"Hosted a 90-person private event here recently and had a great experience. The events team was really flexible and patient with my many requests in the couple weeks before the event, and always responded quickly. They also crafted a customized menu to accommodate for specialized diet needs in the attendee group. I requested slightly elaborate place settings with favors and the staff set it up beautifully. The food was very good and the mixed drinks were strong. When I accidentally dropped all my tented place cards and they fell out of table order within seconds of the event starting, the  team helped me gather and re-order them so that we could get attendees in as quickly as possible. The private event space is in a basement (which is common in NYC) so there are no windows... but there's a lovely green living plant wall which is a nice touch. We needed a microphone for speeches and it kept cutting out, but they worked to fix it quickly. The open wifi wouldn't connect, so I wasn't able to stream my playlist... though the restaurant's music was just fine in the end! The space holds about 100 people, but I think 80 would be the ideal number. Overall it was a pleasure to plan this event with the Gran Morsi team and I'd definitely consider bringing another group back here. The event team was honestly awesome."

Listen, I don't care if the pope blessed this pasta, what I had last night was a travesty, and an expensive one I must point out. The night started out strong, we were shown to a nice table. I ordered a fabulous Super Tuscan and started with the baby beets as well as a incredible pizza topped with zucchini flowers. The pizza had the right amount of heat to it and the crust was also top notch. A Roman style, thin yet crunchy. It was a great way to start the evening. The dining area, unpretentious and welcoming. The nice bar area was inviting, if I lived in the area I'd be dining here often, trying their amazing wines and pizzas.What was lost in the sauce was our entrees. What the HELL man? I ordered the Bolognese and what was served to me was a gloppy mess of a dish. Maybe the dish sat under the warmer too long? I'm the customer, I shouldn't have to figure out what went wrong. The sauce was under seasoned and could have used some heat that I had on the pizza. Brother can you spare some red pepper flakes on my bolognese? My wife's Branzino, the picture looks great! The skin wasn't crispy and the fish also needed seasoning. Our waitress, who was great, asked if I wanted to have my remaining pasta wrapped up? I'm good I told her, thanks.I'm glad everyone wrote they had a wonderful meal at Gran Morsi. I was looking for the same five star experience, unfortunately what started out strong ended in mediocrity."

We were seated immediately next to this beautiful plant walk (also shoutout to growing a live plant wall in nyc, that is not easy!) We got the prosciutto and fig pizza, the cacio Pepe, and this new scallion and onion pizza. The scallion pizza tasted like a French onion soup in pizza form and I absolutely loved it. The cacio Pepe was so good and light. We also had the egg white cocktails and we reordered many times.Definitely a must try spot in Tribeca!"
529,pTv4RDll3N_CGG3BwtEctg,9/8/2022,2 star rating,"Two and a half stars. Unfortunately being Italian I have high hopes for good simple Italian cuisine, especially fromNew York City. We ordered a few appetizers consisting of fried calamari and arancini. Then we moved on to chicken Marsala and fettuccine bolognesi. My honest opinion is that the appetizers were far better than the actual meal itself. The calamari were tender and fried well without a lot of batter. The arancini were pretty tasty just maybe a little bit too mushy but still tasty. Unfortunately that leaves me to the fettuccine which were under cooked. The bolognese was delicious but if you cannot cook your freshly cooked pasta your entire hard work for that dish goes down the tube. The pasta was so underdone and sticking to the rest of the noodles and having pieces of hardness within each bite. I just ate half then wasn't able to continue. The chicken Marsala was nothing of what I expected. The chicken can 0 salt and flavor and there wasn't that Marsala taste. Pretty bad and fortunately the person was hungry to eat it. They don't have sides so we ordered mushrooms and potatoes which were better than the meal itself. No dessert was ordered after that because the price is high for what you get and didn't want to make a mistake with dessert. I think next time, a drink and appetizers for sure and/or sides as a main meal!!"

And I DUG through the salad to look for the chicken. I also asked for EXTRA cilantro and they gave me none?? And to top it off I got a lettuce end ‍ they didn't even try to hide it.

Well today I can officially confirm it wasn't a one time thing.she its truly a joy to interact with. I hope more business have more employees like her. BK great addition to your team A+!!!"

I am referring to the ssandwiches & the  fries which I would think ould be the easiest thing.  But not at this location...I have gotten the worst French Fries...either they are hard and over cooked on just hard and cold like they have been seating there for hours?!?!?  Same things for the burgers what happend to be FLAME BROILED!!!!

Yes better then wendys and mcdonalds. The wendys in this area sucks. Dry skimpy burgers, same goes to mcds. I like the variety of sandwiches bk has. The burgers are awesome. Go during rush hour when they are constantly make hot and fresh burgers and fries. My mom who hardly eats out even complimented on how good their fries tasted. The only complain is that the drivethru needs to be revamped, its very small and you can easily bump up your car after you leave the window, so be careful."

Called at 6:10 AM asked for delivery by seven, was promised 45 minutes. At 7:10 AM called and asked where delivery person was, told he was leaving now. This business is less than a mile away from me. I go downstairs to wait and the delivery person shows up at 7:20 and apologizes-- it's not his fault that the people that don't know how to do their work at the store couldn't hire another delivery person. Checked bags when I got upstairs both sets of English muffins are missing. Call store and guy says he has them in another bag and will send them. I say forget it. So if you want to go eat there go ahead they can't screw that up, foods pretty good, but don't try to get delivery."

WHAT!!?? when i explained how long we were waiting she said she was backed up (which would have been understandable and forgiven IF i received a courtesy call or an apology.

606,HzmjJ1mM0WdOHbfYm5mxqw,4/14/2016,1 star rating,"Its a shame i have to give this place such a low rating. The food is above average, the cooks and waitress are friendly and quick. The major problem is the owner or manager an older man that is usually looking lost.on friday 4/8/16. I order the usual egg white, onion, mushroom, TURKEY BACON wrap with avocado for an extra $1.00 and a bran muffin. Total should have been 6.00 for the wrap and bran muffin is 200. For a total of 8.00 with tax 925. He tried to charge 14.00!! I respectfully told him thats wrong and he said the turkey bacon is extra. I clearly said turkey bacon. So after a brief back and forth he finally turned around and see that i was right. He charges me right and thats that.On monday 4/11/16 i walk in thinking the issue last friday was resolved and the first thing he tells me "" hey i charged you right the first time!"" Because i didnt charge you for the avocado. Now i explain to him that he did charge me because the wrap is usually 495 extras are $1 as per the huge sign that was behind him. Do that makes it $600 plud $2 for the muffin. He says no thats wrong and i leave alone. Now the prices are cheap enough why would i try to scam him on $1?? My advice to anyone that goes there is to make sure you know the price and count your change. Other than that the food is good."
607,HzmjJ1mM0WdOHbfYm5mxqw,5/29/2018,1 star rating,I despise this place because they can't do anything correctly. First time I ordered they got my order completely wrong.

The first thing I see coming out of the kitchen is a steaming stack of fresh naan as tall as I am. I think I paid about five dollars for enough food (saag, lamb curry, rice, raita, et al) to feed me for three days. Very tasty and cheap.And dessert! The counter guy had serious opinions about what I should get and actually wouldn't serve me some of the stuff (?) ""no, not that one."" whatever you say, guy. this place rules."

613,MHbxF-ZS918-ZoXKQPBEyg,2/16/2009,4 star rating,"Inexpensive Pakistani fare. Get their biryani, naan, kebabs, kheer, and the okra if it's on the menu that day. The kheer (rice pudding), is crazy good. It's thick and creamy with no cardamom seeds and thick pieces of cinnamon mixed in and it's only for about $2 a box. The naan sandwich, which is a huge naan bread wrapped around chicken kebabs and salad with raita is the biggest sandwich you'll ever eat for just $2."

616,MHbxF-ZS918-ZoXKQPBEyg,3/15/2013,5 star rating,I think they have the best tasting curry and an Naan. They are fairly inexpensive so your wallet wont go dry and their curries are amazing. Also try their Chicken tandoori. I would definitely recommend everyone to come try their food. and ahhh yess dont forget about the rice pudding... its definitely AMAZING.
617,MHbxF-ZS918-ZoXKQPBEyg,8/6/2012,4 star rating,"Basic and cheap Pakistani steam table food, with a little bit of variation depending on the time of day. It's extremely oily, and spicier than the Indian Curry In a Hurry-type equivalent. The samosas, pakoras, and kebabs are all cold and have to be microwaved, as far as I can tell.Mashallah, the place a couple of doors further up, is supposed to be similar except that everything is very liberally spiced (""hot"" or ""extra hot"" to this place's ""medium""). It does look like they might have a better selection of fried food, too."

The person at the counter ignore me and was taking care of white people first on top of everything I'm paying for my service and because I asked for something extra he seemed to be in a bad mood I will not come back to this place!

I also love the fact that (as far as I know) the juice has no added sugar. Not only that, but I'm in love with the overall aesthetic. The plants, pillows, and music make it a perfect place to come to chat or just to relax."
626,f9xQH4lNAlU9yUYtFPm7sg,12/25/2018,4 star rating,I try to come here fairly often because it's tasty and healthy. I love their juices and smoothies..But I ordered an açaí bowl one time and most places will ask you if you want anything in it because the offerings weren't written anywhere.. this girl didn't ask me and I literally got a mehhhhh bowl of açaí waste of money.Also their portions of toast on grubhub and pictures provided by business owner show bigger then what you get sort of frustrating cause you are expecting something and something else.They also need to work on staff training yesterday I was watching two girls making drinks and it honestly felt like forever because they had no communication and one girl messed it up. It's also weird to see owner or manager walking around looking miserable ekk.3.5-4 stars but they need to put in work

They don't know how to make açaí, they blend so much banana with the açaí pulp making it a gooey consistency it is inedible, unfortunately I had to throw it all in the garbage. This is how to prepare an açaí bowl: 8 oz frozen açaí pulp cut into chunks1/4 cup chilled water or 1/4 almond milk 1/3 cup guaraná syrup or honey1/3 cup crushed ice(1/2 of a small banana - Optional) not 30 bananas! Banana, strawberry, granola... whatever you'd like to serve on TOP! Thank you anyway guys! If you want a great açaí bowl go to Juice Generation they rock!"

Pretty sure one of the most essential parts of a smoothie is the ICE!?! It was like a vomit smoothie. That's exactly what it was. Imagine someone chewing up all the fruit and then spitting it back in the cup and then giving it to you. We paid 8 bucks for fruit vomit. No, they did not run out of ice. There was plenty of ice sitting around and ice chilling their fruit cups. My friend couldn't even drink her order. She threw hers in the trash can as I struggled to drink mine. Gagged at every sip until I just gave up too. One star because the fruit here looks fresh at least. Try anything but the smoothie. Seriously. Or tell them to put some freaking ice in the smoothie. Ice is like the essence of a smoothie is it not....??"

I'm a sucker for good soup, and during the winter, they have it. Stands to reason that people drink a lot less juice/smoothies when it's cold out, so I understand the decision.What I don't understand is why the soup is A. expensive and B. boring The combination is a bad one. I'm going to hazard a guess and say that they don't make it in house. Granted with the juices they do, and that's great, but the soup has the blandness of a bag that's been in a fridge for awhile. Very disappointing.The people are nice, the place smells really good, I appreciate independent vendors in a part of town where there keep being less and less of them, but I really can't recommend this place to anybody for their soup."

641,qpD22cY8CSXLT2qujiJtqw,12/18/2019,5 star rating,The space is quite beautiful.  Even the restroom was impressive.  The place had just opened so I don't think a lot of people know of it yet.  My friend and I got there at eleven and it was nice and quiet.  Many places to try.   Not all was quite open at that moment.  One place would open in fifteen minutes.  I tried the Afghan place. Had a potato rice dish. It was good but would try something different next time. Friend liked the soup there

However I tried Papa Poulie  and  for 16 dollars I could have gone to the bodega and had a better sandwich. My pita was cold and hard , chicken was bland the entire sandwich was sad and definitely not worth again the 16$. I get it's new and they need to settle in but that does not excuse poor  execution and charge that much.  Hopefully the other vendors are getting right ....."
643,qpD22cY8CSXLT2qujiJtqw,12/18/2019,5 star rating,"One of the great things about The Deco is you are supporting local businesses, not chains or establishments with, like, +20 locations. Don't get me wrong, I love my Dig Inn et al, but this is definitely more of a unique place than, say, Urban Space. Definitely designed for a nice social experience that feels more intimate than some of your other food halls in the city that can get really loud and dense."
644,qpD22cY8CSXLT2qujiJtqw,1/23/2020,5 star rating,Beautiful space! So glad to have a spot in midtown. We ordered from Antojitos Caseros. Wow! Ordered the al pastor. This place was hands down the best Mexican food I've had in Manhattan. Believe the hype. Can't wait to head back and try more. It's on a side street so wasn't too busy and if I didn't mention already the space itself is gorgeous and super comfortable. If I worked regularly in the area I I'd be here twice a day!!
645,BYOxFf1eg66kWDK8KOvNeQ,2/28/2023,5 star rating,"Great Thai place so it's no wonder why it's always so busy. There were people waiting outside on a Saturday Monday before they even opened!Pad Thai ($22) - with fried chicken. The fried chicken was properly fried so it was quite crispy. It's only a one dollar difference with regular chicken so it's very worth it. The noodles had great flavor - they were also tossed with small dried fish, which gave the dish more umami and texture. Service was great and the interior was decked out with Thai things. It certainly mixed the idea of a diner with Thai quite well. The menu is also quite extensive, with a blend of American and Thai inspired foods."
646,BYOxFf1eg66kWDK8KOvNeQ,2/9/2023,5 star rating,"Some of the best Thai food I've had. Came here on a Saturday around 11:45 and there was a 20 minute wait. When we left, there was a much longer line, so I would encourage you to either get a reservation or come earlier. We got the following for the four of us:Thai Tea Babka French toast: this was delicious. It had a Thai tea butter, condensed milk, and dragon fruit on top of a  rich babka that came in four pieces. Laab with fried chicken: you have the choice of also getting mushrooms or minced pork, but I think fried chicken is the right call. The dressing had a slightly sour/spicy taste which was interesting and it also came with sticky rice. This was my favorite dish. Kaeng Kieow Waan: this was a duck leg with  rice noodles and a green curry sauce that wasn't too spicy. My friends all loved this one. Crab fried rice: good dish to have as a side. They included a spicy sauce on the side if you want to up the ante, but the rice also has enough flavor on its own. Ice cream sundae: this popped up as one of the best desserts in New York according to the Infatuation, and though it was good, I don't see how this would be any different from other sundaes. There was a ton of whipped cream on top (more so than the coconut gelato) and it came with candied peanuts and toasted coconut. Indoor and enclosed outdoor seating available. Two single occupant restrooms available inside. Up to two credit cards accepted per table."
647,BYOxFf1eg66kWDK8KOvNeQ,3/10/2023,5 star rating,This place let me charge my dead phone I was so grateful. Ambiance was lovely. We sat the one of the window tables where it was bright but when you go to the inner seats the lighting is dimmed out with louder music. The toast with Thai butter was so savory. Phat see ew was a little different from other places where it was slightly bitter from the vegetables. The burger had a lot going on. I could taste fish sauce and the burger itself was unique but too greasy for my liking. The shots were strong!

Managed to snag a lunch reservation at 11:45am via tock.When I got there, the restaurant was approx. 1/4 full. There were two of us and they sat us in a booth which was really nice. I ordered from their breakfast menu as they were items you would not normally dine elsewhere. The French toast was pretty epic. I've never had anything like it before. The eggs wrapped in roti was pretty nice too, goes well with the sauce.Would definitely come back here again and try out their fried chicken and crab fried rice as it looked pretty nice. I left around 1:30pm and the restaurant was half full, bearing in mind I came on a weekday."
649,BYOxFf1eg66kWDK8KOvNeQ,2/21/2023,4 star rating,"Finally made it to Thai diner for brunch and it lived up to expectations! The star of the show was definitely the Thai iced tea French toast - super unique and you can definitely taste the namesake inspiration. Little balls of dragonfruit were a nice garnish. Great to share!We also got the khao soi, which was super flavorful and came with great chewy noodles and a chili sauce that gives it all a spicy kick! The cabbage rolls (another of their signatures) I was a bit less impressed with, but maybe I'm just not a fan of the minced/ground meat. I also didn't realize there was a dipping sauce until I'd already finished my roll, so maybe that contributed to my impression of this dish.We got the lychee mousse for dessert - would pass on this one. It was a bit too oddly sour in my opinion (maybe yogurt-based/infused?). Would love to come back and try those disco fries and the curry. Super small tables but a great space (looks like it has a nice bar counter for solo diners too! Worth flagging!). We arrived right as they opened on a holiday Monday and were able to walk in with no issues. Would recommend a res otherwise though."
650,BYOxFf1eg66kWDK8KOvNeQ,3/29/2023,5 star rating,Came here for dinner before but decided to come for brunch today. Definitely worth a try and i recommend the french toast over the egg sandwich. I personally dont enjoy too much pepper in eggs so didnt really enjoy the sandwich.Coming on a weekday morning is definitely a good idea since it was really hectic last time when i came for dinner. They have occasional reservations open online. The service is detail orientated and fast.

I didn't really see my usuals like Thai basil fried rice or drinker noodles. So I decided to try the Khao soi and I was happy with my choice. The chicke is cooked so well and so soft that you can break it apart with a spoon. The curry is a a coconut curry that is really flavorful! I like the mix of dry and non- dry noodles! A great meal for a cold day. Next time I will come for the pad see -ew because that looked deliciousAmbience: I liked the place. However, the tables for 4 people are very snug! It was very tight for all us to sit where we were. They have heat lamps and it was really hot when right under thereService: good service! They didn't rush us to get up after we were done whixh I really appreciatedPrices: reasonable and in line with other Thai restaurants"
652,BYOxFf1eg66kWDK8KOvNeQ,1/13/2023,5 star rating,"Amazing food. Ive never had authentic Thai food like this, the quality was great you can tell right off the bat. The laab and khaki soi are also vegetarian friendly which is great (replaced with mushrooms). The drinks were very tasty and made well. I really liked the fries, they were drenched in a spicy massaman curry flavor which was great. Service was great, very friendly waiters. Ambiance - unfortunately we didn't get to sit inside which looked beautiful but the outside patio was completely covered and heated and also had music blasting so it wasn't that bad"

This place has been on my list for so long, I'm glad I finally went!We ordered:Thai Diner Egg Sandwich $14Pad Thai w/ chicken $20Thai Ice Tea $4Prices were very reasonable! The Thai sandwich had egg, sausage and veggies inside with some kind of scallion mayo aioli. It also came with a dipping sauce that was a little too salty for my liking but went well with the sausage if used sparingly. The Thai tea was decent and not overly sweet! Food came out pretty fast but it was hard to flag down a waiter for anything. My friend had to get up and go up to the counter to get their attention. Overall, would come again as their menu has so many interesting options!"

When I stepped up to the register to order, the woman at the register sucked her teeth and gave a sigh and said they were all out of Everything Bagels. Meanwhile, there was an abundance of Everything Bagels on the rack to the left of the register. This woman obviously hates her job and didn't even bother to check to see if there were any bagels left. I settled for the basic regular bagel instead. Only reason why I come here on a regular basis is because I work around the corner. Otherwise, I would've stayed away. There's always Pax down the block."

Even though things are premade everything I've had has been fresh and makes for a quick check out.For breakfast I love the southwest breakfast wrap (with the addition of Franks Red Hot) and a new discovery of egg salad and bacon on baguette which was delicious and travels well as it's not hot. I haven't had a bad lunch and like many of the sandwiches but lately have been trying to behave and find the salmon/quinoa/edamame salad and the coconut chicken/miso sweet potato box. Both have a great combo of textures and flavors and don't make me want to nap after eating. My only gripe is this location has limited seating and is often packed, eating standing is no fun. It can also get expensive if you add juice or sides, luckily I can expense my $15 breakfast but I would think twice about the cost if I was at home and footing the bill."
664,oBcuOhubYwHV_bY35lu5hA,1/29/2014,3 star rating,I like Pret - their food is fast and easy and is generally healthy.

666,K6x7wyqA2iOBjWIhMvOBVQ,10/7/2018,2 star rating,"Eh...Their display case of sandwiches was pretty picked over, lots of empty areas. I selected a sandwich, $8.50 (with tax) seemed a little high for a pre-made boxed sandwich, but whatever. The sandwich was decent, nothing remarkable. But in the end, not really worth the price. The service was underwhelming. There was one person behind the counter. She was preparing a coffee for someone else and tried to ring me up as she was still making the coffee. She told me my total and immediately turned around to keep making coffee. I paid with my card and the machine said ""approved,"" which my only indication the transaction was complete. The cashier never acknowledged my payment, or asked if I wanted a receipt. While I appreciate she was trying to keep the line moving, some sort of offer for a receipt, or even a ""thank you"" as she turned back to make coffee would have been appreciated.My only other experience with Pret was in the UK. So I had some expectations based on my excellent experiences there. Maybe it was too much. But this Pret was way below expectations."

At one location, they would even save a Swedish Meatball sub for me in back (they flew off the shelves at lunch like mad), but I digress.This is the only Pret in the states where I felt (almost) right at home. I didn't try the New York Meatball sub for fear of it not living up to my British-trained tastebuds' expectations, but everything else I tried was fabulous.I've tasted their miso soup, salmon and quinoa pot, wild salmon salad, a blueberry muffin, pain au chocolat, cappuccino, oatmeal, and several fruit cups. In one word: YUM.The only thing disappointing was the cappuccino, but I remember them being less than stellar across the pond, too. It just tasted bland and more latte-ish; a cappuccino should still have some kick.This place is busy and gets pretty dirty -- they'd have to be hovering over the tables to clean them as frequently as is necessary -- but it's well worth popping into just go grab something good for your belly and your soul. :)Freshly-made every day + all remnants are donated.

When I worked in midtown, I came to this location almost every day for a coffee and croissant. The staff does try to be friendly (their motto), but most of the time they are talking and laughing with each other and the line to the registers is getting longer and longer. The employees at this Pret need to be more organized. This is a busy location so lots of people are in and out during the day. At lunch it's almost impossible to get a table. I've noticed that when I do happen to find one, the tables are not always clean and some of the staff is standing around and chatting. A good option here is to get take out and just eat at the office."

Meanwhile, there was an abundance of Everything Bagels on the rack to the left of the register. This woman obviously hates her job and didn't even bother to check to see if there were any bagels left. I settled for the basic regular bagel instead.

Even though things are premade everything I've had has been fresh and makes for a quick check out.For breakfast I love the southwest breakfast wrap (with the addition of Franks Red Hot) and a new discovery of egg salad and bacon on baguette which was delicious and travels well as it's not hot. I haven't had a bad lunch and like many of the sandwiches but lately have been trying to behave and find the salmon/quinoa/edamame salad and the coconut chicken/miso sweet potato box. Both have a great combo of textures and flavors and don't make me want to nap after eating. My only gripe is this location has limited seating and is often packed, eating standing is no fun. It can also get expensive if you add juice or sides, luckily I can expense my $15 breakfast but I would think twice about the cost if I was at home and footing the bill."

Lol Nice seating area by the window if you are looking to get some work done, meet with someone casually or simple people watch while you sip on your coffee or enjoy one of their sandwiches."

Even though things are premade everything I've had has been fresh and makes for a quick check out.For breakfast I love the southwest breakfast wrap (with the addition of Franks Red Hot) and a new discovery of egg salad and bacon on baguette which was delicious and travels well as it's not hot. I haven't had a bad lunch and like many of the sandwiches but lately have been trying to behave and find the salmon/quinoa/edamame salad and the coconut chicken/miso sweet potato box. Both have a great combo of textures and flavors and don't make me want to nap after eating. My only gripe is this location has limited seating and is often packed, eating standing is no fun. It can also get expensive if you add juice or sides, luckily I can expense my $15 breakfast but I would think twice about the cost if I was at home and footing the bill."

Traveling to places like Hong Kong and China where the wok is a very popular cooking tool for a lot of things I believe the chief  may be from the main land from the taste of the food. They don't speak much English but they're able to take your order if you point at the menu.

The inside of the restaurant isn't big but it's enough to fit large groups. I would say..there was about ten tables there. Food:Cilantro, Tofu & Pork Soup - DELICIOUS! Came in a big bowl that serves about ten people. I'm a cilantro lover so when I tasted the soup, I was in LOVE. Soup was aromatic and each spoonful had the cilantro flavor in it. The pork and tofu is just as good. The soup had a mild flavor of pork and the texture of soft tofu was just awesome.Chicken & Corn Soup - My sister on the other hand, HATES cilantro. So we ordered another soup for the family to share. I had a bowl of this also since I love corn as well. This also came in a big bowl enough to share with ten people. This restaurant is not cheap with their ingredients because each bowl had chunks and chunks of chicken meat and corn AND egg! YUM!Bacon Fried Rice - When I asked the waiter what kind of fried rice dishes they had, she recommend the bacon fried rice. When I heard BACON, I knew I had to order it. It came in a plate that was enough to feed about seven people. The way they cooked it was fantastic. I've tried many chinese restaurants before and their fried rice is nothing compared to this one. The way the egg was cooked made it look like strands and strands of noodles. There was a decent amount of bacon which made it THAT much more enjoyable. This is a must have!Roasted Garlic Chicken - As you may have heard, chinese people usually believes that eating chicken will bring you good luck and fortune. My mother would ALWAYS order a chicken dish every time we go to any restaurants. We ordered a whole chicken. The chefs cut each piece nicely and neatly which showed that they cared for the presentation of the food. The flavor of the chicken was awesome! There were bits of fried garlic all over the chicken, giving it the garlic flavor. They put a decent amount of soy sauce, just enough to coat the chicken but not too much that the skin is still crispy.Cantonese Style Lobster over Noodles - Stir-fried lobster over a bed of egg noodles. This dish was pretty good, I was actually a fan of the noodles more than the lobster.Steamed Shrimp - This is usually a starter at restaurants. This is enough to feed ten people. Basically just steamed shrimp (with shell) and they provide a sweet/salty soy sauce for you to dip the shrimp in. Its a simple dish but the soy sauce makes it yummy!Oxtail Casserole - This order was a bit unique for me. Not usually a fan of oxtail but this came in a little casserole, braised oxtail with bean curd skin in a delicious brown sauce. I would order this again.Black Bean Clams - one word, DELICIOUS. Must have! Overall, this restaurant was better than average! I would definitely recommend this restaurant and since I live around the area..I will definitely visit again!"

Though the food was good, the dishes being served to the Chinese patrons around us looked more interesting and complex then the dishes on the English menu.

However, as often as I enjoy heading across the East River to enjoy some of that Mediterranean fare, sometimes I just want some chicken covered in tzatziki sauce without having to venture far from home. Since I discovered this place in the neighborhood, I have not been able to stop coming back.Protein-wise, I always go with the chicken or yeero (gyro) and am not let down. Where this place shines though, in my opinion, are the sides. As a fan of bean protein, the gigante beans, lentil salad, and chickpea salad are all big wins in my book. For something lighter, I might go with the Greek salad or beet salad. Then to top it all off, you can get a topping of hummus, eggplant, garlic, feta, or the classic tzatziki. If I could get all five I would.Look, it's hard to find good Greek food in Manhattan at an affordable price. If you happen to be in Murray Hill, look no further than EONS to get your fix."

I love the Tibetan altar they have there to honor their culture, and it's such a nice change to see people working in a restaurant who are happy and relaxed. That matters.I do agree with some of the other reviews and would like to share a few possible points for improvement:The baked goods always have that gritty / dry texture. While the food tastes healthy and fresh, it IS quite expensive. $6 to add tempeh to a salad is surprising, for example.

Also they were speaking in Turkish and laughing in my face while looking at me so I know for a fact they were talking about me. They could've just told me my order was ready didn't have to be so rude about it. The falafel wrap was extremely bland, and they offered me an extremely bland and watery tahin sauce.

You get a pretty generous portion for what you pay.We ordered the gyro and also falafel platter.  Both were excellent.  The rice is on point and the salad is fresh.My only wish was if you get fries, they just pile the meat on top of them, and this leads to some soggy fries.  I think they should just have them on the side if possible.I'll be back."
808,Kh0-HmlgmVUkRxR55_Vn1g,11/17/2021,2 star rating,"Not a great option if you're anywhere near a street cart (ie all of NYC). Their large plate is grossly overpriced at 17 dollars. The size is maybe 10% bigger than a platter from any street vendor. I wouldn't mind paying the price, but the actual quality and taste is not great.Their plate comes with a small amount of meat. Meat quality was very good, I had the lamb. However the rice, which is more than 80% of the dish, was just plain white rice. No flavors, no spices, nothing. It ass dry and bland and does an extreme disservice to the good meat. Honestly dokt understand how they justify the price becusse the rice is dirt cheap and has nothing at all done to it. To top it off they only give a small contianer of their yogurt. Extra is 50 cents! You are way better off getting a wrap, or better yet just going to a street cart. Better flavor, better sauce,and way more food for the price. Thankfully there is one right down the street."

813,Kh0-HmlgmVUkRxR55_Vn1g,1/9/2021,5 star rating,"Istanbul Bay is a casual Turkish & Mediterranean spot at the corner of 42nd and 9th. It is a new and welcomed addition to the neighborhood and an delicious and affordable meal.The restaurant is very small - standing room only with a couple of bar stools. The menu offers an array of salads, apps, salad, rice plates and sandwiches and wraps. The guys behind the counter are friendly and passionate about their food. I ordered the doner (lamb gyro plate), mix doner (lamb+chicken gyro plate), and a side of falafel (not on the menu). The plates come with bread, rice, and salad. They kindly threw in a container of what I think is keskul (milk pudding with almonds + pistachio) for me to try.The plates were generously portioned. I think we got more meat than we did rice! Definitely had to split it into 2 meals. The thin slices of meat were moist, tasty and flavorful. Salt level was balanced. Salad was refreshing, though a bit heavy on the parsley for my taste. I could do without the bread.  Istanbul Bay's falafel is solid - crispy on the outside, soft and flavor-packed on the inside. They are on the larger size too. A side order of these guys isn't on the menu, but you can just ask. The keskul was the perfect dessert. Great smooth texture, delicate milk flavor and lightly sweetened.   It's not listed on their menu but you can grab it from the drink case. I'm excited that Istanbul Bay has opened up, especially when many businesses here have closed during the pandemic. I look forward to many future meals from here."

I ask if I can replace it with something else he told me no I asked for a manager he said there's no manager and I would have to place my complaint online and good luck with that and he mumbled something under his breath but the way I look I will never go back to that place ever again.

819,Kh0-HmlgmVUkRxR55_Vn1g,7/27/2018,2 star rating,"This was my first visit and I was less than impressed by the lack of customer service when I first entered. The young lady who took my order had zero personality and offered no ""hello"" or ""can I take your order,"" even after I started with ""hi, how are you doing?"" She just stared at me as if I was wasting her time. She spoke very low, made no eye contact and mumbled. I'm not sure if it was a cultural thing or she just had no people skills. Anyway, I ordered the #1 combo (cheeseburger w/fries and a soda). I really enjoyed the cheeseburger, it reminded me of the whopper. The fries were cheap in my opinion they were on par with a Kennedy Fried Chicken but nowhere near McDonald's fries. They don't offer fountain soda, they just give you a can. The can of soda I was given was room temperature and I was forced to buy another drink because I took my order to go. I'm not sure if I'll try this again because I left with a bad feeling after my first visit here. In situations like this I don't blame the employees because they're typically teenagers, I blame management for allowing that type of conduct to flourish"

825,zuxZtAredHPR1wrx12g1ng,10/30/2017,1 star rating,The chicken is way overpriced and the Burgers are over cooked. I was really disappointed with this place.
826,zuxZtAredHPR1wrx12g1ng,5/24/2019,1 star rating,The worse service I ever got never going back there again and I was a long time customer I started to go there when they first open up. 5/21 I went to place my order they had ran out of what I was asking for then the worker who was taking my order was making remarks about me that I like chicken a lot I ask him what are you trying to say he ignore me and say just order something. I ask if I can replace it with something else he told me no I asked for a manager he said there's no manager and I would have to place my complaint online and good luck with that and he mumbled something under his breath but the way I look I will never go back to that place ever again.

What was suppose to be cheese is more watered down cheese, normal Mac and cheese has flavor this had absolutely no flavor what's so ever. My opinion is don't order Mac and cheese at this time 2-3 am."
828,zuxZtAredHPR1wrx12g1ng,7/27/2018,2 star rating,"This was my first visit and I was less than impressed by the lack of customer service when I first entered. The young lady who took my order had zero personality and offered no ""hello"" or ""can I take your order,"" even after I started with ""hi, how are you doing?"" She just stared at me as if I was wasting her time. She spoke very low, made no eye contact and mumbled. I'm not sure if it was a cultural thing or she just had no people skills. Anyway, I ordered the #1 combo (cheeseburger w/fries and a soda). I really enjoyed the cheeseburger, it reminded me of the whopper. The fries were cheap in my opinion they were on par with a Kennedy Fried Chicken but nowhere near McDonald's fries. They don't offer fountain soda, they just give you a can. The can of soda I was given was room temperature and I was forced to buy another drink because I took my order to go. I'm not sure if I'll try this again because I left with a bad feeling after my first visit here. In situations like this I don't blame the employees because they're typically teenagers, I blame management for allowing that type of conduct to flourish"

Waitresses are so rude. Bill came out 375 when other bars in Astoria where we ordered the same drinks and Same amount, it was around 220-240. It was my friend's birthday so we did not argue.

Our experience was definitely not impressive for a first time.I asked 4 times for water and after I am almost finished with my burger they show up with 2 bottles of water, NYC tap definitely not an option. They did something to my check and I found out they hide that  I was being charged for 4 bottles of water, I ask the server and she got us the right check (dishonest and theft actitud), after that we find out it's CASH ONLY and it wasn't listed nowhere, so my husband had to walk to the Chase. They included almost 22% Tip for a party of 2? I think it's a little offensive for a place that:1. Hide charges on your check.2. Can't pay 3% fee for a credit card machine.3. Doesn't have tap water.4. List tip as 20% but it's actually 22%I found out they are more like a ""club"" kind of place So it will be fun to come back for hookah and drinks if they change their dishonest actitud.The food was definitely good, Burger was juicy and tasty, margaritas were good and tiramisu was definitely a hit!!Server and busser were nice, and I always leave more that 20%tip regardless but at least give me water!

The guy came over told us it would be $35, he came back with the hookah, and asked for the $35 right then... and only cash. Okay, weird but whatever.... The hookah was awful. It had no kick, was super weak and the best part is, 20min later another guy comes over, claims there's an inspector and takes our hookah away with no offer of a refund or anything. We ended up waiting over an hour for our hookah which never came back bc allegedly there was an inspector ""downstairs""... where they took the hookah too -.- To make matters worse, we were charge almost $90 for 4 drinks. Absolutely insane. The gratuity was included... our waitress didn't come to our table unless we flagged her down. Honestly it was the most expensive disappointment in a long time. Not going back."

The drink were probably the only thing good. BUT what threw me off was we had a waitress doing her shift and she was leaving she gave us the bill and charged us for a 16oz which was fine ok... next girl comes in for her shift we asked for the same exact thing .. she charged us what like $3-$4 more. Got the bill and the cup was now 20oz. Mind you it was the same damn cup. The food was disgusting, the calamari wasn't even crispy it was a 2/10. Got the grilled chicken breast it was salty asf.. this spot isn't even all that for them to be charging so much for a damn drink. Two drink was $80  i could've just gotten a damn bottle. This spot is all over the place. They  charge different prices is your paying cash or with a card which is dumb then gratuity is added regardless if the waitress did her job or not.

This is a dive bar with loud music, bottle girls and a lot of hookah. We had a 9pm rsvp that I moved to 10:30. There was NO PARKING at all. Called and said we would be late and asked if we could still come - this is what pissed me off. The dude on the phone said sure. He would figure out a table for us. It wasn't a problem. Got in the place and it's super tiny, super loud, full of hookah and not a single person had food on their table.  Oh and half of the room is standing bc there's not enough space. One of the bottle girls (pretty girls in onesys instead of waitresses) kept rubbing her ass on me when she went by. Never saying excuse me. No one was finishing up their tab. How are we going to get a table? Eventually someone walks up and asks my name and then says ""..well you're late so.."" bro why didn't you say that on the phone? Why didn't you say hey we are very busy it's okay take your time come back @11:30-12?  Completely moronic. I double checked to make sure they did serve food and was told the kitchen closed @1:30 which would have been awesome but we couldn't even sit down.

You order on an the app and pay on the app with little to no communication with anyone there(I know its covid times..but we eat out several times a week and never experience this). Also,the door was locked when we got there(the hours said they were open for business)whoever sat us seemed annoyed by customers.

When we first got there, it was quite a long line, but it was moving fast until it wasn't. We were stuck in line for almost an hour and a half, but we were so close to the front that we healed out. What made it worst was Wednesdays. I don't eat food until after 6 pm. We got in line at 5:30 but didn't get there until seven. I was starving. However, once we got inside, all I can say was wow. Tomi is an underground Japanese-inspired jazz speakeasy. Being inside this place feels so special. We also sat in the front row of the jazz ensemble named the Nat Janoff group, who were phenomenal. The menu was on a QR code and had various drinks and bits to choose from. I got the Mandarin slush, which was Delightful. She got the lemon drop which was a lot stronger than expected but good. Food-wise, we feasted with the Veggie croquettes, which were incredible, the chicken wings, which were seasoned to perfection, and the beef curry, which was a bit sweeter than expected, tasted like mole, and was good. Some French fries were also good and came with Mayo and Ketchup. And for dessert, we got the Honey toast!! Which was the perfect end to a fantastic meal. Everything was so good, and Tomi even gave you a discount if you used cash. Dare I say I might wait an hour to experience that once more? Overall great space, food, and sounds. The wait may not be for you, but if you can hold out, Tomi jazz is worth your time and belly.5 out of 5"
874,lUpyqsKw-IBqsMgYIHZj7Q,1/10/2023,3 star rating,"I've came here a total of two times since visiting to living in New York and it was a different experience both times (hard to say which is more ""normal"") but the service and food experience were both much more amazing during our first visit, even though we also waited 3.5 hours. But still better compared to 4.5 hours alone I guess. Our first visit we got the curry omurice and cod roe udon, which both I'd rate 10/10. The croquettes weren't all that amazing at all tbh, nothing special and flavor was bland even though they gave a very basic dipping sauce on the side. The wasabi octopus was very appetizing for the taste buds, but so be aware you REALLY taste the wasabi in it. The omurice was very soft, warm and fresh but the rice however was the opposite. It was almost like sitting out in the cold air for a bit too long before applying on the omurice and the flavor could've been a little stronger on the rice as well. Nevertheless the egg and curry sauce made up for it. The cod roe udon, both texture of the noodles and flavor of the umami cod roe were perfect combination, couldn't have asked for anything different. However, my second visit, since waiting 4.5 hours despite a much shorter line too (which I didn't understand why it was), I had to order double orders to take one home. I was SO heavily disappointed when I got my omurice and noticed how firm and overcooked it was. Completely ruined the experience especially after that amount of waiting time and seeing that they're not really rushing their customers out anyways, they could at least use more attention towards their dish and small details such as these are important, especially when that's one of their well known. Sadly, I still do not think after these last couple times the wait is worth the food. It's not food you can't find anywhere else either, they are just a nicer vibe with live jazz music"

Crowded especially if you sit from of the jazz podium. Music was awesome but repetitive. Food was not too special but the drinks were good.-Plum wine ($8-9): matcha plum drink was amazing. Had three glasses of them. Reasonable price.-Okonomiyaki: typical okonomiyaki. Great flavor but a bit overpriced.-Mandarine martini: not the most favorite. Tasted a little bit like a syrup type medicine to me personally but can be your favorite if you like sweet, fruity martini.Overall, great experience."

We got there early near 5pm to snag some spots and as soon as we stepped in realized why there's always a long line - there really aren't that many seats inside, but it makes for such a cozy vibe, so my biggest recommendation is to get there early if you can!! There were two bands that played when we were there, both of which created such a fun atmosphere. It also wasn't too loud so you can still have a conversation and hear the person across from you! In terms of the food, we ordered the following:Salmon rice balls - they were much more filling than we expected but the rice and nori were both very tasty, and the salmon inside was well seasoned tooCorn croquettes - came out nice and toasty, and the bites were very flavorful and generously sized as well  Omelette rice - the rice is seasoned well and the omelette is creamy and light! The sauce pairs really nicely with the dish and we really enjoyed this Talk Soba - also a really unique dish that we loved! The soba is served with a crispy egg base and there were fish flakes (I think) on top that added a nice salty touch. I can't pinpoint exactly what went into this dish but I do know that it's tasty! The prices were also all super reasonable and overall we had an amazing experience!"

We waited 2.5+ hours outside to get in - apparently the wait isn't as bad right after they open. Luckily, the wait wasn't too bad, but I wasn't expecting close to 3 hours.Plum wine was so good!! Normally not a fan of wine, but ended up loving it. Heard the food is great here as well. The inside is pretty small and very intimate in terms of seating. Would definitely try to go back at a better time :)"
878,lUpyqsKw-IBqsMgYIHZj7Q,11/17/2022,5 star rating,"Super cute jazz bar with cozy ambiance. They start playing music at 6pm but the restaurant opens at 5pm. I highly recommend coming right at 5pm or even a couple minutes before to get in line or else it might a couple hour wait to get in. They have a time limit of 2hrs per party. We came around 5 pm on a Thursday and there were no line before us. However, couple minutes immediately there were maybe 4-5 groups waiting behind us. They only sets you once you have all party present. The wait staffs are super friendly and are happy to explain and give recommendations on food & drinks. We got: 1. Tofu salad                    5/52. Raw Squid dish   (Didn't eat I can't eat raw food)3. Baked Chikuwa with mozzarella (oden fish cake)                                  5/54. Curry udon                   2/55: Seafood Spaghetti       2/56. Omurice                        5/57. Cod Roe Spaghetti       4/5 My favorite dishes are the tofu salad, baked chikuwa, and Omurice. The tofu salad was refreshing and a great appetizer. The chiluwa was unique and juicy. It's hard to not like fish cake and cheese combo. The Omurice was a show stopper! The egg is so fluffy and melts in your mouth. The flavoring was just right for this dish as I was worried since the udon and spaghetti dishes were all not very flavorful. I highly recommend Omurice as your entree! We sat right next to the jazz band but it actually wasn't overly loud. The dim lighting made this place cozy and romantic. I came with a group of friends but would highly recommend this as a date spot."

They even make some of the spirits in house, like a green tea vodka!food wise, they have an omurice that's pretty good but they specialize in a lot of small plates.

Definitely fishy, which I was expecting, but it was unique and good. The pasta was cooked perfectly. Lastly the omurice was really good, maybe a bit too liquify cause of the meat stew on the outside but the flavors meshed well, so it was my favorite.Drinks were good, but they did take a sec to come out.In terms of ambiance, the music was great but i got sat the closest to the band so it was a bit tight and hard to hear anything."

The Cod Roe Spaghetti is to die for and I really enjoyed their plum wine series.

Rolled up at 5:45 for 6:00 doors expecting I was gonna be a several rows back. Nope, I just walked right up to the stage! I chatted with the friendly peeps around me, who at this show were mostly college students from Pace, New School, Pratt etc. Someone told me the drinks were overpriced but since I don't drink it didn't really matter to me.The bill was a sold out show featuring up and coming hyperpop artist Alice Longyu Gao and reigning queen of raunch rap Cupcakke. An unexpected combo. The crowd didn't get as hype as I was for ALG even though she put on a great energetic performance. I understand there isn't as much crossover in their fanbases as there usually is for a headliner and opener. Still she popped off and played awesome new music that got me excited for her album. Things really got lit when Cupcakke hit the stage. The empty room where I walked right up to the stage was no more, and the place was packed to the gills. Everyone shouted along to her classics like Deep Throat and Old Town H*e. She had such great energy. You can see it in the pics. Thank you Elsewhere for booking Queen Elizab*tch herself.Cupcakke said during her set that NYC remained her favorite place to do a show and I can see why when there are perfectly sized venues ready to sell out and vibe out when she comes to town. Show ended nice and early at 10, so it'd be totally possible to go out and do something else after. I just caught the subway. It was 5 min away, if even. I don't know what some reviewers are saying about the area being desolate; Mission Chinese, House of Yes, and more restaurants and clubs are within a few blocks. Anyway I caught the L, went home, went to bed, satisfied with my elsewhere experience. I'm gonna be back for the Lil Mariko, Magdalena Bay, and Umru shows in October!"

886,Q02uPdw8j8yDIVSPyJATjA,9/19/2019,3 star rating,"Loved the band I saw, and the staff at the venue were really nice, but they need to work on some things.The AC is almost non-existent. We were inside due to rain (rooftop was closed) and were sweating buckets before the show even started. The line outside the door was around the block, and they delayed the start time of the show until everyone got in. I appreciate that, but at the same time standing out in the rain to enter a sweatbox and then wait an hour past start time is NOT fun. Bar (just two bartenders) was predictably swamped as a result of nothing going on. It's also really, really small. Even with a well behaved crowd, exiting once the show is over is rough, dancing you feel like you're just rubbing up against other sardines. I grabbed my stuff early because I could sense the looming chaos and was glad I did. Otherwise sound and lighting were decent for a small venue. The unisex bathroom is interesting. On the night I was there, they had someone in the center of the room on a stool. I asked if they were a bathroom attendant (their gender was unclear, not that I cared, but this was in part how I found out the bathroom was unisex). They told me no, they were there to make sure everything stayed safe, and that everyone there tonight was so calm and nice, that it was a big difference from the crowds they usually dealt with. As happy as I am that the band I came to see has such a cool fan base, that's not a comforting statement. This employee was not a bouncer or security, I'm not sure what intervention would have been used had something happened, but it was strange. Maybe don't have the only available bathroom be unisex if you can't keep people from being hurt? One of the investors has been accused of rape by multiple people, and community outreach at this ""safe space"" was supposedly stalled by the venue itself. There is a boycott of the venue, I'm not sure what the status currently is. Given my experience and the information I found online regarding the lack of transparency about the rape allegations, I doubt I'll be coming back here."

Second, no need to have guests guess where you want to stamp them; just let them know. Beyond entry, I've been to a lot of shows in my day and never have I seen a headliner, with TWO opening acts no less, end a show at 10pm. Is Anna of the North working on Norwegian time? (kidding, kinda). Am I missing something? We arrived at the venue around 9:15 (doors were 7) and I guess she must have been 3-5 songs in (assuming she went on around 8:30? - absurdly early for a Sat night show) so we only caught 4 or 5 fun jams. I digress, the little of what we heard of the show was fantastic- she played some good hits, dance-alongs, the slowest Price cover ever (zzzzz) and the mixing and sound were well balanced. Aside from a bit too much reverb on Anna's mic, they sounded great. Word to the wise: get to this place early, headliners are completely off stage by 10pm, weak sauce if you ask me!"

Drink prices were kind of insane--$12 for a can of KCBC beer--but so it goes, I guess. The thing that irked me was how quickly they pushed everyone out (or upstairs) after the show to clear room for a DJ/dance night. I give the staff credit--they were as friendly as possible--but it felt brusque, and seemed like an odd, congruous mix of programming for a night. I guess I'd come back for the absolute right show.

My espresso came out with no cream (I mean, it's hard to take orders and chat at the same time so I get it but also just do your job), which is obviously not a big deal but it made me feel justified in my annoyance. Right around closing time a drunk and disorderly patron was generally causing problems and ended up throwing a stool. The staff was very professional with him, even after he began slinging racial epithets. He eventually left, pausing to heckle a few other customers on the way out, but the behaviour of the staff was really admirable.

I'm not knowledgeable about coffee so when my bf told me I would love their coffee I thought that I probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference. So I was wrong there is definitely a difference. I got a 16oz latte. And it was really good. Another great thing.. Their cups and lids are so heavy they keep the warmth in - 40 min later and my coffee had kept warm at the bottom... Warmer than it was outside.. I thought it made the experience more enjoyable. They have a bunch of other cute, personal sized goodies that come in unique packaging.

Ordered the samosas 5 for $18 and they were better than expected. Thats not am insult, as i expected the food to be good based on the reciews. The chicken was a little dry, but seasoned well. The beef ones were really good! Also got two happy hour drinks, my wife the Sangria margarita and I got a classic Brazilian rum (forgot was it was called, but it was good) really good food for the price."

I decided to try new items and they did not disappoint! Portion of rotisserie chicken is solid with a good mix of white and dark meats. The green aji sauce had nice freshness from the cilantro and a kick from the peppers. I would put that on everything! The braised beef was plentiful and although very seasoned, it just didn't hit the spot the same way. And of course, the delicious sweet plantains really took this meal to the next level. If you haven't ordered Blend for lunch yet, what are you doing!"

The food was delicious; the utensils and dishes were completely clean;our waitress kept stopping by often to make sure that everything was okay. Our dishes and drinks came pretty fast, despite the fact that the place was actually busy during our visit. They also had a staff member walking around with a camera taking pictures (if you agreed to have them taken) and if you liked any of them you could buy it for $15 per image, which I thought was pretty good. The images came with a cardboard frame with the name of the restaurant and it looked pretty nice, I ended up buying 3 pictures out of the 4 we took. As you can see on my previous comment,  the Manager of the location reached out to me, both in public and privately, he asked me to inform him the next time I stopped by, as he wanted to make sure that I would have a better experience. I actually did not let him know when I went last month, and that was not on purpose, but regardless things ended up being great. The fact that the Manager took the time to read my post, and to respond to it speaks very highly of the place and its management. I would definitely recommend this place and I will definitely be back!"

The ambiance is definitely for pictures but the FOOD definitely do not recommend. The only thing we liked were the empanadas, the pasta was TASTELESS. Salt and black pepper were added and still was not enough, the shrimp were good, but that's all. The caption says it all, if you need a spot for pictures go here, but only eat empanadas and have a drink. I would not recommend for a date night. Sorry, not sorry."

My favorite dishes are the citrus crusted salmon for dinner and the tres golpes for brunch . My boyfriend loves the ropa vieja which comes with rice and beans. For apps I really love the calamari, cubao buns, arepa cups and the empanadas. We always get the sangrita which is just frozen margarita and sangria. One of these and you'll feel nice . Most of their drinks are really good though. The space is large with seating available at the bar, main floor and an upstairs. Music is always great too!"
926,bB8dHfAEJrF5tNcHr0yJjA,4/17/2022,4 star rating,A large group of us stopped by for lunch/brunch after a surprise proposal at Gantry. It was a little after just noon and we were seated immediately indoors. Our waitress was super patient and attentive with taking all 14 of our food and drink orders and refilling our water. All of our food generally came at the same time and was still warm. I ordered the veggie paella - well-flavored and savory. Came with a small side of plantains/maduros and I'm not usually the one to go crazy for these but still yummy. My boyfriend ordered arroz con Pollo - presentation-wise it looked exactly like my paella except with chicken. He said the chicken was a little on the dry side though. My friend that sat across from me ordered the churrasco - I can tell it was cooked to her medium liking just by the way she cut into it. She also said it was delicious. Overall a good experience - a satisfying meal. Would come back to maybe try more of their drink selections (didn't get pictures of them) if I am ever in the area because they were on the stronger side.

Here's why:1) Latte: They use quality beans and froth the milk making their latte very creamy. It almost doesn't need sugar.2) Owner: Hugh Jackman owns it. Enough said.3) Space: It's large for NYC and has plenty of seating including a bench out front. It used to be an old theater and the movie posters remain on the walls as decorations."

You can expect your cookies to be delivered hot and ready to enjoy. The best part is; they dont serve up those crumbly type of cookies that just make you angry on the inside, their cookies are always fresh. Only qualm is that sometimes they can take forever to arrive if you order delivery. There have been 2 occasions where I order a box to be delivered within the hour and it takes 2+ hours to get to my door. Nonetheless, insomnia cookies are always worth the wait in my opinion."
941,SdQsynrdEjalHmiZ9lK5dw,9/15/2020,3 star rating,"I placed an order on my phone for 6 cookies and came to pick it up. When I got there I saw the ice cream and was hoping to test a few flavors out since I intended to buy a pint, but they understandably weren't giving out samples due to their covid policy. The music was RIDICULOUSLY loud I could not even hear the woman behind the counter over it. I asked for a pint of chocolate ice cream which she proceeded to scoop without gloves on, despite the fact that her coworker standing right next to her was wearing gloves. I honestly lost my appetite for the ice cream after seeing that and the customer service was really abrasive and cold.Definitely not a welcoming or pleasant experience in the store, but the cookies were melty and good. The 3 stars are for the cookies, knocked 1 star off for the rude service and ridiculous volume in the store and another star off for no gloves (an absolute turn off, especially during their ""covid policy"").  Haven't tried the ice cream yet, not entirely sure I would return or recommend this location."

We were told to order online right outside the entrance.  We weren't allowed in. Then the online order said it would be ready in 30 minutes.

I love that they sell milk and that the cookies are always warm. My favorites are the white chocolate macadamia, snickerdoodle and oatmeal raisin. The ""witches"" aka cookie sandwiches are good, but I prefer the cookies a la mode because you can add more toppings to the scoop(s) of ice cream. Service could be better, every time I come in the cashiers look so unhappy. Other than that its a pretty good location.There's a park right across the street which makes for a cute little date when the weather is nice. They're also open late and do deliveries if you're ever around the area but are too lazy to come in."

Neither store nor head quarters was not willing to speak, listen or assist with the order due to being ordered on Uber Eats. Uber Eats is currently not taking any phone calls. Therefore there is no customer service from each end to assist. You will be temper to buy these cookies over the internet but you're better off going to the store yourself to making sure they do not mess up your order. Check you box and bag before you leave."

I said it's in there. She asked me if I wanted anything else. I said why would I want something else when you have bugs in your food!? She only reimbursed me for the Big Mac vs the whole order.

And yay for sustainably resourced ingredients, no hormones, etc etc - information is on the website, where you can conveniently order your Americanized super size goliath burrito and then pick up so you don't have to wait on the monstrous line that inevitably forms during Midtown lunch crush where some hangry* man standing outside the door in the 36 degree weather snidely quips at you to get to the back of the line. No. No hangry man. Because I'm literally 30 steps in front of you. Boo-yah. The entrance to this particular location is on 50th Street - NOT Park. Its the Northwest corner. The space is tight, with seating for less than 40 people and a line literally out the door on to the sidewalk, even in March. The line moves fast, but you gotta be a particular kind of desperate to wait outside for ""fast food"" when its freezing out. At 1 pm, there were maybe two seats open, assuming you'd like to share a table with the lonely Midtown drones sadly checking their emails over their barbacoa tacos. The line would have probably taken you 15 minutes of waiting, based on the location of hangry man to when I walked out. Like almost every Chipotle, decor is Mass Produced Mayan Moderne. There are stairs - so this location may not be ADA friendly. Staff moves as fast as they can. And the place is decently clean at the beginning of lunch crush with easy access to restrooms. Prices are normal. The woman handling the online orders was sweet, taking a bit of extra time to find me the juice I wanted, even though it wasn't in the front case. Will I go as far as Maryam H to say its the best Chipotle in the city? Nah. I did get an over flowing burrito bowl (when you order online, some places tend to shaft you because you don't watch them make it) so that is a great plus. But the layout is awkward (think of poor hangry man standing outside because the line couldnt fit inside!) so thats going to even out to a 3 star, a okay. *Hangry: The irrational emotional state of being angry, frustrated, and grumpy due to extreme hunger. Cookie Monster meets Oscar the Grouch. Usually results in regrettable decision making or volatile confrontations. tl;dr version - Order online. Don't be a jerk. Tasty burritos."

I mean it is midtown though, so maybe my expectations were over the top. Anyways, I came in here recently to redeem the free chipotle offered from the ""Raincheck"" text and this was at approximately 1pm. The line was out the door, as it usually is but Chipotle always moves pretty quickly. I feel that I have to give this location a much better rating than my previous Chipotle location because this place is always well prepared for the lunch rush. I didn't have any problems with any of the ingredients and they were generous in portions as well. The employees aren't super friendly, but maybe it's the lunch hour that causes a lack of time to socialize."

Here's why:Before getting in line, I went to use the ladies' room, which is a single-person restroom (and should be converted to an ANY GENDER bathroom very shortly, according to New York law.) Girls do take longer than guys in the restroom for a myriad of reasons, but I wasn't in there a minute before someone tried the handle a couple times (which I thankfully locked) and knocked at the door. I called, ""Occupied!"", and proceeded to do my thing. A couple seconds later, more knocking. I called, ""Just a minute!,"" thinking they hadn't heard me the first time. About 5 seconds later, more, insistent knocking. My patience being tried, I called ""Look, you're going to have to wait!"" What did they expect me to do? Forego my own business in favor of theirs? I finished, washed and dried my hands, put my coat back on, and opened the door.Was someone dying out there? The other onesie restroom occupied? Just a rude customer? No, to all of these. The persistent knocker was a female CHIPOTLE STAFF MEMBER. We locked eyes, but she didn't say a thing. Just sauntered into the restroom without a hurry.Incredulous, I walked right out. I don't want people like that being responsible for my food and my health. Now I'm hungry AND annoyed. Won't be back."

I ordered the garlic knots which were $1.75 for 6, he gave us the rest of his last batch, and the last vodka slice. It was a hard decision over the greens slice and eggplant slice. My coworker ordered the chicken square slice and we were both extremely disappointed. The pizzas were flavorless and dry. The crust was basically a sesame cracker - hard, crunchy and dry. There wasn't much sauce on our slices and the cheese seemed over done. The cashier (possibly owner?) was nice though - he gave 2 free plain slices to a man that didn't speak English and tried to order pizza. That was extremely generous of him. The downside was the cashier smoked right after serving us, and before serving him, and somehow we left smelling like smoke."

I'm amazed I've never heard of them before, though the pizzeria might be overshadowed by its more famous neighbor, L&B's (10-min walk away). The pizza's thin crust creates a crisp and delicious toothy texture. The abundance of cheese also means every bite comes with a stringy cheese trail. Most importantly, the sesame seed-studded crust is a crunchy delightful post-pizza breadstick snack-- how awesome is that?!Ciccio's is equidistant from the N and F Avenue U train stations and accessible by B3 bus. Plus it's within walking distance of L&B's so treat yourself to both!"

I've been coming to Ciccio's since the mid 90's and along with a delicious slice also came consistency. Nicky and company always made a fenomenal pie, but since new ownership all I can say is that times have changed. When I lived in the neighborhood I would sometimes order two pies within a week. (Yes not the best health choices, but it was THAT delicious!!!) I do feel new owners have tried their best to stick to the original recipe, but the Sofia pie just isn't the same. Needless to say it still is a good slice. But I used to swear by Ciccio's to the point of having arguments and even convincing a few people that it was the best slice in New York! I sadly cannot continue with the same bravado and confidence. To the new owners all I can say is please call Nicky and get back to the basics. Skip the basil and extra olive oil. The slice is better without it. Trust. You will have repeat customers. For life!!! And please I beg you perfect the crust again. This time was too dough-y and not crispy. The pizza lives and dies by the crust. Make Ciccio's great again! -loyal fan and customer."

Then, he told me I need to reorder it on the food delivery app. I ended up having my dinner at 10pm because when I reordered, the restaurant took forever to process my order and had the delivery guy waiting for my order for over 30 minutes.

I think the pita sandwiches are what's best to get from here -- cheaper than the platter and more flavorful. The grilled chicken is tasty and the sauce brings the lettuce, tomato, onion all together. It's affordable and easy to eat but don't let it sit too long or the sauce might make your pita soggy"

I didn't even know if she was making another, until the other guy working there brought me out another. This one tasted faintly of banana and nothing else. So strange. I cannot tolerate a bad attitude as any person with a brain would have complained if they were given ice. My partners drink didn't even taste bad but I will never go there again because of the all around strange experience."

You can't really mess that up but some how they did. It was just very watered down. No flavor whatsoever. Maybe they just dont use enough fruit into their smoothies and its mostly ice and milk

The coffee's not that good here.""Gotta love the honesty, I suppose.Turns out the coffee was delicious. Piping hot, and dark, rich coffee... not bitter or old-tasting.Plus, the dude did try to up-sell me on a slice of pie. So he was sorta trying."

After asking for the 3.79 deal I inevitably had to go back to my original order to avoid wasting any more time. I would never recommend this case for the horrible customer service it provides."

Both of the times I've gone there I've gotten their burritos (super) and chips and guac, both of which were excellent.

It reminded me of the Blockheads restaurants in terms of atmosphere and quality. The main thing they offer here are enchilada plates or burritos. We had several of both with different meats - beef, chicken, shrimp, pork, or vegetarian are all offered. The flavor of the meat, rice, and beans on our plates were all good. There is definitely a lot of care taken into seasoning the meat. Portion sizes of everything were on the small side though.

After waiting around for far too long, I was able to sit down, but unfortunately the store's music was far too loud. Worst of all, the water temp of my tea started out as way too cold, so I had under-extracted lukewarm jasmine. 1/5 stars.Hence, my review: 3/5."

As soon as we pick a favorite, we get a new brew and are yet again surprised to like the new roast even better.So glad we discovered Variety Roasters and their awesome subscription service!"

I came here back in 2010 and it was delightful. Down to earth, local vibe. They always had flyers for things in the neighborhood. Then after the big remodeling the flyers were gone. I guess they didn't go with the new decor. Lol. Now it's just a busy, fairly expensive place with no soul. I still dig the coffee but it's very rare that I bother to come even though I'm two blocks away. I'm really happy they're doing well and expanding but at this point they're just a modern chain.

1065,3gbN7EcImU1Ltf4XkWoSeg,12/29/2017,4 star rating,"A very Brooklynesque cafe as part of the variety stores. If you look closely, it has that worn out quasi-appeal of a lived in living room with plenty of space for laptoping while drinking their special brew. The little restroom is spacious but somehow the toilet is right next to the door...The espresso is strong and uplifting but I actually gravitate towards their cold brew for the most part. It's harder to drink in the winter however. The vanilla flavoring as an add in on the counter is definitely a win. They're ethically sourced which is important and sell the beans if you feel so inclined to make your own brews."

Some of the better people watching locations I've seen BTW.The assortment of muffins and pastries was huge and the coffee accouterments were nailed down to so many kinds of milks I wanted to try them all.I'm in New York for a while.

I had never experienced in my entire life for someone to treat me the way he was! He managed run away on the middle of me ordering... mumbling something while walking away ...Some other girl was there working too.  When I asked her about the manager or the owner , she said she doesn't know how can I reach out to to someone to complain about this disaster, she was defending this guy AJ.The craziest part , here it comes. I got home , about to eat my bagel ... and the cream cheese is sour(strawberry cream cheese). Simple question- why do I deserve to get treated that way??? What did I do to get screamed at and cursed at ???Being 7 months pregnant , I could simply get sick from that cream cheese .... and from the stress I just went thru at that place I could end up at the hospital !!!! This pandemic is hard for everyone and took a toll on everyone , but I don't run around curing and yelling at people !We all going thru something , everyone should understand that and treat each other with respect !

I would understand if the place was empty but there was a line with quite a bit of people. On top of that, the person ringing everyone up overcharged me and wasn't even apologetic about it AND she only refunded me $5 instead of the full $7.50. Didn't make a scene since other people were waiting, but I certainly should have since she paid me little attention when I asked her about it and just moved on to the next customer. Onto the food now - the bagels are bigger and fresh, though I wish they would toast it instead of just heating it up. They fill up the bagel with A LOT of spread which makes up for their high prices. Their lox spread however was more on the cream cheese side than on the salmon side. I didn't really taste the salmon and barely saw little pieces in the cream cheese. In terms of returning, I'd probably come back once in a blue moon or just go to another bagel spot with better customer service."

MIGHTY Bowl sells rice bowls that you yourself get to personalize with whatever you want for a flat rate depending on the size, small or large. The small is already pretty large in my opinion so unless you normally have a big appetite or are extremely hungry, stick with the small. If you're an indecisive person who cannot decide what you want in your bowl, that's alright because MIGHTY Bowl also has a selection of options where the choice is already made for you and all you have to do is pick the one that sounds the best to you! Their pre-made bowls have a pretty cool theme too, each bowl is named after a popular place like Shanghai, Bangkok, California, Tokyo, Bali, Penang or Seoul and then that bowl is created based off of the stereotypical cuisine in that particular area. I got the Seoul bowl, which had grilled steak, kimchi, scallions, bonita flakes, sesame seeds, bean sprouts, cucumber salad and gochujang sauce that makes it a little bit spicy. It was amazing, the steak was cooked very tenderly and there was just so much flavor in every bite of the bowl, I would highly recommend it!

I was excited to try a new Caribbean spot since I love the food.I visited on a Tuesday afternoon around 2pm and they didn't have a lot of options. The guy behind the counter stated they had No mac n cheese, No collards, no Yams come on. I was looking forward to the mac n cheese n yams that the Yelp reviews raved about. I told the guy it's really early for yall to be out of so much food and he stated they were still cooking. The guy seemed to look at me like who is this lady questioning me? With it being such a small restaurant I was shocked how many items wasn't available and this seemed to be a pattern based on reviews of lots of menu items not available. Why offer these items if you can't maintain the demand for them. If I was to come to this spot again and that's a strong If, I would definitely call first so you don't go in there hungry thinking you're getting something that sounds yummy but they don't have any more left.I finally settled for the Jerk chicken, rice n peas and cabbage which was pretty good, not the best or worst I've had. The amount of food was a little smaller than I am used to but it is what is.  If I am in the area and there's nothing else available I would definitely eat here again, whatever they have available. However, I would not go out of my way to come back for Caribbean food when there are sooo many other places nearby that will have the menu items available."

I've had all types of soul food, but this spot definitely topped my experiences (in terms of portion and cost). The amount of food given, even for my ""small"" combo, was unheard of for soul food. I only wish I took a picture to show how good the food was, but I ate it too quick! Next time I'm in Harlem I'll make sure to make this my first stop."

I had been wanting comfort food, and Wat's On Your Plate delivered. The jerk chicken with Mac and cheese was amazing. However, without ordering extra sides, the food was more than enough. The chicken came with a supple amount of rice and cabbage. They used bones in the rice for flavor. It was amazing, but vegetarians should be aware. My partner and I shared this, and we were stuffed. I've been suggesting we go back soon. It's a small restaurant, so I definitely recommend this for take out."

I was happy to find one so close and walked over right away to satisfy my craving. No roti! Fine, I'll get the oxtail with rice & peas and veg to go. They tell me to come back on Sunday because they'll have roti then. My food was good, so I listen and I show up on Sunday with my husband. No roti again! I had already walked up there so curry chicken with mac & cheese and veg for me, jerk chicken and rice for my husband. The macaroni was sooo good! The rest of my food was also very good, his jerk was nice and spicy so he was happy to have one of the Jamaican sodas from behind the counter. The portions here are huge! We both ordered the small serving and when our food came out we couldn't believe it. (I think you might get a little more food if you opt to eat there, but I can't even imagine what the large looks like)After these two trips, I learned my lesson and started calling ahead of time. On 3-4 separate occasions I call and ask for roti to be told that they don't have any. Then finally they do so I order a few and walk over, only to realize that they don't offer them boneless. Sigh. I know that roti with bone-in meat is more traditional but it's so hard to eat. It was delicious and if I was really craving roti and in a pinch I would order it again, but for the most part it's not worth the hassle. I am glad that I found Wat's On Your Plate for when I'm craving curry chicken, etc etc."

You can smell the steak cooking from outside! I am not a big meat eater but it still smells great and inviting. The portions of the food are huge and I always have leftovers. It is pretty much comfort food for me. I feel a lot of places can mess up a bean and cheese burrito but this place, makes it the best. Nachos are amazing too. The Cali burrito is stuffed with everything you could possibly want.  I go on my days off around lunch time and its always busy. They got a new ordering screen so if there is a line, it moves pretty fast. The food is always ready in under 20 minutes so you are not waiting around long. Highly recommend for people in this area."

I love this place so much that it almost kills me to not give it 5 stars, so I'll start with my reason for the markdown: they seemingly don't have AC in the summer or heat (as I found out tonight) in the winter. It's incredibly unpleasant to eat there when you're freezing your butt off, and my boyfriend and I live too far away to take the food home. Now, onto the positive: this is some seriously good, seriously cheap Mexican food. Most items on the menu are around $10 or cheaper and the portion sizes are generous. The meat is cooked to order and is consistently great. The food isn't the prettiest thing in the world, but it's filling and delicious. Also, $4 beers? Sign me up. Workers are always really nice. They take cards too which is huge. You order at the counter but there are plenty of seats inside. There's tapatio hot sauce at every table and there are a few salsas to try too. Pickled jalapeños are self-serve. Guacamole is included and the portion size is BIG. All in all, this place is the real deal. I had someone tell me that the best Mexican food should be no more than $15 a plate and this place is the perfect example to corroborate."

Every time I order, all the items I ask for, besides the original sliders, are either ""out"" or will take 15 minutes to make. It's kind of ridiculous how many times this has happened and I've never been there without it happening. Then, when I do order just the basics, it takes at least 15 minutes waiting in my car in the drive through to get 4 or 5 items.And even worse, there isn't some sort of apology or understanding comment when I do finally get my food. It's just like, ""here.""Sorry, not coming back."

Mozzarella sticks weren't horrible but it did feel like I was eating diabetes. I tried drowning the chicken rings in ketchup to make it bearable but that didn't work too well cause it still tasted gross. People that worked there were kind of what you would expect from someone spending their day in White Castle. They weren't rude but they weren't exactly nice either, can't really blame them being surrounded by that nasty food smell all day.

1128,p7AK3xaLGgyG1jYP8kSzNw,10/31/2021,5 star rating,"I've been coming here for about 6 months now and after todays coffee I just had to write a review. I usually order online but I've been coming in more often to try and save some coins. I've tried their breakfast pastries, lunch sandwiches, quiche, and their egg sandwiches. I always get the same thing now: egg wrap with Turkey and avocado. I've tried to get this simple combo at other places and it's never as satisfying as Cafe One's! Now on to the glorious glorious coffee! I work for a coffee company who roasts their own coffee and while it's pretty delicious, Lá Colombe is honestly a close second to some of my favorite coffee in existence. It's gotten to the point where I purchase the beans from Cafe One and they happily grind them for my French Press (even tho I can get free coffee from work!) I'm a non dairy person so I usually either get a black coffee (5/5) full bodied and smooth, no acidity whatsoever, a Soy Hazelnut Latte or Oat Caramel Latte. Both are 5/5 but the Oat Caramel was a little too sweet for me. Oat Milk has a lot of sugar on its own so I would ask for less pumps of the caramel next time. Now I'm writing this review because I'm trying to avoid both Oat and Soy milk as much as possible, but every time I order an almond latte somewhere it's gross. I decided to take my chances here since I know the espresso here is good and I was not disappointed. This is the first almond latte I've had that was not only good, but quite delicious. Of course it still had that weird taste that almond milk has to me (idk what it is!), but it was very subtle and the espresso mellowed everything out. I will say beware of the Iced Lattes if you're sensitive to caffeine. I got one the other day and was bouncing off the walls. It is VERY strong and I drink espresso every day! Anyway if you're in the area, check them out. They have a decent size menu, ample seating (outdoor too) and a friendly and competent staff. They also have other treats and lots of cool drinks like Recess which is a Hemp and Adaptogen drink and is super calming. Please bring CASH to tip your baristas and cashiers because they don't have a CC tipping option available :("

The bacon was nice and crispy like I asked and it was just so flavorful. The sandwich (which was large) came with chips. I also ordered a Hal's seltzer and that was $9 under. Definitely worth it! The space is small so seating is limited BUT, the good comes out so quickly! My friends who ordered food here said their food was so good.

Thus the staff was struggled and could not scan it, then she checked it afterwards and told us in the most rude and vulgar manner that: this is not collard green.

I was surprised, lol, I always thought it was just pizza, rolls, rice balls etc. so I ordered lasagna and a regular mixed salad. Hubs got the pasta with meat sauce, prosciutto and mushrooms. The lasagna was full of meat, I actually saw ricotta and plenty of mozzarella, sauce was good too. Salad was just a regular mixed salad, iceberg, red onions, cucumbers and tomato. Everything was fresh, it looked fresh besides tasting that way. The lasagna noodles were perfectly cooked! Not mushy at all. Next time we'll try something different.

Now I understand the poor Yelp ratings. Avoid this place."

It sat in the corner by Modells and I always ignored it ... until finally my hunger caught up with me on a Sunday afternoon.My wife and I walked in after some errands and, to my surprise, the restaurant was packed. There were a few booths left and some stool seats. Although the place is not too big, there are plenty of seating booths inside to accommodate the many shoppers coming in for a meal.Once we walked in, we could see all of the pre-made topping pizzas sitting behind the counter. There was a pretty good variety of different pizzas, including, spinach, eggplant, mushroom, sausage, pepperoni, ham and pineapple, just to name a few. Besides pizza, they also made different appetizers, rolls, heros, salads and wraps.For us? We were craving pizza and that's what we went with. I won't go into detail about the toppings of the pizzas we ordered, except that they definitely don't skimp on toppings, so you'll get your money's worth if you go with a pizza with toppings. On the other hand, we did notice something odd about their pizza with toppings versus their regular slices. The regular slices were thinner and less doughy, while the pizzas with toppings had a very thick bottom crust. It wasn't really a problem, but it felt like it didn't need it. We preferred pizzas with thinner crust and believed the pizzas with toppings would have tasted better if they didn't have thick crusts.With the lack of meal options in Caesars Bay, especially pizza, Pizza D'Amore is going to really win out with the kids. By no means is it a bad food option. The pizza isn't that bad, but it can be a bit pricey."

Tonight I called to pick up the knots and asked them if they can make a plate of grilled chicken for my little fur buddy and asked for minimal or no seasonings. As usual the knots were amazing, but they cut the chicken into tiny pieces for my dog and I found that to be really nice. The workers are also very friendly. I definitely recommend this pizzaria. Great food and great staff who are all smiles which is always a plus. No wonder it's usually packed in here."

My mom caught it thank god she didn't eat it or else she would have swollen a rock  and be sent in the ER during a pandemic  like no way...this is disgusting... let's give this a review of 0 outta of 0 and not I feel bad for small business during a pandemic but because the owner was a complete ass...never again!!"

1162,roT-M9epcHDOGjYgGmWpoA,5/24/2022,3 star rating,"We came here because it was within walking distance of our hotel and had a decent rating.  The dining room is cavernous, but clean and well appointed for an old school Italian restaurant. My companion ordered a glass of red wine which she found objectionable, so sent it back.  Unfortunately the wine-by-the-glass selection was limited to exactly one red.  In an Italian restaurant.  Sigh.The food came quickly as it was earlyish in the evening and things seemed relatively quiet.  I had the rigatoni amatraciana.  The pasta seemed almost a little too al dente.  I have been to Italy, as well as multiple Italian restaurants over several decades, I know al dente, and this was slightly under cooked.  However, the sauce was good.  My companions seemed satisfied with their meals, if not effusive.I think, for me, what put me off a bit, was the service.  It was attentive, but almost too much so.  I couldn't shake the continued sense that they were there to upsell us.  And when we declined whatever additional thing they were suggesting, I got the sense that they were disappointed, with a very subtle hint of derision."

The main reason I love Raj's is because while I like flavorful food with tons of spices, I do not like when the food has a lot of heat and sometimes when I ask for mild it seems like they also forget to flavor the food.  Raj's does a great job on delivering flavorful mild versions of their dishes.  They have plenty of vegetarian options but my go-tos are the paneer mahkni and the mutter paneer.  They are both quite similar so usually decide based on whether I am in the mood for peas or not.  Both sauces are very creamy and tomatoey, although less tomatoey than a Tikka masala.  Delivery is very quick but they are also within a block for me so I have gone in person as well and they are very nice and attentive to in-person patrons despite having to field so many online delivery orders.  If you do decide to go in person, make sure you ring the bell because they are really working hard back there to fulfill those online orders and might not notice you have arrived for pickup or dining in otherwise."

Here were the stand outs:+ Butter chicken: the sauce was so velvety and paired perfectly with rice. + Lamb biriyani: there were HUGE chunks of lamb in this dish. Very well spiced, very flavorful. It also came with yogurt sauce, which was creamy and balanced the spice of this dish perfectly. Be prepared for this dish to be on the spicier side.+ Garlic Naan: Soft. Essential."

I'm low key upset I didn't try it sooner..Food: 4/5We ordered chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala and naan -everything in medium spice. Both the biryani and masala had a ton of flavor but the chicken in the biryani could have been more tender as i found it slightly dry. The naan was phenomenal with the thick masala sauce. Overall, this is great spot that will satisfy your Indian craving. I would order spicy instead of medium next time but that's my preference. Ambiance: 3/5Yelp has the address as QPS but as of 10/10/21, they're on QPN. They had a sign notifying their customers that they will be relocating again near Jacx. I feel the ambiance category is not worth much merit here as the business has been clearly trying to find their new home. As of now, it's set up as a quick pick up spot. Maybe 2 seats available at the counter for indoor dining.Service: 4/5The lady behind the counter was very nice.

Prices are reasonable and delivery on time. On the last order, in October 2022, the order was delayed by ~ 30 minutes past the estimated arrival time. I called the restaurant and the person on the other end was apologetic - seems like they had a printer malfunction. In other words, good manners and customer service. The order arrived soon after I called, btw.There are pricier joints around - like Chola (midtown east, Manhattan) - where the food taste better (higher prices as well) and has a more varied menu. But this is a reliable place and sometimes that's all you need."
1177,_GHQh87uXE3Uew-ZnTdm1A,9/14/2021,4 star rating,"Awesome little spot -- bar AND shop... I think the bartender annoyance or irritation others have reported is based upon this concept feeling slightly mis-located. Or, rather, confused tourists wandering aimlessly between Union Square and The High Line kept popping in, looking at the beers as if disgusted or perplexed, asking for directions, then leaving. Almost like a truck-stop souvenir shop. Except they actually have a lot of incredible beers at very reasonable prices, and probably feel unrecognized or unappreciated? Maybe if they were only open at night this wouldn't be such a problem. Except there seem to be quite a few regulars who spend a lot of their time here. To the point that the same few guys were here when we came in at the beginning of our day as when we came in again at the end of our day. So perhaps that aspect could also feel slightly uninviting, since nobody seems to want to make room for new people, because there literally isn't any room. But, it's got good bones, it's got a good spirit, and I really want to like it."

The fish was very fresh and we loved every single bite.

1188,NFE2bRE4gF8Ev70X-mV-QA,6/16/2021,5 star rating,"Oh, just your neighborhood sushi spot that flies fresh fish from Japan on the daily...and closed on Tuesdays. It was a beautiful night in Brooklyn Monday, Eric R.'s and my last night visiting my brother, SIL, and adorable niece. My brother highly recommended we eat here during this trip, and my mom got to have it as takeout when she visited in December. I heard it was really amazing from her, and she is quite picky.We called in advance to make reservations, and were seated outside at a four top with a high chair for my niece. Jeff L. and my SIL recommended the omakase. When I lived in Vegas, some restaurants offered omakase but required a few days' notice (kind of like kaiseki). Here, we just showed up and there were many options. I ordered ""open-ended"" omakase. The server asked me if I had any allergies or dislikes, which I did not. I thought that was amazing because they would not give anyone something they could not eat or did not want to eat.My brother and SIL ordered the kosher style omakase, since my SIL is allergic to shellfish. Eric R. was skeptical of omakase and chose the ""sushi and sashimi dinner"" which still was chef's choice with fresh items. We ordered edamame for the table and kanpyo maki for my niece.Eric R. and I got Sapporo, and my brother ordered iced green tea. The edamame came out hot and salted. My niece enjoyed munching on the kanpyo maki, and it was really cute to watch. Eric R. did get three courses, though he was initially concerned because he thought his first plate was the entire meal. His plate was really beautiful, and even though he told the server he did not like a few fishes, he did not mention oyster so he got one and gave it to me! He also had me try his mackerel to make sure it was something he would like (it was) - he was relieved because he does not usually likes saba sushi.Our platter came out, and two of three were the same for all omakase orders. I wish I could remember all of the options, but in the first round they included kinmedai (which was so good I ordered another piece), chutoro and two other pieces. Our second platter included king salmon, hamachi belly with shishito puree, otoro, and one other piece. For my ""open-ended"" plate which diverged from theirs (I included a photo of their third plate too), I received botan ebi with fried head, Hokkadio uni, seared salmon belly, and one other piece.Eric R. ordered a negitoro handroll, I ordered negihama and salmon skin handrolls, and Jeff L. got a salmon skin handroll and negihama maki. My SIL also ordered several pieces she liked from the omakase, and Eric R. and I both got a kinmedai nigiri to enjoy.We chuckled a bit at the bill because it is not every day that we spend these prices on a meal, but we had a lot to celebrate. The quality was absolutely phenomenal, reminiscent of my visits to Japan and Hawai'i. Itadakimasu!"

Total came to $150 for me, which frankly is still considerably affordable compared to many many omakase restaurants in Manhattan or LA. Fish was fresh, there was good variety, the only piece I did not really enjoy was the Californian uni (I am very particular with uni anyway and tend to prefer Hokkaido).

The sushi is served on a bed of slightly sweet sushi rice; I appreciate that it is not uber sticky and cloying like other places.

1196,NFE2bRE4gF8Ev70X-mV-QA,1/21/2023,2 star rating,"Came here after researching quality sushi in Park Slope/Crown Heights.  We both selected the open omakase.  Overall was quite disappointed for the quality at the price point.  Here are some notes from the experience:o toro - meh quality, unnecessary sauce.  Our pieces were cut to completely different sizeskamasu (trout) and monkfish - Both of these pieces were blow torched and let to sit before arriving to us. The result was lukewarm and congealed fatking salmon with seaweed - salmon was creamy and paired nice with the toasted seaweed, probably the highlightbaby snapper - good quality, ruined by a dollop of lemon sauce on top that overpowered the subtle taste of the fish. Again our pieces were cut to different sizesstriped jack - quality was good, too much ponzo and green onionHokaido uni - no way this couldn't be goodchu toro - again, why slather such a quality piece of fish in sauceW one hot sake, tea, one beer, edamame, and gyoza, it came out to $370 with tip.  The open style omakase was $110 for 12 or 13 pieces and the standard omakase was 9 pieces + a hand roll and almost half the price.  Sure we got a couple of additional premium pieces, but I can't rationalize this price difference. A per piece omakase is supposed to feel special. Our chef was either cranking out pieces for us seemingly as fast as he could or taking long stretches away to prepare orders for the dining room. I understand this is a busy restaurant serving a full dining room, but at these prices I would have expected better.Getting quality sushi for a decent price in New York is difficult, and I was hoping this would be it.  Sadly I was mistaken.  Either shell out more for better or a lot less for 20% worse."

I ordered the grilled salmon with a side of broccoli and rasta pasta. Everything was so good! My food even stayed warm during the delivery. The peppa sauce is real good too! Make sure you add some to your dish to kick it up a notch. The only downside to this place is that the wait time is always long, so be prepared to wait! The food is so worth it though."

Idk if the driver put his hand in on it or not. This is nasty! I'm pretty much paying to get sick from lazy ass workers at Jus fish! When I called the restaurant answered the phone with the TV blearing in the back ground. I guess JusFish working from home too! Package your food correctly! Put a sealing sticker on it.  #JusFishyIsJusNastyDO NOT EAT HERE!

The online menu doesn't match the actual menu; snapper isn't on the online menu but they had it in person. My dad wanted the shark which was on the online menu but they didn't have any more. The food took over an hour; when we inquired about out order, the person said we have a list...okkk seems like it tastes a long time to grill fish. I got grilled salmon, mac n cheese & plantains..everything was dry. The salmon was good once I put the included sauce on top (not sure what it was); mac n cheese was dry: plantains were hard & dry. My dad got the grilled snapper with broccoli & cauliflower, which he really enjoyed. Overall, I wouldn't waste my time on this place again."

I never had broccoli in rasta pasta. No flavor just a little spice. Swear I saw one tomato mixed in with the peppers. The shark burger was so small for $11. Nobody had on a mask but one woman. The whole kitchen was looking at me while maskless every time the door swung open. The guy having the casual conversation on the phone kept his mask on his chin the whole 20 mins we waited for our food. My friend didn't like her food either. She said she prefers the other location."
1207,NFE2bRE4gF8Ev70X-mV-QA,5/25/2018,4 star rating,"Great affordable minority owned business in Flatbush PLG. Jus Fishy prepares your fish jus the way you like it: steamed, grilled, or fried. I have had the salmon a couple of time but most recently I ordered the snapper fried with a side of steamed broccoli and veggie chow mein. The order took awhile but when I got my order I was thoroughly satisfied with the taste and the portion size for only $15. I drizzled a bit of their hot sauce on top (its actually hot unlike most restaurants so be careful) and I was in heaven. I also a corn soup which I wasnt happy with. It was more like chicken soup with a piece of corn in it. They have several different types of fish so don't hesitate to stop by if snapper or salmon isnt your fave."

Beyond the single table and the small space, it seemed like delivery orders for UberEats and the like were prioritized.But once the fish arrived I put aside my skepticism. I got the steamed snapper, which masterfully dished out some citrus-type flavors that made their own statements without overshadowing the fish. The platters come with two sides, and it was a nice surprise that something as substantial as rasta pasta was on the list. I also got cabbage."

I've found the best way to do it is to walk in, order, run some errands or something, come back 30-45 minutes later (even if they tell you it's only going to take 10). If you can handle the absolute atrocious service, this is some of the best fish I've had in nyc."

Ordered 3 items to use the voucher gift. Ordered a Philly Cheesesteak, Cheeseburger and Meatball Parm hero online for pick up.  All three were good and we had no issues with its taste. They tasted as it should. So all in all, no complaints. I guess it fits the bill for a place to grab a quick meal. I feel no surprises is a good thing and a safe bet. If you need a reliable place that's a step or two above a fast food choice, then this is it. I also know that they make really good shakes here but wasn't in a mood for one this time around. The total bill was $40."

We ordered the serious burger served on a brioche bun, fried mushrooms with a free cookie from Grubhub. The burger was pretty decent, soft brioche bun and juicy patty perfectly matched with peanut butter. The fried mushroom is my favorite on menu and it was amazingly delicious."

Shake is in a tiny mason jar but runs $6-$7. Eddie's Sweet Shop, Bareburger, and every diner for 100 miles gives you twice as much for the price.While tasty, they are offering absolutely nothing more than what you can get at virtually any diner in Queens, for less money, and larger portions. I absolutely do not mind paying more for a meal that is above average, but this is just that I'm afraid. For $60 with tip for two I can get a truly spectacular burger from a half dozen better places in the city."

They are quite good at doing what they set out to do, which is give enormous, fully customizable portions of a solid diner style burger. If you come here comparing your experience to gourmet burger places in Manhattan you'll definitely come away disappointed. I recommend going for some outside the box ingredients (this was the first place I tried peanut butter on a burger, a decision that's paid dividends to this day). All the sides I've had here have been tasty and exactly what you would expect from a diner type spot. If you can somehow fit a shake afterwards they're also fantastic, they have as many flavors as you could possibly imagine. The shakes are fairly thin but super flavorful."

If you check the menu, they charge $10 for one waffle and $3 for the chicken: that if I wanted to ""add"" chicken. Chicken and waffles doesn't even come with chicken!!! It's like ordering a burger and then come find out you gotta pay extra for the patty inside.The food is good but the price doesn't the justify the portion. I will not order from cheeburger unless it's a burger - that's the only thing is still good here."

The service was great, we got seated quickly and our appetizers and entrees came out fairly quickly. The fried pickles (even though on the menu it states that it's very salty) It wasn't all that bad, definitely a top 5 contender in the fried pickle game lol. I loved how it was crunchy like chips and not AT ALL soggy, that was a major plus. The burgers were great, just a pretty standard burger. I recommend getting the cheeburger sauce though because that was amazing!! The Milkshakes however could've been a bit more frozen (if I'm nitpicking) but other than that I had a great experience."

Throw it away!  Give me back my money or give me a fresh bagel.  No questions asked - not a big deal.  Scary what some of these corporate type of businesses will offer in certain neighbourhoods.  On another note,  I should not be eating anything from DD.  Sticking to coffee only.........in an emergency."

There's definitely a heroin addict vibe happening as I've heard a lot of loud talking / screaming matches and weirdos hanging by the door or pawing the window.

It had a nice little crowd going Sunday around 4pm and still had a lot of seating. Sadly, there isn't any happy hour on Sundays so we ordered 3 well drinks for $8 each. They were decent drinks.We also ordered the sampler which was good for $13."

I was in there last night watching Monday night football and ordered the Steakhouse Mac and Cheese. The bartender brought me a bowl of greasy cheese slop. It looked like a box of Kraft. I mentioned it to the bartender (very well known) and he says he not making the food. I called to speak to the GM and he was not in, but another manager said she would look into it. I was not offered a replacement, a desert, nothing. I am very disappointed and yeah you know who I am.  The kitchen at this location is terrible. A lot of new workers and workers who obviously don't care about the work products they send out. I have had broccoli that looked like cauliflower, cold, discolored, and mushy. I am going to stop coming here now."

There was a line to call ahead for reservations or walk in to put your name and be in the area if you need to errands at a CVS near by. I ordered their steak house salad and a baked potato and a hot tea. The food wasn't as I remembered and the dressing was tossed into my salad that it made the salad soggy by the time it got to our table. The food isn't horrible but can be better. The waitress was super sweet. She forgot my hot tea so she gave it to us complimentary for the long wait. It could be better but the place was clean and the waitress and the staff was super hospitable.

I am not sure why my waitress could not handle 3 tables. Her coworker (assuming she was her supervisor) had to step in to help. I should have trusted the bad reviews.

The bright purple Frappuccino drink is made of toad's breath, bat warts and lizard scales. ....Well not really.... lolThe ingredients include an orange flavored, purple colored powder for the drink's flavor and color, chia seeds as the bat warts and green sugar as the lizard scales dusted on top of the whipped cream.  It's purple but tastes like oranges... Sort of like an orange creamsicle. The chia seeds gave it a nice crunch. I love holiday themed drinks so I gave it a 8 out of 10. Not too sweet but light & creamy. The downside to the Times Square location is the homeless people sleeping inside. I wanted to sit down as I waited for my Broadway show to start but had to stand outside because there was no room. It's just unacceptable for paying customers."

I only stopped by for a wake me up cup of coffee. The line was of course super long and as slow as the proverbial flow of molasses in January. This, however, was not for lack of efficiency on the part of the staff. The cause was that every office in the area seemed to have sent a ""go-for"" (I felt so sorry for the ""go-fors"") to make or pick up and bring back some really huge take outs for their offices. After having had two cups of coffee, I needed to use the men's room. The restrooms were understandably not just labeled for ""customers only"" but also had combination lock which was a problem. Not only did I have to stand in the long slow line again to speak to a clerk in order to get the combination, but then the number I was given was incorrect. Ugh! So, I was forced to go through the entire long slow line procedure all over again then put up with the delays of the staff figuring out or finding out who had or knew the correct combination number."

Here, the line was painfully slow, and the staff had no sense of urgency. Once I finally got my drink, it was poorly made. Wrong milk (good thing I'm not allergic to dairy milk, but when you pay the extra price for coconut milk, I'd like to get it), and the bitterness of the concentrated chai syrup was evident.

I normally go to the other Starbuck's across from my work because obviously, it's more convenient. Unfortunately, my place was out of my drink. I know now to just order something else and avoid this Starbuck's.Walking in you notice that the store is fairly clean. Music is playing and not too many people waiting for drinks. I ordered my drink and another for a friend. The nest thing that you notice is that the people working behind the counter are extremely loud talking to each other. I was getting really annoyed actually because I was looking at my two drink cups and they were not making them. I waited patiently as I listen to them screaming at each other in a playful manner. (I hope it was playful). But I was getting upset because I was on a break and didn't have time to listen to them shout back and forth.The girl behind the counter says ""are you waiting for something?"" I then pointed to my drink cups and she said ok.Very long story short: I had to have her remake the drink twice because I guy jumped in to make my drink and made it all kinds of wrong. I will definitely make sure that I do not go back to this location. If I want to listen to screaming and get bad coffee I'll go to a nasty coffee shop.

The space is absolutely gorgeous.  It is wide open and goes deep into the building.  There are two floors of seating, something you don't see very often in any coffee shop in Manhattan.  The colors are heavy contrasts between light and dark colors.  Add to that some beautiful photography in a back section and some cute drawings on another wall and there is a sophisticated charm to the decor.  Someone definitely gave this layout a lot of thought.  It felt instantly comfortable and modern all at the same time.  On top of all this the space was very clean.  Not one table had garbage on it and all the surfaces looked like they had been wiped down.I ordered a Chai Latte and it was made very quickly (this was around 6PM on a Friday).  The staff was quick and efficient, though they seemed to be scrambling around a lot behind the counter.  The chai came out great (though a bit frothy compared to other places).I would definitely go back here for a drink if I am in the area.  I was very impressed by my visit."

They ask you to step forward and order, you start speaking and they start giggling with whoever's pregnant next in the back. After they renovated it would've been wise to fire all of the front girls because they don't even try. Bottom line, do NOT come here!"

My only pet peeve is that there aren't any automatic doors or switches. I usually come here with my toddler and sometimes it's difficult to navigate the door with my stroller.

Finally replies with suggestions of a refund or help yourself to any cookies on display to complete the order.  Quite frankly, these suggestions were not acceptable because I needed the cookies I ordered as favors for my guests.  We agreed on a new date to pick up the rest of the order which I did.  I was met by someone that provided me with the rest of the cookies with no apology for the mistake and brushed off because they were very busy.  Where is the common courtesy and professionalism when a business makes a mistake as such.

I had taken a client out to lunch who happens to be 90 years old and hard of hearing. He inadvertently ordered the wrong main course and asked for it to be changed, the owner ran over to our table yelled and threw a fit over the request. In all of my years entertaining I had never seen anything so unprofessional especially from a place supposedly this high end. It was horrifying to say the least and I could tell that the waiter (who is great btw) was incredibly embarrassed. As I was leaving the restaurant I walked over to the owner and let him know that I didn't appreciate his treatment of my elderly client and his response to me was ""this is my house, get out"". With an attitude and treatment of customers like that it won't be his house much longer. Needless to say I won't be recommend or returning to San Pietro ever again."

Truly the best steak in town, far better than Sparks, Keens, Del Frisco and many other well known steakhouses. The secret to order super tender, order the ribeye ""rare plus"" and order the sautéed mushrooms. Amazing combination.What surprised me, I ordered off menu for the kids, pasta with meatballs. Holy smokes, that's the most tender meatballs I've ever had. The pasta is cooked perfectly, the sauce is made perfectly. Best pasta and meatballs I've ever had, even better than some famous Italian restaurants I've been. But the most toughest critic, my kids... they devoured it.

We met some of the nicest people on E 54th Street.

1352,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,7/6/2021,2 star rating,"This was a place I passed by daily and my mom never had Mexican so, why not help support small businesses. Who wants to cook on a hot day anyways. I ordered only and you can schedule time of pick up. Ordered beef empanada, steak enchilada, spicy pork taco and horchata. Fav was the spicy pork taco and the horchata drink. I was surprised the cup size was like a medium when I ordered the small ($3). It tasted great, similar to the one I had in Spain. Beef empanada was dry, couldnt taste much flavor. Steam enchilada was good but not enough cheese. So THIS was why I gave a low rating. The mushroom and avocado burrito had NO avocado. Believe me, I opened it up and checked. Killed my burrito but it proves I was right. Tasted no avocado and opened it after one bite. Unbelievable. Other than that I did like the other foods but now I feel like I have to examine my food on the spot before leaving. Oh and they only gave one thin plastic bag for my order of 6 items, including a drink. Bag started to ripe as I walked down the block.I cant tolerate the fact that i paid a certain amount that was equal to a protein burrito and I didnt get what I paid for. I wanted the mushroom and avocado burrito WITH avocado. I expected it and got NONE. Plus there were very little lettuce. Burrito wasnt plumped/big. Probably would have better gotten burrito from Chipotle. I was eager to try this place and it disappointed me greatly. I dont appreciate not getting what I paid for, especially when it comes to avocado cause I love them. Also the fact you gave me a thin ass shitty bag that was holding 6 items in big containers. If someone lived far, they would have destroyed their food because of the bagging. I dont know if I will be back. Probably for the horchata drink but that's it.  My cravings will go to Chipotle until my anger cools down. But check your food before leaving guys! Make sure you get what you paid for."

The Consome was a bit bland and dry, even with all the green/red sauces it still lacked taste. I basically devour the Birrias and buried it in that gravy sauce. This branch offers online ordering and even gives discounts when you order on their website. I placed my order through the phone and it was still prompt and fast.

She never asks me what I want to eat anymore. Like, um, excuse me ma'am, whatever happened to freedom of speech? What a tyrant. Jk. That's why you bet I was surprised when she decided to order some Mexican food on her own accord.This was our second time here. The first time was unsuccessful. We arrived at 12pm but the restaurant was half-closed and my sister and I were just standing in the streets unsure of what to do when a man walked past us and told us about the restaurant's side door. He was really kind and helped us inquire about the situation. Turns out the chef was stuck in traffic so the kitchen was closed.This time, my sister and I opted for delivery instead. We browsed through their website via the link on Yelp, created an account, paid, and placed the order. They also have an app that my sister later downloaded. Once you place the order, they send a confirmation to your email address which gives an estimated time of delivery (40 mins in our case). It took about 50 minutes for our food to arrive, so the estimate was fairly accurate. The only thing I hate is there's no way of knowing when your food will arrive until it actually arrives (you'll get a call). Anyways, my sister got the Shrimp, Steak, and Chicken Tacos; I got the Chicken Burrito.**[ SHRIMP, STEAK, & CHICKEN TACOS ]From what my sister said, these tacos are delicious! Her favorite is the Steak Taco, followed by the Shrimp, and then the Chicken. She requested no onions in all of her tacos, but somehow, one way or another, in addition to no onions, she also got no cilantro in her Shrimp Taco and no cilantro and radish in her Steak and Chicken Tacos. I guess they forgot?Nevertheless, asides from the fact that the Chicken Taco was slightly on the drier side, the tacos were really good. Warm, full of flavor, and really generous with the ingredients!**[ CHICKEN BURRITO ] I ordered a Chicken Burrito with no beans and no sour cream. Tbh today was a really bad day for Mexican food, but more so, for food in general. I woke up with itchy eyes and nasal congestion, so I couldn't really taste the burrito (ofc that's my problem, not theirs). Guess my allergies really missed me and wanted to pop in and make their presence felt lol.I will say, however, that the chicken really was dry. My sister agreed but I think a fellow Yelper also said the same. Anyways, the Chicken Burrito still was good. I can't say much about the flavor, because of my allergies, but it was packed with ingredients and left me feeling so fulfilled.**[ FINAL THOUGHTS ]One day when my senses are intact, I really want to get the Birria Tacos.  They look so so good and I can't wait to come back and try them, along with some other items on the menu!"

The good:The food was by far some of the best tacos I've had in quite a while. None of the frills a lot of the modern ""taquerias"" try to wow you with. Just good ol' tacos and a fair price. I had the virtual tacos and chorizo nachos, and it was definitely a hearty meal overall. The ambiance as well felt like I was back in Mexico eating in a local taqueria. They even had fresh horchata and juices! The okay:I'm always a stickler for ambiance, and I'd have to say the ambiance here was a bit strange to me. I love how festive they set the place up, but between the TV playing Mexican music (which I actually really liked) and the Christmas tree playing music box renditions of Christmas songs, I felt like it was too much sensory overload that it took away from the overall experience. Also, the seating looked like a modge podge of old furniture. Overall homemade taqueria stayed true to its name. The food felt homemade and tasted great and the service was very homely and friendly. I would definitely come back."

1357,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,5/16/2021,3 star rating,"The food here was ok/good, but I've had better. There were little pineapples in the al pastor tacos which did help. The place is nice and clean, service is friendly, attentive but the tacos didn't make me say, ""I will definitely be back here"" so I probably won't. That's not to say I don't recommend them. If you're hungry you can eat here with confidence that it won't upset your tummy and will definitely fill it. These tacos are very filling."
1358,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,1/5/2021,4 star rating,"Easy take out ordering system directly from their website. It did take an extra 20 mins from what it said in the email (total 40 mins) because they had just opened when we ordered.The tacos were delicious and weren't as salty as some other neighborhood places. They were still intact (not too soggy) after a 20 min drive home. The double tortilla and sauces on the side helped. My favorite was the steak taco (their green sauce is very spicy, use sparingly). Fish taco was hearty and the chorizo one was full of flavor. The chicken avocado salad came with a whole one on a bed of lettuce and generous chicken pieces. The lemon dressing was pretty sour. The beef empanada was decent, freshly fried but not as flavorful inside (probably good that it wasn't packed with salt). Overall a very well priced neighborhood joint for takeout!"

They follow guidlines with spacing. The food was delicious. (Steak, pollo, Al Pastor, and Birra tacos with consume, and tortas)  It does not compare to take out, like most places you MUST eat the food fresh. I came here last year a month or two after they opened and comparing to then, they have definitely improved. I have had many great experiences and I'm happy to say this is definitely one of those great ones.Highly recommend eating and chilling here. If you're in the neighborhood, come through and enjoy this gem!"

1363,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,1/8/2023,5 star rating,Breakfast go-to spot in the city. Their almond croissants are my favorite and the chèvre scrambled eggs are phenomenal. This spot is perfect for an early morning espresso and good company. I came here during my last visit to NYC with a friend and sat outdoors with some breakfast to share and it was perfect. Service is always great and if it's not too busy you'll be seated without a reservation easily. Don't miss out on this gem!

The interior is designed with a French theme, with menu items written in French and wine selections displayed on a mirror on the wall.We ordered an Americano and a dirty chai oat milk latte, both of which were satisfying. The main dishes we tried were the Croque Madame and Eggs with Smoked Salmon. The Croque Madame consisted of Gruyère cheese, classic ham, and a sunny side egg, while the Eggs with Smoked Salmon were served with eggs, capers, and salmon on a slice of bread.Although portion sizes were small, the quality of the food was good. The atmosphere was lively and bustling, but it could get noisy. Overall, Buvette is a charming and casual spot for brunch with a French twist."

Buvette has been on my yelp bookmarks for who knows how long and I am so glad to say we finally tried it!We ordered:Fresh squeezed orange juice - while insanely expensive ($11), the orange juice was delicious. It was so pulpy, sweet, and refreshing!Croque Monsieur - my favorite of the meal! The edges of the cheese crusted perfectly, the insides were melty and the ham was chopped for easy eating, and it was overall just so yummy. It was very bready, but also very filling, and the pickles were perfect to cut through the heaviness.Saumon Fumé - the smoked salmon on this dish was really good but other than that, it wasn't that special to me. The eggs were kind of plain but it went well with the saltiness of the salmon. This restaurant is a bit pricey, but ultimately you're also paying for the atmosphere and the aesthetic. And the good service!"

1368,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,11/29/2022,3 star rating,"This place seems to be popular for brunch, but I went for dinner with a few friends and decided to split several dishes:- Escargots: 6 large pieces cooked in garlic, parsley & butter. The melted garlic butter was great for dipping.- Cassoulet: a small bowl (more like a ""cup"" in terms of portion size) filled with tarbais beans and maybe three pieces of meat (duck, pork, and sausage I think). Standard comfort food. - Betteraves: just your regular beets... the horseradish creme fraiche went well with the beets, but this is not a must order dish.- Artichauts a la grecque: artichoke braised in wine, garlic & mint. Not super memorable.- Brandade de morue: house salt cod with olive oil, cream & garlic. This was probably our favorite. Amazing with bread.- Three glasses of wine (friends asked for recommendations from our server)Came out to around $50pp. Dishes here are super small. Not sure if I would return for dinner as the only thing I would want to have again is the Brandade and maybe the escargots."

My husband and I went in around 930am on a Thursday & got immediately sat at the bar. We had quick service and friendly smiles from the bartenders who were eager to help assist us. We had a hard time selecting what to eat as everything sounded wonderful. We ended up with the jambon cru + the chevre. The jambon cru is something i am not dreaming about and will go back in the neat future to have again.

Opted to sit at the bar for more table space as the tables for two are quite tiny (like being in Paris). Had the Brussels sprouts and the steak tartare to start. The tartare had lots of cornichons that gave it a slight tang, I enjoyed it. The steamed eggs would be a little bland without a salty element so the smoked salmon helped the dish. The croque forestier was great, the end he's were crispy (cheese, mushrooms and bread) while the inside was soft and gooey. The crème brûlée was good, the little crispy crepe/ wafer they gave was sooo good with it. The sugar was nice and caramelized. For drinks, the mulled wine was delicious and sweet. The tamarind sing was light and refreshing, I think it's like a tamarind spritz. The boulevardier was quite strong. The absinthe frappe had strong fennel like flavor.The service was great. The servers constantly refilled our water glasses, cleared our tables( a must because of the small table size) and checked in."

We've also tried their chocolate mousse since apparently they don't offer wine and cheese until dinner time. Today we stopped in at 2p and opted for some red wine and chocolate mousse. In one word, perfection!!!! They top the chocolate mousse with fresh made slightly sweetened whipped cream. The pinot we selected paired well with the chocolate. Buvette takes reservations but we typically wander up around opening and they always greet us with a smile and welcome us in. We like to sit outside as it's SO pleasant and fun to people watch. They do have warmers to keep you toasty if you are worried about getting cold.  The ambiance inside is typically French. What's that mean? Idk...it reminds me of a bistro I've visited in Paris only this place is bigger, nicer and in my favorite city of all times!!  I'd like to add a note, going back tomorrow night for cheese and I saw they have hot spiced wine (like gluwine in Austria)!!! I mention cheese yet again because they have an amazing selection...just have to go at the right hour which I suspect is dinner hours..."

1373,fuLGTn6H_BLEa1ahGGzebQ,12/29/2015,5 star rating,"Life is simple. Wake up, go to work, go home or don't. Connect with friends or find your way on your own. These are the things we do so often we forget sometimes the surroundings that add the color to our daily routines. I've always judged a good new haunt by the morning after. For me the memory trigger or talisman is a book of matches. When I find a good place, when I have that lightbulb moment that the environment I'm in deserves a return visit... I look for a reminder. Something to remember the moment. For me it's a matchbook. It doesn't matter if you smoke or not. I own candles, I live in old buildings with gas stoves that have faulty ignitions. I take morning constitutionals. So a book of matches is something I will always find a use for. So this morning when I woke and reached into my pocket to find a new book of sulfur, before I opened and struck I looked down and saw the the name of a bar I had just discovered. Milos is a simple place. One that makes me proud to live in what I consider the best city in the world.  Living in Brooklyn (in Bushwick) at this moment is even better. There are endless opportunities for eats and drinks and the paths that take us to them reveal hidden gems along the way. Milos is by far one of those places. Walking up to the Christmas lighted awning and opening the door to a dimly lit warmth of an old school bar was the breath I needed in a cold long day. Happily greeted by the bartender while great indie music played in the background. The music wasn't loud just enough to disguise conversation but loud enough to enjoy. Milo's layout is perfect. A nice solid bar when you enter. In the railroad layout the next two rooms hold pinball machines. The first room holding some classic 2000's titles like Shadow with Alec Baldwin in the face. In the next room thee are three incredible old school 'no title' machines. Ones that make you want to play. I mean who doesn't want to try a go at flippin when you see Jack Bot, Comet and Grand Lizard! These are the kind of machines that have not only amazing 'Tommy' play but also have incredible sounds and lights. The selection of beers is great. A little bit of everything. The prices are right and offer great cheap beer-shot options and local crafts. The kicker for me is the option for food. Now let's be clear. This isn't a bar with a kitchen or staff to cook. It's a one man bartending affair. And for the meal my girlfriend and I got that speaks volumes. We split a veggie samosa with two great sauces. My girlfriend had a vegan patty burger and I had a Chicago style hot dog. The hot dog was spot on. I lived in Chicago for 6 years so I know what a good dog is. The perfect selection of bar food paired with great beers and and great entertainment. This is what makes life simple. The bars name comes from that of a pet. Something I have found to be a trend lately in business naming and even though at this moment I don't own a pet... I have come to find if your place is named after your 'lil best friend' I become your new best friend. So if your looking for your new go to spot, Milos is it!"

I was really into this place until they played some John Cale followed by some late 70's Bob Dylan, then I became extremely into this place.Suddenly, if you live in this area, you have no shortage of bar options. It's insane how fast bars are popping up around here. There is a housing bubble and there is a bar bubble, and when the bar bubble pops I hope Milo's Yard remains standing. On the housing side, I'll have to keep my fingers crossed.There's an actual yard too, but for now I think they're still working on the permit."

Came on a sunday night with two of my friends (girl and a guy) (5/19/19) and it started out fine, but toward closing time I noticed the people next to me had half a beer and a another FULL beer in front of them. I had half a jack and coke. I didn't want to ask for a full drink so i POLITELY asked the bartender if he could top off my drink (obviously was going to pay for it) and he rudely proceeded to complain about how we didn't tip him enough (didn't even know my friend had closed out the tab, also my friend had told him that the tip he left on credit card wasn't going to be the only one) so NO he wasn't going to serve me. I was so shocked by his tone and response because as a bartender, that is highly unprofessional. We hadn't even fully closed out or left for him to assume that we wouldn't tip for our own drinks (only one out of three of us had tipped) the way he snapped at me was highly uncalled for considering I asked very respectfully and he proceeded to throw in my face how he ""gave us free shots"" when he really only gave one person a shot while two of us went to the bathroom. I can keep going about the interaction but I think you get the point. Don't be in the service industry if you don't know how to properly interact with your customers."

1383,RH6kTt81G4OdWP603LnoDQ,9/13/2021,5 star rating,The best tasting jerky I've ever had! It's nice and charred but still soft. I love the smoky taste. I bought only 1/2 lb the first time and finished within 2 days. I went back the next week and got 1 lb. It's a bit on the pricey side but well worth it. I spent $24.95 for a little over 1 lb of pork jerky. I wish they would deliver though.
1384,RH6kTt81G4OdWP603LnoDQ,8/16/2019,5 star rating,"If I lived in NYC I would hesitate to write a review as I would want all the jerky to myself.   Yes, I don't want to share or have to wait for them to make more.  Everyday they are making fresh jerky and sometimes they run out.  One guy ordered 20 lbs, that's right 20 lbs and pretty much wiped them out of what they had.  Hey we bought around 8 lbs ourselves and we are hauling them back to Hawaii.  You may ask what's so special about this jerky???  This is Malaysian style jerky, it is not the hard tough jerky that most American's are used to that take a long time to chew and then you find the fat that doesn't ever break down and you either have to swallow or spit it out.  This is tender, very soft and very flavorful jerky.  You can get pork, beef, chicken, curry beef, or shrimp jerky. I don't know about the others (as they didn't have any when we went) but the pork and beef, you can get it either in regular or spicy.  Don't worry the spicy isn't that spicy at all.  It was kind of mild if you ask me.  If you are traveling and taking the jerky with you like we are, they can vacuum seal it for you.  It may not be the cheapest jerky, but it surely is one of the best that I have tried.  You pay for what you get I say.  BTW IT IS CASH ONLY, so bring your hard cold green backs or go to a ATM and withdraw your life savings and get some today!"

The location was a little tricky to find b/c the GPS kept throwing me off - turns out it was on the opposite side of the street where the pin told me to go.Initially, I was just going to get 1lb of spicy beef and call it a day but the ladies working there were super nice, spoke Cantonese and talked me into buying more, which I totally did and had no regrets. So I ended up getting 1/2 lb of regular beef and 1/2 lb of pork per their recommendation as well. Price-wise, jerky typically isn't cheap to come by and it seems like $25/lb seemed pretty accurate for decent jerky. The fact they vacuum seal their jerky makes it so easy to bring back home.Their jerky is made fresh daily and super soft, seasoned extremely well, and even after a few days, you still get those crisp edges. When I brought it back home to share with the fam, they were blown away too!Now if only they were willing to scale up and consider shipping their jerky, I swear they would flourish so well. Alas with COVID, it'll be a long while before I get a chance to go back to NYC for this mouthwatering jerky."

I went for the basic beef jerky this time around.A couple of key things to point out if you're a first-timer:1)  A tiny storefront on Canal selling only jerky. Like, you step in, and you're at the counter. It's tiny. Just the way I like a good hole in the wall joint for sure. 2) 2 minute walk to the F train.3) The jerky is delicious but a bit pricey. 4) They will try to up sell you. Every. Single. Time. Which is fine... I'm not sure how much money they can actually make on a daily basis selling only jerky. And during COVID. 6) btw, yes - they're openIs there better jerky in the city? Could very well be... but this spot is familiar, quick, easy, convenient, in a cool part of town and gets the job done every time."

Located in Manhattan's Chinatown, this hole in the wall joint puts out jerkies that are uniquely different and can appease novices and jerky enthusiasts alike.This Malaysian take on jerky is tender, sweet, chewy and savory. Unlike its American counterpart, which is better known texturally as a dried and chewy junk food. Beef jerky is a great alternative snack to Chips or Chocolate! They feature six signature jerkies. Beef, Chopped Beef, Pork, Chicken, Shrimp, and Curry Beef. All unique in taste but, the original beef is always a true contender. My personal favorite!

The combination of everything just went together perfectly. There was a little heat from the spicy mayo, sweetness from the mango, creaminess from the avocado & it all was perfect.

I wish that the rice had a little bit more flavor, but everything else was very tasty.We also tried their peanut butter cupcake and chocolate chip cookie (both vegan) and they were decent as well.Overall, this is a great little spot in an area with limited food options.

I have eaten at this place three days in a row, and I am already thinking about my lunch today :).When you walk in, you see a cash register with the kitchen in the back, pastry displayed filled with yummy looking pastries! They have a table in the first room as well, but the main dining are is in the room next to it. Long communal tables make it easy to make friends if you come alone! They have a coat hanger along the walls which is a big plus.The menu is simple. They mark all the vegan dishes for you (you dont have to be the annoying customer asking if it's vegan), separate menu for beer and wine and a small specials sign on the table. We have tried the hummus and pita, and oh my god! It was unbelievably good. The pita bread was warm, puffy, crunchy on the outside and super soft on the inside. Their hummus comes seasoned with paprika, parsley, olive oil on top, we even had left over hummus for our sandwiches. Oh, and it comes with Harissa hot sauce.I always get a falafel sandwich-can't go wrong with that. It is served with a mixed greens salad and two pickles! The sandwich is cut in half, each side is topped with onion, tomato, cucumber and tahini on top. On the bottom of the sandwich is hummus, then falafel. It is out of this world. Definitely one of the best falafel sandwiches I have ever had.My boyfriend tried the last sandwich on the menu, She-something :P. It was served with two pickles and a pepperoncini. The sandwich had onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, soft boiled egg and tahini. Soooo good, especially once the yolk mixed with all the veggies. We also tried the shawarma sandwich with seitan, delicious, but probably wouldn't get again. Their beers go from $3-$6, I had Pilsner and it was $5. They offer bottled drinks- Pilot kombuchas $6, San Pellegrino $2, and I saw they had cream soda, coke, etc. Our bill came down to $33 with the drinks + tip. Very cheap. Right off the Morgan stop on the L, very easy to find. The bathroom was clean. Staff was friendly, and I really enjoyed the calming music! I ordered a delivery which came on time, everything was correct, and they added a side of hot sauce in the bag! Just a heads up- the delivery c charge is high, $4 I believe. I highly highly highly recommend this place. It looks like they actually care about the food they serve, I wasn't worried that my food touched any dairy(I am allergic) and everything seemed very clean."

We chose this place due to some Mediterranean cravings and found it on google maps. I am personally writing a review on the Falafel Sandwich and grape leaves that I ordered. The food wasn't amazing, nor was it bad. I don't think it was seasoned that well as it was almost on the bland side. I do like the selections but I don't think it's worth the price for the quality. The grape leaves, forgot to take a pic, were also just ok. Overall score would be 6/10."

We ended up here by chance (lucky us) and if I were a local I'd be checking into this place weekly! Another bonus is that this gem was significantly cheaper than anywhere I had gone in my 3 day visit to Brooklyn! My gf and I shared the pickles and olives, tabuleh, the masabacha hummus plate, and the seitan sandwich.  The pita, the pita, the pita. Omg. So soft, so warm, so perfect, so pita! The hummus was solidly one of the best I've ever had, if not ever. The chorizo seitan sandwich was also top notch. The seitan was so well executed I felt immediate sadness in realizing that I had to share this dish. Our friends loved the grape leaves as well as their hummus and sandwich.If it's not clear by now, this place is a must try. You'll love it.  Just remember, the pita, the pita, the pita."

Maybe I wasn't super hungry, but it did fill me up. The bread was really good.

Also FYI I only order their chicken and shrimp dishes here could not speak to the pork or beef as I have not tried those. Just like any other Chinese restaurant it is a hit or miss with the items but overall their food is good and always hits the spot for a cheat night. I have tried the shrimp with broccoli, Singapore mei fun (sans pork), and vegetable FR with shrimp. What's even better than the food is the takeout service. There is a petite older lady at the register and I swear she probably makes an adorable grandmother. She always smiles and is always friendly. I don't know what that review says about bad service, maybe it was a one time bad experience. Either-way I live near here, if you are new to the neighborhood and need a good lunch or late night food item : they are open till 12, this is your spot.

The dumplings are HUGE, delicious, and not greasy; the ""small"" orange chicken meal was spilling out of the container they gave me so much.  Not a bad $11 order.  Will definitely be hitting up Annie from now on for my Chinese fix!  Don't be lazy - get yourself some cash and order from here."

We were thrifting in the area and, as budget bound college students, we were looking for tasty, cheap eats. The vibe of this place was amazing -- very small and cozy with great ambience. The service was slow, but it didn't detract from the experience for us as we weren't in a rush and we happy to just hang out in the booth. We ordered a variety of things, including sushi and ramen. I had the spicy pork ramen. The broth was rich but not really all that spicy, I wish it would've been a little more. It was a good sized portion and I think that the price was reasonable from what I am coming to know about the NYC food scene as a new arrival. It definitely wasn't anything super special, but I definitely could find myself coming here again, as the vibe is great and the lady working the front counter was super nice!

The waitresses have no respect and approach with a level of aggressiveness that made me not hungry anymore. We waited 15 min to order and there were only 2 other people in there. The waitress doesn't understand the $15 dollar minimum concept- we kept asking if it was $15 minimum per table or per person and she just kept insisting if it was $15 minimum we had to pay cash. But the total combined for the table was more than $15 and we were splitting. I don't know which restaurant doesn't allow you to split food. The waitress just kept slamming down this piece of paper that said $6 on it and left for us to look at it for some reason. She came back saying we needed to leave because the kitchen was busy and ... once again there were only two people in there.

The staffs are very nice and the drinks are prep very quickly (note: this is based on every visit there wasn't a long line).My usual is either the red bean with fresh milk (Horizon Whole Milk) and the Grapefruit green tea. The red bean with fresh milk which is a very typical red bean drink you can usually get with a more quality taste to it (I'm thinking maybe it's the Horizon milk they use), it also set so no changes can be made with sugar, ice or size. I also like the grapefruit green tea but it does get a bitter from the grapefruit skin and the tea flavor. The only down side for me is the store is very small so it's a quick grab and go (so no hang out here!)  and the drinks can get pricey it's usually around $7-$8 but most bubble tea prices are getting there."

The inside was small, but modern and beautiful. The manager, I believe, took my order and I loved how he recommended sugar and ice levels for each of my drinks. I ordered the Passion Fruit Green Tea ($6.25) with Less Ice and 70% Sugar and the Hojicha Latte with Pearls ($7.25) with Less Ice and 50% Sugar. The price was steep, but the cups were tall for its large size. The layers were everything, making the drinks look super sleek. My boyfriend noted his Passion Fruit Green Tea had extra sour seeds compared to other places. For my Hojicha, the fresh tea from the milk tea is prominent here, and I enjoyed that roasted taste. But both our drinks felt watered down despite having less ice. I actually wish they recommended a 70% sugar level for my drink as it was really bland, but I am thankful they are looking out for my health. The bubbles were the mini bubbles kind, and they were pretty decent.  The authentic fresh tea taste is a nice supplement and adds an element of uniqueness to the range of other bubble tea chains nearby. I would go back to try their other drinks, although shamelessly up the sugar level next time."

There are also bites of passion fruit seeds included in the drink! You can't go wrong with many of the options here.Since they are new, service might be a bit slow and they're also quite busy handling online orders on top of in-person orders.

Our server was quick, very friendly and super attentive. The only negative was the portion size of their beef. It was tiny compared to everything else. It was delicious but just not a lot for the price of the dish. This is the only reason I'm giving them a 4 stars  It is also not a cheap eats place but a great spot for authentic and delicious Szechuan Chinese food."

1454,L5ZsbTGT1G52p11pNf0EXg,2/23/2023,5 star rating,One of the best Northern Chinese restaurant in NYC . The ambiance is elegant and sanitary in midtown in the design center district. If one want spicy they do that well and present the food elegantly and authentically. Plenty kept all the midtown eastsiders with deliveries and excellently prepared spicy dishes and fed us through the winter and pandemic. But what I beginning to understand is they do non spicy dishes just as well. Sometimes when you don't feel like eating spicy. Look into their menus and you will be surprised. Lately I find they make the best Beef with Broccoli in the area. I appreciate good cut of beef and wok fresh broccoli. This is a New York City dish and I'm proud to recognize it being an authentic wok fresh experience. Takeout their Shredded pork with sweet miso and scallions. I fix it with just plain cold noddles. Or just eat it in lettuce pockets. Or Stir-fried beef with scallion and sweet miso the same way. Braised pork belly with chestnut or with baby bak choy. Must try crispy whole fried fish fillet with pine nuts and sweet vinegar sauce ( their specialty)Most of all they delivery all these dishes to the comfort of your homes and offices. Thank you Plenty.

Amazes me that make some dishes so well, because I've also cooked most of this menu with pretty great (but still inferior) results.Today was another experience altogether. Did they lose their chef? Two of three dishes were so bad as to be inedible (total waste). So here's the dets:L1. Spicy Fish Filet Lunch (5/5 stars)Same as last Monday. Perfect score. Fresh soft tofu, some pickle on top. Really great dish.L14. Amazing Chicken Lunch (0/5 stars)Inedible. Rubery chicken with glupy sauce tasted like vinegar added to hot and sour sauce. No spice or heat at all and not even close to what was described.L16. General Tso's Chicken Lunch (0/5 stars)Inedible. Huge pieces of deep fried chicken with glupy massively sweet sauce tasted like hot and sour sauce. Again, no spice or heat at all and not even close to what was described.I've been coming here better part of 20 years, but I guess that's over :(PS - if you can place me in touch with the chef that used to be there, I'll gladly revise this review."

1506,QUBhr1vPMbcmMzvFQJPcLg,5/31/2021,4 star rating,"Had a romantic dinner at Convivium Osteria on Friday night. Excellent and inspired dishes in one of the most beautiful dining areas I could imagine.Quality: Had a lovely dinner at Convivium Osteria. I find that we rarely go out for Italian, and this was a wonderful reminder of how delicious specialty Italian dishes can be. Our meal started with a very good Burrata, served with large slices of heirloom tomatoes, and a fine but unexciting Polpo. For pastas we first had the Gnudi, a fluffy ricotta and spinach based pasta with a wonderful cheese based sauce. And the very unique Ravioli, which had green apple, ricotta, and cinnamon served with a duck ragu. A sweet and savory combination, which may not be for everyone, but something I would order every time. For our mains, I selected the Coniglio, which was braised rabbit served with polenta crostini. It still had that gamey taste, but they paired it well with different elements to prevent it from being abrasive. However, the Agnello, a pistachio crusted roasted rack of lamb, was the winner of the night. Incredibly cooked and the crust was outrageous, among the best lamb I have ever had.Quantity: We ordered more than we needed and managed to finish it all. The  dishes are all a good size, but I think a pasta and a main for each person is the correct portion for dinner.Value: $16 for the Burrata. $17.50 for the Polpo. $23 for the Gnudi. $24 for the Ravioli. $29 for the Coniglio. $34 for the Agnello.Ambiance: Convivium Osteria is located at the northern end of Park Slope. They currently have a very nice outdoor setup, but with the rain it was completely empty. When you walk inside they have a rustic dining area. A small bar near the front, old chandeliers, and lots of wine on display. What I was not expecting was to be led to the middle of the restaurant and down a set of stairs to the wine cellar basement. It is an amazing space, which both keeps the wines chilled and provides the perfect backdrop for either a large private gathering or small romantic meal. The brick walls and gated fences, enhance the look and feel. The only thing to keep in mind is it will be a little chilly. The music was traditional pop and then a lot of Buena Vista Social Club, both good choices.Crowd: Reservations are recommended, but not always required. On a cool and rainy Friday, when their outdoor dining area was not a viable option, they were turning folks without reservations away. The restaurant itself is very nice and the wine cellar basement is perfect for a romantic evening.Service: Excellent service from the friendly staff. The meal was paced perfectly and I appreciated the recommendations and guidance with the menu.Parking: Limited street parking in the area."

We were the first people seated for the evening, so initially the room was empty except for us and wait staff. However, no one came to take our drink order for about 10 minutes - and that was after I flagged someone down. The wine was delicious, and the wait staff was attentive about water refills. The waiter had trouble with English, so we could not understand most of what he was explaining for the specials. We ordered the squid ink linguine with shrimp and the whole sea bass. The flavors were very good; however, the shrimp came with tails and peels on, so we had to eat the pasta and then unpeel the shrimp with our hands - nothing like leaving a meal with seafood smelling fingers. The sea bass flavor was great, but I ended up having a bone lodged down in my throat which I had to extract in the bathroom - I'll refrain from the details. We had asked for the fish to be de-boned. When I informed maybe the manager (?), she was very nice and apologetic, and gave us our dessert on the house. The dessert was apple pie - tasted like a cookie with applesauce filling.  Wish I had seen the review about all the cockroaches- never would have come."

A sense of cheer and a little bit of hope this Valentine's Day as we came to enjoy a meal indoors complete with wine. Lunch felt particularly cozy as we started with the- Burrata - tricolore salad - stuffed quail (the highlight here as it was deboned, stuffed with sausage AND cooked to perfection) Duck ravioli was stuffed with cinnamon and apple topped with a duck ragu. The flavor of the duck didn't quite make it through but the ravioli was amazing. The bursts of sweetness combined with the saltiness of the meat sauce struck a good balance. Lamb was cooked well with a wine reduction but I felt it could've used a bit more seasoning. Bites without an ample amount of sauce fell a bit flat. All in all, for a comeback, Convivium lived up to its name.  4/5: solid Italian favorites, welcome back to indoor"

Such a warm, romantic space for a perfect date! It is a rather small space, but they do have another room downstairs, which can be used for a private event. We had a few appetizers to share; Burrata con Pomodoro e Basilico, and Ravioli di Mele. Burrata dish was fresh and tasty, refreshing on a hot, steamy day. Ravioli had a nice sweetness to it, packed with flavor!We also had their infamous Carciofo alla Romana, which is a Braised Artichoke. It was unique and impressive. The heart was almost creamy, melt in your mouth. They had a few special of the day, and one of them was lasagna. We didn't order it, but we got a small sample, and it was soooooo good!  For main, I chose Spigola al Forno, a 'Whole' Mediterranean Sea Bass It came out beautiful! One of the owners, Michelle, filleted it for me right there. The first bite of the fish gave me such joy...it was absolutely delicious! We enjoyed this dish very much! My hubby went with Agnello in Crosta di Pistacchio, a Sicilian Pistachio Crusted Roasted Rack of Lamb. It had a great crunchy exterior with plump and juicy inside. Packed with flavor, tender and very satisfying. We ended with Tiramisù and Torta di Cioccolato. It was one of the best Tiramisù and flourless chocolate cake I've ever had! We had an amazing dinner here, I am so happy to have discovered this restaurant! Everything we had was superb, we enjoyed them all from the first bite to the last. Our main server, Valentine, took a great care of us. If you want to have some authentic, delicious food with family and friends, or have a very romantic date, this might be the perfect spot for you!"

In other words, this is the real thing, not the Americanized version. Our only mistake is that we came for drinks and desserts after having dinner in another place. We had Aperol  Spritz- about 2 each. The best drink for a hot summer night post COVID, outdoor dining.  We had two gelatos, hazelnut and pistachio. WOW. The hazelnut was like eating frozen nutella and the pistachio was absolutely amazing, delicate, flavorful, creamy yet not heavy. Delicious. My dessert was on the savory side... yes, just didn't feel like something sweet. I had an appetizer that I never heard of nor tasted before: Shaved artichoke hearts with shaved parmigiano and olive oil. That was an amazing surprise in every bite. It was crisp,  lightly salted, and you could taste the quality of the EVOO, but it wasn't greasy,  and the parmigiano of the highest quality.  A day later, as I am writing this review, I still have the delicate, superb taste in my mouth, making it watery again... :) This one came with bread and olives in olive oil to the table... the best quality of olives and olive oil... again! Service was amazing. Attentive and friendly and so welcoming and relaxing. Some places these days, make you feel you should rush so that more business could come in. Not here. Taking your time, the Italian way.As I said initially, our only mistake was that we didn't have dinner here (and not because our diner wasn't good). So we definitely will come again. P.S. Because of COVID, they sanitize the restroom between users. That was impressive to me, as I didn't expect that, as the lady informed me I'll have to wait for her to sanitize before I go in. So... extra point for cleanliness!"

You got an appetizer, entree and dessert with a drink. The service was quick and the drinks were extremely flavorful. The entree though was mild it still was a lil spicy for me but I honestly can't tolerate any spice at all. The dessert was like a wafer with ice cream and all the good stuff.

We ordered:Murtabak ($18) - Malaysian-Indian savory pancake that was stuffed with a flavorful beefSatay Ayam ($13) - Indonesian chicken satay with a delicious peanut sauceHainanese Chicken Rice ($26) - Juicy, tender chicken that is served with rice that was steeped in chicken brothChar Kway Teow + Beef ($22) - Flat rice noodles that are similar to pad see ewLaksa ($22) - interestingly served with both egg and thin rice noodles, which provided good texture, broth was also deliciousBak Kut Teh ($25) - comforting rich pork rib soup with a Chinese fried dough stickThere is still a good amount of the menu we didn't try - I'm excited to come back and eat more!"

I arrived a little earlier than my friends so I sat at the bar and had the Lychee Rose cocktail which was delicious. Once my friends arrived we were immediately seated at our table. We started with the Murtabak roti for our appetizer which was super flavorful. We then decided to ordered 3 other dishes to share. We ordered the Laksa, the Sambal Fried rice with shrimp and the Nasi lemak. Everything was delicious and pretty good portions. We were definitely stuffed by the end of the meal. We also ordered the Archipel cocktail which came in a beautiful peacock vessel and was light on fire. It was beautiful and very pretty for social media but just not my kind of drunk. It was a bit too smoky and sour for my taste. Overall, delicious food, great ambience, friendly staff, and good vibes. I would definitely come back here and try some of their other food and drinks."

My friend and I came in for an early dinner on Sunday - really empty at the time, but filled up rather quickly, so make sure to get a reservation in advance.For the two of us, we ordered the roti prata, nasi lemak, and mee goreng to share. Roti was warm and a perfect mix of crispy and fluffy: a very nice way to start off our meal. Nasi lemak was fantastic - the whole plate felt very carefully put together, one ingredient at a time. Egg was nicely-cooked, beef tender and flavourful, even the rice perfectly fragrant, and with a very generous helping of sambal on the side to give everything a kick. Mee goreng was great, too - noodles were tasty with a yummy tangy/spicy tomato (?) sambal sauce, and I really liked the crispy potato strings as garnish as well.It was such a pleasant surprise to find such authentic yummy Singaporean food in the neighbourhood (although perhaps not the most Singaporean prices... but this is NYC, what can you expect?) - and I hope to be back again soon!"

We ordered the roti prata and salty egg prawns as appetizers, and the dipping sauce for the roti prata was amazing. The prawns were super crispy and large.

The dessert here is AMAZING!!! Make sure to get the mango dessert."

From the moment I stepped inside, I was struck by the beauty of the restaurant - it was a true oasis from the hustle and bustle of the city with lots of greenery and dim lighting. The staff were incredibly helpful and had great recommendations for both food and drinks.I started off with a cocktail called the Geylang District, which was absolutely delicious. It had a fruity flavor but wasn't too sweet and was beautifully presented. For appetizers, I tried the vegetable dumplings, calamari singapura, and satay ayam - all were amazing. My favorite was the vegetable dumplings and the sauce it came with. Although the chicken satay was a very close second.For my main dish, I decided to try the Singapore-style char kway teow with chicken from my server's recommendation. The sauce was not too overpowering, and it had the perfect amount of spice without being overwhelming. My friends ordered the curry asam and ayam goring and they absolutely loved it.I had an amazing experience at this Singaporean restaurant. The food was delicious, the drinks were great, and the staff was incredibly helpful. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a true taste of Singapore in a beautiful and welcoming environment. Everything I tried exceeded my expectations!"

I was amazed by the aesthetics and vibes here. The exterior and interior were gorgeous. No one was sitting outside the day I went since we were in the middle of a heat wave. Since I went with a large group, I was able to try multiple dishes on the Restaurant Week Menu along with other menu items.From the Starters, I had Satay Ayam (chicken satay with peanut sauce, pickled onion and cucumber), Tahu Goreng (fried tofu, peanut sauce, kicap manis, potato crisps, bean sprout, and cucumber), Singapura Calamari (crispy battered, topped with pepper, garlic, five spice, and bell pepper), and Curry Puffs. I really enjoyed the Satay Ayam and Tahu Goreng! Even though the Satay Ayam seems pretty predictable and basic, they executed it well. Tender, flavorful meat on sticks! The Tahu Goreng was surprisingly more elaborate than I thought. I love fried tofu and there was good seasoning and garnish on it.For the Main Courses, I had the Nasi Lemak (coconut rice, served with curry beef, sambal anchovies, sunny side eggs, fresh cucumber, achar, salted peanuts with sambal shrimps and shrimp cracker), Singapore Noodle(thin rice noodle cooked in curry paste, an iconic Singapore dish with beansprout, chive, onion, carrot), Laksa (spicy egg & thin rice noodle in a rich curry coconut milk broth, laksa leaves, cucumber, tofu puffs and bean sprouts), and Hainanese Chicken Rice, (poached chicken served with rice steeped in chicken stock, soy, ginger, chili). I would advise you to skip the Hainanese Chicken. It was dry and not very flavorful. The Lasi Lemak was good and filling; I had to pack the rest to-go. As for the desserts, I tried Milo Ice Cream and Kaya Toast. I was under the impression that Kaya Toast was a breakfast food? The bread was broken into pieces and they were hard and dry. I was not a fan. The ice cream tasted how you would expect and it was more like chocolate ice cream, if anything. I probably should have tried the desserts off the Restaurant Week Menu. Definitely some hits but also some misses. All in all a good experience though. Beautiful restaurant!"

I wish I was able to take more pictures but the food was good that everyone devoured it lol definitely recommend this place!Unfortunately I couldn't give it 5 Stars because both of my drinks (old fashioned) was not great... for the price that they charged, I barely tasted any liquor in it...It was my birthday and they were able to surprise me with a celebration also.

Made to perfection and it tastes soo much better when you use the coconut milk curry potato dipping sauce. My gf ordered the Laksa ($22) and added seafood (+$3). The curry coconut milk broth gives this dish such great flavor. She loved every bite of it and I agree with the limited bites I was able to steal. I ordered the Rendang Beef ($28) and this is also superb. The beef is slow cooked and it falls apart nicely when you sink your chopstick into it (or fork).So yeah...dinner seems to be the best bet to fully enjoy a good Singaporean meal. Their lunch menu may be cheap, but not worth it for the quantity and quality you're getting."

She then proceeded to argue with me when she realized I was correct, She begins to make another drink. This lady did not clean the machine and then gave it to me.

It was 40ish dollars for two waters and two (small and watered down) screwdrivers and they add mandatory gratuity to the bill. They over booked, the basement the event was held was packed and we had to be moved a long with a few others at a certain point because the waitresses couldn't get to people. We where moved behind a pole which blocked the majority of the stage so we couldn't see the comedians. Sucked cause we had to watch the show on their small TV which I might as well stayed home if I wanted to watch TV and not a live show.I will say however what was good, the comedians tonight where hilarious! Especially the host. Genuinely got a lot of laughs out of my partner and I-- Aside from one. The only comedian that wasn't funny was a white Mexican woman whose entire bit was about green cards and deportation very old and reused shtick nothing she said was original or even said in a funny way, she even admitted the jokes where stolen. She also had a VERY uncomfortable and awkward demeanor and would laugh awkwardly for what seemed like forever during silences. Boring! As a Hispanic I was excited to hear jokes about us but this was flat out lame. I also loved that the host put this Karen in the audience he called ""London"" who kept arguing with him and arguing about a silly Winnie the Pooh joke. Offensive jokes where made BUT nothing that I feel crossed any lines at all so seeing him stand up for himself against her was delightful! Final Notes: Food = Bad, Drinks = Expensive, Watered Down & 2 Drink Minimum, Comedians = 5/6 Where Funny. All in all, I would go again! Maybe not often, but again for sure."

This wouldn't be an issue if they didn't charge $6 for a small cup of Coca-Cola. The comedians were decent this time around. There wasn't much variety as I saw some acts I saw last time, and my previous visit was in September... Some of the lights on the backdrop for the stage were out and weren't replaced out of pure negligence. They have two bathrooms which always had a massive line to enter them. I didn't try any food but it didn't look very appetizing. All in all, this wasn't a completely unredeemable experience but it wasn't great by any means."

Reality was a truly bad open mic night with one unamusing neophyte after another.  Emcee joked that the club does not care about bad reviews.  Even less funny than the show was finding out the next day that Chris Promise had given me my change in counterfeit money (I had paid him with a $100 bill - the only cash I had). And to complete the holy trinity of rib-tickling fun, when I called the club about the fake money, the ""manager"" I spoke to told me that if I bought tickets in Times Square and got ripped off, that was on me and not their problem and hung up on me.

Anyway it is the best around here but if I want more authentic Japanese I would go to the city.
1543,jVYyth-tq-o9o6T54oAWOA,3/11/2021,5 star rating,"What a little gem this place is! I run along the water often and always passed by with much curiosity. It's a small mom and pop joint that is quaint, quiet, and small, but still packs a punch. Their sushi lunch special is THE BEST I've seen for sushi. I normally skip this part of the menu since most places only offer a handful of overdone rolls I have no interest in and a teriyaki. They have a 2-roll and 3-roll lunch special with at least 10 different options, totaling less than $15 and IT IS A STEAL. Everything was bomb. Loving that I can get a variety of sushi without spending $15 for a single roll. Also had their veggie gyoza which was yummy and fresh too. Service is very nice."

Its usually not packed when I used to visit there before covid, but they did a crazy amount of delivery. The fish always tasted fresh when I went. I think it might be a husband and wife team that's running it, which frankly is adorable. Get the dragon and new york rolls. They are spectacular! 5 stars.Also, the ginger salad dressing is AMAZING. I get the salad free usually with the set meals and the ginger dressing is unlike any of the other ones I've ever had. Seriously, I would go just for the salad. I need to ask the owner if it is house made next time I go."

I really enjoy the veggie surprise dumplings and this definitely keeps me coming back as I can try something new every time I go.  You go up and order at the register and then grab a seat along the counter once your dumplings are ready.  The sauces here are also quite nice, particularly the hot and cool monster sauce.   Usually the dumplings are ready within 15 minutes if there isn't much of a rush."

Overall, I would go back to get my shrimp dumplings.P.s. They are cash only. They do have an atm that has a $1.99 fee."

Perfect stop after going out in the area with some good options like chicken, shrimp, pork etc filling. Their dumplings are pretty large so even the 6 pc size alone is filling. It is cash only so make sure you bring physical money ( rarity these days) but super cheap. Late at night they didn't have much left so I got veggie dumplings. Overall a great spot to get food with good seating options outside."

I appreciate them actually rolling and prepping dumplings in the back, but as for the dumplings: I had higher expectations. They're very doughy if you get them steamed, and burnt sometimes if you get them fried. A 4 is generous, but they do have a good variety and great sauce options. I got occasionally if I need to get my fix in for dumplings"

The only downside is the that it is close to the train so very difficult to sit outside and have a conversation. I thoroughly enjoyed the Bobo de Camarao. The shrimp was in a coconut milk base and it was excellent with the rice. Absolutely delicious! My friend ordered the bife acebolado (steak with onion and fries, rice and beans). The steak had a lot of fat. The rice and beans was a little dry and beans needed more sauce... and salt. Overall I thought it was an excellent and spontaneous choice."

I took a break because I traveled and had family in town and started coming back again in May and its been awful every time! All of the sudden everyone is new and the service SUCKS!!!!! The beer is always HOT and it takes forever and the servers are now American and don't speak portuguese. I only come back for the Turma du pagode band and the weekends they play somewhere else in NY, I see them somewhere instead of coming here."
1567,GhMq3ymAsy1-QcixIY7mYg,4/20/2019,4 star rating,"This place was a bit small inside but that's only because it got busy and it's for a good reason. The food tasted fantastic, the only complaint I have is that they only accept cash. It's not really good for large groups so keep your party under 4. They can't accommodate large groups when it's busy, but maybe on a slow night or during the day they can.  I would say this is a great traditional feel and look of a Brazilian restaurant. The samba night was awesome. I would totally recommend this place for a date. Coming from a Brazilian this is as true to a authentic as you can get even the music and look of the restaurant is like taking a chunk out of my home town and putting it in Brooklyn."
1568,GhMq3ymAsy1-QcixIY7mYg,9/30/2019,4 star rating,"Lively fun brunch! Best to book a reservation. We waited about 45 minutes for outdoor seating. We had a drink by the bar and then moved into the outdoor standing area from which we could still hear and see the live music. The band played for a good portion of the time and took a small break in between. While the band is playing drinks at the bar one dollar more there also is a fee for sharing plates of five dollars. This is the reason for lost of star because the food, ambiance and location are on point. I would rather they just wrap band fees into the price and give good deals on the weekends/happy hour. No place like it in Williamsburg! Definitely a must go."

Staff was nice but the music was so loud and it was only 6pm, we could not have a conversation because of the noise. We quickly had our drinks  and ended up eating at  Juliet on their gorgeous rooftop. We had 2 burgers and 2 drinks and paid the same that we paid for 2 drinks and some cheese bread at Miss Favela. Crazy!"

That is the GREAT thing about Miss Favelas, its ambiance. Otherwise, no bueno.The dining experience is terrible. I got around to eating there and it was a sh*t show. I did not appreciate all the aggravation that came with the experience. Other parties looked dissatisfied as well. Cause c'mon! How many times do people need to ask for extra plates, more drinks, a table outside? Shame, shame, shame because the food is delicious. The service sucks and the staff is not the friendliest. I am not going to sit here and bash away because there is no point. I LOVE this place and I do recommend it. If you want strong pitchers of caipirinhas, good live music, and beautiful people to mingle with then YES! this is the place for you.If you are looking to have a pleasant dining experience I do not recommend it. At least not during peak hours which seems to be always the case. Miss Favelas is a popping joint. It is CASH ONLY. There is an ATM by the front door. The bathrooms are tiny and located right next to the kitchen (which is a huge turn off for me)."

I ordered a small sriracha shrimp, a medium classic shrimp, 2 jalapeño burgers, a tea and fries (whether or not it was all for me is irrelevant.) I drove back home & opened my bag. No fries, and medium clam strips instead of shrimp. So I pretty much overpaid for an incomplete AND incorrect order. I'm so glad the company leaves a customer satisfaction number on their receipts.

Our order took quite a bit considering there were only 3 people in line. While we were waiting, kids were sneaking in the side door stealing sodas from the fountain machine. The food was ok, but waaaay too much ketchup.  We had the burger and chicken sandwiches. The chicken was slightly under cooked. I didn't eat all of it. They were bland as they could be. I guess my expectation were too high. The burgers were ok. And I liked their fries despite knowing how nasty the grease was."

The chicken patty was ok, it was dry and no seasoning. It was around $16 for 2 meals which seemed to pricey for what you get. Over all I was unimpressed and I was sad since I had told my girlfriend how good White Castle was.... Not so much! She didn't care for it but then again I didn't either.

I am glad even with high capacity of orders, they got my drink right. The store cleanness is acceptable. With people coming and going in high volume, it's pretty Impressive. If you are on the run, I would recommend a medium pike right at the register. Otherwise you might be looking at few more minutes wait than other locations for your handcrafted drinks."

Cashier was very nice and patient when I was there yesterday, trying to figure out what I want. I was also there 2 weeks ago to pick up my app order.

I came here one day, ordered a Pike coffee with hazelnut only to be told to wait in the waiting area, waited 10+ minutes and nothing. I told the lady where my coffee was, and sure enough, she said ""They already served it"" to which I was clearly not on my phone and waiting for it. Normally, in every other Starbucks, they give it right on the cashier counter --no waiting time. Furthermore, I decided to rest and go to the seating area, and sure enough the 2nd floor was occupied, but the lower level seemed a bit empty, only to realize why it was semi empty, seems the homeless like to hangout there. I don't have a problem, but seemed very unhygienic and smelled pretty bad down there, decided to just leave by the side door there (where they all come in).Would I come back? sure, but I would not stay."

For such a good dessert shop, it's kind of hard to find being located in at the end of the food hall behind Yi Fang Tea.

Whenever I come here and am trying to decide what flavors to get, she never rushes me and always scoops huge scoops to make the experience even better! The customer service is excellent. A recent addition was rainbow flavor, which consists of their taro, pineapple, mango, pandan, and strawberry ice cream. One of my favorites because you get to try a variety of flavors. The toppings that you can add are also nice. The mochis are a different texture from the ice cream and make a good companion. Sprinkles are crunchy and make the ice cream look beautiful! I can't wait to come back here and see what other flavors they are making. I always leave here with a full belly and a happy smile!

For COVID-19, the server was wearing a face mask and gloves. They also have stickers on the ground to tell you where to stand. Today they had the regular flavors but I also saw Misugaru & Cookies which I have never seen - and it was SO GOOD. It also came with a pocky stick. The ice cream wasn't too hard nor too cold. The consistency was just right without melting too quickly. The flavoring was spot on as well- not too light but strong enough to recognize the flavor! The cookies were a nice added touch but I probably would have enjoyed it without the cookies just as much. The server was super nice and friendly as well, as always too. Note: they are cash only. I will say the price is a little high ($6.50) hence 4 stars, but I think it is worth it given their unique and rotating flavors.

Anyway, swung in and it's a little shop in a food court mall style area while the wife was waiting for her fruit tea. There's seating upstairs, but covid has closed down the seating.I ordered 2 scoops and was surprised it was so expensive. It was only $2 more than the single scoop, but the single was $6, so i had to upgrade to 2 scoops. That being said, the value is there. You get a lot of ice cream for the price.As far as flavors go, you can two samples per person. The Almond Cookie is great. I loved it. It had a strong almond flavor like an almond tofu dessert of my youth. Great!The Lychee was so so. I think there were lychee flavors but it was too subtle that the almond cookie blew it out the of the water and i couldn't taste the lychee. I would recommend pairing this with another light flavored fruit ice cream."

There were so many flavors (but less than Chinatown location of course) and as we chose the flavors we would like, the staff let us know those flavors would not be available to make the cake.It's so unfortunate that the popular flavors were practically gone and they wouldn't receive shipment of those flavors till the following week. We ended up choosing flavors that were just basic to our taste buds but overall, we enjoyed it and so did everyone else at the birthday dinner. Just wish they were able to keep everything replenished or have extras in the freezers in BOH."

1603,ErMFay-6o83QB2P1k4ALAg,9/4/2017,3 star rating,"Was just around the area to find something to eat for lunch on Sunday around 12PM. I was hungry and I saw this newly design restaurant , I thought they renovated the old restaurant. I walked in and found out that this is a new restaurant and the previous dumpling shop was out of business. There were only 4 rectangular tables and 2 other tables on the glass window. The menus was displayed on the screen on top of the counter. I was expecting to be very busy but there were only 2 costumers. I guess this is too far away from Main St and no one want to travel all the way here to try it unless it is extraordinary. Beside there are couple similar restaurants around the Main St. This place is self serve so don't expect too much from the servers. I ordered the beef mifen (direct translate rice noodles), it was good. The price on the menus is tax included and my beef mifen came out to be $7.99. The general construction of their noodle soup is noodle with sour cabbage and sour daikon and the meat(depend on which one you order). The favor of the soup is a bit bland so I added their spice on the table. Just an reminder, don't put too much random stuff when you don't know what is it. I learn it a hard way and put too much of their spice then my tongue got numb. Overall it was okay. I will come here again if I am around the area."

You see, I need the object of my affection to have flavor and lots of it. I need it to elicit feelings of passion and desire. And okay, I need it to make me laugh, though that may be pushing it with a bowl of soup:To back way the f**k up, I recently had the indescribable pleasure of trying this spot's beef mifen soup for the first time. Mifen, by the way, apparently means rice noodles.Anyway, from my first slurp, I was a goner. I don't know what was in the broth... Ginger? Star Anise? Tangerine peel? Chiles? But damn, it was heady! It was packed with fork tender beef, baby bok choy, plus various fermented veggies, and topped with tons of cilantro. At first glance, the rice noodles looked like spaghetti, but they were slippery and uniquely chewy. In relative Flushing terms, this small, fast casual eatery is downright posh, boasting a handful of tables and if I am remembering right, a restroom!  It's a bit off the beaten path in terms of location, but is near Star Bakery, which I'd recommend for its sesame balls and egg tarts."
1605,ErMFay-6o83QB2P1k4ALAg,2/17/2019,5 star rating,"This is my go to place when I get off work sometimes. Nice warm broth, smooth noodles with a nice bite to it. Not soggy. If you like cilantro, this is the place. They mostly speak Chinese but will work with you. Just point at the pictures of food that you want. Spicy seasoning is on the side, add if you want. I usually order the beef. Not crazy about the seafood version, but that's just me. I  that they open early for the morning crowd."

Service was good despite there was only one waiter during Sunday early afternoon. Not many people when we were there (only 3-4 tables) but overall it was good first time experience. Adding 1 more star for the fair price.

1608,ErMFay-6o83QB2P1k4ALAg,6/27/2017,5 star rating,"My favorite dish here is probably the Mutton with the Skin Vermicelli, followed by the stewed beef as a close second. The soup has a tanginess that really cuts through the fattiness of the mutton and ughhhhhh I'm drooling just thinking about it. If it's your first time trying Guizhou noodles, get the vermicelli as it's chewier than regular rice vermicelli. And stick with either the regular mutton or the beef, as the Pickled Pepper/Red Sour soups might be sour overload. If you enjoy tripe, their braised tripe is also really good, since they add that spicy sauce to it. If only the restaurant was closer to the station, I would go there every week for sure. PS: The mutton has bones in it, if you don't like bones, don't get it. Personally I love eating meat off the bone but whatever floats your boat."
1609,ErMFay-6o83QB2P1k4ALAg,11/9/2017,5 star rating,Short and simple menu but I wish the English was translated better instead of having terms you'd have to go.It's not as spicy as you'd think perfect balance of meat and flavors.

Place looks Asian but also hipster. Cashier speaks English very well. I wasn't sure what type of noodle they had so I went with my gut and ordered my favorite lamb topping on noodle soup. The guy charged me $9. That's a little expensive for a bowl of noodles. Also I got the Wang lo Kat drink which was $2. I said to stay and I got my food from the counter and there were sone unknown pink stuff in it. I thought it was ginger because it looked like ginger from japanese sushi restaurants but it was sour and had texture like a cabbage. I stopped eating that and focused on the noodle and the noodles were like hand-pulled noodles except a bit more uniformed but same amount of positive mouth feels, chewy and smooth at the same time like what the other reviews say. The soup was amazing which I didn't expect because I asked for less spicy and usually I prefer spicy noodle soup but it didn't need the spicy to make it taste good. The sour vegetables complimented the rich beef broth really well. They give lots of cilantro to contrast the flavors. I usually don't like half a boiled egg in my noodle soup but this was a tea leaf egg, which made it okay. I will visit here again when I go see the doctor again! Or maybe even just to show my friends. It was pretty dead when I went so I was skeptical of their food being good. But to be fair I went at 3ish pm"

I was drove to flushing to visit my friend and it was so late, I saw a newly renovated place and it kind of stand out in that street. The owner recommended the Beef Mifen and sesame pancake. I was soooo gooood, the beef was very tender and chewy, the broth was well balanced between just the right amount of sourness and spiciness. To be honest , I was never a big fan of Mifen, after trying that dish I changed my mind.I also gave the owner five star as well since he is supper nice and explained the ingredients to me very patiently. Highly recommended! Definitely go there try out the tons of flavor Mifen!"

We loved the sense of family when we were there. Everyone seemed to know each other and the waitresses were so nice and attentive.

The place was empty and COLD. We're in the middle of winter in NY... warm up your place for god sakes. Asked for the Cali Eggs Benedict with home fries and a side of sausage.  Coffee, was warm, after putting some milk it got almost cold. The food came, it looked good. As I took the first taste it was COLD!  The eggs were cold the home fries were cold and dry. The sausage looked like it was nuked rather than grilled.  I had a few more bites and had to stop eating. Food was uneatable... COLD and locked taste.  Needless to say, I will never go back to this dinner.  Save your $$ and best go somewhere else or even a 711. I'm sure they have better coffee(hot)."

I'm telling you I've never had such  moist and delicious scrambled eggs. It was perfectly cheesy. I don't know why there was a hamburger bun next to it but the brioche underneath was good. The home fries were good. My friends all loved their food too. The shakshuka was spicy so fair warning if you can't handle it. The Mac and cheese was delicious. Loved it! The nachos were good but it wasn't that special. There was nothing bad that we got and everyone had good things to say. My friends enjoyed their coffees and orange juices as well.

The bouncer on a power trip tried to take advantage of us and create a fake minimum charge of 800$, so we left. It isn't even a lounge or large enough place for it to be a place to justify that kind of price. Don't bother yourself with this place.

Yusef and staff is fantastic and kind and attentive but the hookah tasted awful.

We ordered a chicken biscuit ($10.50) and it was so delicious. The chicken was juicy and tender. The biscuit was flavorful and the butter and hot sauce took it to the next level. While, the chicken was tasty, I had better fried chicken at other places. I feel that while the crust was tasty, it lacked flavor and spice. However, I am not saying the chicken isn't good. It's tasty and I would come back for it but, I wouldn't sit outside nor wait in the freezing cold as they had limited heat lamps for it. The chicken could have also been cut a bit better. A few bites for my friend had no meat and they had leftover biscuit.I also got the butter pecan crunch donut ($4.50). It was tasty and delicious. It wasn't overly sweet and I could see myself eating it with a side of vanilla ice cream topped with caramel.The service was decent. We had to wait a few minutes to get seated and get our order taken. However, when it came time  to pay and leave, well the waitress was nowhere to be found.

The most notable thing in my opinion was the way the amount of space that was available. That said, don't get me wrong - make a reservation. The reason I say that is because we had a reservation at a very busy brunch time (Sunday at 11:30) and we just knew that we'd be outside (in winter). But to our surprise there's an entire (indoor) space in the back of the restaurant!We also overheard some people without reservations waiting for inside space as well and they got times under 1 hour which still sounds rough but for a brunch reservation indoors in Williamsburg at a well known restaurant that's not bad at all. Food was good, maybe slightly overhyped but still would recommend trying. Service was excellent - my voice was going out so the waiter was able to make me a hot drink that wasn't on the menu to help out. It didn't work, but I am grateful for the effort lol. Would recommend!"
1634,bMju8cdz4RdJVoPvbWQqSQ,11/29/2022,3 star rating,"Had seen this place featured on so many must try guides and so had to stop in. Maybe it was the cold weather, or the fact we had to wait an hour when we were told the wait was 20 minutes, but it was a pretty underwhelming experience. The outside seating has a couple of heat lamps scattered in between tables-not nearly enough to warm the eating space, while the sliding door has a nasty habit of opening from the wind, in addition to whenever servers come in, putting a timer on how fast you eat your meal before it gets cold. The servers were extremely polite and friendly and apologetic but the setup was just poor.The food itself- the chicken was a bit on the dry side, and while the shell was wonderfully crispy and seasoned, it didn't translate to the whole entity as a dish. The hush puppies were also a bit stale tasting (or cold?), and the beans were just ok.  Fried catfish was decent  good seasoning, crispy, and savory flaky fish. The honey butter and biscuits were fantastic, as was the donut we got on the side while waiting. I would buy a few of those honey butter jars if I could. Willing to give this another try though when its warmer."

That bite of chicken with the glazed flakey, buttery biscuit is everything I want out of a chicken biscuit. I also opted to order a side of baked beans, which were also very delicious. A great mix of sweet and savory. You can't come here and NOT get a pie, so I took home a slice of pumpkin pie and I'm so glad I did.

We ordered the chicken biscuit and there is a reason why Guy Fiery came to try it.First of all, I don't even EAT chicken. I don't like the taste of chicken in general but decided to give this a chance because the incredible staff convinced me that it was worth a try. My partner doesn't like fried foods, and the chicken biscuit was both of the things we don't have preferences for. We got it anyway, and IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS WE'VE EVER HAD. The hot honey sauce on the chicken is just an absolute work of art and the entire meal in general felt like a story. I don't think I've ever bit into something so tender but also breaded so perfectly. The texture artfully mastered. We live far from here but would definitely return here for this chicken biscuit. Not to mention, the person who was helping us (wish I remembered his name) but he's tall, dark brown hair, and glasses, just was so genuine and made us feel like an old friend or something. That really added to the experience! Highly recommend this place since it can convince both a person who doesn't eat chicken and a person who doesn't eat fried food to fall inlove with chicken biscuit!!!"

It has a down home, southern cafe-like setting in the front with a lovely sunken, dining room with more of a communal table setting.  The staff was efficient and . I've tried their 3pc chicken combo and it was pretty decent. Recently, I went for brunch and ended up ordering the chicken biscuit (dine-in) and the signature doughnut coated in some type of caramel/toffee coated in crushed pecans (to-go). The chicken itself was a little thinner than I expected, but I was well seasoned and tasty.  The biscuit was fluffy and amazing.

It has a clean spacious layout and cool branding.  The first problem is that they have one person working and a pretty inefficient operation.  Need a couple people here to get the orders out quicker. They do have a really clean store and a nice set up. I credit the management for doing a good job keeping it this way. It is also a quiet place if you want to get work done but the food and drinks are always under par. The yogurt is very average and has a runny consistency to it. I also tried the acai bowl and it was a little better than the yogurt. I don't drink smoothies or anything like that but I think that is what they are known for.I will keep coming back here since it is convenient and a good place to get work done. Hopefully, I will find some food I like soon enough! We will see."

I decided to try the tunacado, which is similar to my usual spicy tuna. The bread is prime - it's a crispy warm flatbread. Their sandwiches go well with their shakes. I ordered this vegan red supreme shake that is mainly strawberry and very creamy. The only negative is the price. I recommend coming here during the week when they have their half off specials. I do not recommend paying full price for the shakes, but I definitely think the sandwiches are worth it."

Despite the steep prices, the actual acai club was pretty tasty, and filling. Usually 2 hours after eating breakfast I find myself wanting to snack on something, but this filled me up, and didn't leave me wanting to snack throughout my morning. This Joe & the Juice location also loses points for wait time. When I ordered, I was the first and only customer in the store. However, people who came after me received their items before me. This was annoying because I ended up waiting a total of ten minutes for a bowl, which is pretty long considering I was the first to order, and no one else was in the store."

I also asked the staff member if I could get some water, and went back to my table to get my own reusable water bottle. When I returned no one tended to me and after waiting for a minute I asked if I could get my water bottle filled up, to which another staff member said ""give me a second"" and went back to the order he was working on (I stood there for another full minute). 10 minutes later I come back to the counter with my bottle again and stood for another 20-30 seconds looking at the staff members to see if anyone would help me, and no one even looked my way. After 35 minutes I asked if my order was ready yet, and it turns out they forgot about it. Would like to see some improvements in this location..."

My fav though is the bohdi noodles. They are also a stir fried ramen noodle, but made in a hit of coconut milk so they are slightly sweet and creamy, without being saucy. I highly recommend with some crispy chicken atop it. Their spring rolls are really good as well, mainly due to their thick, sweet, yet slightly acidic, pomegranate dipping sauce for them. I have eaten from here several times and will continue to do so!"

Which is like, you have all the access to food you could ever want but you can't eat whatever you want. (I'm rolling my eyes at me too.) Cut to the chase: gluten interacts with a much needed med and if I eat it I get a migraine that no pain reliever will temper. I have to wait till it's out of my system, which is a really long time. So I call to make orders now, to ensure there's no gluten. You think you know where this is going but surprise! It's about bean sprouts. I asked for no bean sprouts as i have a reaction to those too. But like, good riddance. Anyway, called, confirmed no gluten, asked for no bean sprouts *twice*MF'n bean sprouts. Then I'm thinking if they can't get that right, how do I know they got the gluten-free part right? So I call to say, hey I got bean sprouts, can't eat the food, please refund. And the woman is like, I have no record of your call. I give her my name, address, mention I asked about gluten-free, and blessed be the iphone, told her the time of my call- which lasted a whole 9 min. Sorry, no record of your call or order.

We were pressed for time so we ordered to go and waited in the car. Food took about 30 mins to finish so we were a bit annoyed. My belly was in my hand (I was starving). We both got the spicy basil rice. Mine had shrimp and she had veggies. I devoured my meal. It was very tasted and I put some sweet chilli sauce all over mmmm mmmm good. I do feel like they put too many peppers in it so I just picked them out. I also ordered the spring rolls. It came witg some sort of sweet sauce that was actually good. Overall we paid about $35 total. I wish the container was filled more with rice but overall I was satisfied.  Lets just say, good things can come in little packages."

It looked like a small portion but it was enough to fill me up. I had also ordered a side of sausage and I was uncomfortably full after eating both. My friend got the steak and eggs and I need that next time. I could smell the chimichurri and was salivating before my shrimp and grits came out.

We ordered the Arancini rice balls per recommendation of the waiter. It came out with some marinara sauce, salty, and good but not to die for.

I went here on my most recent birthday and brought home a box of pastries--because why not? This is a little out of my way--a train ride over to Williamsburg, then a walk on Metropolitan Avenue--but always worth the trip.

You can also order sandwiches and lunch items from their menu - but to be honest, their pastries are so good I've never gotten that far  Everything is vegan, but you wouldn't necessarily know it since they don't post much signage.

Reminds me of the good ol college days where you can go somewhere casual get a drink and watch sports. I also got the day breaker drink which was interesting like sweet and salty I think the tequila was good & strong. My boyfriend had the soup beer drink and he liked it.

I'd never get wings there again. (I've heard their boneless wings are better.) I've ordered other things from the menu & it tends to be flavorless. The truffle fries weren't too bad ! I recommend going for the vibes and the beers but not the food."

1701,G1HUAEpZcNHXO1V1gLoASQ,2/4/2022,2 star rating,"So this review is based on thr online ordering system. We ordered online which was not an issued, the issue is that you have no clue who is delivering your food. We called and they could not even tell us who was delivering it. 40 minutes after yhe food was ordered still nothing here. Called the store and told they are just waiting for the pick up. Ended up calling and asking if we can just come pick it up."
1702,iQZYOzNB7b-vTF806dlbYA,5/4/2019,3 star rating,"Their pizza is just average.Recommendations: Make sure you always look at their deals because paying so much money for just an average pie is ridiculous. Their deals make the pizzas worth buying-- I was able to purchase two mediums for the price of one basically since we ordered for carry out. They also have amazing party deals. My favorite combination is pepperoni with Italian sausage, but they recently added meat balls as an option to their topping list and it was pretty good. I would skip out on their other items aside from the pizzas. Service: BAD!! Although our food was prepared in time, it took a long time for the workers come to the cashier so that we could pay. They saw us and even walked past us several times as we impatiently stood there waiting. They seemed so out of it and neglected customer service-- no smiles at all!So overall, make sure you always check their deals and be prepared to deal with a bit of attitude when you receive your meal."

Papa Johns. Pizza is mediocre.... and if you are a pizza snob then it's absolute trash. But if it's super late and you don't have a frozen pizza stashed anywhere in your freezer  this is the place to go. They deliver , it's edible , you had no other choice"

1706,iQZYOzNB7b-vTF806dlbYA,4/18/2020,1 star rating,I typically order pizza after procrastinating on what to eat for hours. Sadly I've had a terrible experience with this specific location. It seems to me that this location would often cancelled orders without providing customers a refund in return. They've scammed me as well as many paying customers. I urge you all to not perceive any of these reviews with a grain of salt. Spend your money in other Papa John's locations with higher reviews. It's very unfortunate that they are not accepting dial calls. I've constantly called this location and the manager of the location. I've filled a case with Papa Johns through their customer service app. I have yet to receive any updates.

1708,iQZYOzNB7b-vTF806dlbYA,2/16/2021,1 star rating,I used to go to this spot for delivery online. It is very bad. It is very expensive (usually $14 to $20) depending what you get. Also you must tip the person or he will spit on your food. Thank goodness none of my foods were spit on. I gave them a one dollar tip because they are greedy and rip people off with their disgusting food. Don't go here it is too expensive and they want your money when they are not even homeless.

When presented our bill, our waitress crossed out the total and wrote $39 on the top of receipt, which she said was with 15% service charge added on. Now, my friends and I were pretty drunk, but we know that 15% would not add up to $39. We let her know, and she brought over a calculator. All four of us watched her punch in ""26 x .15"" and the calculator said the answer was 3.9. She says ""see, $39.""  And we had to sort of politely correct her, ""no... That says 3.9."" Are you fucking kidding me? We can only imagine how many drunk people get taken advantage of if this is their way of operating. My friends and I still can't believe this actually happened? Maybe make sure your servers can pass 4th grade math first (unless you are intentionally scamming us). That was ridiculously stupid."

We were going to do bottle service and enjoy the night but HELL NO.Mind you...my family members and myself were not drunk. They were threating to hit them and I.

1721,lW-qMNVVPh5KJMyXIDn86A,4/24/2016,2 star rating,"The Positive:  The music was enjoyable, the waitresses were attentive, the bathrooms were clean and there was no cover charge.The NEGATIVE:  2 x $10 drinks=$25 because they charge ""tax and tip"" at the time of EACH order.  I know I haven't been out for a while, but is this the new norm?The drinks were soda'd-down, juiced-down or watered-down which is unacceptable. The layout of the place prevents one from enjoying the dance floor.  The stools that adorn the sides are uncomfortable for people under a certain height, so they are forced to sit near the entrance away from the dance floor and since the bar is smack dab in the middle of the establishment, they have to abandon their table and drinks each time they get up to dance... or they can dance next to their table (if they aren't shy).I am the type of person that makes my own fun (ambiente), so regardless of the negative... I enjoyed myself.Drink responsibly... Please Don't Drink and Drive."

Capped by a textbook perfect tiramisu. The small staff couldn't have been friendlier, and miracle of miracles the joint is not DEAFENING. The walk from the theatre district pre-show is well worth it, as the quality is miles above more conveniently located restaurants. This is now hands down my go to pre or post eaterie."

Many times it's pretty awesome food, though not the greatest ambiance or atmosphere being located inside. The lights are typically off in the dining area and it feels more like a cafeteria than a restaurant, where people with food from other spots can sit, which is kind of disruptive.In the past service has been good, if not great. But this last time, which really really really left a bad taste in my mouth, the server was just awful. She seemed to hate her job. She was rude because we asked for Pellegrino and they didn't have it. Instead of saying there was a delivery issue and they'd have it back in soon, as another person there who I got up and spoke to told me, she literally argued rudely with us saying they never carried and don't carry it at all. We eat there a lot. We know that isn't true. But who argues with a customer out for a nice meal over sparkling water.Then she unpleasantly took our order and never came back. We had to flag down another person for silverware, beverages and basic things. It really soured me on coming back. In fact, the last few times my husband has suggested it (we live a block away), I've nixed it because of that last experience.Plus with the seating area so dark and the server having such negative energy, it felt unwelcoming and sad. I'm sure we'll be back. The food is 90% of the time good. But for the prices and what they aim to be, they really need to do better to keep people like us coming back."

1727,fahnqhxhFqyMAHKVC01sSA,3/16/2023,2 star rating,"Very disappointing. Have been eating at Dell'anima for years - in the Village, then at its location at the Gotham food Court and for the past few years since the pandemic by delivery. Unlike other restaurants,  Dell'anima's food quality was always excellent and even more importantly consistent - until tonight. The food this evening must have been prepared by someone other than the chef, Andrew. The delicata squash was burnt even charred. The fish, even though in parchment, had a smoky taste and was very over spiced. The chicken wasn't dry but also over spiced and the pear salad just didn't work. All in all, on a scale of one to ten, it was a five. How sad!"

The brussel sprouts were quite literally the best CRISPY brussel sprouts I've ever had, and this is a must-try if you come here. The crispy brussell sprouts with the crunchy pepitas are the perfect side to any of the comforting pastas.The bolognese was also very good, maybe could've used a pinch of salt, but the pasta was perfectly al dente, and bolognese sauce still had lots of flavor. Highly recommended and a great addition to Gotham West Market."

Whether you dine in around the adorable bar with a chef's view or get take out, Dell'Anima is consistently delicious.I've tried almost every pasta on the menu (lol) and say that you truly cannot go wrong -- they are all delicious! But to help with your menu decisions, I'll share some of my menu favorites:The Endive Salad is one of my favorite salads EVER. It's light, fresh, crisp, and perfectly topped with homemade anchovy dressing and parmesan shavings.The Octopus is impeccable: fresh and cooked to perfection, surround by a delicious bean salad that pairs perfectly with the octopus.The Tajarin Alla Carbonara is the best carbonara I've ever had, seriously. Homemade pasta cooked to Al Dente perfection, crispy speck, just the right amount of pepper, and mixed with the most perfect cream sauce (and a fresh egg yolk on top!).The Bucatini Alla Arrabbiata is a go to classic. Delicious Al dente bucatini covered in the most delicious, fresh, perfectly spiced arrabbiata sauce. The sauce is so pristine, it reminds me of Italy.The Pollo Al Diavolo is just wow. This piece of chicken (I should say hunk of chicken that can feed you for 2-3 days, lol) is unmatched. Perfectly seasoned, juicy, and skin cooked to an incredible crisp. This isn't your ordinary chicken!If Dell'Anima has been on your list or you're in the area, get in there! It's a meal you won't forget."

Always a charming and authentic NYC spot, Tavern has only been enhanced in its glory with the addition of one of the more glorious outdoor spots you can imagine in the city--a large patio tucked on a quiet low traffic or possibly even dead end/no traffic side street in the scenic west village.Food is always quite successful--whether you go for standard ""tavern"" fare and stick to their ever excellent burger, try to hew healthy and go with an option like their excellent, colorful and flavorful beet salad, or go full entree with something like their salmon or half roasted chicken, you will have a large and tasty meal and leave here sated.Part of its charm to me lies in its feel as an authentic, old school NY spot. As such, service can be a bit more relaxed than you might be used to in New York--always friendly, oft quirky, but sometimes a bit slow. Generally this would irk me in NY, but this feels like the kind of place where you want to linger for a couple of drinks anyway and feels like part of its charm.Mixed drinks are strong here; wine selection solid. I do wish they had a better and more adventurous draft beer list, but, hey--you can never go wrong with a Guinness, right?"

I want to give 5 stars because the first experience was wonderful; the second visit was not nearly as pleasant. The waitress and bartender were amazing both times, the food and drinks were as well - the problem was that the second we walked in the hostess (a blonde woman) was extremely rude from the start. I am not sure if it was because we have a few senior aged people in our group or because we looked like tourists (even though my grandfather worked in the city for 40+ years) but she was giving us nasty looks the entire time. She even asked, ""What do you want?"" as we walked in instead of greeting us; I responded ""Some drinks and maybe apps"" to which she rolled her eyes. Additionally, when a table at the bar area opened up, we grabbed it. She then tried to kick us out from the table. No one else in the bar was waiting for a seat so we were confused, she stated it was because ""it was for people who were ordering food"". However, we had already indicated that we would be ordering food. Not to mention it was nearly 10 pm at this point! Our waitress was absolutely wonderful and our first experience was lovely, so I feel bad leaving a mixed review, but this woman really seemed to target us and it made it a very negative experience the second time around."

1742,lxQ-tzFmL1tmUqZUN-CSRQ,10/16/2021,5 star rating,Wow i stopped by on a whim after seeing the rose pistachio croissant on their google maps profile and it did not disappoint! I didn't expect the rose pistachio croissant to have any filling but it did and added a great contained moisture to the otherwise dry croissant. The filling was a bit on the sweet side and can easily start dripping out near the end.I ended up also getting the mushroom danish and turmeric cookie because they caught my eye.. the danish was delightful! Wish it was warmed up a bit but there was some hint of horseradish that made it unique; was not too salty. Would pass on the turmeric cookies next time - exactly what you'd imagine and on the tough (as opposed to soft) cookie side.

Bought myself a basil biscuit & pistachio rose croissant. Holy smokes, I toasted the basil biscuit when I got home - damn, SO GOOD with butter melting on it. And the pistachio rose croissant was so fun to eat! Definitely has a lot of pistachio flavor in every flakey, buttery soft bite you take. And the fact that they included pistachio paste inside the croissant - now THAT was a game changer!Thanks Partybus for the yums, will definitely be back for more! :)"

Highly recommended! Haven't tried the sweet pastries but I bet they're amazing too. Quiches are delicious as well.Breads were also very good. Their sourdough is great, and the fruit and nut baguette is crammed full of fruit, making it fairly sweet, which is nice toasted with a swipe of good butter. I'd say their pies are a bit of a weakness though. The strawberry rhubarb pie I tried was super sweet and the crust basically disintegrated. Another time I tried a chess pie and although the crust was delicious, I wasn't in love with the filling. Cookies are okay, but I've only tried their peanut chip which had whole peanuts in it. Good but nothing too special."

1747,lxQ-tzFmL1tmUqZUN-CSRQ,5/23/2022,5 star rating,"They also have the best cinnamon roll I've ever had!! The key thing - it's not overly sweet. The brioche bun is so soft and pillowy. The edge is baked a little more so comes with a nice crunch, but not hard by any means. The icing is another star of the show - the right amount of sweet and tang, no graininess at all. It's not the most cinnamony cinnamon bun but everything just goes so perfectly together. A very well-rounded bun that wouldn't leave you sugared out and feeling heavy even if you ate the whole thing (like I did)."

Based on the reviews here and the photos on their Instagram, I quickly pre-ordered a pie for next week. But, I couldn't wait to try this place even before then. I popped in for 2 of the pistachio croissants! I didn't realize until now that it's twice baked because when you look at it, you can tell that it's cooked for longer than you would think. But it adds a certain great crunch to it as in it didn't taste over baked at all! It was one of the best croissants I've had in a long time! Definitely worth a visit! I may pop in again for another treat before I pick up my pie."

I love and crave their 'the eggie' sandwich on their scallion bun. Ooof.. please do yourself a favor and get the scallion bun- it is so good!They have many options, so I still have alot to try but this is definitely a top spot in the neighborhood for me.

I volunteered to illustrate brown bags and have written PARTYBUS BAKESHOP maybe a thousand of times by now but it was not until last week I got to bite into one of their sesame brioche bun. Sure, it is usually a vehicle for burgers usually but I was hungry after a long stroll downtown and could not wait to bite into the soft squishy bun. Simple satisfactory. Before I knew it, the bun was gone, into the belly. I don't think I have eaten bread like this since adulthood. That bun reminded me somewhat of an hazy summer afternoon when I just got out of school, giggled my way with friends to the neighborhood bakery and cured my hunger with a similar squishy bun.

My spanakopita omelette came out quickly enough that I could eat at the same time as my dining partner who got a build your own bowl. She liked being able to customize  - greens base and then added protein and veggies. Omelette was tasty and very fresh, the side of potatoes  were fantastic. More of a neighborhood vibe than you would expect from the location. Lunch time so several folks getting take out. We wanted to sit and found space in the rear - although a bit close to busy restroom. Didn't get drinks or dessert but they all looked good."

It was filled with chocolate and the pastry was flaky and quite delicious. It was big enough to share and worth it for the price.

They open at 6pm and I'm literally like a 15-20 minute jaunt on that brown line from my job. Walked past a million times and was like $1 pbr?! Shut the hell up. Open your doors. Cries. Finally managed to walk in with friends a few months ago and had quite the experience. It's a metal bar. Or in the back of my mind, it is an Addams Family bar. Which fits in pretty well with my general morose demeanor in life. You might be the only chick in the bar unless you come with girls. There's an electrocution throne, coffins, skeletons, fun records on the walls. The whole shebang. Not to be boring I couldn't pull myself away from having an Iron Maiden beer.

He place is littered with posters, plaques, guitars, picks, laminates, etc of metal bands.

Had no clue this place existed but my friend took me there. Walked in and was pleasantly surrounds at all the decor. I didn't even have enough time to check it all out bc it was last call. Everyone was super friendly and looked like they all we're in some 80s heavy metal band. It was amazing actually and I will definitely go back if I am anywhere near there

Alas, my favorite hometown metal bar often had growling bikers and overly intoxicated stumbling girls. The vibe at Duff's felt friendly and welcoming, even. (Note: aside from my myriad tattoos, I don't really fit in here - I like designer purses and pearls). I never felt like anyone was looking at me weird - the crowd seemed pretty mixed and friendly. Bartenders seemed friendly as well.The decor was awesome - lots of metal and horror memorabilia. The back area has an electric chair and a dentist chair you could sit in. Also a gimp cage. For a few bucks you can spin their wheel and win any number of prizes - a special drink called the Coney Island whitefish (served in a condom) or a less awesome prize like a dog biscuit or a Jesus Juice shot!Great drink specials.

You can sit, have some extremely cheap drinks and have hour long conversations about the decor.  Once you've had a few drinks in you, you can almost swear that the life sized Frankenstein is staring you down!  My favorite part of this place is most definitely the jukebox!!!!!  Best one ever!!!  In one night, I've played David Bowie, Faith No More, Queensryche, Ice Cube, Motorhead, Slayer and Corey Taylor.  Amazing mix.  They also even have Donna Summer and Stevie Wonder among all the rock and metal c.d.'s!  They try to have a tiny mix for some since there is always an eclectic crowd there.  Just be careful because sometimes it eats your money without playing what you picked. Also, sometimes it takes a while for your songs to play. Other times, it's speedy.  When songs from the jukebox aren't being played, they play Sirius XM's Boneyard which is great. Only friendly, non-judgmental people frequent this establishment.  Always take a chance and spin the wheel.  You may get a free drink, shot, etc.  The bathrooms leave a LOT to be desired.  No paper towels in either the men's or women's.  Yes, I went in the men's by mistake since the doors just blend in the walls that I didn't even notice there was a women's right next to it!  I love this place so much though that I refuse to take away a star for the paper towel thing and cleanliness.  Hey, just wipe your hands down with some t.p. (as annoying as that is) and you're done.  I've never been here when it has been packed so I can't say how crowded it gets here, but on the weekends I'm pretty sure it gets that way.  For the people who say that they ""don't get it"" regarding this place, that's just the thing.  You don't get it at all, have no clue and this place is not for you!  My goal in life is to get everyone I know who hasn't been here, to come here and know the awesomeness that is Duff's!!!"

The drinks were relatively cheap and the bartender, who was very glammed up for the bar, was really nice. I am not too much a fan of the heavy metal and I did not know that it was a ""metal"" bar but the people there seemed into the place. Also, I assume that many of the folks at the bar were locals from the neighborhood. Although I did not have a horrible experience at Duffs, I probably will not be back unless I really want a beer. But, if you are into metal, loud music and a bright red setting then this is the place for you."

BOOOO.However, I still fell in very much like with Duff's. I was a little wary going in because tbh I'm not a huge fan of metal music, but it didn't bother me at all. It was mainly playing in the background and not so glaringly loud I had to shout over my piles of shots to talk to my bf. Did I say piles? Yup. We got shot after shot because it was so cheap (I assumed so because my bf had no reservations paying.. wait but he's like that all the time. Oh well - see previous reviews for the affordability, but I'm still pretty sure his wallet didn't bleed). My jack and ginger was a little watered down, ngl, but my bf came up with the brilliant idea of just ordering shots of jack and chase it with beer. Woot!The decor was just out of this world. I was so fascinated by the various metal band and horror movie paraphernalia on the walls and even on the ceiling, as well as a random drum stick glued to the wall beside me. The booths were kinda retro, like those you see in Pulp Fiction. I love it.  Will definitely return for more cheap booze and oo-ing and ahh-ing at the decor. And maybe catch porn on the screen. Maybe."

It's not bad, it's hard for me to really judge the place because if your friend knows the owner it's assuming that the owner won't drop the ball or the employees won't drop the ball just because they're bringing in someone they know well. However I can't say with the time that I was there that we were taken care of very very well. We were asked several times if everything is going well at our table, our hookah tasted great and the drinks came fast and furious without any hiccups. Be prepared though to spend a hell of a lot of money because it is quite pricey once you start drinking enjoying yourself smoking hookah and then you're ready to go. Outside of that though, a cool place. If I'm ever in the city then I'll probably stop by but if not then I'd rather go to a place outside of Manhattan to go enjoy myself."

It's a nice, comfortable restaurant with a big bar and thatched hut kind of theme.We aren't familiar with Himalayan food so we asked our server for suggestions. He recommended a variety of items for us to share. Here's what we got.Garlic naan with hummus - 6 pieces of very fresh and garlicky naan and a good serving of hummusChicken jhol momo - 8 delicious momo dumplings with a nice dipping sauceSekuwa -these are skewered grilled meats. We ordered chicken and goat. Each order was 2 skewers. We preferred the chicken because it was plumber and more tender. They came with a crispy rice that had a nice nutty taste.Aloo gobi - The menu says this is cauliflower and potatoes but it's not the same dish you get at Indian restaurants. The ingredients are inside a think pancake, kind of like a papusa. The order included 4 large pancake quarters and a bunch of sides - some kind of lentil mixture, mustard greens, tomato sauce, and pickled vegetables. Several of the sides were kind of spicy but all tasted very good.This was way too much food for 3 people so we had some leftovers. The service was very good and the whole meal was very nice overall. Highly recommended."

We ordered the pork jhol momo, the shrimp momo (fried), the garlic nan with hummus, the chicken sekuwa and the not a taco ""choila roti"". For drinks, I tried the iced chaiya. The not a taco was my absolute favorite. It has a nice kick and was bursting with flavors. The jhol momo and the garlic nan were a close second. They were also really good and flavorful. I didn't care too much for the shrimp jhol momo fried. It was just too hard for me. Next time, since there will be a next time and I love shrimp, I'd get it steamed. The chicken sekuwa was so tasty. I typically don't order chicken because I'm scared it'll end up being dry, but this chicken was extremely juicy. We didn't really eat the crispy rice that accompanied it. The iced chaiya wasn't my favorite.

1788,VHORZQg5A3YNBptRN92QGg,1/23/2022,5 star rating,"Short review: Get the chicken choila/not a taco, any jhol momo, the grilled boneless lamb chunks, and of all things the Kathmandu alfredo (yes you read that right.) The only thing we disliked was the grilled pork chops.Longer review:I was here a while ago with a group of people, perhaps a year ago but I'm not exactly sure. This place looks a bit unique having a coffee bar in front and a large area in back. The service here was pleasant and it is a nice mix of what you expect from Nepalese food but with a few notable new dishes. There was definitely a small fusion aspect and for once I appreciated it as I found the new dishes to be a pleasant fusion. As I was there a long time ago, I'll give a small impression on each of them. I would say overall that the dishes were very well flavored but perhaps a bit less spicy but I am aware that Nepalese and Tibetan food tends to be a lot less spicy than Indian food so perhaps this is just influence for me liking the spices from the other cuisines more. The dishes below are arranged by preference not section.Excellent:The ""Not a Taco""/Chicken Choila: This is essentially a mix of chicken choila and an Indian kati roti and it is definitely one of the better dishes. If I was here alone, I could probably get just two or three of these and I would be very happy with maybe one appetizer or something if I just ordered two. The spices just as with the normal chicken choila mixed well and it went perfectly with the nicely made roti. Would highly recommend. If you want a larger version of this dish or if you're in a group and many people want to try but you don't want to order multiple of them, simply order the regular chicken choila (and perhaps some rotis and make some tacos yourself) and it will be somewhat similar.Chicken Jhol Momo: These were excellent momos. The sauce had great flavor as well. Would recommend.Kathmandu Alfredo with garlic naan: I guess you could call this Naple-ese food (I somewhat apologize for the terrible pun.) Another person for some reason wanted this odd hybrid and the waiter also recommended so we it ordered. I'm not exactly sure if Nepalese-Italian food exists otherwise but it probably should judging by this dish. It was essentially a spicy alfredo with some other Nepalese spices and it was topped with garlic naan. I'm not exactly sure why we loved it when it had pasta and bread in one dish but it was delicious and I would recommend it. Just order it.Grilled boneless lamb chunks w/grilled veggies. The lamb was very tender and it came out absolutely sizzling on a very hot plate. I would recommend moving the lamb eventually as it will eventually burn later but we essentially devoured it so it was an issue. The portion size was nice for the price.Sadeko Aloo (spicy seasoned potatoes:) This was a tasty version though as expected from the place, it was less spiced. Still very tasty and very well prepared potatoes.Malekhu ko Macha (fried whitings:) These were also good with a nice fry. The waiter recommended them and I can see why, Good:Dry Masala Wings: Good flavors and a nice crisp though I preferred from the other appetizers but then again I don't really like wings.Kathmandu poppers (spicy green chili peppers stuffed w/potatoes & cheese, battered & deep-fried:) this was another fusion dish and they did a good job though it was less hot than I thought it would be. Perhaps the fry was enough that it wasn't that spicy but it was still nicely flavored with the cheese and potato. Goat Sekuwa: This was fine but I've had better versions at other Nepalese spots. Still tasty. Alright:Grilled pork chops w/grilled veggies. This was unfortunately the only bad dish of the night. The pork was way too fatty and we'll all be very hot plate did a good job making it crispy, it was also just way too chewy. I wouldn't recommend it at least if it's like this normally.In other words, of all the dishes we had there was only one bad dish. The chef has done a good job here combining traditional Nepalese flavors with some modern twists. I am still completely baffled by the Nepalese spicy alfredo and the fact that I so remember it a year later says something even when there were other dishes that were better. Other note: In terms of drinks, I only remember the Chiya which is Nepalese Chai which was fine."

I have been to Nepali places before which try to sell Indian dishes in the mix to sell more, but While in Kathmandu doesn't compromise!I'd recommend you look at the menu beforehand because it takes a bit to prepare the platters, but it's worth the wait. I actually found it helpful to catch up with my friend while we waited for it. We ordered the Chicken Jhol Momo, Fried Pork Momo, Sauteed Masala Wing Fusion, Chitwan Ko Tass, and the Chicken Platter. Nothing disappointed, and it was a great time trying out new flavors. The flavors even surprised me, who grew up eating Indian food, which is very close to Nepali food.I highly recommend this place. Please note it was cash only."

The service is excellent, and they have winter outdoor seating available--though, be warned that the outdoor structure becomes essentially an indoor dining situation, should the doors slide closed.They have a lovely little happy hour, every day, from 4-6!"

Was so happy they're open and indeed it was packed at 11pm on Monday night! Great wine list delish bar snacks, Corin (not sure of the correct spelling of her name) and Tai were steaming the vibe in the air. Wagyu Sliders is a must try in addition the charcuterie that enhanced the richness of a bottle of burgundy even further. Tips: they will open wines that are only by bottles as long as you can consume two glasses. How superb."

It gets crowded very quickly so I advise you to come right when happy hour starts! We got a bottle of white wine ($28) to share and it was very smooth with a hint of  sweetness that I enjoyed. We also got half dozen oysters but I would not recommend getting them, as they were very small. The cheese and meat platter that we also got was delicious. Surprisingly, it's very filling. The prices are very reasonable for a wine bar in the city. Service and ambiance was great, as the setting feels very cozy and intimate. In all, we had a wonderful time and I'd definitely come back again."
1795,VHORZQg5A3YNBptRN92QGg,6/20/2022,1 star rating,"This was honestly the worst dining experience I have had in the decade I have lived in New York. I made a reservation for 6pm for three people; two of the three got there about half an hour early and wished to be seated at one of the available tables outside. The waitress (brown hair, tattoos) assigned to outside VERY BLATANTLY ignored them and did not acknowledge them for 15 minutes. Getting frustrated, they left to have a drink elsewhere to wait for me to arrive. Once I did, we were seated (by a different server while the original one continued to serve literally EVERY OTHER table outside except for ours). We ordered drinks and some cheese which was fine but there was a complete lack of service other than that: no water refills and no checking in to ask if we needed anything else all the while the outside server is paying attention to all ten other tables around us. After waiting like 20 minutes for the check, I called out to the original waitress in order to ask for it. She definitely heard me and completely ignored me. I then approached her who, upon seeing me coming towards her, did a 180 and started telling the table she had just been about to leave ALL about the menu instead of helping me. I waited for her to be done and turn around. I asked her for the check as she attempted to just walk by me and put the menu she was holding in front of her face like I didn't exist; only once she realized I wasn't just going to let her go she acknowledged my presence. I asked for the check and the other server brought it out. I have worked in food service. I hate writing reviews, especially bad ones because I try to give people the benefit of the doubt. People have bad days and sometimes places are understaffed, I completely get it. But to not be acknowledged really is rude and not okay. I will not be returning and I will be making sure to tell everyone I know on every platform I can to never go to this restaurant. It was absurd and I would have just left had I not been worried about the SEVENTY FIVE DOLLAR NO SHOW FEE. Honestly screw this place."

I've been here at least 4-5 times and each time has always impressed. A+ for consistency. Came here most recently on a Saturday afternoon at 5:15 pm for a date. When I got there the oval bar seating was 3/4 and was surprisingly packed, but we managed to get two chairs to sit at at the bar. We ordered for happy hour: one glass of rose, one glass of white, and the 3 cheese/salami board. Total bill came out at $36 tax and tip not included. AMBIANCE:Ambiance ambiance ambiance! This place is incredible! Romantic, music not too loud. Great spot to set the mood if you're going out with a special someone. Super cute decor and wood themes. I love how the bar is set up like an island with a giant circular table. There are some seating by the windows, towards the walls, and at the back hugging the wall of the bathroom, but this place is small and could pack at most ~20 people comfortably I'd sayGet here early though. Lelabar opens at 5pm, and when we got there at 515pm on Saturday the bar was nearly 3/4 full! This place does get crowded and packed later during the night. Two bartenders were staffing the bar and the cheese/salami plates tonight, so they could get a little inattentive due to the crowd. PROS:I love the happy hour pricing! For $28 a bottle or $8 a glass. Four bottles to choose, two reds, one white, and one rose. I got the white and she got the rose. Wines were great, and the bartenders allowed us to sample before we ordered the drink. We also ordered the three plates with two meats with cheeses ($15). Gota total selection of seven or eight, and we got the gypsy salami and prosciutto. Those were fantastic. We got their creamy cheese which was really smooth and good. OVERALL:Will be coming back to LELAbar for more date nights and other celebrations!"

The simple yet classy interior sets the mood for the place. The space consists of a large oval bar serving customers with delicious food and wine. The bartenders here are hospitable, welcoming and have complete knowledge of all the wines they serve. We started off with a glass of Cider and a Rosé. We paired our drinks with their House Marinated Olives which had a delicious taste of lemon zest. With some suggestions from the bartender we were set with our next dishes. We got the Smoked Salmon which was served alongside a  delectable Wasabi Oil Soy Sauce. The salmon had a beautiful smoky flavor which was perfectly balanced by the sauce. Next up was the Beet Root Carpaccio and the Truffle Toast. These were the star dishes of our night and we definitely recommend them to everyone. The Beet Root Carpaccio is served with a generous drizzle of truffle oil and crushed pistachio. The Truffle Toast is absolutely beautiful aesthetically and packs a punch of all that flavorful truffle. These two dishes are a must have and you'll surely be wanting for more.We ended our meal with the Chocolate Truffle which was basically like a cherry on the icing for our amazing experience here."

We had a great time and a lot of that had to do with our great bartender James. He knew a lot about wine and gave us a lot of good recommendations. The wine we tried was all solid and from all over.  I am not normally a white wine drinker but we also liked the one he poured us. I think it was a chardonnay but not sure. The red wine was ridiculous. So good. The bar set up is a circle island style bar and it pretty much covers the whole place. They have a small bathroom in back and thats about it. They also have a small food menu with little bar snacks. We didnt get to try but I am sure they were good. Overall, the experience was awesome. The red wine is awesome and James the bartender was the man. We will definitely be back!"

It doesn't matter if you're lactose intolerant, ordering the tirokafteri sauce is a requirement. And way superior to basic tzatziki and the russian dressing they call kalamaki sauce. The pita slices underneath the pork soaked up the juices, which transformed them into pillows of umami and butter. Delicious. The fries were crispy unlike many other greek places, but the lemon potatoes weren't as lemon-y as I'd like. The pork kalamaki was cooked perfectly, and the portions are filling but on the expensive end. That said, it's entirely worth it, and I'll come back to order it because everything was so well done. The food was easily better than other greek places that serve pork kebab platters. The service was bad. The server was very friendly, however she seemed to be inattentive. She seated us, and we just sat there for 10 minutes before accepting that she wasn't going to come back with a menu, so we walked up to the counter and obtained menus ourselves. The table next to us, who walked in seconds before us, was already set up with appetizers. After ordering water, it took nearly 10 minutes for the server to bring two cups out. She also brought a cup stuffed with 6 napkins and over 10 straws. Not sure why the two of us needed that many straws, but okay. After that, despite briskly walking past our table many times, no server/busboy ever stopped to refill our empty cups. 10 straws, 2 cups of water? Math doesn't check out. Who knows, maybe she was super sleepy that day. Despite having bad service from an otherwise friendly server, the food is just that good, so I'll be stopping by for take-out just to taste some of that tirokafteri sauce in the future."

Some nights there are live bands. Once a year they have their version of American Idol called Sunnyside Idol. Competition is fierce and the talent is amazing. They have board games, books and tv on the nights there is no live entertainment. They hire good solid bartenders that mix a good drink and pour a good Guinness. They have a selection of beers that should please most people. Courtyard also makes an alcoholic mango drink that is like crack. You drink it way to fast and always want more. That is a special drink that they don't always have but is well worth it. Their prices are good This is an old-school NYC bar there is no table service. So don't sit down and expect someone to come over. Go to the bar. Half of the people in the bar are neighborhood crew. Some of them banned from other bars in the neighborhood. As long as they keep behaved the bartenders let them stay. Underage drinking is frowned upon so if they aren't sure they don't let you drink. Drugs are frowned upon which is amusing because the neighborhood nickname for the place is coke yard. The back has a smoking section that closes at 2am. There is no food but like all NYC bar you can order in if you want. OR better yet the best taco truck in nyc is in front of CY until they sell out. And the neighborhood has a few late night places to choose from. Overall the drinks are cheaper than some of the other places in Sunnyside. There is a mixture of people. A selection of drinks and it's a place for a good solid night if you want. Don't expect a posh place. It isn't but it's also not a dive bar."

Though small and narrow, it's one of the few versatile Irish bars that can be a quiet place to play board games one night to enjoying a Giants game another night. On occasion they'll have live musical acts here or soccer viewings - you just never know what kind of a night you'll get here. The recent renovation has given the bar a nice face lift, one that makes the place super inviting and looking very spiffy.Happy hour is rarely dull or crowded. The drinks are of average pricing, but nothing is too expensive here. Since they don't offer food, I've seen folks bring in tacos from the Tacos El Vagabundo (yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-va…) truck, happily feasting away on drunk food while downing a pint. There's nothing like a burrito and a pint of Guinness, late night breakfast of champions.I dig their game nights during the weeknights and I love it when they have fight nights / soccer nights, which brings in a nice crowd almost always. Whenever they have live bands, the place can get crazy loud, it may be best to keep the drinking action toward the front to avoid the cluster of people.Service has always been nice. The bartenders know how to make a stiff drink (especially upon request) and have a great sense of humor. All walks of life are in here as a result and since bars are only as good as their bartenders, the Courtyard is easily among the best in Sunnyside."

My family have been ordering from this place for years and most of the time it was pretty good.Then, after a few years, it really started to decline. For starters, a few years ago I went there with my dad, two of my friends and their dad. Nothing crazy, just 5 people. We were older at that point so we weren't being crazy or anything either. The food was good, and all was well until we got the check. Now, this place isn't too cheap, but the prices are reasonable. We got the check and we found out we were charged extra because we were a ""party"". I would get it if there were 7+ people and we were all asking for refills and screaming the whole time, but there were 5 people. two adults and three 10 year old kids. We weren't difficult or anything so I just don't get why they charged us extra. Anyhow, on a more recent note we get their food for dinner on buy one get one night, and it's been alright overall but they get something wrong almost every time. I usually get a chicken francese hero, and there aren't any problems with it, it tastes really good, and I have leftovers for tomorrow. Except for one time. That time was the time I got a regular chicken cutlet (yes, not the francese cutlet, the regular breaded one they use for chicken parmesan) with francese sauce on it. That actually happened twice. It was still good, but it wasn't what I ordered. To add to that, my dad, who got the food, said it was oppressively hot in the building. Like sahara temperatures. My mom got baked ziti and my dad some type of chicken. My mom said her baked ziti was subpar, and my dad said his chicken was inedibly dry. In conclusion, I like their food, but it would be amazing if they got the orders right every time."

Not too salty or too cheesy but everything was the exactly the right amount! The mussels were my least favorite but  it was still very good. It was a tad bit salty but still enjoyable. I would definitely recommend to anyone to come try this place out. I will definitely be returning and if you are looking for a safe place to eat outside the out door seating is definitely 6 feet apart and comfortable!

Like many Id agree the pizza is amazing here but why give a place 1 star for delivery issues? I just don't understand why one would deduct that many stars. Coal or wood fired pizza needs to be eaten in the restaurant as soon as it comes out of the oven. On to the review.The dough is unlike anything around. Not too thick and not too thin but just right. Pizza connoisseurs often talk about the ""chew"" of a good pizza and you'll clearly see what they mean when you stuff you face with Goodfella's.The oven here is also sort of a rarity for Staten Island. Not many coal or wood burning ovens around these parts. The ""char"" adds another level of flavor to the crust. I'm a crust guy.Each time I go to one of the two locations I usually stick to a 12"" personal pie which is enough for me to pig out on. Their specialty pies are pretty creative and I highly suggest you try the mushroom pie, vodka pie which is amazing, and the white pie which is other worldy.Ive never had any issues with the servers and the prices are on point.

We open the pizza and it looks like it has been sitting in the box for a while and tastes warm at best. And on top of it they put the salad and the wings in the same bag making the salad hot!! I am VERY disappointed with the service and the food. I plan on calling tomorrow to speak to a manager. I DO NOT recommend ordering from here."

The pizza tasted dry, what was suppose to be thin crust was inconsistent and the dough got very thick towards the crust portion. It didn't taste fresh and light and there wasn't enough sauce. I also felt that they overcooked the prosciutto and it lost its freshness it suppose to have!Living in Brooklyn, which I personally think we have some of the best pizzerias....and Born in Staten Island I was very upset with the quality. They need to take a look at there recipe and change a few things.Would not come back, wouldn't order again. Cash/Credit accepted, nothing cozy or special about the decor."

This specific place was pretty good and everything as alright. I got my favorites which was the baked potato with bacon/cheese and the spicy chicken nuggets. They tasted great and I really like them a lot. I've missed them and luckily this specific Wendy's didn't fail to disappoint. The service was alright not the most friendly, but they were still efficient and quick in what they do. This must be due to the long line and + it's the covid pandemic right now so I can imagine it to be stressful. Other than that, I think that this place deserves more than what it deserves!"

My friend and I ordered a whole plain cheese pizza pie. It looked promising since it had basil. It came out hot and fresh. However, the pizza was basically burnt on the bottom. I didn't eat most of the crust which I actually enjoy. Also, the sauce was a bit bland so I put a lot of seasoning (oregano, red pepper flakes, garlic powder). Service was fast and friendly. Would I come back? Probably not. I think I expected too much from ""Best Pizza."""
1872,nqXvLzqzQQTJ2eMPkAcojw,12/26/2022,4 star rating,This place has been around for a very long time.  Didn't realize that this place was literally around the corner from my sisters place.  We would walk over here to grab a slide when I'm visiting from out of town.  It's our go to catch up place- we have a slice we catch up and then head to our next stop afterwards.  It's a great spot for their cheese slice and I always have a side of salad with it.

This is actually the best pizza I've had in my life, full stop.I was eyeing the pepperoni slice, but the Brooklyn friends that I went with recommended I get the cheese instead, and it turned out to be the right call.The cheese slice at Best Pizza is perfection. Just the right amount of cheese, nicely balanced sauce that is neither too sweet nor tangy, charred but not burnt bottom, thin and light crust.I didn't know how good a simple cheese slice could be until I had a bite, and my life has been changed.Until next time Best Pizza. I'll never stop dreaming about you."
1874,nqXvLzqzQQTJ2eMPkAcojw,6/12/2022,5 star rating,"tl;dr the well-executed Grandma square is the highlight of this traditional, NY-style slice shop, even if the pizza falls just short of being the ""best""Best Pizza opened its doors in 2010, founded by Brooklynite and Roberta's alumnus Frank Pinello, now better known as the host for The Pizza Show on Vice. With a name like ""Best Pizza"", a business immediately opens the door for scrutiny. Yet, this hole-in-the-wall joint rose to the occasion and garnered rave reviews across New York media outlets and Barstool Sports alike.At first glance, Best Pizza looks like any of the other NYC shops claiming to serve the ""best"" slices. The worn-metal, cherry-red sign pops against the hunter-green exterior. Inside, the off-white Victorian-style walls are lined with artwork sketched on paper plates. A single shelf on the left holds assorted knick-knacks including a Jesus statuette, a laminated Best Pizza news feature, and a custom Best Pizza wooden traffic sign. Black wooden tables are paired with thrifted seats indoors, while fabric lawn chairs are pressed against mismatched patio tables just outside. A small pie display is placed on the ordering counter in the back, and the walls echo with old-school R&B. In the summer, the pizza ovens leave the shop swelteringly toasty.I stopped by for weekday lunch, and a handful of locals were slowly trickling through. I was able to order immediately, and the helpful staff were happy to engage in conversation and indulge my request for 2 super hot slices: a Pepperoni slice and a Grandma square. For the former, I enjoyed the super-thin crust, charred on the bottom without erring on burnt, although I wish it had a bit more flavor when sans toppings. The slice sported a slightly-too-thin layer of cheese and large, not-overwhelmingly-greasy pepperoni rings. The star of the meal, though, was the grandma square. Its thicker, more flavorful crust was crisp on the bottom and pillowy in the middle, as (or more) impressive than any other square I've had in the city. Bubbles of crisp cheese were dolloped with notably sweet, basil-y tomato sauce and cooked basil. Best Pizza has plenty of competition around Williamsburg, and I'd be lying if I called Best Pizza my favorite pizza even within a 10-block radius. But at $10 for quick service and 2 darn good slices, Best Pizza remains a solid addition to the neighborhood and a worthwhile visit for any pizza fan."
1875,nqXvLzqzQQTJ2eMPkAcojw,8/10/2022,5 star rating,"Went for a few slices at Best Pizza on Sunday afternoon. The Cheese Slice is among the best I've had, but it is also worth trying some of their other unique takes.Quality: Definitely among the best slices you can get in the NYC. I had bites of a Cheese, White, Grandma, and Veggie Slice. The highlight is definitely the Cheese, a no nonsense pie with a little basil, perfect crisp, and excellent sauce. The White slice was unique with sesame seeds and a very different sauce than a typical White slice, but it worked. The Grandma is a must for those who enjoy a little more dough. Loved the large chunks of tomato, and they nailed the crispy edges. I wasn't crazy about the Veggie Slice, but it is unlike any slice I've had before.Quantity: Standard NY Slices, the Grandma slice was hefty.Value: $3.75-$4.75 for a Slice.Ambiance: Best Pizza is located in the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn. An old sign sits above the small shop with two tables out front. Inside there are about six more tables and an ordering window. Along most of the walls hung paper plates with various customer artwork. Everything feels old school and authentic.Crowd: Busy on Sunday afternoon, with a flow of traffic.Service: Constantly moving pizzas out the door.Parking: A few spots in front of the shop."
1876,nqXvLzqzQQTJ2eMPkAcojw,9/5/2022,4 star rating,"Does Best Pizza have the best pizza? That's up for debate, but their plain slice is one of the best I've had in Williamsburg. The shop is situated on a quiet section of Havemeyer Street, away from the busy Metropolitan Ave a few blocks south. That doesn't seem to matter though, because there are always other customers eating in or waiting for takeout whenever I stop by.A whole cheese pie is a pretty good deal at $25.00 plus tax for eight large slices. The sauce has just the right amount of sweetness to complement the cheese, and the crust is crispy and chewy. They tend to burn the edges of the crust, which I'm personally not a huge fan of, but it isn't charred to the extent that it's inedible. Their grandma slice is tasty too, but not worth the extra dough, so I'd recommend sticking with the plain.The staff is friendly and wait times for pickup are reasonable. I wouldn't go out of my way for Best Pizza, but if you're in Williamsburg and in the mood for a quick slice, you should give them a try."

Just made a face when I walked in  . When I placed my order he proceeded to make the drink without even asking me any milk choices or my personal specifications. He was behaving like he's doing a favor by making me the coffee lol . It was an average coffee . I don't understand the raving reviews . I've had better ones .

Their coffee comes from Counterculture (always a good option), and they have a variety of pastries. While I was there, I had an americano and a cranberry scone; the scone was recommended by the barista, and it turned out to be a good recommendation. The only downside is that there's not that much indoor seating, just a few tables that can fit a couple people each. Since I had some time to kill before a meeting, I wanted to relax and read a bit, so I had some trouble finding a good place to sit. This isn't a big deal and wouldn't be a problem for someone just trying to take coffee and a pastry to go!"

My boyfriend and I tried the hot & spicy scallop roll, the spicy tuna roll, the lobster roll, the toro scallion roll and the wagyu roll. All of the rolls were carefully crafted before our eyes while we sipped on dry white wine and Japanese beer. The fish was fresh and the atmosphere felt high end and peaceful. We particularly loved the option to choose between sitting at the sushi bar or at a table (it shows the versatility of the restaurant). We definitely want to return soon!"

Located in a walking distance in Manhattan, so glad we decided to stop in. Not too busy when we got in and it was a small place, so I can see it getting busy. Small, bar type sushi area, as well as menu, but straight to the point. It was very fresh, high quality sushi. The spicy blue crab hand roll was to die for, I wanted more! I will definitely be back when I'm in town again!"

Their lunch special is amazing ($26 for an app, 4 nigiri, and 2 hand rolls!!), but if you're on the go, their combo boxes are perfect!I've done lunch a handful of times for the good deal, but sometimes I find myself ordering delivery. Most of the time, I opt to make my own combo box with salmon avocado, spicy salmon, shrimp avocado and tuna cucumber. The spicy salmon was my favorite and honestly I can probably eat a whole box full of those!!! I've also tried one of their pre-made boxes, Bondi's Best, which features spicy blue crab, salmon cucumber, shrimp avocado and truffle avocado. The fish tastes so fresh, and I honestly prefer these handrolls over others that I've tried. The pre-selected combo boxes range from $16-22, with the build your own box priced at $25. The restaurant is super clean and everything always tastes amazing!"

I tried the salmon jalapeño (very spicy but good), crab avocado (my absolute favorite), and two classics, the salmon avocado and yellowtail scallion rolls. All four rolls were delicious! I decided to try their cauliflower rice instead of regular sushi rice or brown rice. It was very filling,  which was a plus, but is it good as actual rice? No. I think it would've been better if they used a little less cauliflower rice so that it didn't take away from the fish. However, I'd still order it again if I wanted a lower carb sushi option!"

A professional and helpful manager seated us quickly at the sushi bar (Jose I think was his name?). We ordered a mix of nigiri, sashimi and hand rolls. The fish was soooo fresh and delicious. We ended up chatting politely with the sushi chef and he definitely over-stuffed our hand rolls with extra fish to be kind. I think the chef said that the unagi avocado hand roll was his favorite and I was really delicious. I would return again."

The sushi quality isn't as good, and for how much you're paying, I expected more. I built my own box and had the salmon avocado, spicy crab, spicy salmon, and California roll. I don't eat a lot, so it was pretty filling. The packaging is pretty and minimalistic, and it also allows for easy clean up and disposal.

They also have some fresh bowl options as well as fruit, snacks, juice shots, and beverages pre-packaged in their refrigerator. Social distancing is enforced well.

The location is in a really good spot, inside the decor is lacking but it's alright. The lighting was fairly dull that's why I judged lol. For starters I got the chicken somosas and the tofu one.

You can taste generations in the recipes.Namaste seems to be a popular take out place on seamless but if you can, try eating there in person for the freshest experience.It's a hidden gem and it shouldn't be.

Food arrived piping hot pretty quickly. The garlic naan was DELICIOUS - regretted only ordering one. Chicken tikka masala was perfect: chicken pieces were tender and moist. Gobhi manchurian had just the right amount of breading with a perfectly balanced sweet and sour sauce. The saag paneer was a tad disappointing because it was slightly dry and flavorless- the paneer pieces were bigger chunks than other Indian places and a bit harder than I'm used to. Would absolutely order the garlic naan, gobhi manchurian, and chicken tikka masala again, but I don't think I'll give their saag paneer another try."

All Pret A Manger restaurants have a wide selection of food, but not for those who want a hearty meal. Their sandwiches are egregiously overpriced for the quantity offered.They want you to order ample food and waste more money - this is why their servings are so tiny. The coffee is very good and the staff is ok - some seem less enthused to be working at the establishment."

1983,FwPKY2uds5Wx2sj7fo6vHQ,3/16/2019,1 star rating,"On a trip to New York, we were going to try this for breakfast and brought our food up to the counter to pay. At first the girl behind the counter ignored us but after awhile that got awkward so she called for another employee to help. She yelled to him.--""There's a customer, I can't be helping them because I'm going to be off soon. Come up here."" Really? He came up not really knowing what to do, he'd been sweeping up and evidently didn't serve customers. Awkward but we still wanted to buy our breakfast food. We said all the coffee was gone and asked him if there was any freshly brewed. But he didn't know about the coffee and called for someone in back.By now it was clear that Pret A Manger doesn't train their employees--customer service is not important. We gave up and left, then stopped at a nearby bakery, and what a difference. They greeted us warmly and were glad to see us. That's the way it should be. Do yourself a favor and avoid this location."

Due to the mixed reviews, I wasn't sure if I wanted to waste my time and money trying this place, but one morning while visiting, I wanted a quick breakfast, so my daughter and I tried it. I was pleasantly surprised! Their lattes were very good. And although their food appears to be prepackaged, it was still very good. I recommend this place if you want a break from Starbucks and need a coffee and quick breakfast!"

EVEN IF YOU DON'T READ THIS ENTIRE REVIEW, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU WANT A VISIT TO CONEY ISLAND EMERGENCY ROOM WITH FOOD POISONING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! These people are shameless!!!!!!!!!!!So, it used to be a good place. Then... something changed. They are not only rude, obnoxious, and care nothing about their loyal customers, there is no loyalty with these people, but their delivery guy (speaks not a word of English) zooms up and down sidewalks at high speeds on a motor bike, almost running over children, the elderly, and children, caring nothing about their safety.  With terrible business, they cannot afford to be so arrogant.  This is not the place for locals, this is one of those ""tourist wondered in"" places and then ""had bad food poisoning"" place.  After being a loyal customer for many years, I had food poisoning year ago. Anyone who is thinking of going to this place, BEWARE.  They are always empty, for a good reason, so think, the fish they buy they don't sell out, so you'll end up eating it days later.  They are dishonest too.  This is perhaps the WORST sushi place in the neighborhood.  Two people I know got food poisoning from them, one was a child.  What you think, they cared? No! Stay away and if you really want sushi, go to Umi across the street on Brighton Beach Ave.  Umi is a much better place, with much more polite service, better quality sushi, and they value your business.  There is a wonderful waitress, Wendy at Umi, go there and tell them that I recommended them, and they'll treat you like gold. Any time a good loyal customer refers a client, they are so gracious and nice. They will value your business unlike these ingrates.  Their delivery guy really should be locked up and behind bars.  He is some kind of criminal.  And I am starting to see that the entire operation there is more than fishy.  No pun intended."

It took them a while to ask for our order and to also to give us the check at the end.The whole ambiance of this place used to be lively and very welcoming. Chinese-owned sushi joints are very typical when it comes to lack of customer service and hygiene. It's sad to even go somewhere else when you are steps away from these joints but unfortunately for this place, they've lost a loyal customer."
1997,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,10/22/2017,2 star rating,"We came on a Friday night and ordered two bento boxes and a side roll. After we waited about 25 minutes for the food, we got a bit antsy. The waiter said ""The sushi is ready. Do you guys want to eat that first?"", well...yeah. So we ate the sushi and waited another 30 minutes for the bento boxes. We had no updates at all from the staff as to why the bento boxes took so long. Literally, at the 30 minute mark, I got up and just asked for the check and to cancel the bento boxes since it took way too long. The waitress said ""Its just about to be finished now."" and we agreed to wait. I saw her go to the back and finish prepping it. It was mainly a bad experience because of the wait. It was excruciatingly long. I understand that you get a lot of orders coming in, but it's a Friday night. I would expect there to be enough chefs to control demand. One hour to wait for bento boxes is too long. The bento boxes were average. Sushi was eh. I wouldn't really consider coming back due to the timeliness."

My husband usually picks up breakfast from Mc Donald's on his way home from working a double shiftThis location I have been going to for years. Maybe the owner should take a good hard look at who he hires to be in charge while he's not there. Very Angry

2001,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,12/2/2019,1 star rating,"Came in one day after placing a mobile order. I guess it's too much trouble to expect the person behind the counter to hand me my drink cup along with my bag of food. When I asked for it, because you know, I paid for it, the woman gets nasty with me and says I should have asked for it at the register so I'm not 'waiting' around for it.I'm sorry...what? I placed a damn mobile order so I could get in and get out. That's what the mobile ordering app is for. You're telling me to either wait on a damn line to get something I ordered from the cashier (which defeats the damn purpose of SKIPPING THE  LINE AND PICKING UP AT THE ORDER WINDOW) or I should walk over to the cashier while she's helping people and basically tell the customer she's helping at the time: ""F_K you I'm going ahead of you because I placed a mobile order""?, instead of just giving me the f_ing cup WITH my order???  What f_ing sense does this make?And to make matters worse, I believe the woman who told me this is a manager...And btw, she's the only one who has ever said this to me. Every time I go in there to pick up an order all I do is say ""Can I have the drink cup?"" and the girls (who are always very polite) hand it to me with NO ISSUES.  No one but her has ever told me to go wait on a line after placing a mobile order."

2006,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,11/30/2019,1 star rating,"So we just ran in to get the kids something quick to eat. When we came in, the place is wry clean and it seemed as though everything was organized. After ordering at the kiosk, my tray was delivered and my drink cup was missing. I walked up to the counter and asked the manager who wasn't  really paying attention and said the  cups are at the register. I explained once again that my mail had already been delivered however the cup was missing from my tray and I was asking the server who brought it to me. The manager once again was extremely dismissive never made eye contact and continue to talk to her staff while I was having this conversation with her. At that point we went back to the table after I got my cup and went to go take soda from the soda fountain. The soda was flat, everyone at the fountain was talking about how flat the soda was so we all went up there to say that the machine was broken. Once again being very dismissive and never turning in even looking at us she said yeah the Coke is broken it's it's the Coke I don't know it's broken. And continue to go on with her work we were dumbfounded and said maybe that should be told to us before we're purchasing cups it's not just the Coke it's all of the soda is broken. The manager again was quite dismissive never answered us never addressed the concern she was ordering  around the employees which to me is quite embarrassing. I feel like maybe the manager in this location May need some training on communication.I am a paying customer, and I don't pay to be made to feel uncomfortable."

I was happy to be able to park my car for a slight additional charge. The staff was helpful and the breakfast was good. I was happy they used real plates and silverware. They have a nice rooftop area where you can sit and enjoy your drink or meal ( if you happen to have one with you ) and take in the astonishing view.
2010,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,7/14/2022,4 star rating,"We chose this hotel as it was rated top 10 Hotel in NY in You Tube.  We booked a room for our 7 day stay. Our first impression walking in is that it was clean and staff were welcoming,helpful and friendly. We got there before check in and thank God a room was ready. Room was clean, beds were comfortable and rooms are cleaned daily .  Breakfast is included with your stay. Good breakfast, only thing I would recommend is a microwave either in the rooms if not then one the guest can use to warm up food. Lastly regarding the dinning room that didn't look good is the tablecloths were never folded so they were placed wrinkled and that was not good presentation.  Just a thought. Other than that food was great. They also have washer and dryers for guest to use. Location was perfect, short walk  to a corner market and to subway station. I would recommend this hotel and plan to stay here again. Thank you everyone!"

2012,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,12/20/2021,5 star rating,We stayed here on Sunday December 12. We needed a last minute hotel for ONE night because of a funeral - we found this hotel online and after reviewing other hotels - this place seemed like the one to go with so we chose a pre-pay option through an online site. Let me tell u - this place is the place to stay!! I'm not going to lie - it is small - don't show up with a week full of luggage- BUT - it has everything necessary and was CLEAN! Even the water pressure in the shower was awesome!!! It comes with a continental breakfast which was perfect!! And ALL the staff was soooooo nice. Parking was only $20 bucks but it's a very small lot and first come first serve so we checked in right at 3pm and walked everywhere for the night. And It's right by the bridge to get into NYC . It was perfect and stress free! We will stay here again!
2013,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,11/28/2021,5 star rating,"Great value and the lowest prices I could find in the city.  Our room was very basic but clean and comfortable.  The in-room heater was extremely efficient.  Staff was always super friendly.  Twice our key cards stopped working for no reason, but staff resolved the issue immediately.  Breakfast was included (bagels, toast, pancakes, sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, yogurt, granola), not great quality but staff was really friendly and gave us big portions.  Tea, coffee, and water available all day.  Gym in the basement was very sparse but nice that it was available for use.  The rooftop had beautiful views of both Manhattan and Queens at night.  They were also very forgiving when we accidentally stayed past checkout.  This will be our new go-to place to stay in NYC!"
2014,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,5/23/2018,2 star rating,"Upon arrival at the hotel and check-in, the women at the front desk began speaking in Spanish to one another about our room. Little did they know I know some Spanish and I understood that both rooms they had available were equally ""bad"". That already left a bad taste in my mouth. We walked back out of our room which was okay-small bathroom, dirty towels (hair in them and some were stained with what seemed like blood ). Upon walking out, I had a question for the woman at the front desk; however, she was taking a personal call and did not even look up until I told my husband it isn't worth asking her our question. She eventually asked what we needed, but was rude about it. At night when we turned on our air conditioner it made loud noises and we could not sleep with it on. So instead we uncomfortably slept in a warm hotel room. Also, the women at the front gave us the wrong time as to when breakfast began and ended. This hotel had potential, but it's disappointing to see the utter lack of customer service, the lack of cleanliness (dirty towels!!!), and an air conditioner that was super loud. (Also breakfast seemed sketchy-so we didn't actually eat it). All in all, I would not stay here again-ever."

2016,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,5/6/2017,3 star rating,"In general, this hotel is decent. The room is with decent space. We stayed at the two twins bed room. Everything is clean. Bathroom is a bit small especially its sink. Breakfast is included, which is always a plus. Two complaints though. We were assigned a room by the major street which is on the same side as the major entrance. It was very very loud at night every time when a car passed by. It might not be the company's fault but with the situation given, the experience would be so different especially when you can't get a good sleep before you go sightseeing. The window in the room doesn't really block anything. I'd suggest to check in advance, otherwise you will not have a good experience. Almost all their staff was very friendly and helpful, like most of the Yelp reviews. However, there was a lady at the front desk was very impatient about answering questions and showed no concerns or empathy about the loud room they provided. The worst part of this was that she told me all their rooms were booked so no exchange for a new room; but later on the same day, another staff told me there were two available rooms we can switch to if we want. Wasn't really sure what's going on earlier then. My experience made me feel like this hotel is over rated. It doesn't mean they are not a good hotel. I care much about the service, so a rude staff would greatly downgrade my decision."

It took me over 2 months to book a hotel I felt was good enough for me, and by good enough I mean clean, affordable and near all landmarks (my first time in NYC).After reading many posts from other hotel reviews I was terrified at the thought of dealing with bed bugs, roaches, rats and just a dirty room overall. Thankfully, LIC Hotel was nothing like it. I had not one issue during my stay. The staff was always friendly. A free breakfast was offered from 6:30 to 10 a.m. every morning.  My room/bathroom were spotless clean. Though my room was not the biggest and luxurious, it had everything I needed. The rooftop was simple but offered a great view. At a nearby corner (a block away or so), there is access to the subway which made it easier to  get around. I will definitely be returning to this hotel!"

2019,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,1/6/2023,5 star rating,"Extraordinary experience! As a pereson who lives in Los Angeles, I've had plenty of Tacos in the past. This twist of Indian style taco was surprisingly good. From their naan bread to curry - they are all delicious to begin with so combining it like a taco was a no brainer! We stopped by after having a slice of pizza and it was still good...!There are about 4-5 tables (including the high table) inside and there are plenty of outside seating. Go with your family for a quick bite and you won't regret if you love Indian food. Thank you, Taco Mahal for creating such delicious menus."

This is a must-order. I also tried the chicken tikki masala and while it was good; the chicken was a little dry so I prefer to have the paneer. The tiki masala was on the sweeter side. I got this on the roti and 100% recommend getting the naan bread every single time. The roti was good but the one on the naan was exponentially better.  I also tried the samosas which were fine, I would not order them again. But I will definitely be back for a saag paneer on naan!"

2022,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,2/14/2023,5 star rating,"Located in the heart of West Village, NYC, Taco Mahal has excellent Indian food wrapped with roti or naan of your choice. Sometimes you want to go out and have Indian food with friends and hang out; without the formality of sitting in a restaurant where you are forced to interact with someone immediately next to or in front of you. Sometimes, you want that Indian and Mexican fusion! This is it! I honestly didn't have expectations from the food other than wanting a new way to eat Indian food, and I was so happy with the taste. Aside from the food, I also liked that I could order it, and they brought it outside to the table, so I didn't have to wait by the counter for it. These little added considerations do go a long way in my books. If you like to go on a sunny day like I did but don't like the cold, they have pre-set ceiling heaters, so you never feel the cold. I don't know about you reading this post; I am returning for more!"

Been seeing this chicken tikka masala taco online.They had some tables inside and some in the outside covered area. Food takes about 10min to come out. Staff is friendly.The taco was great! It came out piping hot, and the sauce was delicious. It was slightly overpriced, I though. You don't get a huge taco for $10.50 (chicken tikka w garlic nan). Mango lassi was sweet and tasted kind of like yogurt! We enjoyed. It's a thick drink though!"
2025,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,12/21/2022,5 star rating,I was skeptical of Taco Mahal going in because Indian fusion is often hard to execute. However there's nothing to be concerned about here! The staff is super friendly and had good recommendations. My favorite was the chicken tikka naan taco. I substituted the regular naan for a garlic cheese naan and it went perfectly with the tangy Tikka masala sauce. Highly recommend checking this place out if you're in midtown!

I want to learn how to make this it's so good. The cheesy naan is so good in every bite. The lamb was great. The curry yum. It's a little messy but so good. The naan bread is so fluffy. It all came out piping hot so it's so fresh and ready for you. I loved this place and I will absolutely be back.
2027,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,2/28/2023,2 star rating,"Taco Mahal is a fast-casual restaurant with a Chipotle-like spin on Indian cuisine. You can choose to have their options on a roti taco, naan taco, bowl, or entree serving. My friend opted for a Chicken Malai Kabob Bowl, while I got the Chicken Tikka Masala on a Roti Taco and a Saag Paneer on a Roti Taco. Although I liked the concept, I feel like I should've gotten naan instead of roti, since both of my tacos broke after one bite. The chicken tikka masala and the saag paneer were perfectly spiced but felt overwhelmed by the additional toppings, especially the purple onion(?). I think this came out a lot more clearly with the bowl, where all the flavors didn't feel like they belonged together. The chicken malai kabob was dry, and all the flavors combined still felt like... no flavor? All in all, although I really liked the flavor of the actual curry, I felt like the amount of stuff in each item should be pared down to really accentuate the key dish more."

It smells sooooooooo bad in here. The flavors are decent but it's nothing that you couldn't get at any other Indian restaurant. I got the chicken tikka masala, which tasted just like butter chicken. This place is over hyped and not worth the money. The lamb curry was okay. Update: the new wings (they replaced 2) were just as badThe health department needs to look into why this place smells like actual crap."

I will continue to order from them!To emphasize how reasonable he was, I will note that I don't get reasonable accommodations when due about 90% of the time.

But tossed in my salad with dressing and everything) who would want anymore food at that point. When I went to get the food the delivery man had a frown and An attitude. I asked did he receive his tip and he ignored me. I then I tried to show him a photo of the salad with the napkin and he walked away.

As a chef, I love trying new food and eating in places that people have declared pleasant. I took a chance on Famous Amadeus Pizza and I regret that decision. I ordered two pies, a chicken/ bacon with chorizo plus a caprese; both 12"". More food than I needed but it wanted to try both flavors. As I ate the first pizza, i bit into something hard and pulled it out of my mouth immediately. It ended up being sausage casing from the Portuguese chorizo with STAPLES in it. Exhausted from my flight in, I laid down for an hour and woke up to call the restaurant. I spoke to 3 people before getting a manager who asked me several different questions (in order to prove that I didn't get the pizza from there). After confirming the order number, the order name, what time i ordered, the site i ordered on and my phone number, Jose tells me I should have talked to the morning crew because my pizza was ordered at 5:50 and his team didn't come in until 6. When I told him I picked it up at 6:20, he got quiet and said I needed to come back in the morning and talk to the guys that made it. Terrible customer service seeing as how a staple has went into my jaw from a bite of pizza. I'll be following up with health services about this as well. If the had better customer service, I would have taken the refund and kept it pushing."

2059,sswuN6W-p8wpIeQIoGuHmQ,11/11/2021,5 star rating,"Choose your fighter: The Frozen queen or the fabulous cocktail bar? Tough choice, but I suppose I'll go with the more age-appropriate option. Elsa had been on my list for many years before I finally visited last weekend and it was everything I hoped it would be and more. It's often the unassuming types that impress the most. My trip to Elsa may have also been my first trip to Cobble Hill and I was very charmed by the area. While Elsa seems like a cute neighborhood spot, the cocktails and ambiance here rival most of the top spots in the city. Trust me: I love a good speakeasy experience, but if you're going to wait two hours to get in somewhere, you might as well use the time to commute a little further and get something just as great.My fiancé and I visited Elsa after getting dinner nearby. There were a few parties ahead of us in line but we all got seated immediately. The space itself is cute, artsy and feels very down to earth, and it has both the decor and staff to thank for that. When we first sat down, our server assured us that if we didn't like something she'd whisk it right back to the bar and make something else no charge, which was very kind of her. Thankfully, we did not encounter that problem, because absolutely everything here is outstanding. Before diving into our order, I will say that Elsa also appears to attract awesome clientele (us included, I guess). While we were drinking our first round the couple next to us inquired about how we liked our order, and we ended up talking a bunch for the rest of the night. Considering how much my fiancé and I have gone out together over the years, I'm surprised this hasn't happened more, but it's a testament to how warm and friendly Elsa is. For the densest city in the world, we do tend to stay in our little bubbles a lot, so connections like these are just delightful.Okay, so drinks. The menu is pretty big as far as cocktail bars go, so you'll have your work cut out for you. We each ordered two, and all were amazing. We started with a pair of lighter cocktails to start, the Vivian Darkbloom: Charcoal Mezcal, Mint, Lime, Pineapple, Velvet Falernum, Bitters and The Bell Witch: Arugula Gin, Green Chartreuse, Lime, Vermut Negre, Cracked Black Pepper. The Vivian Darkloom was smoky and sweet, perfectly balanced, while the Bell Witch was herbal, floral and citrusy. Stirred drinks were next: My Old So-And-So: Scarlet Ibis Rum, Black Pepper Syrup, Grapefruit and Walnut Bitters and the Mimi's Broach: Uncle Val's Peppered and Botanical Gins, Walnut Liqueur, Bordiga Apertivo, Cherry Bark Bitters. I've made black pepper syrup myself and it's always a fun one to add to cocktails. This one was rich, spiced and nutty. I think I liked the Mimi's Broach slight better (only because the ice cube in the My Old So-And-So watered the drink down too much after a while and it's our fault for letting it sit there for too long), and it was super complex and creative. Honestly, I'd say it's pretty impossible to go wrong here."

Upon arriving out front of Elsa I was happy to see the sign telling patrons the vax cards are a must before entering, and, they do indeed enforce it.Once inside, you realize that Elsa is actually not just your average neighborhood bar. It's sleek and sophisticated. There are small, and intimate feeling tables inside, bar seating, and an outdoor patio. Bartenders are attentive. The menu rotates, from my understanding, and the end of summer/early fall drink options included a nice variety.The drinks are made with care and are certainly aesthetically pleasing. They do have a small food menu, though I didn't try anything off it.  My friend and I only ordered one drink each and sat at the bar (we went after dinner) and didn't feel rushed at all by staff.This is definitely the kind of place to meet a date, or go with a friend or partner.

The chicken sandwich is great too with onions and the herbs they put on it. The broccoli ricotta sandwich probably had a whole head of broccoli on it. Very filling.

How did we know? They put onions and toppings back on, and when he opened it up to take the onions off (he had ordered it without them), his(?) bite was still on it. Frankly it made us a little sick to think about. Like I get inflation and rising food costs, but that's just really bad practice. We also tipped 20% when we paid upfront, so we basically paid $50 for chips and a box of kale (my salad). What a drag."

I had to go up and ask for the specialty butters for my waffles because the server forgot them. The flavored butters are delicious so definitely don't let them forget! Overall, Sweet Chick is a decent fried chicken spot but I don't understand why it is so popular when there are plenty of other options around, with better service."

My biggest complaint is the fact that you can't call and place an order, you must place the order through their website or go in person. Unfortunately on a short lunch break the latter is not an option. I tried for over 10 mins to place an order online which uses door dash as a third party to place orders. There was a glitch causing the system to not be able to use my card as payment, (even though I've ordered from here multiple times) and then made me put in a second card for verification to prove my identity? I use door dash weekly and have dash pass so I'm not a stranger to door dash at all. However sweet chick simply uses door dash as an online platform for placing orders instead of using their own system. My point in all this is it's extremely inconvenient and just lazy as hell in my opinion that it was basically impossible to place an online order because if a door dash glitch that no one can remedy. I called the store and they said no orders over the phone. Someone get me on the phone with someone that matters and we can have a great conversation about this. Until then, I advise avoiding even eating here until this gets sorted out. I'll find somewhere else I can place an order in 30 seconds over the phone. New age crap. Ridiculous"
2083,sswuN6W-p8wpIeQIoGuHmQ,1/8/2023,3 star rating,"I'm conflicted with writing this review. I want to give this place 5 stars bc the food was superb. However, the customer service upon entry was disappointing. As my husband and I walked in, there was a lady staff at the counter. I had to say hello first. I had to ask, as a first time customer, will I be seated or am I supposed to search for a place to sit? She answered and said I could sit anywhere. The place had low lighting, so it took some time for me to actual find an open table. To add to the lack of service, as my husband and I were walking towards the front entry, a waiter (as we later found out) was getting ready to walk into the restaurant as well. He was a few seconds ahead of us. He sees us, enters, and didn't make an effort to hold the door open. We love to support small businesses but unfortunately, more often than not, small businesses in NY doesn't seem to care about delivering exceptional service to their paying customers. I don't seem to understand why. I'll digress. We ordered chicken and waffles. I had honey my husband had original. Also we ordered shrimp and grits. For drinks, I got their sweet chick cocktail and my sugar got tequila lemonade. To end on a good note, The place was clean and cozy."

It was just delicious with dusted powdered sugar, strawberry butter (or raspberry not sure), and maple syrup. The nashville chicken was juicy, flavorful and the right amount of nashville sauce during the first day. The second day I came, the chicken was a bit dry and not as flavorful on the inside and you can barely taste the nashville sauce. I ended up getting a side of nashville sauce but it tasted like a bland melted butter with chili powder. I wished the chicken and sauce was more consistent. Now I'm nervous to come when I'm craving that same chicken I ate from the first day. Please make it the same way each time. Other things that I've tried that are good as well: the shrimp and grits, and the mac and cheese. The hush jalapeño cheddar hush puppies were ok. A bit dry for me. The drinks were ok too...could be better depending who makes it."

Everything was delicious, and that ranch sauce is sooo good."

Every time I pass by this spot, there's always customers sitting both indoors and outdoors and it's always been a spot that I wanted to try. I ordered the sweet chick bucket for take out along with some extra biscuits that came with blueberry jam. The chicken reminds me of KFC batter and was actually pretty small. It was also dry and didn't seem worth it. It came with power slaw and a biscuit as well, which were both okay. The biscuits were pretty fluffy, not too buttery, and pretty good with the jam but overall just decent biscuits. They're pretty popular for their chicken and waffles so maybe try that out instead or their fried chicken sandwiches, which is also next on my list to try from here. They have a breakfast menu on the weekends which they are very diligent about and will not serve anything outside of that until after 12PM."

So-so reviews, but a pretty solid menu with lots of different choices for pies and slices... so my wife and I drove over to check it out.7ish on a Sat night. Only a few slices out and they looked hours old. I didn't see the kind of slice I wanted and when I asked they said they were out of it - but didn't offer to make one. At 7 on a Sat... seems like you'd have a fresh pie out where you could throw a few toppings on a slice, or putting a new pie in would seem worth it with so much of the night left. My wife and I exchanged the ""should we just leave"" look, but we were hungry, so we each got a slice - and while it wasn't that bad, it tasted as old as it looked. Would likely have been much better when it was fresh - like I would have assumed it would be at 7 on a Sat night. I mean they close at 10! Really couldn't throw on a new pie? If they had, we'd have taken two slices each (half the pie) and maybe been back.So, again, ehh. A shame the selection that drew me in wasn't offered."

No tomato sauce...but carmelized onions with breadcrumbs.......I cant get enough of it. Furthermore...their grilled calamari, is delicious.But their obnoxious and rude delivery guy, will ensure that I NEVER order from this place again. The last time he came to deliver into my building, with NO MASK...I called and told them to stop sending him. But tonight, he calls me from downstairs...says he cant seem to find a spot ( there are spots all over my neighborhood)..and says I have to come down ( despite the fact that I am sick in bed, with my robe on). So I let him know he'll have to wait....and when I get downstairs, I tell him that it's not cool to make a sick person have to get dressed to come down for a delivery. Well he looks me in the eye....and tells me to go fck myself. I'm sorry.....fck YOU Andrews. Not cool...and will no longer be patronizing you."

We called to inform them we got the wrong food and the delivery man came back, took the part of the order that was wrong (which I'm not sure is safe during COVID) and gave us a pizza that was not fully cooked so we had to put in the oven to finish cooking. We were still missing one of the items from our order. When we called to tell them this we were told they were ""busy"" and we never received it. With so many better pizzerias in this area I would expect them to be nicer to their customers. Unfortunately, my family and I will not be back to Andrews after how we were treated. P. S.

I was craving for a bagel sandwich and went on a spree searching for places within only a few blocks radius (I was starving, wouldn't have made it if it was anywhere further).  I walked in and the deli was pretty much seated full with some more people waiting for their orders. The hot food buffet immediately caught my eye because everything looked so good and fresh...fresh as in the food doesnt look like its been sitting there for 6 hours and is showing discoloration. There was a large variety and I spent most of my time actually just looking at the hot foods. I ordered the Herb Chicken and Avocado with mozzarella, lettuce and balsamic vinaigrette on a sesame bagel. It came out to only ~$6.80. The chicken was surprisingly juicy and not dry like most places. My only complaint is that I wish the cheese was melted but that's insignificant because everything was perfectly paired and the bagel was generously stuffed, I downed the whole sandwich in a quick 10 minutes! So happy I found this place and can now avoid those $10+ sandwiches in the area. I am definitely returning for hot food and more sandwiches!!"

The chicken teriyaki is so good that after I finished my meal, i went into a coma for all 5 turns. One bite into the sweet potatoes and I saw my life flashing before my eyes.

To be honest the first time was good  satisfying to say the least, but since January between eating in and ordering out about 4 times it's just gone downhill. As far as food the guacamole is great, pretty fresh as is their house salad. Quesidillas are mediocre from the mushroom to chicken but that's really not why this place gets a poor review. For what once might have been potential for Michelin. The restaurants Penny picking is just terrible. It's like paying extra for everything, like the house salsa, something that if You are eating in restaurant should just be comp, with quesildillas usually comes sour cream but no you get up charged for that too. Wait you ordered coffee for BRUNCH you're paying for every cup in an empty restauarant where you just made a pot. I understand the times but if you want customers to come back you cannot nickel and dime them. Ordered from them a couple of times, specifically asked twice to have part of the meal in a separate container because I don't like it but my son does, yet they send it in the same 3 item tray where the delivery guy spills it all over everything else in the meal. Clear directions ignored, tried to resolve it with the owner but he'd rather create excuses than solve the problem. So for a customer that ate here four times in January 2022 who had never eaten here before the experience trended down and they won't be seeing another dollar from myself or my family in the area. Great business model I tell ya."

I just wanted the donut so I asked her and she simply picked it up with tongs and dropped it in my hands - not sure if that works as a safety measure, but it's good to see they are trying to be more sanitary these days."

All cocktails were absolutely excellent, especially the Spicy Margherita which had both, a spice and alcohol kick!For food, we got Green Egg Scramble ($15) and a Veggie Smash Burger ($17).

Bold statement, I know. And I've had a lot of great brunches. But it's that good. It's called a scramble but I feel like it's more of an omelet-salad hybrid - it comes with avocado, kale, feta & chimichurri. Plus the presentation was on point. So let's summarize: I highly recommend the pretty omelet-salad hybrid which has become my new obsession :PThey have indoor/outdoor seating - we sat outside. But their interior design has won some awards I believe. They were on Architectural Digest's list of most beautifully designed bars in each state. Here's a little blurb if you're into this stuff like me:""Designed by Home Studios, the aesthetic has a feel of the old, iconic New York (think Keens and P.J. Clarke's). The horseshoe bar is divided in two, with the front more welcoming for a happy-hour crowd, while the back is more intimate, with charming green leather booths. Enjoy a drink from the extensive whiskey selection while sitting on comfortable custom barstools, which feature upholstery in the pinks and mauves that are true to old Irish pubs.""Fun!"

They clearly don't know what a pre authorization is. Instead of a $7.10 tip they charge me a $71.00 tip. Since I blasted them online they lied to Amex saying I gave them 71.00 tip on a $39.00 charge. CHECK OUT THEIR PROOF. They couldn't produce my ACTUAL credit card receipt so 'as proof' they gave this random invoice where THEY recorded a $71.00 tip. Liars and frauds. Amex refunded me because even they knew these people people committed fraud and lied. Go to another bar. I got my refund will continue to remind people of how they overcharged me $63.90 on a tip.

I started with a dirty martini which is usually my go to drink. It was almost undrinkable. The brine/olives had a really bad taste to them. I had the steak tartare to eat which was wonderful, and a very large portion. Tasted very fresh and flavorful. I then tried the espresso martini (which is on draft) and that was amazing as well! Definitely would recommend trying. Overall I would probably not rush back unless it was for a very early dinner. Gets too busy late at night for a sit down dinner."
2137,Y9ZC2tx4ReQqA40LEPErwQ,3/6/2023,1 star rating,"I have never experienced such terrible service and attitude towards a customer. I was with my family and friends and ordered drinks at the bar. To begin with the bartender, Brian Lerner, had a stinky attitude, so I left him a 15% tip on the first order. When we went to reorder drinks, he purposefully ignored my friend and I for 10 minutes. Finally when we managed to order a drink, Brian set down the drinks and said, ""I will not give you the drinks until you give me a card."" I therefore proceeded and told him I would pay him cash. I was not happy with his condescending manner and had no intention on tipping him for the bad service now. When I collected the cash I was $1 short and had only 4 quarters so I gave them. He proceeded to tell me that he did not accept coins and I told him that is what I had, which was true. The bill was paid in full. I did not purposefully give him coins. He then called over security to escort me out of the bar. Nor was I drunk or being disrespectful. On the contrary, the disrespect and ill attitude all came from Brian. You would think that customers should be treated nicely, but Brian had not a drop of hospitality in his behavior. Maybe he was having a bad day, but that gives him absolutely no right to be disrespectful nor kick me out of the bar. If I was misbehaving, I understand the actions that were taken, but that was not the case. Bartenders like Brian Lerner have no place in the hospitality industry. Whoever hired this person should really reconsider the staff they are hiring. Anyone that comes across this bartender, please run the other way and never hire him to work for you!"

2140,l-oj1yA5liiFEEwoi-1ELA,9/25/2022,1 star rating,"Ugh, I really hate writing bad reviews and I hardly do, but I had an awful time at this establishment. My partner and I came on a Saturday night for date night. Coming into the night, we knew we'd have to wait for an hour or so for a lane, so we prepared to eat while waiting.Upon entering, be prepared to pay cash as the cover fee if they have a band playing for the night. There's nothing on their website that mentions if you plan to just bowl you still have to pay for the tickets, so that caught us off guard. We paid $30 in cash to get in; they don't accept card for entry.At their restaurant we ordered their 1/2 dark chicken which comes with 2 drumsticks, 2 wings, mashed potatoes, and collard greens with bacon. We also ordered a plate of the Mac n cheese. The food was fantastic; the chicken was juicy with a crunchy exterior and the Mac n cheese was super cheesy and gooey.We started running into problems when it came to actually bowling. After finishing our meal, we asked the front desk how much longer until our names will be called. They said there were three groups ahead of us. An hour passes by, so we ask again and it turns out our number was miswritten. Mistakes happen, so we shrug it off.Bowling was fun, and the music was great but more problems arose when we were paying out. The bowling alley closes at 1, so our game was stopped at around 12:56. When we got our check, we saw a total of $10.86 (for just the shoe rental) and thought they comped our bowling time (of approx 30 minutes) due to the mistake from before since it said $0 for that part. We were grateful. Then when we got our check, after giving our card, we saw a final charge of approx $40. We asked the server if this was the wrong charge and he said he gave us the wrong one earlier, which really sucks because we thought different. We asked for the new itemized bill that we charged for, in which the server can't find so they call their manager over. While we're talking to the manager the server then brings over another receipt asking if this was the name on the card. We go to our banking account and see they charged us twice of the $40 charge. The server comes over again and says they removed the first charge with no details of how much we actually paid, and then proceeds to take the checkbook without making sure we signed (which we didn't yet because we wanted to make sure we signed the right receipt with the correct charge). We were only given the paid receipt of the $40 charge. We ended up staying a little bit later again to just get clarification and one of the other managers, Sylvia, helped try to clear things up with us. She said both of the charges would be dropped. I don't know ya'll, the disorganization at the end of the night was very disappointing. We just wanted to leave on a good note. They should have a system where we can see a screen confirming the phone number we put down since the music is so loud. And I know it's closing time, but the servers really shouldn't be rushing to close tabs because it can cause errors like it did with us. We're unsure if we'd come back again."

My 1 year old granddaughter, Mya, who just learned to walk enjoyed running around with all the kids in the lights. They handed put hula hoops to all the kids.

The parachute was also a lot of fun. The place was packed with families. Everyone was having a great time just letting loose and acting like kids with their kids. There was a $15 cover charge that was well worth it. The only unfortunately thing was the they only accepted cash to pay the cover. There was an ATM that they let us use, otherwise we may not have been able to enter.So far as food goes, we ordered the Theresa French Bread pizza. It was delicious!

The food wasn't really to my liking, I wouldn't visit again. The food just didn't taste like what I expected, or like what it usually taste like in different restaurants with the same dish. I don't really know how to explain it, but it just was not that good. I had left overs and didn't even want to take it to go. The best dish was probably the bulgogi combo, you can't really go wrong with some stir fried bulgogi and rice.The staff was kind, but the food was not up to par. The food did come out super quick and come with an assortment of ban chans. I noticed most people ordered the Korean fried chicken here, so maybe that's what they are good at making. But the other foods just weren't it. Tl;dr - food was disappointing, saw a lot of people get the Korean fried chicken, maybe that's what's good here?"

For the bulgogi, you should choose the spicy version. It was not too spicy and it paired perfectly well with the rice. The Beef Tofu Soup was pretty small. But it tasted amazing and we kept digging in.The manager/ server was very friendly and attentive. Eventhough the food took a long time to prepare, the server kept on check up on us and apologize for the wait.

I should ask if I can just buy a tub of that next time I go in, it was so flavorful and the cabbage still had the perfect bite to it.For my main I got a bulgogi hot stone bowl. It was loaded with beef and a ton of different toppings. The seaweed & marinated eggplant were my favorites. The bottom of the rice was so crunchy, honestly just perfect!

The service is great, the banchan is delicious and homemade, and their tofu soups are exactly what you expect. The prices are high compared to the rest of Chinatown but not when you're talking about good Korean food. Everything is very reasonable and they have great combos such as galbi and tofu soup so you can have a little of both.

Some people may find the ginger one to not have enough flavor and it's understandable because you don't want it to be overpowered with ginger flavor.The drinks in my opinion were overpriced for what they sell. It's expected for their standard soju or beer. I didn't find the service or the waiter/waitress to be accommodating or helpful. The restaurant is really clean and like their bathroom design.

I requested for the buns and sauce to be on the side to avoid a soggy bun, and also ordered a side of onion rings. My meal got to the office and was very well wrapped with the patty and toppings separate from each other, the bun in a different container, and the sauce separate as well. Onion rings also in its own thing. The burger was enjoyable. Nothing too special to make it amazing, but nothing horrible either. It was cooked exactly as I wanted it, and the ketchup and Lucky's sauce added a nice touch. The onion rings were amazing! Again, very impressed with the delivery. I was initially hesitant to order them because I didn't want them to come soggy, but the risk was worth it because they stayed hot and crispy! Delicious and perfect with the burger. Overall, decent burger but not enticing enough to order again (maybe I'd do just onion rings by themselves) when there are so many other options in the city.

I called my own bank to confirm they weren't being used fraudulently and they were not. I was forced to leave because apparently none of my cards worked. The cashier suggested I go to the bank and get paper money. I haven't used paper in years. A bit strange. I had to come to Murray's Bagels for my mid afternoon sandwich.

Despite all that, I went with the Yelp reviews and still gave this place a try. Lucky's offers a variety of different burgers, hot dogs and milkshakes. They also offer a number of different dipping sauces, such as their famous Lucky's sauce. I settled for the Hell's Kitchen burger after reading a tip here on Yelp. The burger was basically sloppy joe in between 2 slices of bread with cheese. Not saying that that's a bad thing. Although it was a messy experience, the burger tasted surprisingly delectable. The fries that they serve here reminded me of the golden crinkly-cut fries over at Shake Shack. They also tasted just as good. I recommend trying all the sauces that they offer here as you will not be disappointed. Overall, my first experience here was decent despite my initial impressions. The staff were courteous and efficient. They also Boylan soda (in bottles and at the soda fountain) here which is a big plus. I showed my alumni ID here to get $1.10 off...only to find out later that they also honor the 10% cashback Yelp deal if you pay with your qualifying debit/credit deal! WIN WIN.

Their special sauce is also a must (even if it is probably just ketchup mixed with mayo). Only taking off a star because of the fries which are similar to cardboard in texture.

I ordered for a delivery at 12:45pm but my food didn't even leave the restaurant until 1:20pm. Whether that's an issue with Grubhub or Marinara I couldn't tell you but I do know that my food didn't hit the hands of a delivery driver until over 30 minutes past when it should've been in my hands. The mozz sticks were actually pretty great! (after I heated them up because they came to me ice cold) They came with a marinara and vodka sauces. The sauces were tasty as well.The pizza however... I'm not sure the cooks at Marinara have heard of yeast in a pizza dough. Whether this was an anomaly of a dough that didn't rise or this is what they want their product to look like is unclear. I mean I was surprised and a little confused that they decided to buy oversized shells from Taco Bell's Mexican pizza for their crusts but who am I to question the Italian authorities at Marinara Pizza. Maybe the culinary minds at this pizza place thought that since New York-style pizza is known for having a thin crust, it might be a competition to see who could produce the thinnest crust. They would certainly be hoisting that trophy with no deliberation needed from the judges. Marinara is a very special place to me in NYC, mostly because there's never been a pizzeria in this city that would make me prefer the frozen works of the Chefs DiGiorgno or Tombstone over a fresh pizza but they've somehow cleared that bar.

I also tried the tricolor sauce square slice with pesto, vodka sauce, and marinara. It was thin and crispy. I scarfed it down so fast I was close to getting another one.

Managed to somehow finish the NY slice, but threw the caprese slice straight into the garbage after 1 bite. I don't even think raccoons would eat it when they find it in the dumpster.

I stopped by here sometime in 2020 and remember being underwhelmed by the MVP (marinara, vodka, pesto and) slice. I gave it another chance and it was great. I also ordered their vodka slice, which was very good as well. Seeing that their vodka sauce was delicious, I also ordered chicken parm in vodka sauce. It was so cheesy as it should be. I got a side of their burnt broccoli, because I love roasted broccoli. This one is delicious with big chunks crispy, toasted garlic. I also got their chicken Caesar salad slice, because if I'm getting a salad it has to be on pizza. Everything was tasty and the service was quick and efficient. Overall, I would definitely go there if you're on the Upper East Side."

The pesto bow ties are also well done, wouldn't recommend the Sicilian slice, it's perfectly fine but other places have a better Sicilian."

See the pictures below on how our order was delivered. Completely unacceptable! I tried contacting the store. I have not heard back from anyone. Very disappointing.
2186,rGmGim1ZDCxnF8n4NiKrYQ,6/30/2022,3 star rating,"I've been to marinara many times and overall it's just extremely hot or miss. When you order delivery or do pickup there is a 50% chance they will mess up your order, I've learned to check I have everything I ordered before I leave. The prices are also pretty high for what you are getting overall. The one thing they do have and is the reason they are successful in my opinion is their creative and unique items, like salad pizza or vodka chicken parm with pink sauce. Sometimes you just crave one of these unique items and marinara meets the need and that's what I would recommend it for."

Patrons are decent.Ive been to cubby a handful of times and each time my experience has gone from cool to so so to just not great.My biggest issue is the bartenders and it looks like im not alone bc this seems to span back nearly a decade. The bartenders here are not friendly and are borderline rude and standoffish. As a lesbian bar, call it what u will, i don't understand serving and paying more attention to any men that may walk in but my past two visits it seems like unless your a man or white the bartenders arent really interested in serving you.I dont want to call racism, though yes I got that vibe, nothing blatant happened to me personally for me to fly that flag. But the undertones were there for sure and i would just about believe any claims of it.I dont need to go to cubby, its just an ok bar imo and its lack of diversity are personal turn offs, but if i went once a year only that would be enough."

It was very clean and as you can see from the pictures you can see your food being prepared. I ordered a Portobello Brie wrap and a Mochacchino. My husband ordered an everything bagel with cream cheese and onions. First let me say that it took a very long time for our food to come out. It seemed everyone after us and before us got their food and we just took an extra long time for some reason. The Mochacchino was absolutely wonderful. The wrap was a little flat. The cheese wasn't melted which with the cheese being Brie you'd expect it to be. The bagel was relatively small with little to no cream cheese. Bottom line: I think we might go back. They seem to have an amazing sandwich menu. But I did say ""might"". Oh and they had no wifi. Just saying."

Well that was a mistake- I attempted to order a 3p Tender Basket (x2) but it was not available. There was NO boneless chicken available at all- no tenders no popcorn no breast. That eliminates over half the items on the menu. Since I do not eat bone-in chicken I was left without a meal while the other members of my party ate dinner. It's a Sunday evening at 6:00p it seems extremely unreasonable to no offer a large portion of the menu.

Also no honey mustard, I didn't check the chicken, but whatever I was annoyed!!! So after a 15 to 20 min ride home we took the ride back with the  food. I take the food back to tell the young lady Lisa, who stated she is the manager, mind you the other lady with the glasses was wearing the managers tag, basically  no one cares! I complained 1.

2232,N4Pss0mR4ygDOoSRpM2FQA,9/25/2022,2 star rating,This place has a ton of positive reviews.  I'm trying to figure out why because last night I got swindles out of $450.  First up the place needs to put their foot down on the clientele.  Someone wearing a hoodie or sneakers - not acceptable and it diminishes the atmosphere they are trying to keep.  That's just me.  The staff was very attentive but the head waiter was eager to move us along.  I know we aren't the only ones to feel that way as the couple that as just seated was asked if they are ready to order.  The appetizers and the sides were good but seriously overpriced.  The porter house for 2 was a HUGE disappointment.  Really bland and somewhat chewy.  So I'm not sure again why the reviews are so amazing.  It seemed to me that Tuscany is trying to be something it's not.  I'd look elsewhere.

Most traditional steakhouses have a certain vibe to them. This one falls into that category so not much to speak on in regards to aesthetics. What stands out is the service of the team that flows and is well organized. What is exceptional is the food. We stared with a seafood platter and chose the porterhouse steak to share. The seafood platter was fresh and generous. The steak was like butter and perfectly cooked. Then with the recommendation of one of our servers, we chose the pecan pie for dessert. I'm not a fan of pecan pies but this was one of the best desserts I ever had after dinner. Thanks to the staff and we hope to put this restaurant into rotation."

2240,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,10/12/2021,3 star rating,"As a Spaniard I had really high hopes for this restaurant. I understand, of course, that it might be hard for Spanish restaurants to get their hands on authentic ingredients, even here in NYC, so I have factored that into my rating. Also, if Yelp allowed half stars I wouldn't hesitate in giving it a 3.5. I suppose that it is also possible that if we had tried different things that the rating might be higher. On this occasion we tried the olives, the grilled sardines, the boquerones, the croquetas and the pan con tomate.The olives were fine, although my wife thought they had too much vinegar. The real problem with the olives is that you pay $6.75 for maybe a dozen olives. I understand we're in Manhattan and that things get pricy here, but that price is a little steep, especially for a small, unassuming, quaint, family owned place like this. The grilled sardines were really good. They were cooked just like back in Spain. I only regret not ordering more of them (you get two per serving). The boquerones had some sort of weird, off-taste that I have never tasted before on boquerones. I've had boquerones all over Spain and we make them at home. They have always been marinated in olive oil with sliced garlic (sometimes onion also), and parsley. These were served with a sliced tomato for garnish together with lots of sliced onion. I'm not suggesting that there is only one way to prepare boquerones, but from Asturias to Alicante and Valencia to Cáceres, I have only ever tasted them the one way. If their method had tasted as good, even if it were different, I would be fine with it. But these just tasted off. I would not recommend them to anyone, particularly not anyone familiar with the way we've always experienced them everywhere else. The chicken croquetas were disappointing because they didn't seem, or taste, home-made at all. I have a very strong suspicion that they were pre-made frozen Goya brand or something similar to that. Either way, not authentic in the least. The pan con tomate, on the other hand, was also very good. Like I said, we only tried a small portion of what they offer. I would definitely come back to try other things and have more to base this on, I really want to love this place, but for now, these are my impressions.The locale itself is great. The staff was very friendly and accommodating and the place itself has a very authentic feel to it. The bar was pretty quiet when we were there, but it seemed like a great place to watch Spain play in the World Cup or something. It's been around, family owned, since 1974 so I guess they must be doing something right.The bottom line: This is a very authentic feeling, quaint, family owned restaurant. The limited food we sampled was ok but not very high on the authenticity scale. I'm not saying you shouldn't give this place a try, but you might want to manage your expectations if you have had authentic Spanish food."

I found the pulpo to be on the salty side. The tortilla española was a hit as was the chorizo. The gambas al ajillo needed more garlic. I ordered the Lamb as an entree and although it was decent the morsels were particularly small with more bone than anything else. We ordered two pitchers of Sangria and our bill was $200. Will I ever come back? Yes. But to eat not drink.
2242,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,10/16/2021,5 star rating,"I went there because of Sarah Jessica Parker's recommendation. I had the chicken Riazor and it was so good! Very flavorful, juicy, and tender. Also big portion for the more than reasonable price. The space is a bit small but they went beyond the standard in making sure COVID precautionary measures were in place. I also asked the owner if he saw SJP when she visited, he said yes and many people followed her recommendation -- I also coincidentally ordered the same dish as SJP! What a lovely coincidence as well!"
2243,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,9/18/2021,5 star rating,A hidden neighborhood gem!! This place is absolutely delicious staff is amazing and food and sangria are ridiculously delicious one of my favorite restaurants when I go back home.

The aroz con pollo was legit amazing. I also had half of a pot left over to bring home. Even the outside seating area was so cute. I appreciated the plastic dividers between each table. Super satisfied customer ! Will be returning to this restaurant!"
2245,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,8/16/2020,5 star rating,They have the best paella and sangria in chelsea maybe Manhattan!  The outdoor space is very charming and the folks are so friendly.  Highly recommended.
2246,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,3/21/2021,5 star rating,Delicious tapas and great prices.   Highly recommend the clams in wine sauce.  A great fine off the beaten path a block!  Quiet spot and service was great too.
2247,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,3/8/2018,4 star rating,"Adam Platt just argued that New York's 'neighborhood' restaurants have a monotony problem - and I couldn't agree more.  The solution?  Cafe Riazor.  Take a seat at the bar, turn your back to the door (and the view of the street), and you could be anywhere, any time.  The stucco ceiling and strings of red lights, the sounds of ""Sweet Caroline"" in Spanish, and the simple, sturdy food are more transporting than any number of hipster haunts, however hard they try.The ham croquettes were crunchy and creamy, the squid with garlic was tender enough, gritty with paprika, the oil pooling in the dish begging to be sopped up with decidedly NON-artisanal bread.  Have a few glasses of the house Rioja.  Trot out your high school Spanish and chat with the five guys who stopped in for a post-work drink and greeted the world-weary bartender like she was their long lost Aunt.  Finish with flan, not nearly as dense and eggy as it should be, but comforting in its sweet, slippery-ness.  A small glass of Fernet so you can face the street again.  Next week, Bamonte's!  It's up to us to keep these real places alive."
2248,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,1/12/2020,1 star rating,"My wife and I had been dying to try this place for a while. The decor inside was intimate and very casual, somewhat reminiscent of what we experienced in Spain. The food was bland and the portions were TINY. We had the garlic shrimp was ""ok"" the patatas bravas were basically some fried potatoes and some tomato paste, no seasoning no alioli. Pan con tomate was an piece of bread with sliced tomato, not the traditional puréed tomato and toasted bread. Chorizo was the only thing that was good. We left hungry and it's safe to say we're never coming back again. For what we spent? Folks, spend your money elsewhere."
2249,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,10/1/2018,2 star rating,We've ordered thru Grubhub numerous times and we really like the food but lately there is a problem. The delivery process is terrible. We waited over 2 hours last week for food and never got it. The time before that the food came 45 mins late and the driver insisted on a tip. I don't know if he didn't understand the Grubhub tip process or if he was playing games. Either way I'm not tipping you twice! Great food but pick it up.Delivery here is a joke at best!
2250,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,7/28/2018,1 star rating,"Came here once before for lunch. This was my first time and I decided to give it a try. Ordered a croissant with egg and cheese and it was very bland. They just added salt and pepper. No taste what so ever. My expectations was high because of the price that I was paying.Came here a second time because I wanted to give them another try. the lady that took my order was extremely rude. She spoke with the lowest voice ever and when asked to repeat, she would get angry at you and look at you as if you didn't speak English. Again, I was expecting something more when compared to what I paid for. Spent around 10 ish for a ""Cesar Salad"" that had too much dressing and no protein. I could not finish it because it was that bad. Do not come here if you are looking for something savory and cheap because it is the opposite here."

2252,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,11/1/2018,4 star rating,"Awesome place, especially for BC students. I love the veggie burrito, salads, and smoothies. Lot of vegetarian options. Super cute inside, pretty fast service and workers are pleasant. Can get crowded during lunch. Definitely recommend it."
2253,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,10/18/2018,4 star rating,Ordered thru Uber Eats. Order arrived on time.  Food was okay however there were a couple of disappointments. My chicken order was missing a side of sweet corn. And the rice in the dish although looks tasty was hard and crunchy. How did it even get that way ?? The meal needed a little salt... But overall would try them again.
2254,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,10/24/2017,3 star rating,"Good food at an affordable price!I'm a student at Brooklyn College so forgetting to pack my meals isn't a huge deal with this place around.  For Breakfast they provide egg sandwiches + egg platters that are pretty much customizable.Lunch/Dinner they've got... - various sandwich options- platter options like chicken breast/roast chicken, beef, pork etc... with an array of sides for a balanced meal.They also have Smoothies + JuicesI have yet to try these but I'm glad I have that option.My only knock on them would be that they tend to lose track of your food.  I've been there on multiple occasions and have had stuff missing from my order (that I've had to pay for).  I do tip every time I go, so it'd be nice if they got the order right.Other than that, customer service is awesome.  All the employees are helpful + friendly."

2256,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,4/3/2017,4 star rating,"If you're a Brooklyn College student, you don't have many options, & this place gets a 3.5 overall & based off the options in this neighborhood, I would give it a 4. There are many affordable options: chicken  soup here is scrumptious & pretty consistent. I love slow cooked chicken with the bones present-- my mama is from the 3rd world, so this is definitely in my palette. They also have juices & they're also affordable. $4-$6 and for a juice, that's not bad. They make 'em fresh & have ginger, kale, oranges, apples & they even have a green known as MORINGA which is loaded with nutrients & difficult to find in the states. Salads are ehhh for me. They have everything you need, but they just don't do it for me. Burritos I love. I mean, they're not California burritos  but... they're big, you get to choose, & they aren't shy about making it a big one for you. Plantains are great & sandwiches here are decent. Nothing special, but okay. I'm a loyal customer, though this isn't the fanciest place to eat because they're affordable, the customer service is great & they are quick with it. I would stay hungry if not for Ovi's. Love,Renee in BK"
2257,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,8/15/2019,1 star rating,"Going to get straight to the point....Over priced, no variety, food really isn't that great, customer service leaves a lot to be desired. They are convenient for Brooklyn college and midwood students and so they get a lot of business because of it, otherwise I'm not impressed at all with this place."
2258,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,7/6/2017,3 star rating,"I placed an order at 10:27 on Seamless. It was supposed to be here 11:27-11:37 according to the website and text I received. I tried to call when it was late but it just rang and went to a fax machine noise. The food finally came at 12:05. I know exactly where this place is because I've ordered in person both to go and to stay. It is VERY close to where I live. I ordered just coffee & sides which are usually sitting in warmers ready to scoop out and serve. It should not have taken over an hour & a half for my food to arrive. I am aware that when regular classes are in session at Brooklyn College it is crazy here & there will be a line out the door with all the seats taken during lunch hours, but it's summer and it was early when I ordered.There was no gravy on my mashed potatoes. There is no option to add it so I assume that you have to write it in as a comment in order to get it. On Seamless, they do not include the cookies they sell which is upsetting because those are good. The sweet plantains weren't very ripe when they were cooked so they were very firm and dry. The mac & cheese was good. The mashed potatoes were a little watery, but still good. The cornmeal and beans were stiff since I don't think it sells very well but it was ok. The coffee was impressively wrapped so there were zero spills which was nice. They sent me a couple of 1 ounce cups containing what seems to be an interesting homemade hot sauce. The reason I'm not quite sure is because it has little bits of garlic, corn & green peas floating in it. I tried some. It kinda tasted like Tabasco.One of the times I went in with someone to order, we got the cod fish. The guy didn't tell us we'd have to wait a good 15mins for it & that it happened to be the whole fish with bones & skin included. We waited patiently and ate it anyway. It was good, but it would have been nice to know in advance since it much more tedious to eat. I'd recommend going here in person rather than ordering if you're really hungry since the Flatbush area is sadly lacking in anything remotely healthy (if you thought Chinese take-out places were unhealthy, try going to Peking on Flatbush & you'll see how much more grease you can get with your noodles for free!), but avoid this place if you can because they are overpriced for the quality you're getting and most of the meat is fried.For those of you who go there for the smoothies and juices, juice isn't that good for you anyway & you can get your smoothies from the new bubble tea spot nearby called Jupioca that opened on Hillel Place with less hassle and just as many options (unless of course you're like me and you go there with the intention of being healthy & then find that you can't fight the urge to order bubble tea instead lol)."

I got a shrimp quesadilla my boyfriend got the shrimp fajita and we also got a order of guacamole and chips. What a please tell surprise! Everything was great! Made fresh the food came out piping hot. It was flavorful, and filling. They haven't gotten their liquor license as of yet which they tell you before you sit just in case you were looking to have drinks. I thought that was great. Or the bill was about $45 with the two meals and appetizer. Like I said before they were very attentive making sure we had everything we needed. I plan to go back and try a few more things like the tacos and tostadas. Definitely, a place I would bring family and friends. It is a must try!"
2261,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,8/18/2020,4 star rating,This spot is one of the best Mexican restaurants that offers adequate space for dining. The food is delicious and the service is delightful. They have one of the friendliest and customer-oriented staff on Staten Island. They have gone above and beyond for me more than once. Not to mention that their prices on drinks are amazing! I would recommend to stop by and grab a meal with friends and family. You will not be disappointed!
2262,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,8/29/2021,5 star rating,Great authentic Mexican restaurant. Best soft tacos I've had since buying street tacos in Los Angeles. The onion habanero relish and a tomatillo sauce are exquisite. Definitely worth a trip.
2263,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,3/2/2020,4 star rating,"Fresh authentic Mexican food, you can definitely taste the quality & authenticity in the food. Service when we went was great, I was disappointed that they didn't have any alcohol, I could have went for a margarita. We order from here all the time, on the weekends it isn't a problem, and we get our food right away, on a weekday, I wouldn't do it again, over a hour, and food came cold. But...since the food has always been so good, that isn't going to reflect on my rating. I must say I really enjoy the shrimp tacos, steak quesadilla, and LOVE the fresh guacamole."
2264,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,4/9/2020,4 star rating,I love the food here but sometimes when I order shrimp/fish items - they're not too fresh tasting. The food is always delivered on time and it comes packaged well. They now deliver Sangria and Margaritas too!!!
2265,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,9/11/2020,3 star rating,I enjoy the food and drinks but I wish they would bring back the red sangria and the different margarita options in Seamless. The delivery menu  has changed when it comes to drink options and they're losing possible business (at least mine) when considering places.
2266,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,5/26/2019,5 star rating,This is a fantastic neighborhood restaurant! The food is delicious and authentic! Everything cooked to perfection.

2269,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,7/13/2017,4 star rating,A solid bar where everyone seems to know each other and it's not so dark that you can't see each other and not so loud that you can't hear each other. Basically how you want your neighborhood bar.

I never say no when someone asks me to join then at the Rover. The place is small inside, has a dart board and few televisions along with a projector screen that usually shows the hot sporting event for the night. I come here for the atmosphere and the Bartenders really are the best. I can't remember their names but I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. It's a local bar and the drinks are cheap. One bartender in particular always stands out. He's tall and slim. That's all I can remember but he's an awesome guy."

2278,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,3/26/2015,4 star rating,"I'm not a regular here by any means but I hit it a few times a year. It's a good Irish bar that's no frills and makes no apologies. The bartenders, once you get to know them a bit, are friendly and always have some good conversation there. Drinks are basic and good and reasonably priced. They'll buy you back too which is nice since that seems to be an unheard of practice in Manhattan.  They play lots of sports here that you may not get in other bars like soccer, rugby, and hurling. If you like this stuff you will like this bar. I've never seen any trouble in there and the crowd is pretty even keel. This is not by any means a scene of ""the beautiful people"" you may find in other bars however you are not there for that and you certainly aren't paying for it. Come in, sit down, have a few drinks and shake your tough day off here."

I am a small business and I work for a few..If your business is slow/not thriving at the moment. I'd expect more attention to detail... I also came to your establishment after my private chef gig and didn't see my order until I got home after a long day of work. Trusting it would be great.

I love dumplings and I order them every time I have Asian food, but these are to die for. I got a combo of 3 chicken and 3 pork dumplings and it came with their secret sauce. I also got a side of a spicy chili oil but I didn't even need it! The secret sauce is so good on its own. I will be ordering chicken dumplings next time, I preferred those iced the pork ones. I wish I had ordered more because I craved them for the next two days. I can't wait to go back in and get more dumplings. A must. Don't walk, run."

I must've come in between meal times, since there weren't any other customers.There was a menu posted up on the wall, but the cashier directed me to a printed out menu that was posted next to the register. I guess they had a limited or different menu due to covid? I ended up ordering a scallion pancake and some kind of fried veggie dumplings to go.The scallion pancake was good: crispy, flaky, and hot. The dumplings were okay, I didn't find them particularly special or unique. The soy sauce that came with my meal was also just fine, but I feel like it lost some of its taste with the more oily food I dipped in..  I ended up mixing my own soy sauce with Sriracha and preferred that.Overall, I liked the food and it lasted me about 2.5 meals. It was pretty satisfying and heated up well as leftovers. For the price, flavors, and distance from my apartment, I don't think I would go out of my way to come back, but I would recommend trying it."

It's definitely got a clean and fresh aesthetic that caters to the Instagram and Tik Tok vibes, and the food itself wasn't bad. The dumplings were flavorful, and they came out on time. However, it was hard to justify spending over $30 on dumplings when we had just come from Chinatown and got them for less than $10. The ones in Chinatown were also larger, juicier, and had a bit more variety in terms of presentation and types. I couldn't stand the Dan Dan Noodles. They were an odd texture and flavor. They reminded me of spaghetti in terms of both taste and texture. I was also hoping that it would have had pork or a more traditional sauce. This one was vegan (?), and the sauce was oddly creamy."

I like the 50/50 option that they have where you can choose between two types of dumplings. We decided to try Mimi Cheng's dumplings and the pork and chive dumplings, pan fried. The price of 8 dumplings were over $15, which is pretty pricey but I don't mind paying for good food, especially in these hard times of the pandemic. But, unfortunately, maybe my expectations were too high or perhaps they were having an off day; these dumplings were extremely salty. They were, however, very flavorful. The staff was very nice and the store is nice and bright with a clean ambiance. Would I go back again? Unfortunately, with all the other options that are within walking or a short driving distance, I can't say for sure that I would."

I was a little disappointed they weren't doing their 50/50 and only had one veggie dumpling available.   The veggie dumpling is delicious though.   The greens are just ok (felt a bit greasy) and the cucumber salad, while fresh, lacked flavor.  I don't think the sides here are great, but the veggie dumplings are nice."

I live for their monthly collabs, and get excited when they bring back their fan favorites (emmy's burger dumplings!). Their sauce is great, although pretty standard for dumplings. It's definitely a bit more expensive than your average frozen dumplings, but you're paying for fresh ingredients and quality. I hope they start offering shipping options for their dumplings!"

2295,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,5/4/2021,1 star rating,The service in this IHOP is absolutely ridiculous! It took them 30 minutes to take our name for a table. Then made us wait 20 minutes more in an empty dining room.  We had to leave the place because we sat there for another 20 minutes and not one waiter took our order! This IHOP location needs to check up on the employee's destroying there business.

I've heard about the ridiculous wait times, but it's almost inevitable given how lackluster Staten Island is in the restaurant scene and how many visitors this place gets on a normal basis.  For this reason, I think this IHOP does its job.During our latest visit, wait times weren't unbearable due to snowy conditions outdoors.  Our waitress was also wonderfully friendly and patient with our big party of orders and requests.  I ordered myself a Make Your Own Combo breakfast that came with my choice of 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, hash brown and bacon.  Although the pancakes were a little dry, the rest of the combo meal was pretty satisfying.  Expectations were kept low since this is a chain after all, but I was pretty pleased for that reason."

I was never attended to aside from the initial taking of my order. To receive my food, I asked another server to grab our food, which was cold. I had to walk to the hostess and ask to pay myself because the waitress never returned to my table. Unimpressed with the general negligence of the server and lack of attention provided at this IHOP. I would recommend encouraging the staff to provide the extra care when correcting mistakes. By continuing to neglect your duties, you only further disgust the customers."

It's just intimidating for me - someone with low self-esteem (wahhh) - to show my friggen face there.I ought to do it more.During my most recent visit, I had every intention to write a Yelp review because I had been putting it off for so long. I decided to treat myself: a slice with Italian sausages, a slice with pepperoni, $2 worth of garlic knots, and a can of DIET coke. I'm a binge-eater so don't judge. Their garlic knots are one of the best garlic knots I have ever tried... but the more I come (that's what she said), the more it's becoming hit or... less than a hit. Not completely a miss. Well, maybe, occasionally. Occasionally, they could sit in the oven longer than they have to and they would become dry and hard (...), instead of being moist, crunchy, oily, and garlicky. When it's done right, it's the best. I would order $5 worth of them and forget about the pizza. But in my most recent visit, I would rate the garlic knots 3 / 5. Usually, they would be 5 / 5.I can't remember the last time I ate their pizza, but I thought that they were going to be one of the best I ever had. The pizza, surprisingly, was underwhelming. Underwhelming as in I had high expectations. They were chewy. Still good though. 3.5 / 5 this time. Next time, it might be different. I will eat again.The employees seem cool and old-school; veterans in what they do. They seem indubitably respectable. They run a pizzeria that's been around, perhaps, since before I was born.Four out of five stars. They might be a five, so I'll have to return and found out..."

It's just as good and the prices reasonable. $2.25 for the pizza and $1.50/5 garlic knots. * Mushroom pizza was loaded with mushrooms and it was very cheesy. Good amount of sauce and the crust was very crispy. * Garlic knots were very tasty, they use fresh garlic and is best when consumed warm/hot Staffs were friendly and quick, they'll ask if you want other seasonings before boxing your takeout.

During a pandemic you have one of the cook's not wearing gloves. The heavy set man who makes the pizza on two occasions had to be called out for him NOT wearing gloves. He was actively pounding pizza dough, and touches boxes as well as other surfaces. The older gentlemen who is the owner excused him by saying ""oh I'm the one who handles money"". As I told him, still this man is touching things and handling food. I called in my order and he was the one who took it.

This brown sugar milk tea tasted basically tasted like regular milk tea, but with the aftertaste of some brown sugar. It seemed sweeter than milk tea and less boring than regular milk tea.  I can't tell if the boba and brown sugar are pre-made and just purchased by the gallon or someone in the shops actually cooks the boba and heat the sugar to make it. well I'm not glad I tried it out there are other shops nearby that are better"

This Gong Cha is very small, probably only fitting 10 seated people at most and 5 people in line at most. However, that's okay because the employees are efficient in making each drink. I noticed no one was in line, and when I got my order, I probably only waited about a minute before my drink came out! I ended up ordering a large brown sugar milk tea with boba and 70% sweetness. Gong Cha is definitely not skimping out on boba tea, as it came in a huge cup! This is more than adequate for splitting between two people or one very thirsty boba tea connoisseur. The boba was chewy and sweet! The tea itself tasted authentic, despite it coming out so quickly as some powdered drinks do. I would definitely come back here if I am in the area!"

I see Gong Cha as a part of the boba shop group that is somewhat reasonable but doesn't taste cheap. Last time I was here, I tried the milk foam green tea. I should've asked for a semi-circular lid before they sealed the cup, but the drink tasted best when the foam and green tea was mixed together well.

It's rare when a restaurant has so many delicious options that I struggle to choose. The price fix menu offered a great selection from their Reg menu with a few twists. For appetizers we chose the risotto and the roasted acorn squash salad. The risotto was cooked to perfection and had wonderful subtle flavors from the pancetta. The acorn squash salad had a light dressing that was well balanced. The acorn squash was tender and tasteful! My husband and I both opted for the Sweet & Smokey pork chop. The chop was thick cut, tender and done perfectly throughout. It was served atop sweet potatoes and bacon hash, topped with gravy drizzle and and Apple compote and Americanmicro greens. The layers of flavors in this entree are worth talking about for weeks to come! For dessert I had the panna cotta, while my husband had the apple cinnamon bread pudding with a scoop of homemade coffee ice cream. Both desserts were amazing!

They gear to the pre theater crowd and they know people must be out by certain times. In fact they asked: 7 or 8p show? Since we had time, we enjoyed a bit more orderly and leisurely meal. Started with mussels which is a treat you can't get at home. A little spicy but not over the top. Use the fresh bread to soak up the extra broth for sure. Then I got the lamb bolognese. I'm a sucker for fresh pasta and this didn't disappoint. It was rich without being Heavy. And really popped with flavor. The pasta was just so so good. Don't miss the ricotta zeppoli's which are basically mini munchkins but way way better. They came out warm with chocolate and caramel dipping sauces. Oh my. Heavenly.

The guy at the front wasn't the kindest. From the moment I walked in, he seemed uninterested in me. A bit snooty and unprofessional. Perhaps it was because I was a black woman. I was inquiring with him about how busy the place was on a certain night because I was having a celebration after seeing a show and was bringing about 10 people. He kept reiterating Sunday evening the place was going to booked up. He then told me that the evening I was questioning had some rsvp's and ""what else do want me to say?"". He wasn't very personable, to say the least. Put a very bad taste in my mouth. I wound up having a few bites there to get more of a feel of the place & because I had a gift card I wanted to use. I sat at the bar and the two women that waited on me were nice. They brightened the experience for me. The food was better than ok, but not amazing. The risotto balls were lacking flavor but the crab cake and the warm apple cider dink I got were pretty good. When I was leaving, there were two white women that walked out before me, he made sure to thank them and tell them to ""have a good night"" but said absolutely nothing to me and I was 10 steps behind them. He actually turned away to not even gaze in my direction. The only reason I'll go back to this place is so I can spend the rest of my gift card. This guy needs an attitude adjustment."

It was good but not great, as it was lacking a lot of flavor overall. For the price I was also hoping for a slightly larger portion of chowder underneath as well. They also provide bread and butter as part of the table service. Would try again as other dishes around us did seem larger. My wife got the vegetable paella, which was good but not does not replace paella."

I opted for the prefix menu as it looked like a good deal. To start I got the crab cake which had a upcharge but was worth it. the crab cake was good but I really enjoyed the side cucumber and seaweed salad that came with it as well. For dinner I got the Atlantic salmon with roast corn and cous cou, the salmon was good flaky and not fish and had a nice grilled flavor. The corn and cous cous was really yummy and I wish it had come with more! For dessert I opted for the warm chocolate cake which was pretty average. our server was really nice I was with people I hadn't seen in a while and were catching up so took us a long time to pick what we wanted but he was patient and didn't make us fee rushed. I also had a couple cosmos which were good not to sweet."

There are plenty of televisions to watch the big sporting events or challenge your buddy to a game of pool!Great place to bring a large group of friends and socialize; this is a popular choice for NYU students.

We ended up sitting at a table - more like a table with some benches. This was a great atmosphere for hanging out. We got some pitchers of beer to start and then moved to drinks after - all of which was standard. There are also fun dart boards that are in half barrels, which we eventually played a few rounds on."

Can't say much about prices as one of the guys in our group just kept buying those massive bud light towers for us all - I was not opposed to it. We hung out in the side area that's a little separated. I was glad they had darts but it wasn't the best space for them considering how the nearby tables are set up. I'd be happy to stop in for a drink if I'm in the area again."
2358,RQojRzAYA9Cq87PqwQq5yg,3/23/2018,4 star rating,"Looking for a great West Village sports bar? Then Triona's is the right place. The beer selection is excellent, the happy hour goes late (until 8pm I think), and the service is consistently friendly. The TV's are massive and in HD, so it's an ideal bar for watching sports. The place can fill up a quick during the NBA finals or March Madness, so come prepared for standing room. And while they don't serve food, it's still BYOGrub, so that's a plus. All and all, an excellent West Village institution."

The cheap feel of the tables and lighting upstairs make you want to leave ASAP. What really ticked me off was (after double, triple-checking my bill) being overcharged by a few dollars.

Wanted to try something new and got the combo and chose beef curry along with eggplant and potatoes and some cauliflower and potatoes. The veggie dishes were good. The beef was tender, but the curry was a little bland. The rice was cooked well but could have used some spices. The naan was fantastic.I also got some treats. A gulab jamun and another dessert that reminded me of a peanut butter bar. Both were pretty good.I'll be back to try some other dishes. I had no idea they had been around since 1994."

We were still a little hungry so we decided to pull up to the bar, share some apps and drinks and order some take-away to bring to our respective homes.I haven't been to a Spice in a long time. I've visited many locations but my favourite was always the Chelsea location. I seldom went to any other for fear that I would not enjoy my meal the same. I'm glad we found this location.The bartender was very sweet and patient with us while we took our time trying to figure out what we wanted to eat there and what we each would be ordering to go. We shared a hot tea pot, some calimari and dumplings. It was all good.I ordered their duck ramen which was more of a duck udon noodle soup but still very flavourful with a broth, full of depth. They packaged the broth separately so as to maintain the duck's crispy skin with its fat, rendered, just how I like it. I also ordered some chicken pineapple fried rice for hubby as well as some rolls and dumplings for us to share at home.The prices are still very reasonable and their food is still just as good as I remember it being. I'll have to place Spice back on my restaurant rotation. Amsterdam might just be the new fave which kind of works since it's a heck of a lot closer to my home than lower Manhattan."

And then halfway through waiting, she comes over and tells us she can't make any drinks and she's sorry and hurried away:/ got the feeling she had known when taking our order, but wanted us to place our food order. She told us she couldn't make any drinks, like that's okay but tell us from the start before we place a food order:/ probably won't be back"
2371,wO9FMvtYqsJoYrnHDASE0A,6/5/2021,4 star rating,"Went for drinks and dinner around 8 on a Friday. Luckily the rainy weather kept people away so we got a table without waiting. The staff are friendly and got us set up at a cute table on their patio, which has this cute canopy of fake flowers. They have pretty reasonable prices on interesting drinks like passion fruit caipirinha and lycheetini. Those were good! We ordered crab Rangoon and I was surprised when it came with a side of spicy Mayo / special sauce of some kind. The texture was very meaty, and I wasn't a fan. I ordered kao soi which was fine but the plating made me crazy. There was this tiny bowl with the curry and vegetables and then noodles on the side. So I had to selectively take stuff out of the bowl or just eat really fast so I could get some noodles in there while it was warm. Apart from being bizarrely sweet it was fine. The thing that I'd order again was actually my friends food- he got some amazing drunk noodles. They were so soft and fresh it was the best drunk noodles I've had in NY so far."
2372,wO9FMvtYqsJoYrnHDASE0A,4/9/2022,2 star rating,"Food is often solid here, but they're very sloppy about getting delivery order details right.  Example: tonight, we ordered Volcanic Chicken.  It's grilled chicken with stir-fried veggies and sauce.  We ordered with light/mild spice.  It came very spicy, so I called to have them re-do it.  It took 5 minutes on hold to get through, and then they insisted that they did in fact make it light on spice.  (It's not the first time we've had the dish.)So, they did send it again.  It was very mild.  But, they skipped the vegetables, so now I was stuck with dry chicken and nothing else.  Spice is a dish best... not served.  I'd rather cook."

I cant believe it took me this long to discover it, but now that I did I will probably eat here every day. They have a $10 lunch special that cannot be beat! A lot of great options and it even includes an appetizer. I had the crispy spring rolls and the pad thai fried rice and they were both great. The latter had both chicken and shrimp and was a pretty good portion for the price. My coworkers had a few different plates and they all loved their food as well. Outside of the lunch special, everything seems to be priced decently. The happy hour is the other selling point. They have cocktails for $5-$7 and $4 beer and wine. The Thai Breeze cocktail is soooo good I almost had 3. The best part is that the happy hour takes place every single day.The space itself is very pretty and I loved the decor. They have seating both outside and inside. Staff was great, very fast and friendly! I'm def. going to become a regular moving forward!"

Unfortunately, today that all went into a screeching halt and this my friends...saddens me. I ordered the aged pork chops and this dish has always been two really nice pieces of chop with the bone and juicy fat on the edges. The order comes with jasmine rice that you could smell across the room and makes you savor it the more you smell it. Today, the pork chops looked like the cheapest cut you can get at your local market as it was missing the bone. You used to get two pieces and today all I received was one and it was cut in half. It was extremely dry to the point where I thought they had accidentally cooked a piece of carpet. The jasmine rice wasn't even jasmine rice but instead uncle Ben's rice. I understand the pandemic hit restaurants hard but cutting corners like this while still charging the same isn't going to get me to come back. Ugh so sad to see this place in this state."

It was actually quite cozy, but I think that might have been more our mood than the establishment itself, which is free of all decoration and kind of cold (not physically). It is new, so maybe they will still improve on that :)"

TWICE... and the third time I came in he had it ready for me when it was my turn to order. So I guess it's love? Or close to it. Because if that's not love, I'm really not sure what is.There is usually a line at all times but I would say that they're pretty efficient. I haven't ordered anything more extravagant than my coffee (medium hazlenut, dark with half and half if you must know) and a toasted multi grain bagel, but I have seen people order those fancy pants new sandwiches and it looked like it took a while. I am completely confused by this. Donuts, bagels, coffee, and even breakfast sandwiches with that abnormal looking egg patty I understand. What is this hash browns nonsense? And the flatbreads that look far better in their ads? People, stick to what's in the name.

Because of the shop being small, you are herded out quickly, and by the time you sample your beverage for accuracy, they are ass-deep in other customers. They quickly toss out the receipt before you can ask, and make a big deal out of fetching it for you (doing the survey posted on it gets you a free donut with any medium beverage purchase). Which, relating to another poster's comments, yeah, the donut choices are not always big, as many display trays are empty in the mornings.

The Shrimp Tempura looked incredibly mass-produced, but were very crunchy, steaming hot, and I loved them. The fried dumplings were dry and somewhat boring. The dumpling sauce they serve for them made me laugh, as they're served in a small plastic sauce container, but while one of them were filled with the sauce about 50% full, the other container was filled less than 25% of the way. What am I gonna do with a little bit of sauce like that?  The guy at the counter gave me a couple of extra sauce cups.  The spring rolls, like the Shrimp Tempura, has a really nice crunch. Other than that, I found it to be dull.All in all, I would not rush back. When I eat Japanese, I like a real ""restaurant"" experience. To me, to eat Japanese is a cultural experience... it's not like eating a slice of pizza to me. Furthermore, having owned a restaurant myself, my opinion is that even a ""fast food"" Japanese food establishment like this one can do quite a bit better.  Remember Chipotle in their first few years of existence?  They were incredible, yet they were considered to be fast food. That's what I'm talking about.  Sarku is not of that caliber.  They serve their duck sauce in single serve packets, for example.Still, if you're looking for some cheap Japanese, and you're not hung up on a cultural experience as I am, you might want to check this place out."

The food overall is just good & I wish they can open more restaurant locations all over. I also like that the price was reasonable for the amount of food you get. This was my first time at a store because usually I go to the one at the mall but the store is much more presentable. Also the mall don't have any of the option the store has.

I figured I would give it a try since I was pregnant and craved something different and this would be my first time trying out Japanese American food. I was quite satisfied with the taste of my food. I had the chicken teriyaki which comes with a side of steamed vegetables and your choice of white rice, fried rice, brown rice or lo mein. I had fried rice but should have gotten white because it was just too greasy. Overall the food was good with a nice teriyaki flavor that was not too over bearing. I usually visit when I am in the neighborhood."

It was only an additional $1 for extra chicken, which is a pretty good deal for the amount you get. They give you extra sauce on the side without asking, which is a plus. You could also swap the white rice for fried rice, noodles, or brown rice for only a slight additional cost - which I feel isn't too bad for the personalization that it allows. All in all, a satisfying meal for less than (or around) $10. Place was also spacious and clean."

Of course the sushi isn't really great, I'd be weary about Eating the raw maki rolls from them but other than that this place is really good. They make standard teriyaki chicken at a good price. I like that get include a cup of extra teriyaki sauce with your food. I got the bento box and also received salad dressing and spicy mayo free of charge. Wait was pretty long for how empty it was at the time so I suggest you call ahead if you go in the middle of the day. They food was good, I'll be back. Btw they have a special going on until February. Bento boxes are a dollar cheaper and so is the chicken teriyaki."

Usually located in shopping malls, Sarku has a nice selection of Japanese food including sushi. I have yet to try to sushi or California rolls but intend too very soon. So far have only tried their chicken teriyaki bowl which was very good. The one thing that I feel Sarku can use to improve somewhat is an additional register or two to improve line service because it tends to get fairly crowded here during peak lunch hours and also early dinner hours. But you do have the option to call to pre-order to pick up your food but if you are going here off a whim be prepared to stand on line for quite a few minutes as at times the waiters behind the register are taking orders on line as well as on the phone at times."

The nopal was soggy and too acidic, and the avocado taco had beans that weren't flavored. Definitely better tacos in Brooklyn, but I did hear the brunch is better"

Everything feels very rustic in the best way, and the dark yet cozy ambiance adds the perfect amount of intimacy to any sort of hangout. To start, I got the guacamole with their handmade tortilla chips, which interestingly enough come in round plate shaped sizes. You are only give 5 or 6, so I recommend breaking the round large chip into smaller pieces to help place yourself out. The guac was flavorful, and didn't need to add a thing. Definitely a 10/10.The next thing I got was 3 tacos, the chicken tinga, it was an unexpectedly sweet flavor because of the mix between the chicken and pineapple, but still very tasty. Would rate 7/10. The next up was the bistec taco, which was out of this world!!! Absolutely would recommend if you are a fan of taco and well seasoned steak, definitely a 10/10. The last one was the carne enchilada which was amazing in taste, my only qualm being that the pork was slightly more fatty than I would have liked. But other than that I loved 9/10.My drink of the night was the red sangria on draft. If you like red wine or sangria, then this is a must try! Overall I will always recommend Chavela, it's a Brooklyn gem :)"

Their margaritas are obviously perfect but their other cocktails are stars in their own right, too. My favorite is the Hija de tu Madre but you can't really go wrong with any option. A few other ""every time I come here"" staples are the queso fundido and the guac (though I have yet to try the smoked trout version).

Now I like these kind of places, but I just don't feel comfortable here. Hard to place my thumb on it. Is it the lighting? Music? Don't know????Like I said, it is a destination place for me to play poker. Bartenders are nice. Pricing is average for the area. They give buybacks. I notice that any food ordered seems to come through a doorway in the middle of the room from the restaurant next door. Seems like same owners. No biggie. Food appeared to be tasty. Never had a meal here, just drinks.Overall, if your here to play poker you will have a very good time. I guess if you're here  with a group, you could make it happen, but solo?????

The bar itself was nice I liked the decor and the owner was nice I believe he was who greeted me.  I am a bartender so I'm aware of how it should be prepared I've been working in service since I was 14 from bus boy to bartender, I don't mean to be annoying here with this review just a heads up of what to possibly work on.

Courtesy counts for a lot at an establishment.  We're back at 2 stars, because Brian and Jess know they're stars in my eyes ;) without this review, and the more I think about how the owner has treated his clientele, the more it hits me I am probably never going back, despite the tastiest chicken fingers I've had to date, and I'm not usually into chicken fingers.-----Pseudo-update 1/25/2013 for all you trivia fans:Let's Get Quizzical has been revived, as promised at a new location: Maggie Mae's in Sunnyside.  It re-debuts 8:30 p.m. Thursday, February 7!"

2441,LfPtY7hYpOsNTaxgfny_hw,1/11/2010,3 star rating,"I was helping out a friend in the area and realized I needed some grub after a few hours, so during a break I walked down to 86 street under the elevated train tracks to see what I could find.  I lived in this area in the 80's when it was still mostly Italian.  Now Chinese businesses have insinuated themselves into the area, and one of them is the bakery/restaurant Yu King Bakery.Yu King is a fairly standard looking bakery.  Walk in and to the left is the counter with various baked goods in a glass display.  To the right are a few tables with seats, I can't imagine more than twelve people sitting comfortably inside however.  Behind the cash register are racks of dry and steam heaters that keep various buns and Dim Sum dishes warm.  They also have congee as well.I ordered the chive patties (gao choi), steamed ribs and a coconut bun.  The chive patties were okay, not that great.  In general, I like the vegetables inside the doughy outer shell to be a bit crisp to the teeth and sharp on the tongue, but this was rather mushy without much flavor.  The steamed ribs were the tastiest part, with the perfect seasoning (and truth be told, it's what saved this review from being just 2 stars).  The meat was tender and came right off the bone.Now the coconut bun, which is a baked bun with a coconut filling.  This is one of my favorite buns ever, right up there with a well made roast pork bun, so it really makes me a sad bunny when I have one and it's not so good.  This bun was big, but it didn't have white, granulated sugar on top like I prefer.  Inside?  Instead of coconut bits with a crystal sugar, it was a mushy, yellow cream that I have seen some other bakeries use instead.  This was not my type of coconut bun, and the taste was too over-buttery to the point where I couldn't even taste the coconut.  Blech.The service was prompt and efficient as they usually are in such bakeries.  I could see into the kitchen and the staff was hard at work.  It is rather impressive to see dumplings being made at rapid speed.I won't say that I would not go back to Yu King, but aside from the ribs, I'd most likely make different selections if I did go again."

But I still really like this place because the limited dim sum is good enough without much of a line and less hassle than going to a restaurant. The winners are really the egg custard tarts, roast pork buns (baked or steamed), sticky rice with sausage boiled egg wrapped in lotus leaves, and the rice noodles (cheurng fun). Getting the pain rice noodles is cheaper than getting ones with filling, and you get more. Rice noodles also come with sweetened soy sauce. The dim sum typically comes out freshly made around 8:30am on weekdays with better selection. Buns come out earlier."

Lines are quite long during breakfast hour. If you dine in, you usually see elders there, or with their grandchildren. But don't let this ruin the image of this bakery!I wouldn't regard ""Double Dragon Balls"" (its name in Chinese) a bakery even tho it sells baked goods, pastries, and drinks. I think its main selling point is their dimsum/breakfast items. This is one of the best places to eat real Cantonese dimsum/breakfast. Yes, most off them are oily & greasy (fried stuff), but come on, this is the Chinese taste! It's the same thing in Chinese big restaurants. Their chow mai fun (fried rice noodle) is great, fresh, has ""wok hey"", but yeah its greasy to most of you. Congee is good, too, very ""mien"", soft & thick. Then their steam dimsum, taro dumpling, cheung fun, i won't say their shiu mai's very good (lots of meat, i feel like just eating meat balls lol).Baked goods are okay. Just get their dimsum, fried noodles, congee! Too greasy to you? Then forget it. Other 'CBC' loves it tho!"

Not happy, rude, and made me not even want to step foot in there anymore.The pastries are still cheap, but i feel unsatisfied eating these buns because they remind me of those gloomy faces.

In my opinion, it's one of the few bakeries that has actually good dim sum. Lines form quickly at the bakery especially on the weekend and sometimes the line can extend out the door! I would not recommend eating at the bakery, since it is small and eating the dim sum at home is probably more relaxing. Definitely a bakery worth checking out if you want good dim sum for breakfast!"

This is queens not Manhattan.  Just a bagel with flavored cream cheese is 7.74. Lol Also had a ham and cheese Bagel sandwich. I wish the cheese was melted for $10 it was just alright.

They've got a wide menu and a variety of offerings including smoothies, salads, sandwiches, wings, burgers and quick picks-up like packaged fruit & drinks. Food prices are super affordable and apart from the bagels everything is seemingly made fresh to order, judging by wait time. This spot is jumping in the morning so be prepared for a wait in line. Beyond the morning rush, I haven't really dealt with a significant. As everyone has said, seating is limited. Two counters inside without four seats and then 3 or so tables out front. Staff is friendly! Regarding the food, it seems very middle of the line to me depending on the day. It's not horrible but it's not phenomenal. The burger tasted like a frozen patty. The smoothie was a bit bland (but maybe because it didn't have sugary mix-ins and had added protein?). The wings are okay, my son is obsessed with them. I'd say give it a go. For the price, it's worth experimenting"

I got the Kiev Panini and let me tell you when I split the sandwich into the cheese perfectly came apart and I was excited. It was everything I wasn't expecting but yet I knew this would be good. Even better that I got pasta salad on the side to just make the mayo gods sing in my belly. Overall we had a successful breakfast (after a night of shrooms). Looking forward to ordering again.

Not sides, not desserts, not any other food. Service and decor were not considered either.Visiting a new restaurant in my neighborhood called La Rotisserie du Coin triggered an obsession in me to find the best rotisserie chicken in Queens. For three days last week, I ate nothing but roast chicken.To be fair, I ordered the same half a chicken every time (except Costco) during busy lunch or dinner hours. Here are my findings below with a food score (independent of price or value) and some key notes for each establishment.LA ROTISSERIE DU COIN - 4/10, Chicken was barely warm and somewhat dry. This could be due to the fact that I was the only customer at 7:45pm. The skin had some hint of rosemary and other herbs, but the meat was quite bland. Restaurant had by far the nicest decor of all the chicken shops visited. Price ($12.85) for half a chicken with two sauces was also by far the most expensive.BOSTON MARKET - 5/10, Surprisingly better than LRDC, mainly because it was warmer and juicier. Skin had a stronger flavor of spices. The white meat was still slightly dry, but the dark meat was quite good. For $9.88 you get half a bird plus two sides.PIO PIO (Middle Village) - 8/10, My favorite roast chicken for a long time and it still does not disappoint. Super tender and juicy meat, along with amazingly tasty seasoning. $10 gets you half a pollo and endless green sauce (best of any restaurant that served it).COSTCO (LIC) - 7/10, Each chicken is time stamped. So fresh and hot, the box nearly burned my hands. While not as flavorful as some, it was definitely the juiciest and most tender. Possibly the most meatiest as well. Nowhere else I tried can beat the price of $4.99 for a whole entire chicken either.ROAST & CO. - 3/10, Lukewarm and quite dry. Unfortunately the worst of my experiment. My belief is that, due to their larger menu compared to the other similar restaurants, it's hard to keep the chicken fresh. Half a bird for $13.95 comes with two sides, which were decent.CARAVAN CHICKEN - 7/10, Similar to Pio Pio, but a little less tender, a bit less juicy, and the green sauce was not as thick. Skin has a little crispiness to it that no other roast chicken had. Fantastic buy at $7.21 for half.PEKING BBQ - 8/10, Same owner as Caravan Chicken, but the seasoning on the skin has a added sweetness (cha siu sauce) added to the traditional Peruvian herbs and spices. On the day I was there, I waited 20 mins for a new batch, which produced a better result. Once again, $7.21 for half a chicken is a great deal.In the end, this experiment proved something all foodies should already know ... ... everything tastes better when it's freshly made. Unlike a steakhouse that can fire up a piece of meat upon request, rotisserie chicken takes time to prepare and becomes overcooked the longer it sits in the oven. That's why places with consistent business will always win out in this race. If I have to pick one winner based on purely taste, then it would have to be Pio Pio. However, the biggest dark horse was definitely Costco. This was a fun experience, but I don't want to see another rotisserie chicken for months."

The worst part is that they send dried out food to the people who order online, I have had their food in-house and it's cooked perfectly fine. Every time I order online, dried-out food and the missing piece trick.I hope corporate pays attention to these reviews."

However this particular one could not be any more friendly if it tried, and I don't think it has tried to be more friendly because it's already perfectly friendly.I'm not a huge fan of the Boba here, but some of the other drinks are excellent and the decor is absolutely lovely.All in all, it's one of the nicest places to hang out in Chinatown. I would recommend coming in here to anybody, but maybe skip the bubble tea because I'm a huge fan of Bubble Tea in general, and this isn't some of the best stuff that you'll find.The 5 star is specifically for the lovely service, great decor, and products in general other than the Boba.Now it's time for me to slide into your DMs, and by your DMs, I mean the next review, which you have to admit is a pretty slick move on my part. Perhaps they should rename it the Slick Road Cafe."

Their ""outdoor"" seating is an enclosed extension of their restaurant so it is warm. Also, they do have electric heaters at each table making it even warmer. To start we ordered the meatballs, octopus and baked clams. The meatballs themselves were really good. However, the tomato sauce they used, while not bad, wasn't my favorite. It was more like a tomato soup than a suave/gravy. The baked clams were flavorful but the breadcrumb topping wasn't as crispy as I like it. The grilled octopus was fantastic! It was grilled to perfection and the seasoning was on point. For dinner I had the spinach and ricotta ravioli. The ravioli was amazing! The used the same sauce as the meatballs and for some reason it worked better with the ravioli. I also had some of my boyfriends linguini with clams and it was so yummy. It came with so many clams we weren't able to finish them all. My friend had the penne alla vodka and said while it was good it wasn't anything special. You have to try the panna cotta. It was delicious."

2501,okF1w-7gZNy2OB73SsjuYw,1/13/2019,3 star rating,"I came here on a brisky Friday night around 9pm with no wait at all. Before coming, I read the reviews and decided to search up the Groupon deal that everyone was talking about. I was lucky that the deal was still live- $30 for $60 worth, but the catch was that I had to order two entree meals. No problem at all. Wooden tables and chairs with a homey-feel. Nice place to be on unwinding from a long week on a Friday night. I was greeted by a gentleman who seemed to have the whole nightly special menu recited in his mind.We got served warm bread with a broccoli rabe spread with olive oil (with other ingredients, I forgot which). Personally, I didn't really like it so I opted to ask for olive oil & balsamic vinegar...can never go wrong with that. For the appetizers, I ordered the grilled octopus toppled over cold cannellini beans with celery. It was my first time having octopus like this over beans. Personally, I think the octopus was warmish-cold and of course, I wanted the octopus to be hot. I would've enjoyed it more if it was hot. We also ordered the arugula salad. Something simple--arugula tossed with basalmic & olive oil with mozzarella and cherry tomatoes. I was disappointed because there were three slices of mozzarella and not enough cherry tomatoes. The salad could've used maybe some truffle oil and a squeeze of lemon juice to enhance the flavors. For the entrees, we ordered the fresh fettuccine with seafood (special for the night) and the fettuccine with bolognese sauce. The fettuccine was definitely fresh, I give props for that. However, the seafood was salty and tasted frozen, but not frozen fresh. The clams, mussels, lobster, and shrimp tasted salty. If that makes any sense. It just didn't have that fresh seafood taste, but a frozen taste. Seafood shouldn't taste like that, if it was fresh. I was disappointed. The fettuccine with bolognese sauce was also salty for my liking. Wasn't feeling it. I ended up taking half of it to go because I couldn't finish it.All in all, the fettuccine was cooked al dente and it was fresh. Everything else, I question if it is. Service was good, live music was too loud for our liking to enjoy our dinner."

The food? Amazing! I wanted to wait to have some goood pasta in NY on my visit and this place didn't disappoint.  For starters we had some shrimp that was made with garlic and white wine..the table bread was delicious and the spread for dipping was all the way in flavortown. I ordered a mouth watering penne with a tomato sauce with olives and capers, garlic and a hint of rosemary...talk about goooooot! My gf ordered a bolognese  , she cleared her plate..she normally finishes like half her food..Anyhoo even if there's no Groupon available..still go, it's worth it."

This is a mostly a to go spot. The staff is friendly and the inside was clean. The wait for my order was about 15 minutes and they provided all condiments in your bag. The jerk chicken gyro was good but I feel that it could have been better. I did drop in fairly late within the day. The seasoned fries were good and the sauces that were provided were perfect. I will return to try other menu items.

With items such as BBQ Lamb, Grilled Shrimp and Shrimp Burgers it's like I stepped into beach life in Trinidad with a whole new world of flavors. I got the shrimp and fries and lamb and fries, though the seafood and meats and seasoned, I highly suggested you top your stuff with garlic sauce, pepper sauce and mango ketchup. The only reason they didn't get a five is because of delivery. They say they deliver but it shuts off after 5pm thought they are open until late at night. Not a good look."

There are only three tables so it's more of a takeout spot but since it was my first time I didn't want my food to be cold so we ate there. The staff there is very friendly and welcoming. I had the lamb and fries and my friend had jerk chicken and shrimp. The lamb was seasoned well and not too tough. the fries were sprinkled with some type of seasoning but tasted plain. They make a bunch of different type of sauces that really make the food taste good. The girl was nice enough to give me some of each so I could decide which I liked. I had chadon beni, garlic, tamarind, honey mustard, mango ketchup and another just taste like pepper. They are all good but my favs were the garlic and mango ketchup. My friends shrimp was just ok and the jerk chicken was seasoned well. It was an ok amount of food. I was full but not stuffed. I will go again to try the wings."

I ordered the Blue Raspberry Granita drink which was good. It was a little TOO sweet but still very refreshing on a 93 degree day! I also ordered a medium cup of one scoop of the Milano Cookie gelato and one scoop of the Coney's Custard - both of which were delicious! I will say the portion was a huge size and could easily have fit in 1 or 2 more cups! I would highly recommend this place and would love to come back next time!

2519,3Lj7gVcMG6hy9lv-4bdIBg,5/2/2018,5 star rating,"Coney Island gets hot along the Boardwalk. It's likely one will get a craving of ice cream. The problem is usually in this situation the ice cream will be mediocre and overpriced. Here not so, it's pretty good and didn't make me go broke. They have quite a few flavors and sorbets. At the counter you pay for your size before you choose the flavor. Once you get your bowl, you take it over to the person at the ice cream. The ice cream is about $6 for two fairly large scoops. It's quite a deal around here. They have many flavors to choose from, including vegan sorbet. It's only natural you need some ice cream walking along the hot Boardwalk. It may be hard to find somewhere to sit, so it may have to be the beach. That's okay, because you can get a tan enjoying some good cool treats."

Take a break from the beach or drinking and stop in here while you are on the boardwalk.Try one of their ridiculously delicious sugar cone with a combination of two tasty flavored ice cream. What?! All just $4 or so. Seriously what are you waiting for?! Come in and enjoy then again who doesn't like ice cream. My favorite ice cream flavor is vanilla with Oreo cookies. Totally worth it after a long day on the beach and sun.Don't worry you won't have to wait for an extended amount of time. There are a lot of servers that will quickly take care of you.If you are unsure of what flavor you would like then that wont be a problem. You can try sampling as many flavor as you want until you are fully satisfied.Looking forward to visit  again!

I have come here every time I visit for the past 3 years. I come here for one flavor in particular, the Milano cookie flavor. I get a small cup of Milano cookie, it has Milano cookie chunks in it and is one of those one of a kind flavors that I haven't come across anywhere else. I did also see a Nutella flavor on my last visit so I asked for a sample and it was delicious as well, but I still preferred the Milano cookie flavor. My SO typically gets a milkshake of the Milano flavor and I've stolen a few sips and it is just as delicious in any form. I highly recommend this particular flavor, the staff is really sweet about giving samples to customers and they have the sizes of all the cups in various places.

As soon as you exit Luna Park you'll find Coney Cones right on the board walk.  There might be a kind but they are quick.  I'm not a huge fan of gelato because it melts too fast but I had to give it a try.  It's only 90 degrees outside and NYC is humid as hell, got to get something to cool you down right? Well I had the double scoop pistachio and some other flavor I forgot lol but it was really good.  Only thing if melted fast.  At least with ice cream the consistency allows you to eat slit toe but before it darts melting but not gelato. It's melting from the second it comes in your hand.  Gelato was good but I rather have ice cream.  They also serve good slushy drinks and they are really good! Not your genetic 7/11 type slushy but some real good ish.Prices are fair as well.  I was expecting to pay outrageous prices because that's what everyone popular does these days but not the case here.  Anyways if your in the area, go give it a try and I hope you like it!"

She instead gave us an additional chair which didn't really help the situation.Onto the foodPierogies: love how they have the option to make them vegan. We got the fired version and we loved that it came out fresh and hot.Schnitzel bites: best dish! Perfect for sharing and it came out fresh hot and flavorful as well.Carrot salad: we like how they elevated carrots with walnuts and cinnamon without it being overly sweet. Very refreshing especially if you have lots is fried foodGolden beets: pretty standard, nothing to wow home aboutBeef kielbasa: also pretty standard, not as exceptional as the other dishes but the sauerkraut made it refreshingRed wine: love a chilled red especially for a hot summer day! And it was a pretty good deal for a bottleOverall food was delicious but had to knock out a star for how inflexible they were with seating especially since the restaurant was slow and had lots of seats available.

And that's why I think dumplings hold a special place in my heart - no matter what culture it's from.I grew to love these little potato and cheese filled dumplings, not from East Asia this time but from East Europe :) I got a couple as take-out from Baba's and they were amazing. It's a great pierogie spot to visit if you are in Brooklyn!! I ordered the classic boiled potato and cheese (please do yourself a favor and order it with the mushrooms, apple sauce and sour cream!) It's a delicious combo. I also got the fried jalapeno and cheese. Unfortunately, it got soggy by the time I made it home so I wasn't a huge fan but I still appreciate the dumpling. Topped it with some apple sauce and sour cream and it made it all better. Definitely do not get fried for take out - it's better to enjoy dining in."

Must love Mustard with the macaroni salad as its pretty strong. We liked the thick bits of bacon as add-ons but would pass on adding the extra onions, a little too vinegary for me. Unfortunately the schnitzel balls were a miss. They definitely needed some spice, maybe would've been better with the side of applesauce. Ultimately the service was great, everything was presented well and we were surprised they had happy hour there."

I typically go to locations in Manhattan, but the morning of the snowstorm the family had a hankering for something tasty. Something that would put meat on your bones. Time to visit the Downtown Brooklyn Sophie's. They recently shifted locations down the block (I think earlier this year they were closer to Willoughby! Now they're  just south of Brooklyn Tab on Smith).I've always been loyal to Sophie's for the oxtail and the empanadas. I also ordered the beef stew (ropa viejo) and a Cubano sandwich. The maduros are always excellent, I also like the string bean and beet salad. The side veggie medley always surprises me that they're cooked al dente and not a soggy mess. My one complaint is that Sophie's food is saltier than I typically would make my food, but for an indulgence, its okay. Portions are always good, I often have enough for a meal and a half. Prices are more than fair when you consider the quantity. Staff are responsive - they called me when one of my side dishes were out within a few minutes of the order going in.For COVID, the indoor dining is all packed up, and there is no outdoor seating. All order are to go. They have hand sanitizer and plexiglass to keep customers and staff safe. Everyone had gloves and masks. There are dots on the floor to remind you to social distance. On a Wednesday at noon, it was surprisingly empty here, it looks like they're surviving on the takeout business - call directly and shop local y'all."

It's mostly tasty** Cuban cuisine:The empanadas are solid, the ropa vieja is a nice plate (edges out the oxtail for me, but my mother would say the opposite), and the maduros, as always, are the best thing out.I wish their cubano was a bit juicier, and a bit better balanced, but you can't have everything in this life._____________ *But I'm not that embarrassed. I've been to other Sophie's locations, and it's not as if Sophie's a close, personal friend of mine. There are plenty of things in my life that I am far, far more embarrassed by. Humiliated, even.**Which is not as good a name as Sophie's, so I understand why they went with that."

Not only are they a tiny family business in the middle of nowhere (bonus for ""hidden secret"" status), the proprietors themselves somehow manage to do all the cooking & customer service & social media with a loving personal touch.First and foremost, excellent masa; but also worth mentioning are the beautifully herbed & spiced meats, and the legit best fruit-juices around. I really want to emphasize how grateful I am, that as a non-Spanish-speaking Hispanic, I received no sort of negative treatment whatsoever, which sadly is all to common, it's saddening when it happens and unfortunately it happens a lot, but these people here are kind and warm, and I will be back regularly."

This place is in the Hunt's Point section of the Bronx which is all industrial with tons of manufacturing and automotie businesses in the area. Getting here, particularly crossing the Bruckner, can be challenging as every crossing point seems to be flooded with trucks blockig intersections.Lots of cars are double and even trple parked throughout the streets. This place is on the main street of Oak Point Avenue which has a few angled parking strips nearby, which makes parking easy..and free...if you can find a spot. I visited in the eary afternoon on a Friday and was able to snag the last spot. Right now there is only outdoor seating and takeout only due to COVID. This place has a variety of dishes including a hot food tables (chicken, rice, pork...), empanadas and tamales of course. I got a few tamales and empanadas. Everything was very good. They were some of the best tamales and empanadas I've had. What really impressed me was the amount of filling (chicken, pork, veggies..) that were stuffed into the tamales and empanadas. My olny gripe is the price... I think $3+ per tamale may be a tad too much. I can go to Queens or Uptown Manhattan and get some great tamales for $1-$2 each. I would love to return to visit and try some other tamale varieties and even some hot food there."

I like how you can customize how much ice and sweetness. I actually have been coming across to that more lately. Back at home, we have some bubble tea places and I noticed these customized things. I also noticed hot and cold bubble tea to be very common in New York at least. I'm used to cold bubble tea. This place is legit from what I get back at home. I really liked this place. But I don't like their tapioca. Well they're okay. They flavored it weird. Different honey? But it was cooked nicely. Just flavored weird."

I had a not so great experience at kong fu tea in Seattle but the ones here are great! I guess the location matters. They give you choice for sweetness and how much ice. The medium size here is also just about right instead of those standard huge sizes which I can barely finish. They give you both black and white bubbles which is kind of cute. Really chewy and not overly sweet bubbles. Love it!

I wasn't impressed. The Hot and Sour Soup was very oily, and had morsels of pork floating all throughout the soup. The Lo Mein was pretty flavorless. The egg roll was REALLY soggy, not crunchy at all. The Sesame Chicken sauce was really goopy. Also the chicken was not crispy at all on the outside. But the one good thing I can say is the Sesame Chicken was mostly all white meat on the inside. Sometimes with that dish and General Tso's, it's a little scary looking inside the meat.

They always made my food the way I requested it (and I'm a little picky , even asked to make new panini because I don't like peppers) and they made it.

It was about 6pm and there were no other people waiting in line behind me so it wasn't like I was holding it up. He begrudgingly went and heated the last one up for me.The food was fine. Premade paninis reheated in a press. Nothing special, but it got the job done. The people at the register were nice and friendly.

Absolutely wretched.  Where do I begin?The food is disgraceful and disgusting. I've tried several different items from here and each one, for whatever reason, tastes like it has been doused in trans fat and synthetic cooking oil. The BLT for example has an artificial flavor. The most important ingredient, the bacon, isn't crispy but leathery. The service also makes you feel like you're bothering the people behind the counter. I'm lucky enough to have never experienced this but my friend has gotten food poisoning from here not once, but twice. To make matters worse, when they clean their kitchen slip mats, they do so on the sidewalk with a hose which turns the already disgusting area into an even worse pig sty.

The passionfruit one had a very nice, strong flavor with a standout tartness that left an imprint on your tongue. The foccacia with prosciutto was yummy. Pair any bread here with a soup and you're on your way.I regret not asking for our mini baguette sandwiches to be toasted. They were way too tough but the filling was good. A little toasting and they would've been perfect. Next time!"
2608,oIUdTViTYGfY9Tp6N8IfoQ,11/4/2022,2 star rating,This is for their Lexington location. It's cute. Great location. I thought the coffee tasted burnt/rough. Easily masked if you don't take it black. I brought my own 10 oz mug and they charged me for a large. Too many good options in the city to bother supporting lousy expensive coffee.

Of Yelp good review.  It's actually a cafe with all food prepped and pre package .I was disappointed....But since I was there I thout I'd give it a try.Goat cheese spinach salad.  Spinach is generic  。nothing special. Balsamic dressing was thick and no olive oil.  Quite disappointed.Large cappucino- was milky and coffee was not good.All that for $18 plus.    Not coming back here.

A cute, cozy setting and I was amazed we got two macarons, a spinach mushroom frittata, a latte, and an almond croissant for $23 including a tip! Everything was delicious. The almond croissant way maybe a tad hard but I think if I had it warmed it would have been perfect.  Would recommend this place any day."

The desserts went so well with cappuccino, which I got extra foamy. Definitely a quaint place to go for a quick meal."

2617,X52zxgnwA72PQqprxI_hEw,6/21/2021,2 star rating,"Pros: indoor seating requires vaccination proof, which we appreciated. Cons: slow service and slow food preparation (50+min for my avocado toast). Super weak or lack of AC on a 90+ degree summer day. Additionally, waitress needs customer service training. She didn't give us water or silverware even when the food was there so we ended just grabbing plastic ones by the counter. Then when I asked about my avocado toast, she literally said ""I only have two hands"", which was beyond the point. Clearly I wasn't asking if she is an octopus, I was asking if it's ready. Shrug*Won't be back even if I'm in the area again."

The chai latte was perfectly spicy and easily one of the best I've had, although a bit expensive, in true NYC fashion. The egg and cheese omelette wasn't particularly memorable, and I hated the heaping mass of arugula it came with. I should've requested switching it with an alternate side, like the fries. My boyfriend's burger came with fries, and the accompanying rosemary garlic aioli was heavenly. One of the best aspects of this place is its payment process. Scanning the QR code on the table enabled us to place our own orders that we could ultimately pay for separately, but be served together as a party.I'd definitely come here again, but I'd either order something different or come for dinner."

The playlist is the perfect blend of vibes and rhythm. Everything is phenomenal. You know a place is good when their fries are good. We ordered the chicken sandwich, the French toast, and the avocado toast. The chicken is perfectly cooked and battered. The honey pairs with both the sandwich and the fries in a way you would not imagine. Everything is seasoned excellently. None of these dishes miss. Special shout out to the Mocha as well! Perfectly balanced between sweet and bitter. Best cup of coffee I've had maybe ever. Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely give this place a try."
2620,X52zxgnwA72PQqprxI_hEw,4/2/2021,4 star rating,"This cafe by day, restaurant & cocktail bar by night establishment puts an emphasis on sustainability. The straws are made of paper, their wines are biodynamic, and they commit to supporting farmers as a restaurant. They might even use an alternative glass for their cups because one shattered in my partner's hand as they picked up their frose the other night. Since the glass cut up their hand pretty badly, the server did offer us many bandages and gave us a discount on our drinks, and after a quick clean up and a fresh new frose, we carried on with our night, and enjoyed an outdoor beverage on an unseasonably warm night. In fact it was so warm they didn't even have to turn on their heaters, so I can't speak to the strength of them, but the area was covered and shielded patrons from the elements, which was nice.The frose was really delicious and the alcohol in it was masked really nicely because based on the flavor I did not expect to get as buzzed as I did. I was actually thankful that we were required to order food because the blueberry muffin we got from them was delicious and likely prevented me from getting too faded.I'd love to return for dinner to see what the kitchen demonstrate their sustainable cooking chops."

The food and the drinks are fine, but your experience will be ruined by the lack of attention. We ordered drinks and they sat at the bar for over 10mins and my husband finally decided to just stand up and get them himself. No one really came to say anything about it - mind you the place had like 3 tables. Empty for a Saturday brunch. Its disappointing because this place is not cheap so the least I expect is good service when I already order through an app and am doing half the server's work. I don't think I'll be back - there are way better neighborhood bars/restaurants around."

2623,X52zxgnwA72PQqprxI_hEw,1/30/2023,2 star rating,"Edie Jo's serves diner fare with a more self-aware, gastro vibe, than your standard side-of-the-road greasy spoon. There is something charming, almost do-it-yourself, about its décor and set up: a prominently displayed open kitchen, the walk-up counter, the splashes of color and eccentric wall art. However, the appeal of Edie Jo's wears off quite quickly once one looks at the menu. Unlike many diners that offer a variety of diverse dishes, Edie Jo's has an unusually sparse menu populated by dishes that are not particularly interesting or unique; there is no distinctive ""Edie Jo"" flare to the ($13) avocado toast, ($16) bacon egg and cheese, or ($24) grilled salmon that justifies the price tag. The service, while being very personable and kind, is also exceptionally slow, and can be seen talking to each other or friends that have come in for midday drinks, instead of refilling drinks or attending to other customers. Overall, the food was forgettable but the wait for it was not. -HCLB"

It arrived around 40 minutes after--I was warned by the kind gentleman who picked up the telephone orders so I didn't mind. The sammie was cut into quarters which I thought was so cute! It was a decent sammie, and tasted like it was just made, but I did find that I didn't like the extra slice of bread in the middle (making it a triple decker) and the avocado was kind of scarce. I washed it down with a small Berry Tickler smoothie (strawberries, blueberries and banana I believe, $3.50), the whole time thinking that this was the best smoothie I've had in a while! It was sweet (although I was aware that they added sugar) and super fresh. I can't wait to order from them again and try all the different smoothies!Update:The chorizo torta is amazing if you like spicy!"

That and when I walked for too long in one direction, my spidey sense urged me to walk no farther.Franco's was a pleasant surprise. First of all, the place is clean and nice. Super clean. Perhaps the cleanest of all the restaurants in the vicinity. Second of all, the menu had more than heroes. They had quesadillas and fresh smoothies.Price-wise, everything here is cheap. You can get a full meal for $5 or $6. The food isn't stellar, but it does the trick and fills the tummy without emptying the wallet. Vegetarians will find options here, too. Ah yes, they also take credit cards!So far I've had the Chicken Quesadilla and Franco's Supreme, minus lettuce and tomatoes. The Quesadilla was basically just chicken and cheese, with some homemade salsa contraption on the side. Again, nothing stellar, but filling. The Franco's Supreme was also substantially portioned, and at my next visit I will inquire about toasting sandwiches.Almost forgot to mention, the guys are super nice.+1 Service+1 Cleanliness+1 Options+1 Bang for the buckGlad I came, and I will return and recommend."

When i get home i noticed my green was missing. Clearly on grubhub your menu states that the tacos come with a green sauce. I walked back to the restaurant, When i got there i asked the lady at the counter if i could please get the sauces on the side she got an attitude and told me if i wanted any sauces that i could paid for it. Please fix your staff. I manage a company in the lower east side and we buy lunch for our staff every other day from here. We are just not going to come back here again.

We ordered a chicken burrito, shrimp and chicken tacos, guacamole and chips and a torta along with an orange jarrito. We were able to snag the limited amount of seats allowing for all the ladies to have a seat. Now, these are not your flimsy under stuffed tacos. This store took pride in stuffing your ""wrapped food."" The chips came in a paper bag and were freshly made. They were crispy, not oily, with maybe a pinch of salt. The guacamole was smooth and chunky and was really good. It was nice and creamy with just enough squeeze of lime and touch of salt. I ordered cheese and guacamole with on my tacos and the flavors were so good. I'm not a late night eater but I couldn't help myself. The shrimp was seasoned perfectly and complimented the flavors of the guacamole. The taco shell was soft and not soggy (thank goodness) and had a good flavor. The chicken taco was seasoned just as well. The burrito was super stuffed so make sure you are hungry. It is super good as well as the torta. If I'm in the area I will be back."

As spice fiend who has been on the search for a dish to actually challenge my spice tolerance, this place has got me beat - especially the notorious Laab Ped (duck salad) where you can make your own lettuce/cabbage/cucumber wraps with the spicy duck that got me sniffling a little. Another must-get is the Salted Egg Yolk Squid for your fill of savory, creamy seafood that isn't too spicy, which made it a good counterpart. Portions here are decently sized and the menu offers so many things I didn't get to try so you will for sure catch me here in the future ugly-tearing-up (in good way) to another spicy dish."

Delicious and truly authentic Thai cuisine, with a sprawling wine and beer menu to match (my one gripe is no cocktails...but the food more than makes up for it.) This is an excellent place to come with friends and share dishes among one another--our waiter also helped choose suggestions and advised us on spice levels from dish-to-dish. The complimentary jasmine rice is a blessing for those who can't handle their spice as well. I loved the Kang hoh, which had a good kick to it and didn't overwhelm my palette. The tumeric sea bream is another good option for those who are more spice adverse. The panang stole the show in my opinion, which consisted of beef shank, coconut oil and Panang curry.

The flavors are definitely very unique. The price was definitely on the pricier side but for the portion it's quite large. I definitely tasted the culture and the authenticity was great. Do keep in mind some items do run out during the day so arriving early is a bonus. When I went they were missing a few dishes that I wanted to try but had to order something else cause it was out. 8/10 would come here for the flavor and the urge to try more things but for the wait and the price I might have to consider it.

I was sniffling and tearing up but I just wanted to keep on eating, but that was physically impossible. We ordered egg yolk squid, beef curry, and fried rice. SO SO GOOD, but also unbearably spicy. Don't think I'll go back just because the cuisine is not fit for my taste buds, but if you love spice and Thai food, this spot has very unconventional dishes that will blow your mind.Atmosphere 8/10Cute hole in the wall location.

We ended up seated at the bar, which was a great opportunity to see the chefs at work.  Excellent variety of beer, wine, and cider. All dishes were incredible, my favorite was the Nung Gai (crispy chicken skin), such a perfect amount of flavor and texture, definitely has a kick. Kang Hoh (red curry pork shoulder with glass noodles) has a kick to it!  Tom Som Pla Kra Pong (red snapper in a ginger tamarind broth) was refreshing and has a bit of an acidic kick with the tamarind. Tong Pad Kai (kabocha squash, straw mushroom, egg, basil) didn't seem spicy at all and was nice to round out the meal.  We were told that 4 dishes is too many for a group of 2 and to order 2-3 next time but no regrets, we had amazing leftovers for a couple of days.  Would love to come back to try the prix fixe experience ($55 per person for groups of 6 or more)."

Literally the best Thai food of my life. You preorder everything and everything was cooked to perfection!! *hor mok pu (grilled banana leaf wrapped crab meat curry custard) super soft, rich, and flavorful and very aesthetic looking! 9/10* kang hoh (pork shoulder and glass noodles) this dish was SO AMAZING AND FLAVORFUL! The pork was so tender the veggies seasoned to perfection and the glass noodles actually perfect but sooo spicy I was sweating! 11.5/10* pla tod kamin (fried sea bream) sooo tasty and came off the bone perfectly! 10/10"

The waitress was very nice at helping us choose what to eat. We ordered kang prik (spare ribs and birds eye chili curry), khoong muk kai kem (shrimp, squid, and salted duck egg yolk), and the kang hoh (hung le, red curry paste, pork shoulder, and glads noodles). All of them were flavor bombs, every single bite is a blessing. My favorite was the kang prik, even though that also hurt the most to eat.We came on a Saturday night with no reservation. The wait was about an hour, and we passed time at a bar nearby. Service was very attentive despite how crowded the restaurant was. The place is small but they fit enough tables in there and it seemed like they were happy to sit large groups of 6+ people.This restaurant doesn't mess around, mild is hot, and spicy is SPICY. If you can't handle the heat - start building up your spice tolerance now because you don't want to miss out on this place."
2656,XpgquUrYWa-URbgi-3pykg,12/21/2022,4 star rating,"Good Thai food, but doesn't beat Fish Cheeks / Soothr / Wayla / Somtun Der in my opinion. We got the chicken dish, seabass, shrimp and squid, and a beef soup. Dishes were kind of spicy but not as spicy as anticipated. They are great about refilling water. Looks like a hole in the way but there are always people waiting outside. They kicked us out after 1h for a group of four. Not the nicest but it's alright--I get it. Prices are manhattan-level Thai prices."

2658,KJFosOrLotvQo_rntg0sjA,12/5/2021,4 star rating,I took the family to dine on a Sunday evening. We asked to be seated on the heated patio. This could be the locale for my  daughters sweet 16 dinner in February.  We ordered a multitude of appetizers and the plates were cleared well before our entrees arrived. We wet our palate with bottled still water. Myself and the future celebrant ordered ribs with a side of tater tots for me and French fries for she. The serving size is outstanding as I could not finish and subsequently shared.Everyone from my twelve year old with a particular palate was happy with the cuisine. Th as most to a Yelp Elite event for introducing me to this restaurant.

I previously went to a fun event here and decided I wanted to support this place bc it's new and I decided to have date night here and I completely regret it. To start, I ordered the ribs and it came with no side, NOTHING. Just ribs on a plate. The sauce was very sweet and the ribs had all fat on them. For $24 they could have included some sort of small side, something to cut the sweetness of the rib sauce. I also would have appreciated a heads up that my entree does not come with a side, I would have definitely ordered something else. Luckily, my husband ordered the burger and that was pretty good (I tried it)  it came with a side of fries and a small salad. It was also cheaper than my meal. Sigh. Someone needs to look into the menu. The cocktails were decent but be AWARE you'll be charged an additional tax on your food AND drinks. I've attached the receipt bc it still doesn't make sense that a $15 drink (labeled as such on the menu) came out to be almost. $18. I asked one of the bartenders about this and he had no idea. I will not return unfortunately and I beg you guys  be sure to check your bill before paying. To clarify the ribs are $22 on the menu but we were charged $24.96 like why!"

Both times the service was great, staff was very friendly, and food was delicious.

The decor is really cool with great lighting and just an overall nice vibe. There is a large bar area, plus restaurant seating. For dinner, we opted to try a bunch of apps and eat tapas style. First, we had the Brussels sprouts with olive oil and bacon which was really tasty. Next we had the calamari which is a staple food for me whenever i go out to eat. I have to admit, their version wasn't my favorite and I normally loveeee calamari so it needs some work. Next, we had the pulled pork tacos which were out of this world and ended up being our favorite dish of everything we got. We also had the steak carpaccio and bone marrow which were both pretty good and came out with a really yummy bread. I hope this place does well because it looks like it has a lot of potential."

I came into this Starbucks to get my usual, since I was waiting on a client I decided to dine in for a few min. Once I sat & started eating. This woman from behind the counter with braids think her name is Tamara. Don't quote me. Started shouting ""Girl"" from the other side of the facility. Not knowing she was calling me. After her continuously yelling I looked up & She called me to the counter. To fill out a covid monitoring sheet. Which is perfectly fine, honestly it slipped my mind. Once she got my information her comment was "" Jesus it's like pulling teeth"" because I was not comfortable giving my full address. Mind you she was not working the register because 2 other people were. It was not busy where she couldn't come to where I was sitting at & speak to me directly The point is wether this person was having a bad day or not! There needs to be some type of professionalism tone when speaking with paying customers. The encounter I had in Starbucks today was so not ok & neither was the nasty attitude I received when I was simply complying with they're rules & regulations."

Why the baristas feel it appropriate to call a Trans woman ""sir"" each time I'm in full make-up and long hair I do not know.

On my cup they wrote Duck. Com'monNo other Starbucks in the city struggles with getting my name correct than this Starbucks!!! I'm mean really.

They were kind, fast, and accurate with my order.  Not only that, but they managed to stay on top of the seating area.  It was clean, and I saw multiple baristas taking time to wipe tables where guests had just left.  They were well-staffed and on top of their stuff, and I appreciated it.  In terms of space and layout, the café was great on both fronts.  The seating area was set apart from the line and waiting area, so there was plenty of space to sit and read before I had to get to the office.  Listen, it's a Starbucks.  There's not a whole lot to say.  They're consistent, and this one was particularly well-adept at handling their busiest time of the day."

Five stars are no longer 5starts.Reviewers are getting out of control.  Hope More awareness gets around. What you think you are just writing a review. Think again. It's not just a review what your doing is closing down business. If you have nothing nice to say don't say them at all. Went there and got a sample of all these different flavors. They are so so good. I have no but good things to say for this place. I want to get a wedding cake from them! I got these huge slices of cake. It was so unique and deliciousPls go to this place.

The cupcakes themselves were delicious -- wished I'd had the opportunity to try more flavors, but I loved the funfetti, the strawberry, lemon meringue, and chunky monkey. The cake was moist and flavorful, and the frosting was fluffy and not too sweet."

Keep in mind that this location is a small shop/stand in a train station, so there's no seating area and the place is very small."

The picture of the steak above us was nothing like she was served. Her steak looked worse than dog food. I tasted it and it was dry, flavorless mush. On top of that, her salad bowl had wet lettuce leaves as big as her face. They practically served whole lettuce leaves. The only part of her meal she enjoyed was the soda on the side. Please save your money and go to an autorice spot instead or even Dos Toros. They know how to make a good steak."

They completely messed up a margarita I ordered and put HONEY in it because they ran out of something without letting me know. They to get my attention the Called across the restaurant to get my attention. I ignored them on purpose and they laughed like it was funny. Completely unprofessional and rude. I will not be back to this location EVER. I will be calling higher ups for chipotle and letting them know how bad this location is. I cannot believe it.

Fine, I'll manage. I then ask for brown rice and am told they don't have any ready so I'll have to wait. Cool, I take white instead. Name off the other things I want, get to the add-ons section and when I ask for guacamole the one guy putting my order together snickers with the lady at the cash register, turns back to me and says ""you know it's $2.67 extra, right? That's fine?"" And I say yes, I'll still take it. They look at each other and snicker again. I get over it, people are weird and rude so I move on.My boyfriend is in the line behind me, waiting on brown rice. He comes to pay for ours and I ask for a side of chips. They're out of chips. At this point, nothing surprises me and I just want to get out of here ASAP.The brown rice comes up, four other people are in line and they proceed to make everyone else's orders (all while having terrible attitudes to them and zero customer service skills) while my boyfriend has to stand and wait in the entire line *again*. THEN, (yes, there's more) while all these people are waiting the guy making the orders literally turns away, goes to huddle with the other workers in the back and everything is basically at a stand still. The service here is kind of horrendous and, honestly, if you're out of so many ingredients (literally four ingredients) you should be even nicer to your customers than before. I'll avoid this location at all costs and recommend the same for others."

I assume theyre management of some type. One gentleman asked to take my order with no mask on. I asked him to put one on because the delta varient is causing cases to rise and we are still in a pandemic. he said he would and left. He returned still with no mask on, as well as the other man who i didnt recognize who was handling food without a mask.

The meat here is fresh as there's a high turn over especially during lunch. The portion size is appropriate for the price. $9 for a burrito however good luck trying to finish it, you will be stuffed. This location is clean, the staff is friendly and it's usually less crowded than the other 2 in the area (Montague and MetroTech). For lighter fare try the tacos with your choice of chicken, beef,  pork or tofu.Though they're owned by McDonald's, their non-gmo produce and pledge to source local ingredients still wins me over to this day."
2693,5Styx6m546ie_9YR_XQW3g,7/8/2015,3 star rating,"I had the pleasure of visiting this location a few days ago. It's relatively small juxtaposed to the Montague street location. There were a couple of nuances that I've noticed while I was here. The foil wraps were too small for the tortilla, so yes they most likely will be touching the counter. Make sure that you let the workers making the burrito know that you aren't interested in your food possibly touching the counter. They were also out of fajita vegetables. I hadn't had Chipotle in a year and a half. I love the taste of the burrito but I do not miss it. As I can recall last year, a barbacoa burrito was $9. The price at the moment is now $9.75. That's quite a hike in prices. When I had my first burrito, I had the pleasure of eating the party sized burrito which instantly made me full. I do not get full from eating a burrito. Usually when I buy a plate of food at around $10, I can save some from it, but you can't with Chipotle for obvious reasons. I understand that the price for the burrito will continue increasing and I do not see the point in paying so much for something that I can make quite easily in my house.I'm not here to go off on a wild tangent but...I still like the food and I from time to time, if I'm feeling like it, I'll stop by Chipotle."

I had to wait 10 minutes for a fork. They made all of us very uncomfortable and ruined our evening.In total, we spent roughly $150, but because only one of us was drinking, this was not enough for this greedy ""small business owner.""  On top of that, their tap water tastes terrible and they do not have water, tea, or coffee.  The food was also very sub-par and the menu is quite barren.  Some advise, why don't you work on improving your bar rather than snapping at customers?"

Multiple TV's visible from any table or bar seat.  Bartender amendable to changing to game of your choice. Food is meh ... and a true Chicago dog it is not ( see pic ). Only one bathroom for the whole place so beware how many beverages you drink. Not my favorite.

I came here a few times and it was always just ""okay,"" but the last time really left a sour taste in my mouth. These buffoons have no idea how to run an establishment. This place is a MESS. I came here after work to meet my slime piece; she got there a little bit earlier being eager to see me. She came outside to keep me company as I stood in line and to drive off other ladies (what can I say?) but the bouncer, a complete hoser, told her to go to the back of the line even though she was already inside. We were shocked. The guy looked like a complete wet noodle too. Weird that a bar would hire a bouncer who looks that weak; can't imagine him running a tight ship physically or mentally. I guess it's tough being such a massive jabronie. He probably got jealous due to a lack of feminine comforts. We get inside and the place is full of degenerates. I'm starting to believe the big apple really is a hive of scum and soy. For a bar that's been around since prohibition, you'd think the joint would be a little classier. At least the place smells its age. Complete buffoons to the left and right of me. I started to worry what my broad might think of me so we had to slam our drinks and dip (we went to a much classier joint afterwards). If you're a soyboy hoser who hates trapping power, the grindset, or the finer things in life, this bar is just the one for you."

I've noticed this several times now, unless you have exact change, one of the vendors tends to take 25 cents from you when giving you back your change. EVERY TIME. My brother once called her out on it, and you could tell it wasn't an honest mistake, she kind of gave him the death glare and reluctantly handed him the 25 cents she had stolen. Maybe the workers' wages aren't enough, and maybe it's tough for them, but stealing is fuckin' petty. If she had ASKED for it, I would've given it to her. But she had to go behind my back.

See, I used to live closer to Savoy Bakery when they were located on 8th Avenue and 59th.When I was a just a teenybopper, my dad brought me to Savoy regularly for cold drinks and miniature cakes that cost $0.60 (back in the days.) He came here for birthday cakes, too. Even before they moved, I'd visit the bakery several times a week for my usual cup of iced coffee with tapioca pearls. I also enjoy buying their American style cheesecake. (The other bakeries I've been to can't seem to make cheesecake the right way.)The food here is quite cheap, and nonetheless delicious. The friendly lady at the counter still remembers me as a returning customer before I moved. Because now Savoy is conveniently located near the D train station, so I can get breakfast on my way to school or grab a quite bite after school.I bought a pork banh mi today after reading a raving review about Savoy's banh mi sandwiches. It was pretty good. A little bit on the salty side, but it tasted quite different from the typical banh mi I've eaten from other places. They're priced at $3.75, so you can't go wrong! I'll try the chicken one next time.P.S. -Despite what the previous reviewer, Kiki, had said about the rude employee, the friendly employee I had a conversation with laughed about the lychee smoothie story when I mentioned about a bad review on Yelp, and knew who Kiki was referring to. The friendly employee told me to rest assured that the woman who overcharged Kiki's drink is no longer a part of their staff. They do take feedback into consideration. Good businesses rely on feedback from their customers in order to improve their goods and services."

2729,dfuedxl8OncQJuF_SWNKig,12/19/2022,3 star rating,"Not my favorite. I think what this place might do best is not what I care about. They emphasize (and charge for) the organic, high quality meat, then their ""signature sauce"" covers whatever flavor the meat might have with spicy - that seems more like what a fast food chain would pull. It would be nice if they mentioned that the signature sauce is spicy, as I HATE the stupid trend in food to make the default in food that everything is ""x, but spicy"". The taste overpowered everything I ate. They should also look into a different eco-packaging supplier - we did take-out, and everything was lukewarm 15 minutes after we left (we had grabbed an Uber, so not like we were walking in the cold)."

The food here is solid if unspectacular. They make a nice, stacked BLT that can be upgraded to a BLEAT with fried egg and avocado, and might be my favorite of what I've tried here. And they do serve fry up some damn tasty fries and onion rings!I love me some lamb, and the Village Lamb Burger sounded like a nice combo of ingredients. However, I thought the raw peppers on top kind of overwhelm it--wish they were grilled like the onions, or otherwise just recommend omitting. The grilled chicken was a little overcooked and dry the one time I tried it. They seem quite busy still, which is good. I have had to wait past the provided pick up time for takeout every time, but I am trying to be more understanding of that these days than I normally would be!"

Good selection of your regular Mexican fare with only a small deliver feeBetween two people, ordered the Veggie Avocado Burrito ($15.50), Alambre Tepito Nachos ($16.25), and a pair of Campechano Tacos ($10.50). Definitely pricier than other similar spots, but was hopeful on the quality of the food. Order arrives within the delivery window, thankfully still warm enough to not reheat. First off, the nachos are fantastic - a dense layering of chips, cheese, guac, sour cream, salsa, and every meat imaginable. One of the few times where the chips made up the least amount of the dish. As for the tacos, saltier than I would have liked, and the tortillas were stale. On a positive note, the ingredients are generous and the extra sauce on the side balanced out the flavors.Again considering the price, wouldn't order here as often. Would like to try in person at some point."

The burrito was MASSIVE. It had red and green bell peppers, tomatoes, squash and avocados. It was also filled with beans, rice, pico de gallo, cheese and sour cream. The burrito came out to around $12, which is a little bit higher in price point. However, this is New York after all.I didn't take a picture of the inside of the burrito, because trust me, it didn't look appetizing. I promise it was delicious though! Definitely ask for the green and avocado sauce! Both aren't spicy, but they add extra flavor. The cashier was super nice. The service was great. Nothing fancy for a taqueria. The prep time is a but longer, but I wanted to note that there was only one chef. So, you have to be patient, because it's truly out of everyone's control.

When I picked up the order, one of the gentlemen behind the counter did not let me lift a single finger, and carried the trays out into my car as a courtesy!!
