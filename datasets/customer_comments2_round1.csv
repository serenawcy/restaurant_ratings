I believe Jamie took care of me at check-in. I explained my situation and he provided me with a complimentary upgrade and free breakfast. The room was super cute with a nice view and very trendy decor. Its tiny and the walls are kinda thin but it was about $120/night so great value for the area and the service. I tried a few of the other spaces on the property (Bar, restaurant, rooftop). They all fit the vibe of the hotel. The biggest con is that the lobby bar lacks sockets so its difficult to post up and work there all day. Overall, I'd come back."

My boyfriend and I booked a room and made a dinner reservation for February 14th weeks in advance because we expected the holiday rush. When we got to the hotel, we had a couple hours before dinner so we decided to call and push it from 8pm to 7:30. They agreed. Before heading down to dinner, we decided to take pictures out on the balcony. When we tried going back inside to our dismay the door was locked. We called hotel staff to unlock the door and after 5 attempts and 40 minutes, they finally were able to unlock the door. We were outside in 30 degree weather and I only had on a dress. I had enabled the safety lock on the door while we were getting dressed, which became another issue. They had to break through the door lock in order to get into the room. Once inside, they unlocked the balcony door and inspected it. We were told the door shouldn't, but it has an auto lock that the staff should be more aware of. It's dangerous for families staying here as well; god forbid a child got locked out.After getting out, we missed our dinner reservation so the night manager escorted us down to the restaurant. We waited for 10 minutes so the night manager could inform us the restaurant was full due to an error on their part with the booking system. At this point, the night wasn't looking great as we had nowhere else to eat!They tried to offer us a lobby couch and a small table to have dinner on, which is not what either of us were picturing. After another 15 minutes they pulled a table and chairs from somewhere and gave us a makeshift place seating. We were the only ones in the restaurant not having the same romantic dinner experience as anyone else. Dinner was okay, but you're better off going somewhere with better food.Overall I was very disappointed with the experience, seeing how the Candlelight Series hosted there made us want to stay! If you choose to stay here beware, you might be stranded on your balcony with staff who will tend to you at their own convenience."

The service is great and everyone is kind and helpful when you need. The food and room service is really good. The location is near every other hotel so if you don't want to eat here, feel free to walk a couple of feet to the next place. Halal truck parked on the corner and deli across the street.The bed is so comfortable and the showers are so pretty. It is a small space and hot giving holiday in rooms but you will enjoy. I had a balcony in my room but it was too cold to even enjoy."

I then got the Williamsburg Deluxe, which sounded great on the menu as it was described as a half pound wagyu burger. Turns out the beef patty was a tad bit dry and though the sauce tasted good, I was a bit irked that I ended up with a drippy and pretty soaked bottom bun halfway through. All in all, vibes and portion sizes were good but everything else was just okay."

We were in a cabana (the one in the middle) did not come with curtains or any shade at all. The response we got was only two of cabanas have curtains and the hotel ordered more however it didn't come in yet. This was not an appropriate response for a hotel which had advance notice and knew guests were coming . Two nice and tall girls Sammy and another Girl and the security guard (forgot everyone's names by now) three of them were most helpful that day . They went the extra mile and tried to hang towels for us and did the best they could to create some shade and cover for us. The three staff members did their best in service recovery, apologized on behalf of the hotel while helping my group of friends . I wish I got their 3 names because they are excellent!"
5,xsrzs3lSD2-xG889sLqAXA,6/30/2022,4 star rating,"If you're ever looking for a fun night out, head to the Williamsburg Hotel Rooftop Pool & Bar. This is one of my favorite rooftops in NYC, with one of the best views of the skyline.This rooftop has it all - views, food, drinks and live music. There are three main areas you can chill at.- Poolside: If you're looking to sit, chill with friends, have some food and a drink with some background music that's the place for you.- The Rooftop Bar: If you're looking for an outdoors party, go hang by the DJ booth. Grab some drinks at the bar and you'll be sure to have a fun dance party. - The Water Tower: This is my favorite of the three. Floor-to-ceiling glass windows with an amazing view of the skyline. Beautiful lights that give the place an intimate vibe. A small area to make it feel like you're in someone's living room. And of course, live music to make sure you're dancing the night away.In terms of food... We kept it super simple and ordered:- Chips & Guac: The Williamsburg Hotel is one of the ONLY places I've been to with more than enough chips to go with more than enough guac. It was the perfect serving for a group of 4. And it was obviously delicious since there was not even one chip left.- Baja Fish Tacos: I was SO surprised by these. These were SO good!! The fish were cooked to perfection and were actually crispy - which I loved! The sauce was on point and honestly the perfect complement to the fish - it was a Chile Arbol Aioli, and was just the right amount of spicy and creamy. Delicious. These are definitely on the smaller side so keep that in mind depending on how hungry you are!For drinks, I tried the Laguna Sunrise, and was very happy with my choice. It felt like I was sipping on Orange and Cantaloupe juice, but with a hint of sweetness/flora to it (which was probably due to the saffron). Loved it.Only reason I'm giving this place a 4 and not a 5 is that it's actually easier and quicker to get up and order directly at the bar than at your couch/table, which was pretty counterintuitive. If you want a couch/chair/table and want a break from dancing/standing around all night, make sure to grab a reservation at sevenrooms.com/reservati… - Shoutout to Austin who was super nice and super helpful in getting us booked at the greatest area!"

This was my first time at the Williamsburg Hotel Rooftop Bar and it certainly won't be my last. We didn't stay long as I didn't have a jacket and it got really chilly, despite it being a beautiful day in November. To get to the bar, you walk over by the elevators and wait in a line to get on to go up. The line was short so we got up within minutes of walking in. The views were gorgeous and I could only imagine hanging out here on a warm summer night. I didn't eat or drink so I can't tell you how that is but I can surely tell you that this is where you want to come for a fun night out."
7,xsrzs3lSD2-xG889sLqAXA,6/30/2022,4 star rating,I came here to hear an out of town indigenous performer and medicine man perform Amazonian songs. The place is utterly beautiful. You enter the entrance and then you take the stairs down then you have to take an elevator to go to the rooftop.I felt bad that there was a father with his little toddler going to the event with his ticket and he was turned away because of his child. There was nothing on the event flyer saying this but it's no fault of the hotel.Although the line to the event is long it went rather quickly.Three event was supposed to be at 6 PM but the music didn't start till 830.. The staff was very professional and courteous I have attached some pictures. The drinks or in the $18 an up range.
8,xsrzs3lSD2-xG889sLqAXA,6/24/2022,4 star rating,"I love the views of the Manhattan and Brooklyn. The drinks were good and the tacos and guacamole was tasty. I tried the fish and birria tacos. The consome was delicious. I had the playa margarita which was Casamigos, watermelon juice, and cilantro syrup. Very refreshing and tasty with the right amount of alcohol.The downfall was they only placed straight electronica/EDM all night long. The seating arrangement is super cute and there is no dress code. The pool is for hotel guest only and the staff was friendly. At times it was a wait to order. I recommend coming early so you can get seating and make a reservation."

It was crowded, but the bartenders were very efficient and we didn't wait long for mixed drinks. They serve carafes of their signature cocktails, which were all delicious! My favorite had mint and cucumber. The decor was definitely my vibe, which was had tropical decor, disco balls, and awesome lighting"

13,huOYFLpe3EQKFeDVoxk6Hw,3/16/2023,3 star rating,"Went here on a Tuesday night to grab a drink before a super late dinner rez at a restaurant around the corner. The lighting and decor was retro, funky and cool with a Hawaiian feel to it. There were hardly any people there but for a Tuesday night I guess that's the way it is. Unfortunately the drinks didn't really hit the mark for me - I asked for a Mojito and got a super sour cocktail with a mysterious red topper. Bartender was attentive but seemed a bit stand offish. Probably not going to come back here any time soon."
14,huOYFLpe3EQKFeDVoxk6Hw,9/12/2022,4 star rating,"Stumbled across this place on a whim with a girlfriend and I'm so happy I did! VERY cute decor. I got this drink with lavender in it because any time I see a drink on the menu with lavender or pear, I go for it. I don't see it on the online menu, but this drink was as DELICIOUS as I expected it to be. Also, the BONSAI CHICKEN BITES? PERFECTLY crispy on the outside, juicy inside, well seasoned, with a mayo dipping cup on the side, this place secretly knows how to do chicken WELL. And to top it off, the bartenders were SO friendly and personable, this place was just great vibes.I have to come back for more of this chicken and because they also had an Arnold Palmer with iced tea, lemonade, and vodka, which is also one of my favorite drinks. These cocktail makers here got SKILLS."

16,huOYFLpe3EQKFeDVoxk6Hw,8/18/2022,4 star rating,Came in for one drink on a Saturday night - cute spot and they were playing the BEST 80s music.Drinks are good. Really enjoyed the mai tai. Good for big groups but you'd probably want to make a reservation. We were a walk-in of 2 and had to stand at the bar. It's pretty loud but that was the vibe. Would come back to try other happy hour deals on weekdays for sure.
17,huOYFLpe3EQKFeDVoxk6Hw,3/17/2023,5 star rating,Entertaining happy hour spot with slightly pricey cocktails and a selective--but appetizing--food menu that all come together as a low key spot for a post shift hangout. $13 a drink. 4.25/5 stars as a happy hour bar.
18,huOYFLpe3EQKFeDVoxk6Hw,9/24/2022,4 star rating,"Cute spot, drinks aren't too expensive for NY either. They also have some specials throughout the week. Would recommend!"
19,huOYFLpe3EQKFeDVoxk6Hw,3/8/2022,4 star rating,"I am loving the vibe here! Think.... tiki bar with a disco ball. Cool x10. I want to bring friends here, dates here, there really is no bad occasion. They have booths, high tops, I've been here a few times on weeknights for after work drink and weekends for after brunch drinks and it's usually never without some crowd. I'd make a reservation if you are looking to get a table, otherwise I believe you can just hang out at the bar no problem. I've only ever had the drinks here but they've always been a hit! I got the Pineapple express with mezcal here on my last visit and plan to get it for the rest of my visits forever... it was so great. I switched it up with a spicy marg for the next round but I just missed my pineapple express. They have a section of their drink menu where they give you all the ingredients, you just pop in what kind of alcohol you'd like. Loved that! You can stick to the same liquor all night and still mix up your cocktail choices. I will come here again and probably again after that. A very cool spot in the west village for sure."

I would never eat here again i don't recommend this place or wish this experience on anyone! Stay away be warned!"

It hits the spot every SINGLE time. The bacon stuffed burger, sweet potato fries, regular fries, Philly cheese steak, wraps and those god damn milkshakes are so good. My son loves the Oreo cookie milk shake, I thoroughly enjoy the Creamsicle milkshake. My boyfriend enjoys it to. The meatball parm is delicious. The smoothies are also great. The cheesecake is good too. Save money and order breakfast and lunch at the same time."
55,t8qu-eZMI7Y71QDIpOqBLA,11/4/2019,3 star rating,So this is my breakfast place for eggs. I like the way they do breakfast The chef in the morning has been there for years. He knows when he sees me its going to be the same order. I also like the morning ot.eal although they can cut back on the sugar. Fresh cinnamon  sticks helps to make this meal delish. The owner chris amd his brothers have been here sense jesus walked the earth. Yes forever. The prices have always been sky high and NEVER ONCE have they offered me a birthday discount on a meal but its ok. When i am in this area I stop in just for eggs.

Their delivery timeframe is always on point and their food is reliable and good. In particular, I enjoy their Portobello Philly cheesesteak (vegetarian) in a ww wrap with provolone cheese. I also really like their cream of broccoli soup with cheddar. Everything is always packaged well so extra points for presentation! Down a star because the desserts they offer aren't great at all... however, I think the price-point for the desserts is at the right spot considering the quality so there's that."

They refused to refund me for this because they said the only way I would know it was undercooked is if I ate it. Well hopefully I don't die smh won't order from here anymore.
60,FVGTLWis-xBCrLmprgVXEg,12/9/2022,5 star rating,"Always so good!!The two great halal Persian restaurants that I love in the city are Miraj and Ravagh. Now, I had been a Ravagh girl for a long time but I think my husband has finally converted me. Both are delicious but since this review is for Miraj, I'll elaborate for Miraj specifically.Their meat is always cooked to perfection and they have the most delicious white sauce and green hot sauce! The white sauce is like a traditional NYC cart style white sauce and the green sauce is very similar to what you would find at an Afghani restaurant so best of both worlds! I'm usually used to eating my Persian food with a yogurt based sauce but the white sauce is much welcomed.On to the meats - our favorite and go-to is their kabab barg which is the beef  cubes. Sometimes I'll get the chicken cubes which are equally delicious. Last time we went, my parents got the cornish hen and it was SO tender! All the meats are always cooked so well and the portion sizes are LARGE. I get the cranberry rice with it as well. We usually also get the Shirazi salad on the side. Any time we have family in town, we come here so it's definitely worth checking out, especially if you're in the area! The ONLY downside is they close somewhat early at 9pm but we've been able to comfortably come for dinner several times despite this. 10/10 recommend!"
61,FVGTLWis-xBCrLmprgVXEg,2/21/2023,4 star rating,"Take advantage of their lunch special on weekdays. I tried their eggplant spread topped with yogurt - with pita. Their gormeh sabzi was delicious and my favorite. Comes with beautifully cooked rice. Persian tea was good too. Reasonably priced delicious food.We went for their early bird dinner special and the service was ok, with mostly empty restaurant. Seems groups friendly."
62,FVGTLWis-xBCrLmprgVXEg,2/7/2023,4 star rating,"got a lunch combo for $14. came with hummus, salad, saffron rice, meat of choice (i got the beef strips), and sauces. it was ready for pick up when i showed up and it was a very cozy family friendly mom n pop environment. price is fair and the hummus tasted great! for the kebab plate, it wasn't quite my favorite. the odd bits of sweet fruit like apricot and such in my kebab plate really turned me off, but this is personal preference. I did appreciate the almond and pistachio inside! i will likely go elsewhere but it was worth a try"
63,FVGTLWis-xBCrLmprgVXEg,1/5/2023,3 star rating,"Came here on a Sunday night and it was completely empty and eerily quiet. To start they gave us fresh pita and tzatziki sauce, and also some sort of green pickled sauce. Both were okay and I wouldn't pay for them. For dinner we ordered -hummus 7/10- standard hummus, nothing special. Didn't have any olive oil garnish which is my favorite part -chicken breast kabobs and bone in chicken kabobs- the kabobs themselves were good, but the sides were super underwhelming and bland. Plain white basmati rice, raw onions and a half roasted tomato. I asked for hot sauce and they brought out little packets of sauce which were not good. I think they could have done a lot more with the dish to make it better! The sides ruined an otherwise good kabob Overall I'd go for just the kabobs, don't expect much from the sides it comes with or the apps"
64,FVGTLWis-xBCrLmprgVXEg,10/28/2022,5 star rating,"Absolutely looooooved this place and it has beat out my former favorite halal/Mediterranean spot. We ordered a combo plate, expecting it to be fit for one person, and ordered beef stew with yellow peas. We were very very wrong about the portion for the combo plate - it was huge! It came with chicken, beef, ground beef skewers and a lot of delicious rice. We were also given warm pita on the side. It made for a delicious dinner! The chicken was delightfully charred, so juicy and flavorful. The beef was great, not chewy, and good. My favorite of the three was the ground beef one. If I were ever to come alone, I'd pick that one!"

I'm so happy you can do that at no charge!Delivery arrived a little late. Food was hot though. No problem.It arrived with a little side salad, tzatziki, a spicy green mixture, ground sumac (so cool), and a pita. A pleasant surprise! Salad was fresh and good. Both sauces good! Green one is spicy! The pita was soft. Everything was very good.The salmon itself arrived as a perfect portion size! It was flavorful, juicy, and cooked perfectly. Would 100% order it again! The grilled vegetables included tomato, red pepper, green pepper, squash, mushrooms, broccoli, zucchini, onion, and eggplant. Chargrilled to perfection! Yummmm. Perfect price point for quality, portion size, and flavor. Will be ordering here again! So good. Highly recommend. :)"
66,FVGTLWis-xBCrLmprgVXEg,6/21/2022,4 star rating,"Miraj is a restaurant that offers Persian (Iranian) cuisine. We came here for the early dinner special (4pm-6pm). Their lunch special is $14.00 and the early dinner special is $16.00. For midtown, this was a steal. The special comes with your choice of meat with basmati rice - beef kebab, chicken kebab, cornish hen kebab, vegetarian kebab, fish, and more. We opted for the beef kebab and the lamb kebab and felt that they were good choices. The two meats were moist and very juicy. The basmati rice was nice too - light and fluffy like it should be.You also get grilled vegetables, a pita, and an appetizer with the special. We chose the eggplant ratatoui and the hummus. The hummus was slightly better and went great with the pita bread. In terms of the service, the waiter did not seem too enthusiastic, but the food here is good either way."

70,YDorQeInbcXaOq_fVY0-VA,12/11/2022,3 star rating,"Ok so I used to like this place a lot but recently the decline is notable. The prices are high and the food / quality has diminished greatly. I Dont want to say that but it is my honest opinion. I took my 7 yr old son to breakfast and we ran up a 100$ bill that I normally wouldn't be upset about if it was quality and quantity that merited the price tag , not anymore. This place has unfortunately went down hill. They used to be much more generous and you can tell the CUTTING CORNERS everywhere. It's sad. Possibly not the owners fault but it's either a sign of the times or the lack of the pride anyone takes in their job / business. The service was decent , the older gentleman tried to accommodate in any way but seemed overwhelmed by other customers even though the place didn't have many."

My family and I went here for breakfast today and it was not the best experience. The staff is friendly and accommodating but the food is mediocre. I ordered scrambled eggs with bacon and it comes with potatoes and choice of toast. I started eating but then found a piece of paper in my eggs. Not sure where or what it was from but I advised the waitress right away. She brought a new platter for me which was great but like I said, it was just ok.

The problem is the Waldorf is typically a sweet salad. Raisins, apples, grapes and raspberry vinaigrette are all sweet so the chicken should be a neutral or subtle flavor. It was not. The chicken has a bbq/smoky flavor that did not go well at all with the other items in the dish. It seems like they use the same chicken for all their salads and wraps, which I totally understand, but wish they didn't. The food was fresh overall and I felt like if I ordered a different salad I would have enjoyed it better."

Located deep in Chinatown (aka, a brisk walk from the metro station), Xing Wong has some great prices for some good Chinese food. We were in a rush so we were ordering our food to go. I decided to get some crispy skin pork, because if a Chinese BBQ has bad pork, are they even a Chinese BBQ? I had to take it to go and didn't get to eat it until a couple hours later - so hopefully it would stand the test of to-go hell. Cash only, $5 for meat, rice and veggies. And soup!A couple hours later, I popped open the lid and found the crispy skin a little... uncrispy. But that's also not fair to Xing Wong since I did let it steam in the container for a couple hours. The flavor of the pork was good and I scarfed it down at the airport. I definitely would love to be back to try some other dishes. But for take out, I would definitely recommend one of their Chinese BBQ meats with rice for $5!"

The set up for the big tables is perfect, especially the lazy Susan in the center so it's easy to reach all the dishesI really enjoyed the tea, it was a highlightI wasn't as thrilled with the entrees we got. The black pepper beef was literally peppercorns, I kept biting into large balls of pepper and the duck was just too grisly for my tastes. At one point, we ordered two additional entrees and they brought out two entirely different dishesLooking at the mixed reviews, there's definitely other dishes we didn't get that people have raved about.

So I decided to order the rice bowl with beef and Chinese broccoli. The man at the register barely spoke any english, but that was okay I just pointed to what I wanted and he got it. Order was ready under 10 minutes. For a rice bowl with beef and Chinese broccoli plus a can of Sunkist it was only 6 bucks!! Take that Panda Express.

Just getting the duck itself may be the best deal since the rice and cabbage weren't anything special. The Singapore chow mei fun was great, too! Plenty of curry flavor and loaded with bean sprouts, scallions, bell pepper, ham, roast pork, and shrimp.

Bagelette unfortunately had it all, poor service, a terrible bagel, and a shop that is a complete mess.Quality: A poor bagel all around. None of the elements I look for in a quality bagel. It was extremely salty and lacking in freshness. Proportions were all off. A very flat bottom for some reason. I also was treated to a piece of plastic wrapping in the cream cheese, showing lack of care in preparation. Quantity: Smaller than usual bagel with limited cream cheese.Value: $3.00 for an Everything Bagel with Scallion Cream Cheese.Ambiance: Bagelette is a small bagel shop in the Rego Park area of Queens. Nothing about the store space is appealing. The first thing you notice is a lack of airflow as the heat from the kitchen is overwhelming. The tables all seemed messy and there was no organization to the store. When you order at the counter you are basically ordering over stacks of assorted goods.Crowd: Just a few people at the shop, most angry at the delay.Service: My bagel came out fast, but other customers were complaining about the delay in their orders. I wish they took more time with my order though, because I ended up with plastic in my cream cheese.Parking: Parking can be found in the residential area, just watch the signs."

I enjoyed a London Fog latte with the almond lemon loaf, an incredible pairing made to perfection. We sat in for a bit enjoying ourselves, and it was clear the team running the place really knew what they were doing, were familiar with their regulars, and provided friendly service to every person (and pup! there were several pups!!) who walked in their doors.

A good menu selection!! I'm giving this review 4 stars because I don't like the espresso they use.  I didn't get the name of the company, but the espresso was so bitter it was almost sour.  Also giving 4 stars because my coffee date loved their iced coffee.  I can't say this will be my new normal, but it's a great alternative to my regular spot!"

106,s87VovckLhD3jVwGFeK3UQ,12/27/2021,5 star rating,"I am a huge fan of this place. But I'll be honest, the first time I visited it was on a first date, and I didn't even go inside. I just got the coffee and we went to the park. Fast forward few months later, I just wanted to get out of my apartment in the morning and decided to come here for an Onyx latte. It was super tasty and was able to sit and read some emails before I left.They have good amount of seating inside and outside, though most people opt to take it to-go. They have doggie treats if you swing by with a dog as well.They offer ordering ahead online on Toast or you can also call and order on the phone. Staff is always amazing and super efficient. They answer all my questions and morning version of me. You guys are amazing!Overall I live 15 min walk to here and its worth the walk every time. There are days that I come by for quick grab and go coffee, and other days where I sit down and order a quick bite to eat."

111,3004g82RXwKoqaenSqBVEg,11/21/2022,4 star rating,"My favorite beer bar in the UWS. For one, it's got a legit craft beer selection. Rotating taps (and the better IPA will run out in a day or so) and lots of cans to choose from, with a nice mix of local and regional beers. A few west coast brews but these  usually take only 1-2 taps. A couple other beer bars on Amsterdam ave have a more diverse selection but not necessarily better quality. Secondly, plenty of small tables and Seating at the bar, however there is a lack of bigger tables for parties larger than 4. Still, the atmosphere is laid back without being divey. And there are several TV for you to watch sports. Third, the prices are fair and the size of the pours are 10-16 oz. A lot of NYC craft beer spots offer small pours but big prices. The food is reasonable and very decent for bar food. Try any of  the burgers! My only deduction would be service. Although they are often busy, it can be hard to get your waitress attention and we often have to wait 10 minutes for them to come around. Overall: Beer: 5/5Ambiance: 4/5Prices: 4/5Service: 3/5"

They have a variety of beers and ciders. They even had hard kombucha once which I was very excited about. And they have several solid vegetarian options. I have had the beyond meat burger as well as the Buffalo cauliflower and I enjoyed them both! Though this is claims to be a simple bar, and it aesthetically, I think that offer good food that will satisfy lots of clientele. Check it out if you're in the neighborhood and don't feel like dealing with the wait and tiki chick or Jacobs pickles;Or if you want good beer and a good bite"

The have a great beer selection but the food was only OK. I ordered the Bacon Cheddar Burger cooked medium. It came back very medium-well. Presentation was nice but taste was bland. The fries were good though!To me, the staff seemed kind of vacant. Like there, but it didn't feel liked they cared, especially the person who greeted me at the door.Back to the vibe. I don't know what it was but I didn't feel cozy here like I do at other pubs. Maybe it's just not my crowd.PS: If you're like me and use Brave browser, their online menu does not work on mobile Brave--it kept glitching while trying to scroll. It worked fine on Chrome/Safari though!"

The Diablo burger is killer and the wings are very good as well. We went back for a night cap the other day but the kitchen was closed so I decided to order the Diablo burger today. And to my surprise, the burger was excellent even delivered!  Packed very neatly, still warm and the buns weren't all that soggy like most deliveries. Glad to find a new spot we can go to chill, drink,  get good bar food and delivery."

My wife and I stopped in one evening for a pint, and were very surprised to see they carry some absolutely delicious German beer -- Franziskaner. The staff was pleasant and took our order a few minutes after sitting down and choosing. Their beer menu is displayed on multiple TVs, or via a QR code you scan with your phone's camera (I love that they do that these days). This is a fun spot if you're looking for a good time so be sure to check them out!"

160,IU-vpUugBD0AdkO7pgIOhQ,2/12/2018,4 star rating,"PROS: Authentic Guyanese-Chinese food. Had grilled shrimp fried rice and it was reminiscent of the best from Guyana. Fried plantain was a great appetizer. Decent seating for families. Excellent service; courteous wait staff (uncommon for the community/neighborhood).CONS: There are no deserts served here & the decor is standard for NYC Chinese take out restaurants. A gem of a restaurant. Straddles the line between a take out spot and family dining establishment & thankfully not another, ""bar & restaurant"" the area is known for. Will certainly return."

She said she wasn't able to do that. So we were going to order extra things then, but before we could say anything, the lady snatched the menus and just told us no repeatedly and we were essentially kicked out. It's ridiculous that we weren't even given the chance to order more. I don't know how a business is able to stay open if they keep hanging up and turning away customers"

Food *****But I must say the food was surprisingly amazing. I wasn't ready, I started eating while standing and had to grab a chair. I had the hot sauce prawn fried rice. I couldn't be more satisfied. Will go back for take out 100 % But if they work on they're customer service they would go way further."
163,IU-vpUugBD0AdkO7pgIOhQ,6/27/2016,4 star rating,"I've never had Guyanese Chinese food before and now I want to slap myself because it was SO amazing.  I went with one of my besties who comes here frequently on a random sunny Sunday. It has the typical Chinese food restaurant feel as in it looks pretty dingy but once we walked in it was crowded with people eating, laughing, watching a game and having a good time. We definitely came at the right time because we were able to order and grab our seats right before a drove of people came in for their after church lunch with their families. The one thing that threw me off is that they only accept cash which is a major inconvenience for someone like me that really only ever carries a card but I luckily had a $20 tucked away in my wallet. (Shocker)We both ended up getting the fried chicken and the shrimp fried rice with a salad on the side (hey we tried. Lol) and it was so yummy! They infuse Caribbean spices and coconut oil in their food and it really made a huge difference. They also had a server who was really sweet and encouraged people to sit down and even buy a beer to go along with your meal. I definitely will be returning here because I can't stop thinking about that rice. LOL."

I tried calling them simply to make an order for delivery, the lady was incredibly rude, and when I inquired about what is the minimum $ for delivery, she got frustrated and hung up on me and did not answer back. Here's a tip, don't hang up on your customers. They have a lot to learn."

The vegetables were just peppers and onions with 2 pieces of carrots, bokchoy and broccoli each. Didn't like this choice. I may tried another simpler meal next time."

A local favorite that I was recommended to by a Guyanese customer he said it was the best he had in New York and I may have to agree. Great service, food, quantity, and prices. Was so satisfied I had to add this business to Yelp!It's worth a detour and visit. Most customers view this place as a hidden gem. I had to share it. Let me know what y'all think."
169,IU-vpUugBD0AdkO7pgIOhQ,12/12/2019,4 star rating,Went for lunch. Ordered the chicken fried rice. The rice was very tasty and the chicken was on point. The pepper sauce can use a little more heat but good otherwise. The bathroom was clean. The staff is super friendly. Plenty of seating and comfortable for families. But cash only. They do not accept credit cards

I love their commitment to sourcing organic and healthy ingredients and incorporating them into their dishes. Their food is incredible! They have about 6 small tables to dine in. The food:Their food will leave you craving for more! Japanese bowls and Tacos, what more do you need. My sister tried the Vegan Japanese Style Curry with organic brown rice. She loved it so much. The Curry is unlike any you've ever tried, it was so flavorful and perfectly spiced. I tried the tacos! All served on organic corn tortillas. These tacos were big and full of ingredients. Fried Cod Fish Taco - lightly crispy, the fish was really delicious. The slaw added an extra crunch. This was a perfect fish taco! Sweet Yam - A nice change of a taco. The yams were perfectly soft and paired nicely with their almond mole. And the pine nuts added a nice crunchy texture. Grilled Salmon Taco - I love a good salmon taco and this is a top fav. The pineapple salsa really set it off. The citrus of lime really balanced out all of the flavors. I didn't get to try any, but I love that they serve breakfast tacos all-day! Definitely will try next time. The drinks:I tried the Japanese Matcha Beer, it's a wild mix of Japanese Rice Lager + Organic Matcha Shot. I didn't know this was a thing. I'm so glad I tried it because it was amazing!! My sister tried the Matcha Açaí Latte and loved it. Don't sleep on this spot!"
171,-fRgp3gv0-R6y9YOJX8ZVA,3/15/2023,4 star rating,Sunday brunch Tacos done right!Along with a bottle of Saratoga Sparkling water to hydrate in this heat wave of a situation we ordered:Shrimp Tacos: Freshly cooked shrimp with a couple of veggies. Nothing too fancy or unique. It required the addition of a lot of sauces on the side to enhance the flavor so probably not the most enjoyable on its own. 5/10Fried Cod Taco: Crispy interiors of the fried cod went well with the soft exterior of the taco shell. Good on flavor and good on texture. 8.5/10Chicken Mole Taco: The chicken was cooked perfectly and flavorful to the best degree. The mole flavor was present and jazzed up this taco wonderfully which could otherwise be ordinary which it wasn't at all. 10/10Chicken Mole Breakfast Taco: shaped and wrapped as a burrito and absolutely delicious. The chicken mole flavor was prominent as you'd like for it with a boost of some egg and cheese inside a soft taco exterior. This was delicious and a half. 10/10
172,-fRgp3gv0-R6y9YOJX8ZVA,3/18/2023,5 star rating,"I came to this place because I was waiting for my Yelp event to start. First to start this place definitely caught my eye because it was big and had both outdoor and indoor seating. Also it has decorative walls. When I walked inside it was a Mexican curry fusion place. I ordered the fried chicken taco. I really enjoyed this taco but it was interesting. When I ordered the taco it did not have a tortilla. When I went to eat it; I told the person she checked and then they gave me a tortilla. So in my mind it would have been best if they gave me a new taco and asked me if I wanted to keep the tortilla less taco. But nonetheless I received my tortilla and it was very good. I would definitely come back and try other items from their menu. Also in their defense it was very busy and you can see they were operating at their peak time. I do recommend this place, things happen."

It was my first time eating their food. I had the Warude Curry with extra Panko chicken. The curry sauce was delicious with the brown rice. The dish had eggplant and okra which i usually hate, but it was blended in nicely. My family had eggplant  okra and they both enjoyed it while my last bones daughter had the miso salmon and it was delicious. They did make a mistake on our order but were very apologetic when we pointed it out and gave us two free drinks for our trouble. I would definitely recommend and would go back to try more things."

The aesthetic is a bit chaotic, but it works for this establishment. The seating was adequate, the meals quickly prepared and full of flavor. I ordered 3 tacos (Fried fish, fried chicken, and shrimp), chicken ramen, and cold unfiltered Sake. Smashed all of it. The chicken taco was my favorite bite, but the ramen was a close contender. I'm a tonkatsu ramen Stan, but the lack of pork on the menu meant nothing when I was scarfing down delicious tacos and noodles.  Will definitely come back when I'm in the 'Stuy."

Recently, I got to experience the greatness, in person. I loved the shrimp tacos, the teriyaki chicken and shrimp and zucchini bowls, and the breakfast tacos. The outdoor dining is a vibe. Nice way to people watch and take Tompkins Ave. all in. Can't wait to go again. It was a perfect stop to get lunch on a Saturday afternoon."
176,-fRgp3gv0-R6y9YOJX8ZVA,11/15/2022,4 star rating,Really vibrant shop with good music and most importantly delicious food! Lunch rush was busy here but didn't really have to wait too long to grab a table and order without calling ahead. Be warned though as they might run out of items you want to try so just keep that in mind if you're coming to try something specific. I ended up ordering one fried cod fish and one fried chicken taco and both were delicious! Nice portion sizes and perfectly crisp protein to hold the toppings. I felt full without the meal feeling too heavy so if you're hungry why not go for three! I like that they also have some options if you prefer to go vegetarian or vegan without having to sacrifice taste.
177,-fRgp3gv0-R6y9YOJX8ZVA,6/9/2022,2 star rating,"Dry, flavorless, and undressed salad. Need I say more ?I'll start with the positive. The food was packaged well, with the curry separate from the chicken so it wouldn't be soggy. However the chicken on its own was beyond dry, almost like cardboard with zero seasoning. The salmon miso was also dry and over cooked. The side salad was not dressed and had no dressing included. It was simply chopped kale. I also ordered the teriyaki chicken, which had a brush of sauce and mound of rice. The best thing I ate was the curry sauce but even that was very sweet. Not what I expected at all. I picked this place off the pictures and reviews online and sadly it did not live up to my expectations."

The combination of string lights, outdoor seating and park views makes it hard to pass up on especially if the weather is nice. As much as I enjoy shake shack, I am still on the search for burgers in the city. If you think you've found the one, do share. Happy burger hunting."

This is not my first time having Shack Shack. I first tried Shake Shack in Houston. To me it was just another fast food burger. I like the fact that there are chairs and tables in Madison Park (where it is located). I can see it to be a popular place to grab food in the summer time. In the winter time, its kind of cold to eat outside. Anyways back to the burger. The ingredients were fresh. Like I said, nothing really stood out from the burger. They don't use a tradition plain bun like other restaurants. I believe they use potato bun. I do like potato buns. It is definitely a place to get a quick bite.It is located near a train station in Madison Park. The place is easy to get to."
209,FEVQpbOPOwAPNIgO7D3xxw,4/10/2022,4 star rating,"Honestly, it's nice to know even after expanding, the OG location still slaps (I am so sorry)This location is one of my favorites due to the fact you can take your order and people watch in the park. It always has its starry lights on which makes it bit more magical than the other locations. But I digress. On this day, we ended up ordering a buffalo chicken sandwich with some cheesy fries. Chicken sandwich had the right amount of sauce and tang and came with a decent sized piece of chicken. The fries were a bit crisp but wonderfully overpowered by the cheese sauce. The drinks themselves were good too, some sort of citrus lemonade, which wasn't too sweet. Overall though, probably one of my favorite chains out there. Their new items are always as good as their standards. And years later, it seems like the quality hasn't slacked in the slightest!"

And where else can you find fried gizzards in this town.Listen they're closer to a 4 star rating, and it's not the cleanest place, but they deserve a better rating then they got on here. Coming from a Chinese dude, this place is really solid"

Got the general tso's dinner combo which came to around $9. There are three other Chinese places right around the corner that I know of and they all have better food so go to those.

I ordered the sesame chicken with fried rice and was more than happy with the taste, as well as the quantity of food I was given. For less than ten dollars you are given enough food to last you two nights. I would certainly go to Mei Jung Mei when looking for an affordable, and flavorful meal."

So, this is a take out place.Food: It's okay, depending on what you get, when I order from here I stick to French fries and chicken wings or something equally simple to make. I tried ordering General Tso's from here and it tasted like Orange Chicken threw up in my mouth.Service: Oh, the guy yelling at you through the glass? Never mind him, he's always cranky."

They need to paint and get some new trash cans. It doesn't seem as if it's well-kept between seated diners. Tables weren't wiped down and the floor wasn't swept. Despite the A that they proudly display, I won't be coming back unless I see those changes."

The menu is huge, yet they can quickly conjure up any order with aplomb and dispatch it post haste.Absolutely everyone in our group enjoyed their entrees. Sitting outside at one of their large tables, we marveled at how quiet the street was. In addition to providing excellent service with a friendly demeanor, the staff was exceptionally conscientious: About five minutes after we left, I discovered I'd left an expensive tripod behind. I ran back and they recognized me immediately.  Rather than take chances, they'd already taken it inside for safekeeping, so one of them went in to retrieve and return it to me. In summary: A great experience overalll we're definitely going to visit it again soon."

Hot and sour soup is on point. Great lunch special prices that's hard to beat! I was craving for chicken wings and it's as good as the ones my mom makes, crispy on the outside, flavorful in the inside. Another one of my favorite is their eggplant in garlic sauce with white rice (white rice because the sauce mixes very well with it). My next go to is their shrimp with garlic sauce where shrimps are not over cooked and tender ."

The gravy was yellow instead of brown with no taste. General Tsao' chicken was dry. The bone-in spare ribs looked and tasted reheated. The only item that was tasty was the pork fried rice.

Maybe 3'other customers there while we were there. The location itself is nice but extremely outdated. Looked straight out of the 90s.We were greeted and sat quite quickly (I should hope so with no one else really there). The service was ok, nothing extraordinary but good none the less. The food was good, our only complaint is they literally put shrimp in everything and we (my husband and I) are allergic to shrimp. But everything else was delicious! The review was 3 stars mainly for the outdatedness of the location but other than that I would return to this location again!"

I'd definitely avoid prime time like dismissal on school days -- packed with middle/high schoolers. Use cash if you don't want to be charged a credit fee. I ordered a large earl gray milk tea with tapioca and came out a little over $7 using my cc. To be honest, it was waaay too sweet for my liking. Wish I was able to customize the sweetness level. Would prob come back for fruit drinks."
238,9MSvj1NSKlWZKNA3aQaJOQ,10/2/2022,3 star rating,"They have a nice selection of boba and teas. Their milk tea selection is not as big but has staples. However they have a lot of different refreshers, smoothies, and even has combos with the Japanese sushi and takoyaki hot foods right next to it. For 7.00 you can get a huge bubble tea. However pictured is their medium Taro Almond Smoothie which was perfect. Wished they had different milk options however this was still perfect not too sweet and that kick of taro."

241,9MSvj1NSKlWZKNA3aQaJOQ,5/9/2022,4 star rating,Hole in the wall establishment that serves what I like to call fast food sushi. Ordered jasmine iced tea and had the spicy tuna roll and eel roll. Came out fast enough jasmine tea tasted great and the sushi was what you would expect from a place like this. They also offer fish balls and chicken nuggets. Overall a no frills spot for when you want to grab some quick sushi and some bubble tea on the go.

My friend and I walked over during my break and placed an order for Ice Milk Tea with Tapioca, Fresh Mango Yakult, Salt & Pepper Chicken, French Fries, and a Spicy Kani Roll. The Fresh Mango Yakult was extremely refreshing. I tasted the fresh mango with each sip. The Salt & Pepper Chicken was crispy and seasoned perfectly. Not too much salt or pepper, but just enough to keep you coming back for more. I wasn't a fan of the fries because they were crinkle and not off the shoestring variety. Although they were crispy I couldn't enjoy them. I didn't get a chance to try the sushi because I was already full. However, my friend said that the Spicy Kani wasn't bad but we've had better. The rice was mushy and there was too much of it. However she did enjoy the spicy Mayo and eel sauce drizzled on top. This place was way too hot to not have the portable ac unit on. I wanted to turn on the ac because it made no sense for it to feel like a scorching hot summer day. We had to wait outside as our food cooked."

With that being said I always get the large whenever I get boba, no matter where I go.That seems to be where I went wrong with Anda cafe. Their large is literally in a quart size container with a straw in it. Imagine my face when they called my order number. Too much of a good thing can be bad for you, but too much of a meh drink is also not great. There was a promo though, 2 larges for $9 which is a steal. Get it to shock your friends, but not if you're craving really good boba."

The wonderful, original, cheap ethnic places disappear and are rapidly replaced with generic airspace chain cafés; white boxes with grey oak floors and lots of fiddle ferns all selling the same bland bake-off or commissary products at sky high prices.Well, Café Riviera is thankfully still here and still going strong. The place is a immaculate with beautiful sweet young girls behind the counters and a tough no nonsense lady running the place. This is a European style café where you relax and have conversation over pastry and great coffee. No annoying ear bud tune-outs hogging tables with laptops trying to look employed. All the baking here is done on premises, French Patisserie quality and superb. Standouts are the crisp cheese and fruit filled danish, the cheese cakes, traditional buttery croissants, crème brûlée cakes, pies and of course the babkas and assorted Polish cookies ( chocolate, poppy, linzer). I am not kidding, prices here are less than half what all those crummy New Brooklyn cafés now charge. I stop here on the way to The City and bring cookies and cakes for our office parties. My employees are very pleased and ask ""where did you get this?""Don't be a New Brooklyn Gentrifying tool. Support these independently owned old Brooklyn Ethnic neighborhood places before they are all gone."

I love purchasing almost all the baked goods here. The macaroons are a must, and the Polish cheesecake is delicious so are the croissants and danishes, poppy seed roll is so yummy. The cappuccino was tasty. The inside is a bit tight, but those visiting don't seem to mind and find a way to maneuver between those that are sitting and those awaiting their order.My suggestion to the owner is to SMILE and say hello to your guests, you don't need to know me to greet me with a simple hello and a smile."

I had a double margarita that was delicious and put me out of commission for about an hour. And of course, there are Jell-O shots.I will definitely stop by again when I'm in NYC, and if anyone is every in Miami Beach, FL, you should stop by the sister location of Bob's Your Uncle.

The generous amount of cheese, the homemade-tasting sauce and the crust you can fold over...but the last several times I ordered a pie, the dough has a strange taste..almost the taste of cleaning solution they may be using on the counters or in the 'fridge where the dough is kept. Maybe it is the boxes absorbing some kind of taste. I am dying to order a pie - I did one last time, months ago, hoping the problem would be gone, but it wasn't. I wonder if it is some kind of cleaning agent used because of this Wuhan situation or maybe I am wrong, and it is some kind of damp, moldy place where the boxes are stored. I hope no offense is taken - I love the guys who work there. They are so warm and friendly on the phone and I would love nothing more than to continue supporting my local pizza restaurant with my business!"

And they have a good amount of people eating here for lunch or having dinner. After my hubby raved about this place(since he gets lunch here when working in the area) he finally bought me here during lunch one day. Staff is friendly and we manged to get a good seat. Ordered a chicken roll(to share) and some slices of pizza. They were nice enough to bring it to our table and we enjoyed our lunch with some cream sodas. The sauce they have is really good. It doesn't have an overpowering taste and goes great on anything. The pizza is nice and thin, not too thin that it's too crunchy but enough not to be doughy...you get me? Well if you do or don't you must try it for yourself. The chicken roll was good, i was actually thinking of not sharing my piece. On the next trip to SI I will make sure to order my own. I saw some tables with pasta, and they were really enjoying it. So maybe next time we'll pick some up and give them a try. Overall, good food and good service so we will be returning."

The staff were very friendly and were nice enough to give my gf and I extra sauce. The lamb shawarma gyro was absolutely fantastic. Seasoning on point and the meat itself was juicy. The pita bread admittedly could be a little better but overall for the price and for what you get it's definitely great bang for the buck.
278,XCpvVDi-eMDid3s6LrDIuw,3/14/2023,5 star rating,We loved this place! Tiny little store but huge flavors. Falafel is some of the best I've had and I fell in love with falafel in the Middle East!!!

282,XCpvVDi-eMDid3s6LrDIuw,6/30/2021,4 star rating,"Yum! The falafel is perfectly crisp on the outside, and so warm and dense on the inside. The tomatoes and cucumbers were fresh, and the spicy sauce REALLY gave it a kick! The service was really friendly and fast. It only took a couple of minutes to order and start enjoying my sandwich. The sandwiches are sort of small, so if you're looking to really fuel up, I'd get two. I was surprised that the hummus sandwich also goes for $7, because without the falafel, or some form of meat, I can't imagine the sandwich would be very substantial at all. Overall, a great place for an afternoon snack or a light lunch!"

284,XCpvVDi-eMDid3s6LrDIuw,9/15/2021,2 star rating,This place was disappointing from order through the meal itself.  I ordered through their website and was informed it would take 90 minutes before it was ready for pickup. What??? I called and was immediately hung up on. I then called again and the person could not communicate when food would be ready. I then went about 30 minutes in and saw that the order has been sitting out for a while. The food itself (falafel sandwich and fries) was also disappointing. Not very flavorful and limp and left my stomach hurting as a lasting present. Pass.

But hey, they're next door to an appointment I was going to and I was early so I figured let me get a cool drink on a muggy day. They were packed, which okay great for business! The girl at the register took my order and everything looked correct so I paid and went to the waiting area with everyone else for my drink. Two people ahead of me were given hot drinks that were supposed to be iced - the barista who made them rolled her eyes both times and fixed the drinks. I knew I was in trouble since my request was iced, as well. Sure enough, same barista calls my name and it's a hot drink. I politely inform her it's supposed to be iced and she rolls her eyes, motions for one minute, and goes back to making other drinks.I waited...And waited...And waited 25 minutes. I should have spoke up sooner, however, I was both annoyed and amused that this employee could not rectify my situation during the span of half an hour. My appointment next door was coming up so after being unable to get anyone's attention I left, called my bank, and disputed the charge. Call me a Karen - I really don't care. That was $6 for a drink I already find to be overpriced and overrated! Lots of people were frustrated and tons of orders were incorrect. It explains the low rating at this location."

I've tried both: -Order in person - approximately 10 mins wait-Mobile order - less than 5 mins (2x it's been waiting for me).I think it also depends on what you ordered - specialty drinks & fraps- add 2 mins... regular coffee - no wait at all.Overall, the Starbucks team here is pretty good & efficient.

Was very much look forward to it, but everything was a bit flawed....I ordered one martini and woke up with a huge hangover. This is very odd for me, so I can only assume it was cheap vodka, which explains the $9 pricetag.  I ordered salmon (a go-to when out) and I could not eat it. It was so so so so salty!!! I took it home and ""cleaned"" it for next day leftovers which helped a bit.  That brings me to the worst offense...leftovers! My husband ordered a veal entree, but we were full from appetizers and he decided to take it home even though he liked it (but since i wasn't eating the salmon, we just decided that the meal was over). Well, next day, turns out that they did not put in his veal leftover. It was literally the entire $40 plate!!! We called the next day, spoke with someone and they said they would get right back to us.... days later and no call.I understand if restaurants are busy,  but to not wrap up our leftovers and give it to us and then not even call back is horrible customer service. I really wanted to like this place....and I could deal with ordering only top-shelf and saying ""no salt"" in the future...but I cant support such poor customer service :("

The salads were small, but tasty. We then waited about 35 minutes for our entrees. I ordered a pasta dish but the waitress never asked if I wanted Parmesan cheese, and I didn't ask for it. We had to get the attention of a busboy to get our water refilled. After the table was cleared, the waitress asked if we wanted coffee, but she didn't ask if we wanted dessert or presented a dessert menu. By now, we just wanted to leave and it took about 15 minutes to get the check.

Loved the piano player, he really contributed to the atmosphere in a positive way.Cocktails were good, the Cosmo was probably one of the best I've had.For apps we had baked clams & stuffed zucchini flowers. The clams were tender & flavorful. My husband really enjoyed the zucchini flowers, I thought they were good but a little too oily.For entrees, I had chicken parm with spaghetti (my go to in any Italian restaurant I've never been to before) and I thought it was fantastic. (So now next time I will be more adventurous lol) The chicken was tender and both the chicken and the sauce were well seasoned. The portions are generous, so I ended up taking some home and it did not go to waste!Tom had the Seafood Combo (fra diavolo), which he said was delicious - no doggie bag there!Unfortunately we didn't have room for dessert, maybe next time.A new favorite...we'll definitely be back soon!"

All the cashiers are always pretty nice, a tourist accidentally cut me in line today and the cashier took me first, graciously explaining that I'd been there first. I didn't mind in the slightest, but it was a nice touch for him to explain. Hot food bar has some reliable staples, the plantains are solid when fresh (they get rock hard when sitting for too long), the chicken (very unspecific I know but I don't know how else to describe it? Rotisserie? They come in drum sticks and thigh pieces), the pink cream pasta, the fried fish. Fried fish is super good actually lol Idk if it's just me. The general Yao's chicken is super dry over time but still edible. Would recommend you skip if you have a sensitive stomach though, I can it being hard enough that digestion might suck. Expect deli food and you'll be alright! The seating is a nice addition too for when you're just trying to get food into your mouth as fast as humanly possible. Pssst, they stock the hot food at 10 AM"

Here's what I had: a pork dumpling, sautéed string beans, vegetable chew fun, and sesame chicken. Pork dumpling--pretty good, but there was so much dough. Sautéed string beans--solid. It wasn't very heavily sautéed so the flavor wasn't all there, but they were still decent. Vegetable chew fun--good. Not much to say here. Sesame chicken--eh. The sauce was tasty but the chicken itself was kind of dry. It also cooled down really quickly so it was kind of cold once I ate it. Overall, I'd say this place is just ok, at least based on what I had."

While it's not difficult to find similar market places and salad bars in NYC, you rarely find one with the prices and variability that is found here.More often than not, I come here for their salads. There is a salad bar near the back area where you can pick your greens and 6 toppings. It's relatively cheap for NYC prices, under $10 for a salad. There's a variety of proteins to choose from as well as other toppings and dressings. The staff, especially the cashier woman, and the salad bar employees, are very friendly. They even remember how I like my salad over time.If you're not up for a salad, they have plenty of other options as well. There's a cold and hot food section where you can build your own platter, and it's paid by weight. In other areas, there is also a sandwich station, a pasta station, a bibimbap (Korean stone pot rice) section, and a ramen/udon section. There is plenty to choose from and will most likely be able to satisfy most palettes out there."

I received my order and as I'm pulling out cash to pay the lady with the disgusting attitude behind the desk reached over and tried to grab the money out my hand. At this moment I'm shocked and I looked around to see if that really happened.I calmly but sternly told the woman never to reach to grab money out my hand. She tired to over talk with a fake apology but I wasn't having. I walked out and never returned again. Go to Arome Cafe which is right across the street. Must better service!

I was first disappointed a few weeks ago when I got a sandwich containing salami and when I opened up my sandwich to check it the salami was old and brown around the edges. I was disGusted but gave them another chance. Today I am officially done with Moncher Market. I purchased a wrap today which was good but I also usually end up getting a pack of plain m&m every time I go as well. Although it is just candy I could taste how old they were upon further investigation it stated the candy was better before 2018! Why is it that 2 years later that is still on the shelf. What makes me even more upset is that when I confronted one of the owners about it she printed like she didn't t know English. So please  check your food beFore you leave people and check all the expiration dates on anything you buy here

In my head maybe something happened it just ONE PIECE. Then I keep drinking and now it taste a lot more grainy then usual. Felt the same sensation again another piece then another and another. Now I'm back at work and I was about to throw it away because the last thing that needs to happen is me to get sick (I was already half way done by the time I got inside) so I decided to pour the rest down the sink.

I was underwhelmed with the service and at the end of the day, when going into a smoothie chain, that's about all that can be rated since the smoothie recipes are set and taste great.I walked in at 8:20pm and there were no on-going orders. There were 2 employees on shift. After ordering, they stated they ran out of pomegranate powder (which is understandable to some extent, but it should be said at the point of ordering and they should know when they run out of stock). I quickly substituted for another drink. After ordering and paying, about 2-3 minutes pass by and 1 employee is doing something in the back (presumably cleaning) and the other is cleaning the area up (but visibly not working on my order when there is clearly enough room and space to make my drink). For a $15 smoothie, I expect better service. I say something along the lines.. ""I ordered a blue magic"" and receive an indifferent response of ""I'm cleaning.""Better service would equate to.. ""I will get to your drink in a moment"" or some vigor in her movements to show that she was trying to prioritize my time. Clearly she was thinking about saving her own time and getting of the shift quicker when the other employee was already cleaning and could step in and help. Food is a service industry and part of what I'm paying for.I'd avoid this location if you're in a rush and who in NYC besides tourists has time to meander around waiting for staff that is not focused on you."

Walked in to the tiny space and went right to the back (in order to look at the menu I would have had to stand basically up against the three people waiting for their orders, which seemed uncomfortable).

When I went to pay, I asked if they had chopsticks (no), so I ended up having to eat my sushi with a spoon. Noticed that my entire package of sushi was leaking, so I asked if I could grab another. They said sure, then went and put the leaking one back (so now someone else gets sushi mess all over them? Come on). Asked for a receipt and did not get one.

Went in yesterday while I was working an event because I needed something quick and pre-prepared and most food places in the area are sit down restaurants. Walked in to the tiny space and went right to the back (in order to look at the menu I would have had to stand basically up against the three people waiting for their orders, which seemed uncomfortable). The fridges were dark and made it hard to read labels from anything inside. Picked up a box of vegetable sushi and ""pico de quinoa."" When I went to pay, I asked if they had chopsticks (no), so I ended up having to eat my sushi with a spoon. Noticed that my entire package of sushi was leaking, so I asked if I could grab another. They said sure, then went and put the leaking one back (so now someone else gets sushi mess all over them? Come on). Asked for a receipt and did not get one. Had to remind them despite having just said it. Also was asked to sign a receipt and not even given a pen. All seemingly insignificant things but when it's one after the other, it really makes you wonder what they are doing there?The sushi itself was awful. It almost felt frozen and the pieces were way too big and awkwardly  shaped to eat. The taste itself was not something I enjoyed at all.

I love how they don't skimp on quality ingredients and every time I drink a smoothie or eat something from Juice Press it is like food purity. I believe in their products so much. But please Juice Press people in charge: i think y'all need to treat employees better or pay them better or something: because your employees are definitely not a representation of how quality your food is and I wish that you treat people who work for your company the same way you treat your ingredients and your products: you're making such quality items but clearly something is missing in your human-to-human exchanges. Walking into the store, it wreaked of bleach. Counter-person was on their cell phone. A lot of missing items from the fridge (I came in for the raw ravioli -- there were only a couple of items in the fridge -- that's wonderful if y'all sold out! there was a really depleted and ""please don't come here"" energy and i couldn't wait to get out.) Maybe it's a matter of making fewer things and treating people better so that the people you hire can treat your customers better -- I would hate for people to turn away from Juice Press because of customer service when your product is so clearly the best in the game: juice generation and pressed juicery are nowhere close to the incredible medicine and nourishment you offer! I think your food could be even more healing if the business healed itself too. Sometimes I worry that the power-hunger I can feel from Juice Press higher-ups seeps through and the people they are hiring aren't being treated well. With love. A diehard customer and fan."

Today on the other hand was not so great I ordered the Fountain of youth 20 minutes before my lunch break was over. As I'm walking with drink to go back to work as I'm sipping I felt something awkward in my mouth at first I thought it was just a piece of fruit that didn't blend all the way so I took at my mouth and it was tape. In my head maybe something happened it just ONE PIECE. Then I keep drinking and now it taste a lot more grainy then usual. Felt the same sensation again another piece then another and another. Now I'm back at work and I was about to throw it away because the last thing that needs to happen is me to get sick (I was already half way done by the time I got inside) so I decided to pour the rest down the sink. So I just wanted to see how much tape was left before I completely flush it down the drain and I found more blue tape.Just an update no one actually contacted me.

I was underwhelmed with the service and at the end of the day, when going into a smoothie chain, that's about all that can be rated since the smoothie recipes are set and taste great.I walked in at 8:20pm and there were no on-going orders. There were 2 employees on shift. After ordering, they stated they ran out of pomegranate powder (which is understandable to some extent, but it should be said at the point of ordering and they should know when they run out of stock). I quickly substituted for another drink. After ordering and paying, about 2-3 minutes pass by and 1 employee is doing something in the back (presumably cleaning) and the other is cleaning the area up (but visibly not working on my order when there is clearly enough room and space to make my drink). For a $15 smoothie, I expect better service. I say something along the lines.. ""I ordered a blue magic"" and receive an indifferent response of ""I'm cleaning.""Better service would equate to.. ""I will get to your drink in a moment"" or some vigor in her movements to show that she was trying to prioritize my time. Clearly she was thinking about saving her own time and getting of the shift quicker when the other employee was already cleaning and could step in and help.

It was a little bit on the smaller side, but tasted pretty good still. We also got the scallion pancakes with beef which were also really good. They also have a few alcohol options like beer and wine for pretty cheap. A carafe of sake is $8 here. The also have a beer happy hour that's not easy to make (believe it ends at 6) with $3 beers, but the rest of the stuff is still reasonably priced without the happy hour.

The sauce container was inside the dumpling to-go box, but the dumplings were so hot the steam melted the plastic of the sauce container, which went everywhere. I recommend asking for the sauce outside of the dumpling container! It seems a bit toxic to have the plastic melt in the dumpling container.

The staff is always nice and they actually pick up the phone!The restaurant itself is okay. It has the décor of a fast food joint more than an actual restaurant, but it is more or less clean. There is always good (African) music and it's never too busy. I've always found a place to seat and I've come at all hours of the day or night. Oh yeah, it's open 24/7! Isn't that amazing?? Prices are slightly higher than other African places in the area; the average meal is about $15. Overall I would recommend this place if your priority is the food.

This is a small hole in the wall restaurant, there are a few tables to sit and eat in. There were a group of African men chatting & eating while others were waiting for their orders while parked in front. My order was to go, and it was ready in 10 mins. I ordered the grilled while fish. The fish here was basted with a sauce on the grill so it's recieved wet and moist, like a BBQ & it comes with a side of onion & tomato in oil, which I didn't much care for at all. It's a boney fish with flavorful skin, it's not spicy but comes with a spicy sauce on the side which I enjoyed. I ordered a attieke & sweet plantain to go with. The attieke is a grated cassava dish which was served plain, flavorless with a Maggie cube in the center & the plantains were fried. I found both the sides to be disappointing. I didn't enjoy eating the fish without a side, the flavorless oily onion & tomato sauce doesn't go well with a moist fish, and it didn't pair well with attieke or the already oily fried plantains. I wasn't sure what to do with the Maggie cube, I crumbled it on the attieke to give it flavor but it was too salty. I washed the meal down with a bissap drink with cost $4 & was very sweet. The total meal for nearly $40 & needless to say, this experience was not enjoyable for me. I believe in supporting minority family owned local businesses, and I do hope to maybe come back and try another dish from their menu that perhaps will be more to my taste. Happy Yelping!"

The portions were generous - we had to have several take home containers (plan accordingly). Most of all, our West African guest clearly gave a 4-star approval of the meal.

Egg component of the sandwich had various vegetables in it as well which was surprisingly delightful. The cabbage was thinly sliced so it does not feel too difficult to bite through. There was ketchup in the toast as well to bring it altogether. I also ordered a kbbq burger which was so so so flavorful. The seasoning and marinade for the meat patty tasted like kbbq marinated bulgogi. It has a soy based and tasted sweet and savory. Definitely would order this again in the future."

The Korean Style Toast was eggy, slightly sweet and the different ingredients complimented each other well. The BLT had a nice meaty flavor and the bacon was not overly crunchy, which made for easy bites. They both have a lot of vegetables and the bread isn't overwhelming. I'm normally someone who eats sandwiches open faced because I get overwhelmed by bread, but I didn't need to do that here because the bread was thin and perfectly toasted.We definitely suggest coming here for a delicious breakfast!

The burger was neatly wrapped in wax paper and placed in a paper container. I was afraid since it was ""bulgogi"" that it would be sweet but it had a hint of sweetness but you really got that korean bbq flavor with grilled onions. Accompanied by ketchup and korean mayo eith a slice of fresh tomato and crisp lettuce. It can be a bit rich so they give you a little container of soury jalapeños, just what I need to cut through the greasiness. It was still hot by the time I got home and I devoured it.

The place is nice but a little dim on the inside even during the day. I order chai bubble tea & it was $6, & it didn't even taste like chai but more like artificial chocolate smoothie. The Korean lady who served me spoked broken English and gave me an attitude. She was very nice to the Korean customer before me, but changed her face and tone when she spoked to me. Complete racism! I got into a car accident by the block as well, and showed her the police report for a request for camera access. She dismissed my paperwork like it was nothing! A fuckin inhumane person! I will take the rejection as the camera access was a little more private but her reaction to my case was absolutely disgusting and awful attitude towards serving food to those who are non-Korean! Please adjust your attitude B*TCH!"

They have a live DJ at night and the staff is super friendly! The menu is pretty good for what it is. I ordered the pork buns, fries, beef sliders, and croquettas. Everything came out hot and the presentation was beautiful! The beef sliders definitely needed something acidic like kimchi or scallion salad. Also, they have a happy hour menu, but the food is priced the same as the normal menu which was a little odd lol. Hookahs are $45 each. Also, they were giving very generous samples of their new cocktails when I went. You will definitely have a great time here!Fyi, they charge 20% gratuity automatically, so remember not to double tip!"

I have never had such an awful experience when paying for bottle service. It is no wonder why it is EMPTY on a Friday night. If you want to be spoken to condescendingly, have people in your party turned away for ridiculous reasons (the bouncer ""didn't like"" the way someone took their ID back), and be in a lounge where people aren't even dancing then this is the perfect place for you. And the dress code on their website is different than the one posted at the door."

Inside the place is spacious and nice, I can see how it could be a fun time on the dance floor on other nights. There wasn't anyone dancing by the time I left around 1230 or so maybe like three people. Staff is friendly, very good service.  Food was probably the best part of the night: we got the tuna tartare, sliders, fries, croquetas, and spring rolls. And mango guacamole with taro chips. Definitely worth every bite. Hookah was average price $45, very smooth so I would say hookah was good too.Drinks however are super pricy (I guess average for NY).  9 patron shots were $144. Passion fruit Paloma tasted the best, my friend and I tried ordering a regular Paloma but it was not a Paloma and tasted super floral-y.Overall - good experience, just be careful how many drinks you order. If I were to come back, it would be for food/music/hookah."

The beef sliders amazing & the ceaser salad 10/10 the steak tacos were ok compared to everything else but still good!  The bartender was so attentive and so sweet. The hookah lasted us the entire almost 4 hrs we were there only needing to change the charcoal once was worth the price!DJ was playing all the hits. We had a great time & will definitely be back!

The reviews on Yelp show some older pics of the space but it has been renovated & looks great! We were excited to dine at this cute space. The restaurant is very modern, with an open concept, lots of greenery & plenty dim lighting. It was pretty empty with just one other table dining & two people at the bar. The restaurant was participating in NYC restaurant week so we decided to try out that menu. We ordered cocktails, the Mora Mora & Mi Corazon which were tasty. For staters, the Asian Spice Guacamole and COCHINITA STEAMED BUNS which were decent. The menu is designed for people to share so the entrees seem somewhat incomplete. We both ordered the Arroz Frito w/ shrimp. The rice was not flavorful & the shrimp taste like it was just pulled from the ocean and fried as is. Shrimp were unseasoned & fishy. The desert that came with the prefix was a slice of shortcake w/ a rolled wafer and a macaroon. The cake taste refrigerated. The place has potential but we didn't love it. The drinks were good but service was surprisingly slow while the place was empty. May return when things pickup."

The space is cool. The music is good. The drinks aren't anything super creative but it's not intended to be that kind of place and I appreciate that. What they do, they do well.

This cool speakeasy is hidden behind a barbershop and opens up to an expansive back room. I liked the dim lighting and the look of the place. The bartenders were efficient and made me an excellent Strawberry Fields cocktail. It was easy to find seating but definitely got a lot more packed around 1130pm."

As you may imagine, it's behind the barber shop so you enter through there.We were greeted by 2 lively hosts and were stamped and let in. It was super crowded but we jetted to the bar as quickly as we could. Asked for a tequila drink and a rum drink - bartenders choice - and both were yummy!Music was mostly 90s and 00s r&b and pop throwbacks which we loved! A lot of drunk, young annoying people there too but didn't bother us much when they weren't spilling drinks.I'd go back but not top of the list"

The guy at the door grossly complimented my friends toes which made her uncomfortable. The inside was packed and playing throwback music that takes you back to freshman year of college--it was ok, drinks overpriced.Anyways, I always hold my phone in my hand when I go out, but this time I put my phone in my pocketbook--zipped--around my shoulder. Not only was it stolen, with all of my cards in the back, but so was my best friend's cellphone and her cards, and EIGHT other phones?!!? Eight. That is seriously ridiculous!!No one at the front was willing to help us retrieve these items, despite multiple people being seriously distraught from their items being stolen. I asked if this happens often and they replied ""idk i dont think so"" that was all. My phone updated my location to a couple blocks away and now it seems it has been sold to a retail store upstate... wtf.I spent the whole weekend regathering my life together-- I called Blind Barber to ask them to look at their footage, the woman on the phone declined and said she did not have authority to do that. When I emailed Mark at the bar, he replied that ""their footage was not working that night for some reason"" and just told me to file a police report. The whole thing feels extremely calculated and SUS.If you want to keep your belongings and have a fun-filled stress-free night do NOT go here."
482,hRQ4Jwqr4ixUMokpPoob-w,12/20/2022,1 star rating,Absolutely terrible. A female bartender/employee here shoved my friend out of the way very aggressively with her elbow and cussed at my friend afterwards. It didn't help that my group of friends were the only women of color in the bar and the worker was a white woman. I understand pushing people out of the way a little but the employee was incredibly rude and unprofessional to my friend. Her actions were disgusting. Don't come here unless you like being pushed and cussed at by employees!

Yes, this is precisely what happened because I told the worker I didn't appreciate his consistently rude attitude. This is of course the short version but I felt compelled to let the public know since management didn't seem to care. As to the food itself, highly overpriced. Sometimes we as consumers need to be realistic as to what we're paying for. Don't take my word for it; start by ordering in person at the take out section in the back of the restaurant and see for yourself if these individuals have any sort of pride or respect for your hard earned money you spend. That is just as important to me as the quality and value I pay for."

I had chicken legs with couscous and vegetable, Mommy had a chicken kebab, and Hubby had Angel hair pasta with chicken and mushroom. I liked my chicken better than a kebab. Even Mommy liked my dish better too. Hubby's dish was ot, it's not Italian style cooking. The taste of the pasta was very different. The eggplant dip was one of the best!"

Clear winners were the tender baby chicken kabob, the super flavorful and juicy minced beef kabob and the addictive housemade hummus with sauteed onions and mushrooms generously seasoned with shawarma seasoning. The schnitzel had a nice crunchy bite to it and their cold salads were spot on too! Loved the tumeric laced pickled cabbage. Will definitely be back!"

The cooks behind the counter, literally breathing over all the multitude of salads they serve to their guests, maskless. Mask wearing is not enforced by its employees OR to its guests - many of whom were traipsing all around the restaurant maskless. It is literally a Petri dish and every night dining there, a potential super spreader. I felt like I walked into 2018. It's a shame. We'll never get the virus under control with establishments and mindsets like this and it just ruins it for the other restaurants trying to stay open and follow rules. SHAME SHAME SHAME. They had to unfortunately be reported to 311 and I would encourage others who dare to go and expose themselves to the Rona also call 311 and report them if this behavior continues."

One of the people in our party never got her main dish and we were waiting an hour and a half .  Food was mediocre at best. There must be better kosher places in Queens.  We came from Manhattan and our friends came from Lawrence, so we were meeting half way.  Granted we are both spoiled to good choices, but we were paying good prices for ""fine dining"" and not getting what we were paying for.We wont be back"

Given that we're in a pandemic and I didn't feel like all the precautions were taken, I'd probably rate it 3.5 if that weren't the case."

We were greeted right away as we entered and our server was on top of things. He refilled our waters quickly and was always nearby if we needed something. They also gave us some dessert since we were there for a special occasion and helped us take some great photos.Food- most of us ordered the lunch special for our entree, which is such a great deal! I got the $15 chicken marsala dish, which came with a choice of 1 side (white rice, yellow rice, rosemary potatoes, or string beans & carrots).  The food was plentiful as I was able to save a portion for lunch the next day.  The chicken was super tender and flavorful. The sauce was a bit watery/light, but I enjoyed the dish overall. For appetizers, we got a mix of their 5 salads. SO DELICIOUS. I highly recommend it. The baba ganoush is great!Their menu (all on an iPad) is quite diverse, with a little something for everyone. Worth a visit if you're in the area or if you're looking for a decent kosher restaurant."

We ordered 8 appetizers and everyone ordered a main dish and there was tons of food leftover. Seriously, these portions are huge and the food is quite tasty too! The staff was friendly and helpful and service was prompt. The only downside was that there was a long wait for the ladies room. As far as the food goes I'd highly recommend the hummus with chicken, cigars, falafel, and chicken fingers from the appetizers. The Yemenite soup is a rich hearty soup with plenty of meat and potatoes. As far as the mains go the kebabs are all great and I love getting the pepper steak on a sizzling plate. It makes such an impression when it arrives at the table."

503,pwHlS9Ef4_x2YRlBeqfNVg,1/17/2022,4 star rating,"I think a good amount of people reviewing here are comparing this place to one of the fancier coffee joints. I personally wouldn't as it doesn't really compare to them and I'd much more compare it to one of the coffee and pastry food carts with a few more options and an area to sit inside. This is very simply a long ran coffee spot which happens to have some pretty cheap (especially for the area) breakfast and lunch pastries. They have a nice mix of iced and hot coffee and tea including some Italian specialties which makes sense from the name. Speaking of which, I was having a bit of difficulty finding this place and I think it's because for some reason it's listed as ""Cafe,"" not Caffe even though all the photos saying it with 2 Fs. Anyway I've had a few drinks here. I have had their cappuccino which is strong and well flavored. If you're a fan of the strength of Starbucks but without the grains flavor found there from over-roasting the beans, you'll probably like it here. The ""regular"" coffee is similarly just as strong as the carts outside. I've also had their iced vanilla frappe which was sweet with a strong coffee taste and I would also recommend it if you want a buzz all day.If you're looking for a no-nonsense strong coffee, this is a good place. It's not as good as places like Daniel's and a few other ones in the area but this isn't a fancy hipster spot. The staff here is also pleasant. Upper 3 for the reasonable prices and good strong coffee."
504,pwHlS9Ef4_x2YRlBeqfNVg,10/18/2019,5 star rating,"OMG! I have to complete this review while the experience is fresh in my mind. I've passed this little Cafe Bacio many years and never went inside. It's always packed with people and looks so small a space from the sidewalk. Well today I decided to stop in to grab a quick bite and coffee. I saw the empty seats at the window. As I entered I noticed the line wasn't too long. They looked like grab and go customers. I neared the counter and became disappointed that most everything looked full of carbs. I need something healthy after the bagel breakfast! In a heartbeat a very nice man peeked around the customers ahead of me asking if he could assist me. I said it was my first visit to Cafe Bacio. I told him I was hoping they had something stuffed with spinach or something green! He immediately said ""How about Spinach Pie?"" I replied asking if I could see it. I didn't want a huge piece today. He immediately brought it out and I was sold. I asked if he would kindly heat it. Then I asked the smiling young lady for a small coffee to go with it. I said I would sit at the counter to eat. My coffee was ready and Spinach Pie heated including a fork and knife with it ready to eat. When he rang it up and said $7.40 I was ecstatic! I carefully maneuvered the space and took a great corner seat in the window. After I ate I noticed the electric plug on the wall at my feet. Perfect timing before my phone died! Now I'm going to tell you how pleased I was with the taste and portion of my Spinach Pie. I love the delicate crust and plenty of spinach. I'm not burping up over-seasoning in the filling. It was also the perfect size for the light lunch I wanted. The coffee was pretty good too. I will enjoy the coffee again when I eat here. 12 Oz is a good size for my third cup of the day! The decor is very cute romantic and French feel. One of my favorite prints hangs on one wall. There's tables and chairs but I prefer the counter where I can look out the window. I can't say enough about how kind, friendly and efficient the employees were today. I really had a good experience. I'm sorry if I took too many photos. I want to savor the memories. I may not get to squeeze into the busy little cafe every time I want. I've noticed how busy it is for years as I walk past. Now I can say first hand I know why it's so popular! Small business with a family feel is the atmosphere at Cafe Bacio! Try it out as long as you save me a seat at the window!"

Why would you say that to teenagers?"" And the bartender said something like ""how about you don't get involved and mind you're fucking business"" and they go back and forth a little more until he's telling her to get the fuck out and she said ""no I'm gonna finish my drink that I paid for then I'll leave"" and the bartender grabs the drink from her and throws it in her face then she gets up and he takes another drink and throws it in her face, mind you he is also smashing glasses on the ground, throwing bottles and glasses at her. He put his hand on her neck and someone stepped in but I swear he would've hit her right then and there. It was so messed up, the worst thing I've seen happen at a bar. I would give it a zero just cause of that incident - very unacceptable behavior on the bartenders behAlf. He shouldn't have escalated the situation or put his hands on the woman.

This place kind of sucks, but works well enough for what it is.It's a dive bar with an arcade machine in the back, a pool table, blase bartenders and cheap prices.While I often find myself here, I try to avoid it because it feels like you're drinking in your less than cool friend's divorced mom's basement.There is nothing to write home about, and I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to come here. If you have a member in your party that is a cheapskate, this will be fine enough. Which is often why I'm here."

These are what we have (pointing at the menu above), take your time and let me know if you have any questions""He was definitely nice enough to make us feel ready to order and we did like we've always ordered there.

I knew what I wanted walked up to the deli counter the store was empty I was the only customer to find a young deli man much more interested in reading  his messages & sending out his texts .... he was facing me but never looked up to greet me but I watched him with his phone in his hand ... Finally I had to say are you ready ???Like Smh ... so I gave the kid the order for the hero and patiently waited .... I wanted to order a side of their macaroni salad .... he made my hero fast and brought it to the cashier..... mean while I'm still standing by the deli counter waiting to ask for my macaroni salad ...Ya think he would ask me anything else ??  I did order it !!! Now for the two female cashiers up front ....  mind you the store was still empty I had placed a can of soda & two bags of chips on the counter ... these two not interested in what's going on outside the counter just their own conversation about what shifts they would be working !!!!Rang me up and bagged my order super fast ... asked for a few extra napkins because I was eating in my car and she threw my napkins in the bag ... maybe normal behavior for her ?? IDK!My hero looked fantastic, however the kid failed in following simply instructions; no extra mayo, No Salt only pepper on one side of hero !!!Mac salad asked for the same,  Salt & Pepper only to find pepper!!! The help here needs to be properly trained or even replaced ... these younger kids really have no interest in what they do....  Definitely a good hero, fresh Italian seeded hero; fresh Boars head cold cuts they just fall short in dressing the hero & following instructions !!!  I don't know maybe they have the Salt & Pepper in one shaker ??? We all know that don't work !!!And to think I left Howard Beach to come over here for my hero ... Thanks,Greg D & family"

Also, I've never sat in the restaurant to eat, but have noticed they don't have a trash receptacle available for guests to use so it piles up on tables and at the drink station.

A waste of money. I had a cake with a red leaf decoration and white shreddered chocolate tasting like a fridge.  It was disgusting as I could tell the white chocolate is not fresh and absorbed the fridge taste(smell) as if I was eating a refrigerator.  I ate a few bites and could not finish.  I suggested I could bring them back to the store but the lady who bought them said she didn't want to go back as the store girls were arrogant.  I stopped by the shop to speak with a manager who was nice but I could tell the girls behind of the showcase are not sweetest as selling sweet, delicate bread and pastries.  $12 per cake.

(Many reviewers complain about that). Coffee was not anything special but was good. They don't make iced coffee - just regular hot poured over ice. Which makes sense considering Europe and the fact that it's almost impossible to get iced coffee most places there too. I would come back to try a pastry and have a cappuccino in house so I can have the full experience and see what this place is really about.Staff wasn't very friendly as others have mentioned- not a place you walk into with smiles- not rude either just not like you are doing anything for them- but maybe that goes with the French theme. ;) Only reviewed so I can find my way back.

I usually come in just for baguette, a mini pain au chocolat or for their palmiers. Regrettably, they don't have my favorite pastry- Madeline's, but they do have tons of French macaroons. The croissants and pain au chocolat are the perfect mix of butter, crispness, and sweetness. Almost as I've transported to France. I don't come as much as I should here.

I used my app and hit my TO GO collection to search for the nearest food business. There it was Cafe Bilboquet. Boy was I happy I bookmarked this beautiful Cafe. First off I'm not in the habit of ordering without checking the prices first. Since my rent took a big reduction I'm going to enjoy the extra cash! I looked over the items and decided the Peach Sandwich sounded great. My helper behind the counter was so sweet to advise me based on sugar content and my other food allergies. The bread sounded delicious too. He heated it up and let me take his photo. Bonus points for that! I decided to go outside to eat. The spaces are like having your own little private booth. It's very comfortable although my table needed to be cleaned. I am not going to deduct for that because I'm finding that to be an issue every place I go to eat lately! The delicious sandwich alone is well worth Five Stars.One note I showed proof of vaccination at the register but changed my mind and sat outside. Like I said it was a great outdoor seating space and the weather is beautiful today. I'm recommending Cafe Bilboquet. Even the restroom is luxurious! Check out the picture of Amy Winehouse near the unisex restroom!

We got regular coffee and iced matcha. Both are good but nothing extraordinary. I do have to mention the matcha is nice that they didn't make it sweet/ actually didn't add any sugar etc. They sell the cffee beans too in case if you want to try making some at home. The bakery didn't look great but to be fair, we are also there when they are closing soon. Would drop by again if I'm in the neighborhood!"

572,ciAah2_V_2km3K4RrXresA,2/2/2020,4 star rating,"This place is really cute! Quaint little coffee shop tucked away in Washington Heights. They have one large communal table for people sit at as well as some bar stools and counters. I have not tried their pastries but they always look so temptings it's hard to resist. The baristas are really helpful and very knowledgeable about coffee and tea. They have several different types of milk, my personal favorite oat milk which just makes all the lattes and other coffee drinks just taste so much better. It is a great little study spot if you can find a seat. The only downside is that because the shop is so small it fills up quite quickly and sometimes it can be a little challenging to find a seat. I come here all the time during my lunch break at work and I almost always can find a seat but its a little squished."

You can see here that this place had amazing reviews and they're totally justified. I had never tried Malaysian food before this, and was really intrigued by the various options they had. I visited for dinner, but I'm dying to go back and try their breakfast option.I've heard they are super busy mid-day for their traditional brunch/lunches, but on a Saturday around 7pm they had a few open tables. You order at the counter then choose your own seating. Starting with drinks, we got the Bandung which is made of rose syrup, condensed, and evaporated milk. It's like if tres leches cake was a rose flavored drink. I loved it! It was super sweet but I thought it was great. We also tried the Teh Tarik which tasted like a traditional black milk tea. Not as sweet, but just as good. I have heard their coffee is very strong, so I'll be back to try it.I tend to be fairly seafood averse, which doesn't make this cuisine ideal. We ordered the Char Kway Teow (which a malaysian friend of mine said was a MUST). It comes with shrimp which I didn't realize before hand, but it wasn't an offensive flavor at all. This was genuinely the first time that I enjoyed shrimp. The menu does indicate that it's ""mild spice"" but I didn't find it to have any chili flavor. That being said, I loved the dish and the noodle texture. The Nasi Lemak was also super interesting. I found it to be quite spicy at first, but that subsided as we finished the fried anchovies on top. This is another dish that I never would've anticipated enjoying! I loved the peanut flavor though and the cucumbers on the side were very pleasant and balanced the dish well.Lastly we had the Chicken Jerky Bun. The pineapple bun was delicious and it was nice to have another mildly sweet dish to balance the rest of the flavors we had going.This is a humble shop with amazing food and beverages. Would totally recommend it!"

The tea flavor of the  teh tarik wasn't that strong. It was a bit watered down. However, I did like that it came in a pouch.

The nasi lemak portion looked small but it was just nice. The nasi was lightly coconutty but it wasn't piping hot; the ikan bilis and peanuts were seasoned perfectly but not crispy or crunchy. The sambal on the side was really good but they gave a tiny portion, and additional sambal was an extra charge. The char kway teow had a nice wok hei flavor and it was cooked to order which was nice, but it was a small portion for the price. I only had a bite to sample since it's the hubby's dish. He liked it but thought it was over priced. Both hubby and kid liked the belacan wings. The lobak looked good but was dry and a tad bland. The kid's fishball noodles soup was bland.

There are a few small tables inside, counter seats by the window, and long tables with benches. You go up to the counter and order, then the staff will bring you your items if you dine in. Some of the best items to order include:- Kaya Butter Toast: The toast is fully loaded with kaya jam, which is delicious! It's not overly sweet and the pandan flavor is really apparent. Definitely suggest getting this, even if it's not breakfast time. - Tok Tok Mee: The option served here is dry, without any broth directly in the dish or on the side. The combination of cha siu, yao choy, and pork wontons with the dark sauce is very flavorful. The noodles have a nice, slightly chewy texture. - Pan Mee (Soup): Similarly, the texture of the hand-pulled noodles were nice and chewy. The broth is fishy and salty (as expected due to the anchovies). - Lychee Bandung: The drink was very refreshing and served in a little pouch with actual lychees. The rose syrup made the beverage a bit more balanced with floral notes. Don't forget to stir the drink so the syrup mixes properly. However, the Char Kway Teow was a bit lackluster relative to everything else and the chili paste was barely noticeable (the dish reminded me more of a Chinese beef chow fun).

The friend chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy inside. For my side, I got onion rings. The onions rings were decent and it reminded me of BK's onion rings.

The chicken is pretty good - it's a unique spice that's not too hot and the crisp is great but it's not something I ever crave, and certainly not worth the long wait. I'm not sure why it takes so long since it always looks like there's a ton of chicken just like, right there. Both to go and to stay it's a 40 minute wait and the place isn't packed.The fries are shoestring, and pretty good, and the portion is decent too. For the price, $12 for a two piece dark and fries, it just seems pricey and it's overall an okay meal.

I love how big the tenders are. They also have a kiosk where you can order. Their fries are always so crispy. Even after coming here multiple times, the quality still remains the same. Only complain I have is I wish they gave more sauce since their tenders are huge."

This place has a wide variety of fried chicken sandwiches to choose from. we ordered their Firebird Sandwich and The Blue Ribbon Sandwich. The Firebird Sandwich was crispy, you can tell they put it on a  homemade bun. That bun tasted fresh and slathered with spicy chipotle mayo which gave that spicy kick but soothe your month with pickled peppers and pickled cucumbers. If you enjoy spicy chicken this is the one you should get! The Blue Ribbon Sandwich aka classic was simply a Fried Chicken with Pickles and Mayo on a Potato Bun. Now we into the classic although it was simple, you know what they say "" simplicity is the best beauty"" and for sure it was!"

The coleslaw was just awful and seemed like it was seasoned with a ton of pepper...the wildflower honey and chipotle honey bbq sauce was amazingly delicious! Oh my, I almost forgot the biscuit...so flaky and because I'm greedy I added butter and wildflower honey and babbbbbyyyyy it was a hit!!!!!!"

We got the tender bowl supreme and the firebird sandwich and it was plenty of food for 2 people! The tenders had a subtle seasoning on them (and were rather large) and the firebird was perfectly spicy.. and those fries were delicious! Pro tip: get bacon on the firebird!"

However, it just did not deliver. The chicken was kind of cold, tasted a little old, and lacked flavor. It was missing the key elements of a good chicken tender. The chicken and fries were also extremely oily, which wasn't my favorite. The slaw was in a tiny container, but it was ok, because i didn't like it at all. I did also get a Buffalo chicken dog, that was probably the best thing. The milkshakes were good. The loaded fries were probably the best because the bacon tasted so good. Thoroughly disappointed thought.The service was great though. The cashier was so knowledgeable and friendly."

I got  the firebird sandwich hot and sweet sandwich a side of fries and biscuits which came out to around $42. I'm not sure what happened but they messed up our order, they gave us Mac and cheese instead of fries. They just gave it to us for free since we already opened it and they gave us a bigger order of fries which was nice. The moment I saw the sandwich I already knew it wasn't going to be as crispy as advertised. The sandwich itself had good amount of flavor mostly cause of the spicy mayo but the it wasn't spicy and was not crispy which I already suspected. The star of the show was the fries for me. It was thin and crispy; just how I like it. The Mac cheese was pretty good too; the pasta was over cooked but it was nice and cheesy. Probably would go back just for the fries lol."

618,IRd9AJz31MNOmtNWA974ZQ,11/2/2022,1 star rating,The only place I've ever been that requires you to have a conversation with the manager to figure out the price of items because they aren't posted anywhere. Keep in mind this is a large bodega type place that has multiple stations. They bank on busy people to just get duped into whatever price they charge. Will never go back when there are normal establishments less than a block away who don't try to hide their prices.

620,IRd9AJz31MNOmtNWA974ZQ,6/9/2019,3 star rating,"MONA is a convenient place to grab lunch or a snack near the UN, but is terribly terribly overpriced. They have a variety of options, including a salad and hot food bar, espresso drinks, smoothies and açaí bowls, sushi, and made to order sandwiches. There is some seating but during peak lunch hours it can be pretty busy. I got a prosciutto sandwich and it was honestly not that good. Thankfully my boss was paying otherwise I would be super upset. The prosciutto was not really prosciutto at all, but rather thickly cut ham that was very difficult to chew and quite tough - I ended up taking it all off my sandwich and was left with fig spread, cheese, spinach, and tomato.It did look like they had other good sandwiches and plenty of other things to try, but I'm just really turned off by the $10 sandwich that I didn't even like. It seemed like my coworkers were satisfied with their lunches, and I'll probably end up here again for another lunch meeting in the future, so we'll see."
621,IRd9AJz31MNOmtNWA974ZQ,8/4/2016,4 star rating,"Food-wise this place is pretty awesome! There's a hot/cold buffet style line-up which charges by weight, so if you're strategic you can get salmon/asparagus/sushi/Greek salad/octopus/whatever for like $6-7 (provided you don't eat much). It's great. The fish does sometimes still have bones in it randomly. Packaged food items are on the spendier side, but of higher quality (organic/non-GMO-ish stuff). Coffee stand: I ordered a cold brew and it was approximately 70% crushed ice (why?), 25% cream, and a splash of coffee. They don't let you do your own milk/cream (I'm not super picky but I used to be a barista and it's way beyond a normal serving or splash at the top). Only one size for iced drinks. Lemonade from the juice bar is SO GOOD, and far more sour than sweet, perfect for a hot summer day. Employee yelled at me once for sitting on a ledge (which seemed odd because tons of other people were as it was raining and the place was packed). Whoops. Cashiers are some of the friendliest I've seen in NYC."
622,IRd9AJz31MNOmtNWA974ZQ,7/1/2018,3 star rating,"MONA is just like any other New York deli or bodega with a hot self-serve buffet, only that it's nicer-looking from a decor standpoint and has a reasonable amount of seating even during the lunch rush (granted, it can get extremely hot inside even on cool days; fortunately there's a public outdoor courtyard with more seating nearby). As for the food, the buffet is a bit pricey even by New York standards, but if you stick to modest amounts of proteiny items like salmon or chicken as opposed to heavy (read: carb-laden) or watery (read: salad or veggie-oriented) items, you should be getting a pretty good deal. You can also pick up salads, sandwiches, and even sushi separately. Even if the prices are a tad spendy, this place makes up for them with a reasonably comprehensive selection, its reasonable amount of seating, and its clean bathrooms. A decent choice."

This place will definitely visually impress someone without having to spend a lot of money. I only tried their sandwiches. The portions are large for a good price. The turkey and avacdo sandwich tasted very fresh and clean. I thought it could have a little more spices but it was still a pretty decent sandwich overall. I have tried neither the buffet, salad, nor the coffee shop but I will definitely come back!"

Their coffee is fantastic, and their food seems to be surprisingly well priced (something unusual for coffee shops in midtown east). This opening right across from my office means that I will be here more often than I should, but I'm glad that they have a really fantastic variety of foods and snacks for me to choose from.The baristas here are also really fantastic and really friendly. Anytime I've stopped in, the people working the coffee counter are really kind and extremely helpful when I'm being indecisive. This was different from the sandwich counter where they just couldn't seem to get the register to ring up things correctly. I think once they work out a few kinks, this place will be golden and I'm glad to have it so near by!"

My niece only ate California rolls and she never likes to try anything. I told her she needs to try news things and she agreed. When we arrived at the restaurant, it was not crowded at all (A+), so we were able to sit closer to the television (the Olympics was on). The gentleman took our orders and returned with our beverages. Once the food arrived, I was delighted and so were they. The food was amazing, fresh, seasoned and ready to be devoured! The nice gentleman noticed my niece struggling with her chop sticksnand made her an easy to use one, by using a piece of paper and rubber band! I honestly couldn't thank him enough. Attentive, clean, and I was able to watch the Olympics! Food was amazing and I didn't break the bank. Safe to say, we're going back again soon. Thanks Kiku"

The concept, the food, the vibe, the private rooms suitable for lounging while eating...all of it. It was a tough act to follow but Kiku has been reliable, consistent and inviting. Stopped for lunch a few weeks ago after a long hiatus. However, I like to treat my staff to lunch on Fridays and they predictably choose this place twice/month...more often than any other option.Sat outside on one of those 90+ degree days. The waitstaff was attentive and gracious. If Kumamotos are offered anywhere, I want them. I recall the reasonable price of 3 for $10 and so I requested,'9 please.'Sweet waitstaff returns and delivers 5 K. oysters. That's all they had. Looked great and albeit just south of fresh, I enjoyed them. Hamachi jalapeño crudo, naruto and a few stixful of my spouse's maki, were good. Thing is...good is not great."

Like always I have to order at least one piece of unagi sushi.  Everything was delicious.Edamame was ordered for the table and I ordered the duck buns as an appetizer.  The edamame had less salt than I would have liked but that probably was a good thing...  lol.

Even with such a large group, all of the dishes came out at the same time and very quickly after ordering which was impressive!  The menu is large so there are definitely options for everyone and all tastes.The summer rolls ($7) were somewhat loosely rolled and messily plated so they did not hold up well when eating.  The rolls were mostly fresh vegetables with a few mini shrimp in them.The pad woon sen with chicken was, again, not plated well but it had a good sized portion of chicken and was overall a filling portion size.  The dinner meal was only $13 which makes this restaurant a great and affordable spot."

ServiceNo complaints. They were fine, fast and checked in. Vibes: It's a nice place. They don't have a front wall technically so you get a view of the sidewalk and a nice breeze.

It's not a big place, so reservations should be made. It's definitely not for those who have more than 4 people in their party. They only have one gender less bathroom, too, so be wary of that.I did glance at the menu online prior to heading to the restaurant. They did have a drink menu, but I didn't see any mocktails. However, we did ask, and they had one which was strawberry flavored. It was a bit too sweet, so I probably wouldn't order that again. I eyed the Diavola pizza  which I chose as it had tomatoes, marinara, chili, spicy salami, and mozzarella. It didn't really look good, but it was delicious. We also ordered the carpacci. The first one in that section is Carpaccio di Polpo - thinly sliced Octopus in lemon dressing, and that's what I got for the table. I didn't like it too much as I hardly tasted or saw the Octopus. I tasted a cold salad and some ice chips. It was strange. I didn't like the pasta that was ordered either. Cacio e pepe was ordered, and in it was spaghetti with cheese and black pepper. The flavoring wasn't what I expected, I had to add a lot of red pepper flakes to this dish. Last but not least, we ordered the tiramisu. It was good! I'm not sure I would go back as there are so many Italian places in Queens and in Astoria."

We made a reservation for 8:15, and we're seated almost immediately despite coming a few minutes late.Small little place, the indoor area was pretty cold, and the windows were open to the outside so the ac and the breeze outside were all kicking in. The lighting in the table is intimate. Dim lighting, small lamp bright enough to read the menu but not bright enough to see the stains on your bf's shirt. We got the carbonara, gnocchi alla sorrentina with chicken, and the Pomodoro bruschetta. I found the portion size to be quite small for $18 entrées. After finishing the appetizer and the entrée, I felt mildly(?) full and I'm petite! The size of carbonara was like a double ice cream scoop, easily devour-able. Strong flavors in both entrees. We liked the bruschetta! Toasted and extra crunchy, with a side of bread (not toasted). The sangria was alright, I liked it - more on the sour side and not too strong. The tables were pretty small, I felt like I was going to knock the pitcher of water over and there was barely enough room to put anything more than 1 dish on the table. The bellboy/waiters kept coming by to take our dishes away (almost immediately) once we finished. Food did feel like it took some time to come, but it was super hot when it arrived. A party of 2 came in around 8:50pm-ish and they didn't make reservations. They were easily able to grab a spot, many tables open."

The pasta dishes were about $20 for a big portion size (you will be full) and the cakes were able $10, which feels expensive but really requires 3 people to eat it! Ambience: this place has a great vibe to it! I ended up sitting in the outdoor space to stay safe because of covid but honestly the inside area seems so amazing! It feels like a very cozy yet upscale wine bar, which is hard to come by in Astoria, so I was happy with that! Covid safety: they have our door seating with heat lamps!"

So that was a plus point. Had brown rice with bean curd and zucchini mushroom. However the food quality made me hesitated on the rating. It's not bad, but it's just okay. Brown rice has a peculiar smell (NOT because it went bad though, but I don't know it smelled damp) The tofu was okay, but I think it's too heavy on MSG and greasy hahaha. Price was good! I'm really contemplating between giving a 3 and a 4 but I think I have to settle for 3. Definitely not a bad choice for cheap and quick chinese night, but don't expect too much for the quality."

I'm not sure what the big to do is about. The General Tso's could have been more tender, it had too many hard chewy parts. The lo mien was OK when you got a bite with a proper amount of grease on it, overall the dish was dry. The fried crab sticks, which are admittedly not gourmet cuisine wherever you order them from, were especially bad, with a rubbery texture. The visual was worse than the taste, once you bite into one you can see the imitation crab separating from itself along a very clear line. Wonton soup was good enough. Chicken wings were ok but again, I've had amazing, juicy, tender wings from Chinese takeout joints and these didn't compare."

There was always a long line at Joe's Pizza, and we finally got to try their pizza today after 3 attempts. My son said the deep dish pepperoni pizza from Carnegie Pizza is much better than Joe's Pizza. There could be a line here but never as long as Joe's. There are a few table seats available for customers to eat inside. We're happy to take some Carnegie pizza back to California."

We all know there's a pizza shop on almost every corner near Times Square.So I'm picky with my pizza. So my 3 reviews is really based on the pizza. We ordered a simple large pizza 1/2 plain and 1/2 pepperoni nothing special and it was ordered to go. While waiting here's some tips:- Service was friendly - Lots of different toppings to select from - Desserts they have are the following:Cannoli (someone said if the cannoli cones already have cream inside of it don't get it) and it had the cream already so it wasn't fresh.NY cheesecake it was ehh ok.Chocolate mousse cheesecake... ok this was pretty good and satisfied my sweet tooth.- They take credit card- They sell an Upside Down Pizza... yah what's that right? Well it's literally cheese placed on the dough first THEN the red sauce... I know weird but I am curious myself how it tastes.So ate our pizza at home and the dough at the bottom was not as crispy as I liked it. It was good but I didn't find it the best. I'd definitely try it again but would eat it fresh next time."

It's one of those pizza shops where you can dine in, have them fire up the pizza slices for you to eat them to go.Me and 4 others swung by after gazing at the Christmas Lights Display around NYC. We all decided on NY Style pizza. All four of us ordered different flavors and toppings all but 2 had a few slices to take back for the flight home the next day. Fun place to grab and go. According to their website, it looks like this is their only location in NYC. This particular location is best if you are in Times Square and just a few steps away from Port Authority. Tbh, the pizza is delicious! My friends ordered garlic balls which I should for next time. Service is fast, but with so many pizza shops all around the city, I would visit regularly. Pay with cash because your credit card will be charged a 3.95% transaction fee. They also have chilled beer to go!"

There was a line.  That's good.  Staff was patient and friendly helping this Hawaii girl choose her NY pizza slices.Ordered a Sicilian pepperoni, Margherita,and  Vodka Sauce slices. Took a bite out of each to see if I wanted to bring any home to the hubby back in Hawaii. Whoa!  So so onolicous (amazingly delicious in pidgin) I inhaled the Margherita.  So tangy and fresh. The crust so thin and perfection.   I went back in line and ordered an eggplant sicilian slice, garlic knots (that just came out of the oven and were so garlicy.  Love it), and another Margherita slice.  Can't wait to pop these back in the air fryer to reheat them to share with the hubby."

The staff was extremely nice and very gracious, having packed is plates and utensils before we were fully able to request them. They had staff maintaining the cleanliness inside and out, making it inviting as we passed by. The pizza was so delicious (as Chicago pizza folks we almost didn't want to admit this!)! The sauce was so delicious, and made the pizza in a way that an ingredient can make or break things. The mozzarella was scrumptious. The freshness of the basil was a if it had been recently picked from a garden. The crust was perfect. We ate the entire pizza, plus a few garlic knots. Whether you're native to NY OR visiting, this is a good place to stop and grab a slice. Or a full box."

There's a seating area in the back that isn't too large, and you can see all the different kinds of pizza laid out. The garlic knots looked super tempting, so we decided to get an order of those as well. I will say that I absolutely love garlic but those were the most garlicky garlic knots I've ever had in my entire life. It was honestly a little too much and it pains me to say that because garlic bread is one of my favorite things. I tried a couple of bites of my friends' pizzas and they were all so delicious. The crust was the perfect thickness and crispiness, and the balance of flavors was also great."

There is a downstairs where you order and can sit on the sides. My favorite spot is the upstairs where they have a large table, small tables around it and then comfy large chairs. You're not supposed to sleep there but sometimes it's impossible. Like many Starbucks, if you sit there long enough, you'll come out smelling like coffee. I love the atmosphere. It always feels warm and comfy. It's part of the Starbucks brand but I feel like this one is extremely comfy since it isn't too large or small in size.The staff is great. I've seen a few workers come and go over the last 5 years. I had staff prepare me a bagel before I even got there before online ordering was a thing. I used to get a bagel everyday! The guy doesn't work there anymore but it was greatly appreciated.It does get very hectic because it's Starbucks in a high traffic area. There are a few around the area so you have your choices.

Also they intentionally wrote down my name in a wrong way while my name is a normal European name! Disgusting. Coffee is off as usual in Starbucks, prices are at least twice if compared to Europe and 3-4 times higher than in Moscow."

What warrants it the extra star, in my opinion, is the job the nice staff did in hosting a pre-marathon party for our charity group. The space upstairs was reserved for us for  about 2 hours and they put out a nice spread of wraps, bagels and bakery goodies. This was a comfortable space for us to meet our teammates and I got sample some things in addition to my favorite iced lemon loaf."

I keep it simple with a cold brew or iced coffee (with no classic), but I get the occasional cappuccino and they fill it up to the top. You'll see some Starbucks/other coffee shops give it with half foam. It makes a difference. Lol They are also super quick in the morning - whether you order on mobile and in-store.

I work next door and get other beverages and foods, so I'm saying daily if not twice daily I check for decaf. How do you not have decaf? What happens with pregnant people or people with heart conditions? To make matters worse, they list that they do have decaf on the app, so you'll order it and then they tell you when you arrive that they don't have it and what else do you want."

I stepped up and the employee saw I was first and asked me if they can help me. I made a side eye to the rude girl and said, ""I guess I'm invisible"". The employee assumed I was talking to them and started on this whole tangent about, ""I never said that sir. I was not referring to you as invisible"". Twice I said, ""Not you"". But he kept going. I don't have time for stupid arguments when I'm already late for work thanks to Starbucks' understaffed, incredibly inefficient way of doing things.I just said, ""is my stuff ready or not?"" He kept going on and said it's not there. Two minutes later he re-looks and it's been sitting there the whole time.I've noticed Starbucks are perpetually understaffed, the people they do have should not be working in that industry and there's no system that works efficiently for waiting on all the customers they get.

Ivan Ramen is a really cute restaurant between LES and EV that serves ramen and a few appetizers. The menu is small, but everything I tasted was delicious. We started with the cauliflower appetizer, which included fried cauliflower, a delicious curry sauce, and shaved (maybe fried?) ginger on the top. Everything came together beautifully, and I thought the curry sauce was absolutely delicious. The cauliflower also did not get soggy throughout our meal and tasted as crisp as when it came out. I ordered some of the pickles, which were spicy and salty and delicious. My friend ordered the chicken ramen and added spicy sauce to it. It was definitely spicy, but the broth had a  really deep and tasty flavor. Overall, I really liked this place. The staff and service was amazing, and the food was stellar. Now to return and actually try the ramen!"

699,wqYHhMnpdfUVGL5JI3Wi_A,3/15/2023,4 star rating,"Came here for lunch, no reservation, was seated immediately. Host was very kind although I did not get her name, we decided to get the Japanese fried chicken , crispy Eggplant, and the Chicken Paitan ramen. Crispy Eggplant: really enjoyed this! Texture was on point, very crispy on the outside, inside was nice and soft. It comes plated on a sesame sauce, which paired nicely. Overall a pretty mild flavored dish, but done well.Japanese fried chicken: unfortunately I didn't like this as much as I was expecting to. Unlike a traditional Karaage, it has a wet garlic caramel sauce on it and comes w a shisho ranch sauce on the side. We ended up sending this dish back because it was too acidic for us, I felt the wet sauce took away from it. They very kindly comped it off our bill which was greatly appreciated. That being said the shisho ranch sauce was really good! Just wish I liked the actual chicken more. Chicken Paitan Ramen: enjoyed this! Comes w a soft egg yolk on top that you mix into the broth and ground chicken. Pretty light but flavorful, pretty heavy on the black pepper so if you don't like that, I'd get another dish, but I enjoyed the peppery flavor. Noodles were thin and cooked well.Also want to note service was very good and fast here! Shoutout to our server Aimee, she was very kind and helpful. Ambience was nice as well."
700,wqYHhMnpdfUVGL5JI3Wi_A,2/13/2023,4 star rating,"I came here after seeing the Chef's Table episode about Ivan, the restaurant's founder. He has a really interesting story, and his restaurant makes really delicious food. Unfortunately, he wasn't in the kitchen on the day I went. I had a reservation for 1pm on a Sunday, but arrived early. They were able to seat me where I wanted on the counter, even though the restaurant was quite busy. And it was busy for a good reason. The ambience is Japanese-style comic book (not Manga, the western-style comic book). It's a fun and unpretentious vibe, but with a lot of thought behind the decor, and the flatware/silverware. I started my meal with the Kyuri (cucumber pickles). They were well-made, but beware, they're quite spicy. Consider yourself warned. My friend had the pork buns. He really liked them, but s not as good at describing food as I am. The buns were not spicy, but he said one of the garnishes inside it was. He did not consider the dish itself to be spicy, and he said he thought it tasted really good. The crispy eggplant was incredible - probably my favorite dish of the meal. The coating on the eggplant was crispy, but the eggplant itself was tender - perfectly cooked. It came on top of a delicious sesame sauce. It felt reminiscent of the Japanese ""goma nasubi"" dish, but with a New York twist. I loved the dish and would order it again. That said, (suggestion based on personal preference - not a criticism) it would be cool if the sauce came inside the eggplant instead of underneath. Cutting the eggplant would let it cool down faster, and the sauce being on the inside would make eating it a different experience. The ramen itself is not your traditional Japanese ramen - but I really enjoyed it nonetheless. The chef mixes rye flour into the noodles, giving it an interesting texture. The noodles come firm at first, but soften up as they sit in the broth. They don't feel particularly springy, but are still a delight to eat. The broth itself was probably the best ramen broth I have tasted in my life - the umami was strong, but the broth did not leave you dying of thirst after having it. I also really appreciated the grilled tomato - it was something different - it tasted almost Italian. It's apparent that although this restaurant is a ramen spot, and celebrates the 20 years Ivan spent living in Japan, the restaurant does not purport to be 100% traditionally Japanese. Instead, while being firmly rooted in proper Japanese cuisine, I appreciate how each dish also brings in an element of Ivan's New York heritage. For example, while the Kyuri is a traditional Japanese appetizer, the pickles were more akin to NY deli pickles, and while the ramen looks traditional to the ye, the noodles contain rye flour - a testament to Ivan's background (I learned the rye part from the Chef's table episode). The food is delicious, and each dish tells a story. It's creative and delicious, and I plan on coming back. I docked a star because although the service was good, it did feel a bit rushed at times. That said, the restaurant was quite busy on the day I went."

This place isn't bad at all, but I wouldn't put it at my top recommendations for ramen in NYC.  If you do like ramen that packs a punch, then I think this place would be good for you. My loves for the restaurant:- Great service and attentive staff. They explain the menu very well and provide excellent recommendations based on your preferences. They don't hover too much and they're there when you need them - The buckwheat noodle style. I preferred this with the punchy flavors of the ramen because it's not as thick and heavy as the other noodle styles The part that left me hanging might just have been the broth itself. Does it taste different from other restaurants? Absolutely. But, it just felt like too much for me. It's a very stimulating experience, so if you're wanting a homier style of ramen, I would try another place."

This is a five star establishment. The ramen isn't super traditional but it is super delicious. I love the tonkotsu ramen. The apps are also money specifically pork buns and fried chicken. They have a great beer menu, wonderful sake selection, and lots of other good looking drinks. The vibe inside is really cool, lots of playful comics above the bar that I love. Also there is solid outdoor seating in the garden. My one qualm is that the service is a bit too fast. I like a well timed service that gives you ample time for apps, chit chat, and dinner. They rushed through everything a bit too quickly for my liking."
703,wqYHhMnpdfUVGL5JI3Wi_A,2/27/2023,1 star rating,"Ivan Ramen's QR code menu was SUPER pretentious, all but forcing you to watch a video on each dish's origins before it gave you any information on, I don't know, what was in it. This level of self-importance would have been easily forgiven if the bowl had been great, but it was barely edible, and the reason why is...... salt. I don't know what happened in the kitchen that day, whether this was an aberration, or whether every Ivan-celebrator just reallllly likes salt. But I reallllly like salt most of the time, and it was about a thousand times too much for me. When they pickled the mustard greens and the wood ear mushrooms, is it possible they just poured the pickling water into my soup? It was medicinally salty, chemically so. I could smell it when they put the bowl down - I picked the bowl up to sniff it curiously before I even lifted a spoon to my mouth.If ratings were an average of how well each ingredient was prepared, Ivan would have done okay, actually. The pork was a perfect melt-in-your-mouth ring, the noodles firm and chewy, the egg delightfully orange and runny. But none of those things mattered because they all sat in the Great Salt Lake of Ramen."

Fun vibes with the waitstaff both taking their jobs seriously and not taking themselves too seriously while selecting different Christmas songs and dancing along. The wall art was unique resembling graffiti/comic book art. We sat at the bar and had a direct view of where the magic happens.Would recommend getting a beer to go with your ramen. We got the tonkatsu (garlic, umami, rich) and chicken paitan (Ivan's favorite, clean, homey) ramen. Definitely hit the spot given the paucity of thoughtfully created ramen dishes in our area (please feel free to prove me wrong)."
705,wqYHhMnpdfUVGL5JI3Wi_A,12/19/2022,5 star rating,"We had a lovely dinner at Ivan Ramen yesterday. The bartender (brunette with bleached eyebrows) at the counter was a delight, she gave us recommendations and provided great service. We ordered:* Crispy Eggplant ($13)* Yuzu Lemonade ($4)* Ivan Palmer ($4)* Tonkotsu Ramen ($19)* Tokyo Shio Ramen (18)We spent a total of $63.16 - a little pricy but the food was delicious. The fried eggplants had a delicate crispy breading on the outside and had a silk like consistency on the inside. The drinks were tart and refreshing -- some might say they're not sweet at all compared to traditional lemonade and Arnold Palmers. The unsweetened barley tea is very prominent in the Ivan Palmer even when you mix it together but it was very good. It was a nice palate cleanser to cut through the richness of the ramen. I LOVED the broth of the Tonkotsu ramen. It is jam packed flavorful with tender pork and bits of mushroom. Tokyo Shio ramen had a very deep yet ""clean"" tasting broth. The tomato was a nice umami bomb which is an unusual topping but totally worked. Both bowls didn't look like a lot of food but we left feeling stuffed. The only thing we weren't too crazy about was their noodles. They were a bit lackluster and wished they were wavier for texture. Also they only have one dessert on their menu which is their Yuzu Cheesecake. But overall we had satisfying dinner."

Comic-lined walls and invite you into a cozy, quick-to-serve slurp shop, where, spoiler alert, the best thing on the menu isn't the ramen but the fried chicken. Service is quick as staff tries to keep up with the demand Netflix created with their hit show Chef's Table. If I were more of a ramen fan, I might give this 5 stars, but my ceiling for ramen just isn't high enough!"

Because one Korean lady just give me bad attitude because of my wet hands. I am so sick of people keep teaching me how to behave!!! This negative review is not for Paris Baguette here, is for the back Korean bookstore, I took a picture of, who treated me like crap!!! After I said sorry to her, she gave me a long face!! You not supposed to treat me that way!!! Last warning or I am filing the personnel complaint online. You are paid to treat customer nicely!!! Not yelling at customer like this because of this and that!!!Update later in March 17, 5:06 PM, while I am back home in Ridgewood Queens, I also know that is not totally the bookstore lady's fault; it is someone who blocked the Dyson hand dryer with the garbage can the reason why I could not dry my hands. So that is someone's fault to whom put the garbage can close to the Dyson hand dryer, that situation in Men's bathroom. That time I was going here for a visit only after my parents went to nearby Radiology which is just down one block.Anyway, this negative review is not for Paris Baguette; it is for the bookstore inside this cafe. And it is not totally the bookstore clerk fault; it is to someone who put the garbage can blocking the hand dryer in Mens restroom where I barely reached to use it; you know that garbage can put there is totally unsanitary! That is why I could not dry my hands after wash and made the bookstore clerk mad at me. This would have not happened to me if they manage the store more properly, including not blocking the hand dryer with something filthy, and something like that."

The location has a parking lot and there's lots of good eats plus hmart around the Paris Baguette. Upon entering, you see all the baked goods covered and not exposed to the air. Individual breads are all wrapped. Plenty of ready to go cakes for occasions. Drink menu has a wide variety. Iced loose leaf tea was not on the menu but the staff are really kind and they offer to make it work. Wifi available and the connection is good if you bring your laptop, although outlets are scarce. Plenty of indoor seating and outdoor seating. There's also a small Korean Christian store -  children's toys, stationary, korean books, bibles, and how to learn korean books. They have the stationary that you only find in the markets in Korea. I couldn't believe I found a goldmine. I had in my heart to get those the next time I planned to go overseas, when lo and behold they are all here in Queens. If you are looking for unique beautiful Asian gift wrapping, try this inner store."

This place has been on a gradual decline ever since it seems they changed management. The manager didn't bother hearing any of my concerns and I felt ignored as if he doesn't care.  It always feels like there's over and understaffing issues whenever I visit.

If hours are drastically impacted by Covid-19, that's fine however the order first claimed 45 mins to deliver, which expanded almost in real time in your grub hub website. Free delivery does not make up for more than 200% more time to deliver your food. Went to fill in the survey but the website ""timed out"" as I finished writing this ^^ basically. Returned to the website to find that I had to not only re-enter everything, but also I couldn't continue, because I needed a store code and order number, which I didn't get, because I didn't get a receipt.

The chicken inside is very well-seasoned. Even the sauce is an excellent addition that further enhances the taste experience. You can tell that they know their stuff and use excellent ingredients!I always appreciate a place that has great default french fries and these folks came through! They're seasoned so well, I didn't even think about adding ketchup!And the Hamburger was equally on point! Cool-sized beef patty, solid bun, fresh lettuce/tomatoes and a delicious sauce. Again, no need or desire for ketchup. The flavor is all here!I got it to-go, so I didn't take much advantage on the dine-in area, but from what I saw, it was comfortable. The lady and gentleman that I encountered behind the counter, who I believe were the owners, were both very warm and pleasant.I'll be here again for sure with reinforcements by way of hungry colleagues also looking for delicious food in the neighborhood!Thanks for a good introduction to your establishment, folks!  I'm so full..."

We had another place in mind, but strong rains forced us to select this place as it was closer to where we were located.It's a nice, small location tucked away in the basement between brownstones. Because there are some outdoor dining tents in front, it's easy to miss if you're walking on the right side of the road.With that said - the food itself was damn good. I had the falafel plate. It can definitely be 2 lunches, but it's not very heavy because there's a decent portion of salad mixed in. I'd come back just for this honestly. The food also came to our table pretty quickly, so that helped too.There are a few tables so you can definitely enjoy eating inside if need be."

I'm talking about whether you eat before or after the show. That's the choice Jamie W. and I had to make before seeing our first show in over two years (""Tina"" review: bit.ly/3mNVOVK). Eating before means constant clock watching, eating afterward means slimmer pickings and post-midnight bloating. We found an ideal solution in this hidden subterranean spot.It's in the middle of Restaurant Row (46th between 8th and 9th). It's next door to one of my favorite small plate spots, Sake Bar Hagi 46 (review: bit.ly/3CRfBt2). I just knew that place would be a bit of a zoo but definitely not this eatery. We walked down a lonely flight of steps to find a clean, compact operation with just a counter and a handful of tables. Even though it was empty of customers, the staff of five was quite busy fulfilling takeout orders as delivery guys came in and out with high frequency.There was quite a selection of fresh salads, bowls and smoothies which they clearly make upon order. It was definitely the right menu before a show where I was sure we'd be getting up to gyrate as we keep rolling on the river. I was sure the woman sitting next to me in the theater would want to deal with the after effects of a big Italian dinner at Lidia's place Becco right across the street. Jamie had the $13.48 Avocado Beet Salad Bowl with Tuna. It was a full, appetizing bowl of fresh ingredients.There was spinach, pickled beets, avocado, roasted Brussels sprouts, pickled onion, dried cranberries, roasted walnuts, and cashew cheese balls drizzled with herb dressing (photo: bit.ly/3mLM1zw). It was delicious, but mine was the winner, the $13.48 Rainbow Salad Bowl with Shrimp. It was made with arugula, spinach, carrot, cabbage, roasted pumpkin and sunflower seeds, pickled onion, cucumber, and bean sprouts drizzled liberally with spicy cashew dressing (photo: bit.ly/3bMZq44). That was a great salad. Robust servings for a great price...and no slow-eating tourists to be found in here.FOOD - 5 stars..healthy eats and robust flavors before rolling on the riverAMBIANCE - 4 stars...compact, subterranean spot well spacedSERVICE - 5 stars...very attentive and food made to orderTOTAL - 5 stars...great pre-show option without the indigestion RELATED - Hungry in NYC?

It's a little like traveling to another place, which obviously is such a rare luxury now *cries in COVID*I came to watch the playoffs in their outdoor seating area and had an amazing time. I really miss that Sunday football vibe and it was alive and well here (who dat?!). They have two TV's inside the bar windows facing the enclosure, sound was great, space heaters strong. The structure is open completely on one side and in other spots throughout, so there is plenty of airflow.Staff are also exceptional, so friendly and going the extra mile to keep customers safe and happy. On the nights I went, they had the most dapper and personable bouncer managing bathroom traffic and keeping the sidewalk clear for customers and pedestrians. They're doing it right here!

He was constantly flirting with me while ignoring the fact that my man was there, he even touched me multiple times on my shoulder making it so uncomfortable. Very much perv energy.There was a man coming in & out the restaurant making a scene. It seemed like he use to work there before because the waiters were speaking to him. He kept repeating that he sold cocaine before he came to New York to work here. About the food, the fries taste like the oil wasn't fresh. The meat from the burger was really tough & dry. It wasn't worth the price basically. I usually do not write an extensive review but the whole vibe here was just awkward to be honest. I'm just going to avoid this place from here on out.Good luck everyone. Hopefully you all have a good experience because I sure didn't."

There was a plate of pickles, & cole slaw for the table. I thought the cole slaw was good, didn't try the pickles. Everything on the platter was good, the tomatoes, lettuce was fresh, bun was soft, lightly toasted & buttered, i think, fries were nice & crispy, everything, except for the main ingredient, the burger itself was a solid chuck of meat. Service was good, decor was that of an old school diner. I believe it's 24/7, at least that's what signage stated."

AND for those who still wish to eat in an exterior environment, they have converted part of their parking into an eating area. Enjoy!"

Upon entering you go to the cash register to order or step to the side to view the options. The ording goes pretty smoothly, the cashiers seem to know how to work the machine quickly. They have the option to scan your code to get points for possible future drinks.  Ordering never takes more than 2 minutes if you know what you want. Depending in how busy it gets it can take about 5 min to 10-15min. The place is relatively clean but small. You may have to wait for your order outside but they do call your number in the speaker when its ready. 5/5 will continue to return"

771,AgBuPYM74--2L8XIuXcS8w,12/12/2020,4 star rating,"I recently revisited this location in my neighborhood and was shocked to find that the drinks here are $2-3 less than what you pay in Manhattan. I rarely have boba so I usually go for unique drinks when I order. This location is tiny, but they have an organized system where you pay inside, then head outside until your number is announced through a megaphone. Probably a little annoying for people living on that block but very helpful for social distancing. That day, I ordered a rose hip milk tea with boba. The price was around $4 for a medium. I caught a hint of tea flavor in my drink but actually didn't like the rose hip in it. It tasted very artificial. I think I just chose the wrong flavor because I've had other drinks here (regular milk tea with boba, milk foam cheese drink, red WOW milk) and liked them all. The boba are soft and chewy, and the menu extensive with a variety of flavors both fruity and milky. Overall, this is a refreshing and affordable alternative for boba lovers to get their fix."

It's that perfect mixture of sweet and sour, and not overpoweringly sweet like some other bubble tea beverages. Also, the bubbles are perfect! I love the texture and there is a generous amount of them. There's nothing like having this drink on a hot day. I'm craving one right now! I also always use the app to get more rewards. My boyfriend got some mango drink, which was too sweet for my liking, but the mango jelly was delicious!"
773,AgBuPYM74--2L8XIuXcS8w,10/7/2021,4 star rating,"Options for bubble tea are pretty limited in the area - you only have Kung Fu Tea, Vivi and Gong Cha which is a decent walk away from the other two. I think KFT is decent in this location. The workers are highly receptive to your preference in regards to ice and sugar level. The actual store itself is small, but they do have a good system in regards to social distancing. When you order and get your receipt, you wait outside of the store and your number is called in from the speakers in which you then go inside to receive your drink.With the KFT app now, you can also use it to get some deals and cheaper boba. I would recommend the rosehip milk tea, oolong milk tea and red wow milk.Overall, this is really nice, affordable and quick place to get your bubble tea. Would recommend!"

There's this one time when a new clerk made a black tea with herbal jelly (tasted so bad), took one sip and I returned back. Manager gladly exchanged another drink for me without issue. Since it's a franchise drinks are mostly the same everywhere else. Customer service at the Sunset Park location lacks a bit of that. Really enjoyed my drinks here."

778,TgoYhgbPCYhLBNtpue3QHg,3/25/2023,4 star rating,"Absolutely LOVE brunch here, but they seem to have gotten a little more uptight. We used to come to brunch here all the time, always with a large party, because we love that the food and drinks just keep coming and it's all settled in the bottomless. This time we felt we had to ask for so much. We sat without food for some time and we had to keep asking for drinks. It was pretty disappointing especially because they're so strict about their time frame. They also used to being the pitcher and refill our drinks and now they clear your glass and you have to wait for a new drink. It's definitely an elevated addition to their service, but they kept miscounting and forgetting drinks. It was uncomfortable because they kept counting our glasses at the table like we were trying to get one over on them. All in all we like the food and the option for bottomless, but don't love the new changes in how they do the bottomless. The drinks were yummy but we had to keep waiting for them. Staff is very friendly, and we appreciated them letting us take our time finishing our last drink and not rushing us out after we paid the bill"
779,TgoYhgbPCYhLBNtpue3QHg,3/6/2023,4 star rating,"Came with a group of 13 people to do their bottomless brunch (food and drinks) and it came to $78 per person (including tax). For the variety of food but especially drinks, I thought it was a pretty decent deal. They started by giving us a sampling of the menu which they served in waves. We also ordered some other items off the menu, however they are quite slow in delivering any other item that you order. The carnitas tacos, the corn on the cob, churros, and plantains were my favorites. The vegetarian tacos were my least favorite - they were pretty wet in texture. They have a pretty extensive list of drinks that you can order off their bottomless drink menu, this includes a variety of mimosas, margaritas, bloody mary's, and bloody maria's. They are not shy with their pours either and were very on top of making sure our glasses were filled. They were very accommodating in adjusting our reservation size multiple times. For a group larger than 12, they do want you to contact the restaurant directly. We ended up adding one more person to our table at the last minute and they were extremely accommodating!"

Don't think Maya will be around for much longer.Service is fine, polite enough, I suppose. Didn't appreciate how the happy-hour prices were only available at the bar. There was no seating at the bar, and we were led to our table in the restaurant early. They should have honored the happy-hour prices in the restaurant, which was eerily empty for a Friday night. Truly stunning to see.NOT RECOMMENDED."

It can get a bit loud with 20-somethings boozing and brunching here, but it's the spot to go to if you want a great bottomless deal.  Service was good, although it took a bit to get the waiter's attention as the place is always crowded.

Some of my favorites was carnitas tacos, chicken fajitas, corn on the Cobb and churros but everything else was good too. Service was pretty good. They kept on refilling our drinks in a timely manner. Our reservation was at 2pm but we were served until 4pm which is nice since I think the bottomless is typically 90 mins. Atmosphere was alright too, it was pretty busy. They can work on decor if I'm being honest since I didn't see much of it but would still come back for the great food!"

The place was very roomy, well lit, and nicely decorated. We ended up doing the a la carte menu instead breaking bank on the AYCE. The dishes looked scrumptious as they were passing our table! We shared some guac which was plenty for the two of us but there was nothing special about it. I ended got the full plate braised short rib enchiladas and the serving size was a bit too small but the sauce and tenderness of the beef was spot on. The service was very attentive and polite. Overall, enjoyed my experience!"

However, since the pandemic, I think the brunch deal has become much more reasonable; what a deal it is! $55 PP for all you can eat Mexican tapas and drinks. Drinks include bloody Maria's, bloody marys, margaritas, and mimosas of several different flavors. Drinks are stronggg and well made! The food is the real star, however. The options are endless. Our server offered the full menu to start- which included about 15 different tapas with thoughtful flavor palates.Some of our favorites were the ceviche, chilaquiles , lamb tacos (**omg so yum!), hot dogs, and chips and salsa. Service was super kind and speedy. I am very impressed by the retail space- really big for this area! Will definitely be back!"

They had other foid offerings and honestly, none were any good.Speaking specifically of the pizza, I didnt like it then and I feel the same now.The pepperoni slice was a total rip off in price and add in a soda to the bill and its beyond a ripoff, perhaps I'm a bit cheap, but not if the taste and quality justify it.The slice was large and tasted fresh but the taste totally lacked. The mozzarella cheese was totally boring and bland, the sauce had flavor but thats all you taste, inexcusable in NYC. This is mall pizza not unlike DiGornio pizza you buy at the grocery store."

They have a big sign that says you have to pay a 4% fee to use credit cards. Ridiculous! Why not just add it in the food cost? 99% of merchants don't do this and most days, people don't walk with cash. #2. If you take one piece of oxtail, they charge you the $10 and change extra on top of your food. I'm really fussing for nothing, because I'm still going to buy food there. Lol"

First problem I had, considering it was my first time visiting was there was no labels or names for the food on the buffet except for the oxtails so it's like they expected you to know the Jamaica cuisine. It wasn't much on there I wanted and they didn't even have plantains. Plus the pricing was different for different things on the buffet also super confusing . I checked out up front and they weigh the food and I grabbed a water and a fruit juice . Remind you there was no pricing for those items . My juice ended up being $5 but wasn't worth it in my opinion. Wouldn't visit here again if in the area ."

The vegan one I went there the food was there you didn't even know what it was they had to tell you no labels the food was dried out. And what was not dried out was over cook rice cooked to kind soft as baby food, the Mac and cheese noodles were too soft macaroni should be aldante in between not soft, the fis made my aunt throw up. The food should be turnt, the girl at the register was not vegan no vegetarian did now know about the food. The vegan drum sticks was literally swimming in gravy and take like mush it's not meat why would it be sitting in gravy tofu yes not the drumsticks. The fruit was not fresh I feel they should have had plastic over it or a top to keep its juices.

I frequented this restaurant often prior to the COVID outbreak but have up until this day avoided buffet/self service places.As you walk in there is a hand sanitizing station and plastic gloves are provided and required to be used when getting food from the buffet.Word to the wise. Be careful when preparing your plate. I had two containers...The first had rice and peas, macaroni and cheese, cabbage, curry chicken and curried goat. 2nd small container has just rice and peas with curry chicken. This totaled $27+. When I questioned the cashier about the price she informed me that since I had curried goat on my plate I was charged more.  I get it, I get it! ...Those are the rules...which are in fact posted far away from the serving buffet way out of sight.  The upcharge was roughly an additional $2 per pound. Not worth it for the amount of goat that I got..but..I get it. These are the rules..Now about the food. Neither the curry chicken or goat had curry flavor. The rice was hard and also lacked flavor. I wasn't at all pleased with the experience or the food this trip. Will think twice before returning I must note that I had to pretty much scream to be heard because the music was blasting making it hard for us to hear each other.Tip: Turn down the music a couple of notches so that you can provide attentive customer service Also: have a sign posted NEAR the items that have and upcharge so that it is clear to the patrons of how much they may be charged."

This place has a plethora of meats, veggies, starches, and just about anything your heart desires. The staff is super friendly if you need to know the ingredients of something, they'll be more than happy to tell you. If you have allergies they will be happy to help you out and tell you which dishes to avoid. My husband and I walked in there wanting to get some lunch, but we walked out with lunch, dinner, snack, dessert, and breakfast, lunch, and dinner, for the next day. We just couldn't make up our minds because there were so many incredibly looking things in our face. Which is a great tactic for people like me who love food and want to try a bit of everything. And they're more than happy for you to take a little bit of almost everything with you.  More of a take out place them a sit down place so keep that in mind. But the food is delicious.

I will say though, that their lunch/dinner menu has an extensive selection to choose from (not saying anything bad about their breakfast menu), so brace yourself.

Very unprofessional and a danger to everyone working there.The managers were belittling the staff to watch out for the kids and it just made it an uncomfortable experience and even more terrible since the food was so crappy.For $14.03 I shouldn't have been lazy and just picked up a burger at the diner across the street and saved myself the money and aggravation.Save yourself and avoid this Wendy's at all costs."

I don't go often but when I do then never can get the order right. The manager packing the food is always on an extreme rush. I get they are busy but you can slow down just a little bit to provide a decent amount of customer service. If I ask for sweet and sour sauce, I'm guaranteed to get honey mustard. If I ask for chili sauce with my chili I'll get crackers with no sauce. It's not brain surgery here.. just take 2 seconds to listen. And it's always the rushing manager that makes the mistake & she always acts annoyed if you ask for the correct item. This time I didn't even bother. I'm done with this Wendy's."

I was here maybe 2 years ago and it was like a little fancier pizza shop and it still has that look.The only think I don't like that they put out too many tables for that place. I have been in that place in different times of day and I have never seen it full so that every chair is taken. They should defiantly rethink the tables situation, but otherwise it's a very good place for any meal of day.(It's only dairy and it's kosher)"

Even if you provide a poor product and don't deliver on time I'll let it slide... I won't order again but I won't usually call you out. However if you blatantly LIE to me then we have issues.I ordered on Seamless at 11:26am and was given a 45-60 minute delivery time. Over an hour and a half later I called to inquire about my food and was told it would be there ""any second"" and that the guy had left. 10 minutes later they called me to tell me it was on the way. This confused me since someone on a bike would have been there in the time since they had last told me that it was on the way. Almost 40 minutes after I was originally told it had already left they finally showed up. In a car! So they lied to me not once but twice since the restaurant is a 6 minute car ride away. Then I taste the coffee which was terrible and had what tasted like a 3 scoops of sugar in it. I can't have sugar and never asked for sugar. The Panini was luke warm and sitting in a huge pool of oil. At least they didn't screw up a simple side salad. Lying to your customers is not a way to do business. Had they been honest and apologized I would have easily forgiven an over 2 hour delivery mess... but not when you lie to me twice."

The location of this restaurant is interesting, nestled under the towering BQE bridge off of one of the busiest, grungiest (dare I say ugliest) roadway artery running through brooklyn. The interior is meant to reflect this vibe inside. Industrial, run down, grey and utilitarian. It's a perfect cross of Gowanus Brooklyn and forgotten Tokyo. It is almost deliberate, and I'm here for it. Diner style grey seating - cozy and practical yet also comfortable. I loved that we were served water in stainless steel cups - clean and anti microbial, while delivering the message ""this space belongs to the people"". My friend and I both ordered the spicy gyukotsu ramen. The only condiment on the table was red chili powder. Perfect, because it is all I require. Food came out relatively quickly. A perfectly seared piece of short rib was on the Ramen bowl. It was fatty, it was meaty, and it was ABSOLUTE PERFECTION. The broth was a perfect temperature, the flavors perfectly balanced and layered - creamy?  umami?  savory? Complex? Corn added exciting texture and substance, the spicy chili oil added a little bit of sexy slick. The noodles were slippery and wavy, like a beautiful canvas forming the perfect background. This is one of the best Ramen bowls I've had in a while. What makes this restaurant amazing is not just the quality of the food but the experience. I felt like I walked in to a local spot in a forgotten neighborhood in Tokyo after a long rainy day of hard manual labor. The ramen hugged me like a mother. Comfort at it's finest. Please go here."

Probably the lowest component of the three. Noodles - 5/5. 17 minutes of thin noodles sitting in the broth, but maintain its firmness. I'm beginning to fully appreciate and embrace thin noodles now.Side notes:Unagi Pie - $10. Flaky and puffy. Sweet eel sauce glaze. Texture of the pastry overpowers the eel. Karaage - $10. Same as mines but crunchier. They definitely added a lot of seven spice to the mayo, which is a plus.Total - $52.26"

He gives it 5/5 but I'm knocking it down one because I think it's above average and a great go to but there are a couple other spots that i prefer for the same price. Also - my partner has ordered it to go and they dish it out very quickly and he enjoys it at home even though take out ramen is never as good as in the restaurant.

Za-Ya is one of the top, if not the top, ramen spot in Brooklyn and we were excited to try. I was intrigued by their beef broth ramen, as I've only had tonkatsu and vegan/vegetarian ramen.The interior is cozy and clean, with only a handful of tables. We were greeted upon arrival and thankfully there was an open table! We both ordered the Gyokatsu ramen, which is their signature dish. Service was attentive, kind, and fast. Before we knew it, our ramen was delivered to our table and we dug in! For the price, the portion is generous. I thought the beef cuts in the ramen were delicious and took the bowl to the next level. The ramen noodles were chewy and plentiful. The broth was definitely flavorful, but not as flavorful as I initially expected and I did not find it to pack the same punch as pork-based ramen. The upside here is that it left me feeling pleasantly full without the post-ramen sleepiness I usually get with heavier, richer broths.Za-Ya is definitely worth trying and I would come back to try the spicy gyokatsu ramen!"

Dont let the appearance fool you - It looks creamy but the consistency is still brothy. There are so many flavors cooked into the broth, the meat and the noodles, my mind was being blown with each bite. The service in here is excellent and the ambiance is cozy. I also tried the  kinpira duo app, which I had once before, and I think it's a new recipe. I kind of liked it better the old way but still worth getting if you want to try something new! I have also tried the tuna avocado app, which was a simple staple though the rice was served too hot which impacted the sashimi tuna. The ramen really stole the show here and it is worth coming to Za Ya to try their signature gyukotsu."

835,5EaTaKHxXtD5bTCVnbi2Xw,5/18/2021,5 star rating,"Za-Ya Ramen is a hidden gem located on Court Street next to a tire shop, just north of the intersection with Hamilton Avenue. The unassuming location seems like an odd choice for an impressive restaurant, but this humble hole-in-the-wall holds it down. I've visited twice now. My favorite starters are the ginpira and the karaage fried chicken, though there are plenty of other appetizer options. The beer and sake selection is also surprisingly good (fresh cans of Other Half and Folksbier for the win), and they also offer tea and soft drinks. The star of the show here is the gyukotsu ramen, a specialty that combines traditional ramen sensibilities with an infusion of Mongolian flair. The broth is rich and savory, the noodles are thin and hearty, and then there's the short rib, tender and delicious. This is an outstanding bowl of ramen that will satisfy any connoisseur.I've also tried the shoyu ramen, which is a few bucks cheaper and definitely more plain, if you will. Tastes like a good old-fashioned chicken noodle soup. If you're feeling under the weather, a bowl of this stuff will have you back in fair health. (Note: I'm not a doctor, that is not medical advice, I just believe strongly in the healing power of broth.)If you saved room for dessert, treat yourself to some mochi ice cream. There's also a kids menu in case there are hungry little ones in the picture. I am deeply impressed with this restaurant and I encourage you to give them a try, either for take-out, delivery, or sit-down dining."

837,FbPau2nmqt46skpre7de9w,10/14/2015,2 star rating,"Yellow Magnolia Canteen, located in the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, is a typical ""museum"" restaurant with fancy sounding sammies and salads. We stopped by while visiting the gardens and the place was packed. Outdoor tables with umbrella's shading the lucky few, are your seating option. You walk up to the cantina and order directly from the kitchen (after waiting in line). You can choose from a variety of options which all sounded fairly appealing: sandwiches, salads, soups and items for the kiddos as well. I chose the Sicilian Tuna sandwich and was less than impressed. Tough focaccia bread that is sliced terribly, causing you to get full bites of bread only or tuna to fall out because it's so thin in places. The tuna itself a very basic: olive oil and lemon dressing (but was there lemon in it?!) and there couldn't have been more then 1/2 a cup on the actual sandwich which made the dish very bread heavy. Your meal is served with a homemade pickled cucumber that was so incredibly salty it was inedible. Prices range from $9-11, which isn't terrible for NYC, but fairly terrible for the quality you receive. If you must eat at the Yellow Magnolia Canteen, I highly recommend avoiding the Sicilian Tuna sandwich, but better yet, just skip the stop all together and look for a better option in the area."

There is a ""sister"" sit down, indoor restaurant about 75 feet away.  Not sure if that is any better."

I know about inflation, but a chicken sandwich or garden salad for 16 bucks each is not ok when it's both small and mediocre at best. Coffee was weak and tasted like flowers, which I guess is appropriate for a botanical garden, but still gross. On a positive note, 3 cookies for $5 enabled me to leave for the Japanese Garden in a somewhat zen mood."

The roasted chicken was moist. The stuffing was hearty and delicious. The mashed potatoes were creamy, buttery, and smooth. It's very reminiscent of a home-cooked meal. The shepherd's pie was good. The potatoes were like the mashed potatoes from the roasted chicken. It had a cheesy taste. The lamb was tender. The dish was very filling. Sticky toffee pudding was too sweet. However, it was very fluffy and melted in your mouth. The ice cream made it a bit less sweet than on its own, but not something I would get again. The entire meal was very comforting and homey.

I have been wanting to dine here for a while after seeing great reviews so this weekend we made plans to come here and treat a friend for birthday brunch. We did show up early for our reservation and they managed to get us a table (this was nice and a win), however, totally regret it because it just went downhill from here. Food: 2 of us ordered the breakfast sandwich which is pictured front and center on the brunch menu looking fabulous with melted cheese and huge pieces of bacon, a nice toasted bun etc... we were literally drooling and both ordered this. Upon getting our food (which took forever, see service section below), I've never been so disappointed before. Literally was 2 pieces of barely toasted bread, cold unmelted cheese, lukewarm eggs and microwaved tiny pieces of bacon. There was absolutely nothing else to this sandwich that cost a whopping $17. Both of us looked at each other and died bc we regretted ordering this immediately. Hoping it would taste ok at least we tried it and suffered through watching our friend eat a burger which actually did look good (and tasted ok from the one bite that was shared with me).Service: HORRENDOUS other than being seated early and the host smiling at us. Super slow service, no one checked on our table throughout the meal, we flagged down waiters when we could even get them to look in our direction. We ordered beers to start, the server did not inform us that some beers come at room temperature so when we got it and were surprised he decided to then inform us that the beer is served at room temp and this is normal. We asked to change it out because it was not made clear - he did switch it for a cold beer. When ordering food, we asked to have fries instead of salad, our server informed us it was a $2 up charge and we were fine with this and said ok. When we got the bill and we were charged $9.50 for fries, I reminded him about the $2 up charge. Our server responded saying, that's what I thought it was but they told me it wasn't. WHY WOULD YOU NOT COME TELL US? Literally, WORST SERVICE and NO COMMUNICATION WITH US THROUGHOUT THE MEAL. Not only was this wrong, the beer we sent back was still on there and he didn't even change the $2 up charge on the fries.Needless to say, I am not coming back here, this place was terrible from start to finish and I'm glad I waited so long to come here bc there are much better places in the UES I'd rather dine."

No.When we were finally seated the manager offered a free round of drinks. However, our waiter was curt and lacked knowledge about the food.Food 0/5Not authentic We've experienced food in London and this was far from authentic British fare.The scotch egg was made with chorizo.....no no no.I ordered fish and chips, with curry sauce on the side. The fish was not fresh and the chips were not chips they were burned fries. The curry sauce didn't do the job, it was a caramelized pepper sauce not curried at all.We also had chicken and leek pie with onion gravy on the side.

We couldn't have been more pleased with the selection we made! The sounds that the food we had elicited from us were borderline obscene. (Thankfully, we were sitting outside in the covered area with no people at the time, so the public was saved from our noises). The condiments for the Yorkshire pudding and scotch egg alone were enough to want to write home about. I wish we could just have a jar of each of those to take home to put on every piece of bread and egg we have. Everything was cooked great, the only exception and thus the minus 1 star was the item we came for- the sticky toffee pudding. Although delicious, the texture was a bit dry and it was more cinnamon (maybe cardamom?) than toffee taste. It was still really good, just not what we were expecting. Overall, would absolutely recommend to go and try their food as we will most definitely come back again."

Always a great selection of beers, authentic British pub food, nice atmosphere. Last night, my wife and I returned for the first time since leaving the Upper East Side and to say I was disappointed is an understatement. The food has really taken a step back. My wife ordered the Fish and Chips which was bland, no side of lemon or Malt. The chips were extremely soggy and greasy, not a bit crispy, as if they sat for 15 minutes and steamed themselves. I got a foundry pie which was a staple in my diet back in the day, and it was decent. The mushy peas and mash had almost no flavor, and the bubble and squeak tasted 4 days old. They were also out of many popular beers, like London Pride, The Foundry Bitter, LIC Sour. I'd like to believe this was an off night, and I hope I can give them one more shot, but this was very disappointing."

We took to Yelp to find the best place to eat, and we landed on Jones Wood Foundry.We were happy to see that they take reservations, but it turned out that we really didn't need one when we arrived. We got there pretty much right after they opened.It's the cutest British pub! They have bar seating when you first walk in, and then they have some additional indoor seating, as well as a cute little garden patio. My friend and I ordered the hummus and the grilled cheese to share. The hummus came with three different flavors, along with some grilled pita bread. It was our favorite!We regrettably didn't realize what kind of cheese was in the grilled cheese, so we did not like it at all. But it was our fault for not knowing that it had a type of blue cheese in it.I would definitely recommend this spot for lunch or dinner! The pricing is fair. The grilled cheese was $13, and the hummus was $11. Most of their plates are in the $13-$30 range."

As others have pointed out, the food portions are small and the staff seem unhappy. The day that I visited, I arrived shortly after the store opened but the food was not yet ready to be served. I witness one girl doing all the set-up work while two others sat at tables eating. (Head nod to Ashely C.'s 1/17/23 comment that ""the entire staff was on break eating food like it was a Christmas party"". LOL) While Chipotle may allow workers free plates before the start of business hours, once the front door is open, the goal should be customer service/ revenue generation. The kicker? My bill for 3 skinny tacos was almost $19. Fun fact - if you ask for queso blano on your tacos it is considered a 'side' and priced at $2.95. I learned that at the register. The tacos were tasty, however, and place was clean. Maybe next time I will accept that big ole scoop of rice offered as my tacos' base. Less likely to leave hungry."
858,ejrmaeYJ98VNJn7AbxkcOA,1/17/2023,1 star rating,This spot always gives me some sort of issues. They always try and give such small portions and i have to tell them please put more because thats not even a full serving. I asked for avocado once and thats extra charge obviously and the worker literally tried to give me a spoon worth of avocado. Do NOT order online with this location because they'll give you the smallest portions possible while also rolling you the most ugly looking burrito possible. I also went into the store early and they told me we open at 10:45am and I get back at 10:47 and literally the entire staff was on break eating food like it was a Christmas party. The ONLY reason I go to this specific chipotle is because its by my job and there's nothing else but no more. I get its a minimum wage job and it's whatever but at least try. This spot is just terrible.

Ordering a Burrito from this location feels like telling your dad you forgot your cleats from soccer practice - that nerve wracking. The employee literally evil eyes me like she's getting ready to sock me in the face while making my food - then at the slightest exchange of words will basically yell at me all out . So weird dude .

Backstory: I placed a seamless order at another Chipotle for a large 10 person order and 5 minutes before it was supposed to arrive, the order was abruptly cancelled (turns out the location was closed with no warning or reason and I was never notified).  I had to race to this 67th street location to try my best to get the order fulfilled and not disappoint 10 hungry people!   The workers communicated with me that to best help I should fill out the order on the app and they would have it done within 15 minutes.  BAM! Fast, easy and delicious....and most of all everyone was so kind and understanding of what happened and how they could help.Thank you so much, I appreciate how hard you all work."

I arrived 10:33am (12 mins early before it starts) so I told them I can wait until 10:45am to make an order. Since it was raining outside, I sat inside the store. But two mins later, the staffs (the lady who I spoke to was there too) shouted at me staring and saying ""We are not starting yet"", so I left. They gave me a bad attitude. I always go this location for lunch. The service is always slow and the ingredients are much less than other chipotle places but I never complain because I love the food. But now I get really disappointed and will never ever come back again."

870,6SjQmcrk-0iXltDGzZV0MA,1/25/2022,5 star rating,"It's not just American Chinese food. It is very decent and have actual Chinese chefs. Not cooks. Chinese chefs that know their stuff. You can see the woks and feel the heat as you walk in. Now this doesn't make it that special, but it has a personality that is not found in other Chinese delivery restaurants. These chefs really bring the characteristic of where ever it is they came from in China. What makes this place a 5 star Chinese delivery spot is that all this quality (for delivery food) is done at an amazing speed. What's McDonalds? What's Dominos? What's chipotle? Those places claim to be fast, but I'd compare it to propeller planes vs a jet plane. You could order 20 items from the menu. Any other place would take over an hour before you get the notice the food is on the way. Here you can order 20 items and the food will be at your door before you know it. They don't hire taxi drivers to deliver no. They have the most skilled scooter driver in the city and sometimes I see someone deliver in a Tesla Model S. Business is good! Cause this place is an S-tier delivery joint."

I placed my order through the phone with their well known rude worker but I was prepared from my fellow yelpers about her attitude so it didn't get to me. We ordered shrimp fried rice with half fried chicken and a side of fries. The fries were not fried crispy so thats 1 star off. The bbq sauce had a weird taste so I just couldn't eat it but my greedy son did. I tasted a little of his rice and it was just ok. The chicken was too salty for me. My son was satisfied overall with his meal.

The hubster is obsessed with fried half chicken which is apparently easier to get in NYC. He wanted to share the experience with me as I have never tried. Apparently, it is a half a chicken that has been partially fried, then fried again once ordered. If prepared right, you get a crispier than average chicken which is moist and flavorful inside. He had been ordering delivery from this place for a while based on great word of mouth and a menu given to him. By the quality of the food delivered, he had imagined a nice sit down Chinese restaurant that offered delivery. He was surprised when we walked to the location and saw what looked like a Chinese fast food takeout storefront. However, our food was made to order and the place was busy with foot traffic the whole time there. We saw the delivery guy ride and park his electric scooter inside upon returning and waiting for his next delivery. The food was very good and nicely priced. I imagine we will be ordering from them on the regular."

I received the food where parts of my order were fine but the other half was not . There was black stuff all over my brócoli and it tasted spoiled so I threw it out and contacted grub hub . I was refunded and had no problem from there . I didn't want to go contact the testers it due to the fact that I didn't think it was a big deal and grub hub as a good refund policy with spoiled food . However I got a call from the restaurant interrogating me about my order . The women was hostile and rude and asked me why would I contact grub hub . Just for the sole purpose of how rude she was I will not be coming back to the place  anymore even if I enjoyed their food .

When I came here last weekend, I got a cocktail featuring a green apple and ginger flavor profile (I believe it may have been #4, but to be honest, I don'treally keep track since the menu changes fairly frequently). It was really good and very unique to what I've seen on other menus.My partner often gets one of their main staples: The BLVD, which features a peanut butter washed whiskey.As others have mentioned, they could use another bartender since drinks take a while, but honestly, the drinks are soooooo worth the wait, I don't mind. Service is always friendly (shoutout to Matt the bartender, who made our delicious drinks last weekend!).Ollie is among my favorite cocktail bars in the city and I highly recommend checking it out."

We also ordered some food which was good (but nothing super memorable) but you really come here for the drinks. Cocktails:I tried a bunch of the drinks. They're really good at making creamy drinks - I don't know how they make it so creamy and fluffy. #3 was one of these creamy creations with a light pandan flavor that smelled amazing! #6 was also really good and gingery - also very fragrant and creamy. #1 was a refreshing smash drink - very strong in flavor (and alcohol content) but it was also still very balanced.Food:- Cheese bread was so good - very moist and plenty cheesy and goes great with sour cream- Roast beef sandwich was also very delicious - very tender though maybe a bit on the salty side - Tuna crudo was very refreshing, I like the crunchy flavor from the radish and wild rice, the tuna was very fresh and I love the vinaigrette that came with it- Their brussel sprouts were a bit of a disappointment - it was a bit soft and not as crispy as most restaurant brussels. And you really need the fish sauce or else it's a bit bland."

You are not reading this review because if you are, that means it's real--and then you will also know about this cozy little cocktail bar on a nothing street in West Village.

And it might get too busy for us to receive free drinks and the undivided attention of our amazing bartender.Let's say hypothetically this bar exists. You might enjoy Cocktail No. 3 if you're looking for mild mezcal and cardamom. But I prefer Cocktail No. 5 for its gorgeous beet color, flavor and notes.

Mainly chose to come here because they had mocktails (and the mocktails were reasonably priced). It has a pretty laid back vibe--not quite a cafe but not quite a nice sit down restaurant. My one mocktail complaint is that the drink was 80% ice which is frustrating because you pay $10 and there's barely any drink in it. But it was really yummy and more than just a lemonade or a seltzer with some added flavor. Not sure I would come back, but think it's a solid option and nice to try!"

889,GoABwVqFoFiXL_sxNtzVQw,1/1/2023,4 star rating,I'm not vegan/vegetarian but have been intrigued by this place. First it looks really cute! A little bit of a tropical feel. You order at the counter. It was not clear where the line was supposed to start so an employee had to come over and tell everyone where to move to and stand (it was fairly busy when I was here for lunch). I was having a hard time deciding what to order since so many dishes appealed to me (this means I'll definitely be back!). I ordered the Tibetan mama. They put a good amount of the curry sauce in the bowl. The kimchi was good but not spicy (in case you're worried about that). My friend ordered the mezze. Not sure exactly what he was eating but it did not look as appealing to me.
890,GoABwVqFoFiXL_sxNtzVQw,12/5/2022,1 star rating,"I had extremely high hopes for this restaurant after reading so many reviews, but unfortunately this is exactly what gives vegan food a bad name. I ordered the green pea hummus and chili sin carne for takeout. The first thing I noticed once I was handed the bag was the smell. It was atrocious and unlike anything I have smelled before. Once home, I noticed I only received 2 small rice crackers to go with my hummus (which I guess is standard, but still small) and that the hummus had a bizarre smell and texture to it. Once I finally tried it, I threw it into the trash immediately. It had the most chemical and medicinal taste that was repulsive, I cannot even believe they would serve this especially for $9. The chili sin carne also had a bizarre smell to it, I can't even begin to describe. It smelled waxy and like I opened a can of chef Boyardee from the '90s. The dish itself was OK, but nowhere worth $17 as it was not satisfying in flavor or portion. Needless to say I will not be returning for overpriced, overhyped, and flavor-less food."

Clean interior, helpful staff, and both indoor and outdoor seating available. Not table service --- go to the counter and then take the test to your seat.They have a number of stews/soups that smell delicious but it was a hot day and I wanted something cooler, so stuck with the cold items. Gazpacho is seasonal and delicious. Smaller portion than the usual bowls but I don't think I would have enjoyed a giant bowl anyway. Jackuna was like tuna salad but without the brine of fish and with a softer fall-apart texture. Best if you're taking the tuna fish allusion as a way to understand the way it's prepared and not ordering because you want tuna.PB quinoa cookie was more like a hard tea biscuit, which I didn't mind. Ended up saving half for later. Quite like the extra texture provided by the quinoa."

The soup of the day that day was a variety of vegetables which included in addition to their spices: Carrot, cauliflower, possibly potato and squash.. I don't exactly remember I just know I needed my vegetables lol. To begin with upon entering the ambiance is great, will probably always be worth it... the service is awesome as well.. the workers are fairly young but they do their absolute best to always get you what you need.

They would also do better with more protein choices - fried tofu / seitan / nut butter / tofu skin / mixed mushrooms / kelp, there are infinite number of things you can do here...What was better than others:- Tibetan mama, a light curry- jackfruit curry - coconut ceviche - interesting concept but yes sourWhat was not good:- vegan chili.  I really think I can google for 10 minutes and find a better vegan chili recipe than this.  Too sour and reminded me of eating a can of tomatoes or pasta sauce.- the price - $7 for a kombucha and ~$15 for a bowl.Trendy ambiance though.  Full of beautiful and fit UWSers that make me want to eat healthier to look like them."

We were mainly there for the BBQ meat that is behind the counter, so it didn't matter too much. I had paella, cheese bread, maduro, pork sausage, 2 types of sirloin and bacon wrapped chicken. The meat is delicious! The cheese bread is so good but not enough were ready. The sauces available on the side of the counter are a great condiment.  We enjoyed the garlic one and the chili oil.Lastly, they allow people to sit too close to each other. We had people eating right next to us, no plexi glass in that spot. The staff is very nice!We will be back but we may take our food to go."

Despite the Brazilian dishes, this place offers healthy side options which is a big plus for people who are on a diet and still want to eat tasty food. Pastel de carne (beef empanada) is so good! We also like to order the Salmon with lemon and the Combination steak"

I must say, this place blew me out of the water with the size of their bagels and the perfect crisp to the outer part of the bagel. Depending on my mood, I either get a toasted sesame bagel scooped out with butter or the same bagel, scooped with scallion cream cheese. I opted to be a little adventurous today (it is laundry day after all) and go for the later. They scooped out the bagel perfectly and added the right amount of cream cheese. The toasting was perfection. Extra crisp on the outside while remaining soft on the inside.This place has to be a busy spot because they were low on bagels at the time we went (10:30 am) but they had what we needed. Their danishes looked legit too. Next time, I am definitely getting one. Their iced coffee was okay. I like bold coffees. You know, the type that shock you and make you have anxiety. Next time I will try their hot coffee. Their menu looked good too, especially for lunch. Eventually I will try this spot too. The facade of the establishment is a bit deceiving in the sense that it almost looks like a nail salon until you read the business name. Maybe its just me?Inside, the place is clean and there is limited seating. We just grabbed our stuff to go and ate at the laundromat, which worked out since our washers were done. Staff is very friendly and fast in an epic way!!! The price is right (cheaper than my go to place too!). Definitely pop in and give it a try. I think this is my new spot."

I have purchased a TGTG bag and it comes with about 10-12 bagels and they last me about 4 days and it highly enjoyed by my entire family. Would come here to purchase other things if in the area.
909,UcXNrGQqmBtd8f2Lfhhp2g,8/31/2022,4 star rating,Great price point but totally average taste-wise. I was able to get a lox and cheese cheese bagel with onions and capers for a few dollars less than Bagel Boy or Bagel Pub (although Bagel Pub does pile on more lox on their sandwich). My brother got the even cheaper lox spread on a bagel which he liked. The rest of the food seemed like Boar's Head meat and cheese sandwiches which I have less than zero interest in so I would imagine myself coming back here solely because it's near my brother's apartment and is cheap.

Picked up some bagels, whitefish salad, and a bunch of Boars Head meats and cheese. Everything was great, and the whitefish salad was fresh and great on an everything bagel.

They cook amazing and are really good and fast but this time I'm upset that I was at work starving and ordered me a bagel with cream cheese and bacon and after a couple bits it tasted weird and I opened the bagel to find something yellow. I don't know if it's egg or something else but that was it for me my breakfast went to the garbage. It was a waste of money and a big disappointment because they even forgot my drink.

The backyard seats are comfy for gatherings or working. Their pastries definitely serve as a guilty pleasure on your cheat day.Kouign AmannHighly recommended by the staff, I ordered it even I had totally no idea wt it is. It is actually originated in Brittany, France. It is as flaky as a croissant with a complexity of salty and sweet flavors. The puffy layers were drenched in buttery sweetness, and the outer layer was caramelised with crystal sugar. A must-try item that you shouldn't miss! Pasteis de NataI was shocked when I saw the actual size - it was much larger than how it looks in photos online! The Portuguese egg tart was filled with cranberries and custard fillings. The outer pastry was buttery with multiple dough layers. I believe it would be best enjoyed after reheat. Tuna Melt Sandwich (1/2) with Rocket SaladThe tuna tartare salad hit the spot well with toasted bread and the veggies were very fresh.Flat White w/ Oat MilkSweet pastries always pair well with coffee. My Recommendations:Kouign Amann, Pasteis de NataWorth Returning? YES DEFINITELY Follow @nyc.bgoo on Instagram for more honest food review!"

I just waited almost 15min for a sandwich and what came....half I tossed. The bread was untoasted,  the fillings were not throughout the sandwich but seemed like they were quickly thrown in, the pesto was not spread out, it was so haphazardly put together that I can't justify a higher rating."

You can tell their baked goods and pastries are made fresh! I got the 1/2 breakfast sandwich (w/o bacon), kouignn amann, and butter croissant. Their breakfast sandwich was absolutely delicious. I love that you can choose between half or a whole as many times I want both savory and sweet as part of brunch/breakfast. The half sandwich was the perfect size. The eggs are perfectly poached and you can also choose to have your eggs cooked differently! Oh and don't even get me started on the bread! The sandwich is made with a perfectly fluffy sourdough that was seriously impressive! The kouignn amann was very good (I compare all kouign amanns to my favorite - Dominique Ansel). I loved that the top of it was nicely caramelized and had a good crunch! The butter croissant was equally well-crafted and I can't wait to go back and try more! Don't let the front of the bakery fool you, they have a good amount of tables in the back, both inside and outside as well as outside in the front. I appreciated that the table were reasonably sized and comfortable, which is not always the case at NYC bakeries/cafes.Overall, a gem of a bakery if you're in the Park Slope area! Can't wait to bring my family here when the visit!"

I can't speak for the breads but the pain au chocolat was gummy, the quiche lorraine was soggy and served with an ice cold center (they did microwave it when I raised the issue), the sticky bun was mushy. My wife liked the avo toast. Although not as expensive as other places , but still not worth the price."
923,jQBKxlqsR0xuv-QCFwHX6g,7/14/2022,5 star rating,"I enjoyed coming here for their wonderful pastries. They also have a little sit down in the back. Their pastries are the bomb and so are their breakfast. I went with my husband, brother-in-law, and brother-in-law's boyfriend. My husband either got the turkey or the BLT, I can't remember. I got the 1/2 avocado sandwich with a side salad. The boyfriend got the french toast, and I can't remember what my brother-in-law got. I don't remember him getting anything. The avocado sandwich was amazing. You feel super full and healthy after eating it. I also tried some of the challah french toast - it was almost like a pudding consistency, it was that soft, but still really good. I recommend you come here to get pastries and maybe sit in the back or back patio and enjoy it in the sun. The line gets long here so get there early!"
924,jQBKxlqsR0xuv-QCFwHX6g,6/16/2022,5 star rating,"I stopped by for lunch today and picked up a Pasteis de Nata along with a BLT  (Pork Belly Bacon, Bibb Lettuce, Heirloom Tomato, Garlic Buttermilk Mayo). I've had a lot of BLTs in my life, and this BLT is definitely stands out as one of the best ones I've had: the thick-cut bread is toasted to perfection, there is a generous amount of crispy, well-rendered thick-cut bacon, the tomatoes are juicy, the lettuce is crisp, and there's just the right amount of mayo to keep the sandwich moist.The Pasteis de Nata was a great way to finish off the meal! The puff pastry was crunchy despite being in close contact to the eggy custard. The custard itself was not too sweet either! Definitely would recommend picking up this pastry if you enjoy egg tarts.If you're in the area, I highly recommend stopping by Simple Loaf Bakehouse for lunch."
925,jQBKxlqsR0xuv-QCFwHX6g,7/8/2022,5 star rating,I just recently visited this place this weekend and I can't believe it's taken me so many years to finally stumble upon this place!The shop is small but has decent inside and outdoor space. The bread is soo crispy and fresh. I'm a big fan of pulled pork and while it's not the best one I've ever had it does satisfy the taste buds. Very juicy and flavorful. The grilled cheese is also very cheesey with multiple cheeses (I couldn't discern which ones). The breakfast sandwich is classic ingredients in really fresh pair of toasted bread. Really the bread is the best part of each meal. Don't order too much because it definitely does not taste as good or do the food justice when you eat as leftovers! Take from me who tried.. the waffles looked really good ! I think will try next time I go.
926,jQBKxlqsR0xuv-QCFwHX6g,3/31/2022,5 star rating,"My gf who lives in Brooklyn swears by this bakery. Pastry selection is varied and the danishes are larger than my head! Very cozy bake shop that has extended and outdoor seating towards the back. Staff are very cordial and warm. Space is clean and brightly lit. Alot of local patrons. I got a breakfast sandwich (slightly greasy sourdough) but the fixings are amazing!!! They don't skimp on the avocado, are light on the bacon (how I like it), and they have halved boiled eggs which are warm and soft. If you dine in, slather on the hotsauce and ketchup! They have condiments in a large tray, self-serve  iced water, napkins, etc. I also got a blueberry danish. Danishes are usually not my thing but it was just so tempting! The bread is flaky like a croissant, very fresh! And the blueberry preserve is only slightly sweet so the berries themselves are at the forefront, flavorwise. Very easily shared with another person.I was really tempted by alot of the pastries - pasteis de nata (a staff favorite, filled with a vanilla custard that isn't too egg-y or sweet), the kouign aman, the CHOCOLATE BABKA!, and the poached egg and sliced pork belly pastry cup. I missed out on getting that pulled pork sandwich too!!!! I will have to come back again since I'm staying in the area. Prices for the pastries are very reasonable. Sandwich prices are slightly on the higher end. I also did not take advantage of their seasonal drinks but I definitely need to try the London Fog and Spiced Pumpkin Latte (so happy they have this off-season....would I still be considered basic?? Lol)."

That is SO racist that they have to mention the fact that they see Asians collecting recyclables to make a little extra money for themselves or their family. And I'm asian so that's just so disgusting to me. It's not the employees fault that he feels so entitled that he can do whatever he wants and gets mad for not being able to get a few damn dollars off a sandwich. Like how cheap and hateful do you have to be to write hate comments like that? I think he just hates his life so much he takes it out on people. I've dealt with customers like that and it's so disgusting. This person is straight up garbage and instead of this cheap ass person PAYING for the sandwiches he ordered, he refused to because he doesn't want to pay two extra dollars for a sandwich. HAH. THIS PERSONS A JOKE. These people are actually amazing and so nice and it's not their fault they can't accept coupons.

Takes you for a ride and leaves you at the curb satisfied. Refreshing to have this experience in Staten Island which in my view has lost the authentic culinary touch. This place will give you that nostalgic memory you've lived so long without. Try it and try it again. We went for the Lasagna Bolognese and Tartufato.Bellesima :)

Owner and staff were delightful and the food was so fresh and delicious. Cute little spot with 5 indoor tables so I'm thinking we may have to order takeout another night during our stay as I can imagine tables at this little gem are in high demand during the weekend. We enjoyed the Prosciutto and Fig and burrata appetizers, focaccia, Spaghetti Bolognese, tortellini with mushroom sauce, and Signature 4 cheese house pasta. All were outstanding! The pistachio cheesecake was also delicious. We are still taking about how great everything was. Couldn't imagine a better meal for our first night out in NY."

For entree we got the lasagne to share and it was so nice to have them split it into sharing portion for us.It was 2 days after my bf's birthday so i spoke with the host on the side and she suggested a nutella cream puff dessert! I did read alot about the Nutella cake but they sold out for the day already (we gotta come back to try it!) but the Nutella cream puff was amazing!!! Its like a nutella flavored mousse spread over cream puffs with a yellow light filling inside. We enjoyed it so much!

We were turned away by the owner because she was saving the tables. Let me just say the place was EMPTY! There is a total of 3 booth and 3 separate tables ALL EMPTY! she stated the tables were ONLY for dinner. She was worried about making money and not having the space available. So she decided her best business decision was to turned us away. 2 customers willing and ready to spend money. We sat in the car annoyed for at least 45mins and Not 1 customer went in to buy dinner!!

The worker scanned my code, and explained it would not work and I owed money- I explained that she had taken it from my points to which she began arguing with me that I selected the wrong option and could not use my points. I asked if I could then just change my order to a cold brew to which she REFUSED to do and said that there was a line (mind you she was using two registers to take on more people, meaning she kept ignoring me to assist more people). The manager eventually came over and offered to change the order but after 5 minutes of going back and forth, the bean water just wasn't worth it anymore and I went to THINK coffee for my caffeine fix instead.

Ordered the massaman curry with chicken and a chicken pad thai. Both were very good, the massaman curry lunch special was $9.50 and came with two spring rolls and a side salad. Only thing I wish they did was to add more curry sauce. There was a lot of chicken, few pieces of potatoes but not enough curry sauce. The pad thai was definitely not lunch size and it was $8. One of the cheapest pad thai in the area!"

I ordered an order of pineapple fried rice and calamari. The total was 16.90. 8.10 was pineapple fried rice, 7$ for calamari. I paid for the delivery and went back inside my house and looked my food. I was baffled to see that I had LESS THAN HALF A BOX of calamari. (9 pieces to be exact) They weren't even big pieces. I was completely baffled so I drove to the store to complain.  I went in and told the front lady about my problem. She said that's how it's suppose to be. I was only suppose to get ""11"" pieces. I told her I counted 9 and she said in these exact words ""Sometimes it's this little"", I was completely shocked by this. What do you mean ""Sometimes it's this little""???? I didn't want to argue anymore so I just asked for a refund. She gave the refund and she had the audacity to tell me to get out and never order from there again.

The waiters were probably so busy, but still made sure to accomodate for us, like when we wanted multiple accounts of hot water. I got the Norwegian Benedict ($19), which tasted standard. The runny poached egg with the muffin was delish, although the Smoked Salmon was lacking and could have used a condiment on there. The Mesclum Salad was well dressed, and the Home Fries, not very crispy but well seasoned. They had a salsa tasting spin to them with the peppers. The brunch menu was pretty limited, but the food looked and tasted pretty good! I'd say David's is a great option if you're in need of a quick brunch with friendly service in the area."

Not bad for a Sunday brunch.A few of us ordered the crab cake Benedict, the fried chicken sandwich, and the steak and eggs. We also ordered coffee and tea but that NEVER came. I really needed some tea/caffeine to help reduce a headache I had. Someone in our party paid without checking the bill and it was too much of a hassle to dispute it. The mimosa pitcher did come though. I was pretty peeved since I really needed that caffeine. Also it's very loud in here. Our seating was right at the door and I was a bit worried with how close we were sitting by the door where people were waiting for seating. It didn't end up being an issue but just be wary of that. The food itself was actually really good. I enjoyed my steak with the chimichurri sauce and the sunny eggs. The home fries were pretty good as well but I would have preferred the skinny fries. The men in the group didn't seem to be full after their meals though, but the ladies were. Overall it was a good brunch, just a bit loud and they missed my caffeine."

I chose outside and they have overheat heaters so wasn't cold.The they have a few Benedict options, I chose classic and grabbed a coffee, but I saw the burgers, pancakes, and French toast coming out and they all looked great too.Eggs Benedict was literally perfect- eggs perfectly poached, Benedict sauce no weird flavors and decent portion. Salad had nice vinaigrette, and best of all, I normally hate home fries (either undercooked, or greasy, or way too much paprika) but these home fries were delicious and I finished them all. Well cooked, crispy and great seasoning.Service was great and I got asked if I wanted a refill of coffee before I left (I took a half cup because the coffee was great too).Happy surprise for a randomly picked spot- thank you yelpers!"

I'd recommend having a reservation because like all places in NYC during brunch, this place gets popping. They have a decent amount of seating indoors and a few tables outside, but the seating is pretty compact. I ordered D's Fried Chicken Sandwich ($17) and the Orange Blossom Pancakes ($15) for the table. My only complaint about the sandwich was that the bun was too thin and my sandwich was falling apart. I would've preferred a thicker bun like a brioche. My friends and I loved the pancakes though. They had so much flavor to it we barely put any syrup on. TLDR: Try the Orange Blossom Pancakes!"
975,3V20VbC45XL4TBYTL9DrOg,5/8/2022,3 star rating,TLDR: poor service upon entry but food was decent. Arrived at David's upon opening at 11am on a Saturday with a reservation. There are some people seated but there are still a bunch of empty seats. There is a line of around 7 lined up down the skinny hallway but no one has addressed us at all. I don't mind waiting due to short staffed ness because I get it demand can be high but at least acknowledge to your guests you will be right with them and have some form of friendly customer service. I even asked a server if we could get seated since we had a res and he was very rude and made it seem like I was in the wrong for even be asking to be seated. We get seated 18 minutes post our reservation time in a separate section. The next waiter was nicer but still forgot my drink and took awhile serving. The food itself was good very generous portions. I had the croque madame and the hamburger! The hamburger reminds me of McDonald's with American cheese which I love this type of burger actually but higher end! The croque madame also was pretty good. Both dishes were more Americanized so don't expect authentic French since they both came with French fries but I really did not mind. Not sure if I'd come back for the service: may try a to go order in the future!

Not only is their food affordable, delicious, and of the best quality possible--they are also exceptionally kind. That's the long and short of it. The people at To Be Thai make it that extra-special place in the community. Patrons who frequent the restaurant fall in love first with the food, then with the warmth and kindness of its owners and chefs. I love their pad thai, their wings and basil fried rice, their crispy duck salad, their bubble teas. They have something for everybody. I certainly recommend To Be Thai, especially after a long day of work...you don't feel like cooking? Call To Be Thai and order some comfort food, good for your soul and your body."

You can customize it however you like with their seasonal ingredients. It usually costs me about $16-$18 depending on how many premium toppings I add. The apple and mint leaves are my must-add toppings and they give a cool summer ambiance. The toppings to base ratio is well-balanced. For my base, I like a mix of romaine, spinach and quinoa. All ingredients are organic and fresh! There is a bowl for you no matter your dietary preference.Staff are super sweet. One offered to wrap my bowl with receipt paper (they didn't have tape haha) because I told her I was walking a long distance with it."

This West Village Sweetgreen location was open with modified holiday hours. This is a clean, well-organized Sweetgreen location with shelves at the front for easy pick-up; they also have a board that lists where the ingredients are sourced from. I love their warm Harvest bowl, which has the perfect salty/sweet flavor profile with goat cheese, almonds, roasted sweet potatoes, and apples. The salad had a generous serving of tender, juicy chicken. The rest of the salad seemed to be smaller than I remembered -- maybe Sweetgreen locations are cutting back given inflation. I also requested light dressing, and unfortunately it was overdressed. I reached out to customer service about the portion size and dressing, and they were kind enough to compensate for the experience. A+ for Sweetgreen customer service."

This occurred a full 50 min before they were scheduled to close. My question for sweetgreen is, where are your patrons supposed to sit for the next hour? Disappointed to say the least."

He was super funny and sweet! I wanted the Kale Caesar, but asked to substitute the parmesan, and he was happy to do so. He allowed me to include broccoli, onions, and beets instead at no extra cost. I also replaced the Caesar dressing with the sweetgreen hot sauce, and took some black and red pepper to go. All in all, it came out to be fewer calories, dairy-free, and healthier than what was originally on the menu, so I am thankful! The salad itself was fresh, filling, and delicious. I will definitely be back to try their other preset ones, but bet I'll be making substitutes, since they gladly allow you to! Yes, it's expensive and it's not as big as I expected, so I won't be going back regularly and it'll be my treat to myself every now and then. But I appreciate that this exists by school, the ordering process wasn't as complicated as I thought it would be, and that it's clean, quiet, and bright inside."

1002,l_jZX0IQqHzCwC_7KcKS7A,5/11/2021,3 star rating,"Had some drinks at The Owl Farm on Friday evening. They have a solid beer list and friendly staff, but I just was not a fan of the grimy space. Quality: The Owl Farm is a dependable beer bar, but it lacks a true draw. They have a good size tap list, it had fifteen beers and five ciders on it during out visit. It was also a good mix of local beers as well as old world beers, though I felt the actual varieties could have been more exciting. They also have an impressive list of cans and bottles, for those not moved by any of the beers on tap. And for non-beer drinkers there were a few wines and cocktails. During my visit I tried two beers and two ciders, Woodstock Baby Dragon and Saison DuPont, and then Phonograph Greening and Blackduck No Pasaran. The highlight of that group was the Phonograph Greening, a lighter cider with a beautiful balance. Quantity: The menu clearly delineates the size of the pours.Value: $10-$12 for standard Draft Beers and Draft Cider Pours. There are a ton of options, so it can vary widely if you are selecting bottles, cans, or specialty beers.Ambiance: The Owl Farm is located in Park Slope along 9th Street. Currently they have a few tables outside, but the busy area is not really a spot I would choose to sit outside. Inside they have a fairly large bar with some spread out stools, high-tops adjacent to it, and some tables behind that. The area with the tables also has a fireplace, and in the far back are several pinball machines. It is a very dark bar, and it has more of a dingy and dirty vibe than I was a fan of. It seemed to be trying to get that cellar feel, but it felt forced. There were also unfortunate smells that would waft through the bar every so often, similar to cleaning chemicals. It was especially bad in the back, but clearly made an impression across the bar.Crowd: It filled up relatively quickly on Friday evening. All the bar seats were taken as well as those outside, and the back seating area was becoming popular by the time we left.Service: The bartender was great, and was a lot more patience putting up with silly beer preference conversation than I would have been.Parking: Need to walk a few blocks to find a parking spot."

Long happy hour and plenty of deals besides, including a delightful selection of boilermakers. Pull up a bar seat and have yourself a time. Also, the bartenders are super chill. Full of interesting anecdotes, and also happy to provide information about the extensive draft list. The beer selection really is stellar. Being able to choose between 5, 10, and 16 ounce pours makes it easy to either sample several brews or load up on a specific favorite. There are pinball machines in the back. I recommend the Guardians of the Galaxy machine; fun challenges, and somehow easier to play than either the Twilight Zone machine or the Bride of Pinbot machine. Get change at the bar and have some fun. I like this bar and want to come back all the time."

I get royally annoyed by places that are pretentious, obnoxious, hipster joints, and despite the ambient lighting, this place is anything but. I've been here a handful of times with my brewing boyfriend who shares the same sentiment. He loves no frills, quality beer (not everything is a quadruple hopped colonial lactose IPA) with pleasant service and adores Owl Farm. And, our boy Jared is fantastic!! Everyone who's helped me has been pleasant but he's been there the last visits and LET ME TELL YOU. He has the sweetest, warmest personality and knowledgeable of beers and spirits without being a smart ass (actually doesn't exclude me from the convo when him and bf are yammering on and on about beer- what a gem). Also looks like Matthew Mcgorry from Orange is the New Black. Not Dane Cook."

Service was great, its a busy place but they're able to handle the influx of customers. Not sure what the difference bw pickup at the counter vs by the door is? The food is great - super filling and healthy with a base of rice, quinoa, or salads. The blackened chicken is flavorful, and the sweet potato is a great addition. The dressings are a little much - super sour or salty, next time id go light. Its nice that they mix it up for you."

Beautiful place with great food, but the employees ruin the experience.It was (clearly) only my 3rd time ordering here and so I was waiting on the employee to direct me/ask questions abt my order. It was around 5:50pm Monday 8/8/22, young African American man... I am not exaggerating when I say he was WHISPERING his questions, and then looked angry when I had to repeatedly ask ""what??"" It was infuriating. What are you doing whispering in a spacious store with AC and music on? Definitely seemed like it was purposeful.I asked for iced water and this guy looked at me like I asked for something he's never heard of. Overall he made this a really unpleasant experience! Will not be returning. I can go to any other sweetgreen with pleasant employees who are not going to make me so uncomfortable. NOT TO MENTION they only filled half of our ginormous bowl - this scam act is mentioned all over their reviews. ***The WILDEST PART? I came back to our hotel and shared this experience with my sister and she said she had an identical experience the previous day. So yeah, the employees purposely upset customers here, pretty much confirmed. It's just their thing I guess lmao. Will not return and will let friends and family know to avoid this location."

No wonder McDonald's stays busy and Burger King stays empty. Don't be conned by the 2 for $5 deal, you will be twice as disappointed."

Maybe your experience will differ if you order at the register?I got my food in a to go bag, but ended up eating it there. Clean dining room and Soul Town on SiriusXM playing over the speaker system. I don't need much more. Not a fan of NYC bathrooms where you need a code, so didn't check that out. Feel free to do so if you're up for adventure. If you like Burger King this will fit the bill.

My mother and son went here yesterday for the Tmobile Tuesday Whopper but didnt know you had to do the whole order on the app etc. No other customers in the store. Instead of just explaining what to do to my mother (or just taking the code off the Tmobile Tuesdays app as previosuly done at other locations) the cashier turns my mother away and says it cant be done. I was in the car waiting (no spaces) but i REALLY wish i was there. WTF are u losing by just taking the code?!?!? Acting like it cant be done when it can. Then this use to be my go to store for delivery but EVERYTIME i ordered, something was always missing or wrong in my order to the point where the last time I ordered from here (maybe June) i called up the store and spoke to the manager who was very apologetic but how are u guys STILL open?!?!? Customer service is HORRID and clearly VERY lazy. STEP IT UP! As you see many stores are going out of business in the area and theres a burger king up the block so your store wouldnt be missed (unfortnate for the good workers && manager)."

I paid $10 for a grilled chicken sandwich and a frappe. $10.The chicken was small and dry, the lettuce and tomato were practically non-existent. It was basically a dry chicken and cheese sandwich with a dash of lettuce and tomato. I guess the bun was good - it was a potato bun.The frappe was ok - but for almost 4 dollars i could have gotten just as good at McDonald's or maybe even Starbucks (ok maybe not Starbucks).Next time, I'll visit McDonald's or the Papaya spot across the street.

I think--from what I read--the menu changes and that could be true as I didn't see the Eggplant Parm on the menu.We started with the Farmer's Board which was really good.It included sea salt crackers (more like a focaccia style in my opinion) accompanied by very delicious vegetarian spreads such as red quinoa tabouli, kale harissa, spicy smashed sweet potato, avocado hummus, beets, grains of paradise. The spicy sweet potato was my favorite.For main we shared the Eggplant Parmigiana which was not too flavorful (average) and Red Quinoa plate with spring onions, broccoli di cicco, asparagus and heirloom carrots.

IMPRESSION: - This pizza is 3.75 out of 5 in terms of good pizza. It's not the best I've ever had in New York City (Pauli G's -- absolutely the best hands down)."

Pepperoni pizza is a staple for me - I love how smoky and spicy it is.There are only standing tables available in the Williamsburg branch, so I chose the outdoor dining area. I spent some time to take a ""decent"" shot so the pizzas cooled down a bit. Pretty sure it tastes even better if you eat right after it's being toasted. My RecommendationsPepperoni pizza for sure!

Once I saw this iconic place right in front of my face, no question about it. It was a typical pizza joint with no frills and just a hole in the wall. Well a huge hole in the wall. A slice is $3.50 which is similar to the other pizzerias in the area. Regarding the pizza, it wasn't anything spectacular. However, it wasn't horrible either. It was average. But if you saw the lines and people eating outside, across the street and inside it was like this was what you had to eat!! They're opened pretty late and won't run out of pizza either.

1061,rX8vNgg5QIm6cUkhV7wvWA,3/26/2019,1 star rating,"Today I went into the Starbucks in Staten Island on Bard Avenue. I visit this Starbucks almost every day that I work because it's close to my job. I always order an iced Venti Green Tea Latte. I do not understand how the Starbucks employees can not fill up a drink properly. This is the third time I've had this issue. I've asked the Barista's to fix it and instead they add more ice or just refuse to fix it because, as they've said, ""there's nothing wrong with it."" That does not solve the problem. I keep getting a drink with 3 inches of my drink missing. Today, I was on my way to work, picked up my drink and got back into my car. Right after I got out of my car to go into work, the foam from the drink had started to dissipate. When I got into work all of the foam has dissipated and there was almost a third of the drink gone!! Literally 3 inches of NO DRINK. What am I paying $5.06 for? This is the third time I've had this problem and I'm pissed. I'm a good member and I'm at Starbucks almost everyday of the week. I live in an area where everybody knows the people that come into the store on a daily basis. I do not understand the lack of customer service. I purposely mobile order so I don't have to wait in line. Do I have to go in, wait on line and tell a Barista (who should know proper measurements) how to make my drink. I'm mostly pissed about the fact that this has happened before and they don't care enough to fix it or correct the mistake for the future. I will not coming back to any Starbucks until they learn how to properly make drinks and actually care about their regular customers."

It is very cold in the establishment. I'm aware of the constant in and out foot traffic. However, the heat should compensate for it. Making time spent here uncomfortable if not prepared; I have to wear extra amount layers. The staff shouldn't have to wear winter accessories  to combat the the cold air entering."
1065,JAHAi7ll1YtN4wKFMdGawg,1/27/2023,5 star rating,"Gregory's my favorite chain (that feels more like a locally-owned coffee shop) in the New York/New Jersey area. Don't get me wrong, I will never not admit to loving Starbucks but if there's a Gregory's in the area I will always go there, even if it's a little bit pricier.There's many reasons but the top 2: CBD coffee drinks and superb vegan breakfast sandwiches that I typically order in the late afternoon when I'm my way to a work event. Years ago, I swore Gregory's strawberry CBD-infused latte about saved my sanity when I was trying to resolve the fact that someone had stolen my house closing costs from me while also leading a work conference at the same time. CBD lattes in the morning helped me keep my calm.This past holiday season they introduced the diving mistletoe kiss latte, which has peppermint, orange zest, oat milk (they always have an oat milk drink that you don't have to order special unless you're looking to switch to dairy. I like that) and CBD. So delicious! And in the pre Holiday season, AKA autumn, there's the Fall Oat Boy which depending on the temps, I'll get iced because it's that good iced.My favorite sandwich is the Vegan Deluxe which comes on a chia seed croissant that is unbelievably buttery and has Just Egg, Beyond Sausage and Daiya cheese. I also love their vegan BEC (something about that plant-based bacon is just so satisfying). The Beyond Flex comes on focaccia and is a bit more hearty. It's my understanding that there are so many dedicated plant-based options because Gregory, himself (yes, he looks like their logo) is vegan. And perhaps it's Gregory's presence and social media that makes this chain feel more personal than the others."
1066,JAHAi7ll1YtN4wKFMdGawg,1/7/2023,4 star rating,"Ordered:Nu Brew (~$6): cold brew & Nutella with milk (half & half)Aya's take:Honestly, I feel like the only New Yorker who hasn't tried Gregory's yet - until now! They have quite a solid drink selection but somehow I gravitated towards the Nu Brew. It was exactly what I expected - creamy, sweet, and caffeinated.

1075,JAHAi7ll1YtN4wKFMdGawg,1/27/2023,5 star rating,"Gregory's my favorite chain (that feels more like a locally-owned coffee shop) in the New York/New Jersey area. Don't get me wrong, I will never not admit to loving Starbucks but if there's a Gregory's in the area I will always go there, even if it's a little bit pricier.There's many reasons but the top 2: CBD coffee drinks and superb vegan breakfast sandwiches that I typically order in the late afternoon when I'm my way to a work event. Years ago, I swore Gregory's strawberry CBD-infused latte about saved my sanity when I was trying to resolve the fact that someone had stolen my house closing costs from me while also leading a work conference at the same time. CBD lattes in the morning helped me keep my calm.This past holiday season they introduced the diving mistletoe kiss latte, which has peppermint, orange zest, oat milk (they always have an oat milk drink that you don't have to order special unless you're looking to switch to dairy. I like that) and CBD. So delicious! And in the pre Holiday season, AKA autumn, there's the Fall Oat Boy which depending on the temps, I'll get iced because it's that good iced.My favorite sandwich is the Vegan Deluxe which comes on a chia seed croissant that is unbelievably buttery and has Just Egg, Beyond Sausage and Daiya cheese. I also love their vegan BEC (something about that plant-based bacon is just so satisfying). The Beyond Flex comes on focaccia and is a bit more hearty. It's my understanding that there are so many dedicated plant-based options because Gregory, himself (yes, he looks like their logo) is vegan. And perhaps it's Gregory's presence and social media that makes this chain feel more personal than the others."

The chicken avocado sandwich was ok and tasty mostly because of the  sauce. The buffalo one was just bread, cheese and some sprinkles of onions and chicken.

The chicken sandwich did not taste ""fresh"" and was lukewarm, the piece of bread accompanied with the corn chowder looked like it was ripped off or leftover from someone taking a bite,  hard to chew due to being stale like the tortilla chips.

He was more than happy to talk us through the wine list, offering recommendations based on our preferences and what we planned to order, letting us taste those recommendations (with generous pours), before we settled on a certain glass.Their wine list - both by the bottle and by the glass - is extensive with lots of unusual, funky wines (which I love), as well as your standard fare.The food menu is very creative and the portions are substantial given the caliber of restaurant... we ordered 7 dishes - 5 tapas-sized, 1 larger, and 1 dessert - all to share and my partner couldn't finish one of them (as much as she would have loved to!) because she was so full. Caveat - we don't have the biggest stomachs - but still, I think we ordered more than enough. The flavors were well-balanced and super tasty! Nothing too heavy or light, and each dish complimented the next.The menu changes regularly and they also have ""specials,"" which we learned were just dishes from their lunch service lol. Still, very good! It's pretty dark/intimate in the restaurant hence the dark photos.We ended up dining for like 2.5 hours or so... definitely doesn't seem to be a time limit! (Again, don't know why the host had to say anything at the start). Loved every second of it.Definitely a special occasion-type place. Will absolutely return!"
1116,Orbsfc3nI21mQ8cwSPahhg,3/29/2023,4 star rating,"Side note: The main ingredients stay the same on the menu but the pairings appear to change so my description of the dishes might not match. Small pricey plates reminding me of some other tapas spots though I prefer a certain other ""non-kosher"" spot in Brooklyn as it's more reasonable. In general, the bread is very good and worth it. We also liked the Spanish Mackerel and pricey but solid Jidori Chicken. Skate Wing and Salt Cod Fritters were fine. The Fried Sweetbreads weren't worth it for the price. Very good wine selection.I was at this crowded restaurant with my usual group around a month or so ago. The staff was friendly and it was a bit warm inside but not too warm. As this is known as a wine bar and I like Greek/German wines the most, I went with the Markogianni 'Vorias & Helios' Assyrtiko Ilia 2021 which was $18. This ""orange"" wine (or skin contact) was outstanding with notes of bitter fruit and some dryness. They also had a good mix of nonalcoholic drinks such as some mocktails also sold at Boisson for somewhat similar prices as well as some kombuchas and other things. We started with the Warm House Bread with Rodolphe Le Menuier butter which was $10. While I do not like the common trend of paying for fancy bread, this was worth it. The warm bread baked in house reminded me a bit of rye with a nice texture and the fancy butter (or rather Beurres de Baratte) had a unique slightly salty flavor. Soon arriving was the Salt Cod Fritters with chermoula and pimentón de la vera ($15.) Consisting of I believe 6 pieces, the fritter flavor was alright. I couldn't really taste the salted cod (or bacalao) and the paprika was subtle at best but it had a good texture with the transformation really coming from the sauce. Chermoula is a Moroccan sauce similar to chimichurri with fresh herbal flavors and it paired nicely (but would have paired nicely with just about anything.The Skate Wing with celery root, remoulade, and dill for $18 was alright. The fry was light and the remoulade went well but this was essentially a fancy fish and chips minus the chips. I probably wouldn't recommend it.The best dish soon arrived which was the Spanish Mackerel with mushroom escabèche, aioli, and pickled wakame for $26. The slightly fishy flavor was well offset by the the pickled seaweed and the sour mushrooms. The aioli added some good richness. I would recommend this heavily.The Jidori Chicken with caraflex cabbage and curry butter for $42 was the most expensive dish on the menu and would work as a sole main if someone was here alone and didn't want to try two/three of the small dishes. The chicken was soft and flavorful and went well with the cabbage (which is the notably same fancy variety used at 63 Clinton.) The butter could have used a stronger curry flavor but it was still a solid dish.The Fried sweetbreads with sunchokes, rainbow carrots, and piri piri for $35 was one of the few misses. The salad on top didn't go well with the sweetbreads which couldn't be seen as there was well so much of the salad. I think a bigger plate would work better with the sweetbreads severed on the side (as essentially a fancy offal version of steak frisee.)This is a difficult to get into restaurant for a variety of reasons. It's small and popular and the food is good with an outstanding wine list. Nice staff as well. Would go back."

It was a brisk Friday to MlK wkend and we arrived at 12:20 lucky enough to get two seats at bar without reservationBartender was super patient with our wine selection process and we shared the scallops (good but not easy to share and too pricey), butternut squash toast (perfect and you must order) and the fried chicken (delectable, boneless and comes with greens).

The service was really good and professional, and the staff shared great recommendations. Would recommend getting a little bit of everything and sharing, as the portions are quite small. Small plates but definitely big flavors. My favorite was surprisingly the celery salad: it had walnuts, dates and mint which went really well together. The scallop was DELICIOUS- so soft and melts in your mouth. Sweetbread was really good as well. The ambiance was great, candle lit and very friendly staff."

I think if I had been there at another time (not 11:30a) I would have enjoyed their wine selection more, but I do think people undersell the food here. It's definitely not a ""bonus"" as others may say and worthy in its own right. Service was great. The one ick was seeing a huge cockroach climbing up a wall near the bar... hence my 4 stars. Tip: highly recommend getting a rec! There was walk-in availability when I came (right at opening for lunch) but things filled up fast, so it's worth it to avoid any disappointment."

We came here without a reservation for an early dinner and were able to get seated at the bar right away. The bartender was delightful and gave us great recommendations for wine. One of my favorites was an orange wine that was light and delicious. The food is all mostly small portions that are meant for sharing and definitely on the pricier side. We ordered a flatbread with anchovies, yellowfin tuna, and clams with chorizo. While I thought everything was good, we left still feeling hungry even though the bill came out to ~$150 after tip and tax. Overall, still a great option for date night. I'd be interested in coming back since they change the menu so often."

Very soft, kind energy, wrapped in a bustling small blond-wooded space. If you know going in that this is a wine bar, primarily, with small plates where the cooking is top notch, you won't be left hungry (or spend too much). Everything we ate was interesting and delicous. Yes, it is expensive, and yes, I don't think anything equals a ""dinner"" in its breadth, but it does what it does very well. The servers were very informed about wine, I tasted several glasses, loved each one. The service, overall, is thorough and attentive. Happy to report the music perfectly matched the vibe of the place. I have to add that in now bc on a recent trip to a coffee shop on Metropolitan, in Williamsburg on a bright sunny Saturday morning, they were blaring EDM. So glad TFH got it right!Another gem: the past midnight secret speakeasy next door, Night Moves, formerly Larry Lawrence, and still (I think?) known as Day Moves when the sun is in the sky.TFH also do brunch and lunch during the week! Absolutely make a reservation, walk-ins are tough here, given the size of the space, and its (deserved) continuing popularity."

I'd get this again.A couple of my colleagues got the black pepper tournedo, which is one big medallion-looking piece of meat that I might try next time.Complimentary bread again, which was nice-tasting French bread along with olive oil."

The overpriced food just doesn't meet expectations and certainly doesn't make you feel like the money spent was worth it in the end. Convinced they refill the flat water bottles with tap. I'd ask them to bring the bottle unopened. The steak can never be cooked right. It's either too rare or overcooked. Complain about it and watch the eye rolling and even denial that anything is wrong. Sorbet desert is straight up sugar. In other words, disgusting.  This isn't fine dining. This is what I would call a fine dining price tag with a diner-esque experience."

I'm pretty comfortable here both w friends and by myself.Oh, and there's a jukebox!!! I love to jam out to old 90s hits and enjoy a gin & tonic. Overall, I recommend this spot.

We tried two drinks: the jelly latte with red bean topping which was delicious and tastes like nostalgia - it reminds me of the red bean ice cream we used to buy from the Chinese grocery store back in the day. We also tried the passion fruit green tea which had a very rich, premium passion fruit flavor that I love. The drinks are priced reasonably and are actually cheaper than other boba stores I also frequent like Moge tee and Coco (where daily trips can make you go broke - confessions of a bobaholic).

We were happy that the sweetness of the green tea could be adjusted to 0%. There are certain drinks, like the Brown Sugar Pearl Black Tea Latte, which can't adjust sweetness, but the drink I had here was not too sweet, so it was perfect.I would definitely come back for another quick bubble tea run!

They do have many choices to choose from and also seasonal drinks. The best drink I had was their mango pomelo drink that they had in the summer time. It's like a traditional asian mango pomelo dessert but in a cup version. It was pretty good and not overly sweet. Recently had their brown sugar pearl latte. It is fixed sugar amount and cant be adjusted. It wasn't overly sweet and their bobas were chewy. The store is small since they blocked off a good half of the area bc of covid. Overall, a good bubble tea shop to grab a hot or cold drink."

I've also tried their matcha latte which I like and the mango pomelo one. For some reason this brown sugar drink didn't hit the spot like the one I tried in Chinatown. I feel like the one I had in 8th Ave was less sweet but overall still good.
1164,IfrcwfLkoaCc7l8E3iToig,8/4/2019,4 star rating,"Will definitely come back and try their famous brown sugar bubble tea, but for now I wanted something light so I stuck with fruit drinks. When ordering you can customize the sugar level (less sugar) and ice level. I went with the Pineapple green tea. Despite ordering it with less sugar, the drink was sweet enough and had pleasant after taste. Surprisingly you can taste both - pineapple and green tea. The Green tea flavor was more pronounced when you initially take a sip followed by the fruity pineapple flavor. There's also small pineapple chunks at the bottom. Price -Fruit - 5 for a small, 5.50 for a large Clean, quick service. I lucked out and went during a period in the afternoon with no lines and was able to get seats."

1167,Gy29OVx8GSopkE-fcuF1kg,2/21/2022,1 star rating,I ordered two McGriddles 20 minutes prior to pickup . The lady telling me I ordered it after 11 am but on the app it literally doesn't let you order after 11am she must have not been comprehending properly . Went back and forth for 10 mins just to tell me I couldn't get it . People are so dumb sometimes and I'm very pissed because it's literally the McGriddle patty nothing else no egg no meat . And they couldn't get the order right . A bunch of Incompetence all around I'm very upset .

They're always forgetting something, the fries are soggy, the soda literally taste like seltzer water, or the staff are just giving you some kind of nasty attitude. This is where McDonald's and I part ways. This McDonald's needs a whole new renovation including a brand new management and staff. Has anyone seen the rats that are running outside in the drive thru area? Come on!!"

The food was the worst, the chicken tasted old not fresh at all.It had a weird taste to it .I didn't like it ,my wife was displeased with the chicken, just the worst.And the 4 dinner rolls for a dollar was a shame, the rolls taste like they have been sitting up there for about a year.

1177,PsDUAzWVfI1vEHstvI6LeQ,12/13/2020,4 star rating,"I have been to many fried chicken restaurants named Kennedy Fried Chicken throughout the years but this location is by far the best I have ever tasted. Conveniently located in South Ozone Park right on the very corner of the block in front of a parking lot it would be hard to miss. They are open from 10 am to 3am Sunday thru Thursday and 10 am to 4am Friday and Saturday. Please keep in mind that due to Covid-19 their hours may differ from the regular hours listed.The food here is really good having tried the fried chicken (leg, thigh and center cut breast), fried whiting fish, spicy chicken breast sandwich, french fries (with and without cheese sauce) and dinner rolls. Everything tasted fresh, well cooked with the right amount of fried batter for the chicken and fish. The french fries are consistently  prepared crisp with light oil, but I must say the cheese sauce was a bit salty and sort of cold for my liking. The spicy chicken sandwich is lightly breaded almost with a grilled appearance which was good considering the buns it comes on and those dinner rolls are warm, soft and simply good.I am guessing to some that you may be thinking... ""It's just a local fried chicken spot."" Well, let me say that if you try it, I highly feel that it will be one of the best you'll have.

I must tell you everything came so fresh, nicely packaged !!Fried whiting is a hit!! 5 pieces for $15 with fries and soda.

1226,PsDUAzWVfI1vEHstvI6LeQ,11/25/2021,1 star rating,"This has to be one of the worst chicken joints I have ever ordered from.I have passed by this particular restaurant hundreds of times over the years, but never went inside. So just the other day I said let me try my hand and check it out.I wasted ten dollars on 7 pieces of chicken. I couldn't get a 3 piece because you have to spend $10 or more using debit. The food was the worst, the chicken tasted old not fresh at all.It had a weird taste to it .I didn't like it ,my wife was displeased with the chicken, just the worst.And the 4 dinner rolls for a dollar was a shame, the rolls taste like they have been sitting up there for about a year. Like some of the people would say, if I could I would give this place zero stars.But the cashiers was very comical ,he said remember the dinner rolls aren't free ,they are 4 for a dollar, That made me laugh ."
1227,PsDUAzWVfI1vEHstvI6LeQ,12/13/2020,4 star rating,"I have been to many fried chicken restaurants named Kennedy Fried Chicken throughout the years but this location is by far the best I have ever tasted. Conveniently located in South Ozone Park right on the very corner of the block in front of a parking lot it would be hard to miss. They are open from 10 am to 3am Sunday thru Thursday and 10 am to 4am Friday and Saturday. Please keep in mind that due to Covid-19 their hours may differ from the regular hours listed.The food here is really good having tried the fried chicken (leg, thigh and center cut breast), fried whiting fish, spicy chicken breast sandwich, french fries (with and without cheese sauce) and dinner rolls. Everything tasted fresh, well cooked with the right amount of fried batter for the chicken and fish. The french fries are consistently  prepared crisp with light oil, but I must say the cheese sauce was a bit salty and sort of cold for my liking. The spicy chicken sandwich is lightly breaded almost with a grilled appearance which was good considering the buns it comes on and those dinner rolls are warm, soft and simply good.I am guessing to some that you may be thinking... ""It's just a local fried chicken spot."" Well, let me say that if you try it, I highly feel that it will be one of the best you'll have. Another note, all the meat served here are Halal if that is a concern or not. A must try if you are passing by the area or maybe just need a snack to hit the spot."

1230,PsDUAzWVfI1vEHstvI6LeQ,3/2/2019,1 star rating,Worst place ever. The food took over 2 hours to be delivered after multiple calls to check in. None of the ordered food resembled what we ordered- check out the picture of their idea of grilled cheese sandwich. Chicken wings were just fried chicken with barely any sauce. The whole thing was so bad we ended up just tossing the entire order.

There are a lot of Korean bar foods that aren't as commonly seen at other restaurants around Ktown.My friends and I decided on the spicy stir-fried soondae. There aren't a lot of places that serve soondae, so I was excited it was on the menu. Their soondae is filled more with glass noodles. A perfect mix of sweet, salty, and spicy. There's a good amount of vegetables as well. A perfect drunk food. The rest of the menu also looks amazing, including their wide variety of drinks. The alcohol is also on the cheaper side. There's a discount if you pay in cash, and if you come on a day that's not Friday or Saturday, the receipt gets you a  discount for Space karaoke if you want the night to keep going. Definitely want to be back to try their other offerings."
1246,pcb8yK9_28uWz5CyokjwSg,3/23/2023,5 star rating,"Looking for a hidden gem in the bustling Ktown scene? Look no further than Bangia, a cozy and welcoming Korean bar and restaurant located underground - just like a speakeasy.Despite its name, Bangia is anything but half-baked when it comes to their food and drinks. In fact, their menu is full of delicious Korean dishes that are sure to satisfy any craving, from crispy fried chicken to savory pancakes to hearty stews. And let's not forget about the drinks - with plenty of beer and soju on hand, you're sure to find the perfect libation to pair with your meal.But what really sets Bangia apart from other pochas in the area is the atmosphere. The cozy underground space is perfect for a fun night out with friends or a romantic date. And the attentive servers and clean, inviting atmosphere only add to the experience.Whether you're in the mood for a hearty meal or just a few drinks with friends, Bangia is the perfect spot. So why not venture underground and discover this hidden gem for yourself? With its great vibes and delicious food and drinks, it's sure to become a new favorite in your Ktown repertoire."
1247,pcb8yK9_28uWz5CyokjwSg,2/23/2023,4 star rating,"It's pretty impressive Bangia has remained steadily packed on any given night pretty much since they opened over a decade ago. They appear to be immune from the typical bell curve of a restaurant's busy cycle, and this mostly has to do with their ability to satisfy the drunchies. The typical K-town reveler is downing flavored soju, makgeolli, and vodka sodas, and there are few better things to chase this with than noodles, rice cakes, and fried chicken. Follow all of this with more soju and beer, and you have yourself a good time, which can be had at Bangia (if you're willing to wait).If you show up and there are no tables available, they do have a waitlist system and will text you when a table opens up. They also have heated outdoor seating in a shed if you're willing to sacrifice some ambiance, though there isn't much to speak of that inside either. You're really there for the vats of soup, cheese topped noodles, and fried food, all of which they do well here. I particularly like the army stew on a cold night, or their rice cakes any other time of year.Come summer, unless you go during off peak it's impossible to get a table at Banjia or any of the other popular K-town spots. So if you have your sights set on this place, make a reservation or avoid peak weekend hours."
1248,pcb8yK9_28uWz5CyokjwSg,1/25/2023,4 star rating,"Food is amazing here, be prepared for family style eating. My most recent favorite dish is the Spicy Rice Cakes with Pork, Kimchi, and Mozzarella. The Beef Rice Cake dish was great for something mild/not spicy and I've previously eaten the army stew and bulgogi here as well. A good selection of cocktails and Korean sojus. It may have been our seats but the music was blaring early on in the night (7pm), so much so that it was difficult to hear the people at our own table. The restaurant seemed busy, we weren't ready to immediately order which then drastically delayed the process, with drinks coming out after all of the food and about 30 minutes after we ordered them. Preview the menu ahead of time do you can at least get drinks while figuring out the rest!"
1249,pcb8yK9_28uWz5CyokjwSg,1/2/2023,3 star rating,"This is a bit of a hard review to score because the food is pretty decent. But the price is a bit ourageous. Coming from LA korean food, this is by far subpar. The rice cake was hard and firm. 4/5 for the sauce and toppings The fried chicken did not hit. It was not super crispy. 2/5 for the korean fried chicken. The army stew was my favorite but it was a bit interesting to have pork belly and pepperoini in it!Dam the flavored makgeolli was $35 for a bottle. Wtf....Kind of expensive. If you go in with the expectation that it is wildly overpriced, you'll have a great time."

Service is great and the staff are incredibly friendly and generous with the complimentary dishes.Budae Jjigae - 4/5 One of the more milder army stews that I've had, but the taste is nice and it comes with all the components that you'd expect from a traditional budae jjigae (sausages, noodles, etc.). Spicy Rice Cakes - 4/5 Texture was missing a bit of the signature chewiness that tteokbokki should have and the dish was quite oily, but overall taste was nothing to complain about and was great! Would definitely recommend getting one of the dishes with cheese (like this one), as it paired really nicely with the sauce. Spicy Pork & Squid - 3.5/5 Wasn't too memorable because the sauce was the same or very similar to the spicy rice cakes, but still tasted great. The place gets quite busy on the weekends, so we weren't able to see the vibes inside, but will definitely try to visit again to check it out!"
1251,pcb8yK9_28uWz5CyokjwSg,12/6/2022,4 star rating,"Food (4/5): Came here with a large group for a friend's birthday. The group ordered a variety of dishes from Army Soup, Korean Fried Chicken, fried noodles, seafood pancake, and seaweed soup. The Korean Fried Chicken was quite good and crispy and the Army Soup was well flavored. However, the seafood pancake and some of the other dishes were a bit bland and none of the flavors popped out well.Venue (3/5): For some reason the venue felt a bit cramped and the particular private dining room we were in was cold. This became an issue for the food because they got cold fast. Service (4/5): They didn't check up on us that frequently but the service was helpful and friendly when we asked."

Before entering the restaurant, someone will check for IDs. They serve large portions - highly recommend ordering dishes to share for the table. We ordered the Budae Jeongol (Army Stew), tofu and kimchi with pork, and spicy chicken.The Budae Jeongol was perfect for the chilly night. A bit more tomatoey from the mature kimchi. They also give tables a complimentary steamed egg, great to balance out from the spicier dishes."

So definitely come with couple of friends, b/c that also makes it more fun too!! 5/5 service, food, and ambiance."

1256,w7K-ClWgEuqRQWCyTqlNsQ,3/13/2023,4 star rating,"I was craving a slice of chocolate cake for the longest time and on my way to the post office, I decided to give into temptation. It wasn't that hard considering the sweetest cloud of sugar wafted towards my direction the moment I entered the shop. My plans to get only a cupcake dissolved quickly as I started to drool over their selection of cakes. The staff was really nice and one of them took the time to show me through all their cakes and I ended up getting a slice of their award-winning Brooklyn Blackout ($8.25) and their Coconut Cloud ($8.25). The Brooklyn Blackout was delicious and rich and decadent without being too sweet, which was a feat because my biggest complaint with a lot of traditional American cakes is that they are too sweet for my preference. They use Dutch-process cocoa and the cakes are sandwiched between layers of ganache and covered in a chocolate buttercream. It hit all the spots and managed to stay moist over the course of the three days I spent eating this. Their Coconut Cloud ($8.25) uses their golden vanilla cake base with a coconut filling that was like silky pudding and a light and airy meringue icing. I thought it was a fantastic cake and although it was a little too sweet for my tastes due to the meringue icing, I really liked how soft and fluffy the cake was."
1257,w7K-ClWgEuqRQWCyTqlNsQ,2/26/2023,1 star rating,"I've had other cakes from LCB in the past which were fine, but I had a very poor experience at this particular location. I came in around 10 PM to get a slice with my friend, and got the Tiramisu slice which was advertised as having a cream cheese frosting. You'd think it'd be tangy and fluffy especially to imitate the mascarpone whipped topping tiramisu has, but the frosting was THICK and so so aggressively sweet, I thought it was buttercream. The coffee soak also didn't permeate the layers of the cake well, so it was incredibly dry and crumbly without any frosting. I asked the people working if it was cream cheese, and they said that it was. I said it didn't taste like it (or even remotely balanced or good) and I got the slice solely for that since I don't care for buttercream. They then tasted the cake on their own and said that it indeed was cream cheese frosting and that ""different bakers have different recipes/ratios for the cakes"" so it was sweeter than usual. Wtf? Talk about quality control...I just stood there awkwardly, but no one offered any solution or offered a replacement slice, which I thought was very odd. I would have asked myself but they all seemed very over it & like they didn't care so nothing would have happened anyways. It was especially disappointing considering their slices are like $8-9. That's NOT cheap. I ended up giving a slab of the ""cream cheese"" icing to my friend since her strawberry shortcake slice had virtually no icing and was dry, and I threw the rest of my slice in the trash. I'd recommend Brooklyn Cupcake or Sweets For The Sweeties 10000x over Little Cupcake Bakeshop if you're looking for a cupcake spot in BK to support. Their stuff is SO good and is never dry and customer service is on point. I definitely won't be back, and this has definitely soured my perspective of the Little Cupcake Bakeshop brand overall."

Their cakes and other baked goods are fresh and satisfying. The one drawback is that while they give out huge slices of cake, they're not cheap. If you come here, just expect to pay more than $7 for any dessert. I personally think it's worth it, but if you're looking for a cheap dessert, this is not it. They do have lots of tasty flavors though. I can't imagine anyone NOT finding something they'd enjoy here. Considering the serving sizes are so large and deserts are so rich here I think I could only come by with a group, but it's still a fun place! Oh and it smells wonderful, as expected from a bakery."

I came on a Saturday night with a group of 5 and was able to sit at the large table in the back of the bar, which created a semi-private feel. My friends and I and I were having a chill night out so we ordered Angry Orchards, which were only $6 for a large glass! We got the option of having it with/without ice. My friends and I also ordered a few cocktails during the night, which all equated to ~$7 per cocktail. There are darts in the back area, which you can play for free.The main reason why I love this bar are the staff. The bartenders are so friendly and familial; once you chat with them, it feels like you've known them for years! Our waitress was also very attentive, checking in with us frequently and offering water whenever it seemed like our glasses were empty. And when she gave us a complimentary mini-pizza... like WHAT? How can you not love this woman?! Thanks to her and the staff, we had a wonderful time! Indigo Murphy's is definitely a place to go if you're looking for a place to hangout/chat.

1274,1jWYg-iLBqJSypEJvsxTGw,12/19/2014,3 star rating,"This new bar with neon-blue awnings is built over the wreck of the former Bentley's...and gamely carries on many of the same traditions which put an end to its predecessor.   Indigo Murphy's more truly epitomizes the  ""old man's bar"" than any other you can find in 80 blocks in any direction. Its a bar which lives on 'regulars'. Average age: 55-75. Drinking Bud Lites and Millers, vodka-tonics, and 'old-fashioneds'. It's got that same black, dead, lacquered-beam interior found everywhere in Southern BK. Sports kitsch and Irish knick-knacks all over the walls. Out-of-place: gigantic flatscreens and a stupid hi-tech jukebox; and yeah that garish bright-blue color scheme that comes with the new name. Still the same: the bartenders are ruddy, ole-timey vets (or else younger dudes with too-snug tee-shirts and too many  muscles). You can hear F-bombs and N-words and C-words and gay slurs--talk of weed--all day long, here. Its a sausage fest---you don't come here to find chicks. The only girls who come in here are relatives of the regulars. The place needs more boobs and ass--even a cheerleader calendar would be something. I think there's just ONE Corona poster on the far back wall, with a swimsuit chick. Not enough!Now, don't get me wrong--I really like bars with 'regulars'--but here's the downside: a 'family' bar like this, can have too much ""chumminess"". Too much backslapping and and hallooing and huzza-ing. Too many guys talking about their Toro mowers and their latest oil-job and their timeshares and their sciatica and their hernias and their diabetes. It's just not always what's wanted. Some of us drinkers come out to get away from our families. We wanna sit in peace and quiet and kill ourselves slowly with booze. Enough with the good cheer.Nevertheless, there's some upsides too: pizza place right across the street; and on Sunday/gamedays, there's big buffet trays of free, hot, home-cooked food! Friends,  staff, and family members of Murphy's **bring this in themselves**. Amazing. Try finding that in Manhattan. Bottom line: there are so few bars in highly-residential Dyker Heights; and the 1-2 which are still there are like little atolls---they have a tough time surviving--so we'd better value them while they're still around. Overall, I give 'Murphy's' a positive vote."

Placed an order for curbside pickup using the app.  Ordered a Whopper and Kid's Meal(with onion rings and Diet Coke).  Got there and there is no assigned parking for pickup. Sat in the parking lot after notifying them we were there to get our curbside pickup. Sat there for over 10 minutes.  We then went to the drive thru and the grumpy employee asked what we wanted.  I told them that I ordered from the app and gave them the order number.  They told me that there was no order and asked what my name was. I told them and they said there was no order.  I told them I will come inside and show them the order.  They then said ""oh, we found it.""  Went to the drive thru window. The guy pretty much just threw the bag out the window.  Of course they got the order wrong. Whopper was fine, kid's meal was messed up.  The cheeseburger was fine, they gave apple juice instead of Diet Coke, and fries instead of onion rings.  I told the employee that I need a Diet Coke instead of the apple juice and they had a stink mood and said that I should have put it on the order.  I didn't even get to complain about the fries.  I showed them the order, which had both the onion rings and Diet Soda. They swapped the drink and I just drove off cuz I was really pissed off by then and didn't want to cuss them out. This is not the first time I've had issues.  I keep hoping for the best, but I'm just not going to give Burger King my business any longer.  I guess that's why all the locations are closing!  LOL"

Bought a chicken meal.  A couple of hours later I had to make a b- line for the bathroom. Felt like I was going to vomit but had diarrhea. Day two, all diarrhea. I should've gone with my instincts because when I looked into the franchise from the drive through window, there was trash all over the floor.  The two dudes working the shift seemed sketchy cause they were talking and the guy who took my order kept looking at me for some reason. Needless to say, I would NEVER eat from Burger King again."

We noticed two workers / staff outside with her gloves. Then as we drove off a a lady then walked over to the window. This is disgusting because customer service shouldn't be like this for an establishment that's been there for years. Whomever the owner of this franchise is need to do some serious internal observation because these ppl are playin g with their money / profits.

They are not the typical frozen spring rolls some places serve - they are much larger and looked hand made.For the entrees, we had the Pad See Ew and Khao Soi (a Northern Thai noodle dish in a curry broth). Both entrees were definitely flavorful, but they were also too salty. The place overall is still a solid Thai place. I have to give props to the staff as well, who were extremely friendly and always checking up on us."

Food is authentic Thai and they have synch specials that hit the spot. I tried the fried tilapia with fried tofu as an appetizer and both were very good. The tilapia was both crispy and flaky and the sauce was where the spice came from. The veggies were on the side, so no sauce on them. I would have preferred a little more sauce, but that's just a minor quibble."

The first time I ordered the rolls, it came with tamarind, which I don't mind, but it's too strong and thick as a dipping sauce or to put on rolls, so now I substitute peanut sauce. I also ask for fresh tofu instead of friend. I've ordered for delivery 3x, the first two times were very fast but the last time the guy couldn't find my apartment $ he made me come downstairs, I regret my 25% tip. All other times I had delivery to my place. The side vegetable is so small it's not worth $7 but I feel everything else is a good value."

The papaya salad didn't come out like the original way because they mixed it with mesclun greens. The green curry had too much coconut milk. Overall it was good. The ambiance was cozy and relaxing."

The dream of finding somewhere like Cheers often feels like a true figment of your imagination. So, when spots like Shannon Pot appear on your radar, you're of course a little skeptical. Don't be. From the bartenders to the locals that hang here, this place is wonderful. For a sports bar, their stock of liquor is truly unmatched. Their beer deals are also wild. As in you can get 10 Genesee Cream Ales for $20. Conveniently located by The Gutter, and few breweries you're also in great company. Long Island City has changed rapidly over the years, so spots like Shannon Pot still existing are truly special. Grab a drink here. It will turn into countless rounds."

It's a typical Irish/dive bar in queens, but you pay like you are in flatiron. I got a bottle of miller (which is like 3-5 at most bars in queens/Brooklyn) and they charged me 8. I mean... common.

The parm sandwhich is now $15 not $12.  The bathrooms are now unisex and theres two. The jukebox is in the back. Theres no outlets to charge your phone.  They always get 5 stars in my book because they are a neighborhood bar. The staff is always nice.The food is still good which is great. They changed up their mozzarella sticks to the thicker ones. But the price went up slightly. It just seems like it is more roomy now. There isn't a bar area in the back like the old bar had. The space is a 5 out of 5. I'm glad the same people are working there. Also there is more TVs.  Glad they reopened.The kitchen closes at 11pm on a Thursday.  They have a pbr special 10 for $20. That's not too bad especially when you're on a budget. They are one block away from the E & M and two blocks from the G and 3 to 4  blocks from the 7 train.

I stay in the 'hood doing the airbnb thing from time to time and coming in late last night but with still a bit of energy, thought I'd check this place out. Wow, what an intimate little interior that seems to hark back to another time long ago. Or maybe made to look like that. The bar sure seems like wood and a design easily 50-70 years old. The place is very long and narrow. Nice selection of tap beers, and at first the bartender seemed nice enough. It was quiet, but with a few TVs showing basketball games. Bartender seemed wrapped up in conversation with folks that he clearly knew.So everything seemed great, and for some reason he turns on the most obnoxious FM station playing really loud and bad 80s rock--when the station wasn't blaring five-minute long commercials. Finally, one comes on for -- I'm not making this up -- some kind of prostrate health center. Several of us at one end of the bar start laughing about it and we get the evil glare from sir bartender. He comes down and turns up the volume. Wow.Five stars go to one. Then... gets weirder. Guy walks in, says his mother died and he needs money to get back to Maryland. Bartender goes over, grabs a five out of the register and tells the guy, ""here you go."" Guy walks out. Bartender shrugs and says ""some people are just down on their luck. Easier sometimes,"" (or something like that). OK, guy has a heart I guess. I finish my drink, he can't be flagged without making a scene, and I'm in no hurry so cool my heels. Couple comes in and sits near me so he finally makes an appearance. I give him a $20 for a $17 bill and leave. Funny how a place that could be so great is made into a crapper by someone with a funky, unfriendly attitude. In a city where competition is fierce, seems service would be a premium. Apparently not.If you come: don't be looking for artisanal craft ryes or beet martinis. This is a two-fisted neighborhood joint with tap beers and hard liquor. Good luck if you come. Maybe Mr. Surly will be your bartender."

In the past I have enjoyed their brunches - albeit it may end up being a little pricey. I love their warm croissants that  they start you out with, their cookiebutter pancakes and their nutella cappuccino. I find their dinner menu to be quite small although they have a very large variety and amount of appetizers. This weekend our experience was OK. Firstly there was a lot of commotion as it appears as a few parties before us made incorrect reservations, we had to stand on the staircase for about 10 minutes before being helped and the hostess was rude and looked annoyed. (Yes there was a situation prior but we didnt cause the issue - dont take it out on us). Our server was very nice (white/grey hair) and was very apologetic about the wait. We waited a long time to be able to order drinks and in between we waited for apps, main and desserts. The manager also came and apologized for everything which was appreciated. The creme brûlée is good but the blue melted sugar on top throws me off.  I think they are a better place for breakfast than dinner. This was my first time in a separate room due to a large party but I'm not sure if I'd want to experience that again."

They are freshly made and come out warm.As for the menu items, you will have a tough time selecting. If you come hungry you will leave stuffed! Not one bad dish had here. Even the house-made cocktails are quite delicious.With a cool ambiance like this I can see this being a Valentine's day sellout or if you are trying to impress someone special this will due the trick.

Lobster crostini was refreshing, It was 10/10.Lobster benedict was also quite salty. But sauce was good.Think my favorite is the wild mushroom garganelli, and added shrimp was so tasty.

It seems the place has been renovated since those menu photos were posted. Most up to date is the website! This bandeja paisa platter is probably artery clogging, but so satisfying. You get a huge slab of pork belly, steak, rice, beans, eggs, avocado and plantains. The skin on the pork belly was pretty chewy but the meat was delish (can't go wrong with the belly meat). The rice and beans were fabulous. The steak was a no frill grilled steak, there is a green sauce that comes with the plate and pairs well with the steak. It's almost $30 for this plate. Would I get it again? Probably not. More so for the price and also how unhealthy it is!"

My favorite thing was the cachapa! So for cachapas and arepas, you can choose out of three different types of fillings! We got the mozzerella, plantains, and beans! We added grilled chicken and honestly it was heavenly! It's so large and filling and oozing with flavor! The sweetness of the cachapa compared to the saltiness of the cheese and chicken was a great mix! We also got a vegan chicken arepa. The arepa itself was pretty bland and I wasn't a huge fan of the fried ""chicken"" but my friend really enjoyed this! We also got a bowl with grilled chicken which came with fries, rice, grilled chicken, and beans! The bowl is great if you want something more protein heavy! This was a lot for two people so we had tons of leftovers! Service: everyone who works here is incredibly nice and joyful! They made us feel very welcome and gave suggestions of how we can customize our orders!

The portions are a little smaller for what it's worth. We ordered the bandeja paisa, chicharron arepa, and maduros con queso. They didn't have the croquetas de yuca that day unfortunately, but those looked so good. The bandeja paisa was pretty good; came with a grilled steak (bistec), plantains (platanos), a whole strip of chicharron, rice and beans and an arepa and some maduros. For $22, I feel like I've gotten a little more at other places but this was still delicious! Steak was tender to eat. Chicharron went great with the sauces as well. The maduros were good too. I wish they gave more with the maduros appetizer but it was great with the cotija cheese. Maybe we ordered wrong but I was expecting an arepa sandwich when we got the chicharron arepa. :( Overall, experience here was good.

Because I saw good reviews I decided to order from here last night. I looked at the menu online for options and pricing and then placed my order on the phone, where I was very clearly told $19 for a medium pepperoni. My order arrived about half an hour later and I was charged $21 + tax. I was confused and asked the courier about the price difference and he said he didn't know either. I called back and didnt reach anyone, but today I called again and was told there's a different price online versus on the phone. I asked why and was told it is because third party services charge more, such as doordash -- I would understand if this were not *your* official website, and there is no third party service connected to it so that excuse makes no sense. I would have been willing to shrug this off if the pizza were good, but it genuinely wasn't. There was too much cheese, it was very oily and salty, and the crust was too dense and had no crisp to it. I had to put the pizza back in the oven to brown the cheese and make it taste ""done"". Bad representative of NY pizza. When I tell you I was *shocked* when I opened the box.

We dined in on a Saturday around 5:30pm the staff always checked on us to make sure everything was good and always filled out tea cups when it was empty. The food was good as well the only thing was the salmon teriyaki was a little salty but everything else was good. We ordered the genki special which includes salmon, scallops, shrimp and lobster with white rice and choice of soup or salad. Also ordered some rolls, steak hibachi with white rice. Will definitely order or come back."

It's a good place for sushi, and they have some great lunch specials for those looking for a good deal. Personally, I find their entrees to be quite small and average in taste, but visually pleasing on the plate to tantalize the aesthetic of the food. Overall Genki Sushi is a decent and clean-looking spot for takeout and/or dining in for classic sushi rolls or something extravagant like their Sakura or October Rolls, both of which are fantastic."

I also came here one time for dine in and it was fine. I wasn't highly impressed overall but I was satisfied. We ordered a bunch of rolls -- salmon avocado, eel avocado, spicy crunchy tuna, alaska roll, etc. they were all fresh, but kind of small on size. The pricing is decent. I would order back from here but if you want higher end sushi, this wouldn't be the place to get food from."

As i read the review below me, i can't imagine how or why someone else had hair in their food the same day i did. I started with a salad after a couple of bites i encountered a piece of hair. I put the salad to the side and before i can open my sushi container, i noticed a piece of hair in my sushi as well. Very aggravating knowing i spend so much money at this place and no one in my family even wanted to touch their food they were so disgusted."

We also shared an order of their fried momos, and I also got a mango lassi. Both the momos and the thali sets were amazing, and the workers go around and will refill your rice, veg, and daal if you wish.Generous portions, reasonable prices, tasty food, and attentive service.

Rilthuk- This is one of the traditional food of sherpa. People normally eat during the winter season because it's based on a thick soup . It's a soup dish made with potatoes mashed and mixed with sherpa spices .    If y'all crave for something like these then must give it a try."

Close to the green line. Very convenient! I've only tried the tacos which are pure bang for your buck. They are loaded up and double tortilla'd. Their salsas are fresh and hot. I use the red and green because I want it all. The lady in there is super sweet and funny, and as a Mexican- American that benefits from white privilege its nice to practice my shitty Spanish in peace and without judgement. They have a cute little cooler with great drink options and they take cash and card. It's 2022, I wanna be able to tap baby! Maybe one day I will branch out beyond the tacos as caldo de res season is approaching. Slurp! Slurp! I highly recommend this place. West coast vibes. Very sexy. I will definitely be back!"

The shrimp cocktail it's literally pico de gallo overly cover ketchup sauce & the shrimp you can forget about it. One shrimp cut into 5 pieces. You do the math. So I know times are hard but come on.

As someone who is part Mexican I can appreciate how authentic this place is. From the quality to the generous portions. The cheese quesadilla is always so perfectly melted to perfection, The veggie tacos come in a perfect portion loaded with peppers, onions, tomatoes and cilantro. Not to mention it actually comes with sour cream and lemons.My orders always come before the estimated time, Customer service is always excellent.

The cashier then brought out a small side of mixed rice and beans and said that's what I bought. I explained that she mislead me into paying for half of what I was told I was buying and her only answer was ""Oh...no"". I explained again that it's not cool to mislead a costumer from what they ask for just to give them half as much food as they are told they're ordering, and again I get another ""Oh...no"".Looked online at their menu to see the prices once I got home and rice and beans are only supposed to cost $3.50.There's a reason this restaurant is the worst rated Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood."

Needed to catch up with my cousin, crossed the bridge from Staten and found parking with luck in front. Hospitality was as comforting as the fried zucchini and homemade sangria- hidden on the wine menu. Forgot to take picture of glass was consumed among arrival. Looking forward to going back and staying for dessert at the request of the owner chef who was hustling in the back and front of the house!! Reservations recommended, it was was full house !"

If you want a dining experience similar to a Sunday dinner experience, bring some friends and come through. We got a bunch of apps like the the rice balls (fresh mozz inside pulled the rice and outer fried coating together perfectly), meatballs (made I believe with sirloin beef), and octopus (tender and they give a LOT of octopus). Also got burrata with some fried eggplant strips. Burrata was fresh and fried eggplant strips were a nice addition, didn't taste the eggplant too much though, was a bit more breading - just a minor callout but still was great.I got chicken parm as my main. I know it's basic, but if a place can do the essentials right, that says a lot. The chicken cutlets were nice and thin, basil on top was fresh, mozzarella was fresh, sauce/gravy in all cases was fresh, full-bodied and flavorful. From what I understood the only pasta they make fresh on premises is the cavatelli, but unfortunately were out that night, so I got the rigatoni instead. Even the rigatoni was great - nice and Al dente, nowhere near overcooked. The star of the show to me was the steak piziole (pretty sure I spelled that wrong), which was either sirloin or flank steak and the sauce was amazing - red sauce with cherry peppers gave it nice little kick to it. Steak was tender. I barely got a pic of the chicken parm to attach, everything else was demolished before any pics were taken. Staff were friendly and helpful, and the owner/chef is very passionate about his work. Overall great, home-y experience in terms of tasty, flavorful southern Italian-American food and ambiance that felt like you were somewhere familiar. Large portions for reasonable prices, you'll likely have leftovers. There is a fee for using a credit card which to me, given the popularity and volume of this place isn't necessary, but I didn't ding a star given the rest of the experience. There's a bar up front also, and cool decor."

It's a Kale Salad!Puttanesca Sauce was my Mothers go to spaghetti sauce every Christmas Eve.  The KEY ingredient is ANCHOVIES which separates it from all other red sauces.  There were no anchovies in this recipe.  It's not Puttanesca without anchovies!If this restaurant is based on ""roots"" the chef needs to do some homework.Yes, the portions are big but that is not what is supposed to be the story here.

I have to warn that it is extremely cold at the bar so make sure to keep your jacket on or order their hot alcoholic beverages.  Unfortunately, they had ran out of hot apple cider and boozy hot chocolate so I ended up ordering their most sour draft beer. I don't usually drink beer but this drink sounded interesting with a mix of oranges and mangos. I loved it! I was also hungry and wanted a quick snack while waiting for the show to start so I asked the bartender about the nachos with jalapeños. He recommended it but I wasn't so sure about the jalapeños since I didn't want to burn off my tongue. He said that he could give me the nachos without it but highly recommended it. He then added that he didn't want to pressure me in choosing something I didn't want. So he was very helpful and thoughtful. I ended up going for the full nacho experience and loved it. The art on the wall in this place is meant to be hard rock with its skulls and coffin drawings garnishing the place. I loved it! The bathroom has tons of porn picture, which made me feel like a teenager again sneaking into a bar that I'm prohibited from going to.

Walking up there's normally a small crowd off the sidewalk enjoy the good weather and a few people floating in and out the door. I was more lost with all the artwork. Outdoor drinking and artwork is my thing. Some cute dogs being posed for (most likely) an instagram pic finally got me to check out the image on the cups. Pine Box. I needed a drink when the name/picture finally hit me. Had to test out the bartenders. Bartenders were friendly and seem willing to make some cocktails after asking a few questions on our taste. Indoor and outdoor seating so I had plenty of options to where I wanted to take my drink. Top of a dark & stormy with a lemony sangria and a black cherry sangria and I was ready to laugh away for the live comedy. Oh and the many vegan options around had us eating both sweet and savory around our drinks. This place is a win.

Covid-19 has wreaked havoc on the food and bar industry, when we heard they offered delivery we jumped on it! We were outside of the delivery area yet they took our order anyway and delivered to us super quickly!

The food isn't too salty which was a plus for my mom and I. My brother enjoyed his hainanese chicken. You can get either white or yellow rice. Decent portion for $9 I guess...My mom got 2-3 meals from it since she can't eat too much. The young chow fried rice wasn't salty, but it doesn't have that wok hei so it was very plain tasting. I didn't mind it. Beef chow fun had more flavor, again if there was some wok hei, would've been tastier. Not much beef but that's to be expected. Still lots of noodles.

The food isn't too salty which was a plus for my mom and I. My brother enjoyed his hainanese chicken. You can get either white or yellow rice. Decent portion for $9 I guess...My mom got 2-3 meals from it since she can't eat too much. The young chow fried rice wasn't salty, but it doesn't have that wok hei so it was very plain tasting. I didn't mind it. Beef chow fun had more flavor, again if there was some wok hei, would've been tastier. Not much beef but that's to be expected. Still lots of noodles.

Good spot to plug in and get some work done if you can score one of these spots. While I was here a few days ago they kept coming around with trays of sample drinks off the Fall menu. That was pretty nice and I was able to try so many. Winning! Friendly staff here too.
1446,0oz5fC_Z57VJSdlEz8xlGA,10/20/2021,4 star rating,Starbucks 1st Avenue and East 75th Street is a spacious location. Customers that are vaccinated spread out their computers and sit inside. There's no outside seating and the scaffolding detracts from the otherwise nice location. One day I stopped in for a coffee. It's a nice walk from my apartment. It's easy to social distance inside if you go at the right time of day. I'm not sure why the reviews are so low. It's a Starbucks for crying out loud!
1447,0oz5fC_Z57VJSdlEz8xlGA,9/8/2022,3 star rating,Starbucks is a NYC staple and this one was well run from my experience. It was a bigger starbucks with a nice bathroom. Drinks came out quickly.  Solid spot.

1449,0oz5fC_Z57VJSdlEz8xlGA,1/28/2022,1 star rating,Terrible customer service and they are always backed up with orders even though they seem well staffed. They spend more time ignoring and neglecting customers while they socialize instead of making drinks.

Then I'm waiting while those drinks get made. There must be a better way to manage this. There was ONE person ahead of me in line -- in a normal world, this is an indication that I won't be in there too long. But no, AFTER placing my ONE DRINK order, I had to WAIT 13 MINUTES! Grr"

I appreciate knowing that I'm able to use a bathroom in the city without making a purchase (let's be honest, if I'm in Starbucks.. I'm making a purchase). But isn't there a line that you could draw? This place is a circus in here. As offensive as that might sound.. it really is. I would never come here with my laptop, I would be too afraid that it would be stollen. As I sit here with my coffee... I'm extremely distracted by all the people screaming and talking loudly to themselves. Between Taylor Swift blaring in the background and the ever so often occasional scream.. I'm really uncomfortable.   This place is trashed. It's so gross.  They have a large cafe area for you to sit and work. The only issue is... it's filthy. I cringe just thinking about it. Such a large seating area, covered in grime. I keep hand sanitizer in my pocket as soon as I walk in here. The staff refuses to call out the drink and name of the customer. They are far too busy chatting with each other to take the time to notice anyone else."

I'm going to make it a point to just avoid this location all together.  Today, I found out that another location that I go to, closed down so I came here for a mobile order. First thing is as soon as I walked in, the entire store smelled like Easy Off fumes. There were 2 staff members working there and they just completely ignored everyone. The mobile order drinks were facing into the counter and covered by plexi glass so you don't even know if your order is ready especially because the baristas kept placing drinks there without calling out names. At one point, I saw a customer lean over and just reach around to grab a drink. I was in the store for maybe 8 minutes before I got one persons attention and found out my drink was just sitting there the whole time."

It's beautiful industrial-ish style setup sets it apart from the rest. I had the four cheese personal pizza and a margarita pizza with chicken and pineapples. DE-LIC-IOUS !

That dish alone I'll tell you to come and cop. The meatballs were okay, decent portion and If I remember correctly came with 3 balls? The server was also acting as the bartender. She was prompt, to the point and made sure to check-in from time to time.When me and my guest went it was busy.  Beautiful artwork on the walls.

1458,JAWWRCjAjAIKOflewu2gFA,8/9/2021,4 star rating,"Being that hubs had a craving for some 'cue nearby and nothing I enjoyed eating there, I thought coming to Monte's on Alexander Ave & 134th St in the Mott Haven section of The Bronx was the next best thing- that I haven't tried in the area. Plus the menu reads well.Monte's interior is industrial/chic-ish with light wood tables, soft lighting with cement-like flooring. A relaxed neighborhood joint it is. Walls pay respects to local artists with some Bronx musician portraits of past and present. Placing my take-out order was seamless with the friendly ladies even with one of them telling me this same location has gone through three ownerships(?). And based on past business photos, pizza looked like the real deal back then compared to now. I believe pizza is at its best when the sauce is kept simple. The mushrooms in my Mushroom Pizza were fresh and not canned- but scarce. Had a seasony sauce that was not only heavy in taste but pulled down the slice midway. Even with the 10 minute drive from here to my Mom's house, the cheese didn't have a good melt factor. So for me getting that ooey-gooey texture, is ALSO a plus. I will say though, the pie has a soft and thin Neapolitan-style base with crispy outer edges and charring marks. No-pork Roasted Brussels sprouts were nice. Baked Mozzarella wedges were interesting and wanted more of a melt. The Nutella in my shake needed a stronger dose to make it pop. Food wasn't horrible. I'm just not sure if Monte's is carrying the pizza torch- but I may want to revisit for their pastas."

This place was so good that we came twice in the short amount of days we were In New York. A few items of note that I highly recommend are the spaghetti and meatballs or the lasagna. As afar as appetizers go, get yourself some garlic twist. I found myself eating almost all of them after dipping it in the sauce. Lastly, I wanted to mention the pizza here is top notch, I had four slices of an entire pizza when I was supposed to share. The atmosphere here is super festive. They had music playing the first night we came in. Our second visit, they had game night with board games and beer pong going on. This spot is so well known some sanitary guys parked their truck outside to order some pizza. Service was great and friendly. I highly recommend this spot, overall amazing experience."

1461,JAWWRCjAjAIKOflewu2gFA,3/13/2022,5 star rating,I had forgotten what great food had tasted like before stepping foot in this place. The pizza alone makes me contemplate moving to NYC. We had a group of 3 and were able to split 2 pizzas and a salad. It was very delicious. The food was super satisfying and fulfilling without the feeling of over indulgent. We ordered a focaccia bread appetizer and the ricotta and honey mix along with the bread was an sensational combo. The service was phenomenal and super friendly and attentive. This place is a hidden gem and a must-visit.
1462,JAWWRCjAjAIKOflewu2gFA,10/3/2021,5 star rating,Quick pit stop for a lunch before heading to the lit bar across the street. Didn't expect it to slap like THAT. I love when a place has wings that are baked like not only is it good but like guilt free?  perfectly crispy and well cooked wings. We got the Maple Chipotle and it was the perfect blend of sweet with a little kick. The potato wedges is what got me. I sat here trying to figure out WHAT about them was driving me insane. Like they were incredible (TO ME). They were like a creamy seasoned milky baked potato that was cut into wedges. I'm not sure if that registers for anyone but wow. 10/10. Will come back next time to try a pie. They only sell pizza by the pie.

The place is small and very cozy. It wasn't super busy when we first got there but it definitely got really busy! And it was not loud at all.We were seated promptly. My friend had coffee and I had a latte which came out with a heart shaped design. For brunch my friend had the breakfast sandwich and I had the bergamot pancakes. LET ME TELL YOU! I'm not a big pancake eater but these pancakes were light, fluffy, oh so full of flavor. The blueberries on top were just perfect! I didn't even need the syrup on the side. Lots of items on the brunch menu. I can't wait to come back to try the dinner menu! And the prices are good too."

This is a very small bit high in quality and rightness restaurant. The space has been a reference in design for almost a decade now. The furniture is both functional, greatly dimensioned as non-monumental, and cute. The menu is so clever, informed, contemporary, tasty, cosmopolitan and, yes, healthy. This is just what we need now. Always a bit acid, to respond to the tastefulness. Always something cooked, with something raw. Eating here expands your culinary spectrum. Service could not be nicer. If you come here, you'll become better and more satisfied!"
1468,8UwRTdW4OtSEI2rJ_p1zGg,3/30/2023,4 star rating,"The restaurant in question presents a paradox. On one hand, the food is impeccably clean, beautifully presented, and undoubtedly delicious. The design is strikingly unique, a timeless aesthetic that evokes a sense of place - perhaps Finland, or someplace similarly distant. And yet, despite these undeniable merits, the restaurant's reputation remains tainted.The problem lies not with the restaurant itself, but rather with the terminology used to describe its location. The term ""Dimes Square"" - applied to a small cluster of businesses scattered throughout Chinatown - leaves a sour taste in one's mouth. It feels disingenuous, a cynical ploy to attract customers in search of the latest hipster hotspot.But the issue runs deeper than mere marketing tactics. The term ""Dimes Square"" carries with it an association with a broader social and political movement, one that promotes a reactionary and exclusionary worldview. The very notion of elitist service in lower Manhattan feels like an extension of this movement, a manifestation of the pro-racism, homophobia, and transphobia that characterizes it.And yet, in spite of these concerns, the people who work at the restaurant are unfailingly pleasant and genuine. They are simply doing their job, providing an exceptional dining experience to their customers. It is not their fault that the term ""Dimes Square"" has been co-opted by unsavory elements, nor are they in a position to distance themselves from it.In the end, the decision of whether or not to patronize the restaurant is a deeply personal one, rooted in individual values and beliefs. But regardless of one's choice, it is crucial to acknowledge the complexity of the situation and to approach it with nuance and sensitivity."

There were lots of ""trendy"" people there when we went on a Sunday morning.

I ordered from them on DoorDash bc they have like 4.8 stars there. I went in person once and got some kind of brunch tacos and side of potatoes. I love their potatoes. They also have a nice assortment of beverages for those of us who don't drink coffee. Lovely unique spot, very popular despite the nitpicking reviews on here"
1474,8UwRTdW4OtSEI2rJ_p1zGg,1/28/2023,1 star rating,"The quality of the food at this place was underwhelming. My partner and I were surprised that this restaurant didn't carry sugar or any sweeteners for coffees. Upon asking we were given attitude and were offered honey instead. The same goes with salt for savory foods.The service left much to be desired, as the staff seemed to be bothered by our simple requests. Also, upon paying the server (who also dabbled as the bartender) threw my partner's card on the table and left. Needless to say we left disappointed and a little violated to be quite honest."

1477,NjNTbqiiSmGknApAoo09Mg,1/11/2022,3 star rating,"I've never been here in person, but i order delivery from here all the time! It's not bad and not exceedingly good either, but I only usually order california rolls so it's hard to make those badly. It's exactly what you'd expect when you order sushi. They have lunch specials that come with soup OR salad so i usually order those. I've tried rolls with salmon and tuna inside but they didn't taste very fresh (pretty fishy) so I just stick with non-raw fish options. I ordered the kani salad too and they plate the dish with lettuce. The lettuce tasted really weird although i'm not sure if you're even supposed to be eating that. Regardless, i'm not a fan of strange tasting lettuce in my food. I do think they make solid california rolls though! you can tell they sometimes skimp on rice but it's okay - what matters is what's on the inside! I wouldn't recommend this as a dine in spot but if you're just trying to order some sushi rolls without raw fish for dinner at a cheap(er than other places in the area) option, this place won't disappoint you."
1478,NjNTbqiiSmGknApAoo09Mg,9/8/2021,3 star rating,"Good lunch spot for Japanese food.I got the pork katsu bento box. It came with the katsu, 6 piece California roll, a side salad, and rice. The portions were hefty for the price I paid, $10. The katsu was solid, but the sushi fell a bit short. But for the price point, I'll look the other way. This is a middle of the pack restaurant."
1479,NjNTbqiiSmGknApAoo09Mg,3/8/2021,3 star rating,"COVID/pandemic era review:Solid but underwhelming sushi. Got the maki roll special F with spicy tuna, spicy salmon, shrimp tempura. Solid, nothing special but gets the job done. The mushed up spicy sushi was alright. The prices are much cheaper to competitors though. Solid sushi, good prices."
1480,NjNTbqiiSmGknApAoo09Mg,4/1/2021,5 star rating,"**Delivery/Take-out**We recently tried Ikura for some Japanese takeout when COVID claimed one of our frequently patronized sushi spots. We were pleasantly surprised by the wide variety available on the menu and the quality of ingredients. We have a young one who hasn't developed a taste for sushi yet but she loves their shrimp tempura appetizer as well as their yaki soba noodles with chicken. I have tried their salmon bento lunch box, sushi deluxe and Chirashi - all were quite delicious. My favorite, however, is the salmon lovers which comes with 5 salmon sushi and 1 salmon roll. We ordered lunch today and my husband ordered kimchi - which I didn't expect to be on the menu for a Japanese restaurant and it was wonderful - it will be on our order list again!"

1482,NjNTbqiiSmGknApAoo09Mg,6/11/2020,4 star rating,"Ordered a chirashi bowl and a bubble tea for lunch for pickup. It was ready in about 10 minutes. During this time they have a table outside and will bring your order outside of the store. The chirashi was good and consistent with what you would expect from a neighborhood spot. The bubble tea was better than I expected, it wasn't overly sweet and the bubbles were cheery. I ordered the passion fruit one. If you're looking for a neighborhood sushi spot, I would recommend!"
1483,NjNTbqiiSmGknApAoo09Mg,8/7/2021,5 star rating,"I'm a huge fan of sushi. Ikura Sushi certainly delivers every single time with my food. I frequent a bar across the street, so Ikura is always my go to for when I need some sustenance. I absolutely love their shrimp tempura rolls. Always fresh and crisp. Definitely a favorite.Their rolls are always made so neat. Almost damn near art! I really appreciate how much love and care they put in the food preparation. They also make you feel extra special when you walk in which is super nice. It puts a smile on my face. My favorite sushi spot in Williamsburg!"
1484,NjNTbqiiSmGknApAoo09Mg,3/6/2022,2 star rating,The food was good and I order from here all the time but this time really made me not want to order from here. I got the fried ice cream and there was a piece of plastic in it. I had comment about this on grub hub but the fact that there is more plastic is crazy! I unfortunately won't be ordering from here anymore. Such a bummer though.

I liked the mapo tofu and while it definitely got me with the spice it also kinda made me think....is this the right spice?

So, we ordered the shrimp cocktail and crabcake appetizers, and then shared the lamb entrée. it turned out to be the perfect amount of food for us. We had just enough room for a little bit of dessert. The restaurant is a classic, solid, neighborhood spot. The staff is very friendly yet professional.

Brian, the waiter was fabulous and gave us the red carpet treatment. The food was great!  I had the hamburger and corn chowder soup. That really hit the spot. The remainder of my party had ravioli, Berkshire Farms pork chop and grilled Atlantic Salmon. They all tasted good as well. The lighting was not bright or dim. Just right! Brian came by and said hi to me by name,  said Happy New Year and shook my hand.  The dessert was great as well.  Brian has been a constant fixture at Chadwick's for many years since we first met him. Great person with a positive attitude. I hope his boss (I think his name his Jerry) acknowledges this. Jerry was off tonight. I spoke to the bartender and to give Jerry my message. Thanks Brian for your outstanding service for all these years. Jerry, you have an outstanding waiter second to none!!"

I tried to eat it and couldn't even chew it. It was also dry, there wasn't even any juice from the meat in the plate. My friend was able to eat it because she prefers rarer meat, I wasn't. I mentioned to the waiter and he said ""that can't be helped. When a steak has a bone, it usually comes out on the rare side"". ???He offered to cook it more but by then I was so turned off by the tasteless dry steak, that I said not to bother. My friend took the leftovers home and said she would throw it in the grill. Afterwards we ordered Zambuca for each of us and one espresso. They never even comped the drinks!  I will never go there again."

Salsa Verde?  They paired ITALIAN Calamari with MEXICAN Tomatillo sauce??  Never has there been a more perfectly paired sauce with butter-tender fried Calamari... We didn't even TOUCH the arribiata.  The steaks came out and they smelled like fresh summer barbeque.  So yummy...  The man and I asked for Medium-Rare, and that's exactly what we got; bright red (not purple, not gray) meat, perfectly seasoned and seared.  The sides were very delicious but the man and I were so entranced with the steak, we barely ate our sides; we kept consuming the steak.  We skipped dessert because we were THAT full.  Five-star, EEEEAAAASSSSSY...."

They had security and carded us, although we were the only people there! I did not drink any alcohol but they did. No one seemed displeased, nor did they seem blown out of the water from the drinks they ordered. I did want to go get a drink eventually but I didn't. Not sure why. Otherwise, a nice place to chill while we waited for our next adventure."
1536,qY10Mu0ZMicHPbj-nVaTNQ,10/4/2022,3 star rating,"It's pretty deep into LES so quite annoying to reach when it's freezing outside. There was a line outside late Friday night that didn't take too long to get through. We waited maybe around 20-30 minutes to get in. We didn't have any issues with bouncers as the other reviews suggested. Inside, they do make you check in your coat. It's about $3 but they also take Venmo (not sure if it's a different price for that). Drinks are a little inconsistent - got one vodka cran with mostly cran, little vodka and then another one that was almost all vodka, little cran. The place itself is pretty crowded inside. The music is slightly hit or miss - mostly pop but I only recognized maybe about 50% of it. But it was fun and has a cute vibe being a ""grocery store""."

My friends and I came here on a Saturday night because we had been here before and knew it was a fun spot. This experience, however, was just the opposite. The bouncers manning the door to get into the dance floor area were screaming at us to coat check our jackets (and pay for it) when they were part of our outfits!! It's 50 degrees outside and we are being screamed at to take our leather jackets off, fully exposing ourselves. Not only were the bouncers rude, but the bartenders were yelling at us to leave too since we were outwardly complaining in front of them. No woman should EVER be forced to take off part of her outfit and pay for it to be stowed. The bouncers were also cursing at my friends which is absolutely no way to treat paying customers. If I wanted to take off my jacket I would. Never coming back here."
1538,qY10Mu0ZMicHPbj-nVaTNQ,2/28/2023,1 star rating,The security here is highly unprofessional. They are absolutely horrible at de-escalating situations. I watched them jump someone in front of the place 5 to 1 and then they choked out a girl on the hood of a running vehicle. It was a 6'5 male choking out a girl a whole foot shorter than him while everyone was screaming at him to stop. He choked the girl so hard she had a bruise on her neck. Absolutely pathetic excuse for a man he should be held accountable for his actions.

When confronted by members of the community instead of being accountable Arlene's turned off their comments on their Instagram post.

Made one wrong turn, never received a stamp, and was berated when I couldn't hear properly,  then assaulted by the bouncer - could have easily grabbed my arm or bag but instead scalped me. A joke.

I didn't even order a drink; all I got was this muffin. But let me tell you. This was the worst muffin I've had in my entire life, and I spent most of my childhood eating my mom's sugar-free muffins. As soon as I bit into this thing, I wanted to spit it out. It was so dry, like eating heaping mouthfuls of sand. You'd think that as I got further into the muffin it'd get better because at least the chocolate would make it slightly more moist, right? WRONG. It somehow just continued to be sand, but just with chocolate. Chocolate sand. The outside was stale-- I wouldn't be surprised if I were eating a two day old muffin-- and as I've already made abundantly clear, the inside was not much better. Definitely don't get the muffin.

Now still busy as they have online platforms and online ordering. I ordered online as I walked and placed my order. The Cashier was very nice and helped me find my order and retrieve my free guacamole and queso. The gentleman was busy but helped me by making my order to meet its pick up time. My order was delayed but honestly I think a DoorDash courier took it by mistake or for consumption from the shelf. So I did not mind the wait as the team helped me get my order as paid for.Space is the same, big and tables for groups and individual counters. Clean space and music was chill not loud or obnoxious as before. I do wish Chipotle had the option to press the burritos so they stay warmer for to go.

I can honestly say I never had food from this location and disliked it or were disappointed with it. Also the food constantly gets refilled since it's a busy location and the food doesn't lay there for hours like other places.

And the second 1/4 spoon made it a full portion. I'm on to all the tricks of chipotle. That brisket was pretty good. Definitely should be on the menu permanently.

This past weekend I noticed I did not have my credit card in my wallet. I searched high and low in our apartment and at the playground where I take my son. Nothing. I saw that the last charge was from when I got Chipotle for lunch a few days earlier. I called the store and explained that I might have lost my credit card at their store. The manager took my name and confirmed that they had my credit card. This was at least 4 days after I had last used it at Chipotle and they still had it. The manager was so nice and helpful. But I also want to give a shout-out to the professional and honest staff who saw a credit card left in the card machine and turned it in for safe keeping to the manager. There were NO fraudulent charges. This never happens in New York. I tried to leave a tip but the manager refused and said ""we just hire great people"" and he's right. We will continue to frequent this Chipotle as long as we live in JH and I will encourage everyone to do so. Honest people are hard to come by, but they are at this location.

Sometimes the boba has been inconsistent and overcooked but for the most part it's pretty solid. I typically get just a regular tea with little or no sugar and boba. The fruit teas are really sweet if that's your thing too.

The cashier was polite and professional, entering my order quickly and efficiently.  I ordered a large, but when I went to pick it up it was a medium, the barista behind the counter poured it into a cup, added more milk and boba, no additional tea. I was a little peeved because it did not have the signature flavor of the dirty Brown sugar milk tea. Way too milky and sweet."

I paid $54.00 for two oxtail meals and a beef patty. Only one oxtail was delivered. When I called the restaurant the male staff member was very hostile and aggressive about it not being his fault and that the Uber delivery guy stole my order. He told me to call Uber Eats and hung up the phone. I will never order from here again. Disgusting service.

The goat head soup was DISGUSTING! There was hair still on the meat, there was okra in the soup, you don't put okra in goat head soup! Big chunks of carrot and they left the skin on all the plantains. The flavor was awful. This was the worst Jamaican food I've ever had. Just plain sloppy and nasty! There can't be Jamaicans cooking in this place. Don't order from here it's not cleanly and they have horrible attitudes. Never again"
1588,zuaO8_t7NWCWP7ewuuuTBg,1/30/2022,4 star rating,"Customer service was good. This place is a hit or miss. If you want your food fresh then you must get there before lunch rush. Also lunch menu is cheaper than regular menu for same portions. I wasn't too impressed with the texture of the oxtail - but was seasoned well. Patties are a hit or miss as well. They gave me an old patty that looked and tasted like it's been sitting for days.... Ugh. If the food is fresh it's usually good. The fried fish with spicy onions and peppers is my favorite dish here.  Price is a bit steep for a plate that is 80% rice. So I decided to visit a few authentic Caribbean restaurants in ""the hood"" of Brooklyn and the prices are almost identical. If you want the perfect meal then I suggest booking a flight to Jamaica!"

I ordered a large Braised Oxtail Dinner with a Beef Patty. Both were good and I ended up eating it all in one sitting. I thought the oxtail dish was heavy on the rice and not enough veggies. The meat was marinated and juicy, but there was not a lot of it for the price I paid ($19). The beef patty was savory and a good appetizer. Lastly, delivery was faster than anticipated. Overall, a good takeout place to get a quick taste of Jamaican food."

The tall man man with the hat Jamaican hat had a terrible attitude.  After I received my food I paid the man and he proceeded to take the next customers order without giving me a receipt or change.  I'm thinking, I know I get change back so I asked him for my receipt.  He gives it to me and heads to the back to microwave the other patron's jerk chicken order.  When he comes back to the front he begins pacing.  Not even acknowledging me until I ask him for my change.  His response, ""You want $0.15. Here"" and proceeds to take change out of his pocket and hand it to me as though I had the audacity to ask him for it. Coins in my hand and coins rolling to the floor. I look back at the coin that rolled onto the floor and happen to look at the other patron waiting for his food and he's just shaking his head at the whole situation.One could argue it was only $.15c, which is what I was thinking before I decided to ask for my change, but I was raised that if you go to the store for someone with someone else's money, you give them back all of the change from THEIR money and let that person give you, if any, what they want to.  You keep it and it's stealing no matter how large or small a sum.  It was my money and to be offended because or have an attitude because I asked for MY money is downright unacceptable.  He ended up giving me $0.60 back with the dime rolling onto the floor.  I left it there and and put the rest in the tip jar.  I should have listened to my gut and had a cold lunch from the grocery store on the next block.The microwave and Golden crust patty's were enough to keep me away, but I won't even recommend them to the person I dislike the most.  Check your receipts and count your change when you go to this place."

Admittedly it's a little disappointing when there are no plaintains left in the evenings, but other than that we have good meals from here. I'm surprised by all the complaints here, given that this is just a tiny takeout counter. I guess it all depends on your expectations - for me it's a great find because it's a good casual place and so unassuming, but if you're expecting it to be a place you can depend on for corporate style catering, well, I can imagine how it might not fit the typical mold. I always pick up my order in person and have never had any issues. Also this place seems to have a pretty loyal following, but maybe the customers are not all Yelpers so they are not represented here."

They sandwich was great good flavor and great cuts of me nothing fatty (I hate biting into meat fat). The fries were perfectly fried and seasoned. The Parmesan was a nice touch. The focaccia bread for the sad which was fresh and had great sauce to top it offService: servers were attentive from moment we stepped in. Our water glasses were never empty. They checked in but weren't too annoying and did not awkwardly hover. They were friendly and cleared our table at the right time. All the food came out together.Ambiance: it's a small narrow place with an open kitchen. They played Spanish music in the background (a bit loudly). But it's a lively ambiance and environment with lots of chatter. The decor is clean and modern.Price: food for brunch was a tad bit over priced but they did have great quality ingredients so justifiableOverall I will come back to try regular weekday menu

Oysters were 3$ each and fresh tasting. Must is the burrata and radish..I could have taken the plate home! So fresh and the pesto was soo good. The short rib ravioli was delicious as well. It wasn't the short rib but the sauce that made the dish. Ceviche was very flavorful and I enjoyed the pieces of octopus in there!I would skip the mac and cheese and oxtail croquettes in favor of trying the seafood pasta that everyone raves about. Unfortunately we didn't have enough room! Will come back. It was very busy inside on a Friday evening and opted to sit outside instead for a more quiet date night.

For our entrees we order the lobster rolls and duck Two ways. To finish the night we shared some tiramisu and budín. All night we had coconut mojitos and old fashions. Every dish was packed with amazing flavors and seasoning. The crispy skin on the duck was perfectly rendered which the lobster rolls packed giant pieces of lobster in every bite.

Unfortunately, my recent meal here tells me that it is what it is.Oxtail Croquettes - nothing that special at allMussels Billy B - saffron sauce was not bad, but mussels were not plump, mostly puny, also fell out of the shells, which is a sign of being overcookedCalamari - once again, edible, but just averageSteak Panini - one of the better items, but the bread was not pressed at allWhite Radish Burger - maybe one of the better itemsMixed Seafood Pasta - same saffron sauce as mussels app, cooked al dente, seafood cooked alrightGrilled Salmon - meh, really felt quite boringLobster Roll - two mini rows with terrible bread not suitable for this sandwich, lobster was just okMy philosophy is simple.

They have a specific brunch menu where every dish is $24 and comes with coffee/tea/soda, which at first struck me as kind of steep for the area. I wish they offered their regular menu too, since there were some good raw bar options, but understand completely a smaller kitchen's need for a designated brunch menu. I went with the farmer's omelette, given my hankering for a bunch of different things on a plate. First, the picture doesn't do the size of the omelette justice, it was the length of two fists put together. I suppose you do get your money's worth if you get this dish. Came with some standard mixed greens, toast, and home fries. Of the sides, the potatoes stood out. Toast was sadly stale and tasteless. Omelette was nice and fluffy, a little on the well-done end, but perfect with some hot sauce and ketchup. On the whole, the food was delicious but left my mouth feeling like an oil slick. Our waiter was friendly and came by often to see if we needed anything. I recommend making reservations on the weekends - a line started forming as we were finishing up, though there were still plenty of tables inside."

I started off with the raw oysters that were poorly shucked , one shell was so jagged I thought I had gotten a cut in my mouth . My main dish was the lobster roll and chips , which I think is over priced and tiny . In the lobster roll there was barely any lobster and each roll I would say it's two to three bites . And the chips were burnt , idk how they even put that on a plate and served it . My first time there was way better . I do recommend the oxtail croquettes."

It was pretty empty except for two other tables of two people.Right off I will say I liked the decor. It was simple but yet modern. The staff were all really friendly especially our waiter. We order a hamburger and steak and eggs off of the brunch menu. My steak and eggs were good. The meat was tender and my eggs were soft. I felt like the meat used for the steak was in the burger as well but I'm not sure. It was a decent choice. Now the tres leches is something to write home about. It came with raspberry syrup on the plate along with a cream. It wasn't too sweet or overly wet which I don't like at all. It wasn't on their menu but the waiter suggested that we try it. Overall I would come back to try dinner. The brunch menu is limited compared to their normal menu and there were things I definitely want to try like the calamari and pork belly.

We eventually settled on a dozen oysters, beef sliders, the white radish burger, panini, duck two ways, brussel sprouts, and the white radish mac and cheese. All of the dishes were well portioned, flavored well, and ultimately satisfying. Ultimately worth visiting if you're in the area."

I got the California crepe and instantly regretted it when the most pronounced flavor was from the plain yogurt they smothered. The crepe itself was rubbery and the rest of the toppings were super lacking. It felt like I was just chewing the textures. Normally I don't need to eat foods with sauces but everything was unseasoned so this is one of the few times I would have wanted some kind of sauce.Also, in the midst of the delta variant going around, everyone working was maskless and the visitors coming in and out to talk to the workers were maskless as well.

I'm definitely going back to try those in my next visit.

The mentaiko carbonara was made from thinner maybe ramen noodles, not the usual pasta noodle. But the flavor was super rich and creamy. This place was one of the better tasting Izakaya places I've been to. Service was also really good with the waiter checking in on us and refilling our water regularly. I got the yuzu ginger ale but it wasn't the best alcoholic drink IMO so I would try another cocktail next time. Tip: Make sure to book a reservation in advance.

Shishito peppers were small and seemed more microwaved than blistered fresh. The seaweed salad was also fine, not special. Gyoza/dumplings were not grilled and seemed steamed (not crunchy at all).So, not great. One of the chicken items (karashee?) was great; others were average at best.

After a few months, went again this evening and was reminded why I love this Izakaya Juraku so much - so many delicious (and quality) options both from a drink (mainly beer and sake) and good standpoint. Some of our favorites are the loaded chicken karage fries (yes it's as heavy and delicious as it sounds - elevated cheese fries), the scallop skewer, and the pork belly skewer. We tried the takowasa and pork buns this time around and both where super tasty. While we didn't get drinks this time, previously my favorite has been the matcha IPA (forgetting name off hand). Such an interesting meld of complex flavors. Also - service is always pretty good and attentive.

The decor is awesome, and they play classic anime like City Hunter on their TVs, and project episodes of One Piece onto the wall. Heads up, this place usually requires reservations, but you can get a seat at the bar if you don't have one.Food: I've noticed that food at izakayas tend to be lower quality than if you were to go to a full-blown restaurant, for example. But honestly, you don't go to izakayas for the food. You go for cheap, good eats, a nice vibe and drinks. And this place delivered on those fronts. I ordered the Brown Butter Miso Ramen, and as a ramen lover I'd give this a 7.7 out of 10. It really tasted like buttered popcorn mixed with ramen, but hey, I'd still eat it. We also got Takoyaki and Karaage Loaded Fries. One thing I should say about this place is that their beer selection is HUGE. If you're a fan of imported beer or sake this place is like heaven.Service: Service was amazing. So we didn't have a reservation, but they let us sit at the bar. And the bartender was super nice. He gave us good recommendations on food and drink and then he even gave us a Matcha Bomb on the house! While I can't guarantee they will give complimentary drinks out for anyone who visits, just know you can expect good service if you sit at the bar! The owner also helped us identify the anime playing on the TVs. He's quiet, but a nice man for sure."

We enjoyed both the lacto stout and the anbai (salty plum) beers. The skewers were on point -- the savory and juicy pork belly, scallops, and chicken thighs all hit the spot. The ""good"" edamame (garlic and buttery) was indeed good. Don't bother with the plain! The manager/owner was fun and did a great job describing the various beers. Not everyone might appreciate the pretend-attitude but it made us laugh. Good times!"

I'd recommend going as a group to try as much as possible. The wine selection was extensive, affordable, and exceptional quality specializing in Iberian wines. I had the cava which was great. We ordered a bunch of snacks and starters including the anchovies (boquerones) and kroketas both of which were delicious. The highlight of the evening was the special: a suckling pig that melted off the bone! I will def go back. Can also recommend the squid ribbons.The service was great. They seated us even without a reservation despite being busy and the server (Calvin) was really helpful getting us situated with the menu."
1636,NIRIpvQRp4uF-wY_JfJF0A,12/10/2022,4 star rating,"Short review: Pricey but tasty Basque spot. A bit loud. Good vermouth cocktail. Recommending the Láminas de Setas/King Oyster Mushroom Carpaccio heavily. They loved the octopus/pulpo also. Cochinillo/Roasted Suckling Pig is probably the most substantial dish but I preferred the Arroz Meloso/Bomba Rice with Seafood.I was here with several others perhaps a month ago or so to this nice Basque restaurant. As this place is known for tapas (or really pinchos/pintxos as it's Basque,) another person and I know decided to share some of the larger dishes from the specials board with her and we ordering separate appetizers. The place was a bit loud as it was very crowded but I was fine. The staff here was friendly and knowledgeable knowing what dishes contained certain allergens and also gave recommendations. I started with a cocktail which I cannot remember the name of but I think it was either $16 or $18 and it was the first one or second one listed on the menu from the vermouth section. It was white vermouth based and it contained an olive which was unique and it had a nice mix of bitterness and sweetness and I would recommend it for those who prefer a more bitter cocktail. I started with what was eventually my favorite dish of the night, the Láminas de Setas or King Oyster Mushroom Carpaccio. This consisted of said mushrooms along with Marcona almonds, tomato and Idiazabal cheese. This had a wonderful earthiness with the sliced almonds adding a good crunch. The cheese had a good saltiness. Apparently this dish used to be on the specials menu and I can see why they added it. The other person had the Pulpo/Octopus Carpaccio with citrus and piment d'espelette (or Espelette pepper) and that was $21. They liked it a lot commenting on it having a good texture and it was also well presented. The dishes came with thin sliced bread. Another person got the Jamón con Melon with Cinco Jotas paleta, melon de sapo (or Christmas melon,) and chicatana-espelette salt for $26 which they liked.From the specials, we went with the Cochinillo or Crispy Suckling Pig and the Arroz Meloso or Buttery Bomba Rice. The former was $38 and said large piece of pork was on top of a small amount of tximitxurri (or chimichurri) and there was a simple frisée on the side. The pork was rich and flavorful while the chimichurri was definitely a lot milder then versions I've had in some Argentine places being a little bit less garlicky for instance which left it a bit too rich. There also wasn't enough of it being very lightly put on the plate. This was combined with the fact that the salad wasn't strong enough to balance as there was no dressing. I preferred the rice (for $31) which was served like a risotto. Said dish had uni, matsutake mushrooms, wild shrimp, and tomato. The rice had a wonderful texture with a pronounced seafood and tomato flavor. There was an occasional fun texture from the shrimp and mushroom with the only real complaint seeing that it was a little too salty and the delicate uni was a little bit overpowered. The food here was solid though pricey with very good flavors and spices. The presentation of the dishes are also wonderful and I think you partially pay for that (also likely from the Spanish imports.) Particularly good smaller plates but the mains weren't too shabby either. Low 4."

It's in my neighborhood and always loved their suckling pig.I walked in to a half empty restaurant just before 7, and was squeezed in at the bar. I sat there and sat there. No water no menu. Someone else walked in with a bar reservation and was immediately asked what he would like to drink and given a menu, Shocked I walked out!I rarely leave less than a three star review and feel badly but this was my experience Thursday.Happy to export I went back and though the bar is small, the food is mega flavorful. Ate:Cod pil pil plus tomato granitaTotal: $56 with tipCod was poached to perfection & tomatoes very flavorful as they do in Basque Country though I might pick for more local tomatoes. A few slices of bread made for a delightfully delicious dinner."

A Basque tapas bar, Txikito is absolutely amazing (please totally disregard any of the older reviews) with great combinations and flavors that burst in your mouth. Truly amazing food."
1640,NIRIpvQRp4uF-wY_JfJF0A,2/6/2023,3 star rating,"Food is good... but what they call ""snacks"" (their version of appetizers) are extremely tiny. I ordered 2 plates, which had 2 tiny skewers on each plate. I ordered a cocktail but it was only 50% filled with lots of ice cubes. I thought that was hilarious and odd.... The dish with artichoke had really fibrous parts where I could not chew through the whole piece.. had to eventually swallow since I didn't wanna spit it out on the table."
1641,NIRIpvQRp4uF-wY_JfJF0A,10/15/2022,5 star rating,This is a long time favorite of ours. We were glad to see that they were open again and survived the pandemic. Had several of the small snack skewers tonight including the Jida and Hilda as well as the special--crispy suckling pork. We sat at the bar and the bartender was super attentive. Excellent sherry.
1642,NIRIpvQRp4uF-wY_JfJF0A,10/15/2022,5 star rating,"My partner and I got a mix of snacks, cold plates, and hot plates and were delighted. The snacks are admittedly very small for the price, but we're well worth it. We ended up ordering a second round after devouring the first. The cold and hot plates were larger -- not entree sized, but reasonable. This is not a typical tapas place, and anyone coming expecting the typical mix of tapas dishes will likely leave disappointed. If you are looking for something different, however, this place is fantastic!"
1643,NIRIpvQRp4uF-wY_JfJF0A,10/13/2022,1 star rating,The food is alright. Nothing worth its prices. In fact it's extremely overpriced for what it is. The plates are insanely small. The food also takes too long to come out. The waiters don't come by enough. Complimentary bread would've been nice considering everything is so expensive. If you are looking to eat a solid meal do not come here.
1644,NIRIpvQRp4uF-wY_JfJF0A,8/9/2019,5 star rating,"I had recently traveled to Spain and was really missing Spanish food, so I picked Txikito to have dinner with some friends. I had the Casco Viejo cocktail (strong!) and we all shared a pitcher of white sangria that was really good (sweet, but not too sweet). The complimentary cod was amazing and might have been my favorite part of the meal. It was simple, but so delicious. Could have eaten it all day. We ordered a bunch of items off the menu and shared everything, including cod croquettes, foie micuit (foie gras terrine), patatas mentaiko (fries with spicy cod roe mayo), arraultza (chorizo, quail egg on top), octopus, squid ribbons, txarripatak (beef tripe, chickpeas, beef tendon, pig ear), and a rice special of the day. All of the dishes were great, but notable items were the foie gras terrine (so tasty and creamy), octopus (super fresh), and the fries (crispy, great mayo, and also because I just love fries).We enjoyed everything and my Spanish food craving was definitely satisfied! Of course, this made me miss Spain even more, but at least I know I can always come back to Txikito for amazing Spanish food.Taste | 4.5Atmosphere | 4Presentation | 4Service | 4OVERALL | 4.5"

1682,1qRlCnjr4V_idaNDysmgmA,11/6/2021,1 star rating,"Absolutely the Worst Subway! I went in on. Saturday afternoon. There was no customers inside. The two Asian ladies were restocking the potato chips behind the counter and didn't acknowledge me for 2 whole minutes. I'm just standing there waiting. Then I order a footlong meatball sub and I ask the lady to cut it in half because I want one half with cucumber and the other half with cheese. Nothing else. Then the older lady said I have to pay for two six inch subs if I want to do it like that. I asked why? They are both meatball and I only want 2 toppings, 1 on each side. If I didn't ask the lady to cut it in half and ask them to put the toppings on each side it would be charged as a footlong. This didn't make sense but the older lady said no. Have to pay as 2 six inch subs. I ended up just buying 1 of the six inch because the younger lady already made the sub. Every other Subway, I'm able to do it this way. Anyway, she is the boss of her business and I will not give them my business anymore."
1683,1qRlCnjr4V_idaNDysmgmA,4/5/2020,1 star rating,"Like others have said on google reviews, the restaurant closed earlier than the hour listed on the website AND on the door itself. My girlfriend and I ordered online and went to pick up our food. Door was locked but we saw 2 employees in there. We knocked but they ignored us. Knocked louder to explain to them that we ordered online already and paid so we were just there to pick it up. The female employee was very nasty and said they were closed. I said but your hours listed on the door says you're still open (we were there at least an hour before closing). She said those were summer hours. She said our order would be canceled automatically since we were unable to pick it up.  It's been a month now. We never got our food or our money back. THANKS FOR STEALING OUR MONEY."
1684,1qRlCnjr4V_idaNDysmgmA,2/28/2020,1 star rating,Restaurant is dirty and smells weird. People that work there are so rude. We went in today and the lady taking our order had an attitude.
1685,WcFSkRTQ5pYqIppWeLVq2g,12/1/2022,5 star rating,"This was my first time at the Comic Strip. Before the show you can grab drinks half off at the bar, all drinks and food is cash only. The host is great, and you def will leave laughing and enjoying the ambiance of the fun and very Instagram ready environment - from the wall of famous comedians who visited the Stip, to the drinks. I would recommend the Rum Punch and the Pretzel! I am def going back!"
1686,WcFSkRTQ5pYqIppWeLVq2g,3/14/2023,2 star rating,"I will start by saying I have been a returning customer, and a number of times at that, so there have been good acts and it has been worth coming. However, the last three times I went, the comedians were awful, equating to awkward silence and dead stares. Painful to watch. What's worst is that some were repeated comedians from last times I have been, so not only was it awkwardly painful to watch the first time, but apparently managment didn't get the memo because they were back on stage with a similar act. Why? ! I went this past Saturday evening for the 8pm show. Placed was packed. Tables were cramped together. I'm not a ""social distancing COVID crazy"", but it was just not comfortable. Worst margarita, but also not sure why I ordered that! This is not the place for that sort of ordering, and I knew that when I ordered. Stick to beer or wine. There are some food items, like pretzels, and popcorn, nachos, etc...You should eat before you go. Lastly, there were mic audio issues throughout the night, so hearing was a challenge in the back. Show is about $20-25 bucks a person, and then it's a 2 drink minimum per person. Typical price for a comedy club in Manhattan. Location is convenient and near several good restaurants. I think Saturday was my last visit. I likely won't return."
1687,WcFSkRTQ5pYqIppWeLVq2g,12/24/2022,1 star rating,Not funny at all.Waste of time !! None of the performers had funny jokes. Kept asking stupid questions a trying to make something out of. Disaster.

1689,WcFSkRTQ5pYqIppWeLVq2g,10/10/2022,3 star rating,"Went to see a friend perform and he did great. I also liked 2 or 3 more acts that were very funny and had really good jokes. Service was great and the guy at the door was very friendly. The interior was cozy and all the tables have an unobstructed view. I definitely liked the younger performers much more, because their jokes were not inspired by the race, religion or nationality of their audience, they had genuinely funny stories about personal experiences or really smart jokes. It seemed like the older performers thought insulting and targeting their audience was funny. So, I was having a great time until I wasn't. I would probably come back to see specific comics but definitely felt mistreated and did not appreciate that kind of humor. Other than that the overall experience was good. Drinks were well made, prices were higher than the average place in the neighborhood, they are a cash only establishment so consider it before going, beer goes from $10 to $13 and cocktails start a $16. I had the Apple martini and it was good."
1690,WcFSkRTQ5pYqIppWeLVq2g,6/27/2022,4 star rating,"What a fun night!!!  Good comedians the night I was there.  Comedy clubs are hit or miss and it was a hit and a great evening of laughs.The Comic Strip is in Yorkville on 81st and 2nd.   Buy a Groupon for $10, it covers entrance for 2 and call ahead for reservations.  2 drink minimum once you're inside.  Food and drinks are a bit pricey but it's worth it for a nice evening out.  Inside could be a little cleaner."
1691,WcFSkRTQ5pYqIppWeLVq2g,10/31/2022,4 star rating,"Cash only!!! Make sure you bring cash! There was a 2 item minimum for the show that I was at. The space is pretty large. The night I went, the show started at 8pm and 7-10 comics went on. I'm pretty sure it was supposed to end at 10pm but it wasn't over at 10:45pm when we decided to leave.  I'd definitely go back! Nice to have a comedy club like this on the UES!"
1692,WcFSkRTQ5pYqIppWeLVq2g,12/16/2022,1 star rating,Comic Strip Live is complicit in perpetuating rape culture. Their 8pm show on December 6th featured a closer who not only made a rape joke in his set but also felt the need to insult me personally after it was clear I didn't find sexual assault amusing. This middle aged male comedian also thought it was hilarious and clever to say that all women have body image issues. I will not be returning to a venue that continues to book individuals who contribute to a harmful stereotype in the comedy industry. Save your money and give your business to a comedy venue that respects women.
1693,WcFSkRTQ5pYqIppWeLVq2g,6/8/2022,3 star rating,"My husband lived in NYC for 6 years and we L O V E D coming here. And still do! The comedians are amazing, always some notable names and backgrounds. That's the only reason I'm giving it a 3. I hope they receive this feedback, but it was really a letdown. The drinks are so very weak and so expensive. I get it, it's New York. But I asked for a dirty martini and the server said ""I don't think we can make it, let me ask"". A dirty martini is as simple as it gets. When she brought it back, it was just straight olive juice. Very little and not very notable liquor at all. I believe that could be the reason they don't like making those drinks...We also got the espresso martinis, literally all espresso. I finally resorted to a wine (after I returned the dirty martini) and got my husband a bottled beer. My wine was fine, his beer was not cold. LOL!Anyway, love this place, definitely recommend going. But I hope they can stop being so stingy on the drinks. People love going to Comedy Clubs for the drinks and to let loose!"

There was a stacked lineup and a lot more hits than misses. Not every comedian is for everyone and I totally get that, but they had such a variety that we really had a lot to laugh at and so did the entire sold out room. The drinks are pricey and they don't joke around about the 2 item minimum per person, they charged me $8 for a seltzer we didn't order because we only had 3 items total instead of 4 which kind of was lousy but other than that it was a solid night!"

1729,9BBynFMoEWdXzsQZcREq0w,11/29/2019,3 star rating,"Lately , everytime i go, they are complaining the business is down. I am gonna tell you why! They started to charge you for credit card  fees as well. I left a big compliant about that to Crossbay diner. Credit card fees belong to the establishments, NOT TO THE CUSTOMER. Think about it, customers pay tax ( thats a must! ), gotta a leave the tip to server. Now i gotta pay for the credit card fee too! Even it is a couple of bucks, that adds up right. People will think not twice, three times to go out and eat. For the short term, business might think that they got away with it, but in the long term, businesses like this won't survive.Let's come to my breakfast. It is the most important meal of the day. I am a complainer, i know that, but don't give me any extra reason to complain more. And you can learn from my perspective! I ordered eggs over easy with corned beef hash, fries and gravy. My eggs were over cooked, server got me new ones. It is not corned beef hash, IT WAS CORNED MUTTON. To me I don't care, i eat goat cheese and not a lot of people eat that. Mutton has a distinct taste, not everyone will appreciate that. Fires were good, but, gravy was too thick, probably from over night, needs to be loose and water down. Now, I don't need to ask my server every time, change this, change that. Before you serve it to me, you gotta make sure if you can eat that, or would you like to be served that kind a dish!!"

Around 4:30/5 on Saturday October 22. There were about four other tables in the whole diner with customers, a lot of staff sitting around.  The gentleman acknowledged us he was wearing glasses very polite and sat us towards the left of the diner behind the register.  The table on the left had a customer a gentleman who just recieved his order.  We ordered a turkey burger deluxe and mozzarella burger deluxe and coffees. The gentleman man sitting toward the right of us complained that there was something in his food a bug a spider I believe the only reason we know this is because he got upset and once he left the staff started complaining in English and Spanish. Our whole meal was hearing them complain about this customer. how they treat  to customers and not friends with their customers and how they always complain. This conversation was between almost four employees three men and one female who was on the phone alot. They stopped for a while then a one of the employees who wore a white tshirt and was mopping I believe continued literally while standing a three away from us. Talking about customers and the gentleman in piticular and Whst he found on his plate.  As another customer I don't want to hear about what May have been found on a persons plate.   My turkey burger tasted like the meat was soaked in only vinegar. The fries were over done and I was even afraid to say something cause the were already talking about the other customer.  When we paid I asked the woman to please let me know when the regular managers would be there so I can address the concerns.  I have been a customer at this diner for more then two decades I live in the area an go once in a while.  I have never had issues like this before but I don't feel comfortable going back alone cause if the food but the staff training on how to deal with customers is not there anymore. Being a Spanish person I understood completely there whole conversation and it's not right to do while staff is there"

The bacon egg and cheese was bland. Ask for a toasted roll, not toasted. Coffee was luke warm. Told the server it was cold and he replied would you like some hot water in it. Like, what? The hot water for our tea was also Luke warm. Think they need to get their coffee machine fixed. The silverware were spotty and not the cleanest. The waffle was good. Now, this is where it went down hill. There were flies flying about and There was literally a ROACH! - crawling around the booth across us. They called the server over and he said ...

1736,FiKu5C03pBiAn5v5DEL9UQ,3/12/2023,4 star rating,"I came here with my family for a weekend brunch. Tucked in the heart of the West Village, this vegetarian place suits quite well with the vibes of the neighborhood. Sometimes, it's not about how great the food is, but whether the vibes are right. As is typical with city brunch spots, this place is PACKED on weekends. You'll need a reservation. We got a reservation that we couldn't even push back. Seating is very tight inside, so good luck bringing more than 4 people here. There is some seating outside, though I have no idea how long that'll stay up in the future.Because it's busy, service can take a little longer than usual. Ours wasn't that bad. My sister & I ordered juices while my parents ordered Chai & coffee. I ordered the seasonal Antlers Aglow as it was a seasonal drink. It was something I wouldn't normally order, but it was solid. The ginger can be much for some taste buds, but it didn't bother me.We ordered the following main course items to share:1) French Toast Casserole: This was quite good. My dad enjoyed it as it was nice and sweet. It was a large portion too, so we didn't even get to finish it. 5/52) Surfer's Breakfast Bowl: It's a solid bowl. Not very heavy. I think the chorizo crumble can feel a bit too dry, especially if you're not used to that type of taste (I definitely am not!). I wonder if it could use a spicy item in there to make it a bit more savory. Maybe, maybe not? We weren't able to finish this in full. 4/53) The Best Egg Sandwich: This was pretty good. I'm not the biggest croissant fan, but can see people loving this. The difference to me is the harissa aioli. We ended up finishing this.  5/54) Butcher's Burger: This was probably our favorite. Nice and filling burger with the perfect condiments. I think the sweet potato wedges are a good idea in theory, but should have been a bit crispier. It was quite soft. Additionally, cutting the wedges in half would make it a bit easier to eat. 4.5/5Overall, it's not a bad place if you're not too picky about the taste of certain items."

Epitome of why it's useless to go out to eat these days. POV -- I used to be both a bartender and a server, I didn't particular love either job, but it doesn't cost anything to be polite and smile and be friendly. Customers are rude? Yes! But you don't have to be! My waitress literally rolled her eyes when I asked her a question about the menu. ROLLED HER EYES. Like is that not your job, mam????Actually I'm the sucker who always goes in expecting that the staff will give a S#!T. I think maybe I'm more mad at myself than these silly people! LOLAlso the food is not extraordinary or special. Just good enough. I wish I could give negative stars. No more of my hard earned money is going to go to this place. Enough is enough.

The breakfast sandwich should have come with some form of breakfast potato and was severely underseasoned. The breakfast bowl was good, but also underseasoned. Their mimosa flights are cute, but I'd rather they have fewer and better flavors. Overall, the prices here are ridiculous for what you get.The last annoying thing here was the service and ambience. I was in a group of 6 that got seated in their patio ""tent-like"" seating. It was wayyyy too small of a space for 6 people and we were 6 tiny people. It was also incredibly hot. Like a greenhouse. Service was slow in that no one approached our table for a while and they did not visit nearly often enough. Especially since the table got crowded quickly due to 6 people's worth of drinks and food.

It is a bit pricey. I do remember paying over $40 for our visit.Although it was delicious, I don't know that I'd come again. I can find plenty of locations that can provide plant-based faire for much cheaper, but if you want ambiance & cool vibes, this is the place.

I actually did not realize that it was plant based (the name is deceiving but cute).I met a friend here for breakfast/brunch and wanted something on the lighter side so I opted for the avocado toast -loved it! So simple but fresh Ingredients made for a tasty snack. It was a little expensive for the portion size but hey, it's nyc, baby. My friend got the egg sandwich and also really loved hers. Definitely go for the sandwich if you want something with more substance. For drinks, I tried their coffee and my friend got one of their smoothies. She was not a fan of the smoothie but I actually really liked it. I can't remember the name, but it was white and tasted a little like a protein shake. They have seating indoor and outdoor and also have the parklets set up sirloin. Loved being able to enjoy the great weather in the parklet while still having a break from the cold. I'd for sure come back."

While it was petty cold it was better than nothing.The service was not super attentive but once we got the server's attention everything came out relatively quickly.While the restaurant is vegetarian, there are plenty of dishes that can be made vegan, they also accommodate a gluten-free diet as well.Butcher's Daughter is kind of a staple of the vegetarian dining scene in New York so it's worth checking out if you haven't been before."

Their tom yum (which for some reason is listed as chicken lemongrass soup) from said lunch special is quite good with some pieces of meaty chicken and some mushrooms. My preference for their main dish on the lunch special is the workingman's noodles. For an entrée, I've gotten the same as well as the road duck panang which was tasty. I prefer the spot heavily over Lemongrass nearby though I think this is because the service at the other spot feels very surly and I found the noodles better here."

The calamari was nicely seasoned and tasty, not oily. I highly recommend their drunken noodles w/ shrimp. WOW! I was surprised how delicious it was. I haven't eaten a good drunken noodle for a while. It was well seasoned, savory, and the shrimp was cooked the right way (it was al dente, not soggy). The fried snapper was well seasoned and crispy.

Was here in the afternoon, so was able to take advantage of the lunch specials. You can get a soup or salad, and a noodle or rice dish for anywhere from $8.95 to $12.95 (depending on your protein). What a deal!I got the chicken lemongrass soup (delicious and fully loaded) with the Workingman's Noodles (stir fried with bok choy, egg, and I chose chicken). Also piping hot and delicious. I had to explain the concept of wok hay to my Caucasian friend (for reference: guide.michelin.com/en/ar…) and I can tell you, they produce it in spades.Of course, we had a couple of rounds of $3 Singha's (best deal in town!) and just killed some time on a lazy afternoon.

Even the one time in Thailand I got food poisoning, I couldn't complain because the street food was damn delicious and worth the sickness.However, Cafe Chili doesn't quite reach subpar and was a poor dining experience. Located in busy Court street, other restaurants were bustling and this one was deserted, so we wanted to support them and give them business. By the end of the meal, it made sense why it was haunted. I do want to say that the restaurant itself is really cute and has a nice backyard. The staff was extremely nice, which is why it's sad the food was upsetting. The Chef's Specialty volcano chicken is literally chicken nuggets on top of a bed of yellow lettuce. It's like something I would get in McDonald's, except McDonald's would've cost 10% of the price and frankly, it was insulting to be served this as a ""special"" dinner entree. My friend had pad Thai with chicken, which has 6 pieces of chicken and is a classic Thai dish that's hard to ruin. The waitress was friendly, but didn't refill water once, even though at 8PM we were the only people dining there. The whole thing was odd and disappointing. Dinner came out to $60 for 2 entrees and an appetizer, and I went home hungry because I would've vomited if I finished the rest of my chicken nugget dinner."

Some of the more seasoned employees are extremely friendly and will treat you with respect but then there are younger employees who are only there for a check and will surely make you feel like you are imposing on their life just by ordering. I've been coming here for over 3 years and came here today on Thanksgiving to having a wait for 30 minutes for turkey. What is that all about? I usually tip the employees that make my plate and cash me out, but not with the nasty attitudes and paltry servings.  Hopefully when I go back at another time, everything will be remotely back to normal with less attitude and more gratitude."

Service was good and the food was great! We ordered the Gnocchi con Crema Al Tartuffo and the Chicken Parmiggiana. Definitely recommend the Gnocchis, very creamy and tasty! The chicken Parm was very good but the Spaghettis were average and a little over cooked. The drinks were a little disappointing I would come back!!"
1776,M4pCWzdBCkp2g_d834a7Hw,1/15/2023,4 star rating,"It took a little bit of time, but I finally got out to the Lower East Side to try this well-known restaurant. If it has Sauce in the name, then it must be known to try the food with said sauce.I gathered some Intel before coming here to try and get an idea of what I was getting myself into, and $70 later (three items worth), I have an idea.The calamari is splendid. Whether you want to share it, or have a hungry person eat it solo, it works well. It is not dense, or undercooked, rather it is cooked almost perfectly. I enjoyed eating this.The Italian sausages are nothing to write home about. You get one of each, one that is mild and one that is spicy. Neither one had me jumping for joy. Instead, I felt frustrated that these things are expensive, for anybody's standards.Then came my entree, the rigatoni with meatballs. The rigatoni is slightly overcooked, and you only get two meatballs, even though they are good, two meatballs is two meatballs. It is not a generous portion of food, but I need more than two meatballs to feel satisfied.How about that sauce? Well, how about it? It actually is a good sauce, comparing to Paulie's sauce from, ""Goodfellas"" would be putting it too highly, but to say it is cheap tomato paste would be putting it down. It works well with any dish because it is not an overly heavy sauce. Some sauces are rich and heavy, but this one is light and subdued, only coming out when you really lather it on. By the time I left the restaurant, between the sauce and the lighting, I was seeing red.There is no free bread here. I will deduct points for that. Put some free bread with the sauce on the table and customers will never want to leave.The profane early 2000's hip hop music also blared the whole time. After a while it got old, proving that this is not a family restaurant. Nonna would not be happy with that, despite the tasty sauce Nonna creates here.I guess the red lighting could be done away with too. It was highly uncomfortable.Despite all the negativity, I am giving it four stars simply because the sauce lives up to the name of the restaurant, and in the end, that is all that matters."

I have been around to many various restaurants of different types, but Sauce is above all because of the total package it provides:1. The pizza is some of the best in the city and the paper-thin crust gives the pizza a unique texture that is unmatched. I always order the Vodka pie and the White pie with hot honey, a combo that is truly unmatched2. The vibes in there are some of the best I've ever had at a sit-down restaurant. The music is on point and the attitude of the servers is incredible. Every time I've been to Sauce, I've been impressed by the quality of the serviceEvery time I have a guest in the city, I make sure Sauce is on our list. Come and you will not be disappointed."

I had heard a lot about their pizza so ordered the vodka and upside down pie. The service was quick and we got our pizzas very soon which was great. The slices are so so thin which is cool but the sauce lacked flavor. The vodka one was too salty and barely had any other taste. The other upside down slice was filled with oregano, it was a lot. Super disappointed with the pizzas there."

The paper thin crust just makes the pizza! The service was very nice and fast, and the food came out very quickly. On a Friday night, this place was very lively and a fun atmosphere! If you're looking to have a nice pizza party, this is the spot!"

Walked in and the front seating area was empty, the waitress walked us to the back and there were some diners so we felt at ease.

Very very heavy on the black pepper so it wasn't my favorite and it felt a little heavyMy boyfriend has the grass fed beef bolognese with sausage on the side. He said it was good and very much filling. The sausage came 1 sweet Italian and 1 spicy. Sangria was okay, a little bitter and I had a glass of red Restrooms gender neutral and very clean"

The truffle gnocchi and vodka pie were both their most popular dishes and upon first bite of both it was super clear why! The truffle gnocchi is the most decadent and melt in your mouth pasta Ive had. The vodka pie was a solid effort and everything you want in a thin crust pizza!

The crust is very thin so you can share a pie as an appetizer and not be over stuffed. We also had the spaghetti with Bolognese sauce.  It was amazing.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive and the atmosphere was great. When you walk in you are overwhelmed by the amazing smell of Sauce!    Also, highly recommended the Tiramisu which is large enough for two."

I haven't been back here since 2016 or so and it's even better! We ordered food and went in family style. Service was great - there was a delay in our drink selections that they brought out appetizer on the house to accompany us. Duck lasagna was so good but the lobster Mac and cheese was heavenly. We also ordered the porterhouse for two for four people and we were full that we had to skip dessert. Vibe check passes. Think this is a solid place to take friends!"
1786,qpkFmGyvbZv-g2fbwyNQUg,3/12/2023,4 star rating,I was surprised by how good the steaks are. The steaks are different from the butter drenched styles of Peter Lugers and Benjamin's. Its more dry aged and clean and lean tasting. I liked it but it might not be for you if you like the butter drenched versions.Appetizers and sides were all great. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is the service is painfully slow. The steaks came out about 30 mins after we finished the apps. Basically the steaks came out an hr and a half into dinner.

My friends got the ribeye and I loved theirs as well!For dessert, we got the cast iron chocolate chip cookie and WOW this may be my new fave dessert. The cookie is so warm and comes with vanilla ice cream and caramel drizzle. PLEASE GET THIS. I am already missing it, wanting another."

We started with oysters, shrimp cocktail, homemade ricotta, meatballs, and the bacon. Don't sleep on the ricotta!! As far as entrees, everyone enjoyed their filets and I personally loved the octopus. Mac an cheese (very rich) and brussel sprouts are good sides to get! Don't skip out on dessert - get the warm baked cookie! The only issue (which wasn't much of an issue but more of a nuance) we encountered was they were limited on the wine we ordered and only had 2 bottles in house of what we preferred."

We have been to many steakhouses around the city but none were as impressive as BMC. We enjoyed the presentation of the cuts and the hospitality of the wait staff. We ordered the 100 day dry aged NY strip steak with truffle butter and whipped potato. It was rich and flavorful, I'm sure any cut you order will be amazing. The hamachi crudo was delicate and citrusy. I highly recommend the meatballs served with polenta as an appetizer."

They were also able to seat us early even though they were booked that night. The service was incredible from the moment we entered and our server was fabulous! Answered all questions and made great recommendations. The Ricotta was brought to us complimentary! The food was delicious flavorful and excellent quality! From the salad, steak, clams and everything else all were a hit at the table. We left full, happy, and very impressed! I highly recommend this place.

I was in Dyker Heights to look at the lights and dropped in for a bite. Things are not quite the same since Tom passed away. Tom was an eccentric man, but very likable. If you are going don't expect great food. Tommaso's kitchen is mediocre at best, order simply and go with low expectation's. There are two reason's to visit. Reason number one is the extraordinary wine list, and reason number two is live opera. I found a 2001 Chateau Pontet-Canet on the list for only $100. The evening's featured opera singer was pretty good too. I will also mention that there are occasional ""characters"" dining in Tommaso's. They mind their own business and so do I."

The breadcrumbs were toasted perfectly and the clams were plump and juicy and not at all chewy. For my main I got Italian sausage and broccolirabe.  The sausages were good but just a bit dry and the Rabe was also good. Not tough as it sometimes can be and very garlicky. My co-worker got Chicken Parmigiana and I tried some and it was a very good version of this Italian American standard. The breading was light and the sauce was quite good.   Finished it off with a solid Cappucino and my childhood fave Tortoni. We left saying yeah this place  will now be on our return list.

If you're in the area, especially during lunchtime, pop in and take advantage of their lunch special and grab some tacos or any of their other offerings. Their customer service could use some work. It's a hit or miss and it all depends on who's working the front during that time. On one of my visits, I ordered a side of guac and was assured it was in the bag. When I got to my destination, it was not. Reached out to them and got an attitude from the young lady who took the order."

The gyro meat flavor was not that good and I wasn't used to this kind of rice with it. I had to pour the tzatziki sauce on to make it better. Would come back for the falafel though."

I have been to their New Jersey location. However, I was not going to wait an hour for a bagel I could get elsewhere for less time. Fortunately, Bagel Road does that, even if if that means it is more money.No, it is not the best bagel out there, far from it. But the spreads are fresh, the bagels are a nice size (albeit awkwardly shaped), and the people were nice. The bagels are a tad bland, but there is just enough flavor to get by without it feeling like a boring piece of bread. What does this shop have that Bagel Boy does not? Except maybe a deal for a dozen. As for anything else, I got two muffins. Except they are not muffins, they are murder weapons. These things tasted so hard that you could crack someone's head open with them. I had to only eat the top and throw the rest of it away for my own safety.If bagels are what you are after, this one can be pressed in to service and do the job without garnering too much fuss."

They have a nice selection of omelettes that a regular there told me are good. Iced coffee was fresh but a bit too sweet for my liking. Service is very slow but there's less people then bagel boy so you'll be out quicker. Don't even bother trying the juice. I once got it because I was there getting a bagel but I had wished I just went to overgreens instead.I think their prices are a bit on the pricey side considering value, quality, service, flavor etc. iced coffee was $2.25, bagels are $1.50 each, I think the bacon egg and cheese is $5 and the tacos are $7 for two. I only go here when I'm pressed on time and I think they know that about their customers lol but that's how this industry is. Some people thrive just off the foot traffic."

On this particular night we stopped in for my friend's 23rd birthday. The bartender met us with apprehension and a face like serving us was the last thing on Earth he wanted to do. He refused to serve us til he had every single one of our ID's in hand. Studied them for a while and then finally gave them back. Each one of use who ordered was met with what seemed to be disdain and annoyance at the plight of having to serve us.After I bought myself and my friend a drink to meet the $15 MINIMUM, I left a really really small tip on my card. Sure I know it's usually a common courtesy to tip somewhat well but - Sorry! Moneys tight right now, for literally everyone! Can't pretend like we're not all experiencing it - and on top of that buddy you get what you earn! The bartender then took my tip out in change, tracked me back to my table with my friends, confirmed it was me and THREW THE CHANGE AT ME. Then he told me not to bother ordering for the rest of the night because he wouldn't serve me.If zero stars were possible I'd probably leave that, but the back was Star Wars themed which I really liked. So I'll give them that. Long story short: Come here if you want a good happy hour deal but to be treated like shit!"

It's a few steps up from a dive, but it does have an older crowd, long time regulars, and they play rock. I remember REM, Alice in Chains, and some blues. It's unpretentious, well worn, and full of fun and interesting people. Their happy hour runs till 8pm and they have rock albums over the bar, I remember seeing Abbey Road. A big window at the front with bar stools lets you watch the masses roam by. There are two back rooms, a larger one with tables and Yoda peeking out of a treehouse, and a smaller one in the back with arched wooden church doors that opens up into a cozy nook with a couch and bookcase. It was that little room I found myself in, having a spirited discussion with four other strangers about everything from family to science to documentaries to psychology and philosophy. It had the feeling of a meeting house from a different place and time, when bars and cafes were places to share ideas and talk about life. And yeah, they police the jukebox. I understand why some might hate this, but every other bar is playing the same type of music all over town and music is the tried and true way to ensure you don't become an overcrowded hell hole full of ""oonce oonce"" sounds and woo-people."

If happens to stop by this place I recommend not to order a cocktail because he literally doesn't know anything about it. Just order a beer he definitely knows how to pour it. He pretended to know how to make a cocktail and got mad at us just because we explained that was the wrong way. Avoid this place at all costs.

Despite being way over twenty one he gave my group problems when we two steps into the place.Yeah bud, I know you need to check my id. But let me settle in before you start hollering at me.  When we gave him our ids, he thought they were fake until I ""proved I was born in 1993."" Obscure 90s trivia is my thing even if I wasn't 25 but good on ya anyway, mate. What can I tell ya, black don't crack.We got a table on the upper part, which was lovely. The bar is divey but charming. There were a couple people using the jukebox and jamming. The bartender continued to be a twat until his set of regulars left. Either they told him he was being a jerk or he was showing of for his set of friends. Maybe by the end of the night I was just being cheeky back because the amount of disrespect was laughable.It seems like they are trying to detour a younger crowd, many younger yelpers seem to also have problems with the bartender accepting their id and being rude.It's a chill spot if you can manage dealing with him. There is no food here, but they let you order in. I won't based on how much of a dick the staff is here."

Divey, but good.If you're walking by and not paying attention, you might miss the entrance to this bar. You'll need to walk up some stairs to get to the bar area. There are some window seats overlooking the street below and seating in the back as well, but both times, we opted to sit closer to the bar. It's pretty dark in there so you might have some trouble reading the blackboard with drink specials - fear not. I got you:HH is from 5 to 8 which is pretty good for the city, considering most bars have a HH that ends at 7. This makes Greenwich Treehouse the go-to spot to drink for cheap. The selection is pretty good - lots of beers on tap and if you are feeling fancy, they carry Wolffer's Rose Cider. Well drinks are discounted during HH too."

The bar is small but you can still move around without spilling half of your drink all over yourself. Some of the bartenders were a bit snippy and others were awesome - also typical of most bars.The best part about Greenwich Treehouse is that there is a back room you can rent for free. It is a perfect spot to rent out (free!) for a larger group gathering (20+). The room has a big table, bathrooms, another small room with couches, arcade games, and bar access. The bar access is perfect for ordering your own drinks without having to worry about waiter service/splitting a bill a million ways. I am not sure how much beer and wine is, but Titos/Espolon and sodas were $11 each. Overall this is a solid bar and a good spot for a big group if you're looking to book a space for casual drinks."

I love my drinks on the sweeter side and they went out of their way to sweeten up my drink for me as well as re-make a drink at one point.They were also giving us the 411 on trivia which was much appreciated.Vibe: 5/5Chill vibe as expected from your local dive bar. I didn't expect much because the place seemed pretty quiet on a Sunday afternoon but I wasn't complaining. The patio seemed to be popping though. We sat inside and there's so much to do from board games and shuffleboard. My favorite thing about this place are the old album cores on the wall and the polaroid pictures all around!

The beer was so flat, there wasn't even bubbles. Like, colored water. We decided to just leave, because the bar was closing and we already paid. On our way out, we brought our drinks to the bar and mentioned that the beer was flat, and wasn't really drinkable. We weren't asking for a refund or even another drink, we just wanted them to know so they could put on a new keg for the next customer. The bartender was so rude, it was like we had offended her. It was super bizarre...We've been here a couple of times and the drinks were always okay and they have a backyard area (nothing special, just a few tables outside) but the bartenders were always sort of unfriendly.Overall, I love a cheap, affordable local bar, but I don't like undrinkable beer and unfriendly people. I would recommend walking a few blocks down the street to another local place."

I'm a typical Yelper who researches a biz thoroughly before planning a visit, and so I don't stumble into places often, but it would be accurate to say I dashed into this bar simply because it was there, and because it was pouring rain outside. I'm happy to say it was just the sort of watering hole our group was looking for.If I'm remembering correctly, there were a string of holiday lights still hung up when we visited in June. This lack of care for the decor is kind of what makes a dive bar like this charming, or maybe the lights are there intentionally year round. Either way, the beer and shot specials, cheap beers on tap, slightly sticky floors and string lighting make this a totally welcoming, no frills bar to grab a few drinks with to go with great conversation. We visited on a rainy day when few other patrons were inside, but I can imagine some good people watching can be had here."

Additionally, rejected one of us for having a temporary ID from the DMV. Which for the record can be accepted at bars as a legitimate form of ID. Ultimately, he ruined our entire night which was supposed to be a wonderful birthday celebration. Once inside, with two friends down due to the militant security efforts by said bouncer, we saw the bar wasn't exceptionally busy but waited upwards of 10+ minutes to be acknowledged for a drink.

For some reason delivery isn't always guaranteed, especially when their restaurant doesn't do dine-in service since the pandemic. Some days they do pick-up only, which is really annoying because for someone like me who has to get on a bus to get there to pick up the food. Or someone who has a disability and can't get out of their house. Or someone with COVID-19 isolating. This is really unacceptable, unprofessional, and not deserving of a delivery fee. When this place finally gets their act together I'll be a regular customer again, but for the time being I'd rather avoid this place."

The sauce used worked well.  I ordered a few different sushi rolls.  I must admit the sushi rolls were very fresh, even for late at night.

I think because the fruit also contribute sweetness in the drink so even it was just 30% sugar level, the drink is a bit too sweet to me. What I did is to have some of the tea then keep adding water in the cup. Therefore, I'm able to have the fruit tea for the whole afternoon. Lol"

1879,gMVFC--iXd29dM6QTMbp3w,6/25/2022,5 star rating,"If you want to find the most authentic Taiwanese bubble tea in LIC, look no further! We dropped by on a Saturday afternoon and it was the perfect spot to help us cool off from the 90 degree weather. We ordered the red bean sago latte and passion fruit green - the sago was perfectly chewy and fresh, and both drinks were well balanced in flavor (read: not too sweet)! Compared to so many other spots in Manhattan that are over priced with soggy boba, Yi Fang is a god sent! Last minute we also got the strawberry milk tea with sago and it was surprisingly super light and very refreshing as well!"
1880,gMVFC--iXd29dM6QTMbp3w,5/21/2022,2 star rating,"This is my second time going to this chain. The first time in Chinatown, I thought was a flop -- being that the Passionfruit Green Tea just tasted like sugar water. I tried another flavor this time -- the Lugu Oolong Tea, and it the same issue occurred. I got grass jelly topping -- and the jelly was extremely over cooked and had a weird baby food mushy texture. Really unfortunate, especially considering the fact that the drinks range from $5 on the cheapest end and $8-9 on the pricier end. Each topping is also $1-2.Note that this location requires a $10 card minimum and so essentially anyone who buys a single drink will have to bring cash."

I made an obligatory 12pm stop on Sunday, right when they opened. The interior is similar to the other Yi Fangs. This one is quite spacious. Typically I order the traditional fruit teas. This time I went for the matcha. The bubbles were freshly made and chewier."

1884,gMVFC--iXd29dM6QTMbp3w,1/28/2022,3 star rating,"This place is such a mixed bag and here's why: the drinks they make are pretty good taste wise BUT everytime I go, they're out of some ingredient. This time was probably the worst I've experienced. They didn't have any drinks with taro, mango, Yakult, orange, or red bean plus a handful of drinks. If you take a look at the menu, that's almost half of the entire menu. I kept going up to order and then getting told ""sorry we don't have that"" x3!!!!! I feel like fundamentally a restaurant needs to have all its ingredients -- that's like the bare minimum. So, I'm pretty sad. Also I came at like 5:30 PM, so there's no excuse for like ""running out close to closing"". I came here craving a mango sago pomelo and was so disappointed to hear that they basically have nothing. Would be a one star but I'm adding some stars because when they are stocked on ingredients they can make some great drinks. Plz stock up on ingredients Yi Fang!!!!"

Disappointingly, they didn't have Arroz con gandules, so I had to settle with the Arroz morro. The remaining pernil were just shreds of what originally must have been a whole pork shoulder, and I have no way of knowing how old that meat is. Overall, edible food. Not friendly service.

(perhaps the economy?)Overall, the establishment serves very good dominican food.It lacks a higher overall score due to subpar customer service, somewhat stingy servings n inconsistency when it comes to food options.(really a 2.5 due to above, but i had to round if off..lol)There is no competition in the area, so its the obvious choice if you want good spanish food."

Both dishes were ordered to go and were very tasty! The portions were decent and perhaps would have given more if the economy was better (guessing here).Until we find another restaurant, this place would be our go to choice for Spanish food.I'm giving three stars for the food only. The restaurant was kind of dark inside and not too inviting to sit and eat. But the people there didn't stare and the servers were friendly."

May also come with a side of food poisoning. My daughter threw up her lamb gyro tonight ( thanks a lot!, that's exactly what we needed ) and as for me, I left my paid food sitting on their table because it was a burnt chewy mess and swimming in sauce for no reason. Also no one bothered to ask how the food was, as the server was only interested in getting paid for their garbage food. Don't waste your money here."

Sunday night and I really didn't feel like cooking, so I set my heart on the idea of a turkey burger. I really like my turkey burgers with avocado, red onion, lettuce, and mayo. The only problem? I'm a student on a budget, so I'm not looking to spend a fortune. Crave was the lowest price point I was able to find in the Astoria area with all the fixings (their Cali Turkey Burger was precisely what I was looking for), so I ordered right away.My order came right on time (good sign!). The fries were really well-seasoned and I liked the kind of unique little wedge shapes. The burger was cooked well and they were generous with the lettuce, onion, cheddar, and avocado. I also noticed a few other tiny details: they give you a large container of sauce, which I really appreciated, and they also wrap the burger so that the contents don't slide all over the inside of the container during transit. The turkey burger was well-constructed, too. Small touches like that really put a restaurant over the top IMO!Overall great meal. The only thing was I wasn't a huge fan of the cole slaw--there was nothing wrong with it, just wasn't to my taste. I'll definitely turn to this place again when my next turkey burger craving hits!"

There is nothing I would change about this restaurant.When I got delivery it was amazing. When I eat in, it's amazing. Service and servers are great.The fries are a British-style ""chip"" and freaking fantastic. 10/10. Great dips, as well.Actually ordered the aveglomenomo (sp?) soup for the first time and truly, 10/10 again.I love Crave. I moved to Brooklyn in Spring 2019 and never forgot about Crave.

And it's f*gs like you that set our cause back 20 foking years. Get over it. Just because a bartender is blunt or curt with you doesn't automatically mean they're anti-gay. Not everything is about you & your alleged injustices [text deleted for PG audience]..I frequent this place BECAUSE they have alway been accepting of my sexuality (especially when I'm with the many guys I bring in here on ""dates"") and they are never judgmental or rude. If a bar is busy, they're busy. That means patrons, gay or otherwise, gotta wait a little bit longer to get their drink on. It does not automatically mean they're homophobic on any level; that is on YOU. Stop being so god damn insecure about being a f*g and stop foking blaming the world for whatever injustices you may have encountered in your pathetic existence. And just foking own it. Accept it. Embrace it. I never feel less of a person because I am gay. No one should.

1933,kcVNF_8akoJ7-SI8TvGS0g,5/6/2021,5 star rating,This is the definition of a great local bar. The bartenders will remember you after your third visit. The pours are super reasonable. The selection is great (and the staff is super knowledgeable and can recommend great new finds). They have a little something to eat but that isn't the reason to go. They also have great music (all vinyl). I love this little hidden gem for a quick beverage at any time of the day or night.
1934,kcVNF_8akoJ7-SI8TvGS0g,2/10/2018,3 star rating,"I like this place.  They have two taps, a nice selection of beers in cans and bottles, wines, and -- of course -- lots of bourbon.The vibe is cool. They have a record player and lots of jazz records from the '60s.  The place is really small and seating is at a premium.Now, here's the reason I gave three stars.  I walked in and there was no place to sit, but there was room to stand by the drink rail across from the bar.  I pulled out my wallet -- the international sign for ""I want to order.""  The bartender -- a woman -- did not even acknowledge me.  She was chatting with someone who was sitting at the bar who I believe is either an owner, manager, or another employee because he went behind the bar to fetch himself another beer and the bartender did not try to stop him.  I waited well over five minutes before the bartender finally deemed me worthy enough to ask me what I wanted -- not even a ""hello.""This place is too small for customer service to be this bad.  The only way a business with so little square footage is going to survive is if it is known as being a friendly bar.To be fair, another bartender started a shift not longer after I was served -- and able to snag a stool at the bar.  He was much friendlier and appeared to have a fondness for Reese's Pieces, because one of the first things he did when he arrived was to open a bag and pour them into an old fashion glass.  Nothing wrong with that."

My friend got the chicken broth and she said it was okay. But the beef broth was so good, I don't even like pho but I loved this place. Also my husband got this steak skillet , it was really good. He got it with a side of rice.Service was good, our waiter was nice, took them kinda long to get out pho out , but we also came right when they opened.Ambiance is good, tables are spread out, you don't feel like your on top of one another. We paid $110 for 4 people and 1 appetiser, so not bad for dumbo. I will definitely come here again, my favourite Vietnamese place by far."
1936,9I8mZXCkGZBmFh5fYOYorw,3/15/2023,4 star rating,"I stopped by Em's in DUMBO on a cold Saturday evening for a cozy dinner. Prior to my visit, I was already familiar with their original location in Bath Beach. Compared to the food from that location, the DUMBO one had a more fleshed out menu and included a lot of seafood offerings in addition to the classic hits like their pho and vermicelli dishes. We ordered the spring rolls ($11) to start and their beef pho ($17), pork vermicelli ($17), and the beef stew ($20) as well as their mango smoothie ($10) and lemon ginger tea ($4). Their spring rolls were crispy and light and stuffed with chewy glass noodles, soft taro, and crunchy wood-ear mushrooms which gave such a great texture. Their beef pho was a little too sweet for my preference and compared to the other dishes we ordered, kind of just faded into the background. I do enjoy that it was a soup noodle dish which was very warming on the night we visited. The pork vermicelli was served dry with vermicelli noodles, lettuce, cucumber, mint, pickled carrots and daikon, and fried shallots that you toss together with the accompanying nước chấm dipping sauce. Their grilled pork was PHENOMENAL (as a matter of fact, their grilled dishes in general are amazing!) and so juicy and smoky. The beef stew was a really hearty dish and I definitely got beef bourguignon vibes as the stew was quite thick and fragrant. Instead of red wine though, the stew was flavored with lemongrass, ginger, and coconut. The vermicelli noodles were even better when slurped with the stew broth. We also ordered a lemongrass pork chop and broken rice ($19) and another order of spring rolls to-go for someone else which was also very well received. In fact, the smoky fragrance of the pork chops permeated the car the whole ride back. Overall, I think I would like to return to try their bánh xèo and their seafood signatures."
1937,9I8mZXCkGZBmFh5fYOYorw,2/20/2023,4 star rating,A good Viet spot that hits the spot with a simple yet diverse menu. Fried tofu is good but wasn't the most amazing thing. The butter clams were good but not sure if it was worth the price tag. The beef pho is good. Broth is what you would expect. Definitely a spot to revisit if in the area.

This is the type of restaurant for any occasion. The bar seating provides a nice setting for solitary eating as well as small groups. We went on New Year's Day in the evening as a group of 4; the tables were all booked, but there was plenty of seating at the bar. Still, it was not very noisy so it was easy to have a conversation with those around. Our server navigated the area very well, often having to maneuver around the table directly behind us. Bun Thit Nuong (Pork Vermicelli) - An abundance of perfectly crisp grilled pork sat atop lightly seasoned vermicelli noodles, coupled with a small salad of romaine and cucumbers. This dish certainly filled me up. Don't think anything could have made this dish better -- it was great. Cha Gio (Spring rolls) - Crispy, filled with fresh ingredients, and served with a light sweet sauce. Very good! Dau Hu Chien (Crispy Tofu) - Crispy with fluffy tofu inside, these were also very good. Recommend this and the appetizer above! Also ordered a red sangria which was tasty! Value: 5/5Quality: 5/5Quantity: 5/5Service: 5/5Atmosphere: 5/5"

Beef were tender and the ingredients were fresh. I would definitely eat it again. Broth was flavorful!Crispy Tofu: Loved it. Honestly I obsessed with the dipping sauce and I was trying to figure out the ingredients of it so I can attempt to make it at home.Avocado Smoothie: TASTES AS IT SHOULD TASTE!! I always get avocado smoothies at Vietnamese restaurants. If you have not had avocados in a sweet form, just take the leap and order it. You will not regret it.Overall: Highly recommend! I would come back for sure. Anything less than 5 stars would be a disservice to the restaurant. -- That's how strong I feel about this."

I was looking to go to the new ramen place in Dumbo, but couldn't bear to wait.I saw Em was nearby, and I decided to go there instead. I ordered a beef pho and the wings. The pho really hit the spot. I do think that the portion size is a little bit small but if they added more noodles, it would've been perfect since they had an adequate amount of beef. The soup is super light which is one of the main things I look for in pho. I'm honestly surprised at this place does not have more people. It was pretty empty when I was there. As for the wings they were super saucy, had a lot of spices, fish sauce and garlic. I honestly would've liked it  more if it was a little bit more crispy. But they were some really solid chicken wings.The decor is really modern and is not what you would expect of a pho restaurant. It definitely looks like they serve alcohol, so I wish to try some of their cocktails in the future."

The broth was super flavorful, all of the ingredients were very fresh, and the beef was very tender. The portions are very generous, so I'll definitely be enjoying leftovers for dinner. They have a really interesting menu, and the location is great in dumbo - so I'm excited for my next visit to be in person!"
1942,9I8mZXCkGZBmFh5fYOYorw,9/5/2022,5 star rating,"As a fan of their Bensonhurst location, I was intrigued and wanted to visit Em Vietnamese Bistro in one of my favorite neighborhoods in NY, DUMBO.The interior was beautiful and the color scheme made me feel so royal eating there. On top of that, the food was delicious. The star for me was Ly's Chicken Wings - freshly fried and juicy, sweet with an umami flavor from the garlic butter nuoc mam and a slight kick from the chilis.It was also my first time trying Hu Tieu Kho and it was an experience having the soup on the side of my noodles. Super flavorful broth and the soy sauce egg was sooo good. I also got the Watermelon Cooler which was just a watermelon slush - pretty standard, nothing to rave about.My only complaint which brings this review down to a 4.5 is the Pho Bo here doesn't taste as good as the one I've tried at the Bensonhurst location. The broth wasn't as rich and the beef wasn't as tender. Nevertheless, it was still a solid dish if I hadn't tried their other location first.If you're in the area, I recommend giving Em a shot. I'll definitely be back to try other dishes that are specialties to the DUMBO location."

Sigh!***What we really like is their Stir Fried Udon with beef. My toddler loves it too! All the flavors are concentrated in this dish! It's a truly must order!Their toast with peanut butter and condense milk was soso. I could make it better at home. But for the convenience of eating out, it's ok, but not worth the $1.50 for 2 slices of bread.The pan fried rice noodle is ok.. but pretty much you get the noodles drenched in some bland and watered down sauce. My family and I usually sit on the second floor for lunch, but you can always take it to go if you don't wanna troop up the long staircase. Downstairs, they sell baked goods, pastries, hot and cold drinks, with some seats available. The pastries are not the fluffiest but the price is good for a quick bite.

I'm actually browsing bakeries for Mooncake as a gift; this is one of my stops.  While I am here purchasing a box of the one yolk. I also grab an ice coffee and a Hom Sui Gok to go. The buns didn't look very interesting due to the low lighting of the place and the pastries weren't wide in selection.If my memory serves me right. My box of Lotus with One Yolk cost about $24 and I believe the cost of a Double Yolk cost about $28.I didn't like the $1.20 Hom Sui Gok. It was mushy. I guess I should have asked to heat it up or what I normally do with it when I get it home...toast it up. The ice coffee was okay, what I expected from most average bakeries."

I was going to visit my sister in Somers and this was the ideal time to have a Frankie's. The hot dog was very good. I kept it simple with just ketchup and mustard. The bun was also very good.

Luckily I had a lot of toppings, but it was still not that great...Will pass next time."

It way down the below the main food hall next to Gate 111. They give you a plan dog at $3.25 and charge for the topping at 50 cents or a $1 depending on what it is.  So I asked for a bacon bits and mustard dog and it looked like 1/2 of  bacon bits on it. so I brush some off and it a descent NY frank. So you can do a not so bad hot dog for about $3 to $5 with your mix of toppings or go to Danish Dogs and get a not so great dog for $8 with there toppings, its your money and taste buds.

As a Native New Yorker I should have known not to be the first guy to buy a grilled dog in the morning because what's typically being reheated on the grill is yesterday's leftovers. Since I don't know this for certain I'll review Frankie's as if I didn't know any better.I ordered two hot dogs with my usual choice of condiments of which one is spicy brown mustard. The hot dogs were shriveled, semi-hot and very firm as though they've been on the grill forever. The mustard was watery but the buns were ok. People were friendly. I'll never return since the primary product of why I was there in the first place was horrible. Good job Frankie's! Save a few bucks (I estimate about $2 a$3) but lose a hot dog loving customer that just moved into the neighborhood.There are at least two other hot dog concessions in the food court and around the terminal, you're far better off going to any one of the others."

I have never had a hot dog in NYC and still not good pizza. When I saw the menu had so many hot dog options- Chicago Style was at the top of the list. I visit NYC several times a year but  Chicago only rarely so Chicago dog it was. That hotdog along with a potato cake and some plaintene  chips were my Thanksgiving Meal. Either I was hungry or that was the best hotdog ever. A combination of both. That sucker was messy and I had to scoop the fillings. The hotdog was real beef and yes I can tell the difference. The clerk was pleasant and I have no complaints. Per usual expect to spend some $. I will have my pizza and a hotdog from a street vendor -follow the locals of these days!

Checked in with the staff to confirm whether or not the meat was halal - to which they confirmed yes :)The momos are all delicious, but my personal favorite was the chaat momos - the yogurt, sauces, and momos perfectly complemented each other, and every bite was lovely. I highly recommend getting the chaat momos but all the momos we got were great. Both the chicken and beef versions of each were very good.I didn't really like the chow mein (somewhat bland for me and the beef was tough and rubbery) but this place is all about the momos anyways :P I do want to try their other dishes next time I go though! But the bottom line is if you want specialty momos, this is the spotThe inside of the restaurant is small, but there is ample seating for 2 groups and some individual seating on the left.

I didn't realize their specialties were fusion momos until I got there. They have a lot of fun flavor combos such as chaat, tandoori, and tacos. My friend and I got the jhol, tandoori, and chaat. My favorite was the tandoori, which had a really good grilled and spiced flavors. My friend loved the chaat, which I also thought was really unique, but wasn't number one for me because the momos weren't piping hot. The jhol was interesting because the sauce was lukewarm and didn't do anything to enhance the dish for me, but the momos were hot, juicy, and flavorful.Momo Crave is very casual - you order at the counter and then sit, if you'd like to eat in. Service is pretty fast so it can be a quick meal, especially if you're on a momo crawl through the neighborhood. The unique fusion options are worth a try but don't have me hooked as a go-to momo spot. I do want to get the tacos one when I'm in the neighborhood again next."

We opted to get vegetarian momos for the 2 dishes we got (their tandoori momo and their sandeko momo dishes), and 1 of my friends got their potato chili to share as well.Food came out quickly and man, these were some of the best things I may have ever eaten in my entire lifetime of living in Queens. Whoever had thought of skewering and frying or roasting momos in the seasonings that they used desperately needs a raise. Both the tandoori and sandeko momos were delicious. I'm not sure which I liked more. The potato chili dish was also pretty good, but the momo dishes were where this place really shined. I can't wait to come back here to try out more of their momo dishes.The place also has some cool merch for sale.

The flavors very much remind me of Chinese chilli chicken found in Sagar restaurant or any Desi Chinese restaurant, but of course this time it's beef. The momos are fried but that's ok.Himalayan momo (beef with dipping sauce) - These were good too! It's very similar to the Nepali momos I have at Merit Kabab Palace. The dipping sauce served is similar to their orange/yellow sauce.  The price point was a bit more expensive than Merit Kebab, but maybe that was because I ordered online.

This is definitely a great Banh mi stop in the East Village! They also do a fantastic jobs with big delivery orders as we've ordered from here for lunch at work for 10-15 people!"

1986,DbhBca8LzskjS0B-L4QfZg,2/10/2023,4 star rating,"Tiger Sugar is my third favorite boba spot in the city! It's a worldwide chain with a handful of locations in NYC that has been pretty consistent for me.It does have a lot of hype surrounding it and while I do think it's good, in my personal opinion I don't think it's anything life-changing. But I still enjoy it!My favorite drink is their signature number 1 drink which is brown sugar boba + pearl milk with cream mousse. I've heard some say it's too sweet and others say it's not sweet enough, while some say it's just right. Most of the times I've gone, I've found it to be a tad on the more sweet side, but nothing too sweet that I can't finish it. It's a beautiful looking drink and I love the flavor of the combined brown sugar and cream mousse.Depending on the day and time the line can get long, but I definitely think it's worth trying at least once! They offer a variety of other yummy tea flavors that I think are worth trying too.Hot tip: At the NYC Chinatown location, you can order at kiosks or at the window (can sometimes be a bit longer of a wait). If you're looking to customize it in any way, I'd suggest waiting to speak to someone at the window. I know some locations adjust the sugar level and others don't, so it honestly depends where you go. Same with lactose-free options. It can never hurt to ask!"

Warm brown sugar milk tea  This location is busier, larger and with more variety. 2 people working behind the counter and manage to get through orders fast enough but after a short wait which is perfectly normal and definitely worth it.  Tiger sugar Rockville (MD) should add the additional menu items too. Highly recommended and always the best quality."

1991,DbhBca8LzskjS0B-L4QfZg,11/3/2022,3 star rating,"(Mango Sago: 67.5% | D) - This drink actually tastes quite nice, translating a classic dessert into boba. Unfortunately, there are several technical problems with this drink: first, the toppings make up 50% of the cup, and ice makes up another 25%, leaving only 25% for the actual drink.. the toppings need to be reduced to make room for a better balance; and second, the paper straw here is not designed to be sharp enough to pierce through the plastic of the cup, which seems to be of stronger quality than other places.. furthermore.. the straw has poor suction power and makes consumption of the drink difficult.(Overall: 75% | C) - The actual restaurant itself is spacious and has good decoration, including this massive plush tiger for good photos!"

I am not a fan of boba or pearls so I would always order the Black Sugar Milk with Cream Mousse. But I am now obsessed with their new pudding milk tea it is sooo good! I always open up the top once the milk is gone to make sure I eat all of the pudding leftover, it is that good! My boyfriend always orders the Black Sugar Milk with Cream Mousse, Boba & Pearls! He loves it & is always so happy when I bring it home for him! The last time we went we tried oat milk in one of the teas & I was not a fan of it, it doesn't mix the same as it does with regular milk which leads it to not taste as good. But if you are dairy free it's still a great yummy option! I don't think you'll be disappointed with either of our orders! The shop is so clean & our order is always ready super quick, I've never gone in & there be anyone else inside. I love that they recently added the machines you can see the complete menu & put in your order at."

I'm not a big caffeine consumer and have usually found boba teas to be a little too strong and not sweet enough for my taste but absolutely LOVED my tea here!! The drink is smooth, just sweet enough with plenty of texture coming from the boba and the tiger jelly. The boba is perfectly chewy but I found the jelly to be mostly flavorless. It's also great visually with the 'stripes'. The place has kiosks you order from and then pick up the drink from the counter. For someone that rarely drinks coffee or tea, I honestly really enjoyed my drink and am looking forward to my next time there!"

We walked into Edgar's on Forest Avenue and we were completely ignored by the 2 young woman that were working there. When they did make eye contact they looked completely miserable, with the most unwelcoming look I have ever seen. We were ignored for 7 straight minutes while I stood there with my young daughter in my arms, who was looking forward to her strawberry ice cream. Eventually I got fed up and I said we're out of here. There was no one else in the store! I couldn't believe that we were just ignored like that!

The people at the register completely ignore you as you wait stupidly to be asked if you would like to order. One night, the order was wrong. Another night a friend and I sat for 30 MINUTES until we had to physically walk into the other room and request to order. Finally, the third night, I was stared at while 7 people were behind the counter. Although it's obvious these kids are only there for a check, the manager needs to wake up.

And not one worker looks like they're in a rush to get customers out. This place has gone down hill in years, tonight as I eat melted ice cream, if I ever get out of here, will be my last visit.

The beef stew, roasted chicken, and oxtail are all amazing and highly recommended. They give you plenty of rice to smother all that yummy sauce in. The maduros (sweet plantains) have been consistently harder than we like but maybe that's just what they do. This place is a gem in Richmond Hill/Woodhaven. Definitely check it out!"

We ordered zucchini sticks, and a pizza with half pepperoni and half mushroom. We specified we wanted sautéed mushrooms on the pie and not once, not twice, but the last five times we were given mushrooms that come out of a bucket. We decided for once to call and ask why we were given something we didn't want and were told they were sautéed. I've been making pizza for 20 years and know the difference between sautéed mushrooms and water mushrooms that come out of a bucket. Instead of saying sorry or what can we do to make it right the owner hung up on my mother. When I called back he ""stepped"" out . Not only did they lose loyal customers but now we know how they handle their mistakes"

It lacked any flavor or depth. - the chai muffin was pretty dense and hard to eat. - the music blasting was awful. Think of the worst covers of songs you already kind of hate blasting at full volume.

Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations. It didn't taste very fresh, and was quite firm to the bite. It also wasn't warm. When I bite into a muffin, I like it to be soft, fluffy, and warm.

The jerk chicken is delicious. I dream of the candied yams, creamy Mac n cheese, and the okra. The oxtail is great too!Most importantly, the girls are always SO friendly and helpful.

I appreciated that the greens, turkey wings and candied yams were flavorful but not overbearing. So I would definitely recommend trying the food here. If you are looking for a meal jam packed with flavors and seasoning, you should reconsider eating here. If you want good soul food without the excess oil, then give this place a try. Also, sometimes they gave check-in specials."

The meal came packed well and it was warm. Now onto the food: the Salmon was the best part, then the greens and then the Mac. The mac was just missing something.

No flavor other than the juice from the can of Glory Greens.4. The curry goat was introduced to just enough heat to ensure it was no longer raw; however I chewed on pieces of this curry goat for ten minutes and it would not ""GIVE."" I tried several other pieces of my curry goat and many pieces could not be penetrated with my very sharp human teeth.5. There were only two tables to dine in and virtually no other place to consume your meal.6. I would not recommend The Soul Spot to anyone looking for Jamaican food or Soul food unless you enjoy Glory Greens from a can and curry goat chewing meat that could use no less than 7.5 additional hours of simmering.7. Additionally, I would recommend signs at each display sharing what the sides are; what the proteins are. Some of your items are not readily recognizable."

Since it was raining out we sat for a bit to nibble our meal before braving the subway, during that time more patrons came in and again they were greeted. The star of the meal was the mac & cheese."

In the pouring rain. Before getting dinner.Anyway, yes, we got cupcakes. In comparing this to other bakeries I know - and keeping in mind that this place is definitely in a more expensive area than the others:* Prices are similar but cupcakes are smaller for the price you pay.* There are actually quite a few other types of desserts here. Was thinking about the chocolate chip blondie square and maybe should have rolled that into my order.* Shop itself is standing room only, tiny inside, barely fits 3 customers. You should order ahead and pick up - their customer side is quite limited.So for now, riding on roughly 3-3.5 stars from the atmospheric elements. Time to bite into the cupcakes!* First off, we both finished all 3 of ours. And didn't share. Because they were too tasty to share.* They do have gluten-free cups. And some with artificial frosting color. Some without, as the 3 I ordered were.Apple pie cupcake: Has apples inside, has a nice creamy bit on top, spices within the cake itself. I ended up using 3-4 bites for this one because it was tasty enough not to gulp down in a single shot. Surprised there were a few of these left at the end of the day, since many of the flavors were sold out by the time I got there.S'mores cupcake: Marshmallow instead of frosting makes this a unique choice compared to other places. Chocolate part isn't super chocolatey but it all works together well.Lemon-raspberry meringue cupcake: One I wouldn't normally order, but it's what was left! There was really not much raspberry inside (even compared to their website photo), but the cake overall had a nice lemony tinge to it.Overall, quite honestly, I think the cupcakes need to be 50% larger to really make it. I want to support a local business. And the people inside. And the nice flavors. But in NYC I'm willing to take my wallet out a little more freely if you've really got the right stuff, and I can say I've got the same quality in NJ with larger sizes for the same price. You can do it, Buttercup. You can grow."

Both were some of the best cupcakes I've ever had. Not overwhelmingly sweet and the icing was the cherry on top. The cookies and cream cupcake had an oreo cookie in it which was a nice surprise!Each cupcake is $3.50, and they're pretty small. I would definitely get a couple to share and try different flavors!

Chocolate on chocolate is a win if you're a fan of chocolate (duh!) and the lemon raspberry meringue is lovely if that's your cup of tea.  They have other flavors for those who'd like a variety.  This is a grab-and-go location.  These cupcakes were perfect as a midnight birthday treat when I wasn't wanting to bust out a full blown birthday shabang, but still want to acknowledge a birthday with a sweet treat.  Recommend."

The food itself was very filling as they give a lot of rice and salad. The fish was quite good and flakey. You have the option of getting grilled fish or fried fish but I'd probably recommend fried more given the name of the place.It's honestly so hard to find a solid fast food fish place in Manhattan so I'm glad this place exists!

There was a significantly more bang for your buck. It's enough fried food to split with your girlfriend (please see photo). · You get to choose your fish to fry. Though, just go with the Whittish Fish. It's really good and something the lady said was the best in her opionion. The lady there said she didn't really like the Flounder. Sword Fish are larger fishes and contain high levels of mercury. CONS: · No order that was just fish and chips. You had to get one with shrimps in it. (Though, the fried shrimp pieces were really good.) · Tartar sauce was a bit greenish, which I presume comes from cheap relish mixed into the sauce. It would be a big upgrade if they chopped fresh Dill and Taragon prior to the start of the day. IMPRESSION: · Great spot in FiDi to grab food if you're a tourist and wanting to capture a moment on camera with the Charging Bull statue after (just a few blocks away)."

I'm used to seeing a big, fluffy juicy photo at McDonalds and Burger King, only to get what I can only describe as the cheapest meat available into a Cuban-style pressed ""ham sandwich masquerading around as a thick burger.""

It's no wonder why most negative reviews about this place doesn't mention the food at all, because the food is in fact spectacular!

For my burger, I got a ""make your own burger"" and it was cooked literally perfectly. Sophia was our waitress and she was amazing and the bartender Florence was great as well.

You have to ask for the real hot hot sauce tho. Because they used to give me another hot sauce before a regular told me of this one. If you like perfectly spiced, fall off the bone, absolutely delicious oxtails. If you also like them with magic rice that you can eat buckets of till you explode in delicious  rice goodness, then this is the place to get it from. They do not have any seating.

As meals they each came with rice and beans and some salad. The oxtail was very tasty. The meet was tender, the sauce was good and the portion was quite large. The jerk chicken, on the other hand, was just mediocre. It tasted like it had been sitting in its serving dish for quite some time and did not have the  jerk flavoring kick that most jerk chicken usually does. I also bought some fresh fruit salad and Jamaican fruit punch. The fruit salad was fresh. The prices are pretty reasonable for the portion size. However, jerk chicken is the gold standard by which I compare, and this one missed the mark."

2152,OtY9Dbo6Lmh30Qzt4XyZCA,11/17/2022,4 star rating,"For $3 coffee this spot is more than satisfactory. I needed some caffeine so was looking on Yelp for good spots, and this one caught my eye. We walked over at around 4pm and it wasn't too busy. Everything is one price I believe, and we went with a classic iced latte with a bit of vanilla and oat milk. Usually, this would cost me at least $6 at a regular coffee shop but here it was only around $3! The coffee wasn't super strong, but still had a pretty decent flavor and I loved the oat milk option. I'd come back to try some of their other items for sure."
2153,OtY9Dbo6Lmh30Qzt4XyZCA,12/9/2021,5 star rating,"I cannot believe I've never heard of Matto Espresso before, considering how many locations there are! Everything in the cafe is only $2, be it an oat milk latte or a pistachio muffin. Absolutely perfect in terms of affordability and quality-- Matto serves a really rich dark roast that I find gives a chocolatey roundness to the palate. I ordered their Nitro Cold Brew with oat milk (still $2 with your preference of milk/syrup) and a Croissant Sandwich (with scrambled eggs and a slice of tomato).Their app is also relatively easy to use and you can pay through it to earn rewards. For every $50 you spend, you receive a $5 credit. One of my favorite features on the app is the fact that they will organize all locations by distance from you, which makes it so easy to get delicious coffee at any given moment.There is outdoor seating available at this location, though it is a busy street and occasionally you will find a food truck or two parked next to the seating area. All in all a fantastic chain that I will be returning to soon!"
2154,OtY9Dbo6Lmh30Qzt4XyZCA,4/12/2021,5 star rating,"I love coffee and I also love cheap things, so obviously, I love Matto. Everything on their menu, from drinks to sweets to food is only $2!!! An iced latte? $2! An avocado sandwich? $2! An espresso drink with non-dairy milk? Still also only $2! It's absurd how happy this place makes me. I have tried a few of their drinks and food items/pastries and they always do the trick to caffeinate me and leave me feeling satisfied, all the more so when I remember that each item was only $2. I really enjoy their Red Eye (coffee + espresso shot) and their Iced Lattes are pretty decent for the price! It's honestly a steal that they don't charge anything extra for non-dairy milk alternatives and they're probably one of the only coffee spots in the city that does that. The fact that I can get my regular order of an Iced Almond Milk Latte for only $2 as opposed to the $6 I'd pay at a typical Manhattan cafe just makes me so happy. I also love their avocado egg croissant sandwich; there is a good amount of avocado in it for the measly price! I highly recommend downloading their app to get $5 free, meaning a free drink and food item or even two drinks/pastries! You can order ahead for pick up directly in the app for speed and convenience. I'm a big Matto fan now and I will definitely be back. $2 coffee in Manhattan is a blessing."

Trust me if your nearby you need to definitely stop by!Since we got there around 6pm on a Friday we did have to wait a bit to be able to order. It is only Dine In and it is a small place so be prepared to wait for a seat.I was able to try two different tacos Al Pastor and Longaniza! Both were so delicious but my favorite is the Al Pastor! There is a small serve yourself section for toppings and salsas as well!If your looking for a taco spot in Greenpoint you definitely need to check them out!

My bf and I are huge los tacos fans- there hasn't been a place we've found that's better, but Taqueria Ramirez might be it. Absolutely fantastic. The flavor of the meats, the crunchy exterior of the taco, yet soft- they do a great job at executing the perfect taco shell. Each of the meats were so soft, juicy, so flavorful- I could eat that everyday. We tried the spicy salsa, it had a kick but it wasn't overpowering. I think we got the first 4 on the menu and scarfed it down so fast. All 8.5-9/10. Highly recommend if you love tacos!"
2158,qjCl34rJ0zVUHaZ1irb8FA,4/1/2023,5 star rating,"Outstanding street style tacos. We had the pastor, suadero, and tripa tacos. They have a salsa bar to load up your taco with cilantro, onions, limes, and sauces. There was a line around the corner but it was well organized and moved quickly. All the tacos were great! Super savory and great texture from the spit. Fun spot with good vibes."
2159,qjCl34rJ0zVUHaZ1irb8FA,1/13/2023,3 star rating,"I'll say, the Al pastor taco is worth 5 stars alone. Super tender and flavorful. But I didn't love the suadero. Overall, why am I paying $5 per taco? I felt robbed. Tacos were fine, but that kind of money goes further at tacos el bronco in sunset park, where the portions are larger and the taste is deeper.This place is like the emperors new clothes in terms of hype"
2160,qjCl34rJ0zVUHaZ1irb8FA,1/12/2023,5 star rating,"So everyone is out here saying that this place is the best spot in the city for tacos. I was highly skeptical, especially after conceding that Los Angeles has the best tacos that I've ever had, and that even the Mexican and Latin American neighborhoods in Queens that I grew up in couldn't mirror the quality on the west coast.Boy was I so glad to be wrong. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, these are the best tacos I've ever had in my life each one had the perfect texture, super warm, and just an amazing flavor profile that will blow you away I can't even begin to describe the perfect saltiness crunchiness of the tortilla, but still soft somehow , the savory, deep smokiness of some of the meats - I mean it's just absolutely beautiful.My favorite personally was the Al Pastor, as it usually is at taco joints, and it just had this really nice undertone of sweet, delectable pineapple, highlighting this beautifully rich, salty and flavorful pork. The tripe is also something quite special and it kind of melts in your mouth like butter.However, you honestly just can't go wrong with whatever you got here - each taco blew me away in different ways and I just was in disbelief that a taco could taste like this. Yes they are five dollars a taco and yes they are way more expensive than West Coast tacos but yes, it is so worth it and I do want to come back here How does seating work? you can ask the lady or whoever standing at the door that you would like to sit and she will monitor the tables for you and you should be able to get a spot relatively quickly after your order. The turnaround time is very high. There is no take out, but people generally eat their tacos and then leave.I came around 9 PM on weekday night and there was only a few people ahead of us. We stayed for around 20 minutes."

My friend who lives nearby suggested this spot and told me this is his new go to spot for tacos. Once we entered, we placed our order at the counter. Ended up ordering 3 Al pastor tacos ($5 each) and a bottle of cola ($4). There is a sauce, lime and cilantro station to add to your tacos. The tacos were really good and packed. Was able to eat on the counters which has a view of how the tacos are made. The place is small but not tiny. I am definitely coming back here. - street parking"
2162,qjCl34rJ0zVUHaZ1irb8FA,11/29/2022,5 star rating,"Tacos worth the wait! I haven't been to Mexico but these are surely the best tacos in NYC, and better than Cali (but their prices can't be beat).Simple menu with few taco options. After 2 visits, I would say my favorites are al pastor and suadero. Their longanisa is VERY spicy, even for someone who enjoys spicy ramen on the reg.The wait to order was about 20-30mins then another 20-30mins for our orders to come out. Seating is limited but people are in/out pretty fast so seating frees up often. Highly recommend!! Can't wait to be back"

After some googling and yelping, we found out it was a bomb diggity taco place!The place is small but the turnover is quick. The line is managed by a staff, which makes it orderly and stress free. I appreciate that. We were able to get seats at the counter and saw our food chopped and blow-torched in front of our eyes.  There's plenty of time to think about what you want to order. On this visit, we ordered five different tacos: Al pastor, suadero, longaniza, tripa, and nopales. Once we got our order, we floated over to the salsa bar and added the different salsas, onions, and cilantro to our hearts content. Al pastor was my favorite, as the meat was well seasoned with the perfect sweetness. Tripa comes last as I'm more accustomed to a crunchier version - still very flavorful. On top of this, we got the passion fruit seltzer which calmed the fire in our mouths."

The place was packed...small but what isn't in NYC. Food is delicious, I ordered 1 Nopales + chicharron and 1 pastor. They were SO good, I quickly ordered another pastor. I usually don't go for pineapple in my tacos (unless ceviche) but the thin slice that wasn't super juicy paired perfectly with the meat. I definitely feel Mexico City in the atmosphere, it took me back to the trips I've had."

Walking by you would assume it's a graffiti wall but if you look VERY closely you will see the small ""cheese grille"" sign.. and see a door. The inside is also covered in art work. I feel like they want to be an art gallery or something and the food was a second thought. The person working the counter is super friendly and helpful. The food.. it was a basic grilled cheese sandwich. Nothing special besides the price (my total meal sandwich, fries, and bottle drink was about $17). The bread was decently buttered but the crust was a put hard to get through so I didn't really bother eating it. The cheese had a weird texture almost like gum (like when you've been chewing a piece for too long.. if this makes sense). Fries were perfect if you like shoe string. They were crisp and well salted. I would recommend for a quick bite if you're on the go or if you've had a long night out and didn't want your typical chicken nuggets, this would make a good drunk food stop."

I had the Sweet Potato Tots which was delicious and had just the right amount of crispiness. For the mains I had the Mac & Cheese Garden Melt and the Garden Melt Grilled Cheese. Both were very flavorful and had me so full at the end of the night. I loved the owner Michael. He was very hospitable and made me feel like a regular. He even gave me a couple of shots for free as well. I really could see why people love this spot because not only is the food great, but so was the host. Will definitely be back here soon again."

I shared a Buffalo chicken and the crispy goat with my friend. The crispy goat was amazing. Good textures, creamy, etc. I preferred it to the Buffalo chicken, which was still good. Also this place has Boylan soda, which is my favorite, so extra props to any places that serve it! The Mac and cheese was only okay. The fried Mac and cheese bites were alright. I think the tomato soup added a nice creaminess to it, but it had a flavor/spice my friends did not enjoy. The service staff were accommodating. They had a harsher sense of humor that I found hilarious but I think he may have offended one of my friends. It's CASH ONLY, so if you don't have cash you can order online and have them deliver it to your table. COVID NOTES: They have a large room on the side that has 3 large communal tables at it. And bar stools around the wall counters. It appears all the chairs are still out. We were happily sitting for about an hour when a large group of maybe 15 folks in their early 20s came in and took up 2 of the full communal tables and took masks off to drink. It made me feel rather uncomfortable during COVID so we tried to leave as soon as we could when this happened. Just be careful of your timing and their capacity if you are COVID concerned."

2175,SGkJanKe0-T1C3Fp4SSdYQ,11/16/2005,4 star rating,"This bagel shop could be classified as a diamond in rough. There's not much around it, really. It's pretty much directly under the BQE, there are some car shops, some gas stations, and some bodegas around...but as far as great bagels (and much more) go, this restaurant is the only decent one within a 5 block radius.The Pros: The bagels and cream cheese are just what you'd find anywhere else in New York...great New York bagels that I've become addicted to since moving here...but they also offer a huge selection of gourmet sandwiches (both breakfast and lunch), wraps, salads and soups.They have a huge selection of Boars Head meats and cheeses, and they also have daily specials prepared fresh every morning.And, if you're in the mood to have great food at a party, they also offer catering services.They are open 7 days (til 5 p.m. during the week and til 3 p.m. Sat.-Sun.), and will deliver for free as long as your order is over $10.The Cons: It's not very accessible by subway. The closest one would be the R train to Prospect (and walk4 blocks south) or to 25th Street (and walk 5 blocks north).They've also run out of my favorite bagel on occassion, which really bums me out.

WORST service ever!Not only do these workers have the audacity to give you an attitude let alone dirty looks they will yell at you because they messed up and order bc their ordering system is taken by a degenerate who can't properly write English let alone speak or read it. Not only does a slice of pizza cost more than the norm which would be okay if it was up to par. However receiving a cold slice rite out of an oven.. with  a piece of mozzarella cheese on top and simply asking what is this..? which I have added to the photos so you can see the crap that was put on a plate and served to me. The service here is dispicable and the owners are even more nasty than the help. Save yourself an over priced crappy meal that looks and tastes like trash.

The plantains, empanadas and yucca fries are all very good appetizer options. The vaca frita, ropa vieja and lechon asada are delicious choices and a great option for anyone who is unfamiliar with Cuban food. I will say that the prices are a little high for Cuban food - not surprising when you consider the location.

I also didn't raise the issues with the staff because we really didn't have time for second attempts.My wife had the Lechon Asado, which was good. The yucca that comes with it was an odd preparation. I ordered the Ropa Vieja, a dish I normally love. Their version was mediocre at best, and came to the table room temperature, as if they forgot to heat it up before sending it out. The black beans that came with it were overly salty. We also ordered a side of the fried sweet plantains, which were overcooked and dried out. Portions were very small for the price, but it wasn't like I wanted more of anything.  My wife had flan for dessert, which was closer to packaged vanilla pudding than flan. The espresso was very good.The staff were friendly and helpful, and may have been able to address our concerns if we'd had time to wait for it, but there certainly wasn't much that the kitchen got right on the first try."

The meat was well seasoned and super tender.  My reservation occurred pre-theater matinee time.  The restaurant was crowded when I arrived.  Noise level was a bit high for my liking but considering the amount of customers and the timing it was acceptable.  Serving staff was polite and efficient getting the customers fed and out the door in a reasonable amount of time to get to the theater.  Overall, I would recommend for lunch.  A reservation is required.  Location is good if looking for a bite to eat before a Saturday matinee."

But he suggested we sip in the bar area, at a table. I wish our waiter had been as attentive as he was. We loved the vibe in the bar. But the wait was excessive until I flagged down someone who wasn't our waiter, after all. He then got someone else, who took our order. New waiter.We ordered La Jefe and Havana Spice. Both were delicious. We decided on appetizers due to the time constraints. We ordered Cuban quesadilla and empanadas de pollo. Both were delicious and satisfying . This is a very popular restaurant and I'd love to spend more time here."

Bombay Grill House on 9th ave is up there on my list so far! The biryani is amazing - with the perfect spice level. I only wish they did bone-in chicken biryani but that's okay. I like that they have an $18 deal for take out and delivery orders - you get one entree and one app. The only thing is you have to call the restaurant to order. It doesn't seem like the online ordering options can add this deal without a promo - which I didn't see anywhere.

The space is nice and cozy, with exposed brick wall, beautifully colorful tapestry, as well as cool lighting fixtures. For my drink, I tried the Mango Lassi, which was a generous size. It was perfectly thick and smooth, tasting very refreshing with just the right amount of sweetness.I decided to order the Tandoori Mixed Grill, served on a sizzling cast iron plate, which consisted of salmon, lamb, beef, chicken, onion, and other veggies. This was served with rice, along with peas. I also just had to get the garlic naan. There was only 1 piece of salmon, which I was disappointed about. The salmon was my favorite out of all the meats. It was well seasoned, slightly crispy, wonderfully tender and flaky. I also enjoyed the lamb, which was full of a variety of spices, juicy, and succulent. The beef and chicken were decent as well.The garlic naan was tasty with plenty of garlic flavor. It was also served warm and fluffy.There was a Free Dessert check in offer, so I took advantage of that and had the White Chocolate Rasmalai. This was made out of milk, sugar, pistachio, saffron, and cardamom. It was soft, fragrant, and very sweet. I did like the combination of saffron and cardamom. The addition of pistachio was a welcome one as well. However, I am not sure this is something I would order again.Service was solid. The waiter and staff were welcoming and attentive. Also, the pricing is very reasonable, especially considering the Hell's Kitchen location. I would definitely like to return at some point to try the Shrimp Piri Piri, Lamb Madras, and the Konkan Fish Curry."

We were satisfied with size of entrees and pretty full so we didn't opt for the complimentary dessert. Thanks"

We did some research (a LOT of research) and I'm surprised Bombay doesn't have at least an additional 1/2 star. It's a small place, but the food is outstanding and the staff was really friendly and kind. We shared samosas and kastha khachori. Both savory and delicious. Then we shared chicken tandoori, chicken curry and vegetable jalfrezi. All so good. Loved the slightly sweet almost cinnamon veggies, and the curry had just the right zing. We over ordered by adding naan, but we wanted it to mop up all that amazing sauce. My only regret was not having any room for something sweet at the end. I may have left with a container of leftover naan in my backpack..."

Whimsical, vintage and hip are just a few words I can think to describe it. The theme even extends into the bathroom which was very cool!The food itself was top notch. Curry Puffs on point. Massamam Curry Chicken (my favorite) on point. My sister who was trying Thai food for the first time ordered the Pineapple Rice which she very much enjoyed. And my friends were all very pleased with their respective dishes.Service was awesome and they were very accommodating for our semi large group (of 6). But it's worth noting that this is quite a small restaurant, so larger groups may have a hard time being seated together. If you're looking for a Thai restaurant with a little razzle dazzle- I highly recommend At Nine!"

We were looking for a Thai restaurant closer to the event, but most restaurants were crowded. This restaurant was further away then we wanted but it definitely was worth it. When we arrived, we had to wait a bit for the restaurant to open for dinner. But once the restaurant was opened and we were seated, the place filed up very quickly.Everything we ordered was delicious and I had no complaints. The Lychee martinis were good. Not too strong and tasty. We also had the grilled chicken sate which was just ok to me. But my favorite was the massaman curry. The portion was generous, and the taste reminded me of my visit to Thailand. Most Thai restaurants in NY to me unfortunately don't come close to. I would definitely return again in the future."

Some of us got the lunch special and it was definitely worth the price! For about $15-16, you get a drink, an appetizer, and an entree. We got spring rolls and curry puffs for appetizers. I would pick the curry puffs over the spring rolls. For my meal, I got the shrimp panang curry. It was good, but nothing special about it. They were pretty generous with the protein. I was a bit disappointed that the curry wasn't spicy though. The fried chicken dumplings were a bit dry. On the other hand, I enjoyed the thai iced coffee very much! If your budget is about $20, nothing will go wrong for coming here. But if you want something with a stronger kick, wondee siam in hell's kitchen is the better option."

You can't make a reservation here so My friend and I were joking saying that we would probably get the last table trying to just casually stroll in on a Friday night and that's exactly what happened! We were seated at the very last open table nearest to the bar. I ordered the bartenders special that night . Idk what it was but it had gin in it and it was GREAT! Curry puffs - amazing Panang curry with pineapple fried rice delicious. Service was great! The only issue here is that the table are soo close together you can hear each others heart beat! Don't expect any privacy cuz I was all up in about 3 different tables conversations and I really wasn't trying to be - I felt like I was speed dating and I didn't even have to get up and move. Food is still worth the trip tho.

The interior is fun and inviting, and the servers were all helpful and friendly. We quickly got a table for two, though it definitely got busier as dinner went by so I would recommend reserving a table. We started with the crispy spring rolls, which were fried perfectly and delicious. They were also wrapped thinner than typical spring rolls, making it super fun to eat. We also got lychee margaritas which were sweet and strong. We tried the pad thai that came in a fun bowl, though it was slightly difficult to share across the table. We also ordered the crab fried rice, which came with a decent portion for 1. Overall, the food was wonderful and delicious, and we would come back again! Super glad we stumbled across this restaurant!"

They recommended dishes and were not annoyed when we asked questions. The decor is cute. The food is delicious. The fried chicken started was soooo good and tender but yet crispy. I kept sneaking spoonfuls of the Thai fried rice off my husbands plate that's how delicious it tasted. The spring rolls were very crispy which I loved. Nothing worse than a soggy spring roll. It's affordable as well you def can't beat that.

After the experience we had, I'd even be willing to wait a while for a table next time, if necessary.Service was quick and respectful.Margaritas and cosmos are on their all day happy hour ($9). I got the strawberry margarita and it was delicious AND strong. They don't skimp on the alcohol unlike many other places in Hell's Kitchen.Went the typical route for appetizers and got Chicken Satay (yum) and Fried calamari (also yum).

I was in the area, and I said today is the day. So I stopped in for lunch. So first thing first, I am an aesthetic girl so I am always looking for the cute spots. At Nine is nicely decorated, but super quaint... well SMALL. I was not expecting that at all based off of all the videos I saw. However the vibe is cool, and I would say its perfect for lowkey date nights, and gatherings. Now onto the food, I had the fried chicken dumplings for my appetizer, and for my entree I had the Pad See Eiw. The fried chicken dumplings were not what I imagined but they were good nonetheless. I would definitely get them again. In my opinion it is more like a fried chicken bite, and not really a dumpling. But what do I know ? As for the Pad See Eiw, it was so flavorful! The noodles were coated nicely with the sauce and were cooked perfectly. I wish there was more American broccoli and less Chinese broccoli because I am not a huge fan of all the stems.  The chicken was tender and flavorful, and not just a ""topping to the dish"". Drumroll, please... the star of the experience was the drink! Anytime I can get a Lychee Martini I am going to get one. My preference is to add a little coconut creme, but that wasn't an option. However, this martini was so good on its own. Let me tell you it was strong but smooth... like you know you're going to be lit but it goes down real easy. Let's just say I would definitely come back for the drinks. Oh, and I can't forget if you were second guessing coming here they have all day happy hour for $9! You can't beat that! All in all, At Nine didn't miss. The food was great and the drinks even better!"

This was a let down as I'd expected it to be hot.The crêpe had no flavor so I just picked out the bits of chocolate and strawberry. The chocolate was basically chocolate pieces that they stuck in? It looked like a piece hadn't melted fully.The price point was $8 for a milk chocolate crêpe plus $2 for strawberries-- so for $10.89- I definitely expected more."

Since there are no other crepe places close to me, I have no choice but to visit Bonjour Crepes & Wine. I used to enjoy it, but everything is outrageously expensive. The crepe itself is $9 and additional toppings (like strawberries) are $2 extra. They barely put any Nutella on the crepe, so I pay another $2 for extra nutellla. Therefore my total is $13 (not including tax). Although the crepes here are delicious, don't come here if I want a cheap dessert!"

When we asked questions about the content of the food for dietary restriction reasons all he did was point back up at the menu without even looking at us again, which was not helpful. Then at the end of the night instead of coming over and telling us he was closing, he just shut the lights out on us and didn't say a word. This was 40 minutes before closing time too. Also, for a place called crepes and wine I found it odd they had no wine (or any alcoholic drink at all). Or maybe he was lying and just didn't want to do the work to break out a new bottle or something. (I remember the date and time, it was recent) so if the owner has any interest in who this employee was feel free to reach out)"

It's never too crowded, and there are plenty of tables inside and outside. I only ever get the gruyere crepe (no ham). I'm a bit of a purist/snob when it comes to crepes, so I only trust the gruyere crepe if I'm not in France. It's basically just like grilled cheese but crepe form, so you can't go wrong.The crepes here aren't anything to write home about, especially if you've had the real deal in France, you'll know this is the American version. But I have always been able to satisfy my crepe craving by coming here.Another reason I have a soft spot for this place - they play soccer games on the TV!"

The avocado salad was just okay, I'd get the whole chicken ($18) next time and then add on some other sides. The chicken was so tender and juicy.

They were perfectly fried and delightfully crispy.For my entree, I ordered the Tacu Tacu, which consisted of filet mignon strips, Peruvian style rice and beans risotto, as well as a fried egg. I really enjoyed this dish! The filet mignon sautéed with onion and red peppers were tender, juicy, and wonderfully well seasoned. The rice and beans were yummy together, but I wouldn't call it risotto, because there was no cheese. The savory sauce was quite flavorful. The egg was a nice addition to the plate. All the ingredients worked well together. Service was great and our waitress was friendly.

The place was very busy at this time with mostly all tables filled up. I truly loved the ambiance from the start! They have dimmer lights but with these blue neon lightbulbs that just give the atmosphere a very trendy and lively touch. They play Hispanic music at a reasonable volume on the background which also adds to the energy of this place. We had our very kind server come get our drink and food orders and gave us crunchy corn with two different sauces on the house while we waited. We got two pisco sours, one was classic and the other one was a maracuyá, or passion fruit, which were both foamy and flavorful without being too sweet. For food we ordered: Ceviche de Corvina: very good portion of fish with crunchy corn, plantain chips, boiled corn, and sweet potato. The leche de tigre was very lemony and not too salty which was perfect. The fish itself did not have the best texture for ceviche but it was overall okay. I've definitely had better ceviche in other places so I am not sure I would order this again. Lomo Saltado: amazing! The steak was tender, juicy, and full of flavor without being too salty or heavy on the soy sauce. It came with a generous amount of sautéed onions and tomatoes that made this dish so good. The white rice and fries were also very well prepared. I'm pretty critical about lomo saltado but this was a very solid one in terms of flavor, textures, and portion size. Camarones Inka: also loved this dish. Came with shrimp in a delicious creamy aji Amarillo sauce that felt rich and comforting. Comes with a bed of rice with what I think had saffron which also was amazing. Perfectly cooked! I usually never eat all the rice my dishes come with but here I just could not help it. Would recommend to shrimp lovers.Alfajores: three little alfajores with some whipped cream. Pretty sweet but portion is small enough that it felt like a good amount of sweetness when sharing. Really liked the presentation and the crumbly and crispy texture alfajor biscuit itself. Really loved this place! Their main dishes all smelled/ looked delicious and we loved the ones we tried. Service was also outstanding. At some point, they politely asked us if they could change us to a smaller table since they had originally seated two of us in a large booth but there was another large group waiting and they gave us pisco shots on the house to thank us for agreeing which was very kind. The ambiance is also really fun and I loved how you don't need to make a reservation in advance if you have a smaller party. Will definitely be coming back and I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for good Peruvian food in the area."

Either have the printed voucher or even easier, the QR code screenshot onto your phone. Easy peasy. The hostess was very nice. While the full party hasn't arrived she let me sit and wait anyway probably because it wasn't at peak brunch hour yet. Nonetheless much appreciated. The space is cozy and nice. I love the ambiance in the daylight and surely night time as well.Now, the deal states 60 minutes unlimited drinks based off the brunch menu offering. However, you can only select one choice the entire time for unlimited. So if you have 2 people in your party, it would be wise to just order two different types of drinks so you can just go back and forth with that without hassle. Larger parties, then you might be able to try all of them.The frozen margaritas were on point and the mimosas are you know mimosas. Lol.The food. Peruvians are known for their lomitas so of course that is what to order. Flavors are amazing and presentation was top notch even for brunch. The hanger steak was equally good but less of a presentation more of a standard brunch item. The desserts, Peruvian ice cream tasted a lot like Thai Iced Tea which I loved and the Peruvian Chocolate Cake was quite rich. Excellent offerings.I really enjoyed the brunch here and I can't wait to revisit to try their dinner offerings + ambiance.FAN."

It was well seasoned, the fish tasted really fresh, very cirtrusy (I like citrus but I don't like the word citrusy, sounds like a Gen Z euphemism).They did have these little corn(?) crunch things on the table that did not amuse me but were good during the wait.

I tried their ceviche mixto and not only did it lack in quantity but in quality of flavor.  If there ever was a frozen dinner Peruvian ceviche, this is how it would taste. It's not terrible to the palate, but too simple and not true to the cuisine. The shrimp was precooked but not my lime. Cocktail shrimp were added to a cold lemon soup. They dashed it with some calamari and I may have tasted some fish in there. I'm not sure... as it was a small serving. I may have inhaled it all in a few deep breaths without knowing after some long and very somber sighs. I ordered a Lomo Saltado but it never came. Amazon could have delivered it to me already. I felt terrible but I had to cancel the order after about 45 minutes after it was placed. Even though I sat in a party of 1 (me), I noticed that other tables next to me were being served 4 or more plates at a time. And while the music was lively and playing loud, I heard my inner sad violin playing more boldly. While I was canceling, behind me I heard in Spanish ""no se lo habia hecho"" [the cook had not done it].  So the bossman seemed satisfied in agreeing not to charge me for the Lomo. So I thought win, win? No, we both lost, unfortunately.  Maybe it was a bad day or maybe it was not a good restaurant. I'll leave that up to you to decide. For me, this review is for this day because we both lost and I give myself 1 star as well. But I can't wait to find a restaurant worthy of my 5 stars soon and I'm not difficult, I just don't eat in too many new places. Being adventurous takes much curiosity, courage, and being fearless of risks and losses with a focus on discovering a satisfying treasure. I did not discover it this day but I hope you will when you search for it here. Ciao adventurers."

We were seated right away, and within a few minutes a server came over to take our order. We were definitely not ready at the time, but after we said we needed a bit to decide, it felt like she came back again really soon. So good service but almost ""too"" good that we felt very rushed to pick something. Anyway, after making our decisions we ended up splitting a few dishes and getting the Pisco sour drinks:Kausa Limena - super pretty, but I didn't love the texture/flavor as much as the other dishes Ceviche Aguacate - yummy and citrus-y! Definitely my favorite from the night and all the elements from the plantain to the avocado added great flavor Tiradito Exotico - the sauce was tangy and the fish was tasty too in this dish! Passion fruit pisco sour - this drink was super tasty, fruity, and also definitely nice and sour!Overall, the food was tasty (though I wasn't a huge fan of the kausa we ordered). The portions were slightly smaller than we expected, and the service was alright but we felt a bit rushed/pressured to decide and move through the meal despite there still being several open tables on a weekday evening. The music was also pretty loud, so even on a table of 3 it was occasionally difficult to hear the conversation. I would give this place a 4/5 for their food but a 3/5 for the overall experience!"

For drinks, we tried the traditional pisco sour and pisco sour maracuya. If this is your first time having a pisco sour, order the traditional one.Lomo saltado was tender and juicy. You can't go wrong with that!The ceviche was flavorful and fresh. The list of ceviche choices was extensive, so ask your waiter for the recommendation.The only thing that was slightly disappointing was the tres leches - it was covered in whipped cream, which overpowered the taste of the cake."

The manager there is always friendly and helpful and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a casual sushi experience under $80s. In addition to the Omakase, they also have several special ""fancy sushi"" that you could add on. My favorite of all time is the Bug Mac with Uni, Wagyu and fish!"

It's only a block or two from my place so I'm shocked I'd never been before - it was delicious! This compact spot, which does super fresh sushi, expanded from its original omakase-only menu (started at the alfresco location in the Bowery Market) to include a la carte sushi and roll combos. The indoor location on West 10th Street is where we went.I got the sashimi plate (12 pieces), which was amazing, along with a green tea. My boyfriend got the spicy tuna maki and king salmon maki. Each of the specialty maki's come cut into 8 pieces. You must know that the music is so on point, and many come here for the affordable omakase. They certainly bring the best of the traditional Japanese experience for the New York market."

I have celiac disease, and the staff were able to provide recommendations on gluten free modifications for almost every dish.

Nice, quiet atmosphere."
2250,IS94JDTcq_WedBcj6P4qpQ,10/10/2022,3 star rating,"While Sushi on Jones has reasonable pricing, I would say my omakase experience here was just alright.They offer two different omakase versions, a 12 course and a 20 course. I opted for their 12 course omakase which was $68. Each piece had a good fish-to-rice ratio, and my favorites were the wagyu with truffle and scallop. The overall quality though didn't wow me and some of the sauces didn't feel necessary. The ikura also wasn't good, not sure which kind they use but it tasted off to me.I did feel the experience was a little rushed (I was in and out within 40 minutes) and wished I had more time to fully enjoy the experience. The waiters and chef were super friendly though and I even got a free shot of sake at the end which was super nice!3/5, +.5 for great service"

Thought I'd go to this location for late lunch.I've been to the original location years ago when Brooklyn Beckham would go there with his parents. I had a great omakase there.Unfortunately I won't be coming backThe ikura .. he would say ""caviar"" from Alaska was not good. I rather have another piece of fish.  There was a really crappy mayo baby shrimp that I regret eating. 2 tuna sushi pieces served were also heavily glazed with an overly sweet soy. I think most traditional sushi chefs wouldn't approve. It overpowered the fish.I'm used to finely chopped tuna with green onion that ends the meal. I had heavily soy rice with Shiso leaves and strips of tuna? Usually they give it to me half rolled and not in a cone. I couldn't finish it, tuna itself was fine but together it was meh.The scallop, uni, caviar was good. Overall I think I enjoyed 2/3 of the 20 pieces omakase. Servers were nice. They had a bit of a side discussion unhappy with each other about a work incident that could have been talked about elsewhere. They were always nice in front of clients though. When the server handed me the bill and noticed I didn't finish the hand roll, he asked how my meal was. I told him I was disappointed. I gave my credit card and he insisted he'd give me a discount and apologized for the roll.Honestly I might have been unlucky. It was 1 chef behind the counter but he was overwhelmed with take out orders at the end and I wondered if he just rushed my order thinking I have no standards."

I don't usually post negative reviews, but I have to in this case, for the sake of others, if the same host/manager/waiter is still working there.We had a terrible experience with the host/manager/waiter of this restaurant (4/15/21, 7-8pm). Not sure of his title, but he was the only one there, besides the sushi chef(s). We had reserved for Omakase and were seated outside. During covid-19, this is understandable, but prior notice would have been nice. It was raining, windy, and cold.He made a very disturbing blatant antisemitic comment. I'm European and not a sensitive person in any way, and this was not some gray area/potentially misunderstand-able comment. Upon asking for the ""kosher Omakase selection"" and explaining that kosher killing of animals partially involves minimizing the suffering of the animal, he said that it's ironic, because we Jews have been killing all sorts of people for a very long time. Word of advice; you can have any political opinion you want, but it's just unintelligent to voice it to the people tipping/reviewing you.He turned off the outdoor heater during our second plate. When asked about it, he claimed that it just failed on them.He wanted to swipe our credit cards before showing us the bill. It quickly became clear why. He charged us for 2 pots of tea even though we ordered 1. He claimed they charge per cup, even though the menu clearly says $7 per pot. Fraudulent.Never again."

There was salad, penne a la vodka, some pasta with garlic and broccoli, eggplant rollatini, and two types of chicken. Food was fine, standard for any Italian place. The restaurant itself is half pizza place, half sit down restaurant. For a Saturday evening, they were packed by 6pm as we were heading out. Overall a nice, casual neighborhood spot."

You can taste how fresh the ingredients are, and I love that you can get a personal size (and it has a cute heart shape). The fried calzone is also good. I will say that while the wings are great and comes with a tasty sauce, they have gotten unreasonably expensive. I've watched the price climb from $8.99 to $14 to now $20. For 6 wings? No thanks! The service is awesome. I ordered a pizza and was given an arrival estimation between 7:35 and 7:45. The pizza arrived far earlier than the projected timeframe and piping hot. Will definitely order from here again."

I normally order the 6 slice pies or the square pies but this time it was just the two of us I ordered individual slices and garlic knots. I'm not sure if they had the slices sitting out but I had two different sizes and textures of 2 plain slices. The garlic knots had no garlic in it.  The bread tasted stale and just reheated with some dried parsley and Parmesan cheese sprinkled on them. I guess I have to go back to ordering a whole pie or slices somewhere else and no more garlic knots.

The venue was intimidate, ambience was sophisticated, and the food was what'd you expect from a jazz club - not great but also not bad!We saw Eric Comstock (piano&voice), Sean Smith(bass), and special guest singer Barbara Fasano. The music felt like a love story to manhattan and but also self discovery, with a hint of old New York in the commentary and lyrics. Eric was great with the vocal but also very interesting commentaries in between. The show had a great flow and captivated us for the entire 1.5 hours.There is a ticket to get into the venue, $40pp, and a $20pp food/drink minimum. We thought the price was worth for the night as it was a truly unique. We ordered an impossible burger, fried calamari, and artichoke dip. The calamari surprised me because it was pretty good, tender on the inside and crispy on the out. They also had one sauce for the calamari that was delicious!

The popcorn shrimp was okay, nothing to rave about. I thought the fruit and cheese platter paired really well with the wine and the crackers in it were tasty.

Here's what I wish I knew before I went:(1) You can purchase tickets online, and save yourself the wait or being sold a more expensive table at the door(2) Even if you buy a ticket, I still recommend getting into line early because all seating is first come first serve. We were one of the last bar seating folks to arrive and your view may be blocked by the bar(3) The area is not the best, so some crazies might be on the street(4) Theres a $20 min spend per ticket so you can get a food, drink or both. Food is not amazing, but your definitely there for the music(5) They have to go boxes if you don't finish the food(6) the show is a little under an hour!The staff is attentive and the music is enjoyable.

My tip would be to just get drinks there, as I thought the food, even the appetizers, were mediocre. Wait to eat somewhere fine later!But the wonderful music and fun vibe of Birdland deserve a five, IMHO. The band leader plays the sax. He helps you to know all the talents on the stage after they all have featured solos within the various songs. Three of the younger band members were his students at SUNY Purchase. The young trumpeter was unbelievably talented. Great piano, bass, drums, horns. A really fun outing #1 for our group who live around the country."

It turned out that I didn't plan enough ahead and ended up with one option: Birdland at 10:30.Tickets were 40 Dollars plus a 20-dollar minimum for food or drink. I suggest calling ahead as they were sold out even a half hour before the start of the set. I originally reserved 2 tickets but had no problem changing to 1. It is first come first serve for tables so plan on arriving 30 minutes early as the line gets long.I saw the Delfeayo Marsalis Uptown Jazz Orchestra and I was glad I did! the band was wonderful and I even got to talk to the musicians afterward! This was definitely the highlight of the evening.As for the food, it was mediocre. I ordered a burger and a slice of pie. I was so engulfed by the music I didn't take any pictures of the food.

I also liked rhe lamb chops as they were slightly crisped and did not taste gamey at all. The beef ribs were great and it's sauce was on the sweeter side compared to an American cuisine. The snow crabs were also fresh and meaty. However they didnt provide the crab crwcking tool. The coconut dessert were complimentary and had jelly texture.

The food was a lot better probably because we had the more expensive option which included king crab.

Ugh!  No luck.  So we ended getting Geoduck and had that sautéed in veggies & crispy tofu.  Jumbo shrimp with walnuts, salt & pepper pork chop, braised short ribs, clams in black bean sauce, stir fry veggies and a crab & fish maw soup! We enjoyed everything but then we saw a bunch of deliveries on snow crab.  What?!! And then we wish we had ordered the snow crab! lol guess it's on for next time! #yelplife#traditionaldining#cantonesefood"

Some of my favorites include the roasted pork bun with the white crackling topping and steamed leaking duck yolk buns. My mom likes the baked version of the leaking yolk buns but that debate can be endless. As I'm writing this - I am starting to have intense cravings again for dim sum

They have a sit down area for a nice breakfast/lunch or you can order to go which also works. There are different types of foods for everyone. I enjoyed the coffee and the croissant I bought.

Ahhh - I don't know what to do when ppl are nice. You half expect attitude. I went to the bathroom after I ordered the latte and came back to order a croissant but it was already a bag+ a mini chocolate muffin with the coffee. Maybe it was a slow morning (Tuesday) or something in the air but thank you! Will definitely support this location.

It's not the best shashouka I've had, as it could have been more flavorful. I also got a latte ($7), which they made with simple syrup.For the table, we shared a Margherita pizza ($22) and fries ($11). The pizza was really good and I loved the Asiago crust. The fries were thin and crispy. For some reason, they gave us a complimentary side salad and egg/bacon breakfast sandwich, which came on a biscuit. The sandwich was super yummy!Service was great! Our waiters constantly filled our water and I felt like they still gave us attention even though we were seated outside. I wish we sat inside because it is very pretty and vibey!"
2345,xkvv0n7jbl4Ra3Vm_jfxaA,3/3/2023,2 star rating,"Home of Obama's Favorite Burger, Upland Has Lost Its EdgeWhen Upland first opened in 2014, it was what New York City needed--a bright, airy, high-ceiling restaurant that could absorb the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. And on top of that, serve delicious Californian fare that reminds us to incorporate more of that west coast ethos into our lives. That ethos tells us fresh is always best and everything is better with avocado.Once home to President Obama's favorite burger, Upland has since become complacent. In many dimensions, it is good. But in many dimensions, it falls marginally--but painfully--short of being great.The tuna crudo was served with serrano peppers, avocado, cucumber, and a healthy topping of seaweed. The textural nuances were right, but the dish ultimately lacked depth. The fattiness and density of the tuna and avocado desperately needed a dose of acidity to cut through. A healthy squeeze of lime would have elevated this dish immensely.If only the tuna crudo could have borrowed from the flavor bomb that was the burrata. Served with marinated leeks and pickled shallots, the dish was almost trying to do too much. Burrata has the power to stand firmly on its own. Its milky, buttery flavor is delicate yet deceptively addictive. Upland's enhancements took away the charming subtlety that burrata lovers crave and ultimately detracted.The pappardelle was cooked well. The broad pasta was elevated by a spicy sausage ragu with kale. The kale was undoubtedly the star of this dish. Its sweet and slightly bitter notes balanced the richness that one looks for in a good sausage ragu. While this ragu delivered on that dimension, it needed zing. Perhaps a little extra garlic or a zesty tomato paste would have done the trick.The desserts were the most disappointing part of the meal. The chocolate budino was covered with a thick layer of what tasted like $5, grocery-store raspberry jam. (Perhaps that's being unfair to $5, grocery-store raspberry jam.) Unfortunately, the jam dominated what should have been a light, yet decadent, dish. Upland's interpretation left a lot to be desired.The apple pie sundae was better, but only because it was mostly just a scoop of vanilla ice cream--and who doesn't love that? The almond granola was fine but a far cry from excellent. One doesn't come to Upland expecting the granola to taste like Eleven Madison Park's claim to fame (EMP's hefty price tag is worth it just for this jar of granola at the end, but we'll leave that discussion for another day), but it also shouldn't taste like it came out of a bag from my pantry. The most underwhelming part was the caramelized apple at the bottom, which would have benefitted from a large sprinkle of cinnamon during the cooking process.When Upland first opened, I loved it. As I've returned over the last few years, I've wanted to love it. But Upland is a good reminder that if we fail to strive for continuous improvement, we ultimately become subpar. Would I go to Upland again? Yes. Would I ever passionately recommend Upland to a friend who asks? No. And that lack of passion pretty much sums up the food at Upland."

Decor is stylish, upscale, and chic, as you would expect from Starr restaurants (owner of Buddakan, Electric Lemon, Pastis, etc.) Even at the bar, service was friendly and attentive. The salmon benedict was well-executed with a generous portion of smoked salmon, nothing remarkable though.

I picked this spot for dinner after spending the day surprising one of our girl friends with a baby shower (her husband was in on the surprise and it was super successful!). The service was attentive and prompt without being overly hoveringThe food was delicious. Decent serving size and apps were shareable (we were a part of 6). I really enjoyed my Pappardelle and had it with a glass of chardonnay. Not sure if that was the correct pairing, but since I'm not a huge fan of red wine, it was what I wanted even though I ordered a meaty red sauce item. I was mostly finished with my wine prior to dinner anyway, so it worked out. I would definitely come back for dinner, it looks like it would be a good spot for an intimate dinner date as well."

One bummer was that I asked for dressing on the side but they mixed it into the salad and was very dressing heavy. Also it was just a lot of cheese, walnuts avocado and cucumber slices. Thank goodness I ordered the chicken or there wouldn't have been much substance. The waiter was good about refilling our drinks, and the food was quick."

As I was approaching the Bryant Park train station, I saw a former vet who was down on their luck. I reached for my wallet- failing to realize I didn't have any change to give him. I explained not having change, but offered my breakfast sandwich. He was extremely appreciative of the gesture.Often we leave feedback about our experiences with establishments. Rarely ever do you see reviews about those who have helped others. I'd love to see this become more of a trend. Thanks to Chick-fil-A, a former vet was able to have a breakfast he wasn't expecting. Thanks to me, his faith in humanity was restored.  Sharing is caring and the world can use more of it!"

No movement 9:22pm store doesn't answer my call, my wife calls and store answers right away (they see your incoming call is associated with the phone on the order and avoid answering)9:37pm order finally arrived, tracking finally worked when they were 3 minutes away.Extra love for the fact my order receipt shows 9:02pm order placement. Needles to say, skip delivery, and certainly skip delivery milkshakes.See the video for a container of large fries that arrived half full, A+ effort here to justify the $5 delivery fee on top of tip."

2358,pgdSnnYfqfpwQFjVpbK6Lw,7/12/2021,4 star rating,Chick-fil-A is overrated as far as I'm concerned. I tried to enjoy the chicken sandwich but when I read the ingredients I was not happy. I did pass this location and saw it was new. I was hungry and the chicken sandwich filled my stomach. I like the drill when you go in to order. The employees are very nice. I'm giving them four stars because it's nothing I can put my finger on that turns me off. I'm sure I'm eating all kinds of additives and preservatives in all my food! I still think this chicken sandwich is overrated but I love their breakfast food and the coffee is decent too!

They had quick line to order (one queue and then a lot of cashiers) - it'd almost be faster/easier to give numbers than try to put names, though. Calling them out in a busy pick-up area doesn't work well.The upstairs is seating, and crowded at that, so you share tables and you can get refills of your soda (but not tea?). Table was sticky - they need to come around to clean up more frequently as between people taking over tables is very short time (given the crowded nature).Overall, been to better Chick-fil-A locations. The chicken sandwich and fries were the same (fries a little on the salty side actually)."

They have plexiglass around the registers and social distancing markers on the floor, and the food came out much faster than I was expecting. Quality was about the same as always, but I was impressed by the speed (considering recent visits to other locations)."

It's pricey, but worth it in my opinion. Everything was spectacular, and the service immaculate. The uni in particular was the stand-out dish for me, and my partner really enjoyed the steak. We got the mixed-drink and wine pairings, and phewww we were looking a little flushed by the end. Don't underestimate the small cups! Whenever we try other Michelins now we always think it's good, but not Tsukimi! That's the only con I can think of for having such delicious food and creating such a memorable experience."

2366,f48yzy50jQDH7X5xFAluOw,3/31/2023,5 star rating,Came here to celebrate my mother's 69th birthday and this place did not disappoint. I was amazed by the style of dishes and the unique pairings and flavors and deduced to give it a try. The place itself is very quaint and discreet from the outside. they serve you in the middle with bar like tables facing each other and mirrors on opposite ends. the staff did an amazing job of describing how to eat each dish and what each dish was. the entire meal took about 1.5 to 2 hours and my mom really enjoyed it. highly recommend coming here for a special occasion or if you just want to treat yourself!
2367,f48yzy50jQDH7X5xFAluOw,11/18/2022,4 star rating,"Sigh. I was really hoping Tsukimi would be NYC's answer to Narisawa--or at least the now defunct Sugiyama (RIP, oh great one)--but it wasn't quite there. Still, it's probably the best kaiseki/modern kaiseki NYC has to offer as it continues to be distracted by the overhyped omakase-style dining experience.What we got:Small bites: - Wagyu, unagi, egg: Lovely- Kanpachi, nori, yuzu kosho: Classic Japanese flavors- Bluefin tuna, truffle: A bit unimaginative for such a prestigious fish, plus the truffle was rather flavorless- Nodoguro, kabu, sudachi: Very tasty- Uni, kaluga caviar, egg, potato, rice: So much goodness in one dish- Duck, shishito: Surprisingly well done duck- Ezo awabi, daikon: Creative- Kinmedai, fennel, yuzu: My favorite dish of the night, but it should've been served with a spoon so that diners could really sop up the sauce- Wagyu, rice, egg yolk: Hearty- Concord grape, rose: Dessert #1. Fine - Corn, soy sauce, butter, popcorn: Dessert #1. Amazing. Truly. A brilliant way to harness the flavor of sweet corn in that classic, Japanese, ""not too sweet"" deliciousness way- Chestnut, fig: Dessert #3. I've been hoping to find a gelatin wagashi of the likes I had a at Sugiyama, and while this wasn't as interesting, it was a good effortFinal thoughts: While service was perfect, I did not like the layout of the restaurant. You essentially sit on two opposing counters facing other guests with nothing in between you but space for staff to move around. The kitchen is at one end of the counters, so you don't have a great view unless you're sitting closer to that end. I really hated making awkward eye contact with the diners across from me--it felt like every subway ride where you're trying not to look at the person seated across from you in case they're crazy."
2368,f48yzy50jQDH7X5xFAluOw,10/20/2022,5 star rating,"One of the best meals I've had in the city. I liked Tsukimi more than Chef's Table Brooklyn Fare and Le Bernardin. My humble opinion is that the style of food here is what Chef Ramirez aspired to make. Or maybe the other way around; Tsukimi improved upon Brooklyn Fare.It's a 12 course meal. Amuse Bouche +8 savory courses + 3 small dessert courses.Having a larger number of courses with smaller portions per course means each course is packed with depth of flavor. We were satisfied with every single course. There was a lot of variety that flexed the full breadth of what Japanese Kaiseki cuisine has to offer.The chef is also a genius of plating. The dishes had some of the most elegant design I've ever seen. Another restaurant I think that is comparable in this department is Core by Clare Smyth, a 3 Michelin star restaurant in London. So Tsukimi is punching above its weight class.We had:- Amuse bouche: 3 bites of truffle tamago egg + unagi + wagyu- Beautifully plated madai sushi piece with little flowers sprouting from the top- Bluefin tuna with truffle- This king crab type of soup that was perfect for the cold weather- Extravagant noodle bowl ('somen') with Hokkaido uni and caviar- A wonderfully flavorful dry aged duck breast- Miyazaki Wagyu with rice- few other savory fish courses- The main dessert was incredible. I don't know how to describe it. It was this puffy cloud thing that was firm but disintegrated in your mouth. Light and deliciousThe duck course was the best cooked duck I've ever had. The second best duck I've had was at Gabriel Kreuther.Incredible meal and I will be back. Service was also stellar - friendly and homey. If there's one ding I can give - I'm not the biggest fan of the lighting and decor. Tsukimi refers to the moon viewing holiday in Japanese culture so there are moon-related motifs in the restaurant. So maybe the lighting was for emulating moonlight. I think it could be a bit cozier with more glow lighting but that's just my humble opinion."
2369,f48yzy50jQDH7X5xFAluOw,7/21/2022,5 star rating,"I actually found out this place had a Mich star after I ate there. But it's not even remotely surprising. I think the most surprising part was the negative correlation between how unbelievable the food was and how snobby the staff was. They were extremely professional, but very sweet and caring. It just showed how much passion the entire place puts into every part of the experience. The food speaks for itself. You'll have to pay a premium, but if I had to sit down and think about it... probably the best meal I have ever had"

The dishes had a great variety and had slight fusion creations. All servers were attentive, polite and shared with us great details on each course. Taste wise, we indeed enjoyed all of the dishes. My bf received Happy Birthday and it was quite funny to see how many people in the room were also celebrating their b-days. Pleasant experience - will def come back again."
2371,f48yzy50jQDH7X5xFAluOw,6/3/2022,5 star rating,"Wow. What an experience. Usually, I don't find these high priced fine dining experiences worth it and am more often disappointed with such places. However, Tsukimi easily ranks as one of the top two meals I've ever had. Ever. We reserved one month in advance. When we entered the room, we were seated and our coats were hung up. I enjoyed every dish with the highlights bring the A5 Wagyu and the egg on egg in egg. We felt full and definitely had to make quite the effort to finish the desserts. I wasn't as big on the desserts but I really enjoyed the Granny Smith apple shaved ice. At the end of the night, we went home with the menus of what we had enjoyed over the course of the evening. This is an intimate and elevated experience with seatings of only 12 people at a time. The service was topnotch. Super attentive and polite. I dropped a couple of things on accident and they are so on top of it, they already picked it up before I even could locate the item I dropped. The bathroom was amazing, just go. Odd to say but this was my favorite bathroom at a restaurant ever."
2372,f48yzy50jQDH7X5xFAluOw,10/4/2022,5 star rating,"I came here last week for dinner with two friends. We had a  good time, and it was one of my friend's first time dining at a Michelin star restaurant. Reservations was not too hard to get, I think we booked one week in advance for a Wednesday 8pm spot. It is notable that they only do two seatings each day: 5pm and 8pm.Tsukimi is a very unique kaiseki experience that is elegant in its taste as well as its presentation. It is a 12 course meal that takes about 2-2.5 hours. They incorporate high quality expensive types of fish that is native to Japan into their dishes. The setup is an intimate 12 seats around the center island. All the courses are served at the same time, so it is imperative you are not late. There are servers around the restaurant that help assist you if you need any help with anything, and to give you undivided service.I am unsure on how frequently their menu changes. But we had their Fall Menu. All the dishes we had are included in the picture I uploaded. I enjoyed every single course. Rather than talking about the whole 12 courses; I will only mention the highlights just so I can save the experience for yourself. Highlights:- Madai, Heimloom Tomato, Finger Lime, Okra: Madai (or Sea Bream) was fresh and delicious and the accompanied citrusy profile made it a refreshing course. I love the incorporation of okra in this dish. This was as an aesthetic pleasing dish as it was to taste.- Nodoguro, Lotus Root, Sudachi: Nodoguro (blackthroat seaperch) is a very tender and flavorful fish, it is accompanied with a citrus slice and lotus root based soup. The soup is very hearty and is refreshing to the palate. Perfect dish to have with the recent drop in temperature. - Somen. Kaluga Caviar, Ezo Awabi. Uni. Tomato: This is an interesting combination of two very expensive components: Uni and Caviar. Usually I don't like the idea of them together since they both have very strong distinct flavors and would overlap. But oddly enough it worked okay. Of course. do try caviar and uni on it's own before you decide to mix the whole thing. Nevertheless, an explosion of umami in this course!- Duck, Shishito: I think this is the main course of the meal based on how it is placed right in middle of the 12 course meal, and as depicted as the ""full moon"" on the menu. I think this might be one of the best duck I've ever had! It has a smoky yet very tender flavor profile. The shishito puree also was as close to perfection as it can be. I personally LOVED the shishito puree. Definitely one of my favorite course that night!- Kimedai, Fennel, Yuzu. (8th photo): Kinmedai (golden eye snapper) is one of my favorite fish, and thus it has made my highlights. The fish skin is slightly seared to crisp. The fish itself is very juicy and full of flavor. The fennel and yuzu was a good pairing to balance the savory texture of the fish.Overall: We had a very good experience! The service was spectacular as expected from a Michelin rated restaurant. Our servers were knowledgeable and it made our experience much more enjoyable. Would highly recommend to anyone who's looking for fine dining w/ a great kaiseki experience!"

2379,KxARz7mHl5O5gR3P-AgmnQ,9/25/2021,2 star rating,"I trusted my friend. I wanted dessert to end my day, and froyo sounded about right. However, this isn't Red Mango or Pinkberry. When I came, which was around 4PM, they told me at checkout they only had Chocolate and their flavor of the day, which was Peanut Butter. They didn't even have many flavors to begin with. And stupid me felt trapped like I was at the cafeteria, deciding between frozen pizza or string beans or something. I could have backed out my order, but instead chose Chocolate to go with my Mango and Gummi Bears topping, which was originally intended for the Original flavor froyo!Ok, it's not their fault that chocolate just doesn't go with mangoes. But the way it was executed here made the taste far worse. For $10, the portion size was enormous and honestly way more than anyone even intends to eat for froyo! The toppings also weren't on top but were on the bottom, so the small mango bits were really rolling in the deep of that muddy looking chocolate.The taste of the ""froyo"" was more like ice cream, as I could barely taste any froyo. Absurdly overpriced for way too much for a dessert, this was quite possibly my most disastrous order I ever made. Service wasn't even great as the worker barely cracked a smile."

The original flavor was sweet and tart, can't go wrong with the OG. Mango was the best (tasted pretty fresh). The strawberries were a bit of a letdown since they were frozen and the cookie dough was way too sweet in my opinion. They were generous with the amount of fro-yo and toppings!I didn't know caramel sauce went so well with fro-yo until that day. Definitely recommend!P.S Major props to the workers for dealing with rude customers as I witnessed on that day.

Also the other location always tends to have more flavors than this location. Today they only had plain, which is okay to me anyway. At 59th, you can feel like you're away from the mall for a moment. At this location, you're still in the mall. I love the music they had playing in the background.

Their frozen yogurt is amazing. I usually get the plain (tart), but sometimes I'll go for the flavor of the day, if it's something yummy like mango. You can also mix flavors. The prices are a little on the high side ($6 for regular and $8 for large, before toppings), but the portions are also very large, especially the large size. It's a mountain of frozen yogurt enough for two or three people and honestly a good deal."

2395,mZOsij0jxAUF3HM8rRMlFQ,11/16/2022,1 star rating,The service here is absolutely horrible. All of the waiters are extremely rude. We asked to put our order in 4 times and they ignored us. Once we finally ordered the chicken was not cooked and we said something they literally argued with us and told us we were wrong. Would NOT recommend unless you want to be bullied by the staff.

The service was EXTREMLEY slow- but once you got them there food started coming. I got the dinner bento box and it was a hearty amount of food for $35.

They offer radish and limes as garnish, and double the corn tortilla so that it doesnt get wet and fall apart on your paper plate. Theyre also speedy- Four tacos took like five min to cook.I liked the spicy pork the best, but the steak and regular pork were also fire. You can scarf down your food on the counter top, but maybe dont take too long because it gets crowded? You pay at the end, and i think my total was $13 or $12? Something very affordable.

I'm mad safe, cozy, and warm LMFAO. The beer: I told Sweden I wanted a flight of beer. I told her that I'm a Belgium Blonde type of girl. I said pick four that line up with that. And chileeee.

Seems like this spot is buzzing right in this part of Soundview- feet away from the 6.Service is pleasant all around. Our server even made sure to warn us about the Salsa 'being real spicy' (turned out it wasn't- thank you Jesus!). Music added another upbeat layer with Mexican Pop. My Mom loved her Mexican coffee with hints of Cinnamon but my Tamarind Juice, was bland. Menu has lots to choose from and decided on Shrimp Tacos. Unlike me, my Mom, can stomach any type of meat and settled on a Bistec (Steak) with a Sope and Grilled Cactus. My 3 tasty Shrimp Tacos, were packed real nice with queso, Cilantro and lettuce- and I was in flavor heaven when I added a squeeze of lime to them. Mumsy took notice that our Lunch came out too quick- including her Steak. Unfortunately, my Mom complained (in Spanish) that her Steak ""felt like a piece of rubber"". Hey, can't control what the lady says. Anyhow.....It was a nice Shrimp Taco bliss for me. Just kind of wished, my Mom had a similar experience like I did- with her Entree. They have several things going for them- they just need to put more priority on food quality. I'm going with a 3 and a 1/2 on this one. There aren't many Mexican restaurants in Soundview and I think Vista deserves some kind of a shout."

They are now located in the New World Mall food court after a fire at their previous location. Their menu have also expanded a little to include fruit tea (just one unfortunately). I had a lychee black tea (with bursting boba) and it was delicious! Sweet but not sickening sweet with a good tea/lychee flavor."
2439,bn0zZ9nT_j1INOwfpxWmEw,11/26/2022,5 star rating,There are two Tiger Sugars located in Main Street Flushing. The Tiger Sugar located in New World Mall is less packed and busy compared to the one on Main Street. The atmosphere is pretty overwhelming with all the different stores. There is also seating in the food court for customers. Boba was good as usual. The service is fast and efficient.
2440,bn0zZ9nT_j1INOwfpxWmEw,11/14/2022,5 star rating,Tiger sugar does limited flavors but fancy varieties. If you're ok with a single flavor. Get their pudding boba as it has giant chunks of super soft custard inside (almost like flan). It's delicious and they're pretty fast at making drinks.
2441,bn0zZ9nT_j1INOwfpxWmEw,11/10/2022,5 star rating,My favorite drinks from tiger sugar is the number 1. I love the small bubbles that is added to the drink and the big bubbles are easy to chew. The tea it self is perfect and is not too sweet.
2442,bn0zZ9nT_j1INOwfpxWmEw,10/11/2022,5 star rating,This drink contains mostly milk. It has cream mousse and tapioca inside. Balls are fragile and small. Easy to chew. Taste sweet and smooth. Have to shake for few seconds before putting in the straw.

2444,bn0zZ9nT_j1INOwfpxWmEw,9/12/2022,3 star rating,Tiger Sugar serves a unique brown sugar boba that is tasty and the perfect texture. The taste of the tea itself is like a normal brown sugar boba milk tea. The boba is very tender and chewy but they are all shaped in different sizes making some of the boba really small and hard to chew because it is so small. It is a little difficult sometimes to chew the boba fully due to the size. The price is a normal cost for boba but tiger sugar isn't my go to spot.
2445,bn0zZ9nT_j1INOwfpxWmEw,7/17/2022,2 star rating,"The two points of downfall for this place come down to the unreasonably bitter tea masked with sweetening and the inflexibility for customers to choose anything other than 100%, 50%, or no sweetness levels. The bubble tea market is pretty competitive and customer satisfaction is key to repeat business, plus all other similar businesses offer either 20%, 25%, or 30% sweetness. All in all, their boba is consistently tender which is a welcome change and fun to try, but not when it's dropped in a tea that so impossibly sweet that it sickens me to finish. I hope they improve and do well, but I'm doubtful that I'll be returning."

I can place my order and get it within 5 minutes now! Tiger Sugar definitely still is my favorite place to go to for brown sugar boba (I prefer this over XFT). I stop by once in a while when I'm in Flushing & always get their signature #1 drink ($6)! It seems like the drink is not as sweet as when they first opened, but I still enjoy this as a little treat every so often."

Tiny bar up front but a nice setup outside with several long tables as well as TV's.Considering this was a group party - the price of food and drink was included in our package (which was great that this was an option). Around fifteen different beers on draft, various styles at around $6-9 a pint. Food is your basic bar grub - mozzarella sticks, sliders, chicken tenders, and the like. Sliders were the best of the bunch, easy to eat and not overcooked. Best part of the spot was the service. The bartenders were super accommodating, and even helped move people's belongings when it started raining. Not really in the neighborhood often, but would come back to support this bar."

Makes for a relatively safe way to meet friends over drinks or food. Thoroughly enjoyed the Cider Donut draft.Honestly dangerous as it masks the alcohol well, though may come off a little on the sweet side. Would definitely order again. Enjoyed the dry rub fries ($7.95) though I'd say they're nothing to write home about - seasoning had a mild kick but largely flavorless. The fries are thick cut and filling, however, so gets the job done when you're not starving.Can't comment on the various specialty hot dogs as i did not try any.Service was swift and welcoming. Did not feel hounded by the bartender or waiter to order or pay. We were allowed to hang out until near closing, and overall felt like a very layed back experience."

They offer a great selection of draft beers and they've got some pretty good hot dogs and wings as well. Aside from the drinks and food though, the chill energy of this place and the great service is what keeps me coming back. Not to mention they have board games to play which is perfect for when you're catching up with friends and having a couple drinks. This has easily become one of my go-to spots in Bay Ridge!"

2457,JVuNvnj0WgCOgp4ML-hggA,2/6/2023,4 star rating,"I'm so happy they renovated! It's definitely more bright and welcoming now! I come here quite often because they're open pretty late and plus, their prices are pretty fair for the most part (the only thing I can't comprehend is why a piece of bread on a skewer is like $2.50+ but other than that, I like their prices). The beef and lamb skewers (as I was told - since I'm allergic to lamb, I wouldn't know) are very good options because they're always juicy and flavorful. The food (applies to skewers and entree items) aren't very spicy but you could always request for it to be spicier or if you're dining in, they also have dry seasoning/spices available at the table for you to add to your food. It's a small environment so it does get crowded pretty quickly. I've read many reviews on the poor customer service but I think it's kind of subjective to each individual. I'm a big-city girl and I travel a lot so naturally, what most would consider ""bad/rude service"" is really just normal service to me. I actually think they're nice here. The girl at the desk who's got a fiesty temper everyone complains about is actually my favorite type of personality! The very first time I came to order To-Go, she thought I couldn't speak Chinese at first and tried to accommodate me even though she was clearly struggling (she doesn't know how to say $11 so she said ""total is one-one""). She was so relieved to hear me speak Chinese and every experience I had after that was pretty decent. I do want to point out however (since I've been here 9+ times now) - the taste of the food is not always consistent (always juicy though!) and certain items get sold out on certain days of the week... So when you do come here and if you actually like the food you get, aim to come back the same day of the week and around same time the next time you return."

I always get the spicy clams and many of the skewer options that they have. The boss lady is so sweet and remembers me and my friends everytime we come. They have many drinks including alcohol. Definitely recommend!

The crazy waitress said I don't want your business and take your money back and get the fuck out of here. So I said that's fucked up. You can't refuse business.  Then she pushed customer physically. She was like you think I don't understand English? Your not welcome at my shop. She told all of her customers I cursed her out because I said ""that's fucked up""?  This place needs to shut down!!!!! Very unprofessional and rude to customer! You don't put your hand on customer. Honestly, I wish I can give zero star here."

I also love this place because they are open late too. I regret not trying this place earlier. Such a great place! The vibe they have reminds me of izakayas in my hometown in Japan. The lady working here was nice and friendly. Also if you don't eat much spicy food, ask for very little spicy. We asked for just little spicy and it was very spicy for me too even though I'm really good at spicy food."

I recommend the vegetables, lamp, tofu slides, and chicken wings. Don't really recommend the pot cuz it doesn't taste as flavorful as the BBQ ones. We come here only for BBQ, not for the fried rice, dumpling or wonton... I have to say those fried rice or dumpling wonton soup are pricy for what you'll get.. but like I said, it's not a place for those type of food. It's just a simple Chinese style BBQ place. The waitress is very sweet and always offer me the warmest seats when I went in a cold winter day. I really like their BBQ!"

Flavors are right and so are the prices.I've moved away but still always order from here whenever I'm back in the area visiting.No matter what you order, just make sure to get the Crispy Wings as an app. The crispiest I've had and the sauce is a nice touch.The pad Thai is not too watery as some have noted in other reviews. Drunken noodle is also a favoriteAnd would say the Massaman is my go to curry.All in all, the portions are generous, wait time is quick, meals are delicious, and it wont break the bank.Love this place."
2468,io73CG07m5_w9TP3_rl8DQ,12/14/2022,1 star rating,"There's other reviews mentioning this, but the ""chicken"" is extremely suspicious. I don't leave many reviews, but I just needed to share this. The chicken really did not taste, look, smell, or feel like chicken. It was rubbery, didn't pull apart like chicken, the bite just wasn't right, and something tasted off. I hate to say it but we thought maybe it was some other bird similar to a chicken, like a duck or something- I have zero clue. At first I tried saying that it was maybe the way it was the way it was cooked, but it was really just strange when I found a lump. Me and my boyfriend were equally as confused as to what this meat was. If there's any explanation for this I'd love to hear it, because what I received was not chicken."
2469,io73CG07m5_w9TP3_rl8DQ,2/1/2021,4 star rating,"Decided to try this place out despite all the negative reviews. It was definitely a gamble but a friend of my boyfriends said it wasn't as bad as the reviews had put it. We ordered through UberEats and got a chicken pad Thai, chicken pad kee mao (drunken noodles), papaya salad, and Thai crispy chicken wings. Upon receiving our order, everything looked pretty good but I do have to say the chicken pad Thai was indeed on the watery side like some of the reviews had pointed out so that's something to keep in mind. It did get less watery as time went on but definitely saucier than how pad Thai is. The drunken noodles were actually really good and had good flavor to them with the right consistency! I liked the papaya salad as it was refreshing and a good size. The Thai spicy chicken wings were good but honestly tasted like any other Chinese takeout fried chicken. The only different was they provided a sweet and sour sauce but there was nothing Thai about this dish. Portions were big too and we were both stuffed at the end of our meal. Honestly would reorder from here if we ever crave Thai and want something nearby. Yes there are better Thai places but I don't think our experience was as terrible as the reviews had it."
2470,io73CG07m5_w9TP3_rl8DQ,11/7/2020,3 star rating,"We had the duck curry with lychee, papaya salad and shrimp pad Thai. The curry was yummy- roasted skin on duck sautéed with peppers and string beans in a yellow sweet curry and a genius addition of lychees! Too bad there were only 4! Lychees in the entire order and we found the veggies to be a bit sparse so the dish was swimming in albeit yummy sauce. The papaya salad was bland and had 2 tomato chunks- completely underwhelming it's cost of even $7. The pad Thai was heavily ladened with a soy, peanut coating that necessitates a side of white rice. I prefer mine much drier but if I had to have it wet, this would be a good option. Overall, a satisfactory meal but costly. Had we not ordered with a steep ubereats coupon (cuz we'd never use UE otherwise w their exorbitant fees), we would not be able to justify Thai Basil's prices."
2471,io73CG07m5_w9TP3_rl8DQ,2/15/2021,5 star rating,"Awesome Thai spot in the area! Despite the low reviews, I took a chance to order from them because I never had a problem with their food before covid. I ordered crispy calamari, beef pad Thai, and beef drunken noodles and this was more than enough for 2 people. The noodle dishes was decently big and filling. The drunken noodles was packed with flavor. The calamari was very crispy. The pad Thai did have some sauce on it but the flavor was there; it's really not bad compared to other places. I personally isn't a fan of any pad Thai because of the stickiness and dryness but I enjoyed their pad Thai. Highly recommend these three dishes from Thai basil. Food- 5/5Price- 5/5Service- 5/5"
2472,io73CG07m5_w9TP3_rl8DQ,2/2/2021,3 star rating,"Small location, but solid food!Unfortunately, there aren't many Thai restaurants in Sheepshead Bay and, in fact, as of 2021, I believe there is only 1 ... yes, ONLY 1 ... because Gata Thai closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fortunately, Thai Basil is a very viable Thai option and will somewhat satisfy your Thai cravings.The restaurant is 100% takeout, pre- and during the COVID-19 pandemic and is conveniently listed on Seamless and Grubhub. Their menu offers a variety of appetizers, soups, your typical Thai rice and noodle dishes, curries and drinks. My family has ordered a few large pickup orders in the past and we usually ordered the same items. I won't list out every one, but I will mention a few observations, both positive and negative.First, generally-speaking, their food is OK. Nothing will blow you away flavor-wise, but nothing is egregiously terrible. As for what's good? You cannot go wrong with the Pineapple Fried Rice, Beef Satay, String Beans or noodle dishes.  Also, the curries aren't bad either and go perfect with white rice. On the flip side, I highly DO NOT recommend the Grilled Steak because it is a very ""cheap"" piece of steak that is way overly cooked and far from tender. In addition, it's considerably more expensive than the other dishes and the serving is very small. For drinks, DEFINITELY go for the Thai Iced Tea - it washes everything down just right.Overall, Thai Basil is an average, local Thai restaurant. Honestly, I preferred Gata Thai over Thai Basil, but Gata Thai was a much, much smaller operation and Thai Basil is more suitable for producing entrees for family-style meals. Unfortunately, Sheepshead Bay is only down to 1 Thai restaurant and all I can say is that it isn't all that bad .... but it isn't all that great either."
2473,io73CG07m5_w9TP3_rl8DQ,4/4/2022,5 star rating,"Best Thai food in the area. I've been thinking about the food we ordered for weeks now. The pad Thai has a delicious flavor and they don't leave your noodles high and dry. The fried tofu was crunchy and wonderful. The satay was immaculate. The store even has fair pricing - especially for Brooklyn. I've only eaten from here once, but I know for sure I'm coming back!"
2474,io73CG07m5_w9TP3_rl8DQ,6/12/2021,3 star rating,Ordered delivery. Food was cooked quickly. Large portions. The green papaya salad was very bland. The Madsaman curry was also very bland. Did not have any peanuts. Or flavor. Maybe their other dishes are better
2475,io73CG07m5_w9TP3_rl8DQ,8/15/2021,4 star rating,"I ordered from here for the first time when I was picking up food to drop off at a friend's place. She requested pad see yu noodles, and we ordered drunken noodles (pad kee mao). She said her meal was yummy. I enjoyed the drunken noodles and ordered them spicy but they were not really spicy, so if you're looking for a bit more heat, I would order extra spicy from them, since spicy was very moderate. I think it was very flavorful but not like many other kee mao dishes I have ordered. I called in the order and they were fairly quick for pickup. If you can, call them directly, rather than ordering from seamless or grubhub (those apps take 30% from these mom and pop restaurants....) All in all a good dinner!"
2476,io73CG07m5_w9TP3_rl8DQ,10/31/2020,3 star rating,Delivery was quick. We ordered a tom yum soup with shrimp and we needed to add our own hot sauce to give it flavor and heat. We also got the coconut sticky rice with mango. The mangoes were not ripe yet and the rice didnt mix with the coconut milk so it tasted like microwaved rice dumped in coconut milk. Theres much room for improvement.

We also had the mussels in a white wine garlic sauce which also comes with small crispy bread to dip in your sauce.

There's comfy couch seating, tables, and seats at the bar - lots of variety depending on the vibe you're looking for. We stayed for many hours and did not get bored. When the backyard closed, we moved inside, and the change of scenery made it even more fun. The drinks are carefully crafted and are excellent.

This dude was on his phone right in front of me and my friend for ten mins while he knew we were sitting there without drinks and waiting to order. Then when we did finally get served he kept calling us: honey, sweetheart, babe or some other such iteration that really is not charming, cool or necessary. Like I hated myself for giving this place another go after being there for 30 mins. 15 of which was spent waiting. There was one bright light, I think there was a shift change right before we left and a guy called (I think!) Michael started working behind the bar and he was an absolute delight. Polite, funny and attentive. I hope I got his name right because he deserves all the praise. But sadly it's not enough to make me ever come back."

2516,J99VVAUid72FNwEqiSEnHg,5/7/2021,4 star rating,"Grabbed some drinks at Givers And Takers on Wednesday night. A very cool bar with excellent drinks and a comfortable space.Quality: Givers And Takers manages to toe the line between upscale cocktail bar and casual bar. It has an assortment of drinks that showcase the skills and ingenuity of the bartenders, but they also understand the need to just enjoy a simple beer. During our visit I tried several of the cocktails including, the Mezcal Jalapeno Marg, Paper Plane, and Aperol Spritz. I also couldn't resist snagging a can of Heady Topper. The Mezcal Jalapeno Marg was a highlight, as they really upped the spiciness with a ton of jalapeno, but it worked so well with the smokey mezcal flavor. I also am never going to complain about a place that has Heady Topper readily available. Quantity: Stiff and tasty drinks and fair pours of beer. Value: $12-$14 for Cocktails. $8 for Draught Beers. $10 for a Heady Topper.Ambiance: Givers And Takers is located in Gowanus, in an area with a few other bars and restaurants. Currently they have two outdoor areas, a temporary wooden structure on the street out front and then a lovely little  patio in the back. There are only a few tables on the back patio, but on a nice day, it is definitely the place to be. Inside they have some tables lined up towards the front, then a long bar that stretches from the center of the space to the back. When we arrived tons of light splashed into the bar from the patio, but as it gets darker, the space dims and it feels quite sophisticated. My only complaint is the music did not make it out front, which was a shame because jams were playing inside.Crowd: It was beautiful weather, so the two outdoor areas quickly filled up after 5pm. A few groups of friends, including a run club, as well as some couples with dogs made up the crowd.Service: Wonderful bartender running the show. It was fairly busy for a Wednesday evening, but she was able to easily handle the crowd.Parking: Decent street parking in the nearby area."

My friend and I came in after having dinner next door for a few drinks to end the night. It wasn't busy at all by Friday night bar standards, which we thought was a win.After waiting 30 minutes to even be acknowledged by the bartender for service, when we finally did put in our order (French 75 + a seltzer) he proceeded to take other customer's orders while ignoring us, walking around the bar, joking with patrons, and clearing and cleaning glasses. Multiple people who had come in after us and/or had placed their orders after us were given their drinks before we were. Then when we politely reminded him about our order, he got defensive and claimed that he remembered but that the other people he was serving were in line before us (they weren't, and were talking to us about the terrible service while we were all waiting for him to remember to serve us our drinks). He then told us to go and sit down and he'd bring the drinks over to us when they were ready. Ten minutes later he ran over and asked if I wanted Hendricks in my French 75, which is not the correct gin to use, so I said no a different gin, please. 10 minutes after that, he brought over a cocktail that was pure watered down well gin with a lemon wedge--no bubbles, no lemon juice that I could taste, and no simple syrup--and told me to taste it in front of him. Because the drink was so strong and not at all what I was expecting when I ordered a French 75, I couldn't control my face and he got upset when I politely told him that ""it was fine,"" just so he would leave us alone. He told me that I was ""a bad liar"" and asked me to tell him exactly what was wrong with the drink. I'm not a bartender, but I've made and had French 75s before, and the one thing I know for sure was missing was the Prosecco, which is what I told him. He said that he added that and demanded I tell him what else was wrong...this went on for a bit until he could tell I was getting flustered. He offered to make it again, but I didn't want to wait another 30-45 minutes for another non-drinkable cocktail. I had 2 sips, left a $20 on the bar, and then we left. I 100% understand that post-COVID, bars can be understaffed and he was the only bartender working, but there seemed to be a prioritization of joking around vs focusing on the job at hand and lack of base knowledge for basic cocktails, which, for a bartender at a cocktail bar, seemed odd. It was strange and a bit of a red flag to me that he was relying on the menu to look at the ingredients for every drink he made in the 30 minutes we were standing and waiting for our order. Highly disappointed with my experience here tonight. If I ever come back, I'll be sticking to beer or well liquor/seltzer. TL;DR: bartender ignored us, was rude when interacting with us, and then didn't know how to make the cocktail on the menu that was ordered, and was not drinkable when it was (finally) served. Stick to beer/wine/shots."

The Yelp Gods bestowed a blessing on us and curiosity lead us to a table here. This is a small, warm and intimate bar ideal for catching up with friends or perfect for romantic dates. This place has such a relaxing sensual VIBE we were lured to stop in.The warm candles and dim lit lighting is so eye catching. Once you pass this place, you have no choice but to follow the smooth tunes and order a drink. When we walked by we heard Debarge "" I like it "" playing and my friend says "" I hear a vibe "". She nailed it. After walking for awhile we found ourselves right back here. You can't help but GIVE IN. Seats at the bar and on the patio garden were full so we decided on one of the tables/ booth closest to the door. The bartender was super friendly and suggested we try a Paloma that was refreshing. I love tequila so this was perfect. The downside here is that they don't sell food. This place would be so crowded if they did have a kitchen. It began to pour down rain while we were enjoying our drinks and this was the best place to get trapped in during heavy showers. This bar has very modern and chic decor. I am in love with the light fixtures and comfortable leather booths. I was able to put my feet up and relax to the smooth tunes while enjoying a ""Paloma"" (tequila, grapefruit soda, lime). So refreshing to be at a bar where the noise level after midnight is light and music is soothing. Whoever decides on the playlist here. You're a blessing. Such a dope combo of Old and new and all genres intertwined. I'd definitely come back."

My friends & I waited and waited and WAITED to get our very simple drink orders, and she she spent that whole time flirting with a customer, not making so much as a token effort to make our drinks. When we asked to close out instead of getting our order, she became aggressive and swore at my friend, who was only requesting the bare minimum of service. I really hope some of the other bartenders here care at least a LITTLE about providing gracious service (truly, we would have settled for adequate) and can provide a half-decent experience to customers."

I politely asked the bartender if he'd be able to make me a new one. Right off the bat, he was incredibly, inexplicably combative and rude. When he refused to make me another drink, I asked him to take the drink back, as it was undrinkable, (and he did) and ordered a single glass of Prosecco. As he poured it he said ""this Prosecco was in the drink. I've been drinking it in mimosas all day and it tastes [expletive] fine to me.""Cut to paying the bill. I offered to pay for the cocktail (as it was more expensive) and he insisted that since I had two drinks he was ""going to [expletive] charge me for two drinks."" He continued, raising his voice, ""In seven years of owning this place I've never had a single customer send a drink back. I'm not your [expletive] slave. You think we need you and your business? We [expletive] don't."" I replied, in shock at his disproportionate response, that this was a terrible customer experience, and that the way he was speaking to me was really upsetting. He told me he was justified in shouting at me because it was a ""terrible [expletive] experience for him, too"" and ""despite what [I]'ve been told, the customer isn't always right."" I never once was argumentative or rude, and I never raised my voice. At that point I felt uncomfortable and frankly, unsafe. My fiancé and his friend had come over to the bar because they'd heard the commotion and wanted to see if everything was okay. It wasn't, but we just paid the full tab and left.If you have a different bartender here, then you might have a great experience. But this bartender owns the place and the way that he treated me--not only as a customer but simply as a human being--was appalling. But, as it turns out, they don't want or need my business, so I guess we all win?"

Curries tasted good when thought of as it's own dish, but when compared with more authentic Indian food they lacked flavor and spice. The vegetable curry had a lot of vegetables which was nice, but the lamb curry tasted a little too sweet and one dimensional. The samosa chat was okay but a little too soggy and not super flavorful. We did order everything as takeout though so everything probably taste better in store."

I wanted for about 20 minutes so you know they really cook the food and don't just throw it in microwave. I got the Chicken Tandoori and the Gobi Manchurian. The names sounded interesting...I still don't know what Gobi is but it hit lowkey.

My London fog (with oat milk) was done right and they have the options for different sweeteners if you prefer agave! But something that intrigued me about this spot as opposed to other cafes is their pastry and baked goods sections. As apparent by the name, there's a couple more German pastries available through the baked good window but overall they have a nice assortment. They even have caneles which are hard to make. They have desserts in the same window and also in the fridge near the register. They had a nice looking mousse which I enjoyed. Of course, depending on when you go, some things would not be available. I think I was the last one to get the egg and bacon sandwich when I ordered it (plus it is actual egg and not egg byproduct).Other than that, I think it is chill. They prefer cash to card, they have hours and sections which they say no to laptops so it might not be your optimal work space but I say it is pretty decent"

Pandemic:Prior to pandemic, we enjoyed having breakfast and brunch there, and visited this place every weekend at least once, and even went there once for dinner for Valentine's prepared by the chefs, Bjorn and Greg. Their food, for a cafe - is pricey, but we felt that it was worth it.When the pandemic hit, we still continued to buy their food and felt that we should support the owners by buying more things from this place.  2022This year, a large dead branch which was on a tree in the backyard of Der Pioneer's cafe fell on my head while I was sitting outside with a coffee.  I was in pain for months and once in a while, I experience pain in that spot of my head where the branch fell. The owner - Bjorn did not remove the dead branches from the very tall old tree which is a hazard to his customers right away when we complained.  It took him several weeks to do it, and we did not visit his place during those weeks.  I don't remember any great concern, nor apology nor empathy being offered to me, although this was physical damage that occurred and the owner is responsible.  We never thought of suing because we cared about this cafe as part of our neighborhood.  Spending our valuable time on travelling to this cafe:Der Pioneer is not close to us, and it takes time to drive there, and many times we experienced getting there and finding in the morning or the middle of the day between 11am and 2pm there were no bagels, no galettes, no crumble cake, and no biscuits for sale. Not sure if they were not baked that day, but we were told that they have ran out. For that reason, we would call in advance like 9am or 10am to put aside the baked goods that we liked for later pick up.  And Bjorn usually did it for us, or his employees did it.  We then would pick it up and there was no problem.The soups:I love the Kambocha soup when it is fresh. One time we bought it and brought it home and discovered that it was unfresh and soured, so we threw it out and never asked for a refund.   At the end of August 2022, we requested as usual to put things aside for us, and Bjorn agreed to do so. We planned to get together in his cafe that day with one of our dear friends to show him a nice cafe and to enjoy our experience.  However, on that day there was rain and our friend got stuck in traffic and could only spare as a result very limited time to only meet with us.  Next day, we called Bjorn and apologized for not picking up the baked goods we expected to pick up; we wanted to get our day old fresh baked ordered goods.  However, Bjorn informed us in a rude manner that he threw all the baked goods we requested out, and they are not available anymore and next time my partner should ""stand in line and buy it like everyone else."" My partner apologized, asked to pay him for them, and wanted to continue to speak about this issue to resolve it, but he quickly hung up on him without waiting for our further response.  Since then we asked his staff to contact us and speak with us to resolve this conflict, but did not receive any response.  We were so concerned on that weekend that after we spoke to Bjorn, we drove up there to speak to him, but he was not available.  We also left a request to speak to him via square feedback and did not receive any response either. We also learned from his employee that Biorn had separated from his partner and they no longer work together.  So here is our written response:Biorn you were very rude to my partner and out of line when you spoke to him and did not care how he felt about you throwing out our food, and then telling us to stand in line. We stood in line every time we came for coffee and to obtain our ordered food. Also we know what it is like to stand in line, so don't give us a lecture about standing in line as if we are children.  There was no reason for you to throw out our food.  Secondly, you are disrespectful to your customers who supported you during pandemic while you were repeatedly complaining about your business.  We know how to support.  We only asked to put our food aside because there no reason why we should travel to you to come in to an empty shop.  Your attitude to customers is not very nice.Keep in mind that you should appreciate the business that you are given by people who make an effort to think of your shop, call you to put away your goods, come in and pay for it for years, and for traveling this distance. We did not appreciate your expression of your negativity on our weekend. We wanted resolve it, but obviously you are only interested in only your perspective. Furthermore, since we did not get a response from you, we are more than happy to go to another cafe, and enjoy it with our friends.  Good luck with your business.  We don't plan to return.You owe us an apology."

I also had the runs after eating this $9 sandwich. I will not buy another sandwich from here again. I would have preferred to have the sandwich freshly made and then have the mayo on the side. The other side of the sandwich had mustard on it which was a surprise. I'm not sure what on the sandwich messed with my digestive system but I'll stick to their baked goods instead.

2555,J85NKgA4tOgBAoqxu0vBNw,3/7/2023,4 star rating,Decent sushi/ramen spot. I liked that they had quality versions of both since we were craving both. The shrimp tempura roll was good and what you'd expect. The ramen was very flavorful with a lot of depth. The place is a bit pricey but it's what you'd expect for the location.
2556,J85NKgA4tOgBAoqxu0vBNw,3/26/2023,1 star rating,"I wanted to like this place so much because the sushi was good and fresh BUT there was a hair in my shumai and it ruined my appetite and the entire experience. The server acted like it was normal and although he asked if I wanted a replacement (I said no) he removed it from the bill and that was that. No apology, nothing. It ruined my meal and if they normalize hair being in your food then that's not a place I want to go to. Eat there at your own risk. No matter how good the sushi can be, I don't want to eat hair; thanks but no thanks."

2563,J85NKgA4tOgBAoqxu0vBNw,2/16/2023,2 star rating,"I have been here once before and I thought the sushi was good. But the reason I'm giving it 2 stars is not because of the food but my experience on my last visit (2/15). I sat at the bar and ordered a drink and when I got it I noticed that there was a ring at the bottom of the glass, I thought it would've been from when he poured the drink so I asked for paper napkins to clean the table and within a few minutes I saw a ring under my glass again so I thought that's quite strange, so I picked up the glass and when I did I CUT MY HAND!! The drink was leaking because the glass was CRACKED!!!! I told the waiter and he was sorry, but he didn't really do anything about it. After that happened, he disappeared and I got a new waiter who had no clue about what had happened. I asked for the Salmon Paradise and I never got my miso soup that is included with the meal. I later asked for my food to be boxed and when I got home there was no soy sauce when I specifically asked him to put packets of soy sauce in the to go bag. When I received the check, I was expecting that AT LEAST I'd get my drink as complimentary since I CUT MY HAND with their glass, but nope! Not even the drink!! Paid the entire check, had to sign it with my left hand because I couldn't even hold the pen with my right hand. So the place is fine, sushi is good (pricey but I guess it's ok for NYC) but my review is low ONLY because I wasn't expecting to go have dinner and end up getting injured. They should check their dishes after they clean them to make sure they're not a hazard for the customers."
2564,-RPe5PyA3Za3_iv7strJ_g,12/19/2021,4 star rating,Favorite place in Greenpoint to pick up chicken soup! We usually get two quarts at a time. Their chicken soup is super flavorful and comforting especially when you're sick or cold!! Ordered a jelly donut and a variety of mini donuts. I wouldn't really call this a donut. The dough felt more like a bread... like a jelly bread. There wasn't a lot of jelly filling (as seen in the picture) I didn't even end up finishing the mini donuts.
2565,-RPe5PyA3Za3_iv7strJ_g,10/2/2021,4 star rating,"I come here for their pastries. Each quarter slab comes to approximately $7. My favorite by far is the poppy seed layer cake! It's so moist, with layers of custard, poppy seed sponge, and topped with cherry jam(?) and chocolate ganache. Unfortunately they didn't sell them today, so I settled for their almond fantasy cake. It had a jelly-like texture, which was a bit strange. The almond marzipan flavor was spot on, with crunchy walnut bits and fruit mixed inside. Their poppyseed cheesecake and napoleonka are just average and not that memorable."
2566,-RPe5PyA3Za3_iv7strJ_g,1/31/2022,5 star rating,"This is the place! Bakestone Bakery ( formerly Northside) is THE place for the best prepared home cooked comfort food in Greenpoint. In a rapidly gentrifying hood full of $36/lb cheese and charcuterie arrivistes it dire is nice to have a place nearby where you can take home full home cooked European meals for under $15/head. After hitting beautiful McGolrick Park you come here for a simple meal of fresh pierogis, Greenpoints best chicken and vegetable soups and sweet cheese and fruit filled blintzes. Their chicken cutlets, stuffed cabbage (meat or yummy vegetarian with kasha and mushroom sauce) and vegetable/potato babkas/puddings also terrific. D be another Gentrifying Tool.

It's a typical small coffee shop run by eastern Europeans. The lady, who's probably related to the owners (or she could be one of the owners), recognized me and asked about how I had been as she didn't see me in a long while. It's good to be recognized, especially by people you don't consider friends. Being in the place is a good way to observe the kinds of people who come, live, stay in this part of the neighborhood that is eventually be gone anytime soon. When the giant ferris wheel gets functional in St George, this place together with the whole of Staten Island's north shore will change. I am not sad for that.

We called about 30 minutes ahead to make sure that Coldstone was open and they said yes but only for delivery or pick up on Seamless. We ordered on seamless and about 25 minutes later we go to pick it up. There are 3 people working behind the counter. When my sister goes in and asked about the order the man behind the counter was rude, saying ""We aren't Dunkin' Donuts"" completely uncalled for and unprovoked. So after another 20 minute wait we go back inside and again are met with rudeness. they tell us we have to wait outside while another man was waiting in the lobby... wow okay. I stayed inside and waited another 10 minutes and finally my order was done. I understand that there is a pandemic going on and that it can be stressful, but there is no reason for the staff to be rude off the bat... And if they were that busy they could have let us know that when we called almost an hour before. Definitely won't be returning to this location and i don't recommend that anyone reading this goes here. Try Van Leeuwen's or OddFellows, fresh home made ice cream with no attitude."

This isn't fresh as advertised or don't like the idea that I got a small box and wasn't paying attention because I'm NYC, I was one of the photographer and videographer covering TCS NYC road Runner's marathon and I was hungry. Didn't eat anything since 5am other than water and Gatorade. The food was too cold to even give this box a state of flavor. When warm up, I think I nuke the flavors and it wasn't very good to my optional.So I end up going back to the hostel and making vegan Philly cheesesteaks and fries. What a waste of time and will not visit again. Sorry to my vegan Bros and sisters but vegan law is never give two day food as take out because it wasn't good.

Je n'ai rien mangé depuis 5 heures du matin à part de l'eau et du Gatorade.  La nourriture était trop froide pour même donner à cette boîte un état de saveur.  Lors de l'échauffement, je pense que j'ai neutralisé les saveurs et ce n'était pas très bon pour mon facultatif. Je finis donc par retourner à l'auberge et faire des cheesesteaks et des frites végétaliens Philly.  Quelle perte de temps et je ne reviendrai pas.  Désolé pour mes frères et sœurs végétaliens, mais la loi végétalienne ne donne jamais de nourriture de deux jours à emporter parce que ce n'était pas bon"

They will treat you different. They asked me for my ID and I was confused because i didn't order any alcohol. What if my father or uncle or boyfriend was treating me and gave me their card to use? Regardless its wrong for a $7 order. To make it worse they didn't do the same to the people ahead of me... maybe because they were men? I don't know. The little things can just ruin an establishment.

But maybe flavor wise it could have packed more flavor, or perhaps they could have included more sauce for it. We were given two small containers of a chile sauce, but next time I'll make sure to ask for extras. The beans were just okay but could have used more salt or maybe they were watered down a bit?

A whopping $20 PER plate for take out...(2 country platters) which would NOT be a problem IF they weren't so stingy. Total bill 48.00 for what? One would expect to get separate white rice and a normal size beans. Nope...everything is smushed into one container. Not to mention beans is the teeny 1/4 size wonton container. Not even the ""regular"" small. Also, it came with zero avocado. This was not an Uber order. We literally called and picked it up. Never again. Make this make sense. The food is no different than any Colombian/DR spot for the type of plate we chose. Chicaron, separate rice, separate beans would cost max 15 bucks anywhere else. And not smushed together. Prices on additional items are astronomical for the SIZE. $5.50 for the teeny wonton container of beans? I'm referring to the size the Chinese give you sweet and sour sauce in. Insane."

They aren't a household name or a buzzy restaurant written up by all the food blogs. They're just your local pizzeria operating mostly on delivery orders and single slice takeaways. My pie was made fresh from the time I ordered it for pickup and was ready about 30-40 minutes later. It carried well through some distance and tasted absolutely phenomenal when I got home. The sauce was tart and tomatoey, there was plenty of fresh garlic and basil in the sauce, and the cheese to sauce to bread ratio was perfect. Even more telling is that I finished every last bite of the crust-- the crispy and fresh edges of each slice were irresistible.I was tempted to chalk up the tastiness of their margarita pie to me being hungry, but eating it heated up the next day I found myself planning my next Prospect Pizza pie order, stat.

Pizza has always been trash but when it's the last resort (I'll review the other two) you do what you gotta do. BUT 3 WHOLE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS FOR A PLAIN SLICE IS ABSURD. The dough is hard. The cheese/sauce/grease ratio is trash. Mind you- I ordered a pepperoni slice so I didn't mind but when I saw that sad plain slice being handed over to me for $3.50...I knew my time with them has run out. I literally just got a slice from the spot on Court St by the movie theater (IYKYK) A pepperoni slice with a medium fruit punch for $4.25. They've never let me down. Go there or to Pinos in the slope or Antonio's on Flatbush if you're really desperate for a slice. Prospect Pizza won't see my hard earned money in 2022

No complaints here. 5/5Philly Steak Pizza: I love a good cheesesteak pizza but this was just okay. The yellow triangle cheese slices were not a good look, too much peppers and not enough seasoning. It was almost what envisioned but missed the mark. 3/5Margherita Pizza: They refer time it as ""Grandma's Pizza"" ... it was unexpectedly a rectangle and it was really good. Basil, mozzarella and sauce. Delicious. 5/5Wings: These were classic buffalo wings. I asked for blue cheese dressing and for 9 wings they gave me one cup. If you really like blue cheese with your wings ask for two.Fries: Fries are admittedly tough to pull off in delivery. These were just meh. They were lukewarm and not really seasoned. 2/5Cheesecake. Solid for what I'd expect from a pizza joint and yet for $4.50 I would have liked an option for a strawberry or pineapple topping. 4/5"

It took 2 hours for them to walk 8 blocks and deliver this pizza which is an obscene amount of time. We called multiple times and each time they said 10-15 minutes which we then waited another 30 mins. Upon arrival the wing sauce was spilled all over the bag. The pizza was cold! They blocked both my number and my friends number after the call and that was when we just asked for an ETA. Overall really shitty delivery even though the pizza was good, after heating it back up in the oven, but who knows, we were starving so it could have been dollar pizza and we wouldn't have known."

And had zero regrets since then. I live in Queens, but periodically visit other boroughs for good food. Again zero regrets. Prospect Pizza is one of the places I make sure I visit when in Brooklyn. I tried a few pizza slices there and oh my!! The vegetables are super fresh, the ratio between cheese and tomato sauce is on point and the dough is dreamy. I truly want to try every flavor there and then decide what's my favorite. I mean, its Brooklyn and it's pizza, what can go wrong there. I secretly wish, I lived in the neighborhood. Mind you, I never go back to the same restaurant/café twice, but this place stole my heart. Do yourself a favor and pay a visit to Prospect Pizza. I highly recommend."

If I ordered sausages peppers and onions on a pie anywhere else, sauce would be a given. Interesting choice PP. Thanks for the speedy service."

The staff and servers are friendly and hip and they help you find a seat and menu quickly! The place is buzzing with friends, lovers, loners and everyone in between. It almost feels like someone famous may walk in. I sat at the bar and ordered a lemony vodka drink that the girls next to me were raving about. They were right. It was refreshing and perfect for brunch. I also took their advice and had the French toast over my usual salmon Benedict. I was not disappointed. Moist, fluffy, eggy and made with a buttery brioche.

We started with a Bellini carafe which was a pretty decent price but too much juice and not enough bubbly. For our meals, he had the Smoked Salmon Benedict and I went with the Steak and Eggs as it's one of the only gluten free options on the menu. Wish they had GF bread for the burger.

I also loved my burger, it was one of the better ones Ive had from a preparation standpoint, I got it with the blue cheese. The ratatouille omlette wasnt really a stand out but it was good. The space outdoors is lots of little cafe tables and chairs, it has a roof on top in case it rains and has one big  group table for shares and large parties. I think I will be back for dinner"

I was a bit disappointed with the French onion soup. I think it's the bread that was used. It was on the bitter side.The hit for the night was the cocktails. I ordered the "" Le Cucumber D' Amour.

We ordered their special of the day which was baked Camembert. This was the best dish we had. My boyfriend got the oysters, which he wasn't overly impressed by. Our artichoke, gnocchi and tuna tartare was mediocre. The lobster bisque was decent, but not great. Overall, we spent a lot of money on food that wasn't high quality.

We ended up getting the R3 (beef brisket in tomato soup) and the original beef noodle soup. Note that both were not spicy but if you do favor it with a little kick you can ask for a side of chilli oil. The soups were both flavorful. You have the option to either have all the items separate for you to do yourself or to have them throw it together for you. We had them do it. Pros - potions are good for the price, soup is flavorful, soup stays hot for a very long time. Cons - didn't care much for the whole pieces of little. Prefer them to be cut up a bit. Didn't care for the noodles much, I was expecting like hand drawn noodle consistency but this was more softer. Needs better chopsticks I feel. The small wooden one makes it pretty difficult to eat with. Overall a nice play to grab a nice hot bowl of noodle soup during the cold winter."

Oh wait, add some noodles to that!Ten Seconds Yunnan Rice Noodles 十秒到雲南過橋米線 is a branch of the popular Chinese noodle chain, Shi Miao Dao 十秒到, whose name roughly translates to ""ready in ten seconds"" (hence the English name of this restaurant). Specializing in cross-bridge noodles, each set is comprised of a bowl of hot soup, rice noodles, and various accompanying ingredients such as thinly sliced meats, fried tofu puffs, wood-ear mushrooms, pickled cabbage, corn, and more.My sister and I came here on an early Tuesday evening, to get away from the cold, and there were plenty of tables available; no wait was necessary. We ordered the Chicken Leg with Mixed Mushroom Rice Noodles for her, the Beef Brisket Rice Noodles with Tomato Soup for me, and a soft-boiled egg and a side of pig intestines to share. Our server asked if it was okay to pre-mix everything (instead of serving each ingredient individually), which we were fine with, and the food arrived at the table in a matter of minutes and extremely hot too. I swear I burned the roof of my mouth, and my gums too, just trying to slurp up some noodles--yes, a very wise decision, I know--but it was worth it (and well... also because spitting it out in public would've been rude). Both broths were extremely rich and flavorful, but I am partial to the tomato; the tenderness of the beef brisket was amazing and I especially loved the tomatoeyness of the broth. My sister enjoyed her order too, though the staff completely forgot and left out her chicken leg until she asked about it.Overall, great experience here! The food was delicious and the staff were very patient and pleasant to interact with. Will definitely be back to try some of the other menu items or maybe just to order another bowl of tomato beef brisket rice noodles :D"

I decided to go with a bit of spice. On my 1st time this week, I got the kimchee beef slices one and I was very impressed, full of flavor and the portion sizes, amazing. The bowls are actually gigantic and not the ones with a dome in the center. The staff lady was very nice and sweet. And then on Wednesday, the service wasn't as good, I'd say. It felt like the staff were purposely not making eye contact with us or something? And would walk away before we finished our sentences. But on this 2nd time I ordered the pepper sliced beef.

I came here with my fiancé and friend on a Sunday afternoon and it was super busy! That's how you know the restaurant serves some good food. Though it was busy, we only waited for around 10 minutes for a table for 3 which isn't bad at all considering we didn't make any prior reservation. Will be back to try the other menu items but highly recommend this spot if you're looking for some delicious rice noodles!"

For appetizer, we got the cold cut chicken with chili sauce to share. Extremely tasty! It got the numbing heat from the sichuan peppercorn yet it was not too spicy! The chicken itself was also very juicy and tender! As for the noodle, we got one pickled pepper beef, one spicy brisket, and one tomato brisket. All the broth was very flavorful and my favorite broth was probably the spicy one! It has 3 chili peppers on the menu but I don't think it was too spicy! The tomato broth was a little too sour for my taste but my friend liked it! The portion size of the noodle soups where huge and they all came with a big bowl of noodle! We couldn't finish it all so we just packed up the leftover! Overall, great experience here! Staff was nice and food came out quickly. One minor critique is that there's quite a lot of msg in the broth. I don't mind the use of msg but it made us very thirsty afterwards. Will definitely come back if I'm around that area again!"

Which was fine, but u turn around and let 2 people party sit at the table we just asked. The noodles and soup was fine but the beef was very beefy (& I love steak) but it was not a nice beefy taste.

The spice is more of a numbing spice. If your not good with spices, I would say definitely stick to the original, which you can enjoy more of the natural flavors there. The beef brisket itself was flavor along with the other sides that came in the dish. Broth was spicy, oily and numbing. Great place to try some something unique like Yunnan noodles if your not accustomed to this profile of taste."

We ended up getting the R3 (beef brisket in tomato soup) and the original beef noodle soup. Note that both were not spicy but if you do favor it with a little kick you can ask for a side of chilli oil. The soups were both flavorful. You have the option to either have all the items separate for you to do yourself or to have them throw it together for you. We had them do it. Pros - potions are good for the price, soup is flavorful, soup stays hot for a very long time. Cons - didn't care much for the whole pieces of little. Prefer them to be cut up a bit. Didn't care for the noodles much, I was expecting like hand drawn noodle consistency but this was more softer. Needs better chopsticks I feel. The small wooden one makes it pretty difficult to eat with. Overall a nice play to grab a nice hot bowl of noodle soup during the cold winter."

Oh wait, add some noodles to that!Ten Seconds Yunnan Rice Noodles 十秒到雲南過橋米線 is a branch of the popular Chinese noodle chain, Shi Miao Dao 十秒到, whose name roughly translates to ""ready in ten seconds"" (hence the English name of this restaurant). Specializing in cross-bridge noodles, each set is comprised of a bowl of hot soup, rice noodles, and various accompanying ingredients such as thinly sliced meats, fried tofu puffs, wood-ear mushrooms, pickled cabbage, corn, and more.My sister and I came here on an early Tuesday evening, to get away from the cold, and there were plenty of tables available; no wait was necessary. We ordered the Chicken Leg with Mixed Mushroom Rice Noodles for her, the Beef Brisket Rice Noodles with Tomato Soup for me, and a soft-boiled egg and a side of pig intestines to share. Our server asked if it was okay to pre-mix everything (instead of serving each ingredient individually), which we were fine with, and the food arrived at the table in a matter of minutes and extremely hot too. I swear I burned the roof of my mouth, and my gums too, just trying to slurp up some noodles--yes, a very wise decision, I know--but it was worth it (and well... also because spitting it out in public would've been rude). Both broths were extremely rich and flavorful, but I am partial to the tomato; the tenderness of the beef brisket was amazing and I especially loved the tomatoeyness of the broth. My sister enjoyed her order too, though the staff completely forgot and left out her chicken leg until she asked about it.Overall, great experience here! The food was delicious and the staff were very patient and pleasant to interact with. Will definitely be back to try some of the other menu items or maybe just to order another bowl of tomato beef brisket rice noodles :D"

I decided to go with a bit of spice. On my 1st time this week, I got the kimchee beef slices one and I was very impressed, full of flavor and the portion sizes, amazing. The bowls are actually gigantic and not the ones with a dome in the center. The staff lady was very nice and sweet. And then on Wednesday, the service wasn't as good, I'd say. It felt like the staff were purposely not making eye contact with us or something? And would walk away before we finished our sentences. But on this 2nd time I ordered the pepper sliced beef. So amazing! It was again so flavorful that the dismissive service didn't really phase us much."

I ordered the original beef brisket rice noodle and it was served in a cast iron bowl within a heat resistant container. The noodle soup was really hot and maintained the heat for a good amount of time. The pro was that it was hot and the con was that it was HOT! Took a while to eat.The wait staff was really friendly and attentive. The restaurant was nice, well lit and clean! The bathrooms were also very well maintained. I would definitely go back!

Similarly, I thought the benedict wasn't very impressive either. The hollandaise sauce was creamy and good. My sister said that the coffee tasted bad. There was the tiniest side of toasted potatoes and fresh salad. Overall, the dishes were appropriately priced but there was nothing to write home about and was left a bit disappointed.

I wasn't expecting much--typical Mediterranean-esque wine bar food for basic people named Tiffany whose favorite ""ethnic"" cuisine is Italian.I was flabbergasted. The food here was so, so much better than I could've imagined, and so much better than any other wine bar I've tried in the city. We shared the Beet Salad, Grilled Octopus Salad and Salmon Fettuccine. Good lord. First, the two salads were humongous and filled with the fresh salad veggies we all need to, like, be healthy and go #2 and stuff. But also, they were so effing tasty. Lightly dressed, tangy and springy, and in the case of the Octopus, accompanied by delicious roasted vegetables. The Salmon Fettucine brought a creamy tomato sauce as its date, and between the thick, chewy noodles, generous chunks of salmon, and aforementioned sauce, it was an experience in pasta heaven. I still have yet to find my ultimate pasta restaurant, but this dish is going on my top 20 list.Service was fun and easy, as we sat at their very long, very lovely bar. It's almost criminal that there weren't more people here on a Monday night, but also, the quiet makes it so easy to dine solo or enjoy an intimate conversation."

It's quite similar to the hong kong style teas you get from the chinese bakeries, but stronger and sweeter. They also have a small section of authentic savory foods, like their samosas and curry chicken pastries. They're a good quick snack but not too fresh imo. The lady behind serving is always very nice and gave me and my boyfriend a free samosa with our order to try out, and would round down on our total price when we bought cookies. Try their tea!!"
2688,ShG8hnb4JzNZqESQGTGmCw,9/27/2017,1 star rating,"This place is so disgusting. I used to come here for the occasional samosa, but now I can barely walk past this place without gagging! For MONTHS the outside of this place has been a sticky, garbage juice filled mess. They need to either wash out their garbage cans, double bag their trash, invest in better garbage bags, or, you know, give a damn about the cleanliness of their store. Every day that they put their trash out, it oozes out a gross liquid that puddles and collects in the ADA ramp. So now anyone with a wheelchair, stroller, cart, bad knee, etc who needs to use the ramp has to either find another way to cross the street or roll through that nasty mess. Plus all the people who live  in the area are greeted by that disgusting sight to and from work and school everyday. The front of this store NEVER gets cleaned. You can see months of garbage liquid stains on the sidewalk where one of their workers dragged bags full of garbage out of the store. As the days progresses, the sidewalk just turns into a sticky mess as the occasional person who steps in it walks along the street. It also reeks in the middle of the day when the sun is hot. If you look at nearby stores like Key Food and Sunset Bagels, on mornings they have someone cleaning up the trash outside and on occasion, throwing some disinfectant on the sidewalk and spraying it down when it gets filthy. Not Kabir's, though. They are content to create and carry on in the filthy mess. I cannot believe that a food establishment would keep the outside of their store in this state. I will be filing a complaint with the Department of Sanitation about this place. Legally, you are responsible for keeping the sidewalk in front of your building and 18 inches past the curb clean. This is unacceptable."

Our server was very friendly and accommodating about our special requests, eg we wanted to enjoy the sake warm in a more traditional way, and they don't usually did that, so we asked for it to be given in a bowl of hot water and they were able to make it happen! We got the mystic falls sake ($24 for ""4 shots"") which i enjoyed. The shared plates arrived first--the yakitori skewers ($16) and the spicy salmon tartare ($18, my favorite dish, not very spicy at all). Everyone seemed to enjoy these most out of what we tried. Then the sushi arrived all together; we tried the smoky dragon ($17), spicy mang ($11), and sweet Tree ($11) with the spicy mang being my personal favorite. The roe and caviar are also magically delicious and similar to the actual thing, so I'd give it a try! The portion sizes were smaller than expected, and we still had room for more, so we got the ginger beef dumplings ($11) and the glazed meatballs ($19). The meatballs were on the sweeter side but came with plenty of rice so it filled us up. The dumplings (5) were soft and well seasoned, so also a favorite. Overall it was a delicious meal where we got to try a huge variety of creative and beautiful vegan dishes! Great service and a classy/casual restaurant environment."

We tried the mighty mushroom roll (good but mushrooms lacked complexity), smoked mushroom bao (bao was too doughy, mushrooms were ok), spicy mango roll (good), spicy jackfruit crab, spicy salmon, and salmon tartare.

The soup was thick and took me back to Asia. It is similar to a ramen with noodles and meal-maker that complimented the soup like a chicken.Cant start about the sushi.

I absolutely disliked the oyster mushroom bap, it gave very meaty texture and flavor/ smell. Really was not a fan we didnt eat it! Avocado cookie was definitely not the right texture of a cookie, i think they should call it a avocado matcha cake because it literally tasted like carrot cake and vanilla ice cream. Was delicious but i just dont think it can be labeled as a cookie!Will def return to try other options :) BTW the staff is incredibly nice!!"

The bar was semi full, but nothing overwhelming, and it still took 10-15 minutes each time I needed something. After I got my food I couldn't get the waitress's attention so I had to ask the patron next to me to pass the ketchup. This isn't a big deal but the patron seemed to be in a nice conversation and I interrupted her to get ketchup. She didn't mind but that's not the point; I shouldn't have had to do that. Anyways...The staff was nice when you could get their attention, but it was a test of patience to get some attention. It was kind of disappointing that they don't have many local options.   Being in what's supposed to be a ""progressive neighborhood"" you'd think they'd walk the walk, not just talk the talk and support the local economy by carrying more craft brews. The atmosphere was simple, clean, and open so you don't feel crowded. The saving grace here was the burger. I've tried hundreds of burgers and this burger left an impression. I can't pinpoint the herb/root/something that had a bite to it. It was fresh, a little strong, but not overwhelming. Not ginger or fennel or mustard greens; whatever it is, it rocked! I'd come back just for the burger! Awesome. Burger belongs on a wall of fame somewhere."

Usually end up stopping here whenever we find ourselves in Bushwick (one of our goto staples). Great indoor and outdoor seating. Their buffalo wings are so of the best I've had so far in NYC (definitely worth the saucy mess). They also have a great selection of beers - many local (even from down the street KCBC). Just make sure your bathroom door is locked correctly or someone could accidentally walk in.

The fries were thick cut, almost like steak fries, so addictive! We sat in a booth near where there were musicians playing for the evening. With the dim lighting, cozy booth set up, and live music, the ambiance was lovely and had a romantic feel to it. It was a nice way to wrap up the week together. We'll definitely be back!"

The menu leans English pub grub. The deviled eggs were not over done and the micro greens were tasty. I also had the Moules Frites which were a large portion and had rich flavor.

I've been there a few times and am always impressed by how sweet the servers are, some are obviously new but are so pleasant that I don't mind the extra seconds it takes for them to figure out my order. That missing star is a result of their non gluten options. Like you are a taco joint, how is it that I can't get anything but a bowl!??!?!!? for gluten's sake.

2739,yWKEXT7wcYwyDmzJLVh-ag,1/11/2018,3 star rating,"Went to this location a couple of days ago and was extremely disappointed with the service overall. Only giving 3 stars because the food was the only thing promising from my entire experience. The text on the menu was so small it caused a disagreement between the staff and a customer who couldn't see what he was looking for and accused them of false advertisement - don't blame him at all; the lettering was so small even I had trouble seeing the deal he was asking about on the menu, although it was there. They don't sell alcohol like the cantinas advertise they do. The cashier made me feel like she didn't want to help me, there was no music playing so I felt very uneasy even holding a conversation on the phone, and they even closed the restaurant and turned away guests because they were doing some kind of construction. I wanted to order one more stacker and they said ""sorry, we're closed for 2 hours."" They didn't even tell me to leave when they made the decision to do all of this and started playing dembow music - of all genres - super loud after not having anything playing at all the entire time I was having my meal. Ridiculous. The prices were even higher than my favorite Taco Bell location on the UES, which disappointed me even more. Definitely not returning to this establishment, although it is a convenient distance from my home compared to the one on 97th and Lex. I'd rather make my way there than EVER go back to this ""cantina."""

The taste of cinnamony and gooey icing goodness NEVER disappoints! Customer service is hit or miss, but it's a mall spot - manage your expectations. Pricey too! 5 mini-Cinnabons were like $23.

I was curious if they offer 3 pieces instead of 6. The lady at the counter said no, then I asked how much are they because i could not see a price list. Anyways she said $5, so i wanted one pack of 6 to go, the way she acted was not kind. I am usually so humanistic when it comes to understanding people's daily possible modes but she could at least give a fake smile or something.Rolls were not bad, at least warm. Their fork, knife and napkin station is right where you pay."

This guy assisted the person behind me, so you know I was pissed off.    ""Excuse me; may I speak to your manager?""... Listen to the big kicker, the person was the manager!  I have informed him of his actions; he swept it under the rug.  SCREW Cinnabon; I should have went to Godiva instead!"

I was just looking for a decent coffee place. As the other day I went to a coffee place around the area that place was very loud and cold as the door was open.  Tous les Jours is warm and You need to grab what you want and go in the front and order coffee and pay. I love the amazing selection of pastries and drinks. It's was beautifully maintained and clean. They have restroom and charging area in case you want to work or so. Music was great not that loud.

I've come to this location multiple times now and never had a single issue with staff, cleanliness, or food. The staff was really considerate and very courteous and all around lovely. As for food, there's so much to choose from whether it be savory or sweet and is generally extremely affordable. There's something for everyone and at a fair price point if you're looking to watch your spending. There's cakes, breads, croissants, croquettes, sandwiches, etc. The food isn't out of this world or anything but it's great for a quick pick me up or snack. If you want to make lunch out of it (as I did every time I came) try a bunch of different items. You can easily get up to five items (depending on what you purchase) for ten bucks."

2754,rGjcrXMlp_i-DJVOObtV5A,10/9/2021,5 star rating,"The green tea matcha cake is delicious from Tous Les Jours. They have two sizes of cakes in the $30-$45 range  serving 6 to 8. The cake does not have a heavy layer of cream and a strong matcha flavor. The strawberry cake is also a good choice, very airy like a sponge cake. The taro ube bread is dark purple in color but it does it have a strong ube flavor. I tried the matcha milk bread and it was disappointingly bitter and drier than usual. I recommend the croquettes filled with kimchi, curry, or red bean."

Good lord... why.. why.. must there be something so good..WHY! The bread is air light,  soft and mouth watering, delicious! Just take a look at my pictures. Make sure you have tissue near by to catch the drool. There's more.  The coffee (I had an americano) actually tastes like, just picked off the branches and brewed just for me yummy!They have cakes and cookies.  I'll update when I try them.Sidebar: They offer healthy sandwiches and small salads as well."

2761,EzMdq_Hhx034EAmgYTpRYQ,3/30/2023,2 star rating,"The smaller pastries are a hit or miss; sometimes fresh, sometimes stale. I don't recommend the cakes because I bought one for my friend's birthday and it was evidently made a week or so ago. The surface of the cake was a hard layer of dusted cocoa powder and frosting while the inside cake was dense, not fluffy. It's a shame that they don't have better protocols set in place for when to dispose of their items to keep a fresh consistency throughout the store. It doesn't surprise me though because their profit margins are probably more important than customer satisfaction. Maybe others know this, so their cakes usually sit inside the glass longer than usual, who knows. I recommend taking a trip to The French Workshop, their cakes are about the same price ($40), but you will get a much more delicious, fresh, and detail-oriented cake. Also, The French Workshop bakes on the premises fresh everyday."

Once in a while, I get a staff that speaks & understands English. But, most of the time, they only speak Mandarin. If I'm just buying pastries/bread, checking out is not a problem.

I sipped from the cup and instead of dumping the liquid and remaking the drink using a new cup, the barista rinsed my paper cup and remade the milk tea in the same cup which would have been fine if she hadn't then placed the cup underneath the frothing wand to heat the milk. Who knows how many people drink from a cup and then get their drink heated in this manner? A food establishment needs to follow the most hygienic practices and they don't seem to be following the appropriate measures.

There's time to get the ingredients right, and even if not, I already paid which means they should have confirmed it already. Then they couldn't even refund the debit card I used which they said they could, after putting me on hold for a long time.

It was raining today, they even refused to double bag the cake. The old guy looks like the owner said that the bag was imported and costs $2 each. 2 dollars for a regular plastic bag?? That was ridiculous. They not only need to learn how to make a cake but also how to treat customers right. Will not come back!蛋糕死甜，中间蛋糕的实体都是干干的一点也不新鲜。从冰箱一拿出来奶油也快融化了。一打开里面蛋糕都是歪的。我一直是平着拿回家的。蛋糕味道不对服务态度也极差。一个猥琐样子的中年男子在前台看着像店长或者老板。外面下雨今天要求他多包一层袋子也拒绝。说是进口袋子一个两块。只是一个普通透明的塑料袋而已。太恶心了！这店不仅要学做蛋糕还要学学怎么对待客户。这家不做回头客了。呸"

I was just looking for a decent coffee place. As the other day I went to a coffee place around the area that place was very loud and cold as the door was open.  Tous les Jours is warm and You need to grab what you want and go in the front and order coffee and pay. I love the amazing selection of pastries and drinks. It's was beautifully maintained and clean. They have restroom and charging area in case you want to work or so. Music was great not that loud.

I've come to this location multiple times now and never had a single issue with staff, cleanliness, or food. The staff was really considerate and very courteous and all around lovely. As for food, there's so much to choose from whether it be savory or sweet and is generally extremely affordable. There's something for everyone and at a fair price point if you're looking to watch your spending. There's cakes, breads, croissants, croquettes, sandwiches, etc. The food isn't out of this world or anything but it's great for a quick pick me up or snack. If you want to make lunch out of it (as I did every time I came) try a bunch of different items. You can easily get up to five items (depending on what you purchase) for ten bucks."

The cake does not have a heavy layer of cream and a strong matcha flavor. The strawberry cake is also a good choice, very airy like a sponge cake. The taro ube bread is dark purple in color but it does it have a strong ube flavor. I tried the matcha milk bread and it was disappointingly bitter and drier than usual. I recommend the croquettes filled with kimchi, curry, or red bean."

Good lord... why.. why.. must there be something so good..WHY! The bread is air light,  soft and mouth watering, delicious! Just take a look at my pictures. Make sure you have tissue near by to catch the drool. There's more.  The coffee (I had an americano) actually tastes like, just picked off the branches and brewed just for me yummy!They have cakes and cookies.  I'll update when I try them.Sidebar: They offer healthy sandwiches and small salads as well."

2781,EzMdq_Hhx034EAmgYTpRYQ,3/30/2023,2 star rating,"The smaller pastries are a hit or miss; sometimes fresh, sometimes stale. I don't recommend the cakes because I bought one for my friend's birthday and it was evidently made a week or so ago. The surface of the cake was a hard layer of dusted cocoa powder and frosting while the inside cake was dense, not fluffy. It's a shame that they don't have better protocols set in place for when to dispose of their items to keep a fresh consistency throughout the store. It doesn't surprise me though because their profit margins are probably more important than customer satisfaction. Maybe others know this, so their cakes usually sit inside the glass longer than usual, who knows. I recommend taking a trip to The French Workshop, their cakes are about the same price ($40), but you will get a much more delicious, fresh, and detail-oriented cake. Also, The French Workshop bakes on the premises fresh everyday."

Two other groups at the small tables were just having drinks. We asked them if they had ordered food or had been asked to order food and they said no. Coincidentally these groups were all men who were not inconvenient or asked to move. We understand if this is a restaurant policy but it should be applied to everybody equally.

Another 25 minutes before our food arrived. My fiancé's breakfast burrito was missing the bacon she requested. As for my eggs Benedict, the poached eggs were cooked. Yep...soft boiled instead of runny yokes. Couldn't decide exactly what the ham was - maybe it was smoked Black Forest (odd choice.) It looked like a school lunchroom mystery meat. The presentation on all 3 plates looked like something a well meaning middle schooler put together for Mother's Day. Just a really off, weird dining experience.As compensation they didn't charge us for the eggs Benedict. OK, that was gracious, but I was really flabbergasted. Such simple entree's & they totally flubbed. But I'm gonna presume it was just a bad day & will give them another chance. In a few months - it's not like we lack for options."

I walked in unsure what I wanted and needed some time to peruse the menu. The guys behind the counter didn't rush me (no line at 2pm anyway) and I asked a few questions before making my choice.The decision was The Cold Cut Sammy or the Italian BMT. The latter was the better choice since I'm a fan of pepperoni. They even toasted it for me and carefully placed all of my toppings - neatly and as requested. Like that they are reasonably priced and they offer value meal options. Maybe next time I'll get a cookie... Forgot they even sell those!

But I'm pretty sure that was because they were fried and put directly into the container. The problem was it didn't seem like the pizza's sauce had much seasoning at all. It was bland. Just disappointing. I added extra garlic and parmesan to the knots as well. Good service. Just disappointed with the  taste."

2820,9KcCBiz0vnchA-m02bJHtA,3/3/2023,3 star rating,"I recently visited Rocco's Pizza in New York and had a mixed experience. While the White Cheese Spinach pizza was quite tasty, the Grandmother's pizza left a lot to be desired. It was quite disappointing and I didn't enjoy it at all. Additionally, I was disappointed to find that the pizzas I received were quite cold, even though they had supposedly been heated. This made it difficult to really enjoy the flavors and textures of the pizza. In addition to the cold pizzas and mixed quality of the food, it's a shame to hear that the service at Rocco's Pizza was lacking. It's always disappointing when staff members are dismissive, as it can really affect the overall experience. I would suggest that Rocco's Pizza consider providing more training to their employees on customer service and how to interact with customers in a positive and welcoming way. This could go a long way toward improving the overall dining experience for customers,. Overall, I would rate my experience at Rocco's Pizza as 3 out of 5 stars. While there were some things that were good, there were definitely some areas for improvement as well."

Just like all XFF locations, you order at the front and can either take your food to-go or try to find a spot to sit in the restaurant. While there were a couple seats by the bar, I appreciated that this location had multiple tables in the back room, so it was easy for my friends and I to find a table to eat for lunch. Sadly my spice tolerance isn't great, but I love their cold-skin noodles (liang pi, A1) if I want something more refreshing or their pork ""zha jiang"" hand-ripped noodles for something more filling. I would definitely recommend getting the noodles spicy though if you are able to- that's how it's recommended by the chef himself!

So first and foremost this is true middle eastern/Persian family cuisine, meaning one plate can feed two or more and the food is meant for sharing. So while 20+ a plate it's really 20+ for two. They have all of the classic Persian dishes and everything we had was so good. Fovorite was the minced chicken kabob, then lamb kabob, next the dark meat which had this wonderful spice explosion and heat to it and then the other chicken and lastly the stew. The stew was really good so it's not last because it was gross, it's last because everything is amazing. The stew was like a goulash or maybe goulash is like their stew. I dunno. The minced chicken kabob is next level tasty, I can't describe how good it was. Then I had the tehrani mule and it was pretty good too. The desserts were a chocolate mousse which was thick and chocolatey with cinnamon after taste and then the chocolate and saffron vanilla gelato covered with chocolate shell and a cherry center.

2864,ExvoimQ4LzY3UWtZ6m6Lgw,12/22/2022,5 star rating,"TLDR: Ravagh is an excellent choice for Persian food conveniently close to the Empire State Building. Fresh, savory and oh so tasty. My personal favorites are the Chicken Koobideh and Dark Meat Chicken. Both the Kashk-Bademjan and Babaganoosh are awesome for appetizers.Ravagh is a chain of Persian eateries with locations in Manhattan and Long Island. Kebobs are the main draw here but don't sleep on the dips. If you come during lunch time, you can opt for a complimentary salad or soup. Both are good choices, just depends on what you're craving.The Kashk-Bademjan is a dip of eggplant simmered in tomatoes with a nice dollop of yogurt on top. Use the hot crusty bread to scoop up every bit of it. If you want something a bit cooler, the Babaganoosh is rich, garlicky and delightfully smoky.I've had most of the kebobs. If you're not sure what to get for two, just get the combination. For $62 you'll get a massive tray of rice with really tender chicken, steak and ground beef. Personally, I like the chicken koobideh and the dark meat chicken. The chicken koobideh is juicy, saffron rich and goes perfect with the grilled onions/tomato you get. The dark meat chicken is a kebob of marinated chicken thighs, some spice and also delicious. If you want one of each - order the Chicken Sultani.There was a point I was coming here weekly. It's relatively healthy, satisfying and honestly a solid deal for a sit-down lunch in this area. If you're trying to avoid lots of carbs, swap your rice for grilled veggies."

2870,bG68AUaOLsxqWKZ1iN-Ikg,4/30/2019,4 star rating,Their rice is gold. Omg the flavor of their rice and beans with chicken and chicken stew sauce with some softened fried Maduros just hits the spot. Without a word we just kept eating the slightly tomato flavored rice with the chargrilled chicken parts. Right next to papis- this place has even more options and obviously know a thing or two about Hispanic comfort food.

2872,bG68AUaOLsxqWKZ1iN-Ikg,8/22/2018,4 star rating,"I'm hesitant to write this review because this little shop is my neighborhood gem, but we love Bridge Coffee Shop and it's time to share.As you may have seen through photos and pics, Bridge Coffee Shop is not really a coffee shop. Sure, they serve coffee, but it's more of a breakfast/brunch/lunch diner. They've got a full menu of diner-breakfasty items such as pancakes, eggs, omelets, etc... but they also have a large display case of ready-made Spanish foods that are always delicious.Prices are quite low for the neighborhood, and the food is always great. My wife and I come a few times a month, usually for a late breakfast on Saturdays and walk out full with a bill of less than $20. We usually get a couple of lunch plates when we go, which consists of rice, beans and a meat of some sort. The roasted pork is excellent and juicy, the chicken legs are huge and come with flavorful thighs, the chicken and beef stews are also quite flavorful and loaded with gravy. I've had their broiled salmon and each fillet is massive in size, juicy, and cooked well for a joint that doesn't specialize in seafood.My only gripe is that, being a diner with its roots in Spanish cuisine, it's pretty tough to get something green here. Most days they will have a small tub of steamed veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, corn) but that's it. Looking for a salad? Go someplace else.This joint is a hold out from when the neighborhood used to be industrial, but with more and more DUMBO/Vinegar hill luxury condos and apartments coming every day, I'm hoping this place will be able to maintain their spot on the corner. Hopefully they own their building.Pro Tip: Closed on Sundays."
2873,bG68AUaOLsxqWKZ1iN-Ikg,11/24/2020,4 star rating,"This place has great tasting food. Prices are great, But unfortunately whenever you make an order they forget to put syrup with French toast or they don't put salt on the grits when you have asked for that specifically. They are so fast to rush you off of the phone that the orders are messed up."
2874,bG68AUaOLsxqWKZ1iN-Ikg,11/1/2018,3 star rating,"The food is good for a quick bite, but my only issue is that they have decided to raise their prices. Failing to notify the customers and merely just starting charging the new increase and when questioned the simply say price went up. I get it prices do go up but to raises them and not tell anyone is shameful on their behalf"
2875,bG68AUaOLsxqWKZ1iN-Ikg,5/23/2015,5 star rating,"Latino food tucked away in a quiet side of DUMBO. What a delight. I was delighted to have entered into the  restaurant and getting hit with the delicious smell of Latino comfort food. It seemed like a far cry from the gentrifying neighborhood just a couple of blocks away. Try the rice with beef!  And top it off with a beef empanada. Suck it down with coffee. I shall be back.Oh, I forgot to tell the staff to not change their style of coffee. They have coffee that tastes more Latino-ish, not like the gentrified style around the neighborhood. Tastes lighter and better. Just my two cents."

I originally went in for coffee, but after seeing their delicious food I totally forgot about coffee. I went during lunch and ordered yellow rice with red beans and beef. The beef was sooo tender and it was served with potatoes and carrots in a gravy. The yellow rice was very good! I also got a chicken empanadas which pretty good as well. Totally didn't expect such good food walking in. My total was 10 bucks with a 32 oz Gatorade."

I have tried a variety of their kimbaps, but my favorite dishes are the kimchi and tuna kimbap and their seafood/janchi noodle soup (잔치국수). When I'm feeling fancy, I sometimes go for the lobstar kimbap.The food has good portions, tastes and looks great, and it always satisfies my cravings. I'll be continuing to order from here!"

Everything you want from a kimbap meal. Do I need to say more? Many places in the city will overcharge you for a staple such as kimbap but this place doesn't have that problem and of course, no skimping on the flavor either.TTEOKBEOKKISpicy! I can handle spice pretty well (half of Thai, most Korean food) but this was definitely on the hotter end of tteokbeokki I've had. But it was stuffed with goodies - my favorite part was the fish cake that it came with. Everything was really good, the rice  cake was soft and chewy and oh so satisfying. Looking for a quick pick me up with korean staples? No need to dine out, just pick up some stuff from here."

I've been coming here since high school and the quality of food hasn't changed whatsoever over the past decade.If you're not super hungry, opt for the cup-bap or the rice balls. If you come with a friend, get the couple set it's definitely worth.Easily one of the best kimbap spots in all of NYC."

However, I can only say that for the kimbap. We ordered the couple set (which came with Spicy rice cake, pork cutlet, and kimbap), and a crab salad rice ball. Everything tasted pretty mediocre, and I would most likely not crave the food here. I would give Rolly Kimbab a 3.5 if I could sole because of the generous portion size."

I recently had an immense craving for kimbap as it's been a few months since I last had it, and so my partner decided to satisfy my craving. The two of us arrived at Rolly one early Monday morning and dined in. When we walked in, we were promptly guided to a table and given menus and cold cups of water. We ordered their rolly kimbab, spicy bulgogi kimbab, and bulgogi cup bab, and it came with some banchan (Korean pickled radish, radish kimchi, and macaroni salad) and two bowls of miso soup. While the rice was slightly colder and a tad drier than I remembered, everything was really tasty, and more importantly, the entire meal was filling. The service was quick and friendly too. Highly recommend."

I came to this Auburndale location about a handful of times recently and always get their rice balls. Either spicy tuna, bulgogi and/or spam. They make it perfect every time, the spicy tuna is so flavorful and also my favorite. I can literally eat it everyday for breakfast, lunch or dinner, which I've done before. They open at 7am and everything is made to order, super quick plus it's cheap too! $5 for a rice ball & soup."

It's like 20% rice and 80% filling.Super generous portions and reasonable prices. I wish we had options like this in Brooklyn. The kimbab is like somewhat a cheat meal, but not really? I usually destroy two rolls and feel perfectly satisfied and not stuffed afterwards.The spicy tuna is a must everytime I'm here. Bugolgi and spicy squid is pretty good too."

Over 150+ menu items to choose from! (44 of them being kimbap WOW!)We ordered:Pork cutlet kimbap ($6.50)Spicy tuna kimbap ($6.50)Vegetarian kimbap ($6)Mushroom kimbap ($6)I always get spicy tuna kimbap so I can more accurately compare different kimbap places. No arguments here, their kimbap is so delicious and packed with many ingredients. The pork cutlet one was surprisingly so good and this is coming from someone who is not a fan of pork!  The vegetarian is pretty refreshing, you taste the pickled radish very clearly!Their options for kimbap is endless, seriously, whatever ingredient you're a fan of, you can find it here! How do you resist trying all their different kimbap combos?! Guess I'll just get fat off kimbap :) Cant wait to come and try the other items on their menu. The cup-bab in particular is so intriguing!"

The Counterman tells her that it will be a ""couple of minutes"". The further agitated driver asks for a clarification ""how many minutes? 2... 3..."" and the Counterman states loudly ""A couple of minutes means TWO!"". The driver protests ""A couple of minutes can mean a few.. 2, 3, 4..6..."" she drops the futile argument as the Counterman attends to counter business. I laugh to myself. What does this have to do with anything? Probably not much, I just love the confusion the statement ""a couple of minutes"" causes (I side with the Counterman - a couple literally means two).Anyway.. this place serves over 40 kinds of kimbab among other casual Korean foods. I had the Rolly and Spicy Squid kimbabs. They are cheap, delicious and filling. They come with soup. What's not to like? - a meal and a show!"

Definitely not the best for their bread since it is very competitive in 8 Avenue the mini Chinatown.What is good and has me coming back is their Chestnut birthday cake. As for Chinese cream cakes the chestnut flavor is my favorite and in ""Best Bakery"" they make it very fresh and I can't find any other bakery with the same taste, not even Dragon Bay Bakery, the more popular chain bakery in this community. From childhood until my late teen years I have been getting their cakes. The smallest size is 6"" I believe and also order in advance for it to be freshly made. Also making it into a certain shape will be charged extra. Personally I do not like anything else from here other than their cakes. They are just like any other bakery but with not as much choices and they do have cakes too but the times I have gotten it wasn't as impressive as the preorder cakes."

They have an employee stationed by the baked goods table to help customers select their desired goods and get them with their purchases to the cash register. That way, customers aren't handling the tongs, trays, or potentially other pastries. First time seeing this system- most other bakeries I've been to have used individual wrappers instead now. I got the coconut topped bun filled with sweet whipped butter, and a honeydew pearl drink. I think the woman misheard or misunderstood my drink order, I mean, can anyone understand anyone in a mask? Anyways, I ended up with a cantaloupe ice drink, but MAN it was 10x better than boba! The slush on a hot day like today really did the trick! And the coconut bun was a solid standard. Best bakery? I mean, I can't say it's the very best yet, but definitely up there!"

My favorites are the hot dog buns and custard buns, which are not too salty/sweet like some other bakeries. The coconut tart is also flavorful and crispy. On a hot day, you can stop by for a shake or ice tea or soy milk. There is seating for about 10 people at a time, which usually isn't filled up as people tend to grab and go.If you have a special occasion, you can also order specialty cakes or grab one of the pre-made birthday ones.

What I love from this bakery are the raisin sponge cakes...they are soft as cloud and not too sweet. Will definitely come back to try more of what they have to offer."

The first lady rudely took my order then later  tossed my food to me and told me to take it to the counter to pay. At the counter I was ignored and the cashier took orders from other people and not me. (Lines exist for a reason) When I finally flagged down her attention for me to pay she rudely ask ""what do you want?"" like I am taking up all the time in her world.  I gave her a 20 dollar bill and she gave me my change all in 1s. When I ask for the 1s to be in 5s she told me she don't got. I saw there was a stack of 5s in there. So feeling frustrated I just ended up having 15 one's stuffed Into my wallet.The food itself is priced within the dollar or less range like most bakery so there's not much difference there. Taste is also plain just like every bakery. Every successful bakery with polite employees I been to, it's always full of elders sitting and chatting away with their friends over a cup of drink but here is like a desert. Whoever is the owner or manager please do work on customer service skills. Since 8 th ave is an avenue full of bakeries and other restaurants, I will not return to this one nor would I ever recommend this place to anyone.

Loved this spot, they are located by the train station in fact they are under the 7 line train track.Very spacious restaurant and they totally abide by the COVID safety measures. They check your temperature before you enter the restaurant, then you'd need to put your name and contact information on this list in case of an emergency and finally they have this gigantic sanitizer liquid jar where you can wash off all those germs before finally making it into the restaurant.I usually like to sit on the second floor where they have a cool orange tree, it's not real. I liked how the waiters and waitresses dressed in white and red, that's the restaurant's theme colors.I've always ordered their breaded chicken cutlet with fries and a side of yellow rice. Omg, they served a lot of food. This time around I'd also ordered their sangria, which was tasty and delicious. My friend and I had about 2 1/2 glasses each in case you are ordering a sangria pitcher. And we ended the night having flan for dessert. It's so sweet! They have many more delicious options on the menu. This place is super family oriented if you are thinking of having a family outing. Overall great place!"

Huge variety of traditional dishes, from seafood to classics like bandeja paisa, we ordered the bandeja Mario which was basically a sampler platter with different varieties of meats and sides and also the beef tongue in criolla sauce. Both dishes were generous and tasted great. This location is decorated like a the traditional Fonda paisa with classical colonial architecture, it was nice to be seated inside and felt like in a Colombian finca patio, service was great and our food came out fast.

I order a dish that two or three people can eat and it is a combination of steak, chicken and pork. Also included are fries, plantains, yellow rice and beans and avocado. There is no need to season any of the meats because they are so perfectly seasoned and cooked. All you need to do is cut and pop in your mouth and it's heaven. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant. LASTLY, it is so inexpensive!!!!"

I liked how the waiters and waitresses dressed in white and red, that's the restaurant's theme colors.I've always ordered their breaded chicken cutlet with fries and a side of yellow rice. Omg, they served a lot of food. This time around I'd also ordered their sangria, which was tasty and delicious. My friend and I had about 2 1/2 glasses each in case you are ordering a sangria pitcher. And we ended the night having flan for dessert. It's so sweet!

Now that the hours have scaled back significantly (#1) it has become a regular establishment that just happens to be located on a super popular corner of 81st & Roosevelt.The interiors are eerily reminiscent of La Pollera de Mario in Sunnyside (#2), which also has similar menu design and other aspects of the business, which I'd conclude is under the same ownership. While it's usually cramped and crowded day and night, they have a second level to alleviate some of the space issues. Group dining here can be a challenge, but not a total bust.From a food perspective, I think their meats are the way to go. The bandeja paisa is always a hearty option, even if much of the plate is usually dry / overcooked. I feel similarly about the parrillada platters, but whatever you do, make sure they have skirt steak as a part of it. The beans and rice can be tasty, but I'd recommend asking for the egg to be over easy for the egg yolk alone. I'd skip on the pollo a la brasa, even if it's part of the namesake of this place. Parking is going to be frustrating for anyone driving in, so I'd suggest the 7 train whenever possible (#3). It is located just steps away from the 82nd street station and is easy to get to on foot from any of the nearby stations. They could probably use an extra body or two on the staffing front as sometimes service is a bit of an afterthought.______________(#1) They now close at 10pm, or even slightly earlier.(#2) yelp.com/biz/la-pollera-…(#3) I realize this isn't a recommendation."

Huge variety of traditional dishes, from seafood to classics like bandeja paisa, we ordered the bandeja Mario which was basically a sampler platter with different varieties of meats and sides and also the beef tongue in criolla sauce. Both dishes were generous and tasted great. This location is decorated like a the traditional Fonda paisa with classical colonial architecture, it was nice to be seated inside and felt like in a Colombian finca patio, service was great and our food came out fast. Would recommend and will definitely come back to try other dishes."

I order a dish that two or three people can eat and it is a combination of steak, chicken and pork. Also included are fries, plantains, yellow rice and beans and avocado. There is no need to season any of the meats because they are so perfectly seasoned and cooked. All you need to do is cut and pop in your mouth and it's heaven. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant.

Loved this spot, they are located by the train station in fact they are under the 7 line train track.Very spacious restaurant and they totally abide by the COVID safety measures. They check your temperature before you enter the restaurant, then you'd need to put your name and contact information on this list in case of an emergency and finally they have this gigantic sanitizer liquid jar where you can wash off all those germs before finally making it into the restaurant.I usually like to sit on the second floor where they have a cool orange tree, it's not real. I liked how the waiters and waitresses dressed in white and red, that's the restaurant's theme colors.I've always ordered their breaded chicken cutlet with fries and a side of yellow rice. Omg, they served a lot of food. This time around I'd also ordered their sangria, which was tasty and delicious. My friend and I had about 2 1/2 glasses each in case you are ordering a sangria pitcher. And we ended the night having flan for dessert. It's so sweet! They have many more delicious options on the menu. This place is super family oriented if you are thinking of having a family outing. Overall great place!"

The fries were fried so hard she couldn't eat them now idk if they have a new cook but this is very surprising. I asked if they would recommend the veggie wrap I decided to try something  different and I won't be getting it again it's filled with some kind of sauce and I would just stick to my burger personally. Also my fries were very hard not sure if they were having an off day however we feel as if we wasted money today. Very disappointed! I've come to this location maybe 4xs already and my mother loves the wraps.She gets the southwest wrap with extra avocado she recently asked for the jalapeños to be put on the side since sometimes it can be overwhelming. The wrap is a good size and comes with fries, onion rings or sweet potato fries. I do believe there is an up charge for sweet potato fries. I have ordered the salmon burger deluxe numerous times it also comes with fries, onion rings or sweet potato fries. It is a great size and the burger is always soft, moist and tasty. I usually add cheese if you do not specifically tell them what kind they give you American but they do offer a few other choices. I've also ordered chicken fingers and fries and for the cost it's a great amount of food. The children's portions seem to be the same as the adults honestly not a bad thing at all I ordered a chicken quesadilla and it was burnt and they put onions and peppers inside which is not the way my mother prefers it so she wouldn't order it again.Every time I I call to place an order they are very nice take the order well and I haven't had an issues. They always ask if you would like to add a drink before they hang up which to me is great customer service!"

Both the food and customer service have been the most terrible I've ever received. Ordered lemon ricotta pancakes and received plain pancakes stuffed with sour ricotta. Nothing about these even resemble what a lemon ricotta pancake should look like, let alone taste like. When I called the restaurant for an explanation I was told by the young woman answering that ""She's never tried them but that's just the way we make it"" and later on proceeded to talk trash about me in Spanish to what I assume is her manager and then hung up the phone on me. When I called back the older woman who again I assume to be the manager said ""Well no one else has complained about them so ..."" and proceeded to tell me to just leave a review. So here I am; leaving a review. Do not support this business; go literally anywhere else. I assure you that your local bodega man makes a better pancake and has a hell of a better attitude."

They also got some of the substitutions wrong. When I received the order I called to let them know the person on the phone was so rude to me. Instead of taking any fault for mishearing what I said or placing the order wrong, (which honestly wasn't me and I have three people here that heard me order) I got yelled at basically and was told I was the one at fault.

How can a restaurant decide to change the definition of what poached eggs are supposed to be???? She proceeds to tell me that she will refund the eggs Benedict but not the omelette. I explained to her that it was basically burned and she claimed that it wasn't burned when it left the restaurant. I guess the delivery driver must have stopped at his house and continued to cook the omelette. It's crazy to think that in these times there are restaurants that are going above and beyond to provide quality food while some are doing a terrible job! Almost forgot to say she put me on hold and then hung up on me. Terrible food and terrible service! Beware!!!"

As someone fond of both Japanese and Jewish food, I was curious how this fusion would be and their take is creative and tasty. The pace of the meal wasn't rushed which allowed the diner to enjoy each course. Challah- $7- paying $7 for a challah bun is a lot but it was good, especially with the accompanying golden raisin butter. The bread itself is a little dry without it. Okonomiyaki- $19- this was very delicious! The pancake was made with sauerkraut and to be honest I couldn't taste the tang of it but it was still great. Crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside. There were small pieces of pastrami on top and bonito flakes. I was worried ordering two dishes with pastrami would be too much but it wasn't because there wasn't a lot on this one. Caesar salad- $17- this was surprisingly super memorable! The portion was very large and the Caesar dressing had citrus as a prominent flavor, lemon I believe. There were anchovies on top, but not the ordinary kind, white ones which are better. Matzo ball ramen- $19- I like how it's possible to share the ramen at Shalom Japan. They bring out small bowls so you can divvy it up. I recommend adding an extra matzo ball, especially if you're sharing. It's a few dollars extra. The soup had carrot and celery in it, reminiscent of matzo ball soup, but also scallion and ramen noodles like a typical bowl of ramen. There were crunchy crouton like bits that added nice crunch. I will say I wasn't that impressed with the chicken char siu but I think what they were doing was pretty cool! Pastrami sando- $22- the pastrami was very good but what really stood out was the bread. It was definitely homemade. Not your typical rye, but a milk bread version. It was fluffy and soft. The price seemed a bit high considering the amount of pastrami wasn't as much as other places but the other places also don't serve homemade bread. I loved my experience at Shalom Japan! I recommend you visit and try it for yourself. I'm"

The space is overall on the louder side and you are seated very close to others. We started with challah which was delicious with the butter. We then split the matzah ball rame and the mazemen. The matzah ball ramen was a great combination and very tasty. The mazemen was excellent and I enjoyed it. The service overall was good, we didn't wait too long for our seats or food but nothing too spectacular. I ordered the sweet and sawa cocktail as well which was good. Overall this was a good restaurant with good food and drinks. Worth the visit, I'll probably be back."
72,zJcxZQbTSAP3q4Fy-6WAyw,3/27/2023,3 star rating,"I came to Shalom Japan very excited! I'm Jewish and I love Japanese food, so I thought I had found a new favorite restaurant. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed by the end. I thought the prices were high and the food was pretty mediocre. The thing about fusion cuisine restaurants is that in order for them to work, I think the dishes need to be really well thought out AND well executed. I think the dishes at Shalom Japan had Greta thought behind them, but weren't properly executed. We had the sake kasu challah, beet jew egg, matzoh ball ramen, and lox bowl.The challah was probably the highlight of the meal, which was pretty sad considering it was about the size of a dinner roll and they only give you a dollop of the golden raisin butter. The beet jew egg felt very out of place amongst the rest of the menu/our dishes and although it was decent, we regretted ordering it. My friend did not enjoy the matzoh ball ramen very much. He said it was bland/underwhelming. Next was my lox bowl. I liked this, but I thought it was extremely overpriced for what it was and unfortunately, lox with sushi rice/sushi toppers just isn't as good as sushi grade salmon. Like I said previously, it was a nice idea, but the execution wasn't there.I don't know if I would come back. I think there are better Jewish and Japanese restaurants all over NY, and combining them in a mediocre way isn't necessarily worth a revisit."

We arrived for our 8:30 dinner reservation and had about a half hour/45 min wait which was a bit frustrating but the hostess felt so bad she gave us all free glasses of Prosecco while we waited and gave us the challah with butter for free when we sat down. Totally made our night.I had the vegan mazemen which was DELICIOUS. So unique and creamy, with delicious sesame and umami flavors. My fiancée loved his matzoh ball ramen (how could you really go wrong) and the challah with butter was super yummy and warm. Our friend was a bit ""meh"" about his pastrami sandwich and didn't really see the ""Japanese"" twist on it. The desserts were decent but nothing super special. I'd skip. The restaurant is really small and cramped, which is the only reason I'm knocking a star. They should tell tables they have a strict 90 min dinner time bc people were really just hanging around at their tables for a looooong time after they were done eating. Not sure if I'd come back since it's a bit out of the way, but worth a visit if you haven't been."

It was pouring rain and I was meeting friend and really did not want to go. I was reading reviews that the portion sizes were too small and everything is too expensive. Luckily the really nice staff and delicious food turned my mood around!A lot of my friends were doing family style (they ordered one plate but shared it between a few people) and that really seems like the move here since everything is so tasty. I got the Wagu Pastrami sando and it was great. I was originally worried about the size as it is definitely small, but there was enough meat inside the sando that I was stuffed before I even finished. I put a little golden raisin butter from the challah that we ordered to give the sandwich a bit of sweetness. My boyfriend got the mazto ramen bowel and it was so tasty. They brought over broth spoons about half way through eating. Upon hearing that the food was not filling from other Yelp reviewers, we (along with one of our friends at the dinner) made a pact to go to a famous halal food cart by us after. However, none of us were hungry so we did not want to go. I personally found the food to be a really good size for what it is. I truly think if I had anymore Wagu Pastrami, I'd have left the restaurant with the meat sweats!For birthdays, they will put a candle on a dessert that you order (if you ask).The only reason I'm taking off a star was because there was a weird instance where their menu price did not match what we were charged. My friend and I both ordered the same wine and the menu said one price ($14 or $15, the wine list on their website doesn't work so I can check. I thought it was $15 but my friend insisted it was $14) but we were charged $46 ($15.33 each glass). We didn't bring it up and assumed it was a fluke... but if I went again I'd definitely be checking the bill a little closer."

The broth is really rich but I was disappointed that there was only one piece of chicken and one matzoh ball. To it's credit the matzoh ball was really good and the egg was cooked perfectly. I just wished I had more of it. I also wish the restaurant had been playing music in the background because I felt like it could have heightened the experience.

I've had this restaurant on my list for quite some time and was highly intrigued by the Jewish and Japanese fusion dishes. Unfortunately the food was underwhelming. The portions were small, the prices were high, and the flavor was minimal. I am leaving 3 stars just because of how great our waiter was. He truly deserved 5 stars on his own! The staff brought the dishes quickly and while they were still warm despite it being a full restaurant. I'd also like to mention the restaurant is small and we did not have a reservation. However we were seated quickly in the overflow area that was a covered outside spot with heaters. The heaters were directly above our table which kept us warm. This area was small but we didn't mind it because we had more space than guests dining in the main area. They kept the divider door closed and would only open one half of it for guests and the waiters which was odd because it was a fairly tiny opening that you'd have to almost shimmy through. If you do plan on coming make a reservation. Jew Egg - Although it's appealing I'd recommend skipping it. For $17 I'd expect more. The yogurt dip that came with it was fine but it didn't add much to the dish and lacked tang. I'm not an egg expert but my friend mentioned it lacked the runniness soft boiled eggs typical have. Challah bread and raisin butter - the bread was quite good and came warm. The star of the show in my opinion was the raisin butter. However if this is what you're coming for I'm sure you can find a bakery in the area to serve as an alternative.Wagyu Sando - Skip this. The sandwich was just fatty meat on plain bread. The pickle to me tasted as if someone covered a cucumber in salt to extract the water for a different dish but changed their mind and served it as a pickle. Mazemen - This noodle dish was described to us as broth-less and creamy with an Unami flavor. We opted to not add an egg because we assumed the dish itself was creamy enough and the addition would be an overkill - we were right. While it wasn't the most flavorful item it was just fine and probably the best thing we ate. My friend had a yuzu cocktail which was actually delicious. I'd say this place would be best suited for someone interested in getting drinks and maybe a small plate or two. I wouldn't recommend this as a dinner destination and would not come with a party larger than 2."

(And because I didn't tell the cake recipient the price, they thought it had too much cream - she literally scooped it and threw it out.)"

I asked for a coffee with extra milk and a spinach pie thingy. She didn't bother to wash her hands between mopping the floor and serving the food. Coffee was very weak. Even though their yelp page says gender neutral bathrooms are available., she insisted that restrooms were unavailable.Please don't mislead the public and update your amenities list."

We googled opened bakeries around the area and Capy was definitely the best choice.At around 7pm on a Sunday, Capy still had a variety of tres leches cakes to choose from. The workers really helped me in choosing the best cake by describing the ones that were left. I took somewhat of a while to choose one but they didn't try to rush me out or anything. I finally went with the Nuez tres leches cake. It's made with chocolate and pecans which is a delicious combination. They also wrote Happy Birthday on a ribbon at no charge! The cake was rich and not too milky as some tres leches cakes tend to be. My family loved the cake!They also sell other pastries and cakes by the slice. I definitely recommend stopping by Capy for any of their pastries. If you ever forget to buy a cake for a party, you can count on Capy to have your back!"

98,5vbO0OZK8OPwTdoQcekuTw,6/26/2017,4 star rating,what a great addition to the neighbor this bakery at first doesn't seem like a place that would draw you in but once inside its so hard to leave. They have a decent selection of delicious items for sale most of them for under $5 each. My personal favorites are the Flan and Tres Leches cake which is moist and rich but not overly sweet like other places make it. My wife recently got me a Tres Leches birthday cake omg best cake ever she told me they needed about a weeks notice to make the cake which is about how long other bakeries take also.

As Jamaica already has enough bakeries I frankly did not think they would last. I've been here twice and always think it is such a big space for shelves and displays that often are halfway full.. maybe they sell out quick early in the day? Or know they shouldn't bake so much with competition almost next door. I've had their cappuccino flan, chocolate cake and strawberry cake. They were good- not dry or too sweet. Just a bit pricey for the area."

The real reason is I was craving an insane cheat meal and they really understood the assignment. They provided complimentary wonton chips with sweet & sour sauce and bread & butter. Very strange combination. On to the main dish! The fried chicken was crispy, juicy, but a little too salty. It was also very greasy - obviously it's fried chicken but they could have removed the excess oil before plating it. Same thing with the plantains. Super tasty with a good balance of sweet and savory but a bit too greasy for my liking. The shrimp fried rice was perfect! One of the best I've had honestly. Overall, it was such a satisfying meal and definitely put me to sleep soon after."

The bathroom is gross, and in the ladies' room, ants are crawling around the walls. Kinda gross.The food isn't bad, I ordered the garlic beef stir fry. The portion was big, but a bit tasteless, so I had to ask for hotsauce. I made my own sauce by using the different condiments on the table, and it tasted better. All in all, I won't be coming here for a while. As it didn't leave me wanting to celebrate back for anything else."
104,AEkpyAGcVe5NgH2Nb7fCNQ,5/27/2022,5 star rating,"Growing up with Chino Latino food was always such a treat. The combination of Americanized Chinese food served alongside Latin classics is a match made in tastebud heaven. I came in early Saturday afternoon and the restaurant was empty when I arrived (which I was sad to see), but slowly starting filling up with folks both dining in and ordering takeout by the time I was halfway through my lunch. I arrived around 12:30pm, so it was too early for their killer strong drinks (at least for me). With recommendation of both the helpful waitstaff, and many years observing my father ordering and enjoying it so much, I went with the fried porkchops. Although advertised as only a weekday thing, the gentleman taking my order honored the lunch special which came with one massive porkchop (instead of two served in the full size dinner) along with two sides. I got the house fried rice (a combination of pork, ham and shrimp) and tostones to complete the chini-latino trifecta. I also started the meal with a plentiful wonton soup that was so flavorful and soothing. It was incredible! Fried porkchop cooked perfectly, both crispy and juicy. The rice had a great deal of flavor and the tostones were served with the traditional mojo. I asked for hot sauce and was given a choice of a few, but the housemade chilli oil was perfect an complimented the meal so well."
105,AEkpyAGcVe5NgH2Nb7fCNQ,10/8/2022,3 star rating,The service was great here and some of the food was pretty decent as well. The only issue I had was the tilapia being spoiled. I normally wouldn't order that kind of fish but my son couldn't pick through the bones in their salmon. The value was great for the amount of food you get. I highly recommend the broiled shrimp and fried rice. The crab legs didn't have much flavor and were definitely over cooked and previously frozen.

Good.  When I got to the tostones they were rotten, black centers , totally disgusting . I threw them out. So I went back the next day to complain and re-ordered the tostones and I pressed them and cautioned them to cook only good plantains, so when I got my order I didn't even look because I said, no way they have the balls to do it again. But they padded the top with good tostones and under it there were more rotten plantains.  Nuevo Jardin is now dead to me."

The espresso tonic is my favorite off their menu. My regular go to cortado also doesn't disappoint! Their list of sandwich offerings is also great. A great snack for when your crunching away on the computer or for a pre-workout meal. Alan and his team are always happy and enthusiastic to meet anyone that walks through the door, and take great care in putting your order together.

Quality: Went with a Cold Brew Iced Coffee and was very happy with the flavor. A little bit of bitterness, but not so much to overwhelm the drink. Mixed with some cream and sugar it was very good.Quantity: Standard size drinks.Value: $5.00 for a Medium Cold Brew.Ambiance: Espresso Me is located on the edge of Cobble Hill. It is easy to pass as it is the only business in a deserted strip and right next to a construction site. It looks like they had an outdoor street area, but there were no tables or chairs set up. Inside they had some seating both in the front and alongside the ordering area. Music was quiet and it seemed like a nice place to read or do some work.Crowd: One person set up with a computer and two other guests on line.Service: Quick and friendly service.Parking: With construction, tough street parking."

I asked if there was any kind of pattern to when they do and don't serve food and they said no -- on this particular day *both* baristas were new and hadn't been trained. I heard that exact reason before earlier this year from a different barista. This is a bummer! The food is really good!

146,O0RxMO7AYZCMnOis7a08EA,7/4/2019,5 star rating,"This cafe is in a bit of a weird location; you wouldn't necessarily walk past it unless you're involved with the school across the street. That might change once the places under construction open up on the block. One advantage is that if for whatever reason you're looking to exit the expressway for a nice hipster coffee and you want to park your car, this is a good area for that. The matcha is top notch, none of that gritty stuff you get in some cafes. This is fine powder well mixed! I also really appreciate that they have the option of a smaller cup size. Great espresso here, and everything from snacks to meal sized sandwiches. There are cafes that charge $4 for a small avocado toast; there are cafes that charge $10+ for the same. Here the price is in the middle but they actually give you two pieces of bread absolutely stacked with fresh avo. And it's delicious. Plenty of seating available, nice big front window means lots of natural light, and free WiFi. Gender neutral restrooms, pay by cash or card."

I understand times are tough and so I try to support local businesses and tip generously, but please don't speak on behalf of other businesses that are NOT charging more and still delivering great quality in grace.Flavor wise the food was decent, except for the fried dumplings; not sure if they were air fried or microwaved but they were super dry and spongy.  Also ordered the chicken and broccoli pint - did not know it would not come with rice (as most places do), so came home to find just the entree and no rice.  I will say the entree portion itself seemed bigger compared to other places, but you realize it looks that way because of the size of the container they use (not packed).Overall the taste is fine, but there are a lot of other choices in Jackson Heights to try at better value."

We went on a Sunday evening and the vibe was awesome - feels like being at a really great party!If you've never ordered at a French restaurant before, you honestly can't go wrong trying whatever sounds good here. We tried the escargots, tuna crudo, and crispy artichokes to start. All were great and the perfect amount when shared amongst three. I had the mussels.. they were delicious and huge. Best I've ever had! The broth was rich and tasty. The fries were the perfect side and I ate every last one. YUM.We had the Profiteroles for dessert - it's like a pasty puff with ice cream and melted chocolate - SO GOOD. It was the best way to end a balanced and really unique dining experience. Of all the places we ate when we visited NY, I am so glad we got to go to Pastis."
201,gtXP0CmOnBbgfnff7VXa7A,3/25/2023,4 star rating,"TLDR: Solid French spot in Meatpacking. Probably one of the better restaurants in this area. Traditional French fare. Croque Madame was excellent and don't skip the tartare.We were in the area and figured we should try Pastis. Shared a steak tartare (appetizer size) and a Croque Madame and Gruyere Omlette.The tartare was not too heavy on the sauce. Delicious, tangy, wonderful crunch from the toast points. Probably my favorite dish.The Croque Madame was generous, they even swapped out the potatoes for fries as a courtesy. The sandwich was layered well with plenty of the rich bechamel, the egg, the ham and just the right texture.The Gruyere Omelette was good enough but fairly standard. The smashed potatoes it came with were tasty.The bacon although expensive for a $12 side was excellent. If we find ourselves near here for dinner one evening - perhaps we'll try the more savory entrees."

My coke was never refilled, which was disappointing. I did appreciate that they let us stay and talk about 30 minutes after we finished eating and they never prompted us to leave or asked for the table. The food here was pretty meh which was disappointing since the reviews on here are so great! I took my coworker and her husband here who were visiting the city from Indiana for the first time. We all ordered the steak, and I have to say that it was pretty chewy. My coworker and her husband both asked for well done and they got pretty red meat; I had asked for medium and mine was on the medium rare side. I felt very bad since it was their first time in New York and I wanted to give them a great dining experience! The fries were pretty good which was the highlight of the meal. I might return to try other items on the menu, but it was definitely a disappointing first experience."

We ordered the escargot and french onion soup to start. the soup was so savory and the cheese pull was 10/10 - might have been by favorite dish of the night. The escargot was also so savory and paired very well with bread - a little but salty but otherwise the flavors hit and id def returnlast the clams - a bunch of them didnt have the meat inside but when it did it HIT - so juicy and soft. def would recommend and return"

It was pretty busy so make sure you plan ahead! We ordered the pancakes and the cheeseburger because those were items highlighted on social media and Yelp. Both were good! However, it was not unlike what we've had at other places. Probably could get these dishes for cheaper elsewhere. I'm open to trying Pastis again - we probably didn't order the correct items. I really enjoyed the drink I had which had st. Germain in it.Service was pretty good, our waitress was friendly and checked in on us frequently."

207,gtXP0CmOnBbgfnff7VXa7A,10/13/2022,4 star rating,"Many ages ago, I was actually on #TeamFlorent when it came to Meat Packing District dining.  However, they sadly closed and Pastis helped fill that void.  It's been over a decade since I've been to Pastis, but they still deliver delicious French food in a fun atmosphere. Steak Tartare: In a world where tuna tartare is so common, it's nice to still find steak tartare served.  Tender beef cut into the tiniest of cubes.  Mixed in a tangy flavorful sauce with visible herbs and a whole yolk on top.  So you have to do a little mixing yourself.  Tastes delicious against the thin and crunchy crostini, which helps the focus stay on the steak while only adding a little crunch.  Though they could have used a few more pieces of crostini in my opinion for the large portion of tartare.  The slightly bitter greens and vinaigrette on the side were good for cleansing the palate between bites.Moules Frites: Another brasserie favorite of mine.  They had good quality mussels since only one refused to open and thus had to be discarded.  The rest were fresh with a slight ocean taste.  Loved loved loved the buttery wine sauce so did a lot of slurping.  It was especially nice with the crunchy fries.  Lots of that sauce, so plenty remaining after everything else was eaten.  Ends up being deceptively filling all in.Profiteroles: There's always room for dessert, even after a rich meal.  I especially loved how the warm chocolate sauce was poured over profiteroles at the table; it was quite dramatic.  They had the perfect texture contrast of fluffy choux pastry and rich in-house vanilla ice cream.  The chocolate sauce pour was quite generous, so it was almost like they were dessert matzo balls in a chocolate soup."

Reserved ahead and asked for a nice table as a Resy Global Dining Access member but while seated indoors, we weren't seated in the nicer area indoors so that was a bit of a letdown.Started off with a round of champagne as we were celebrating personal milestones, I kindly asked that this be a separate check as I bought this for our group. They were able to, which was nice. We were given baguette and butter to start off. We decided to share a couple of starters for the table: fresh oysters, moules frites and onion soup. These were all delicious but my personal favorite were the mussels. Wish we were given more bread to soak up all the remaining sauce. For entrees, the 3 of us went for hanger steak. I asked and was charged for the poivre sauce which was fine, I just wish they'd at least inform ahead. My disappointment is I asked for the steak to be medium rare but it was really rare. I tried to eat the steak but couldn't even finish it halfway, thank God I had fries. The poivre sauce also wasn't good. It lacked the peppery taste and wasn't thick. I wish it was as good as Balthazar's. My husband's Cheeseburger Americaine was fantastic and was the redeeming entrée of the day. This is probably what I'll have if I ever go back. Had another round of champagne after. We ordered cappuccinos and profiteroles for dessert. The profiteroles were nice.Overall, service was good despite being very busy and at times slow. But the vibe and energy of the place is what you come here for. We went here on Dec. 26th and was a Monday so not sure if the regular kitchen staff were out post the Christmas service. Look forward to coming back and hopefully everything would be much better."

The attitude the lady gave me at the pick up area was insane. She spoke like she was above us and didn't care about her job at all. She acted like I was trying to scam them when it was really just a miscommunication about the Dave's singles. To make it worse when I got home the new Dave's single she gave me was freezing cold!

In the background there were a few other working who were chanting thing that we couldn't understand. Ultimately we would've cared as much as we did if they got our order correct BUT they literally forgot 2 out of the 5 four-for-fours!!!!!

One of the best breakfast sandwiches I've had in Astoria. Bun was beautifully toasted/warm and the portion of each of the ingredients was plentiful. The vegan bacon was interesting and was a decent alternative for all non-pork eaters. It had a smoky essence to it which was balanced by the eggs and avocado mash. Rose Latte could have used more rose syrup but did the job for a caffeine kick on the drive. A bit pricy for a breakfast sandwich but it is quality. Great addition to Astoria area!"

Cool atmosphere as well as attentive staff buzzing around both inside and out.Between two people, split the Guacamole ($13), Enchiladas ($18), and a Margarita ($12 each). Margaritas come out first, strong pours that paired well with each dish. Guacamole is served in a large bowl, half filled with warm tortilla chips. Chunky texture; just enough spice and citrus. Enchiladas are served last - heavy on the cheese and sauce, but easy to eat overall without needing anything extra.Again, service is quick and the seating is set back enough to not be disturbed by the traffic.

Keep an eye out for Gracias a Dios.We shared an order of tuna tostados. They were so good. I decided to sprinkle a bit of the seasoning that came with the mezcals to amp up the spiciness.

Great ambiance with tons of natural light, and located just outside of the heart of Williamsburg next to McCarren park.Food was fabulous, and the drinks did not disappoint. Try a spicy margarita or a Paloma with a Tajin salted rim for a refreshing afternoon pick me up. Absolutely do not skimp on trying the corn based pancakes with a mint and berry compote. As a group of 5 we split the pancakes for dessert and DEVOURED them. Warm and filling yet fresh from the mint and berries, it ended our brunch on a sweet note.Definitely more optimal for smaller parties (6 or less) who prefer to pay a la cart. Casa Publica is not your typical bottomless brunch spot in the city, but you get what you pay for. Portions are average sized, at about $15-$20 a plate, and are personalized (rather than family style).Service was excellent and appreciated that they did not rush us out. Would be 5 stars, but the brunch menu was not posted online which made it hard for folks with allergies to decide what they could eat ahead of time."

I'm going to start with the bartenders and the drinks.  The bartenders were amazing! Brian was the one that was generally down at our end of the bar, and he was the absolute epitome of what a great bartender should be-attentive, friendly, happy to answer questions and quick to serve the drinks. He really did a great job.  I was sad that there apparently was a shift change while I was off playing games and I didn't get to leave him a tip...he deserved it!Speaking of drinks, I had so much fun exploring the extensive craft beer menu-tried a few I didn't like (Thanks, Brian for bringing me samples to try!) and found more than a few that I absolutely loved.  I also tried the Viking Blood bourbon/mead drink and totally fell in love with it.  Can you say YUMMY?!The food was also delicious.  The burger sliders were AMAZING.  The Tater Tots were great. The fried pickles were awesome. I feel like there was something else I really liked, but I can't remember for sure....umm....please forgive my lapse in memory, but...did you see all the good stuff I drank?The games? Talk about a throwback to my younger days! I had so much fun playing and just watching other people play and have a good time. Galaga, Asteroids, Pacman, Centipede....all the classics and then some! The only improvement I'd like to see is that I wish there were hand sanitizers hanging around throughout the joint.  After touching all those sometimes-sweaty joysticks I would've appreciated a dousing of germ killer!Hand sanitizer or not, if I lived in the city, this would be my local neighborhood hangout, for sure.

However, on this particular day, a couple of friends decided to wear ""ugly Christmas sweaters"" as they were headed to a party afterwards. Unfortunately, we came on a day that Santacon was happening, and a staff member doubled down and told our friends that they couldn't wear their ugly Christmas sweaters and made them take it off. They kindly obliged. When they were ready to leave, they put them back on, but were told they had to leave the premises immediately. Mind you, this rule was enforced by one bartender AFTER drinks and tokens were purchased. The only place this rule was posted was Instagram (which we discovered after the fact), not physically posted anywhere in the bar and not enforced by a bouncer. To really make matters worse, a bartender walked past me at least three times, and a kind individual next to me had to get their attention so I could talk to them.

This restaurant has been around for 20 years and the owner cares so deeply for his customers, restaurant and food. He goes out every day to the market to see what is fresh to prepare the meals for the day. Every time you go, you will be served table bread with olive oil. You can really taste the rich olive flavor. The chicken dishes are great and have a wonderful sauce that does not feel heavy. It costs the chicken just enough. Even though it's chicken breast, it is not dry. You can choose mashed potatoes, fries or vegetables as a side for the entree. The pizza is a new addition. The tomato sauce is homemade and not tart. It's a great addition to the menu.This restaurant also a bar for anyone just looking to have a drink and a good time.

The apps we ordered, however, were pretty solid. Meatballs (homemade but not always available) were tasty and mozzarella sticks were good though not spectacular. Muni parking a few steps away...if you can get lucky and score a spot without endlessly circling or waiting. Lots of competition for them nearby."
255,R_YgtcDGyldFyaPsFhvomA,11/25/2018,4 star rating,"Great brunch w.limited menu, but enough to choose from.  Brunch includes a cocktail, bread, fruit cup and coffee or tea...all for a very reasonable $11.95!  I'll give anyplace a good rating if they know how to make eggs over easy correctly...and they do at Maggie Mays! (You wouldn't believe how many breakfast places don't know how to make proper eggs!). The thing that stood out for me about Maggie Mays (besides the food), is that their staff is young. Now, the cynic may say that they're just trying to get cheap labor but I say, Big Kudos to management for giving these fresh-faced young adults a chance to get some real work experience!  And let me tell ya, this staff was hustling!  It was super busy for Sunday brunch and they did a great time.  We'll be back!"

257,R_YgtcDGyldFyaPsFhvomA,7/2/2017,4 star rating,"With so many eateries on Bell Blvd, one of my sisters, had put the bug in my ear about Brunching here for my post Birthday celebration. Maggie Mays lets out the typical Irish pub feel: the dark woods and a sizable bar. For $11.95, you get 2 Mimosas, a Fruit Cup, Entree (French Toast or Eggs any style or an Omelette), bacon or sausage (I passed on both) and Coffee or Tea. Not a bad deal. Right? On paper, Menu doesn't have a wide range of selections but for the most part, it offered really basic Brunch items. Mimosas were a huge disappointment and came up extremely short on the bubbly and felt, I was drinking straight up, iced orange juice. As was, my Seltzer & cranberry, that was chilled but tasted bland- while I waited for my sisters earlier. Luckily, my Omelette, tasted good and was fully prepared with fresh mushrooms (not canned), cheddar cheese and a side of nicely-charred, thin Breakfast Potatoes. My Niece, sisters and Mumsy, all complimented and enjoyed their burgers.All in all, No complaints on the food or from the staff as we were served by a couple young girls who were sweet and attentive (and the tall guy, also). However, inexpensive Brunch concept at $11.95......it was just too good to be true."

Omelettes are lovey, scrambled eggs are nice and soft, not overcooked. Steak was cooked med, I asked for med rare but it is a fairly thin  steak. Still a mild flavor and perfect for steak and eggs. Potatoes were cooked with pepper me and onions for that warm yummy sweetness. The bread basket and fruit cups that accompany the meal were a spot on! Nice touch but work on the cocktails folks !That all being said this was the best most agreeable meal I've had all week!"

Not a huge difference than fast food  table layout outside. Dining is the whole experience of food and ambience. Dishes were not bad,  but I was very disappointed tonight and regret we came here. After main meal, we ordered the dessert, tiramisu.  It was hard and not tasty at all. Very disappointed. Next time if we come,  we will book inside."

Caesar Salad was incredible -- dressing is on point and loved the anchovies on top; Burrata was creamy, soft, fresh, and scrumptious with tomatoes and spring peas; Veal Milanese was perfectly seasoned, crisp, and fresh with a light, delicious salad on top; Pappardelle Bolognese was the highlight of the meal -- the sauce was light, packed with meat, and pasta was perfectly cooked.

The dishes from the apps to the entrees all arrived lukewarm and was almost cold within minutes. The flavors of each dish however were excellent, as they were bold and very flavorful. Especially the Sfoglia's Chicken and Mussels. There are no real specials or additions to the existing menu. Overall, the turning point was the dessert, which is special each season. We ordered the peach torte with ice cream, this was actually warm and deliciously melted with the ice cream."

Location: It is located at UES, lexington Ave. We made reservations cause it is always packed here! There is outdoor and indoor seating! The indoor is nice, quite dark. The outdoor is nice, feels like you are in Italy. Street parking available at the sideService: OMG our server is nice. I noticed that she is in the elderly side, and I love that, it means that the restaurant does not discriminate! Thank you for that.Food: Food here is hit or missed! BURRATA: this was my first Burrata and it was delicious!! Omg! There are green peas on it and the burrata is so silky. SFOGLIA CAESAR: the best caesar salad I had in my life! It was perfect! Not too much or too less of the dressing and I love the anchovies on it! CURED ITALIAN MEATS: this is good as well, different types of meat with a good bread sticks! PAPPARDELE: good, taste like deconstructed lasagna! FETTUCCINI: best fettuccine that I ate, the cream and chunks of ham is good, the pasta was al dente! SAFFRON RISOTTO: the risotto was cooked well, didn't got that much of the crab tho. SFOGLIA'S CHICKEN AL MATTONE: they said this was very popular but it was okay for me, it is like fried chicken with lemon on it. It was okay. BONE IN VEAL CHOP: another one that was okay. Expensive but it was just fried with a side of salad, nothing special for me. STRAWBERRY RHUBARB TORTA: omg this was good! The crust was so good and the filling was not that sweet which I like! The ice cream binds it together, the thing is you have to preorder this so order it on the beginning!Price rating: 9/10, quite expensive to be honest but if you buy what I recommend you will be fine.Will probably come back here for the Caesar salad, buratta, fettuccini and the strawberry rhubarb torta! 2 orders each!!

I have a service animal, I originally requested my reservations for outside; however it was very hot (90 degrees and very humid). We asked to be seated inside instead and provided documents to support our service animal. We where seated in an entirely different room away from all the other patrons. We then we're asked to have our service animal tied to a specific corner of our table!!! So not only where we pushed out of the dining area...we were also restricted to the parameters were she can rest! In complete violation of ADA! They weren't knowledgeable nor apologetic. When we addressed our concern, the manager was completely defensive and made soooo many excuses as why he segregated us.Such a shame especially since I've been wanting to try this place out since October. Can't comment on the food. However, in regards to service.... guests with disability's, they are unwelcoming and discriminatory."

The menu changes frequently, but they always have a couple of pastas that can be made vegan and salads or sides as well. The pesto is vegan which is awesome and it happens to be amazing as well! The seasonal panzanella is my favorite dish they make. The pastas are always well cooked and flavorful. If you have a kiddo they will make a half portion of pasta for them which is super nice. It's a great local neighborhood place but also the kind of place I'd travel for!"

I mean it was okay, just not something to rave about. Their pastries on the other hand are always GREAT, as long as you get there early and catch the fresh ones. Chocolate croissants, almond croissants, muffins, ... they are always so good. Loved getting oat latte here as well with a nice latte art  + the staff (Hi Pearl & Sylvia!) is always friendly to us -- always nice seeing them there in the morning with a smile on their faces and greeting us and everybody. For some reason, the bananas they sell there are always just right lol Like I would abandon the ones at home and grab one there instead!"

Today was my first time finally dining in because I just really enjoy my espresso drinks more when I sit down and have it. Maybe it's a visual thing but I'm a firm believer that you eat with your eyes first.So I came here with the intention to do some work on my laptop but they have this weird policy where you can't use your laptop cause it was a weekend day. I know some cafes do that and I'm not exactly sure what the reason is. They did say however that since it wasn't too busy that I could use it on the big shared table. Appreciated it but I needed an outlet since my laptop was dead so I just decided to have my drink and leave, which was unfortunate.Aside from that slight inconvenience, I enjoyed the rest of my experience. I ordered the coconut kiss, which is an espresso with half n half and coconut but in the size of a cortado. I was really craving a quality espresso drink and this satisfied it, which I was surprised cause I didn't expect this in my neighborhood. It was silky smooth (which was the type of drink I was really craving at the moment) with great tasting espresso and coconut working together. Coconut and espresso just work so well together.I'm definitely coming back. Probably not to do work on the weekends which was unfortunate cause I was hoping this could be a new addition to my list of study spots close to me. I'll try to see how it is on the weekdays I don't really like to be rushed when I'm studying at a cafe so let's see. But maybe to just enjoy a drink and chill or catch up with a friend. I consider this one of the best espresso in my neighborhood, but then again the options are limited. I'm glad this is here"

The price of the food doesn't match the counter service imo. For two of us to get entrees and and a ginger drink was nearly $80. I got the platter with a whole branzino fish that was about $36 if I remember correctly. The fish was yummy and the sides were unique but not as good. My friend got the same but with lamb. The lamb was a suuuuuper small portion and not that tasty. Wouldn't recommend. The hunger drink was refreshing and just spicy enough. All and all it was good and I might return just more prepared for the price point. Ps: you have to bus your own tables. Staff was lovely

The backyard was packed when I visited (good for them!) so I sat inside. I had the Risbo Platter to try a bit of everything and got the chicken. The platter is plenty of food for one person, and I even ended up taking some home! Chicken was kicking, no notes; also ate up the humus and spicy cabbage salad. There is a separate bar that you can grab a drink from. The bartender was very friendly, and after I finished my meal I relocated from the shared tables to a spot at the bar for another glass of wine. Risbo is a neighborhood gem!

It honestly tasted different than any lamb I've had before. Everything else I had though was AMAZING! So tasty and fresh. Their definitely could have been more plantain in the food (my favorite).

The music is def my style lots of afro  and future beats, neo soul, r&b some hip hop. Its just good stuff. There is a small bar that actually pretty short height  wise. Im 6'6 and it sits below my waist. You might as well sit at a table. The drinks however are head and shoulders above much of the neighboring establishments. Their food is homey. All the meats are rotisserie roast on the spot. They offer a nice collection of sides similar to what you would see at Dig Inn. They also over changing chef specials like market fish and tacos. The price is somewhere between casual and restaurant dining. Expect to spend $15-25 (without drinks). You also have to pick up and toss out your own food.

The moment we stepped in, we fell in love with the modern parlor decor. The space may be small, but the tables are thoughtfully placed in a way to minimize crowding and maximize comfort. One glance at nearby tables told me that the Chubby Chicken Sandwich and the Shakshuka were popular, but I had my heart set on some pancakes and fried chicken, so the Chicken and Not Waffles was the perfect choice. I love that they decided to swap out the waffles for pancakes because my hot take is that pancakes  are better than waffles. Our meal was completed with a side order of hand cut fries. Food came in a timely manner and we dug in with gusto. I was surprised to find that my dish was AMAZING. I love that they used a chicken thigh cutlet that was thinly sliced, juicy, and dripping with the flavor of savory/sweet honey. My pancakes were topped with some honey butter that gave the fluffy cakes an even richer flavor. These were the types of pancakes that dreams are made of. The portion size was perfect for satisfying my appetite. In between bites, we munched on thick cut fries as well. Staff were so attentive and friendly throughout our visit, and get bonus points for keeping the restroom in a polished state. Come to Queens Room to dine like queens and kings."

Although the tables can be located close to one another, it is actually not bad because you can have a decent conversation without loud music blasting , like some restaurants.I also prefer a brunch menu that has basic offerings and some cool curated items .

The Queen's Room hits the mark on the menu from their drinks , to their starters and main dishes.My dining partner went with Croissant-which with a side salad . She requested the egg to be runny and she was taken care of.I enjoyed the Eggs Benedict with salmon, nestled with a hash brown patty . It also comes with a side salad.We had a hot toddy, which was perfect for a cold winter day.

I ordered the loaded potato hash, and it was just alright. The portion size was good, but it needed some salt, pepper, and other seasonings. Got the Applewood smoked bacon, and at least this had flavoring. So, I'm not sure if I would ever return, granted there are so many places to eat in the area and with mediocre service, I'm very skeptical of taking my time out to go here again."

The service is always great, the food delicious and the drinks even better. Small town charm in the big city. Their menu is ways changing and in the summer they have chairs they set up in the street for the ""open streets program"". If you're looking for a local spot where the staff will remember you by name this is the place. If you're on the go, and don't want to sit and enjoy the free Wi-Fi/make a morning at Queen's Room, grab a coffee to go. My god, the caffeine in each shot is life changing. It's super fuel. One cup of their cold brew or and iced americano, and you'll be set for hours...be ready for some bold flavor. The baristas are always prompt and have octopus arms getting all the drinks ready."

I also tried so pasta with a cream sauce I would lick off a NY subway rat. The ambiance is just perfect! With some music playing, but not to the point that you cant have a conversation. My favorite drink was the espresso martini! It ascended me to heaven with one sip. Overall, fabulous service, food and drinks!"

For the price im paying I expect more(size wise) but I thought okay inflation.  But I was so shocked I dont even know which one was which, i felt like i ate potato empnada with 2 strands of meat (if I was lucky). It was not beef/ chicken it was potato, please tell me where was the meat??? I dont know how many family members they have giving all these fake good reviews about their empanadas. But there is no beef/chicken its just potato. It feels like they are not even trying to put meat in it."
330,nEiriWPxJD0iRJ4SSi0SdA,11/7/2021,4 star rating,Loved how they actually listened to how I wanted my Chorizo cooked well done & cut into slices. Usually Colombian bakeries & restaurants never want to listen so it was plus for me! First time having their arepa con queso and it was delicious! Their empanadas are definitely the best I ever had! Highly suggest coming here if you're craving empanadas!
331,nEiriWPxJD0iRJ4SSi0SdA,12/2/2022,5 star rating,"They have really good empanadas. We got the cheese, beef, and chicken. The beef and chicken were mixed with potatoes. They were all really delicious, crispy on the outside and inside really tasty."

There was no menu - so we asked to order 3 of each - turns out to be cheese, chicken, pork. The shell is freshly fried, filling soft and seasoned well. The cheese empanada needs to be eaten immediately before the cheese hardens. Service is pretty slow but the empanadas are fresh and worth the wait!"
334,nEiriWPxJD0iRJ4SSi0SdA,6/8/2019,3 star rating,They have the best chicken and beef empanadas hands down! They are fast and efficient. The only downside is that they pretend that they cannot deliver to specific areas ie. the back of the hospital. FYI if I'm paying you for a service and you expect to be tipped please walk around the back of the building so my coworkers and I can receive our food. Doesn't make since to play cat and mouse with my delivery because the drivers want to stand at the main entrance. Also I don't understand why they cannot separate and label the empanadas. It would be nice to a variety of dipping sauce to choose from. Don't get me wrong the spicy red sauce it delish but gimme some mixed mayo & ketchup please or how about green sauce?
335,nEiriWPxJD0iRJ4SSi0SdA,5/30/2021,5 star rating,Fresh empanadas all they long... just ask for it... we normally ordered to go but in store ambient is good... they play good music. Staff is very friendly and price is convenient.
336,nEiriWPxJD0iRJ4SSi0SdA,11/29/2018,4 star rating,*CASH ONLY* Oh the empanadas are amazing. Beef has good flavor and the outside has a slight crunch. Must have the hot sauce. Grilled steak w/ rice and beet or potato salad are very good as well. I also tried the oz tail soup. That was eh. Not flavorful so I'll skip this. Prices are reasonable.

That being said, WOW, this place is going downhill fast or maybe I just had a bad experience.It all started with the waiter barely understanding what we were ordering. He did not know what an avocado toast is... okay, no biggie. He asked a different waiter and he said that they did not have but they have fresh avocados and they would slice one up and put it in bread. The bread was overly toasted and tasted burnt! The chicken and waffles... is making me nauseous even thinking about it. The more time that went on, the more oil that kept leaking out from the chicken. I asked for my turkey bacon to be well done and it was just as flooded in oil. My coffee tasted sour and days old.We barely touched our food and knew it was time to go. The customer service is also lacking. If you see we just arrived and left without even eating, how about ask your customers if everything was fine.Also, in addition to training your staff, please get new plates... those plates are dirty, old and cracking."

The waiter and bus boy kept filling up my water glass continuously. My Diet Coke was replenished more than once. Good food. Good service. pleasant people. What more do you want in a diner?

347,c_dqcBhH21bGYBVbx9T9Mw,10/13/2020,2 star rating,"First of all, in the middle of the pandemic, they are reusing disposable menus. They gave me a disposable paper menu and it was sticky with some sauce on it. I immediately pulled out my hand sanitizer to clean my hands. Once they took my order, that paper menu went straight back to the top of the menu pile. I'd rather have them give me a regular menu so they can sanitize it properly after every customer if they are going to reuse a paper/disposable one!The Huevos Rancheros was not really Huevos Rancheros. It's served in a taco bowl. How hard is it to serve it on regular tortillas? And the refried beans had raw onions in it. The avocado and other garnished veggies were dry and looked like they had been sitting around for a while. And it's topped with cheddar cheese.... I really couldn't eat much of it.My coffee cup had a stain on the inside that wasn't washed off properly. And we are in a pandemic. I give them 2 stars because the service was good. The employees all are wearing masks and they were cool about giving me a new hot cup of coffee when mine completely cooled off. Also it's nice they have patricians between the booths which makes me feel a little more comfortable regarding the virus."

It was good, nothing special. Adding the Cholula Hot Sauce was a must. The burrito was a bit smaller than expected. For $16, I assumed it would be slightly bigger. Dining experience: There wasn't any music playing, like at most restaurants. The diner was more on the quiet side. The toilet also broke down upon using it. The service was quick and decent, though. All in all, Cosmic Diner is average."

This was a brunch time so I went for the brunch special of Mediterranean omelette. It was served with hash brown potatoes. The brunch menu also included a choice of mimosa or Bloody Mary - I decided on Mimosa which was tasty and refreshing. The omelette was good, no complaints. My only grudge would be with coffee, which was undrinkable, it had a strange smell. Nice, friendly, attentive, prompt service."
355,9ilN8KuM_-lRXbpvp-erNw,3/21/2023,1 star rating,"Ate there about a week ago.  The only good thing I can say is that our order was brought out quickly.  Other than that things were terrible.  The food was mediocre at best.  It tasted and looked like it had been made in advance and was just warmed up (which may have been why it was served so quickly).  When we tried to flag down a waiter to get some hot sauce and, later, our check, it took way to long to get anyone's attention.  On top of that, they add an additional charge if you use a credit card.  In our case it was $1.62 on a $40.00 bill.  Who does that in a major US city these days?  There are better places all over NYC.  Do not waste your time and money eating at this one."

I  do not like my liver over cooked and dry. They cooked it just right.  The hash browns were very good, along with the Manhattan chowder. Vegetable were okay.

We ordered the octopus as appetizer to share and each ended up with our own pasta dish- I ordered the ravioli and was not disappointed! The dough tasted fresh and the flavor of the dish itself was amazing!Cost: A tad expensive but still reasonable for a NYC night out for dinner.Environment: The place gave off a cozy vibe- some of the tables were family style so you may have to share a table with other customers as well. Pretty dim lighting but provided more mood to the place. Seating seemed pretty limited so would recommend rsvping prior to coming especially if you have a large party.Service: Good service, food came quickly and the server checked up on us routinely.Uniqueness: If you're craving some pasta, feel free to stop by here and check this place out!"

Their Yelp page says that it's ""helmed by a James Beard award-winning chef,"" however, when I walked into the restaurant, there was an ENTIRE WALL OF MICROWAVES VISIBLE. It's a beautiful little wine/Italian tapas spot, with a view of... a wall of microwaves. Is that not the biggest red flag ever? None of it adds up and I've never been in a restaurant that doesn't even bother to hide the fact that they use a microwave... especially when it looks like they've put so much care into the rest of the space. The microwaves immediately make you feel like you're being fooled and that nothing you order is being cooked. We sat outside and when we ordered, they were not able to make any modifications. My friend is allergic to mushrooms and wasn't able to order his meal without mushrooms. Once I saw the microwaves though, it all clicked that the food is probably pre-made somewhere else, as this place is small. Our food was just okay and we were disappointed that we wasted a meal in a city with such incredible food. We're still confused."

Wife said it was too windy to sit outside, and we went indoors.  Indoor family table with 18 high stools, besides the bar.  They directed us to sit on opposite sides of the long table.  Eventually a party of 4 sat on one end of the table, and a party of 3 sat on the other end of the table, with us 2 in-betweens.  Hot bread is complimentary, but you have to ask for it.  My $10 minestrone soup full of potatoes, carrots, green beans. A bit thin as more of a clear chicken broth than the usual tomato based.  Average portion size.  Would not order again.  Waiter recited a long list of special dishes not on the menu.  One of them was branzino, which I would have ordered, but knew my wife loves the similar Chilean sea bass.  I pointed this out to her, and she ordered it on the spot. Wife's $27 branzino was buttery in texture, delicious flakes of white fish.  Excellent price for sea bass. Served on top of mashed potatoes to make it look larger, with spinach on the side.  The European bass was an extra and not on the daily menu, with portion large for the price.My $18 Bolognese, small dish on a huge plate.  Delicious but could have used more ground beef, and more sauce, and on the small size portion.   More cheese than ground beef.  Getting out was a feat, as little room between people's behinds and the wall to exit.  Need to pay close attention to the waiter detailing the many extras not on the menu.  Missed out my chance to eat Hungarian goulash over noodles!   Next time!"

We sat outdoors, and the area was heated so well, comfortable, and had great music. Our waitress was phenomenal - so on top of everything and made sure our experience was amazing. And the food. The mozzarella pomodoro basilico was the best mozzarella dish I've ever had - I don't know what the cheese was seasoned with but it was spectacular! I had the pesto pasta as my main, and my friend had the bolognese - and both were cooked to perfection. The wine selection was also wonderful - I've been looking for a place with verdicchio for years and finally found it here, and it was delicious. Perhaps the best part was the speed - in and out in under an hour, which is so important when you're eating here before a show! highly recommend - we will definitely be back."

The texture of the pasta did not taste very fresh in my opinion and there was not much flavor in the dish. I would not get this dish again.My friend got the fettuccine with wild mushrooms and truffle oil and that dish was much better than the orecchiette due to more sauce and more flavoring.The bread they gave us at the start seemed old and not fresh. Service was fine. The ambiance of the place is dark, some lighting and diners share one long table which could be awkward if you want more privacy to talk to whoever you're eating with. It could be more of a communal feel if you're into that."

They're rude and have a sense of entitlement. The supposed ""host"" who wears a black knitted cap, will clean up tables and ignore you just the same as the wait staff. They'll serve patrons who walk in AFTER you but not you until they feel like it.I get that this place is busy, but that's not an excuse to ignore customers. I've seen busier restaurants than this dump and the wait staff talks to you to let you know they see you. I blew up at one of the waiters last night, who I've seen before and have been waited on by before who had a shitty fkn attitude. Which one is he? The only one who wears a mask, so he's easily identifiable.  That one is a true p.o.s.I've been coming here for a long, long time and the attitudes were never this bad until the last 2 years. All the other reviews on here complaining about bad, awful service justify exactly my feelings. And it looks as if the manager of this place doesn't care. So Reggio, get bent."

I was shocked to see how inexpensive it was. That was a plus. It was not too busy at all just one person in front of me but it was kind of the slow side."

It was around 2 and we had no problem getting a table outside. My partner had an iced cold brew that was perfectly smooth. I of course had to try a cappuccino. They are not listed on the menu, but they have several milk options including oat and almond. I went with almond milk and the cappuccino is perfectly foamy which is hard to do with almond milk so props to them.The service was great and we love sitting outside enjoying the sun.

We only got appetizers but I'd recommend the Mac and cheese (we got it without the bacon and mushrooms), mozzarella and fries combo, and the Buffalo chicken tenders. Things to keep in mind: they add a covid fee to your bill (around 4%)."
388,Yb6PQ_4YQpJ0SVZ1tetkbg,1/1/2023,4 star rating,"I went to this Cantonese restaurant also known as Queens High Pearl with one of my groups albeit larger as a holiday and end of the year celebration. The runner of the event had been here prior and we ordered several dishes including some from the specials menu that are only in Chinese. As that is the case, I don't know the exact names or prices for some of the dishes. Overall I liked the food and there were definitely some standouts. I actually preferred the non seafood dishes in general but it's also might be because I tend to prefer meat dishes when it comes to Cantonese food.The first dish that arrived was the Cantonese Style Lobster/蔥薑龍蝦 (AKA lobster with scallions/ginger) and it was pretty good. I kind of prefer lobster in other Chinese styles as I'm not a huge fan of cornstarch especially it has kind of needs to be picked up. The lobsters were reasonably sized and there was a pretty good amount of meat. Outside of this dish, there were a few other seafood and shellfish dishes. As I have an allergy, I didn't try the Stir Fry Squid Head With Greens (outside of the greens which had a nice brown sauce) or the Deep Fried Squid. I likewise avoided the squid and octopus from the Assorted Seafood Pot but it was a nice mix of seafood from the fish to the scallops to everything else in there though as normal for most Cantonese food on the slightly bland end.The Scallion Beef Stir Fry/葱爆牛肉 might have been my favorite dish. The beef was cut then and had enough fat to be very tender and rich which was balanced by the scallions. The Stir Fry Noodle With Fish and Chives/白飯魚小炒 was tasty. I liked the noodle texture a lot and the chives had a wonderful freshness. I also liked the Chinese Cauliflower With Preserved Meat (which consisted of lap cheong/Chinese sausage and lap yuk/Chinese bacon.) There was a plentiful amount of said pork and the cauliflower had a nice texture. It was perhaps a little bit salty but I still very much enjoyed it. Last and more mid was the Peking Pork Chops/京都排骨. The dish wasn't as sweet as some other spots which was a good thing but there was a bit too many bony pieces. I preferred the version for instance at Wu's Wonton as the fry was better also. There was also oddly some pineapple on the plate as well. They gave us some fresh tasty orange slices at the end.The food overall here was pretty good. My rating is more based on the fact of this is Cantonese food and that comes with a little bit of blandness. The meatier dishes were quite tasty and the staff was friendly. Mid 3."
389,Yb6PQ_4YQpJ0SVZ1tetkbg,1/23/2023,2 star rating,"My family has been here several times and out of convenience and price, we recently reserved a few tables for a family event. We ordered a lot of typical popular Cantonese dishes... lobsters with ginger and scallion, shrimp with walnuts, Peking pork chop, soup with fish maw, Hk steak, e fu noodles, veggies.. whole fried chicken. The best dish and almost cheapest.., was the Peking pork chop which I think was a lot better than the HK steak. Very authentic, pork wasn't dry. The veggies was actually pretty good, very crispy. The other vegetable dish was so salty my mom couldn't eat it at all but I didn't try it. Lobster was ok.. Shrimp with walnuts wasn't good. Shrimp tasted off, Mayo came on the side.. which was a good thing since it was terrible. Again my opinion, but I love this dish normally but it wasn't fresh that day. Soup was tasty. E fu noodles are usually bland but had a ton of chewy mushrooms and not enough noodles. Fried chicken was completely overcooked and bland. My mom couldn't eat it. I didn't try it but she should've mentioned it at the restaurant. No wonder there was leftover chicken from every table. The white rice wasn't even good. Not jasmine rice for sure. It looked like old rice or someone who has never made rice before cooked it and it came out all lumpy and dry. I wouldn't have chosen to come here myself especially with their horrifying health inspections but I didn't have much of a choice. Since I do have a weaker stomach, I did end up sick from the meal but I don't think anyone else had any issues. I think people come here since it's pretty affordable compared to other Cantonese restaurants in Queens. Hopefully I don't have to come back here..."

The chicken also won praise for actually tasting like chicken (a bit of a running joke for the family).   Service is friendly with typical Canto banter.
391,Yb6PQ_4YQpJ0SVZ1tetkbg,4/11/2022,5 star rating,"I've been coming here for more than 15 years and this place is the most delicious and authentic Cantonese food in town. I hear rumors that they're closing later this year because the owner is getting old and that makes me so sad because the food here is a staple. When I'm far from good Chinese food I find myself craving this place and my Chinese family always comes here when we've been on a long trip away from Chinese food. Jellyfish appetizer is a must - crunchy, sweet, chewy jellyfish with plenty of Chinese ham slices. Tie Ban XI Zo Gai Pian or Sizzling Chicken Platter with black bean sauce is a winner esp if you dine in. The pic here doesn't do it justice but trust me GET THIS! Onions and mushrooms so be aware. I love both I know those two are common dislikes. So so good, salty and tender slices of chicken in a fragrant salty, umami and sweet black bean sauceFish and Tofu dish is now another favorite after discovering it recently the tender giant pieces of fish and the soft, nicely stewed chunks of tofu. Wow. What a bang for your buck! Black Pepper Scallops are so good they've got a nice starchy coating on them rich with black pepper to give it that nice punchy pepper flavor before you get this salty sweet glaze and then tender, tender scallop underneath it all. Writing this review makes me want to go back asap.Get your taste buds through the door before this place shuts its doors !"

I only ordered from Howong one time and will give them the benefit of the doubt if they redeem themselves on my next visit, but I feel I still have to throw caution to the wind for other customers to lower their expectations.As of July 2021, Howong still doesn't allow for dine in, so my family and I ordered takeout on a random Saturday afternoon for a lunch celebration. We only ordered the following entree dishes, but it still came out to $75+, which felt quite pricey for what we ordered:Young Chow Fried Rice $8.95Chinese Mushroom & Vegetable w. Long Life Noodles (Yi Mein) $16?Braised Bean Curd w. Black Mushroom & Vegetable $10.95Sauteed Flounder Filet w. Vegetables $25.95Crispy Garlic Chicken (Half) $13.95My gripe wasn't about the quality of the food because the food wasn't bad at all. I really liked the Fried Rice and Noodles. Honestly, those are 2 dishes that are hard to screw up and they were right on here. The Braised Bean Curd was delicious too and actually had a fair number of pieces of bean curd in there. The Crispy Garlic Chicken was blah and maybe could have used a few more pieces. HOWEVER, when it came to the Sauteed Flounder Filet w. Vegetables, we were absolutely LIVID! For $25.95 and it being one of the more expensive dishes on the menu, the serving size was appalling. Not even 1/3 of the tupperware that it was placed into was filled. I'm not sure who the chef who cooked it up was, but, quite frankly, it was an embarrassing portion of fish. It really ruined our experience ordering from this restaurant and, although I said maybe I would give them another chance, at the moment when we saw how little food there was in the tupperware, it was very hard for me to imagine we would ever order from them again.Once again, the food wasn't bad flavor-wise, but the serving size really made us regret ordering from them. I'll definitely try to give them another chance, but I'm very hesitant to do so if they are going to be stingy with their flounder."

So, we decided to come here with the mother-in-law. Upon  entering, the restaurant is medium in size, with the rightmost wall being partially comprised of large mirrors. The wall in the back stands out from the rest with its vibrant red color being illuminated by a soft light. Three regular tables sit by the window near the entrance while the rest of the tables are circular tables that fit up to eight people. Mini chandeliers hang over the circular tables as well. We ordered chicken with cashew nuts. Hubs said that he never had this outside. He said that he enjoyed it very much and found it hard to believe that it's an Americanized dish. Daughter said that the cashews were freshly roasted and it's something that she'd never experienced until that day. She absolutely loved it. Next, we ordered braised tofu and fish fillet casserole. This is one of Hubs' favorites and it didn't disappoint. He thought it was great. Finally, we had the special Buddha's delight. Hubs said that he forgot how much he loves buddha's delight at restaurants. it didn't have vermicelli in it but he didn't miss that. This was a great vegetarian dish.Everything was so delicious that I forgot to take most of the entree pictures except for the seafood casserole. This place could use an upgrade.

They refused to give me the free whopper and said it only applied on Tuesday but it went through on the app. The manager was super rude when I went back to the drive thru to ask why my order was missing items and refused to even enter the code that it says on the app (it clearly said to show the manager the code if the app did not automatically apply).

Woodside's Home of the Whopper is no winner in the fast food game, not even close when it comes to its relatively closeby sister locations who are holding the flame broiled fort down with respective ease.Some good things:* Food is consistent. BK is BK for sure.* It's still open late. Till midnight each night.* Parking lot is big, but this is likely because Northern Blvd is mainly all cars and little public transit.Some bad things:* The drive-thru line is not as defined as it could be. This leads to some awkward backup whenever it's the morning commuters or late night snackers.* Drive-thru mic or speaker is constantly broken. Either the staff isn't hearing me or I'm trouble hearing them over the cracked speaker. Or maybe (just maybe), it's a combination of both.* Only a few years ago, this place was revered for a clean and large bathroom. Today, it's still large. That's it. * Service could be better. They're fast, but can cop an attitude even faster. That and they have been known to get an order wrong or three. I'd be quick the blame the drive-thru, but this happens just as frequently in person as well.Some terrible things:* They're no longer 24 hours. So much for all night chicken fries.* It's still BK."
406,5zS2YPsslyJ4XK1E11udSg,5/13/2021,5 star rating,Drive thru very efficient. People working in this location are amazing. Thank you to all. Please give them a rise!  I remember few years ago my car broke down near BK and I asked them if would be possible to leave my car there over night to get my mechanist in the morning. They helped me out without hesitation! I will be always very grateful for that. Whoppers and are delicious too!!!
407,5zS2YPsslyJ4XK1E11udSg,2/9/2015,3 star rating,I usually don't review these fast food places but this one opens 24-hours and has a parking lot. For times when you need food at the strangest hours of the night.It is not an easy-off/easy-on spot. Coming off and on the Brooklyn-Queens-Expressway is a little trick because of the no left turn at 69 St. and Northern Blvd. Just go that extra block and turn around.

I wish they brought the very reasonably priced surf & turf special back! I always substituted the fries in this dish with a salad and they never gave any tude nor charged me extra for doing so. Moreover, the salad they added was delicious, not just a few lettuce leaves thrown about as you would expect when you substitute fries with a salad. It had sliced almonds, some kind of radicchio-like greens and a really subtle dressing, none of that bitter diner ""vinaigrette"". Trufa has saved me!!! I recently purchased a co-op here in Harlem and haven't had a fully functioning kitchen for a little over a month. I have eaten at Trufa 2-3/week except for a short trip out of town. Not one time was I disappointed. I highly recommend this small popular neighborhood joint. I do wish the lights were less bright in the evening inside the restaurant (but I typically do lunch and it doesn't matter). Fine-tune little things like lighting, otherwise excellent"

The pepperoni is deliciously greasy.They don't deliver or I would eat them more. As it is, I'm happy to walk 5 min out of the way to hit them up when I'm in the Parkside area."
449,Gr-5hjfSUO_ZAfOdwnqWpw,4/7/2021,5 star rating,"Delicious pizza and even nicer owners!! First of all, the pizzas are HUGE. Two pieces had be absolutely stuffed! We got half Margherita, half veggie. The Margherita was excellent--just what I needed. My friends are also vegetarian, so they've had their fair share of veggie pizzas. They said this was one of the most well-done, robust veggie pizzas they've ever had. The pizza dough/crust was also so soft and chewy. We also got the garlic knots, which were a bit disappointing. There was way too much garlic. I would've taken off a star, but the service here is so superb that I added it back on. Definitely stop by for a great slice (or more) of pizza!"
450,Gr-5hjfSUO_ZAfOdwnqWpw,2/15/2023,5 star rating,The absolute sweethearts that work here set this place apart. I was walking down Flatbush being like okay let me just try to get a little bit of a beverage on my way to the park. But I also hadn't had lunch so I was like okay let me grab a little slice while I'm here too. It's a normal pizza joint it's got a bunch of different veggie and meat options everything looks delicious. I eat all the above but I went for a broccoli and ricotta. I got a fruit punch to go with. First of all they actually heat up the pizza slice to where it's hot and a lot of places don't bother to wait that extra 45 seconds so thumbs up on that. Second of all the fruit punch was all fruit punch it wasn't a bunch of ice well a little bit of fruit punch in it so thumbs up on that as well. Third and most importantly the individual behind the counter with all the tattoos on their face was absolute kind-hearted soul. I will definitely come back to this pizza place because a lot of pizza places they just kind of grunt at you and they're rude and this individual made me feel very comfortable and welcome. Great job family Pizza
451,Gr-5hjfSUO_ZAfOdwnqWpw,8/28/2022,5 star rating,"This is my #1 favorite classic slice spot in Brooklyn. Also if I'm having some friends over for something casual or on a Friday night, it's a great place to order a couple of pies, they'll whip them up in 15 minutes tops. I can't stress enough how happy and nostalgic a pepperoni slice or peppers and olives makes me...or just their classic cheese is perfection. Sturdy enough to load em up the way you want your New York slice to be. Heroes are great too. The value is unmatched."
452,Gr-5hjfSUO_ZAfOdwnqWpw,2/16/2022,5 star rating,"This is no frills pizza at its finest. I have never had a bad experience from Family Pizza. They are always on time, the pizza is always hot, and it is incredibly affordable. I always stick with a classic cheese pizza, although I will splurge and get a buffalo chicken pie from time to time. Their chicken parm heroes are also incredible. Cheap, massive in size, and very satisfying. Family Pizza is reliable, delicious, and will be at your door before you hang up the phone."

456,Gr-5hjfSUO_ZAfOdwnqWpw,10/19/2020,4 star rating,"They serve an excellent version of a classic New York slice, one that's sturdy enough to eat with one hand without it flopping over, and with a crust so tasty you eat every last bite of it. The ratio of cheese to sauce to bread was ideal, and in true New York form, I covered mine in oregano, chili flakes, and garlic powder. They have a little window you can order and pay at without even stepping inside, so they have a set up ideal for pandemic times. I inhaled a slice on the way to the grocery store, feeling so lucky that amazing pizza can exist around every corner when you live in New York."

First things first, I think, the guy cooking and the guy taking the orders are family, or brothers of life, because the relationship they have, the way the orders are been yelled across the room and no mistakes , no forgotten order , no error in order taking is pretty amazing. Went there to pick up a veggie omelette with mozzarella. Tasty! Also had home fries as a side order, they give you a LOT of home fries, I couldn't finish them. Overall , will recommend and I will return ."
468,W4hobe10Fy54MKqmLaObEg,3/18/2023,5 star rating,"This place is worth a visit any and every chance you get! It's one of my best friend's go-to spots whenever they visit NYC. And it's become my favorite spot ever since. If you have time to read this place's story/history online, you'll fall in love with it even more! The ambiance inside is very chill for intimate moments either as a group or duo. I love the decor inside - it has a Moroccan feel but also with a modern twist. The lighting itself adds to the ambiance and sets the mood for any occasion. The service was great despite one server who seemed a little off. I didn't really pay attention to it but noticed it a few times but that didn't stop the great service we got overall. The food came out in an efficient manner.As for the food, I can go on and on about the dishes and wish I took better pictures of what we ordered but it was difficult with the lighting and I was just truly hungry. We ordered a variety of cocktails off their menu which were quite delicious and refreshing. I'm not into overly sweet drinks and Cafe Mogador offers drinks that are just right. I always do family style with my friends and we shared a variety of dishes - one of the Mezzes we got was the Tabouli which was refreshing with the cucumber yogurt. We also go the Moraccan Tagines with lamb shank and cous cous and this was just divine!"
469,W4hobe10Fy54MKqmLaObEg,2/21/2023,4 star rating,"Nice Moroccan brunch spot with authentic vibes. I ordered the Moroccan Tagine with couscous and chicken with stewed apricot and prunes sauce ($23). It was good but a bit small and plain. It was basically just a few pieces of chicken with some light sauce to go along with 2 prunes and 3 apricots and a side plate of couscous. The chicken was very tender and tasty though- I just wish there was more. Given the small portion size, this was probably not worth the price, but not too bad of a deal still given the quality. The restaurant itself has some character and authentic Moroccan family-style vibes with family photographs along the walls and some Moroccan decor. The place is decently sized and was busy on a Sunday afternoon, but we were able to get a table for 2 with no reservation or wait. There is a moderate noise level with all the customers in there. The staff were average friendliness and service speed was fine.Overall, I would give Cafe Mogador 3.5 stars if I could for good Moroccan food and nice atmosphere but just not the best value. That being said, given that there are not too many other good Moroccan places around, I will bump up this rating to 4 stars on a Yelp scale. If you're interested in trying out some Moroccan food in a nice environment, I still think Cafe Mogador is a pretty good option."

I love eating mezze, I could have it for a meal. For my entree I got Chicken Tagine and it was fantastic. The chicken was so soft and tender. We had a long wait for our food. All of the tables around us for dinner before we did and then ordered after us. I am pretty sure they forgot about us. They took away the full sauces we paid for when they took our appetizer away from the table. They brought us a drink we didn't order. I'm hoping it was just an off night because this place was soooo delicious."
471,W4hobe10Fy54MKqmLaObEg,4/1/2023,4 star rating,"A solid brunch option in the area. The sabich plate had nice fried eggplant and i like the tahini a lot, it tasted like there was hazelnuts in it? Which was very good. Pretty standard fare that didnt necessarily didnt blow me away (mayb bc theres so many good mediterranean options in philly) but it was a nice meal and i wldnt be mad if i ever had an occasion to go back."
472,W4hobe10Fy54MKqmLaObEg,3/8/2023,4 star rating,"My least favorite dish is the veggie cous cous. To me, it is kinda bland, but I do like the touch of raisins - it really makes it better. I think you can order that with some meat instead of just vegetable only, or order something that has strong seasoning to eat with, like the lamb tagine in the picture. Everything else is delicious!"
473,W4hobe10Fy54MKqmLaObEg,1/14/2023,4 star rating,Fell in love with their ambiance! Cozy cafe tucked away along the 1st avenue. It was crowded on a Saturday night and they don't take reservations. So we had to wait for 45 mins. Order:Falafel with tahini 5/5Veg curry with rice 3/5Kunefe 5/5The Falafel was well cooked and served hot and surprisingly with tahini (sauce prepped out of sesame seeds) instead of hummus and loved the combo. It was filling since they gave 5 pieces. The veg curry was little bland but the quantity was well and good for our party. Loved the kunefe and how soft the cheese base. It was soaked with rose water and loved the taste along with pistachios.Must visit again for its brunch/breakfast!
474,W4hobe10Fy54MKqmLaObEg,12/26/2022,3 star rating,"Short review: Lamb/beef is a lot better than the dry chicken. Merguez is good. Lamb shank is excellent. Mezze are overpriced and alright.I went to this Moroccan place with 5 others around a month ago. We shared a bunch of dishes and left mostly satisfied. Not in the mood for alcohol, I had a mint lemonade which was pretty tasty. The place was crowded and a bit loud and the service was slightly discombobulated.We first split a few mezze. This consisted of hummus, matbucha, and babaganoush. They were each $9 which was pricey for the portion size. The matbucha was my favorite consisting of a spicy tomato paste with some peppers. I've had it before and this was excellent. The hummus was alright as it could have used a stronger base but it had good creaminess. The babaganoush had good smokiness but again I have had much better especially for the price. Not helping the mezze was the cold pita likely store bought.The lamb shank couscous with veggies, caramelized onions, and raisins was a lot better. Perfectly tender lamb cooked down properly and the sauce wasn't overly sweet. Even for $28, I would recommend it heavily. Good stuff.The mixed grill with chicken kebab, sausage (aka merguez,) and kefta kabab with grilled veggies, salad, and basmati rice was $30. Of the three meats, the best by far were the kefta and the merguez. The kefta had soft well flavored meat and was cooked properly (so yet again lamb/beef is the king here.) The merguez, a spiced sausage, was also quite good. I'll echo the other reviews. Nicely spiced though I think a few more pieces would be nice for the price. The chicken was on the dry end and I didn't like it much.The bastilla consisting of filo pastry stuffed with chicken, eggs, almonds, and herbs with spices and a salad served with Casablanca sauce (chickpeas, raisins, and onions) which was $27. I found the filo a bit harder than other spots and the spices were a bit lighter. The sauce on the side was excellent. If you're looking for a better version of this, I would highly recommend La Shuk instead which is temporarily closed.The chicken tagine with our choice of sauce (we went with apricot and prune which is called ""sauce royale in some other spots"") was a bit worse by comparison. The chicken could have used more flavor and the sauce was overly sweet. The fruits also still had pits which made the dish a bit hard to eat. It was alright and cheaper than the lamb at $23The food here was pretty good. I'd probably go back to have brunch here as there was signs of better food but I found the prices a bit high. Around a low 3."
475,W4hobe10Fy54MKqmLaObEg,1/11/2023,4 star rating,Worth trying once. The Bastilla is authentic and tastes similarly to how it tasted when I was in Morocco. The staff and atmosphere is nice. I was very disappointed in the Moroccan tea.
476,W4hobe10Fy54MKqmLaObEg,12/14/2022,4 star rating,"My friend and I ate lunch here on Saturday, November 26, 2022. I got Vegetable couscous, my friend Moroccan eggs, and we shared a large Turkish coffee. I love the texture of couscous. I didn't know what it was so I looked it up and Wikipedia informed me that it is steamed granules of rolled durum wheat semolina. Interesting texture with good amount of seasoning. The vegetables on top were also thoroughly cooked, not mushy but soft and tender. I especially loved the butternut squash. My favorite has to be Moroccan eggs though--would love to get these next time. Cafe Mogador's is the first and only Turkish coffee I've had so I don't know if it is authentic, but I loved it! It is smooth and thick, since it is unfiltered, but the coffee grounds are surprisingly not bitter as when I tasted some accidentally at home."

The restaurant had a cute interior and was not cramped. I got the Middle Eastern Breakfast which had a nice variety of salad, hummus, pita, quinoa and eggs. They let me choose the style of eggs -- I asked for poached -- and they were perfectly done with a slightly gooey center. The pita was flavorful with plenty of herbs sprinkled on top and the hummus was super good too!Although the dish sounded pretty simple, it was well executed and with quick service as well."
478,8ZF3-QQ5ea8zQTeyZ2pIuQ,11/13/2022,5 star rating,"Legit Taiwanese in NYC! 4.25stars and rounded up. One of the best Taiwanese spots in Manhattan (there aren't that many). I've ordered takeout from here a few times, and tried the braised beef noodle soup, braised tomato, beef, tendon and tripe noodle soup, braised kelp knots and braised wood ear mushrooms. I appreciate the authentic flavors and preparations, and the noodle soups are a generous portion at decent prices. In the noodle soup I ate this week the meat, tendon and tripe were super tender. The noodles were perfectly cooked, and I loved that the takeout container had a separate compartment for the noodles so they didn't get soggy. The noodles themselves had good body and both stood up to the soup, and paired well with the heartiness of the meat. My only small gripe is that the soup and overall braised meat are a bit too salty (as most food in NYC is want to be). 25% less salt level in the latest noodle soup would've made the experience even more positive. The first time I had the beef noodle soup I don't recall it being as salty so maybe something to work on with consistency. The braised woodear mushrooms and the kelp knots are a treat--a bit of savory umami with a crunch (balanced with a bit of Chinese vinegar and a hint of chili pepper spice for the woodear mushrooms). I haven't tried the pigs ears yet, but plan to. These specialties really speak to traditional Taiwanese cooking and I love that these items are being represented in the NYC food scene!"

Then we split the popcorn chicken which was pretty disappointing. I don't think I would order that again.My friend got the beef noodle soup, which she said was just average. The broth tasted like it wasnt the delicious kind that would be cooking for hours. My Taiwanese bRaised pork was ok as well. I wish there were more vegetables."

I actually ordered 3 at once for myself, my husband, and a colleague of ours.To be honest, upon opening the container and seeing the noodles, I didn't think I'd like it. I thought it would be impossible for me to separate the noodles in the broth and that by the time I do, it would be all soggy. I was wrong. I really liked my meal!The spice, I feel like they can still kick it up a notch, it did not feel like much for me but it was spicy enough for my husband and colleague.

Popcorn chicken was crispy but you need to ask them for sauce otherwise it would be too dry. Lastly, the braised beef noodle soup was good but wasn't too special.

Me and my friend arrived at 12pm on a Saturday and it was EMPTY :) which was not a problem cause I love having a lot of space! Literally a breath of fresh air We sat indoors though they do have seating outdoors as well.I got the Noodles with Beef & Braised Sauce while my friend got the Spicy Beef & Tendon Noodles Soup. We also got the Taiwanese Luwei Braised Soybean Curd to share.I loved my dish as I was aiming for something not spicy and not needing to deal with hot soup although my friend's dish was served closer to warm than hot. The garlic sauce on top of the beef was not overwhelming and packs the flavor needed to go with the slightly cold beef slices and noodles underneath.I tasted my friend's beef and found it rather gamey compared to mine. She agreed my beef was better. For super spicy eaters, I can confirm through my friend this was not spicy at all.Another friend joined later and got the tomato beef noodle soup which I noticed was served significantly hotter. She said it was good too.They also gave a lot more soybean curd than expected which is always a plus.Would I come again? Absolutely!"

Maybe because of late deliveries which isn't always their delivery people and I dislike when people say they are rude here because the lady behind the counter is very nice and people mix up lack up fluent English with mean and I believe that's the case here.

I added peppers and onions for a couple extra cents and a side of chips and guac (add jalapeños).The guac seemed like they literally threw a handful of jalapeños on top before closing the container. The grilled chicken was thrown into a (premade?) container with rice, black beans and tomatoes. (What if I was allergic??) The food wasn't hot, and hours later when I went back to seamless to review my order and see where I'd gone wrong, the chicken plate no longer existed. Besides the chips, my overall meal experience was beyond disappointing. Not sure why I'm even giving 2 stars bc I'm still hungry..."

The enchiladas were good, but not what  typically get when you order enchiladas. They really reminded me of a Taco Bell chalupa. The seasoned ground beef was very flavorful. I was told guacamole would be served on top but it was not. Rice and beans had a nice flavor. Not too spicy but there was a little after kick.

502,ZeEmlTiSPQCKs9JlC19R6w,6/17/2022,2 star rating,"Have lived in brooklyn for 10 years now and finally made it over to the Brooklyn Inn after years of passing it and saying, ""oh, we should go there"".  Regretted it as the experience flopped big time. Historically and architecturally the bar is cool, later interior work has muddled the charm somewhat but whatever.. especially as this place is in fact a dive bar. Was very surprised as from the outside it seems like some very cosy and atmospheric date-type of bar. Nope, it's a dive bar but with an old echo-ey  interior and smaller pool table in the rear. I was not disappointed by this because I am a big dive bar fan and even named my dog after the best one in the city (not telling you people which one sorry). Anyway, my friends and I played a few rounds of pool and I had a tab open. We decided to head back towards the apartment and stop at some other bars on Smith St along the way so I went to close my tab. For being fairly quiet and not busy for a Saturday night, it sure did take the bar tender with long hair (mentioned in other reviews it seems) to get to me friend. Of course it didn't help that he had to pour some shots and take them with some... how do i say... LES / Lavogirls (regulars ?) at the end of the bar. Whatever, I do shots with bartenders sometimes too. He hands me the clipboard and I get out of the way so my friend can grab the bar tender before he goes MIA again. Also people are itching to order drinks. Right away I'm confused because my credit card is not in with my receipt under the clip. I look around the floor and bar counter real quick to see it it somehow fell... and nope nowhere to be found. I habitually sign the receipt and tip $7 on my $33 bill because I'm that kind of person and inflation, right? Welp, regrettable decision as when I finally get a hold of the bar tender again who at this point is quite obviously avoiding me... I ask if he still had my card because it wasn't with my receipt. He goes, ""uhhhh, i can  check back here"" and he looks at whatever it by the register. Of course, no luck, I have already turned my flashlight on and searched around the bar and my pockets, wallet etc. Nope, I do not have my card visa ending in XXXX and I know at this point I never got it back from him. I never saw it or felt it when I got the clip-board. I go back to my friends and they're like ""you didn't give the signed receipt back, did you?"" and unfortunately I had fully expecting my card to be found and returned to me. Honestly I just didn't care to pursue it further and had already put a block on my card to later cancel it. My boyfriend was p**sed to say the least and went up to ask where my credit card was and why I was still charged if he lost or gave away my card. Bar tender gets defensive and then changes his story to, ""I gave him the card and he must have lost it""..... ""this happens all the time"" (yikes). This guy was so dismissive and passive aggressive to my boyfriend and then began implying I was drunk and lost my own credit card somehow which made absolutely no sense. Not only that but he said this as if I wasn't right there next to him. I am very patient and understanding but when someone crosses a line and starts to disrespect my boyfriend in front of the bar because of THEIR OWN MISTAKE... I have to chime in. I tell him why don't you just own that you managed to lose or give away my credit card.... why lie and say you gave it to me and that I'm drunk.... I had an old fashioned and a beer over the course of 2.5 hours. Long hair bar tender then decides to tell my boyfriend to leave the bar. At that point I was alike, F this... and emptied the contents of my wallet onto the bar and calmly went through each item aloud. Ending with, ""Hmmm, no USAA Platinum Visa Cash Rewards Card ending in XXXX .....must have disappeared into thin air because I'm so drunk."". Like please, just take responsibility and apologize and I'll cancel my card and be on with my life. No apology.. just sass and slander from long hair don't care bartender bro. Maybe it's because we're a gay couple and he thinks we won't say something? I have to wonder especially at the beginning of Pride Month. Anyway, couldn't dispute the charge like I promised the bar tender because I had signed the receipt. Long hair don't care bar tender bro even added in that $7 tip too!  Oy vey. Take notes brah, standard practice to to not charge someone when you lose their card... even more so don't charge them and still add the tip.PS: Source close to the owner informed me that the bad bar tender's name is Danny and he is, ""always drunk"". I kid you not. Well there yah go folks. Jesus what ride. I would skip unless you feel like sparring with long hair don't care ding dong or actively avoid ordering from him. Probably just go to literally any other bar in the neighborhood/city."

So I decided to get a tasty hot toddy which was perfect! It great this bar was able to pivot during a difficult time, thankful for the change to visit and can't wait to go back again."

I've gone three times in the past few months and everytime I've gone there's been something wrong with my food/the quality of food isn't the same xOn one instance I went to get the breakfast scramble, the guy repeated my order back to me I asked for a bowl he gave me a wrap. Another instance I ordered the lavendar matcha drink because the girl raved about it. I get the drink, hadnt stated drinking it yet and the guy came back and said we need to finish it. The girl said she could spell that the lavendar hasn't been added. On that same instance I get home to find that avocado I asked for wasn't included. When I went back three tiny slices were added so I had to ask for more. If you see my breakfast scramble I recently posted vs the past scramble I posted you can clearly see the decline in food amount. Also the avocado looks like that because I had to ask for more. I keep going back because I'm hoping it'll get better but I'm realizing I had to face reality that it won't."

He is a really nice guy as are all of the employees that I've experienced. They are well versed on the menu including all of the coffee choices that can be overwhelming for some.  And they have great coffee and DOPE food some with veggie options. Pictures is the iced coffee with milk and hazelnut- BOMB! For my meal I got the bahn mi with veggie meat again- BOMB! Stay local, stay small business and this is also a minority owned business.

I challenge anyone to follow me lead :) I travel often across the boroughs and up and down Long Island so whenever I have a chance to check out a new coffee or cafe, I jump on it! I found them on Yelp and as soon as I walked through the door, was greeting by two friendly folks with big hearts and big smiles. There's seating for about 16 inside with plenty of desk space and elbow space for your laptop, a coffee, and a delicious snack. With the help of the owner, I decided on a cold brew (no milk for me or sugar.. it was delicious!) and the pickled jalapeño, red onion, and tomato avocado toast + egg (also delicious!). The space feels so comfortable and homely. It's pretty hot outside right now but the combination of a/c and the fresh succulents placed about make this place the perfect refuge from the heat.

Also, always on the lookout for sourdough pizza, I emailed them and received a quick response that their pizza was in fact sourdough. We arrived right on time with our reservation and were very kindly greeted and shown to our seat. (The employee said that he moved us to a more comfortable option.) He also offered to take our coats, to which I obliged. The server was very nice and ran through the specials. They sounded great, but we had mostly decided in advance on the artichoke and the fig and prosciutto pizza. When running through recommendations (at our request), she said the striped bass piccata was a popular dish. We added that. (and a Birra Morretti,) The artichokes were divine! The pizza was also fantastic - larger than we expected. The bass was probably a 3.5 stars for us - my wife's first bite had bones in it. I wouldn't say that I loved any bites until my final one. It wasn't bad, just not great. Maybe it could have used a bit more sauce? I wouldn't order it again, but I a) don't order striped bass much and b) am open to ours being a one-off of not-greatness. In other words, I wouldn't discourage someone else from trying it if they are excited. Definitely squeeze the lemon all over it if do. Overall, 5 stars. It feels like a diamond in the rough in the neighborhood. Great staff, very cozy, and the perfect spot for a date."

This spot is one of the best in all of downtown/Fidi area. I have to caveat that haven't been back since pre-pandemic, and am happy to see that it is still thriving. We went with a huge group to celebrate a birthday, ordered a la carte (which looking back at it, not sure if it was a good idea, they offered an $85 per person family style dinner menu). Next time I would opt to do this choice. Nonetheless, we ordered multiple dishes of apps and entrees. Some of the highlights to the apps were the crispy calamari and arancini, also got the octopus (Polpo), which was very interesting, it was not a typical polpo dish you'd expect, it had stuffing. For entree, ordered the Veal Milanese, which was huge and should be shared. I had a piece that was still very pink inside, I am not convinced it should be like this. My favorite was the broccoli rabe side dish, was very tender and delicious!   Overall, a few misses, but decent food and great crowd."

It was very doughy and overwhelming, and just not flavorful considering the amount of mushroom on it. The rib eye seemed good but was very rare for a medium rare - the kitchen was able to pop it back in the oven for us. The squid ink pasta also lacked some flavor, and the chicken marsala was just a tad too salty. The interior is beautiful but the experience was far from perfect as the waitress came up to the table announcing that the cake we had brought would have a cake cutting fee. We had discreetly informed the hostess about the surprise and they had said they could include a sparkler which was nice but the surprise was basically ruined. Likely will not be back."

Then more people came and the manager told people to step up and it took a while for them to be helped as well, to the point that the woman behind me complained. Creating my salad was also complicated.  The woman helping me didn't seem to know where things were and kept having to ask for help.  I also got a slip (which the person checking me out seemed frustrated that I asked for), and it was not even filled remotely to the top (and was charged $4 for this!). The cashier also didn't put silverware / napkins in the bag, and when I asked for some she got aggressive with me that they were already in the bag, to the point she grabbed the bag from me and checked herself before giving a forkMoral of the story, don't go here.

When it's just a paycheck, I know it's not much of anything... but a smile could help. If you're helping someone in front of me, don't tell them to move because they're in my way and don't get nasty with me when I mishear you. You talk so low and you mumble your words, so I can barely hear a thing. And the rolling of your eyes? Come on now. Don't be like that.I usually give fast food workers a break because working in environments like that isn't fun, but at least try. Don't bring your personal business to work."

They are very responsible, kind, and have never messed up my order the multiple times I have been there. The lines move very quick and efficiently.  Standard burger king menu: Obviously you come here for that unhealthy, oily, indulgence and you probably know what you want considering it is burger king. You should really step out of the comfort zone and try some red velvet shake. I'm a big fan of there mozzarella sticks and apple pies. Always efficient, close to Medgar Evars college, Definitely will return."
619,AvZwAxrcHpR7y7JdI-kLHA,1/5/2020,5 star rating,I've never had an issue here. Also they play RnB music. And sometimes they're friendly and nice. Most the time they are just working and keeping it moving. The music is good and they've never messed up an order. Also usually very short waits inside.

A good friend of mine and his mother and grandmother used to come here for early brunches back in the days and they'd made some incredible memories.I too wanted to experience such greatness so I'd visited with that friend and his son. We came here for an early brunch on a Saturday afternoon and it was amazing. This place is so cute and literally reminds me of a family oriented atmosphere. You can immediately tell how personal things will get.We sat in a booth and I'd of course ordered scrambled eggs with hash brown. And to top it off I also had a corn muffin toasted with some strawberry jelly spread on it. Yummy!And get this there is something about the cawfee in the Bronx that'll left you wanting more. I'm not sure what it is, but I was a bit greedy and got myself two cups. It was really nice to have brunch at a local restaurant in the Bronx. I missed these types of authentic experiences.If you find yourself in the Bronx, I'd highly recommend scoping out this place. Be safe!"

This is not the fault of the cook, or delivery persons.  I'm saying this to say, if you are in the business of working with the public, stop rushing, put your heart into it or take a walk... For the establishment you work for, this is unacceptable, Do better!"

If you're there early they make The Best cinnamon buns. Light as air and not too sweet. It puts Cinnabon to shame. The professionals from the VA and nursing homes eat here, so it can't be bad. If you ask for a medium burger, that's what you get. Not a dried out piece of shoe leather."
626,QtkvaNdSb6eTbsOwOzID9g,6/8/2018,1 star rating,"DINNERS AND CROOKSThe food is okey. The huge problem is their billing. I ordered a chicken mushroom wrap for 8.95 including the french fries (which has been said in the menu) and they charged me $11. I was thinking to myself, what is this a 3 dollar tax? I only had a 10 dollar bill. I told them that in the menu it clearly says that its 8.95 including the fries. What they told me was just for you $10 dollars. I was furious but I let it be. A few months later my dad took me to this place again. I ordered the same wrap. Now they charged us 9.95 when it still says 8.95. They said it was their fault and they gave an extra dollar back. But when my father said thats not right. Then they started saying it was because of the tax. Which clearly makes no sense. The tax and the food price is separated not together. Which in the receipt it shows that the tax was separated.PLEASE CHECK YOUR RECEIPT and THE PRICE IN THE MENU IF IT ADDS UP. JUST IN CASE."

Expected delivery was 630pm. Understanding the rainy weather and the fact that they tend to take a long time, I gave them till 715 to call and follow up. I called the restaurant for more than twenty minutes and nobody answered. Nobody called me, emailed me or updated the app. I called customer care and they finally just canceled the order and are refunding the cost. That finically got done at 830, three hours after I ordered. I will never order from them again. There was zero communication and I was hungry and so frustrated by the end."

Anyway, I decided to select lamb over rice (which wasn't pilau since I had inquired as to whether or not it was available at the moment to which the employee said no.) The preparation time was not excessive and I noticed that the atmosphere was soothing. When I received the dish, the lamb produced a  taste that leaned toward salty rather than savory, however, the rice quality was impressive because it was chewy, but not watery. I had requested naan which was enjoyable because I selected the butter option so it was sizzling and fresh. I would recommend this restaurant because of it's late night operation and caring staff."

Shandar has been around this area long enough to pique my curiosity and I knew I had to give them a shot.The first time I was extremely not-sober and succumbed to my inner desires of having abundant mounds of desi delights at my disposal sounded like a great way to end my night. After stuffing my face with some aloo paratha, plain biriyani, and curry goat, I wasn't too impressed with the flavor but it got the cravings out of the way.The last time was a free for all of various things; which meant I could order whatever I wanted for a group of 8. I went with some chana masala, palak paneer, chicken biriyani, aloo gosht, chicken korma, and some good ol keema mutter. We had a nice bundle of rice and garlic naan to go with it. Most of us found the food to be just ok and it was hard to pick a standout dish despite all the variety. The good thing was that the food was super inexpensive and while I appreciated that they had everything I ordered, I hated the fact they packed everything and then threw it in a microwave. For some items, there were sparks flying due to the tin foil, but the staff didn't seem to care too much.I'm not sure if I'd give them another go, but if it's 3AM and i'm out of options, I'm sure there could be worse out there.

The chicken kabab was too plain. The naan sucked because it was dry and not hot, doughy taste. The parata was high but wasn't tasty. And the shabji carrots and potato was tasteless. Only the Chana daal was okay. Everything else sucked. The service was terrible because the old lady who took my order. First brought the Chana daal and shabji and no naan or parata to eat it with .

I had gotten mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, broccoli, cauliflower, shredded carrots, parmesan cheese with salmon & caesar dressing. It was very good & fulfilling. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because I felt the salmon piece was pretty small, but outside of that it was a good salad.

I thought it was chicken noodle soup so I was pretty disappointed. That was my fault. However, the soup tasted very grainy and weird. The slither of bread was off putting to me. I couldn't stomach any of the soup until later. Same goes for the toast. I think it's more of an acquired taste. The tomatoes are very sour so it took me a few bites to get used to the combination and actually enjoy it. I don't think i'd reorder those options again."

I was personally exhausted by the limited amount of options if you want to eat healthy, so Over Greens is a god send. I have frequented a few times, and just yesterday visited and decided to leave a review for this great business. I ordered a protein smoothie, Ceasar salad wrap and the tomato soup. Everything was extremely fresh to order and the soup was delicious! Not acidic and very palatable. The service is great and the staff is friendly and takes their time. You have so many options here- make your own smoothie/juice/shake, build your own salad or buy their pre made options, make your own acai bowl. Tons of healthy beverages to chose from - coconut water, to kombucha and anything else you would generally see in a health food store. Amongst this strip of Emmons ave and sheepshead bay road, there are a few other health food stores which orient towards a similar style of food, but since this place is new and offers lots of more mix ins and customization, I honestly prefer it and think it's probably the best place in the neighborhood!! Highly recommend for anyone who is into sweetgreen or DIG and stores of the like! The inside is lovely as there is a gorgeous mural on the wall and it's exceptionally clean. Love it"

Barbecue chicken specifically, they just cover it with sauce and think it's fine like that. Today I ordered kale Caesar salad, and it was just so bad I couldn't eat it. Only 5% was kale, the rest they just put lettuce( which was already bad, soggy and yellow), cheese had probably gone bad too already because it had this weird sour taste, the chicken was so bad I almost threw up.

Ordered a very common shot of Ginger, Lemon & Cayenne. He asked 1oz or 2oz and we said 2oz please. The shots were given to us with no lemon or cayenne, and it was clearly extremely diluted ginger (tasted like half water and half expired ginger root, not fresh at all). Innocent Yesterday and Snob Health on 2nd Ave have AWESOME fresh ginger shots. Also Pressed on Lexington has bottled ginger shots that are way better as well. Case in point, go elsewhere!"

So far, I've only been to Beach Bistro 96 which as some nice staff. I got a caju (cashew) juice to go as I was going to the bus first. For those who haven't had cashew fruit, it has a very strong tropical fruit flavor (like an overripe mango and passion fruit) and it makes a refreshing tart drink.In terms of actual food, I've had a picanha sandwich as their feijoada is a bit pricey. Picanha is a steak cut from the fat cap and it's mostly well known in Brazil/Argentina. It has a slight chew to it but there is a strong delicious beef flavor. The bread had some crunch and there was some lettuce and onions on top. The sandwich was good and worth it (though it had to be at $18.) Good place."

So early, the Hawaiian Chicken wasn't ready yet. I would like to try it next time. The chef/owner was very nice and gave me some complimentary pineapple yogurt. I had to settle for the French roasted chicken which was delicious. The chimichurri sauce was excellent and very fresh. To call a sauce a ""side"" is silly. The Kale Caesar side salad was terrible but I'm chalking it up to them working out the kinks. Big pieces of Kale, no dressing but the generous slices of cheese and perfectly cooked hard boiled egg made up for it. Nice selection of food ranging from Spanish, Mexican, Asian, French and bakery. And the space is gorgeous. Hip furnishings in the ""living room"" area. The bathroom is also especially pretty with granite sinks. My husband was wondering how they will keep the homeless out of the locked bathrooms. I hope they can maintain this lovely space.  Once people start finding out about it and it becomes more popular, it can sometimes be hard to maintain. Oh and the cleanup staff were well attired in Art Deco uniforms and they were very friendly and quick. It's pricey but no more pricey than the Pennsy Food Hall down by Penn Station  and WAAAY better. My chicken thigh with side salad and sauce was $15. The quality of food is excellent though and I wish the Deco Food Hall much success."

It is well balanced. It has just the right mix of feminine and masculine touches and the bar in the middle looks like it's straight out of the 40s. I can't wait for the bar in the middle to open so that I can grace it with my presence. I also liked that during lunch time it was super easy to walk in and get a table. It's also obviously phenomenal that there are so many different choices and places to eat. I went to lunch with a friend of mine who has a small baby and we fit right in even though most of the people in there looked like they worked at a tech company.

Everything was just right - the level of savory, sweet, spice, oil - it was all a perfect balance.  The service was also great. While I was waiting for my order, the staff was very friendly and accommodating, allowing me to sit by the bar area and even offering me water. The order was neatly packaged with nothing lacking. I'd asked to keep ingredients separated to avoid my meal getting soggy. They didn't skimp on ingredients, and they did a great job with keeping everything clean and tidy with no spills, which I really appreciate, especially when you've experienced messy take-out orders who use it as a chance to save a dollar or two.Coming from Elmhurst, Queens, where there's an abundance of great Thai restaurants, I was a bit skeptical at first when seeing the higher prices.

The ambiance of the restaurant transported me to a bustling diner with Thai-inspired decor, creating a unique and welcoming atmosphere. We started off with the Thai Disco Fries, which were a delicious twist on classic diner fries, drenched in curry and perfectly crispy. For the main course, I had the Pad See Ew with fried chicken and the Crab Fried Rice, both of which were exceptional. The Pad See Ew was the standout dish for me, as the crispy and savory fried chicken paired perfectly with the sweet tanginess of the dish. The menu was unique and unlike any other Thai restaurant I have visited, with dishes like Khao Soi and Beef Short Rib Basil. I appreciate the restaurant's creativity in bringing Thai cuisine to a diner format. Though the tables can be a bit snug, the heat lamps were a nice touch and added to the cozy ambiance of the restaurant. Overall, I do recommend Thai Diner to anyone in the Nolita area for a delicious Thai dining experience."

That's always a good sign.So we ordered a few items: Thai iced tea, their baked clams, papaya salad, the roti, lobster omelette, sticky rice, and dessert was warm sticky rice with mangoAll the food was really good. It was probably my favorite papaya salad. Considering I spent about a month in Thailand... I feel that's saying a lot. The Thai iced tea was okay but I've had better. The lobster omelette was pretty good except our lobster was a bit overcooked so it was slightly rubbery. The clams were really good. the roti was yummy and a little flaky. I had to go with the traditional dessert that you'll see everywhere in Thailand. Next time my friend said to try the coconut Sunday.Service was right on point. We sat down at the bar so someone was always waiting to help us."

We arrived around 12:30ish on a Saturday afternoon with no reservations, but fortunately got seated in less than 5 minutes. It's a bit loud, but has really good energy. Service was friendly and efficient. Here's what we ordered: - Thai diner egg sandwich: This was definitely an upgrade to my typical breakfast sandwich. The roti is thin so it was hard to eat it like an actual sandwich/wrap but I loved the flavor. - Kaieng kieow waan (green curry braised duck leg): Duck is usually a hit or miss but this dish was my dad's favorite. Sometimes duck can taste too game-y or tough but that wasn't the case at all. It paired really nicely with the green curry, which was fragrant but not overpowering. - Thai tea babka french toast: This was my personal favorite. It came with a side of thai tea butter and salted condensed milk. The thai tea flavor came across surprisingly well. I would order this again! The desserts looked delicious but we were unfortunately quite full. Something to save for next time!"
677,XgiG7K7ubHsj2JJ-c2sXnw,3/6/2023,5 star rating,"I came here twice so far and had a fantastic experience both times. During my first visit, I looked forward to trying the Thai Tea Babka French Toast the most, but I learned that I wasn't a big fan of babka. Still, it was cool to try because it was the first time I had french toast with mini dragon fruit toppings. The dish also had condensed milk and thai tea butter on the side, but I've had something like that in the past so I wasn't too amazed. I also selected another breakfast item: The Thai Diner Egg Sandwich ($14). It was unique in that the roti replaced the bread that's usually seen in typical sandwiches. It also came with a dipping sauce! Sadly, it wasn't too memorable. My husband got the Khao Soi Kaa Kai ($23) - noodles in thick curry broth with a juicy chicken leg and other good stuff. That was the clear winner that day. So when I came back for a second time, I made sure to get the Khao Soi and it was just as delicious as I remembered it to be! However, the Disco Fries ($13) were even better! The fries were loaded with crushed peanuts, scallions, and !! coconut cream!!. There was a pool of curry underneath the fries. It reminded me of poutine and it was so good. Kind of spicy too. I was disappointed that the Thai Iced Tea ($4) was small in portion, so I don't recommend ordering that because I felt scammed. The first time I ate here, I sat inside the restaurant and it felt a bit cramped. The second time was inside their outdoor dining structure. It was cramped but more built out than some other dining structures, so it felt like I was having lunch inside a train almost. I liked how they cracked the windows open for some air ventilation. Be prepared to wait for a table! The upside is that you can leave your number and then take a walk around until they contact you when your table's ready."
678,XgiG7K7ubHsj2JJ-c2sXnw,3/2/2023,4 star rating,"Make sure to get a reservation for this place! I put my name on the list Sunday afternoon around 12 and waited about 40 minutes for a table. We were seated in the enclosed outdoor dining space at a very awkward and tiny table for 2. The room was well heated so it definitely was warm inside. We ordered a thai iced tea and the size of the drink was so tiny compared to other thai places. We ordered the disco fries as an appetizer and they were so good!! We didn't realize until half way through that the curry was on the bottom so make sure to mix all that around. I loved the idea of curry with fries but I do think that it made the fries pretty soggy at the end. I loved the spicy kick but I think I'd prefer a thicker curry sauce for the fries. We got the Thai tea French toast- so good! Anything Thai tea, count me in! So sweet and rich, perfect for my sweet tooth. We also ordered a hamburger called Phat Bai Horapha. It was a Thai style beef burger topped with an egg. Definitely very messy, especially with the sauce but the flavor was very unique and the basil really comes through. I loved the food here but I feel that the service wasn't the best. I felt rushed while I was eating and rarely got my water filled. I'd definitely come back for the unique dining experience though. Everything on the menu looks super interesting and new to me."
679,XgiG7K7ubHsj2JJ-c2sXnw,3/10/2023,5 star rating,This place let me charge my dead phone I was so grateful. Ambiance was lovely. We sat the one of the window tables where it was bright but when you go to the inner seats the lighting is dimmed out with louder music. The toast with Thai butter was so savory. Phat see ew was a little different from other places where it was slightly bitter from the vegetables. The burger had a lot going on. I could taste fish sauce and the burger itself was unique but too greasy for my liking. The shots were strong!
680,XgiG7K7ubHsj2JJ-c2sXnw,2/28/2023,5 star rating,"Great Thai place so it's no wonder why it's always so busy. There were people waiting outside on a Saturday Monday before they even opened!Pad Thai ($22) - with fried chicken. The fried chicken was properly fried so it was quite crispy. It's only a one dollar difference with regular chicken so it's very worth it. The noodles had great flavor - they were also tossed with small dried fish, which gave the dish more umami and texture. Service was great and the interior was decked out with Thai things. It certainly mixed the idea of a diner with Thai quite well. The menu is also quite extensive, with a blend of American and Thai inspired foods."
681,XgiG7K7ubHsj2JJ-c2sXnw,2/9/2023,5 star rating,"Some of the best Thai food I've had. Came here on a Saturday around 11:45 and there was a 20 minute wait. When we left, there was a much longer line, so I would encourage you to either get a reservation or come earlier. We got the following for the four of us:Thai Tea Babka French toast: this was delicious. It had a Thai tea butter, condensed milk, and dragon fruit on top of a  rich babka that came in four pieces. Laab with fried chicken: you have the choice of also getting mushrooms or minced pork, but I think fried chicken is the right call. The dressing had a slightly sour/spicy taste which was interesting and it also came with sticky rice. This was my favorite dish. Kaeng Kieow Waan: this was a duck leg with  rice noodles and a green curry sauce that wasn't too spicy. My friends all loved this one. Crab fried rice: good dish to have as a side. They included a spicy sauce on the side if you want to up the ante, but the rice also has enough flavor on its own. Ice cream sundae: this popped up as one of the best desserts in New York according to the Infatuation, and though it was good, I don't see how this would be any different from other sundaes. There was a ton of whipped cream on top (more so than the coconut gelato) and it came with candied peanuts and toasted coconut. Indoor and enclosed outdoor seating available. Two single occupant restrooms available inside. Up to two credit cards accepted per table."

We had the following catered to my office: -an assortment of wraps-chicken avocado salad (one party-sized box)-an assortment of cookiesI personally tried the spicy black bean and mango wrap and did not like it.

The wrap size is pretty small and the full wrap would not have kept me full.I really enjoyed the salad until I discovered my little dead friend. The salad was lettuce, cranberries, grilled chicken, avocado, walnuts, and cherry tomatoes. No dressing was included. I think Pret forgot to provide dressing. So my coworkers and I scrambled to find some leftover dressing in the fridge. I was almost done with my salad and I noticed the fly. I lost my appetite immediately, but thankfully I was pretty full anyway. I find it unacceptable to find bugs in the food. Who would want to eat here again??I sampled some of the cookies, which were still warm when we received them. We had chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, and double chocolate chip.

With so many chains in NYC and obvious low quality, why do people keep eating here?This was my first time trying Pret and definitely my last time. We had the following catered to my office: -an assortment of wraps-chicken avocado salad (one party-sized box)-an assortment of cookiesI personally tried the spicy black bean and mango wrap and did not like it. I'm normally like this combination but something about the black beans was off-putting so I only ate half the wrap. The wrap size is pretty small and the full wrap would not have kept me full.I really enjoyed the salad until I discovered my little dead friend. The salad was lettuce, cranberries, grilled chicken, avocado, walnuts, and cherry tomatoes. No dressing was included. I think Pret forgot to provide dressing. So my coworkers and I scrambled to find some leftover dressing in the fridge. I was almost done with my salad and I noticed the fly. I lost my appetite immediately, but thankfully I was pretty full anyway. I find it unacceptable to find bugs in the food. Who would want to eat here again??I sampled some of the cookies, which were still warm when we received them. We had chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, and double chocolate chip. While I really loved the cookies, they don't make up for a horrible meal.Overall, this chain is mediocre food and I regret wasting my calories here."

The chicken was great~! Even though it wasn't as crispy like most typical dishes, it had great seasoning to it that wasn't too sweet or salty. Plus, the fresh steamed broccoli helped balanced out the meal too. As for the eggplants, this was quite different. A bit chewy, sweet, and spicy with a hint of garlic, this is definitely something I wouldn't have thought of trying. It's a unique taste and I do recommend trying it if you're in the mood for something new. Also, this place is family style, so be prepare for big portions to share with people.I will say, this is one of the yummiest Cantonese restaurants I have been to.

The owners are incredibly nice, but the waiter, Ming needs a little work though. He makes faces if he sees you tipping low.. but aside from that, you must try this place! I recommend their steam fish, shrimp with walnut, and ox tail  my mouth is watering just thinking about it. There's plenty of options to chose from and they are willing to customize it for you.

Traveling to places like Hong Kong and China where the wok is a very popular cooking tool for a lot of things I believe the chief  may be from the main land from the taste of the food. They don't speak much English but they're able to take your order if you point at the menu.

I built my own bowl with mixed greens, chickpea salad, falafel, various veggies, and hummus. The toppings were loaded with multi-ingredient options counting as one choice. The vegetarian bowl price is a tiny bit higher than vegetarian Chipotle, but in my opinion it's worth it if you're in the mood for something more Mediterranean. Everything is super flavorful and combined well. The service was super nice and I had about half leftover, making it a great value. I'm definitely adding this one to the roster!"

Each gyro was around $14, which seemed pretty average for the amount of food. The chicken gyro was a little dry, and the baklava wasn't too great, but the lamb gyro was really delicious, honestly one of the best gyros I've ever had. The meat was super soft and tender with a great smokey flavor, and it was perfectly complimented by the creamy tzatziki and tangy pickled tomatoes and cucumbers.

There's a great variety of protein options and all of them very delicious. My favorites are the yeero (they don't skimp!!), chickpea salad, and lemon potatos. Richard is very very nice. Only issue so far is that i ordered brown rice and the female associate was scraping the bottom of the container. It ended up being hard and crunchy. I didn't speak up but definitely should have."

Personally, I get either the mixed greens or rice. Once you move onto proteins and sides, it's a myriad of Mediterranean deliciousness. My preference is half lamb or chicken with half falafel - best of both worlds. Add their chickpeas and Greek salad along with hummus (spicy or regular) and tzatziki sauce and it's an incredible plate. They definitely don't skimp on portions either! Highly recommend."

Prices are pretty decent too considering Kips Bay/Manhattan."

790,jCRblp7F5IbUSySK_Y7Qiw,4/20/2022,1 star rating,"Worst portions especially after raising prices!!! I've addressed it with the associate because it's always the same person. She usually works before 3pm along with a male coworker. Why is it that I get 7 beans when I order the Lima bean option? I usually get a salad with a meat or at times just veggie sides. Why is that individuals ordering rice get 10 pounds of food? She has the audacity to tell me that'll be an extra side because I ask for more beans!!! I got 7 beans...really!!!! On the other hand, the wraps are stuffed with food. I wish I can speak to a manager because this is an ongoing issue and unfair!!!"

I see a lot of people are comparing this with Chipotle with a Greek twist to it which is partly true but I want to add, the options, quality, and taste of the ingredients is far better than any other major chain.I love Greek food and have tried a couple of things off their menu and everything is really good and super delicious. I just happen to swap my protein(salmon) with beans, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good those beans were. Love their spicy red tomato-based sauce and mango/habanero sauce which has a nice kick to it.  Staff/Service is great and quick, and this has become my default place to get my greek food fix whenever I'm in the neighborhood. I highly recommend checking this place out."

Sure it may be so, but is it really healthy to go broke paying for this, and then not being able to eat anything. If the food was the greatest, maybe they could make an argument. This is good but it's no longer unique. I had the macro bowl. It's about $13 for a small bowl. This came with some kale, rice, and vegetables. By vegetables I mean a carrot. One fucking piece of a carrot is supposed to make me healthy and strong. How about a whole meal? It would be nice to get a meal and not a snack. It also has smoothies but again those are too much, just for fruit. Well it seems the only reasonably priced thing is maybe a cookie, but seriously you need to reconsider your business model, as in do you want to get any business because prices like these are not helping. It sounds like a blast. Get a tiny portion of grains, put a carrot slice on it, and sprinkle a few green leaves on and charge the hell out of them for it. Welcome to Williamsburg."

Everything looked great and I was looking forward to enjoying brunch on one of the bar stools by their floor to ceiling windows. It's a small place but they fit a good amount of seats as well as some tables outside in front of their garden. While my sister and I took a while to decide what we wanted, it was difficult to order once we knew. There was only one worker there as the cook, server, and cashier. When we did finally get a hold of him, he told us that he did not have anymore of both the items we ordered. This was frustrating but then being a fairly new place, I will give them some time to improve their stocking skills. So we changed our order to something they still had ingredients for and ended up having to wait a fairly long time for it to be made. We also ordered the exotic smoothie, which was ready before our food. However, we don't know exactly when it was done because we were never told; it was just left on the counter for us. The smoothie was delicious, though, and had the perfect texture. When we got our food, the worker also came to give us four different baskets of  plastic forks, knives, napkins, and maple syrup. Shouldn't they have all these items in a common area instead of bombarding us with it all at once? Even better, I wish they would use real silverware to not waste the plastic. Or at least they should have recycling available. The food was good but nothing spectacular. I had the tofu scramble with broccoli, carrot sauce, and brown rice. The broccoli kept its nice crunch but the sauce was not that flavorful. My sister got super thick pancakes, which were consequently raw in some areas. We have had pancakes in other places that were deliciously raw-ish but not like this where it is simply pancake batter. She was especially thankful that they were vegan because of this. Yes, there were many downsides to our meal at Juicery Kitchen. But our food was decent and the juice was awesome. The portion sizes and prices are great. Plus, because we were upset about not getting our first choice for our meals, the worker ended up giving us the smoothie for free. Thus, I have a difficult time rating this place.

While the rice and salad were surprisingly well seasoned, the gyro meat was tasteless. And to top it all off, the white sauce was watery and tasteless. You're much better off getting some street meat from a nearby vendor."

The cashier did not let me know the discount option... Also, the fries were not crispy at all. It was almost like the fries were not fully done when sold. Further, the meat has no seasoning. I had to dump hot sauce and salt on it. Overall I think halal guy is better!"

I even got to try babaganush for the first time. My gf who had it tons of times elsewhere said this was one of the better ones she's had. She said it definitely tasted authentic. Very friendly staff.As for seating, it's very limited as it's more of a take out spot. However, my gfs and I were able to grab the seats and enjoy our food right on the spot. We did come off peak hours though, so please keep that in mind.I will be back when I make another trip to NY."

It reminded us of after club days in the Cobblestone streets of Heidelberg. When they showed me their wraps are traditional Turkish (yufka), I decided then to take one wrap to go as I left today. I'm here on this train waiting to get home to devour it. For those unfamiliar with the the spike it's on, they do shave it and cook it to the appropriate temp, so you are never eating undercooked meat. The veggie I got with yesterday's wrap was so fresh, but today. Nothing but meat and sauce. It's gonna be magical! Please don't hesitate, come try it. You won't regret it."

I haven't tried any of the appetizers, so I have yet to report back.  It was packed inside when I arrived with a couple of girlfriends for shots around midnight.  There are big screen televisions with sports games happening.  No world cup yesterday though.  It was basketball and hockey that was on.The music is incredible, and it was my favorite part!   I agree with the other reviews, it is hot in here, yet the name of the spot is oven grill so I'm not surprised.  I found it rather tough to place an order and get the attention of the bartenders.   Maybe because it was hoppin' when we got there.  The staff were kind.  I agree with that part. There is not outdoor drinking, so if you want social distancing, this is not the place for you."
863,PdtLkZMIQBLD8I4B4w7sbg,12/26/2022,1 star rating,"Firstly, I wanted to go about this the subtle way by sending an email about my experience. It has now been over a week and no one has even attempted to reach out. I came with a big group we ordered bottles had a great time. When it was time to leave a server came up to my girlfriend stating that I ordered 7 shots. Firstly, it was not my original server, secondly why go up to my girlfriend saying I ordered something trying to make her pay when I was right there it was all sketchy. I overheard and my girlfriend asked me and I said it wasn't true, I had 2 bottles of agua ardiente on the table why would I order 7 extra shots of the same thing ? And why come up to us when I'm putting my jacket on to leave. I told the server I did not order it and she basically harassed me to pay for it. My friends we're having a great time , it was my girlfriends birthday I didn't want to cause a scene so I just went ahead and paid for it. It just makes me think how many people do they trick this way , when they are drunk and just making them pay for stuff they didn't order especially since the 20% gratuity is included. Just would say to be cautious and weary if you want to come here. I work as a bartender and server myself so it was just disappointing they do these kind of things."

The blackout curtains make it hard to see what's happening from outside but once inside the vibes hit you immediately. This place provides all things needed for a fun Saturday night out, hookah, drinks and music that makes you want to dance!! And the food was pretty good aswell tbh. We ordered the chicken quesadilla (my fav of the night and Im not even a fan of chicken) empanadas and a rice dish pictured below. The management and staff were very friendly and attentive even though the place was packed. All in all we had a great time and would def come back"

I asked one of the server if I need to make a reservation since I want to celebrate my birthday. Staff replied don't need too. So I did not. The day of my celebration February 25, I arrived at 8:30 pm and my families and friends started to arrive as well. A server came to let me know that after 11pm I need to make a bottle purchase and I was okay with it. But it was just 9:00 pm. I started to order side orders food and drinks. But it looks like they have the spot I was sitting on reserved because they didn't want us to stay. I was trying to take the spot for the rest of the night, but they make too many excuses about it. I guess they didn't like the way I arranged the seating because my group was kind of big. My biggest concern about this place is that we were there already consuming but the manager preferred somebody else who wasn't there yet. How you let customers walked away just like that. In an hour we already spent $278 and because of their poor customer service I received, we decided to closed the account and take my business  somewhere else. That's the beauty of NYC you have plenty to choose from. So I won't recommend this establishment for their poor customer service."

It gets over crowded so expect to get touched from time time. The majority of the customers were nice and had manners when it came to asking you to move. However, there was a girl who was just nasty and didn't want to get touch. My friend bumped into her by mistake and she just gave us attitude the whole night. There is so much going on at once!!! We were a party of 6 in a table of 2, and we kept asking if we could move to a bigger table. I am not complaining about us being in a small table because we got there late and that was all that was available. However, later on our waitress gives us a bigger table. . . . And two minutes later we get kicked out. There was miscommunication between our waitress and the manager. One of the gentleman that kicked us out was just rude and thought we were rude for not leaving the table. We did not want to leave because our waitress sat us there. From what I could see, the manager just kept saying ""move them"". I would've appreciated if the manager came up to us and explained that he had already promised the table to another party. After we went back to our small table, the waitress apologized and told us that the bigger table required more consumption. I was annoyed because we were obviously going to keep ordering!!! Anyways the music was super good!! I was jamming to dembow, regeton, spanish trap, r&b and so on. Around 3 am my friend gives the dj $10 so he could put a song. The dj never played it, and when he was asked again by another friend, he denied that the song was ever asked. I guess there was a confusion. Now the bill!!!! The bill was not itemized. We didn't know what we were being charged for. Overall, I'll just go back for the music! It's hard to find places with my type of music. Maybe next time things will be different."

Got the guaco greens salad no avocado. This salad is supposed to come with a jalapeño vinaigrette. This "" jalapeño vinaigrette "" does nothing to your taste buds. Its very citrus-sy ( yeah I made up that word) I was expecting a spice or kick to the vinaigrette. The chicken wasnt dry its roasted. If I come back I will try another salad but definitely with a different vinaigrette."

892,sDgN-TGeEz-wd8kWEUWwTA,10/28/2022,4 star rating,VSPOT is a  Latin vegan chain of casual dining delicious food - the outside looks fairly nondescript and one could walk by without a second look - we'll take a second look because this restaurant has delicious and VERY FRESH vegan food options - did I say FRESH! This was my first time at a VSPOT restaurant and my partner and I really enjoyed it! We were initially put off by the very casual atmosphere as we were celebrating a special occasion but decided to give it a try  Wait staff was friendly and attentive   We shared the nachos supreme appetizer and knew we made the right decision to stay! IT WAS DELICIOUS!  Our main dishes took a while to arrive because they were so fresh! I had the garlic cauliflower burrito and my friend had the chicharron burrito - we were both very pleased and I was especially pleased that the burrito wrap was thin and was not  doughy tasting as I have found with other burritos   Prices are  on the reasonable side  My only reason for not giving it a 5 star is that they need to step up their non alcoholic  beverage menu.  They have a full bar and I enjoyed a beer with my meal but would have preferred a cold non alcoholic kombucha We will definitely return and try out some of the other V SPOT restaurants
893,sDgN-TGeEz-wd8kWEUWwTA,2/15/2023,3 star rating,"Came here 30 mins before closing on a Saturday night . We ordered it to go. You have to do it yourself thru the touchscreen ordering system. I could've dealt without that part. I like the human touch speaking directly with someone.The entire menu is plant based which I loved. I ordered the buffalo strips they were good. We also ordered the "" chicharons"" I was almost fooled. It tasted so realistic. You know it's not pork but the texture was just giving. I also had the Philly empanada that was just ok. Nice flaky crust very buttery. The filling didn't really do it for me. It needed  a bit more seasoning"
894,sDgN-TGeEz-wd8kWEUWwTA,3/19/2023,4 star rating,"It's been a few years since I've visited VSPOT so I was thrilled to come back. My friend and I went here for a midweek dinner date. We went around 7pm and happened to be the only guest sitting to eat. No problem with that, however I felt we could've been greeted/served a bit better. We weren't made aware of the menu / scan to order. Not the biggest of deal since we have been here before, but for someone as their first time it's definitely a red flag. BUT in hindsight the food is amazinggggggg and has not lost its touch! So many items to choose from, and everything is seasoned and cooked so well. Considering it's a vegan (Spanish) restaurant, the food items are definitely reasonable and not too over priced. That part is always a bonus! We ended the night with the best dessert. VSPOT 10/10 recommend"
895,sDgN-TGeEz-wd8kWEUWwTA,3/9/2023,3 star rating,"So I would have liked to give this restaurant 5 stars because the food is 10/10. We got the breaded avocado fries which was out of this world ! It was the right amount of crispy and so fresh. Then we had the empanadas, which was also very yummy as well and filling. The sweet plantain supreme tasted just like a non vegan one which I have had before and love. There was so much flavor and the plantain was just right. My friend got the bandeja paisa, the mini which was ALOT of food. She loved it and said everything tasted amazing. The raspberry cheesecake, was a bit hard but still tasty for a vegan option. If you want yummy out of this world Latin vegan food order from here however DO NOT recommend sitting down for service...as it basically is non-existen. We walked in and it was empty...the one and only ""waiter"" barely acknowledged us as he was busy watching tv. Then after a brief moment said oh sit wherever you want. We proceeded to sit and then he brought two glasses with a bottle of water. After that he went back to watching tv! Lol complete joke and beyond strange ! So after sitting there starring at eachother we figured out that ""oh there is a QR code for the menu"". Their whole setup with this QR code is just strange not not customer service friendly AT ALL. Everything was through the Toastapp...and barely any human interaction. For sure not a place to go on a date or with a group of people...management should seriously work on this."

We were greeted and seated.  They have this really cool feature when ordering and paying your tab  through your phone. We ordered the salsa and chips to start with and margaritas. The chips were warm and soft with  a little crunch. The margaritas were perfect with just enough salt on the rim. For entrees we ordered la Bandeja Paisa which contained chicharrón, red beans, eggs, avocado, sweet plantains, corn arepa and rice and we ordered Lasagna which came surf a Caesar salad. All of the food was delicious but the star of the show was the chicharrón! They were crispy but soft, flavorful and addicting!  Another Vegan restaurant in my books! I will definitely return!"

I had the privilege to sample three empanadas as shown in the pictures attached. They were so flavorful. The sauces and guac was house made ( I would have drank it if no one was watching. Haha!! It was that good. The second dish was Korean Fried Cauliflower. Now this was an explosion in your mouth!! The blend of the sauce with the crispy crunch on the cauliflower...WOW!! Out of bounds!!Must try!!I bragged about it so much another customer waiting to order, also ordered. I will be back!! Great job Enrique!! You Rock!!"

I didn't interact with anyone so I can't speak on that but ordering from the kiosk was easy and it takes card only. Food came out about 15 min later and was still warm when I got home. Everything I ordered was delicious and I have zero regrets choosing this place. The dough of the empanadas was so crispy and light I could talk about it for hours. The fillings were also perfectly seasoned and super filling. I got a rice & beans one + a potato one. The cauliflower was also good but nothing too special. Really enjoyed this for a quick snack.

The peanuts add a nice texture and crunch.  I'm definitely not missing any meat with this cauliflower dish. The chicken fingers do not look like picture and we're hard and tasteless. I'll order again from the V spot but only the cauliflower.

This place is owned and staffed by a Honduran family and their menu is a combination of American food and some Latin specialties. I opted for the Mangu breakfast, which includes eggs, mashed plantains, salami, fried cheese and grilled marinated sweet red onions. I had it without the salami because I am a vegetarian, but not vegan. The meal was tasty and adequate for a big breakfast, brunch, or lunch. I had hot green tea with it.My companion ordered the 1/4 roast chicken, yellow rice with corn,and red beans. Again, very generous, and the chicke had been marinated before baking. Each of these meals was $6...an unbeatable price. They also have special combo meals for families..such as a whole roast chicken, beans, rice, salad and 2-liter soda , for $19.50. The secretary at my doctor's office sometimes gets a special after work and it feeds her,her husband and 2 children. The restaurant is geared to daytime workers..opens Mon.-Fri. 6 AM, closes4:30 PM,closed on weekends. But..they do weekend parties indoors and backyard parties in summer.Nice clean bathroom.

Small but cozy environment, with friendly staff who all make small conversations which makes this experience even more welcoming. Food was fine, it's bar food that's very straightforward. The shrimp and corn croquettes were okay. Highly recommend the fried chicken wings. One thing I really appreciate is that the food is freshly cooked from the kitchen, and is served nice and hot. Though I didn't order as much drinks, the lychee martini was refreshing without having too strong of an alcohol taste. The beer was just beer, it's what I expected."

I'd recommend only coming here with close friends / your significant other because the wait is LONG but totally worth it! We got the omurice (my fav, flavors were delicious but it didn't split open when we sliced through it ), cod roe udon (delicious but very heavy so I'd recommend sharing), and the baked chikuwa (I didn't care for this too much)My friend said the baked brie is a much try so I'll be getting that next time I come!"

Had three glasses of them. Reasonable price.-Okonomiyaki: typical okonomiyaki. Great flavor but a bit overpriced.-Mandarine martini: not the most favorite. Tasted a little bit like a syrup type medicine to me personally but can be your favorite if you like sweet, fruity martini.Overall, great experience."

Def worth going around this time. When we left at 7:30/8, there was a line of 20 people waiting to be seated.I love the intimate feeling of the restaurant and the jazz in the corner is a vibe. I'm so surprised this is in midtown east. A true hidden gem! The food was so good and the drinks were delicious!Definitely recommend & will be back for sure!"
912,l_RAv09V67j-Hm9dyZxWhw,3/21/2023,1 star rating,"It was a Sunday evening and we waited for almost 2 hours to get in. It was freezing cold and it really didn't make sense to make people line up inside. I don't understand why they cannot just take people's name and number. When we finally got in, we were assigned to a table near the restroom (far away from the stage and couldn't see the band at all). The servers were helpful when we requested to change table to the front, and our new spot new the entrance was better, view-wise. Since this is a famous Japanese whisky jazz bar, I went in with a high expectations on Japanese food and jazz music. But neither of them was impressive. The menu was simple and all the food we ordered were just plain. The space was rlly crowded and since the restaurant is underground it was a bit suffocating. Worst of all, the jazz music was not impressive at all and it rlly did not worth the wait."
913,l_RAv09V67j-Hm9dyZxWhw,3/12/2023,5 star rating,"One of the best date night spots in Manhattan. The wait, like other folks said, is the only downside. However, if you go on a weekday (not including Thursday and Friday) or you start lining up at 4:30pm or earlier on weekends, you may not have to wait as long. We went on Friday evening and arrived at 4:55 and was probably the 35th person in line. Doors opened at 5 and we finally got in at 7:15 (they stagger the entrances). When it's cold outside, the heat lamps and benches are reeeaally nice. As of Winter 2023, there is also a cream puff store which is great to pop into while you wait in line. I believe the first set ended at 7, plus that was the two hour max limit for people who arrived first, so a lot of people left between 7-7:15. There's more tables available for parties of 2. I think the best seats available are the ones along the wall next to the bar, where there is a booth on one side and chairs on the other side. That way you can see the whole place, the bartender making drinks, and you're not too close to the music so you can talk and hear each other better. The food was sooooo good. We ordered two cocktails, one glass of sake, spam rice balls, salmon rice balls, corn croquettes, omurice (omelet over rice), and Japanese curry rice. We were so full by the end. I especially loved the spam rice balls and omurice, but honestly everything was so so good. It all came out one after the other, with some mild waits in between which was good so we had time to digest. We ended up staying for almost the full two hours and really had a great time here!"

Tomi Jazz is an intimate basement bar which serves freshly made izakaya food. It's definitely is a cute date spot!One thing we did appreciate was that they offered to move us to a bigger table and we did not feel rushed to leave once seated (also why it takes forever to get inside). As for the drinks and foodLychee martini - on the sweet side and couldn't taste any alcohol even though it was there! Yum!Wasabi octopus - raw octopus that had a strong kick to it from the wasabi, a bit on the smaller sideChicken wings and leg - perfectly seasoned and piping hot! Delicious!Curry croquettes- came out hot and fresh from the kitchen, very creamy and just the right amount of curry insideSeaweed salad - one of our favorites! It was refreshing, chewy, and a good balance to all the fried food. The shiso dressing was incredible *chef's kiss*Mentaiko spaghetti - it was good but we wished we ordered the udon instead which looked like it has better textureOkonomiyaki - came sizzling on a hot plate! Lots of vegetables in it and had good texture, we did wait a good half hour for this which took too long in my opinionOverall we loved the place and would be willing to line up when we come back!"

It's always been hard to find a seat or table with the long lines outside, but my friend and I waited around midnight and found a table in 20 minutes!We were initially sat in the back and moved towards a table in the front, which we enjoyed much better cause we were able to hear the jazz trio. We both enjoyed our cocktails - Zen (matcha vodka based) and Ume Hime (plum wine based) - and the fries were a perfect light complement. Would love to come again and hear the band for a longer time! Note: Small, intimate space / $10 per person charge for life music on weekends"
916,l_RAv09V67j-Hm9dyZxWhw,1/23/2023,5 star rating,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!Don't let the long line discourage you from coming here, but be prepared to wait at least an hour depending on what time you show up. If you want to be one of the first people in line, come ~30 minutes before opening. The line moves kind of slow because they stagger the entrance time since its so small inside. They don't take reservations (and please don't be the person that cuts the line to join your friends in the front...) I came ~15 minutes before opening and there were at least 20 people already waiting in line. Luckily, it wasn't too cold outside, so the wait was fine (they have some benches and heating lamps outside).It's very small inside with communal seating near the jazz band, smaller tables (for like 2 people), bar seating, and some tables in the back for larger grounds. I recommend sitting at the bar because it can get pretty loud next to the band - be sure to check what time the band starts playing! They started playing around 6 PM on a Saturday, but the venue opens at 5 PM. They also charge cover on the weekends. Drinks are very strong but delicious here - I tried the green tea cocktail (pretty strong), but I recommend the lychee martini if you are looking for something sweet and fruity (also doesn't taste like alcohol at all).We had a pretty filling lunch, so we didn't order much food here. We tried the spam rice balls, the corn croquette, and the seafood spaghetti. My favorite of the night was the corn croquette (we ordered it 2x because it was so good!) The spaghetti was good, but I thought it tasted kind of salty near the end. The spam rice balls were fine - it would have tasted better if they pan fried the spam, but they didn't do anything special to it. There is a time limit (I think 2 hours), but I thought it was plenty of time to enjoy the food and music. The server lets you know last call for drinks and the kitchen,  but we didn't feel rushed at all to leave even after we finished our drinks and food. Overall, I highly recommend checking out Tomi Jazz at least once! The service is impeccable and the food is equally delicious, which makes waiting in line worth it. Luckily, they are also on delivery platforms, so if you don't want to wait in line, you can always order the food (and please try the corn croquette and thank me later)."
917,l_RAv09V67j-Hm9dyZxWhw,1/17/2023,4 star rating,"Tip:check the website for when the live jazz band comes. Small speakeasy vibe with pretty good food and great drinks. I came on a regular Monday at 8:30 and waited until 9:45 to be seated. It seems like there's always a literal line waiting for seating outside so it is first come first serve. They do have heat lamps outside which makes the wait a bit more tolerable. The interior of it is dark and small but it has a cozy feel to it and it didn't feel hectic or anything at all. The food prices are pretty good given there's a live jazz band- they didn't upcharge for the jazz music. I highly recommend the shrimp croquettes and the roe spaghetti. Drinks are also averagely priced for New York City. This is a great place to take someone on a date because it was filled with couples and they don't kick you out even after you pay your bill. We sat for an extra hour after paying and they were still attentive with refilling our water. Overall, really cool place. Would be nice if we didn't have to wait in a line outside or if they took reservations or had an online waitlist but I would come again"

Buying drinks was a straight forward process as well.

At one point while we were waiting, a bunch of people ran forward and created a second line next to the original, but then merging in with the original right at the front, which was very upsetting.  People were quite confused as to where the separate line for buying tickets was as opposed to the line for people who already had tickets.  I ordered a hard kombucha once inside, although it was a bit pricey, so I am glad I drank some before arriving. I enjoyed the many different rooms playing different music and having overall different vibes, although my favorite part was the outdoor areas, such as the nice rooftop which had great views."

We were in the smaller rooms, which made the space intimate for fans of Forester. The lighting was great, the presentation was great, the drinks were great, and the atmosphere was pumping!!When you walk in there isn't much of a walkway, you just enter the place which is a room with an elevated stage. The lights were dim and cool. Forester didn't get on till 830pm, and Koiter was on at 730. It was weird to have Koiter parallel to the stage, because when you walk in you absolutely know where to look since there is a stage. But Koiter is a mellow house DJ  that needed his DJ sound system equipment, so I guess there wasn't a place to have it set up without some delay, so he was put at the back of the room. It was sort of funny cuz he made an announcement ""Hey I'm Koiter I'll be opening for Forester.... but I'm back here"" so that was kind of weirdAlso had time to head to the bigger stage where Mind Chatter was performing. Lightshow was awesome and cool to see.As far as the staff here at Elsewhere, everyone was great. I had no complaints. You're going to have a great time here at your concert!"

The croissants were so flaky and soft on the inside. The cookie could be a meal all on its own because of the generous portions of macadamia nuts, almonds, and walnuts in it. This cookie and coffee I'm the morning and you're set til lunch! I didn't stay so can't say how the service is."
929,77Q8n_SSXjhN8m2ypqs0ew,3/11/2023,4 star rating,"I came here to have a late afternoon brunch (?). I ordered the quiche, honey lavender latte, and a handful of pastries.You're supposed to order and find your own seat, but I saw a larger party that was directed to a table and ordered from there. I didn't like how loud it was. I went by myself but I felt like it'll be a struggle to talk with someone sitting across from me. Kudos to this girl reading there. Quiche with mixed greensI don't think quiches can be made fresh since it's baked whole as a pie before getting cut into slices. That being said, I found it longer than expected to get my order. I like how it came out though - warm and cozy and buttery crust. The inside wasn't too plain or too salty. It was slightly burnt but tolerable. I'm surprised how greens needed to be added separately on the side, but I'm glad I got it. The dressing is balsamic vinaigrette but the mustard was quite strong. There were multiple times I had to drink water to wash away the spiciness. Despite that, I liked the freshness of the greens. That alone is worth me getting this add on. Honey lavender latte It was alright. Don't think their coffee is the flavor I like. Lavender came in the form of dried pieces sprinkled at the top. I was debating whether I should eat the bits floating on top. I ended up getting most of them, but I think it would be better to infuse the lavender within it. It was still good to have on the side accompanying my quiche. Pastries: nutty chocolate chip cookie, banana walnut bread, raspberry rose cookie, carrot loaf cakeI generally liked all of them. Maybe raspberry rose cookie was my least favorite. Otherwise I like how all of them weren't too sweet. The mix in ingredients are a good ratio to the flour amount. Flavors were strong and hearty. I think this place is worth coming back but not for sit down."

That's a bit steep but it's fine, I won't be coming here that often so it's justifiable. I found this place through Yelp and I really like the aesthetics. Like most avocado toast, generally around 10-15 bucks, this one didn't really stand out to me. I wanted to try it because I'm a huge fan of salsa/bruschetta. You add that with avocado, even better! But this plate was kinda just meh, basic. As for their iced latte, wow it was strong. Maybe a hint of sweetener would've been better but it was pretty strong. I will say though, their butter croissant was really good. Not sure if it was made in house or elsewhere, but it was delicious. Buttery and flakey, so good! If only they could warm it up, even better. I decided I wanted to try it again the next day before flying out. We got there around 10am and it was packed! I think the setup of this place makes it a bit chaotic since everywhere is so compact! Doesn't help when you're all bundled up taking up more room. They offer both indoor/outdoor dining, I should've done outdoor which was more spacious. Aside from that, I ordered the make your own omelette, ham and cheese croissant, butter croissant and marzipan buttercream latte. The omelette was good, it came with mixed greens with balsamic dressing. The balsamic tasted like they added a bit too much of Dijon mustard, a bit overwhelming for me. The ham and cheese croissant was pretty average, I wouldn't get it again though. I was actually quite surprised about the marzipan buttercream latte. It wasn't too sweet as I anticipated. I would definitely come back to try other items or just grab something quick. I really really like their ceramic mugs, if they only sell them as merchandise! It's nice that they have multiple locations, so check them out if you're near any of their locations."

The salad had great portions and was very well worth the price, it had a great dressing and the salmon was fresh as well as the egg cooked perfectly. The sandwich was great the combination of the vine grate it had with the peppers and chicken and the bread.. a solid choice ! A must try if you are looking for a quick breakfast/ lunch"

This spot genuinely made me feel like I had left the city and I was in a cottage. I got the marzipan buttercream latte for my drink. It was sweet and it had an interesting initial taste. It definitely was not my favorite latte of my trip but it was pretty good. I thought the sprinkles on top were genuinely what made this for me! My mom got the ham croissant and the people at the counter taking our order were so attentive when my mom asked for a more cooked egg. The wait staff also made sure we had everything and were so kind the entire visit!

This cafe operates in a similar way to Starbucks: you order at the cashier and then you go find yourself a table to wait for the food. The part where it differs from Starbucks is the quality of its selection. I've been to multiple Maman locations and have had a variety of their dishes and I can safely say that they've all been delicious. Particularly of note are the lavender latte, tartine au saumon, and their fresh bakery.I will say, though, that if you're going at a busy time (ie Saturday or Sunday brunch) service can be a little slow."

There is very very limited seating, practically 3 stools located at the front of the store.In terms of customer service, they're not the best. We requested very little cream in our coffee and they got it right a third of the time. The donuts look fresh and the munchkins are quite good with a nice selection available. Breakfast croissants are also good and come out hot, especially for the price as they sometimes have promos out.I wouldn't choose to return here, but it's convenient especially when there's very limited time when you're running late in the morning!"

He did this with customers obviously standing right there. His mask also didn't cover his nose.

A manager was NOT readily available and I was running to my place of employment which is in the same neighborhood.  No other customers were in the store at this time either so he was not super busy.

They cool down pretty quickly though so be sure to eat them immediately or they'll harden up. As for the classic cookies (not pictured) they never seem to be hot out the oven (no matter what location you go to--save for 125th). Not sure why that is. Maybe because they're not as pricey as the deluxe ones or because they're free for cookiemagic members. Either way, if it's free it's for me. No complaints here. Glad this location has the mint chocolate cookie as others seem to have it sold out quite often. The employee who helped me was really patient with my questions about my cookiemagic membership and got my cookies boxed up ASAP.

As she was serving the cookie it touched the counter and she gave me a new cookie. Now I did not have to ask and she did not know I noticed but this to me is amazing. I do not like it when my food touches open spaces or my food is touched without gloves etc. The employee who was assisting me was great. So it was a relief when the employee threw the cookie, away and gave me a new one. My cookie was delicious soft and warm."

In the middle of the cashier explaining chipotle rewards to them she asked if I wanted chips and guac. I stated I didn't and waited for her to bag my food. She took my card, swiped it and gave it back. Then continued explaining the rewards to the customers. Still, she didn't place my food in the bag. I waited a few minutes longer for the cashier to bag my food. So I kindly stated hey, I would like this to go. She looked my way and put the food closer to her but didn't place it in the bag. At this point I was upset because I was on my lunch break.

The menu is different with a name change though Ciccio's remains part of it. My sausage slice was nothing like the past and had no sesame seeds at all. The sandwiches were ok but nothing special. There may be new owners or new cooks but this was sadly a turn off. Wish the Ciccio's of old was still in operation.

Also expensive, running with tax like 50-60 bucks. For both probably feeding like 6 people.We have tried the spinach Alfredo pie and it needs something, alone you are overwhelmed by spinach. 3/5 Avoid the Nutella pie. Unless you plan to add some extra toppings of your own it is underwhelming. 2/5 unless you add your own, we did banana slices, nuts, and raspberry drizzle to spice it up.The Parmesan garlic knots are 5/5 amazing. The regular knots are par for the course 3/5"

I brought home the Sophia Loren pie.  After driving an hour back to Jersey, naturally I had to heat the pie up.  Never use a microwave to heart up pizza, everyone knows this.  So just threw a few slices in the toaster oven.  And OMG I was in heaven. The pizza is absolutely delicious.  The sesame seed crust. The sauce is tasty, the fresh tomatoes on there give it a nice extra little pop and texture. and the garlic oh the fresh garlic.  Soooo yummy. I can't wait to go back and try their ciccio pie next."

1043,kn9pSrlttF5R4Re5wcydBA,4/2/2020,4 star rating,"Was scouting Yelp reviews for some quality pizza and decided to give Ciccio's a try.Called at 6:20pm for a Thursday special Chicken Marsala for delivery. The guy on the phone said twenty minutes is their standard delivery time. However, we were waiting for our pizza for an HOUR, so there goes a star, even though if I came to the pizzeria, I might've had a better experience. The address was Ave R, but the guy went to Ave N, which was an additional 15 minute drive to endure. So yeah... Maybe it's the rush hour traffic. Or poor phone connection. Maybe the pizzeria was slammed with orders and deliveries. I was beginning to faint from hunger, when the pizza finally arrived. Cold and sad.After heating it up, we dug in. The crust was surprisingly good even after microwaving. The sesame seeds were an interesting detail [didn't enhance the taste, but was entertaining to crunch on]. The sauce was satisfying, just not too much, or maybe it dried up after all that reheating that we had to do. The toppings were plentiful, so at least glad about that. Wish there was more kick to it--more sauce definitely would've been nice. The pizza was seasoned well--we enjoyed the taste. I was crazy dehydrated afterwards, gulping cold water by the glass so my body could process all the carbs. The price identified online is $25. When I select it online, there are three options--whole pie, right side, and left side. The price automatically jumps to $27 when you select who pie or left side. BUT, if you just select the right side, the price remains at $25. What's the logic here? We paid cash to the delivery boy. $27+tip. Mystery of pricing remains unsolved...We ordered the same pie a few weeks later, and again, it took over 1.5 hours for it to be delivered to our home in Brooklyn. This time, however, it arrived nice and warm. Definitely much tastier than on our first try! Very satisfying, with a good ratio of toppings and sauce. Be weary of the loooong delivery time and plan in advance."

1047,kn9pSrlttF5R4Re5wcydBA,9/4/2021,1 star rating,"I'm a consistent customer when it comes to Ciccios pizza. When I decide to order from their, I always purchase their signature pie the ""Sophia Leone"". I was never disappointed with their ""Sophia Leone"" pie and delivery service only up until today. The ""Sophia Leone"" pie they delivered me this time round didnt have enough marinara sauce, the cheese was extremely burnt, the crust and bottom of the pie were really burnt and there were a lot of burnt bubbles all around the surface of the pizza. I gave the delivery guy a reasonable amount for a tip and he still came an hour and 30 minutes late. When I opened the box, the pizza was very cold, I had to throw the pizza into my stove to heat it up. This whole experience disappointed me enough to make this the last time I place an order from here. You can tell when a pizza pie was made with quality and quantity, this pizza lacked it all."

I ordered the salmon platter, everything was fresh, including the bread which was warm. I enjoyed the variety of sauces they offered with the kebobs. The service was quick and friendly. The ambiance was clean and quiet. I'm giving 5 stars not for the incredible food but also for their amazing 2000s playlist which included Shaggy!"
1049,7UJRw4Klt5yfE7q9vznEHA,12/2/2022,4 star rating,"The Kabob Shack is where you want to go if you want a big banging saucy falafel sandwich with fries. The consistency of the sandwiches has stayed the same in all the years I've been getting them. That goes for the chicken gyro too. The sandwiches are jammed with fresh ingredients and drizzled with their home sauce. Either option, and you're good! Make sure to get the fries. Their fries are addicting. Perfectly skinny and salted. Better than Mcdonald's, and we all know those are crack fries, so are these! Remember to get a sauce or get them all. Their sauces are all great. The only bad thing is they need to do a better job hiring people to take the phone orders. The lack of attention and care is why people have items missing from orders hence negative reviews. After the first couple of times that I noticed the pattern, I stopped calling and will instead go inside to order. The place is small, and even though you rarely see many people inside, they are swamped with to-go orders. So do yourself a favor and go in and order too. The wait is short."

It features chicken, lamb and beef, and I'm particularly impressed by the chicken since I usually have more of a ""bones and all"" preference. And yet if a vegetarian stumbles into this meat emporium, the side dishes are flavor-packed. This isn't a grudging side like KFC's cole slaw. Banjan stars eggplant with help from tomatoes and peppers, and I'm a big admirer of the spinach even if I don't have the details to explain why. It's not just plain old spinach but it's not quite creamed, my uneducated is there's a hit of tomato somewhere but don't quote me."

I ordered the mixed pita chicken and gyro with regular fries and European ketchup, and it was a fantastic combination of flavors. The chicken and gyro were both cooked to perfection and the fries were crispy and tasty honestly they were some of the best fries I ever had! The European ketchup added a nice touch of flavor as well. I also ordered the salmon pita sandwich with sweet potato fries and it was equally delicious. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the flavors in the sandwich went together so well, and the sweet potato fries were a great change from the regular fries. Overall, I highly recommend Kabob Shack for anyone looking for tasty Mediterranean food in Brooklyn."

This little admirable place is the place to be at because of the great taste in food, and generous staff. This gem deserves a drop in so if you happen to be in the area, be sure to stop by, you won't regret it! Best of luck guys, will be back very soon :)"

I'm honestly craving this place so I'll definitely be back often!"

Every time I go here the staff is unapproachable and one gentleman in particular always has a nasty attitude. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt but I've gone here four times and he's been consistently nasty. Ashby's will not be getting my business again."

We also got hot chocolate from Manon Cafe which is just next door and it came with a free chocolate! What a wonderful start of the day :)"

The menu is pretty average and not worth the prices. They don't really have a board with the listed prices and it's frustrating as they ask each other how much things are and then they go on to just charge whatever they want. I paid 7$ for a croissant with butter and 3$ for a bagel with cream cheese. It just doesn't add up at all. It's too early in the morning to question their prices and really low of them to rip people off in a walk in kinda way for just a few bucks. Mannerism is also low in there, they've got a guy in there who walks around like he owns the place, sizing customers up and down."
1064,q3qdUSSnfxuvtD908HOmFA,2/5/2018,2 star rating,I come here for breakfast and lunch often because I work in the equity building and it's nice to not have to physically leave the building to get food (especially in the winter months). The food here is typically a 3 however I have to give them 2 stars because I asked them to toast my chocolate croissant and they completely burned it - the croissant was black.At this point I should just make the effort to find food outside of the building.

Cue: Ashby's! The place is nice inside nothing special but they have a salad, soup, sandwich, and coffee section. I took a look at the menu and saw two sizes of cold brew coffee, a small and large - the large being listed at $2.40 so that what I ordered. The staff member gave me a MASSIVE cup of ice coffee and told me the total was $3.43 I kindly pointed out that it was listed a $2.40 on the menu for a large. She then informed me that's a medium and I repeated that it says a large is $2.40. Needless to say, I got the large for the higher price but come on people get your act together. The least you could do is have the menu board right. Pretty pathetic in my opinion!!!"

Nothing is quite the same as Mamma's cooking but I found the same care and love of cooking at Page Ave Diner! I love everything about the diner. The staff, the owners, and the food. It reminds me of my old Bay Ridge Diner haunts. They really know how to put the entries together. Having said that, just last night I tried the pork chops with portobello mushrooms, which came with vegetables and a baked potato! I have to say it was probably one of the most delicious entrées I have had in quite a while! It was even better than some of the top restaurants I've been to in Brooklyn and Manhattan! I still think about it even to the next day. All I can say is give this Diner a try and you will not forget the experience. Thank you!"

They offer a number of different items from smoothies, juices and much more. They have a bunch of healthy snack options but the ones that caught my eye were the vegan snacks on the counter. They had muffins, cookies, bars and more I couldn't help to but to grab a few of these. The carrot walnut muffin was so good soft and filled with some deliciousness glad I brought 2. I also got the red velvet bunt it looked so good but when we (my daughter and I) actually ate it it was so DRY. Mind you these treats aren't cheap they are $5+ each so I wasn't expecting it to be like this. Overall I would def come back and I'm sure I will be."

Fitrition is one of those places that look like it will be a fixture on Steinway Street for a long while. It is small, but clean and the atmosphere is very appealing. I can't describe what the vibe was exactly, but it was a super chill place. If the store is empty, there is seating in the window space that makes for a great cozy, yet casual afternoon date/outing with a friend. There is even art on the wall that is available for purchase which is a perfect touch to offer guests. I ordered the Queens Bowl and I was very impressed by the presentation and how fresh the ingredients were. Even the aesthetic of the several options offered was very pleasing to the eye and improved the ordering experience. If I am ever in the area, I would come back here if I am ever in the mood for an açaí bowl. Especially on a hot summer day, this is the perfect treat to have when running errands on Steinway."

Plenty of fruit, especially compared to other places I've gone for bowls. It's always amazing, and every time the food and experience has been consistent.But today I did that really annoying thing customers sometimes do, and I asked the employee to try to recreate a shake that I love from another juice place. She could have been so annoyed with me, but was instead super kind and patient as we went thru the ingredients and picked out substitutions for the few items they didn't have. She even let me sample the shake before she poured the whole thing into the cup to make sure I liked it, and asked if I wanted her to add anything else. It was SO good. The only problem is now I'm gonna feel like a douche every time I go in since I'm probably going to keep asking for the same ""secret recipe"" shake.

Then, we ended up waiting for our food for almost 90 minutes since they forgot to put in our orders twice. During the entire time we were waiting, our table wasn't checked on so they didn't realize anything wrong and we had to flag down the waitress for water and status updates after we realized they never put in our order.  Chicken Enchiladas (~$15) - this was pretty good and generously filled with chicken.

Everything here tastes super fresh because it's made in-house. The salsas are amazing. My favorite is the cheese and spinach enchiladas which I get ""Christmas style"", one with red sauce and one with green sauce. My hubby got a burrito and said it was just like the ones he gets in Cali (he goes there for work a lot)."

We stopped into this quaint Tribeca cafe and took a seat on their comfortable covered patio. We started with an order of chips and salsa, which could have been better, and two of their generous margaritas, which were heaven on earth. She had the classic Mexican breakfast plate, with scrambled eggs, potatoes, rice, frijoles, and tortillas, whereas I absolutely had to try the vegan chile verde, served with tortillas, rice, and frijoles. It wasn't Colorado green chile, but close enough for Manhattan. We ended our meal with a couple Modelos, watching the downtown street traffic go by. Lupes is the perfect spot for a taste of home in NYC."

We always order an ""entraña marinera"" ($24 as listed on menu) and ""entraña a la parrilla""($18), this time the skirt steak was literally 1"" inch wide it was so small. We mentioned this to the waitress and she said she had no idea what had happened but that they where usually bigger. As always food was really good. Unfortunately when the check came in I saw that the bill was higher than I had anticipated I asked to see a menu to verify the prices. When the girl ame with the menu she stands there and says that the skirt steaks are overpriced by $4 because these where old menus and they still hadn't gotten the new ones. I explained to her that they can't overcharge people until they put out the new menus or they could have mentioned that before we ordered. She snatched the menu from us and said she wasn't going to argue with us about it. I really don't think that's how she should have handled the situation. So we get smaller portion and are charged more???"

1118,LlPb2VR6eQmxuRXH9oEtkw,1/8/2023,4 star rating,"Variety is still a nice place, but the coffee isn't what it used to be. And the other options in the neighborhood have improved, a lot. The last couple years great drinks have become the exception more than the tule. That goes for espresso drinks as well as drip coffee, the latter used to always be exceptional. Cold brew isn't anything special either.Plus, the signage indicating what coffee they are serving is always no where to be found anymore, and the a lot of the stuff acts like it is an imposition to be asked. Recently the pastry selection has left something to be desired too."
1119,LlPb2VR6eQmxuRXH9oEtkw,1/3/2023,4 star rating,"Solid 4 stars. As soon as I entered this location, it was cozy. Everyone doing their own thing, reading, working, talking. I love that, I quickly found a seat in the back & put my things down and proceeded to the front to order. I ordered a mocha latte, regular milk. To my surprise, the vanilla was an add on, found at the milk counter; close to the garbage and napkins. This was my first time in this cafe, so the lack of menu cafe flavors definitely was a curve ball for me. Nonetheless, mocha latte it was. I was also curious as to why there's no in house cups, for people who don't grab and go, that was another first for me. The actual mocha latte, had a cute heart inside and usually I hate mocha lattes but, I loved this. The taste was so rich, and you can one hundred percent, taste the quality of the espresso. It didn't taste like drip coffee, with steamed milk like a lot of places. The quality was definitely present. Overal verdict: if you need a place to get some work done, you like mocha lattes and you don't care much about the extra cups, you just like the grab and go cups definitely visit here. If you want more of a 1 on 1 experience, with the nice cups and dimmer setting don't come here."

There's a good amount of seating but can fill up fast. I just got a black coffee which was strong and had a hint of fruitiness. It seems like a pretty good place to post up and work for a few hours (forgot to check for outlets tho). It has good wifi and there's a restroom.The only downside, as I mentioned, is that there were like a bunch of flies flying around!! I sat in the back and they were just like sitting on people's clothes/backpacks. Literally no one had food around me the entire time and they were still flying around. As I left, the front of the cafe looked like it might have been better. It was pretty gross."

She has espresso and I try cortado: espresso mixed with a roughly equal amount of warm milk to reduce the acidity.We have five minutes to hang out then she has to go for her hair appointment.

However, they have this guy outside almost every day for long hours at a time, loudly attempting to play the saxophone. This man has absolutely no idea what he is doing and is more often than not a nuisance to the neighborhood and customers alike. I cannot emphasize enough how bad this guy is. He is not playing songs, just random notes as loudly and as often as he can. He is a true detriment to the business and all of Graham Avenue. Hopefully they fire him or ask him to ""perform"" somewhere else so they don't continue to lose business. I could not possibly imagine going here to relax with a cup of coffee or to work while this guy is belting out the absolute worst sounds you've ever heard in your life for hours at a time directly in your face."

They do this to make more money and spend less on products they use. They will deny this but its the only real reason. Stop diluting coffee variety. I thought I was paying for coffee.

Now that my recent favorite has closed (the owner retired), I'm happy I've given Bagels & Co. another try. The quality is once again really good. The bagels are soft on the inside and harder on the outside, with only moderate chewiness. The one spread I tried was full of the olives it promised. The premises were clean, and although the line went out the door at 11 am on a Sunday, the staff was efficient, friendly, and there were enough of them to make the wait under 10 minutes. There is plentiful outdoor seating in addition to a large dining room and seats opposite the counter where the line is waiting. In addition, the other baked goods and Jewish delicacies seemed really well prepared, although I haven't had a chance to try them yet. Added bonus: 30 minutes after I left the store, the extra bagels I'd bought to have at home were still warm. It seems the bagels are $1.25 each and the bagel with olive spread was $3.80, all very fair prices for today."

I'd likely argue that one bagel here equates to two Costco bagels Some of my favorite flavors include French toast bagel and blueberry bagel. This is one of the stores that brings me New York bagel pride and I would recommend to my out of state friends and family any time. At the store I did see two customers that were on their way leaving the store and were maskless. While the staff tried to get them to put their masks on, the customers said they were leaving any basically ignored the staff request. While it wasn't something the staff could control, I thought it was a bit disappointing."

I hate walking into a place of business where the employees look at me like they want to chop me up into a million pieces at 9 o clock in the morning. The employees here seem miserable and give off the worst energy. I absolutely hate it and to think that these are the people handling my food. The only good thing about this place is the everything bagel, that's all. It's almost one of the best everything bagels I think I've ever had but I hate the service so I don't even bother going anymore. Once in a while my boyfriend would stop by and pick me up one but he's starting to get annoyed with the service as well. Firstly, the vegetable cream cheese and the strawberry cream cheese both need work. The vegetable cream cheese has like specks of vegetables and it's just not working for me. The strawberry cream cheese is mousse consistency and I'm not sure why but the taste is okay. I had it on a cinnamon raisin bagel that was hard as a rock and there definitely wasn't enough strawberry cream cheese to combat my bagel. This place is located on a very business corner and they have a good amount of seating inside. There is also street parking available."
1136,ENTEjE5ENDqrVncjoYstyA,9/9/2016,1 star rating,"How this place has four-stars on Yelp is beyond me. It's an awful excuse for a good bagel. First of all, the only reason why I came here was because my go-to place was out of tofu cream cheese, and this was just around the corner. I called in advance to make sure they had it in stock and the woman on the phone was incredibly rude.Anyway, my normal order is a bagel with tofu cream cheese, and I usually get a half-pound of tofu to take home. This...at my usual spot...costs $5.70. When I was paying at Bagels & Co, it was almost $12!!! ABSURD. It's not like I even had any lox! I looked at the cashier and was like WTF HOW, and she pulled out the price list and showed me how a HALF POUND of tofu costs $6.50! WHO CHARGES THAT MUCH?! You could go to a local supermarket and get an entire container of Tofutti for half the price. Mind you, a half-pound here is MORE EXPENSIVE than my ENTIRE ORDER at my normal bagel shop.The bagel itself...I got a multigrain one...it may as well have been a rock. Disgusting."

What I won't do is spend my money in an establishment that treats me like I'm an inconvenience or like they doing me a favor by taking my money ( I gave this place MULTIPLE chances cause we all have had a bad day or two). This place use to be so welcoming and I loved coming in ( back when there was a woman running the front end, they should have kept her)! Now EVERY TIME I go in it's always a grumpy old man that gives me attitude for wanting to spend my money here. They don't have ANYTHING up showing pricing and don't ask questions cause lord you gone piss him off! I asked if they had jerk chicken wings....NO ( ummm ok as I look around wondering how I'm suppose to know what you got if it's not posted). Well do you guys have a menu... this old man looked me up and down like I was annoying him. WTF!!! I have worked in customer service for 20 years ( part of that was in food service), and currently as a business owner.  I can tell this business has no training in customer service.

I know what you're thinking, steak at restaurants tend to be rubbery, but I PROMISE you, Buddy's finesses their steak - with their tender and oh so well seasoned steak, you'll get the works- this includes guacamole, tomatoes, and onions. For a lil kick, grab their house made picked peppers, you will not regret it. I'd recommend eating there, but if you're planning on eating it later in the day, I low heat pan fry my burrito - eating it while warm is way better imo. Also, their popsicles. omg. There's a mangonada flavor and cucumber lime which is TOO DIE FOR in the summer. Literally will help you beat the heat! Overall, I'd recommend taking it to go or eating outside because the inside of the restaurant is on the dim side. The service workers there are very friendly. I haven't tried the other burritos but i don't think I need to, because the gourmet burrito just hits the spot! If you don't eat too much, This meal can be eaten in two seatings so you'll get your moneys worth"
1158,0Y8dv9UHGquFkWlVK7PdjA,1/19/2023,4 star rating,Started ordering lunch from here and have been impressed with the quality of the food and decent prices. I have had both a traditional burrito and a burrito bowl so I believe I have run the burrito spectrum.    The standard Burrito I had was the Fajita Burrito which was grilled chicken with the fajita veggies with the usual burrito filling rice and bean. It was filled to the brim and quite sizable and very tasty. I got the selection of homemade sauces/salsas which were all good and ranged in heat index.     The Burrito bowl was also chock full of goodness only in bowl form. Just as good but less carbs!    The Churros are also very good and not as greasy as they can be in some places plus they came with both a  chocolate  dipping sauce as well as a frosting that tasted like Biscoff.       Very solid overall.

I learned the hard way that it is best to order ahead. This place seems pretty popular and had a fair amount of people in line. They have an open kitchen concept and you can see the food being prepared.  I ordered the fish tacos, which took some time. Again I would advise you call ahead. The fish tacos were okay. The fish was nothing spectacular but the other fixings were fresh and flavorful."

It is all about the burritos, and they have one that is not to be missed.Quality: Buddy's Burritos & Taco Bar deserves a lot more attention for their ridiculously good burritos. Everything I tried was good, but the El Grande Burrito With Steak was perfection. We started with Guacamole And Chips, which was solid. The Guac is all avocado, so expect a lot of freshness. The Quesadilla With Beef is good, but if you order it, it needs to be the first thing you eat. Time is not good to the dish. Honestly though, you should not mess around and just dig into the Burrito. I selected the El Grande Burrito With Steak and ordered it with no beans. They have two smaller options one with rice and beans, and the other wetter with salsa, guacamole, and cheese. The El Grande merges them with all the extras, and because it is so hefty it needs a second wrap. The ingredients are fresh, the flavor is good, and each bite is heavenly.Quantity: Everything comes in big portions, and the El Grande Burrito is no joke.Value: $5 for Guacamole And Chips. $8 for the Quesadilla With Beef $9.50 for the El Grande Burrito With Steak.Ambiance: Buddy's Burrito & Taco Bar is located along Court Street in the Cobble Hill area of Brooklyn. Walking by it does not look like much, a simple counter inside and a sign outside showing its age. They have a few table out front, and a few additional inside. The inside area is dim and really dominated by the kitchen. However, the staff is friendly and chatty, bringing some life into an otherwise run-down shop. Crowd: A pretty constant flow during lunch hours. Most people grabbing food to-go.Service: Great staff, who helped us move from outside to inside when it started to rain. They take a little time with the food, but only to make sure it is done right.Parking: Some street parking along Court Street"

When I was paying, I noticed they rounded up my order.  It was over $43 and they charged me $45 which isn't a big deal. I would've tipped them anyways."

The onion rings were hard as a rock and cold as well.  The double cheese burgers were cold and had hard crusty edges as  if they had been sitting for a long period of time.  The bag that they put my items in was previously used,  you could tell because the bag was wrinkled and had grease stains on it.  I made the mistake of not inspecting my order before I left the drive through.

We started our meal with some excellent but expensive red wine from their large wine list; a salad which was good but not quite outstanding. As a main course I had the halibut which was fresh, delicious, and presented on a bed of assorted colored legumes. On the negative side, the entree was of very modest size and really needed some rice or potatoes to fill a lonely looking plate. My companions did enjoy their meat and chicken entrees. The chicken while minimally adequate in size was served with some delicious mashed potatoes . We asked several times for more bread to serve our table of four after quickly finishing a small half loaf of four slices but it never arrived. On a prior visit I had the mussels and fries which were quite good. On this visit we skipped dessert there since we planned to have said later in the evening. For this dining experience I would rate it pleasurable but quite honestly I don't like leaving a restaurant still feeling hungry; especially a pricey one at that, and for that reason alone reluctantly deduct a star from food that is of very good quality."

Frisee salad was all the roots, yesterdays bacon and a tiny egg. Very sad. Kinda hilarious. The place is cute. The staff definitely could care less if you are there. 5 dollars for ice tea!

We shared all between the two of us, every single thing was great:- Caesar Salad: the dressing is superb, glad I didn't order it on the side as I usually do.- French Onion Soup: a classic, kind of my barometer for a French resto lol- Curry Mussels Frites: omg, I almost lick the last drop of coconut milk curry broth there! It was great! Next time I want to try their other mussels too (there are 3 types).- Halibut with truffle oil over sautéed zucchini, tomatoes and onions: it was perfection, a thick piece of halibut with the right amount of truffle flavor, drizzled w balsamic reduction and tasty veggies.- Tarte Tatin: amazing, very tasty apple tart with vanilla ice cream.As Jimmy told us, many items have been on their menu for many years, so they are all perfect and you know what you are getting if you come again.The place has been open for 36 years, quite a huge achievement for any NYC restaurant! It has a very neighborhoody cozy vibe, many customers knew each other, and many people are regulars too. We just moved nearby, definitely coming back, and hope to be one of those regulars too :)I was surprised to see the 3 stars here, but I know many places on Yelp get destroyed bc tourists come and think everything is expensive (Like this guy comparing the price of the tartare to one in Spain? Yes, I had $8 stakes in Argentina that were waaay better than many $50 stakes in NYC, but it's not fair to compare. Seriously?) In any case, dinner for two with a bottle of wine and a drink came up to $250 pre tip here. It is on the expensive side, but you get what you pay, everything was deliciously, thoughtfully prepared and top notch quality (not a single mussel tasted ""weird""). And in this zip code you are not going to find much better deals either. Location is great too. You get a glimpse of CP and into the corner with Madison (which is lovely too).5 stars in my book."

This store is actually two separate buildings: the main grocery store south of 79th Street and the gluten free store at the northwest corner of 79th & 1st. Someone once told me that the main store was the most expensive grocery store in NYC, and I blame them entirely for how long it took me to go in this place; it's entirely untrue! Yes, their produce is more expensive than nearby supermarket chains, but it's nowhere near the pricing of Butterfield, Eli's, or other high end stores nearby. And regardless, that's not why you come here. You come here for the cheese selection that always comes through for my wine & cheese nights, and you come for their amazing selection of pastas (including fresh, made in store!) and baked goods. Across the street, the gluten free store has more gluten free pasta brands straight from Italy than I've ever seen in my life, and their premade gluten free counter selections are so so good. Their gluten free cheesecake and tiramisu are my go-to pick-me-ups when I'm craving something sweet. I've also had the pleasure of meeting the owner, and it's clear how much he cares about his store and his customers. Agata & Valentina is one of my favorite things about the Upper East Side, and I will continue coming here again and again for the gluten free foods, cheese, and more."

When I entered a section that appeared to be a nice cafe, I was pleasantly greeted by the nice young lady. She saw me taking photos and smiled at my excitement when I told her how nice the space was. She said she was glad I liked it. Naturally I gravitated to the coffee and pastries. There's so many selections I haven't seen elsewhere. They have fresh sandwiches prepared too. I thought I would check out the grocery section and then return for something to eat. I was still taking photos when I entered the produce department. All of a sudden the produce employee decided to tell me I wasn't allowed to take photos in there. He said you need to go ask the store manager. I left and walked around the corner where I spotted the cheese section. I went on a little further and noticed there were no customers in the store. I can understand why. I didn't feel welcome at all. It was obvious the customers that did shop there were doing what I did. They got coffee and pastries from the nice friendly employee section and then went outside to sit. I doubt I will return. I have other places close by that welcome me and my business."

Love the stuffed peppers with prosciutto and provolone here that I can't find anywhere else in the groceries store close to me so I come often to buy them. Oh, and never leave without buying a gorgeous semolina baguette. Awesome array of prepared foods, super fresh produce and herbs. 10/10!"

They were delicious, obviously freshly made for lunch. The crust was not a thin style, but it was light & toasty. Not greasy at all. There is plenty of seating, booths and counters with stools. The staff was friendly and patient as we tried to decide from the many options.We definitely would come back again on our way to Coney Island."

I get down to lobby had to wait for elevator I'm on 9th floor. Delivery guy gives my order to some guy in the lobby. I had to chase down this guy for my food. Delivery guy does not apologize and gives me an attitude. Food is good but I will not be disrespected and given an attitude over your multiple mess ups.

The tomato sauce and cheese was too much, everything was starting to fall apart. Even La Bella Express' Margherita pizza was better. The garlic bread was way better than the pizza but I suggest that they cut it into smaller pieces like L&B does. Otherwise, it's just a clump of garlic in the middle of the bread."

I love their pizza. I was on grub hub and when they popped up I decided to check out the menu. I was surprised, lol, I always thought it was just pizza, rolls, rice balls etc. so I ordered lasagna and a regular mixed salad. Hubs got the pasta with meat sauce, prosciutto and mushrooms. The lasagna was full of meat, I actually saw ricotta and plenty of mozzarella, sauce was good too. Salad was just a regular mixed salad, iceberg, red onions, cucumbers and tomato. Everything was fresh, it looked fresh besides tasting that way. The lasagna noodles were perfectly cooked! Not mushy at all. Next time we'll try something different. I've passed their other store on Ave U and it's always crowded with people sitting and eating more then just pizza. Well good to know we really enjoyed our dinner tonight  Sorry no photos I just didn't think of it."

1220,BnxCmiyVd3mlUhv4nXBs2g,1/3/2021,2 star rating,Very....okay. Not at all a typical NY style pizza. The crust is too thick and the cheese and sauce is too slight. Probably won't order again. IMMTU
1221,BnxCmiyVd3mlUhv4nXBs2g,7/22/2017,5 star rating,"At first I wasn't sure how the pizza would taste by just looking at it, but once it was heated up, I couldn't wait to taste how delicious it would be. I really wish that I bought TWO!!! The pizza tastes so good... I really might have to stop and get another one! They have a deal where you can get two pizzas and a drink for about $5 which is a great deal because the slices are big enough. Definitely check this place out if you're in the area and if you are looking for an affordable place to eat. Parking is a little difficult, it's New York so if you have a friend, one of you hop out of the car and get the pizza while the other makes sure the car doesn't get a ticket."
1222,BnxCmiyVd3mlUhv4nXBs2g,2/4/2021,5 star rating,I love this place! If you get a slice ($2 per slice) make sure you ask for it to be hot always better when it's hot. I strongly recommend the lasagna pizza. Everything on their menu is amazing and best part they are not racist like this other Italian pizza spot in Jamaica( if you live in the area you know which one). They won't treat you differently if you have to much melon in your skin and that's another reason why I love coming here. They are some how able to give great taste for low cost.

The servers were great and very attentive, and the waiter knew the menu inside and out. The restaurant itself is beautiful too, with a large welcoming bar. The food was really good (whatever that veal special was... incredible!), but the portions were a little smaller than what I was expecting. Also the menu itself is somewhat limited, but we sampled a few different items and every single one of them was delicious. As one of the lesser-known Italian restaurants in the Times Square area, it's worth a visit for sure."

I was quickly greeted and the hostess asked someone who I think was the owner to store my luggage, which was nice and very helpful. I hate rolling my luggage into a restaurant, but sometimes, that's just how it is. I ordered the tortellini bolognese after having some of their nice house bread. The bolognese came out much faster than expected, which was great because I was on a time crunch. It was pretty flavorful, and I paired it with two glasses of Chianti.From an ambience perspective, I appreciated that all the staff were dressed nicely in suits and professional attire. The restaurant was reasonably large but felt like it had a sort of family-owned vibe.I'd come back to Arno!"

Great for a full dinner experience or just to enjoy drinks.  The fried branzino fillet was amazing. Very light and fresh. The linguini with clam sauce was also very good.

In fact, being led here felt like a fever dream because I'd walked around the neighborhood so many times and never once noticed Arno. When the door opened it was like you were going into a different vibe completely. The interior is quiet and nice. We had reservations so we were led right to our seats, in the center of the dining area. Although we were in the middle of the restaurant, the experience was very intimate and we all felt comfortableOur server was extremely kind, easy to talk to, and answered all questions we had with ease. He was knowledgeable about the food and was able to anticipate our needs. The food was delish, especially the freshly made pasta. The mushroom pasta was the best by far, flavorful and had great texture. The gnocchi was a bit mushy but you could tell that it was all fresh The desserts were just alright The veggie pasta was great too, super fresh!"
1237,NhBUzlITbu3rdjm9UEfWsw,1/14/2023,5 star rating,Have been ordering here since the height of the pandemic. Id just have to say their portioning and overall taste and flavor was extremely plentiful!  Make sure if you order the biriyani or butter chicken/ that you ask for dark meat!Do NOT pass up on the chicken samosas. They are extremely bigger than what i am used to and definitely are flavorful. Soak up that butter chicken sauce with their garlic naan!
1238,NhBUzlITbu3rdjm9UEfWsw,1/14/2023,3 star rating,"Came to Raj's after a recommendation from a friend to try their seekh kebab and although the food was solid, I was definitely disappointed by how long it took me to get my food. After ordering in person for take out, me and my friend waited almost 30 minutes in store before getting our rather small order (2 chicken kebab, 1 lamb kebab, with garlic naan) People who ordered after us and sat down to eat in the store got their food before we did  -- regardless I'm going to stick with ordering via delivery if I do come back ! I thought the naan and chicken kebab were sure hits -- the garlic naan bread was fluffy, had just the right amount of flavor, and complemented the chicken when eating them together . I thought the chicken was cooked perfectly, very juicy and tender. The lamb on the other hand, seemed pretty dry which its saving grace was the terrific green sauce that was provided with the kebabs."
1239,NhBUzlITbu3rdjm9UEfWsw,11/30/2022,2 star rating,"I wanted to like this place but ordered delivery, got chicken vindaloo and a vegetarian samosa and both seemed very bland. The samosa was not very flavorful and the vindaloo was not spicy enough! For a dish where you can order the spice level, the samosa was NOT spicy at all. I couldn't believe how bland it was!Very disappointed because of the good reviews here. Also I tried going there once to sit down and eat and the restaurant seemed like a mess. There was no one in the front to sit us and the place didn't look finished."
1240,NhBUzlITbu3rdjm9UEfWsw,4/2/2023,4 star rating,"The food is really good for a very good price and the portion is very large. The butter chicken is to die for. We ordered vegetable samosa, onion bhajiyas, butter chicken, lamb biryani, mali kofta curry, garlic naan, and mango lassi Everything was so good, but in my opinion, the butter chicken and lamb biryani were a smash hit. The mango lassi was standard and always a good choice of beverage. The onion bhajiyas were so crunchy as well. I usually order this to go, and it's so good as a leftover. There is very limited seating, and there isn't as much staff for dining in, so it is slower. Definitely would order out again instead of dining in. I will say the staff and owner are SO KIND and a great man."

It's mostly take-out and delivery, but there are a few tables to dine in. Lunch combos are two small portions of veg/meat plus a pile of rice and a naan. The veg lunch special is $8.50 plus tax; with a tip it's $10 even. Not healthy but easily enough for two carb-heavy lunches!"
1243,NhBUzlITbu3rdjm9UEfWsw,10/2/2022,4 star rating,"My favorite Indian food spot to order from in the neighborhood! The main reason I love Raj's is because while I like flavorful food with tons of spices, I do not like when the food has a lot of heat and sometimes when I ask for mild it seems like they also forget to flavor the food.  Raj's does a great job on delivering flavorful mild versions of their dishes.  They have plenty of vegetarian options but my go-tos are the paneer mahkni and the mutter paneer.  They are both quite similar so usually decide based on whether I am in the mood for peas or not.  Both sauces are very creamy and tomatoey, although less tomatoey than a Tikka masala.  Delivery is very quick but they are also within a block for me so I have gone in person as well and they are very nice and attentive to in-person patrons despite having to field so many online delivery orders.  If you do decide to go in person, make sure you ring the bell because they are really working hard back there to fulfill those online orders and might not notice you have arrived for pickup or dining in otherwise."

Here were the stand outs:+ Butter chicken: the sauce was so velvety and paired perfectly with rice. + Lamb biriyani: there were HUGE chunks of lamb in this dish. Very well spiced, very flavorful. It also came with yogurt sauce, which was creamy and balanced the spice of this dish perfectly. Be prepared for this dish to be on the spicier side.+ Garlic Naan: Soft. Essential."

If you're a craft beer fan, you might not find a better spot in Manhattan, both in terms of the variety (plenty of every style, I never had the same beer twice) and price, with some cans as low as $3. They have about 10 drafts, and then multiple fridges filled with cans that you can drink on premises, or buy 2go. I love that design for a bar, and wish more places would do it. It's small, so not a whole lot of seating inside, basically just the bar, but they have outdoor seating set up. Bartenders were all super nice and cool to talk to. It's kind of un assuming, and you might miss it just walking down the street, but I highly recommend checking it out. It's worth making the trip here, and if I ever find myself back in NYC I'm definitely making a point to come back."

Beer Run isn't excluded from the group. I've just found myself continuously somewhat disappointed with them. It's a small area to sit inside but in warmer times they have an outdoor seating as well. Or you can purchase stuff to go. All of the above which I have done. They also have a range of stuff on tap. Anyway, the last time I went in I saw a beer can I had never tried before from Evil Twin. It was marked at around $5 so I was game for buying it and taking it home. He rings it up and it's closer to $10 or $11. Another annoying thing I don't think they take cash because they always just push the credit card machine towards me. But I digress. I asked and said it was labeled in the fridge as a different price and he just looks blankly at me and says it's a high proof beer, sorry. I paid for it because I felt like I was stuck in a conundrum but it makes me question now over whether everything is marked accurately."

Not just that, Beer Run's bartenders have great taste in beer and are totally willing to share their knowledge and their current favorite brews. Their bartenders are so good that I even encourage you to put your trust in their hands, give them your current taste profile, and let them choose a beer or a can to go or multiple cans for you!"

Been fortunate enough to converse and get to know a few of the staff members and exchange some knowledge about craft beer. A small yet one of the better bottle shows that the city has to offer. Expect to get the usual local breweries along with some out of state beers that may be harder to come by. I've yet been able to experience some indoor drinking here but was able to enjoy some outdoor drinking and fun. With a good selection of craft beer ( sours, ipas, stouts and more ) and an enjoyable atmosphere, I highly recommend all craft beer lovers to give this spot a try."

Maybe there were 3 or 4 wines to choose from. We had two small glasses of wine for $10 each and a warm pretzel for $5. A tad pricey for the wine given the scenario outside in a shack by the curb. If it was a fair price for beer I wouldn't mind. $10 for a small glass of vino? , meh. Service was good given we were the only souls there. I would come again during covid if I wanted a beer."

On top of the that, there is a 15% off happy hour special on draft items. While settling on a few IPAs, there is also complimentary peanuts to munch on (always a plus). Bartender here is talkative and friendly, as well as some solid music in the background. Not much a food list, but they do allow outside stuff if you see fit."

The staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating.We started with the kinoko, gyoza and shrimp tempura appetizers. The mushroom-soy appetizer was the standout of the group. Very tasty and left me wanting more. The gyoza was similar to others I've tried. The shrimp tempura was perfectly made with a nice light batter.But in the end we were here for the sushi omakase. This came in 4 rounds with 3 pieces the first 3 rounds and and a hand roll to finish it off. The wasabi in the yellow fin tuna roll was a bit strong for me but the other pieces were delicate and tasted great. My standout favorites were the yellowtail, fatty tuna, trout and mackerel. I was very surprised by the Spanish mackerel since I normally find mackerel too fishy but this was really good as well. My least favorite was the uni but this was the first time I had it and it's just not my thing. The fatty tuna roll at the end was a great way to finish the meal.The sushi presentation was impressive and the freshness of the fish was notable. For a first-time omakase experience, this place comes highly recommended."

We got the omakase but nothing really stood out to me. I felt very rushed by the waiter who I felt was watching me the whole time waiting for me to finish so he could take our plates away. They also gave very rushed and unclear descriptions of each fish. The fish did taste fresh but really was nothing outstanding. I have had much better omakase elsewhere.

There are so many sushi spots in this part of Brooklyn.So, so many to choose from, we landed on this one after reading some recent reviews. During the pandemic, it seems like nobody is getting authentic in front of the sushi chef omakase experiences. Nevertheless, we had a wait after our reservation time slot and were seated shortly after in the back of the restaurant and there were so many dividers. The servers (we had like TWO of them for some reason), were confusing us left and right because they were both taking our orders and clearly English was not their primary language so there was an awkward moment here and there when they were taking our orders. The omakase here was memorable - not TOO memorable because of the environment we were in, felt a little weird. Perhaps it's the PS area that's rampant with high prices but we did not feel like we ate our money's worth. The food here was good regardless, wouldn't come back however."

I was in the area and had reason to celebrate so I treated myself to the $55 sushi omakase.It was four rounds - the first three were 9 pieces of sushi, and the final was a hand roll.I'm not going to remember everything I had - but the highlights were the bluefin tuna, uni, Spanish mackarel, and red snapper. All very fresh, carefully crafted, and beautifully presented.They've got both sidewalk seating, and also an atrium-ish section. Definitely lives up to the hype!"

They seated us at a regular table so we didn't get the ""full"" experience as I heard that being able to watch the chefs make your sushi is really cool. We got the Sashimi & Sushi Omakase and it came with quite a good amount. I felt perfectly satisfies at the end - not hungry, but not overstuffed. My friend and I also shared the Tori KaraAge for the appetizer which was good but could've used a little more flavor or sauce. Overall, the omakase was great!"

That is the only way to go if you want to have a great experience. The chef will communicate with you, explain what it is. Watch you so they know if you are wanting to go fast or slow, full or still hungry!"

1264,B-lJd1eBLcLk1StNbgAe9w,6/14/2022,4 star rating,"Had dinner at Sushi Katsuei on Thursday evening. A more formal sushi experience at a slightly lower price point, but without any true stand-out items.Quality: I was happy with the meal we had at Sushi Katsuei. It is not in quite the same class as NYC's best, but it was not bad for the cost. While I wish it was done at the bar, table service was still pretty nice. I think the Sashimi And Sushi Omakase gives a good glimpse of the quality, which was solid. They are definitely more creative with the sashimi and typical with the sushi.Quantity: The Omakase options clearly delineate the portions to expect.Value: $8.50 for the Shumai. $5 for the Edamame. $77 for the Sashimi And Sushi Omakase.Ambiance: Sushi Katsuei is located in Park Slope. They have a few outdoor tables, but most of the seating is inside. It appears like they previously had bar seating, but now it is only tables. Most tables had barriers built between them, implemented during COVID. It is a casual environment, despite the higher-end experience.Crowd: Reservations are recommended as it gets crowded quickly.Service: Fast, yet elegant service. Parking: Some limited street parking."

This was my first omakase experience (got the kosher option) with 12 pieces of sashimi. Each piece of fish, especially the ootoro, melted - quicker than butter - almost like a creme brûlée. The chef uses real wasabi, paired with the best toppings and sauces for each fish.The oysters were smooth, sweet, and lightly salty. The experience of eating them was almost like slurping soft udon noodles.Overall this place was so great, I went twice. Definitely a good price ~ 90-130/person for omakase."

There are bars that have lots of pinball machines in Brooklyn.There are bars that provide board games in Brooklyn.But as far as I know, there are no other bars in Brooklyn that have all of the above, giant metal scissors above the pinball machines because the place was almost a barbershop, dice for Cee-lo, and FILTERED WATER TAPS AT EVERY TABLE.Those that know me best know that water is my favorite beverage, and I absolutely love that Seaborne has water available to all, right at your fingertips. Pinball tip: If you want to feel like you're good at pinball, play the Metallica game. If you want to feel like you're a worthless human being, be as bad at pinball as I am and play the Wizard of Oz. The owner also lives upstairs part time, and he's the man. That doesn't really matter much, but it's a fun fact for you."

Especially with all the tragedy surrounding it, and the delayed opening.But I guess I should've showed up back when it opened, because come April, it was a pretty crappy experience.First of all, it was completely empty on a Saturday night, which isn't a good sign (maybe two tables had people). There was just one guy working, and he didn't seem to care about manning the bar or being friendly (he washed dishes and didn't look up whenever people walked in, but just yelled at them to tell them they could sit anywhere). Also, there actually isn't a bar. What I mean is that there's a counter, but no stools, so you can't actually sit *at* the bar and watch the drinks get made, which is half the fun of cocktail bars.Anyway, the drink menu itself was pretty underwhelming. Not sure if they dialed back the list since they opened, but most of the choices were really simple (3-4 ingredients) and were very boring sounding. No seasonal ingredients. Nothing to make them stand out. Even their ""Modern"" cocktails list was pretty lame. My friend and I had the Redhook and the Fitzroy, and both were okay, but nothing special at all.Also, the place is cash only, and there's no onsite ATM. $12 cocktails adds up quickly when they don't take credit, so plan accordingly. But if you're like us, it'll be one and done. We thought it would be a destination spot and even took an Uber out here, but that was a mistake."

I haven't been there in a while, but there was a stretch of Friday's when I would go on a pilgrimage for the African Flower, my absolute favorite cocktail. (Bourbon, crime de cacao, amaro and an orange twist) When you walk through the doors, you are transported to a different time - the late 40s style furniture and decor, some BeBop playing over the sound system, and real care from the bartender. Each cocktail is specially made, and absolutely delicious. The management was kind enough to open the place just for my birthday gathering one evening. It's a speakeasy without it being one, and I love it for that."

As I'm eating better and doing long extended walks; I decided after my walk to Flatbush, I would finally visit. I arrived a little after 12PM. I was standing around for about five minutes or so, I didn't see anyone; finally a woman comes out, but she doesn't even acknowledge me and goes back in. A few minutes later, a postal worker came, she shouted out mail and the woman returns, only then does she finally ask me what I want. (-1)I step outside to wait for the food to be made, I see the same lady back out laughing with another customer. I have my headphones on outside, so I hear some very loud yelling (unbeknownst to me, she was trying to let me know my food was ready)--I just didn't find the service to be up to par, as a whole, but now onto the food.I order Salmon (order comes with two sides--I went with Broccoli and Macaroni and cheese). The salmon was excellent, it was very well seasoned too. Macaroni was great too, the broccoli could have been a little softer. However, I'd rate the food 9 out of 10.If you want great food with a side of attitude/being a bit, this is definitely your place. I'd probably return and hope that the service was a little better and that would surely make me a repeat customer!"

I got the grilled salmon meal that comes with 2 sides. You get a large piece of salmon on top of the two sides you order. I got the mixed vegetables and okra. They were delicious. The mixed vegetables consisted of broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, a small piece of corn on the Cobb and some carrots. The okra was perfectly cooked as well and the salmon was excellently seasoned. I order this for delivery. The meal also comes with a side of house made hot sauce that was delicious, and a white sauce the looked like ranch. Definitely give this place a try if you're looking for quality fish or just a healthy, well prepared meal."

So my Dad actually put me on to the spot and I Have ordered from them about 4 times already!! I even got my significant other to order from there as well.  Disclaimer: KING FISH SELLS OUT THE QUICKEST. OKAY, so it's pretty small inside but they do have seating and a TV so your not just aimlessly waiting. The customer  service is exceptional and the food is GREAT. Very flavorful and tasty to the mouth and body. I have wanted to try there grilled king fish but as I mentioned it sells out fast. I have yet to try it. Which is a bit dissapointing. BUTTT JUST FISHY IS BECOMING A STAPLE FOOD SPOT TO ORDER FROM. I order the grilled salmon w/ lo mein and sweet plantains. Pro's: flavorful salmon and lo' mein is jusr so bomb little spice fresh and taste so rich. (In my opinion )Con's : sweet plantains aren't always as sweet as anticipated which I hope they get better with. They still tatse ok but it takes away from the food and being that you order sweet plantains and you get ones that are semi ripe or not ripe at all diminishes the experience and make you not want it anymore. Plating is very neat and portions are well worth the mount paid. Besides the one con just fishy is a go too. GO CHECK OUT GREAT CARRIBEAN FOOD. TELL THEM TOSH SEN"

Also got to jam out to a little She's Like the Wind (RIP Patrick Swayze) while waiting for my food.I always get a fried chicken sandwich here. There are tons of toppings to choose from, I usually get mine with cheddar, lettuce, tomato, regular onion or grilled onions, sometimes even onion rings on top. Lunch special is a burger (or chicken sandwich), a side of fries or onion rings, and a drink for $14.99.I prefer their chicken sandwich to Shake Shack (sometimes you get a gristley piece), McDonald's (makes me feel queasy after eating it), Wendy's (just no). Def a great spot to grab a burger and fries, casual, relaxed vibe, tasty food. No complaints here!"

This way way before shake shack and bare burger on Austin. The business at cheeburger was busy every time we went back in the day. Today is different story, it's lifeless and depressing to see whenever we drive or walk by their storefront. Last Friday, after my son's piano lesson we decided to give it try since my son never tried it.Off the bat, my son seemed to really like the old 50's style decor and ambiance. He never seen anything like this in person other than watching it in movies. We ordered the couple's special. It comes with two serious burgers, best of both (fries and onion rings), 2 sodas w/ free refills, and a banana split for $34. We ordered my son their junior burger, included fries and a drink for $6-7. The burger was very juicy on a tasty brioche bun. The fries and onion rings were nice and crispy, and the Oreo banana split was great! When it came to the food and service, I have nothing to complain about during this visit.Verdict - Skip the pounder, the couple's special is a great deal. Service was great. The only complaint I have would be their restroom. It's quite filthy and in need of a renovation."
1290,MCoFw4vFk6kCSdYfyau6DQ,1/5/2022,4 star rating,"I was craving a burger and some fast food so we went last week before our movie. Very quiet night (Tuesday). But the staff were welcoming and very sweet. Our server was super helpful. She was honest with us about food items (such as warning us that the sriracha wing sauce was very spicy) which I appreciate. We got a bunch of food. 2 burgers, fried pickles, nachos and wings plus 2 chocolate milkshakes with oreos. The milkshakes were delicious - I don't think mine lasted more than 2 minutes I drank it so fast. The fried pickles are probably the best I've ever had anywhere....so perfectly crisp, nicely salted, just YUM. I crave those pickles. The wings were good, albeit a little on the fatty side (I'd ask for them well done if you like a crisp wing). We got the sauces on the side. The teriyaki was eh, just ok. Buffalo was standard and I liked it. The sriracha was insanely hot (and I like spice). The nachos were great. I'm not usually a nacho fan, but they use the creamy queso kind of cheese that you find at places like 7-11 and I just really liked that. The only reason I take a star is because for a burger joint, the burgers weren't really anything special. The patty itself didn't have any real flavor, even with the toppings I put on it. I've had some really amazing burgers, even at places similar to this, so I just expect a little more from a burger place. Either way we left completely stuffed and happy. I would definitely return the next time I've got a craving for some greasy fried fast(ish) food."

Fried pickles are good just know they are salty so add for ranch to dip them in. The burgers are juicy and the Mac and cheese bites are nicely made. They hold specials on certain days and even have a dinner and movie option to get a free movie ticket with your purchase. Many years ago they had this challenge for eating a huge burger in a certain amount of time! My ex completed it and took a picture with their plush burger (pretty big burger) and put picture on the wall. The vibe here is always relaxed.

I usually pass by for some form of iced coffee and I'm very satisfied with what I receive. They're not typically the type to load the cup with ice and then charge absurd prices for what's essentially a few sips of coffee. They also seem to be on top of their inventory; the donuts and other sweets are always fully stocked when I visit. Does that raise questions about the freshness of their goods? Possibly, but I wouldn't be the one with the answers unfortunately.Overall, I'd recommend this Dunkin' especially given its location.

I can understand being out of things once in a blue, but they are out of several things all the time consistently. A few months ago, it was not bad like this, but over the past several months it has gotten a lot worse. It really turns you off from wanting to do business with thUpdate: I spoke to the manager after that most recent incident to file a complaint about the lack of items on the menu  and constantly running out of things.

Theres about 4 or 5 tables along the wall. There's usually just two people working but they still keep up with the demand. They are also very personable because I occasionally see how they interact with the regulars. Cleanliness wise its not the worse but its okay enough to let it slide because of the limited staff. Donut wise, at least when I usually go there's not much to choose from so if you are going for a sugar fix you might not leave too happy."

1307,lhu4tB-j2UC8cjF4RNarqQ,6/1/2022,4 star rating,Love this location but have been having difficulty lately. This is a family owned business but they hired a new girl who is constantly getting my drink order wrong.  She adds oat milk to everything I order? I just want whole milk.  I don't understand the misunderstanding as I have been very clear.  This little business has been a staple for my neighborhood.  It's unfortunate that one staff member (who seems to work every day) is always messing up everyone's orders...
1308,lhu4tB-j2UC8cjF4RNarqQ,6/19/2022,1 star rating,"We ordered delivery from this Dunkin' twice, through two different delivery services.  Unfortunately, items were missing from our order in both deliveries--this was not driver error since the delivery bags that Dunkin' uses are sealed.  We cannot recommend this location."
1309,lhu4tB-j2UC8cjF4RNarqQ,8/22/2022,1 star rating,"If you have any allergies or just want food that's safe to eat. Don't come here. The girl with the Cystic acne and disgusting attitude is nasty. She doesn't wash her hands, she barely wears gloves and she mistreats the food. I ordered a croissant sandwich with no egg. The cashier who clearly hates her job takes the croissant and tosses it on the counter like a rag then she toast the croissant with egg on it, takes the egg off and puts it back in the container with the other uncooked eggs and then proceeds to make my sandwich without egg and gives it to me. When I confronted her about it she said she read the order wrong. But if you read the order wrong why did you take the egg off and put it back in the container with the rest of the un used egg? Why would you not make the sandwich over if it was a mistake? That girl is very nasty customer service wise and food wise. Afterwards she didn't even wash her hands, she went to the register and put on a new pair of gloves. I'm sure they're much worse when people are not looking. This location is the nastiest location I've ever been to. Do yourself a favor and avoid them."
1310,lhu4tB-j2UC8cjF4RNarqQ,2/4/2018,2 star rating,Place is kind of dirty and when i bit into my donut there was a hair on it.  It kinda freaked me out.The people are very nice there just need to clean up the place a little. Quick service which is a positive.

There are two young men that always work saturdays and they are AMAZING!!! They always get my order right, are fast and go above and beyond. Fire everyone but these two young men."
1312,lhu4tB-j2UC8cjF4RNarqQ,9/19/2020,1 star rating,"This place is ran by idiots. Don't even bother doing a mobile order because they don't start working on it until you tell them to, defeating the entire purpose. And that's even if they give you the correct OR complete order. I can't tell you how many times I've ordered a hot drink only to have it come out as iced. Complete waste of time and only adds more to morning frustration instead of relieve it."

The man (Darkskin older man, very short) Is so nice! I like my drinks made In a specific way and he knows just how to make it. The only thing that l dislike about this Dunkin' Donuts is that they allow outsiders to sit in there for how ever long they please and l don't think that is fair to the customers. Sometimes it is hard to get a seat here because they're all filled with outsiders. I hope they put a stop to that soon."
1315,lhu4tB-j2UC8cjF4RNarqQ,1/28/2018,3 star rating,The service is fine but they're grossly overpriced compared to the Dunkin' Donuts a few blocks over on Church and Flatbush. Like a $1+ for the same coffee or sandwich that you can get 5 blocks over.
1316,lhu4tB-j2UC8cjF4RNarqQ,8/12/2015,3 star rating,"The location is convenient for me so I go here when I'm craving a sweet or iced coffee. The staff behind the counter takes your order and gives it to you without looking at you. Not sure why. They could be much friendlier especially when serving you.The actual place is ok. It's completely normal, nothing stands out. There are a few tables at the front by the window. The crowd inside depends on the the time of day, as I've seen people just sitting there to avoid the heat or because they have nothing else to do. I usually go a couple of times a month but am sure to grab and go so that if the crowd is rowdy I don't get any part of it.The neighborhood is changing so the Dunkin Donuts is getting nicer, too."

The register employee that took my order was very attentive and polite. The person that handed me my order was alright at best. But at least he processed my order really quickly. The cleanliness of the place was mehhh... Given that there were only two people and a steady stream of customers coming in, not much they can do about it. There are about 14 chairs and seven tables. So they are not required by law to have a rest room for public use. I say this because they really do not have a rest room for public use lol. There is a sign clearly saying this. Their clientele seemed a bit loud, not unlike kids and babies at your local starbucks . . . But most of them were alright and were not screaming their lungs. Would love to say something about their food, but I am sick right now and everything tastes kinda bleh.( Their wifi did not work while I was there... )"

Of all the Dunkin's this has to be the WORST. The workers don't know how to make drinks which is whatever I'll leave with it. But absolutely do not scream at customers what the f is wrong with y'all? I watched them yell at multiple customers before me, so I calmly explained the drink they made and charged me was way off. Then they yelled at me?! Do not yell at customers when you mess up. Shame on this place y'all actually the worst."

The doughnuts in the morning are sooo fresh. The afternoon staff aren't as attentive and efficient. Many standard items, such as a glazed doughnut, are either out stock or stale. Overall, your best bet is to come here during the AM."

This one time the older bengali guy who has been working there took my order and I asked to give me one more donut which he charged me for and didn't even put the second donut in and I got home to find out he only put one donut so I asked the lady the next day that the guy didn't even bother he's been messing up orders for year and the lady wasn't even reimbursing me for it now if it was starbucks they would . Another issue is they have no public restroom only WiFi and charging ports . And there are always people loitering the Dunkin' Donuts ."

I  have seen this on several occasions and wonder why this is acceptable. I will take my kids elsewhere...so unfortunate for the neighborhood and the franchise name."

1327,P9n4YVhmlmQeyeTqSGLikg,3/22/2022,5 star rating,"I've been here a number of times and I can say that the experience has been satisfactory each time.The area is spacious for what's available and there's not much of a wait between ordering and receiving goods. I usually pass by for some form of iced coffee and I'm very satisfied with what I receive. They're not typically the type to load the cup with ice and then charge absurd prices for what's essentially a few sips of coffee. They also seem to be on top of their inventory; the donuts and other sweets are always fully stocked when I visit. Does that raise questions about the freshness of their goods? Possibly, but I wouldn't be the one with the answers unfortunately.Overall, I'd recommend this Dunkin' especially given its location. It's a nice location to grab something really quick on the way to the train."

And that would be the case for this Dunkin Donuts. Numerous times there are long lines. One lady she is mean and rude. We all have to speak up due to these masks. I watched her one time be so rude to a child, where a stranger had to step in and sort of yell at her. But there is hope, it's another young lady that works here, and she is super sweet with all my encounters. She's the cashier dealing with all the customers, she makes coffee and still is so pleasant and patient. This is New York City, you have to pick what store to wait in, or walk on by. I like lattes with espresso shots. And there the only ones in this neighborhood, so here I am waiting patiently."

It is very cramped and 50% don't wear masks (patrons, not employees). I liked the baristas. The would remember my order. I brought a date here once and ordered something different than my usual disgusting, plain black dunkin's coffee and the baristas were surprised and commented that it was out of character. Slightly embarrassing explaining that I am usually joyless."

The employee kept her back to me when putting the donut on the counter and walked away. I didn't even get to finish ordering.

1331,P9n4YVhmlmQeyeTqSGLikg,10/9/2018,1 star rating,"This Dunkin' Donuts has truly become horrible. They are always out of something, which is a huge inconvenience to their customers. If they are not out of their flavored swirls, then they are out of almond milk. How can you run out of almond milk of all things when there are so many ppl in New York who cannot have regular milk due to allergies, etc.  It's really is unacceptable. I can understand being out of things once in a blue, but they are out of several things all the time consistently. A few months ago, it was not bad like this, but over the past several months it has gotten a lot worse. It really turns you off from wanting to do business with thUpdate: I spoke to the manager after that most recent incident to file a complaint about the lack of items on the menu  and constantly running out of things. Today I went to order a pumpkin spice coffee hoping maybe things improved and once again they were out of pumpkin spice flavor. This Dunkin' Donuts really is complete trash and puts in no extra effort to ensure things are restocked efficiently. It really is a shame."
1332,P9n4YVhmlmQeyeTqSGLikg,12/30/2016,3 star rating,"I've visited this location a few times. It gets off and on busy in waves since its right there on Nostrand and church. Either way the service was quick and friendly. The place is long but there's not too much seating so it's not much of a hangout spot if you have a big group. Theres about 4 or 5 tables along the wall. There's usually just two people working but they still keep up with the demand. They are also very personable because I occasionally see how they interact with the regulars. Cleanliness wise its not the worse but its okay enough to let it slide because of the limited staff. Donut wise, at least when I usually go there's not much to choose from so if you are going for a sugar fix you might not leave too happy."

I was going to give one star but decided to add on another since you are able to use more than one coupon in a single purchase.

I went in to purchase a medium mocha latte but walked straight to the ice cream station in the back and while deciding on what flavor I wanted, was told by the female employee, ""If I wanted ice cream I'd have to hurry up and decide because they'd be closing in ten minutes! No pressure. Needless to say, the other two customers in there, another young lady and her daughter, looked at her like I did. Wow! Do you talk to all your customers like that? Needless to say, I was quite offended and turned right around and left! You may want to send your employees to a refresher class in customer service. Obviously, she had no clue on what good customer service is and I wasn't about to stick around to see how much worse it would  get. Left very dissatisfied. I won't be returning and it had nothing to do with the coffee. Good luck!"

But today when I got home to eat my bagel is was beyond hard- I don't know if that has to do with the bagel itself or the temperature it's being toasted. The bagels are usually hard but today it wasn't even eatable. It's bad enough I have to deal with the long lines and horrible customer service but the food and coffee should at least be good or at the very least eatable.

1343,-aievhVzik4nHkxQFXFUrg,5/3/2021,1 star rating,"Rude to customers, slow service and mediocre food. Avoid this place if you're looking to enjoy a good time. Firstly, their tables are too close to each other. I witnessed a server tell a customer she *couldn't* turn the chair around to create ample social distance between herself and me. I offered to move to an empty chair to accommodate. I'd planned to have to-go service, but since it began to rain, I figured I'd have a few bites until it was fine to leave. It was then my turn to be harassed by the server, who came over to tell me that if I ordered to go service, I wasn't *allowed* to eat at the table. I usually avoid leaving negative comments about small businesses, especially during this time, but I sorely regret choosing to support this business, and I encourage everyone else to avoid it as well until they learn to offer gracious customer service."

I placed an order via yelp/ grub hub for pickup and it was ready by the time I got there ( didn't have to wait) when I got home I tore into the bbq chicken combo and lemme tell you IT WAS GOOOD. The chicken was sweet and savory and not as sour as usual bbq sauces. Also slipped right off the bone. Although most MAC side dishes are flavorless their mac and cheese did not come to play!! Overall if you live close by you gotta check this place out. Will update as I try more menu items but the bbq chicken is a must

Always a good reason to support, right?! We didn't have any food here, we just relaxed at the bar, talked to the bar man who was Irish and enjoyed the quiet slower pace away from the outside hustle and bustle.

So we finish our dinner (totally dehydrated at this point) and are waiting for the check to arrive.  And waiting.  And waiting.  And waiting.  I finally had to walk over to the bar and ask one of the bartenders to give me the check so I can pay.   They tell me to go back to my table and they'll bring it over which they did. My friend and I actually discussed if we should even leave a tip because the service was so horrible and non-existent, but we didn't want to cause a scene, so we left a 15% tip (we usually leave 20% on average) and left.  They really didn't deserve a dime.Needless to say, we will never go back."

I would love for her to take care of me always haha - I truly am appreciative of her TLC. The food and dessert was amazing both times-  I truly enjoy my time here. Thank you Leilani!"

I was in there last night watching Monday night football and ordered the Steakhouse Mac and Cheese. The bartender brought me a bowl of greasy cheese slop. It looked like a box of Kraft. I mentioned it to the bartender (very well known) and he says he not making the food. I called to speak to the GM and he was not in, but another manager said she would look into it. I was not offered a replacement, a desert, nothing. I am very disappointed and yeah you know who I am.  The kitchen at this location is terrible. A lot of new workers and workers who obviously don't care about the work products they send out. I have had broccoli that looked like cauliflower, cold, discolored, and mushy. I am going to stop coming here now."

It's a tinnnnyy piece of vanilla cake that looks like a reindeer.We stood inside of this very crowded Starbucks while we had our coffee.There are a few tables outside, I'm not sure if they're Starbucks' property, but it's much too cold for sitting outside.I can't really recommend this location.

The Latina woman yelling the numbers was unprofessional and she had a tone whenever a customer would ask her a question.

All my son had to do is color it. It had to be ordered, I ordered two, one for my son & my niece & nephew, it was ready before the time they said to pick it up. The woman explained exactly how to color it, so....the cookies have color on it, each cookie is a different color, primary colors...it comes with two paint brushes, all you do is wet the brush put it on the cookies which have the paint on them, and color the house!!! Genius!!!! Also every thing is edible! Even the cookies with the paint on them!!! My son had so much fun coloring the house, there was zero aggravation! And I will be getting on every year! It's so worth the $30! Also....everything taste amazing!!! My son has already had two of the cookies, and the gingerbread house smells amazing!

The kids made their own pizza and each child decorated 6 cookies, they enjoyed and we did too.  Highly recommend for a kids party!"

1428,gvul1x9MMawVzStJpfGoLA,12/14/2022,2 star rating,"Decided to pick San Pietro for dinner last night as this restaurant was near the venue I had an event to go to, so we made our reservations at 5:15pm.I have a habit of always being early, so I arrived at 5pm to an empty restaurant, with the bartender/hostess person saying the kitchen doesn't open till 5:15 but we said we'd sit and relax, having a drink beforehand.We sit down, start talking, I ask her to see a menu, she wasn't really into giving us the menu, but with a little charm she did, it was weird, not sure what happened there.Anyway, in comes Manolo, a larger than life Maitre De type who reminds me of classic servers of old. A boisterous personality, booming voice, and very interesting way of handling himself.The service there is overwhelming, many people running around, suit/ties/jackets types, and imo too many cooks in the kitchen.So, bottom line, this place is ABHORRENTLY EXPENSIVE. Like these numbers, even for New York City are out of control. It's like Inflation hit this place twice as hard, and at the end of the day it wasn't worth it.We got 2 soups, 2 Aqua Panas, a beer, an old fashioned, a pasta dish and a Cesar Salad for...$188 no tip included, that's insane.The food itself was good, The beef stew was flavorful, the Stracitella was alright, The Cesar was very tasty and the Pasta was OK.This place is really for those where money is no object, and they want to just essentially throw it out like a club, insane prices again.Overall, 3 stars, won't return, remember to make sure Manolo doesn't push you around either."

Perhaps it was because we were guests of a regular customer.Service was attentive, friendly and professional. We had reservations for 8:30 on a Saturday night. The venue was half empty and quiet. Conversation was easy. The ambience comfortable, informal but elegant. I'm withholding 5 starts for two reasons. 1) The place is extremely pricey. Pastas start at 39 dollars, etc. for food which is nicely presented and fine but can be had for much less money at more humble establishments. 2) When presenting the diner with 10 plus specials to choose from they need to be written down (with prices) so that they can be examined at leisure.Nevertheless, A very pleasant evening. Perfect for a special event."

The thirst thing why we were In shock that many dish was not Italian, and not testy at least. What was really good Bronzino  fish pasta with creamy sous! If you visit this place you need to try it. The rest meal what we ordered was not tasty, specially we ordered salmon tartar and it was with truffle oil, it's terrible. When we get our check and we sow how much we need to pay, we were in shock!

The place itself is very old school, might need a revamp but I can deal with the vintage feel. I ordered champagne but was offered a drink that was called vive la fette or life of the party, the name did not match the drink. It was definitely some type of wine that got me super sleepy. It wasn't sparkling so the glass I received didn't meet my expectations. The service was good but they should make better recommendations. The colossal crab cake was ok, the tartar and other sauces made it much better, guacamole was fine, the place itself felt very commercial, too much of a franchise for my taste.My partners ordered the fish special which looked amazing. The creamed spinach was very good, right on point. I went for the filet Caesar, a nice piece of steak, stuffed with crab meat, it was incredible!! The sautéed spinach was part of the dish and it really complimented the steak. For dessert the tiramisu seemed like it was home made and tasty. The creme brûlée fell ubiquitous with the rest of the meal."

They were very hospitable at first, asking for our coats and led us to our seats etc... We ordered our food, however, the waitstaff seemed preoccupied with others who were dining at the time rather than us. Each waiter had great interactions with the people sitting around us; making conversation with who was seated at the table. However, the waitstaff was very standoffish towards my partner and I, even giving short responses that were paired with rude facial expressions. Every interaction with the waitstaff was unpleasant and had an aura of pretentiousness upon interacting with my SO and me. Additionally, the people who were dining beside us made rude and snarky comments towards myself and my partner. Again, we had never been here, so we were expecting an authentic NYC steakhouse experience, but all that we got was the NYC pretentious asshole attitude. I will say, the food was great, but the attitude does not make the experience worthwhile. If you ever choose to visit do not go here, unless if you like people who make you feel inferior."

She enjoyed herself and was very happy with the service from the waiters.  The food was excellent and tasty.  The Tiramisu was awesome and the cheesecake was delicious too. My Mom's friends and our family enjoyed the slideshow during the evening.  The salmon wad cooked to perfection. The sauteed broccoli, mushrooms and spinach was on point! The macaroni and cheese was great and so were the salads and the fried calamari. I asked my friends and family about the food and I received smiles and great feedback. Tom was excellent making sure everything was on point.  The tables were set up very nicely.  I included some decorations to make this event festive. I also loved the menus placed inside the folded napkins. My mom and her friends are still talking about the party. Thanks again to Lauren, Daniel and Tom!I forgot to mention the most important dish, the steak was very good too! Some of my guests had the filet mignon or the skirt steak. I remembered having the skirt steak in January 2020. It was a winner then and at my mom's party.Elaine C Burkes"
1443,mqJU7hNRbTrffSyj-95MXw,4/6/2019,4 star rating,"Had a business lunch reservation for a group of 14 on a Friday. We got treated to a room all just for our party! The tables were grouped together in a rectangle and we enjoyed the secluded feel thanks to the sliding doors of our room. The place has a traditional, all American, 1950's vibe. Sinatra and the such are played, creating a classy, nostalgic feel for the golden era. Relaxing atmosphere of a typical, American steakhouse--white linens, well-dressed staff, wooden furniture, warm, earthy tones and hues in décor. A perfect place for a lazy Friday lunch. Side note, at noon, this place is filled with middle aged, white suits on business lunches. Our party was the only one consisting mostly of women and people under the age of 30. We were the outliers from the general trend of the patronage demographics of this establishment.The service was impeccable. Five stars. Our waiter was nothing but a poised professional with many years of experience at its finest. Courteous, well--mannered, perfectly knowledgeable in the art of serving. Even joked with us warmly, when we didn't like our dirty martinis. He made our experience seamless and effortless. Dirty martini comes with two bleu cheese stuffed olives. Hated the martini, but olives were salty and surprisingly satisfying [I hate olives, but the cheese stuffing makes everything better]. Don't remember what was the red wine that we got. It was very aromatic and tasty. Complementary bread and butter was tasteless and bland. Tasting the bread and butter is always an interesting prelude to the dinner, so I was excited for this, which turned out disappointingly.Since we had a special group lunch/private room, we were presented with a shortened version of the menu that included limited options, so could not order everything I wanted, but still enjoyed what was made available to us. Three course menu--maybe it's also a lunch price fix menu that the restaurant offers to the rest of the customers as well. The mixed green and Caesar salads were simple and small in size. Skip; you can get better elsewhere, plus you're not here to overpay for unadorned leaves, you're here for the heavenly heavy food. I was glad I got the soup of the day instead, which was a hearty beef broth with barley, carrots, celery, and mushrooms. Very rich and satisfying for a cold, grey day. I love meat and mushrooms, so I was happy with how much beef and mushrooms were floating in my bowl. A huge portion too, and a lot of aforementioned ingredients, making this soup a perfect main dish all on its own. Now to the entrees.Classic chicken parm and linguine was huge. The amount of pasta on that plate was enough to share amongst two hungry adults. Definitely will be taking leftovers home if you order it. Seared ahi Tuna, which looked just average and underwhelming. Five tiny pieces of tuna with a drizzle of sauce. I'd never pay however that dish costs if I was ordering it myself in a restaurant. Definitely much more of an appetizer than an entrée. I was, of course, super excited for the steak. I usually get my steak prepared medium, but our waiter recommended the fillet mignon to be done medium rare and was I glad I trusted his expertise! My fillet mignon came out perfectly--just divine. The best fillet mignon I can remember. A good portion--10oz, nice and satisfying. A superb cut of meat--just divine. Perfectly tender, juicy and flavorful. Spot on seasoning. Perfect, crunchy sear all around, and tender and delicate flesh inside, once you cut it. Nothing that I'd change about this dish!Tip: listen to your waiter and get fillet mignon medium rare. My friend got hers medium well and it was too dry and not suitable for that cut of meat. Listen to your waiter when choosing the temperature of your steak! I'm so glad I did, instead of getting my steak medium, like I always do.Sides were served family style, although the portions were not big--just enough to share amid 2-3 people. Mashed potatoes were creamy, but I'm not a fan of mash so can't give an accurate review there. French fries were okay, nothing extraordinary to remark on. Brussels sprouts with fries bacon and onions were tasty, but the smallest portion out of the three, so we had to ask for seconds. Dirty martini was not my taste, but it came with two olives stuffed with bleu cheese, which was a cool way to spice up our Friday noon. We got a bottle of red and it was delicious and aromatic--wish I remembered the name.Now to the desserts. Two scoops of raspberry sorbet were too sweet. Pass. NY style cheesecake (a tiny piece) was bland and too sweet. I cannot resist sugar in any form, but even for me that was too much--all I could taste was tasteless sweetness and nothing else. Brownie a la mode came with a scoop of ice cream on top. Decadent and heavy on chocolate--was pretty filling.Overall, would return for the superb fillet mignon and service."

Truly the best steak in town, far better than Sparks, Keens, Del Frisco and many other well known steakhouses. The secret to order super tender, order the ribeye ""rare plus"" and order the sautéed mushrooms. Amazing combination.What surprised me, I ordered off menu for the kids, pasta with meatballs. Holy smokes, that's the most tender meatballs I've ever had. The pasta is cooked perfectly, the sauce is made perfectly. Best pasta and meatballs I've ever had, even better than some famous Italian restaurants I've been. But the most toughest critic, my kids... they devoured it. Very impressed, they should make it a regular menu item."

The food came with plenty of sauces a green and a chipotle sauce as well as radish and lots of lime This was a treat. It cost about 19.00 pretty reasonable.

They load up on thick Oaxaca cheese which was impressive because not many places provide that. Definitely recommend their rice, it's delicious and flavorful. The burritos are good too!"

I called in advance their main source of ordering online was through chownow, but I didn't want to create an account. Picking up the phone to order was quick and simple. We ordered the following, chicken and steak burrito, beef empanadas, and tostadas. Their pricing is extremely reasonable, with the price of around $11 a burrito. Their portions are generous, and the food was still hot when picked up. Empanadas were so good, highly recommend.Tostada was good but I think due to the pick up the shell was not crunchyThe burrito was huge, it seems the chicken used came from an rotisserie chicken, and the steak was a bit dried (-1)"
1452,II5JBZFOSlaROP6BgioEig,12/31/2021,5 star rating,"I happened to be in the area when hunger struck and wanted to try this popular taqueria that now has multiple locations. Although they seem to be more on the traditional side, they advertised their newly added menu item: the birria taco. The restaurant is on the small side and was devoid of customers when we entered but it is located in a fairly remote area, close to residential blocks. We were grateful anyway to have the place to ourselves for social distancing purposes. Prices are extremely fair here and the whole place has a very homey feel, like you're having dinner at your friend's grandma's house. I ordered a medium horchata, consome for dipping my tacos into, and 2 birria tacos. My boyfriend ordered the same and a plate of chorizo nachos. The nachos were sooo good. I could tell the chips were freshly fried and each was loaded with smashed black beans, melted mozarella, pinto beans, and chorizo chunks. I loved the chorizo and how they had a little salad and jalapenos on the side to  cut through the fattyness of the nachos. Truth be told, I almost forgot about my birria tacos. I've only had these twice, and it's no surprise that Homemade Taqueria's were better than the ones I got at a Mexican taco bar. The birria taco was so big that eating one alone would have sufficed. The richness of the consome soaked into the brisket of the taco was very satisfying on this cold winter night. I kept dipping my taco into consome and their green sauce to accentuate the flavors more. By the time I finished my first taco, I was stuffed. The only dessert I wanted was the rest of my horchata. For those who haven't tried horchata, theirs has a strong vanilla flavor interlaced with spices. In other words, it's a delicious addition to your meal here.Great food, safe dining, and great prices. A must visit for anyone who loves Mexican food."

It's definitely worth it to get the combo because the consome is $2.50 itself and the tacos are $4 each. The minute we opened the container, my eyes were the size of saucers, as was the tacos (haha jk). But seriously, was really astounded by the size of the crispy (double) taco shells plus the amount of meat each one had.In fact, it was so packed that with each bite, I'm unsure whether more went in my mouth or more slipped back into the plate! I wasn't expecting crispy shells, but those were so delicious. The meat itself, pre consome dip, is quite moist and flavorful, definitely not too salty. After dip, each mouthful is full of meat, juices drooling down your throat and chin, plus that crunch from the shell. Tasted like carnitas tacos to me as well haha. Highly recommend these, and you can definitely share since you might not end up finishing everythingNortena Torta ($9): realllly good, best eaten hot! Quite stuffed, there's plenty of meat - this one is stuffed with steak and bacon. Jalapenos, tomatoes, avocados and their hot sauce and mayo really made this a juicy and flavorful torta.Beef Empanada ($2): would have to pass on this one. It's a pretty small and thin empanada. The shell is good, but I didn't like the meat inside. Not too moist, and the flavor was off. Tasted like beer? Some kind of alcohol was in there and that threw me off.The regular tacos aren't as great compared to the birria, and I actually would just go somewhere else for basic tacos haha:Grilled Fish Tacos ($4): so much shrimp here! It's the baby shrimp but it's still juicy and has a good flavor, loved the chunk of avocado in this oneChorizo Tacos ($3): least favorite, the chorizo just isn't good and it's a pretty limp taco"
1454,II5JBZFOSlaROP6BgioEig,9/18/2021,4 star rating,"the birria tacos were not what I expected, but they still tasted good. The tortilla was a soft shell but it was fried that it turned crispy. The shell was soggy in some areas and super crunch in others. I wasn't sure if the birria tacos were suppose to come with the soup or suppose to be ordered separately, but I didn't get the dipping soup sauce. The meat was okay. I didn't really like Campechano tacos. The sausage had a cinnamon flavor which I didn't like too much. The tacos are bigger than most places! But overall this satisfied my taco cravings."

They were very flavorful and these would definitely be part of my usual order. I also got the chicken which was a little dry and the al pastor which was a little too sweet and heavy on the pineapples for me. The tacos ranges from $2.95 to $3.95 which isn't bad at all. Also got the beef & chicken empanadas and the beef is definitely my favorite of the two. Again, the chicken was too dry for me.

I'm insulted a little bit, but I also agree. The crq is heavy but beyond delicious. It's like an amazing grilled ham & cheese sandwich with an egg and prosciutto on top.

I love how small the almond croissants were, which allowed for a full flavor profile with each bite. And don't worry, it comes with two to an order! The fresh squeeze OJ was definitely worth the $11; it comes with lots of pulp, which I love.My fiancé ordered the Jamon Cru, which he said was delicious. The eggs were so fluffy, it reminds me of the Gordon Ramsey eggs we make at home. There was also a good portion of jamon. And last but not least I got the waffle sandwich, which was our favorite. It was so simple yet so delicious. The waffle was quite soft and buttery, and I generally like a crispy waffle to start, so I was pleasantly surprised. The bacon and egg balanced the sweetness of the waffle just right. I honestly cannot wait to go back once I'm back in NYC!"

Noise was average but the volume was a little less by the bar I guess coz it was facing away from the rest of the crowd. Service was pleasant and efficient.We got our almond croissant first and it was one of the best that Ive had in a while - some crunch from crust and the almonds but soft in the center. And there is sweetness there too which I liked! The latte was very good and I also liked their Cafe Meil (has cinnamon). For the food we got the Jambon Cru which had nice soft scrambled eggs! I love the texture and the mild clean flavor of the eggs. Add with some pepper, prosciutto and parmesan and it was actually a lovely breakfast. The Belgian waffle was surprisingly good too! Fruits were fresh, waffle was soft and the creme fraiche actually elevated that flavor! The breakfast/brunch menu was really just something simple but I liked how they actually executed the whole dish and kept the flavor just so pleasant. Thats probably why I ended up giving the five stars after debating if it shouldve been a four. Anyway hubster agrees a 5 star is in order and so there you have it."

This spot is perfect for an early morning espresso and good company. I came here during my last visit to NYC with a friend and sat outdoors with some breakfast to share and it was perfect. Service is always great and if it's not too busy you'll be seated without a reservation easily. Don't miss out on this gem!

The interior is designed with a French theme, with menu items written in French and wine selections displayed on a mirror on the wall.We ordered an Americano and a dirty chai oat milk latte, both of which were satisfying. The main dishes we tried were the Croque Madame and Eggs with Smoked Salmon. The Croque Madame consisted of Gruyère cheese, classic ham, and a sunny side egg, while the Eggs with Smoked Salmon were served with eggs, capers, and salmon on a slice of bread.Although portion sizes were small, the quality of the food was good. The atmosphere was lively and bustling, but it could get noisy. Overall, Buvette is a charming and casual spot for brunch with a French twist."

Buvette has been on my yelp bookmarks for who knows how long and I am so glad to say we finally tried it!We ordered:Fresh squeezed orange juice - while insanely expensive ($11), the orange juice was delicious. It was so pulpy, sweet, and refreshing!Croque Monsieur - my favorite of the meal! The edges of the cheese crusted perfectly, the insides were melty and the ham was chopped for easy eating, and it was overall just so yummy. It was very bready, but also very filling, and the pickles were perfect to cut through the heaviness.Saumon Fumé - the smoked salmon on this dish was really good but other than that, it wasn't that special to me. The eggs were kind of plain but it went well with the saltiness of the salmon. This restaurant is a bit pricey, but ultimately you're also paying for the atmosphere and the aesthetic. And the good service!"

1468,dfSlRuVfifkYExogBtkFyw,7/16/2022,1 star rating,"I went to Milo's Yard for a friend's birthday (have never been before). I walk in, go to the bar, grab a couple beer + shots for my friend and I, then go sit down after checking the place out. We like it! We're talking about how cool/chill of a place it is and the nice atmosphere. As we're hanging out and talking (maybe 30 minutes), I notice people who work there keep coming back to where we're sitting checking for empty glasses. My thoughts are ""wow they're really attentive and keep the place clean"". They keep coming back it seems every 5 minutes so now I'm kind of confused. Next thing you know, a woman comes up to my friend and I and asks to look inside her bag. We're confused on what's going on so she grabs her bag and the woman is looking behind the booths and the corner where we're sitting. We're sitting in plain sight of the bar by the way (probably the most visible corner in the bar). The woman then says something about a deli bag and ""drinking pace"". She walks off and my friend and I are so confused. I explained to her what the woman said and we were really offended. When I asked the woman (the manager, she said she was) what the problem was, she told me that our drinking paces were slow and they were accusing me of drinking out of a deli bag or refilling my beer or something of the sort. I've never even thought to do something like that before.  While we're talking, she said ""we thought we saw a deli bag but there wasn't one.. unless it was thrown away"" STILL ACCUSING ME. Our drinking paces were ""slow"" but we just took a shot at the bar and were half a beer down in less than 30-40 minutes. It may be completely unrelated but I just happened to be the only black person in the bar. The manager and the bartender who accused me of this apologized but the whole situation was so ridiculous that I had to leave a review. This is how people are treated at this bar. Paying customers. If they thought such things, check the cameras before you accuse people who bought drinks and tipped. Crazy."

Be able to knock back some drinks and play some games.  I bumped into a friend a couple weeks ago and joined her and her friends to a fun game of cards against humanity! We even got a table by the window on a Sunday night. They food options are limited for pescatarians. There's veggie samosas with a tamarind chutney or the classic mint chutney. It's a starchy, greasy snack but at least it's warmer than the kettle chips. I am not a big fan of the veggie patty. I wish they would just buy veggie dogs and make veggie Chicago dogs. The meaty ones always look great! And I  have a weakness for veggie Chicago style dogs with cold beer and a game of pinball! Hint, hint, nudge, nudge. Great space for groups and it looks like a patio for summer fun. I like bouncing from Bierleichen and this place when I'm in the neighborhood.

Their menu is simple, breakfast done right, and it's inexpensive to say the least.Gory's is not fancy and it doesn't need to be. It's exactly what this neighborhood needs. Inexpensive good tasting meals that can help me get through the day. So for example, I went to Rolo's on Saturday. Spent $54 and was not full at all. About 30 minutes after we left, I found myself looking for something to snack on. I decided to head over to Gory's early afternoon and ordered their Hungry Man Special. This is it a insult to Rolo's, this just means Rolo's portions were small and pricey for this neighborhood. Anyone who grew up or worked in Ridgewood would know, there's no reason to charge $24 for a friggin cheeseburger in this hood.Back to the Hungry Man Special, it comes with pancakes or French toast, I opt for pancakes because it's nice and fluffy and airy. It's not a dense pancake and I'm not even a pancake type of person (I prefer waffles). Choice of bacon or breakfast sausages, home fries, and your style of eggs which I chose over and easy. For the record, I been to Gory's twice. Once during morning time, the bacon was nice and crispy. This time was in the afternoon. The bacon tasted like it was cooked in a batch and was just added on. They got the eggs right, runny yolk. The home fries are filling but I wish they would burn the potatoes just a little bit more for that crispy outside.Verdict - you can't go wrong for $11. No long wait, food served fast, satisfying meal that would put a smile on your face. I'm still trying to dissect what went wrong at Rolo's because I had high hopes for that spot. I am super glad a place like Gory's exist nearby to fulfill my hunger."

One thing I wish they had was kale noodles! Delivery was a little slow via GrubHub on a friday afternoon but I was happy to see 2 very packed bowls. Def hit the spot and glad I didn't order sushi. They are generous w their portions, my avocado was a chunky slice (1/3 of a full avo), plenty of crab salad and seaweed salad in the Hawaiian and I usually ask for sauce on the side an forgot but I wasn't mad bc all the flavors were really good and fit together nicely.Finally a poke spot near me that I like the options and customization.

This week, I had a Poke bowl from the highly rated Poke City, located on Livingston Street in Downtown Brooklyn / Brooklyn Heights (depending upon who you ask). I tried :1) 2 Choices of Poke Bowl. I selected the 1/2 brown rice 1/2 sushi rice - a little bit naughty and a little bit nice. Both were good. Also, the raw Yellowtail and raw Salmon plus toppings. I liked the Yuzu Jalapeño sauce. I added some of my own soy sauce though. Overall good quality Poke bowl. At 14.99 (aka 15 dollars), they could have included a little more of the Yellowtail topping. The bowl was fresh and filling. I love that they allow you to customize the rice choices - and don't charge extra for brown rice. 2) California Roll - good, California rolls are pretty standard, nothing exciting. The Poke Bowl was the highlight - delicious and the preparation looks appetizing/ attractive. Recommend!"

I want to rate it like a 3.5 or 4I ordered for delivery and it came well packaged and everything was correct The food isn't too bad. They give a LOT of rice. My down downfall is that there is not enough sauce at all. Like the amount of sauce you get is not enough to well coat the fish. The toppings are not mixed in the sauce as well. The bowl itself would've been a 4/5 if it all just had a loooot more sauce and if it the toppings had sauce. With out the toppings being mixed in sauce and fish having so little sauce it was like eating bland fish and veggies over rice. Sucks that if you want extra sauce you have to pay $1 on door dash for a little container. I would come back but would just ask for a lot of sauce

I chose brown rice as my base. It came with spicy tuna, crab meat, salmon, avocado, edamame, onion crisps, seaweed salad, mango, cilantro, cucumbers, corn, green onion, masago, sesame seeds, and spicy mayo.

1502,sPQJUmqKDoGkEHPhRjS4ag,11/24/2022,5 star rating,"Score for the area as there is literally no other good poke spot around here I have had so far (Ten Ichi Market has better fish but cold rice so nope.) Also I would not recommend the eel bowl much. Too sweet.This is the local good poke spot. They also have sushi for relatively reasonable prices but I've never gotten it as I just prefer getting poke here. As noted by another reviewer, there's only a $2 difference between the two protein and three protein option which I am fine with as the crab (or rather surimi) salad is essentially just an add-on then. They also have an octopus salad to add-on which I am always worried about as cross-contamination would likely result in very bad times but luckily that hasn't happened and they are pretty clean inside. My only complaint is that I wish that there was an option like some other poke spots to specify how much of the sauce they put on (light/medium/heavy) as I would describe the sauce to be the ""light"" level from other spots so for people who love sauces, ask for extra on there. Most of their add-ons are also free which is a nice touch as some of the add-ons such as shiitake mushrooms are extra at other poke spots. I generally get tuna, salmon, and crab salad or yellow-tail with a mix of toppings and either the sriracha mayo or the yuzu sauce. Outside of the sauce issue, I would mostly compare this spot to Pokeworks outside of them not having sushi burritos (which I don't care and I don't think they should that anyway.) Similar quality fish. I've been here too many times to not rate them highly. They also have a nice slightly sweetened oolong tea tea brand (pretty positive it's a brand I have bought in Chinatown) for I believe three bucks."

1504,d8QUxd7xfKS4-SUk-uPX4g,11/30/2022,5 star rating,"This is an intimate, all vegetarian/vegan Middle Eastern restaurant serving affordable, flavorful, and delicious food in a quiet, industrial area of Brooklyn's East Williamsburg. There's limited interior seating space and some outdoor seating, but when we went on a weeknight for dinner, it was pretty empty. The inside had interesting vibes-- dim lighting, indie decor, and folk/indie/rock instrumental music playing in the background. You seat yourself and order at the front counter. The night menu is less expansive than the day menu (which ends at 4pm), but it still offered a diverse and delicious selection. I tried the following items:- Pan-fried Halloumi Sandwich: A really flavorful, tasty, and filling sandwich! The bread was so perfectly toasted-- crispy, yet fluffy. The filling had a great mixture of textures: soft roasted eggplant paired with a firmer pan-fried halloumi cheese block. - Masabacha Hummus with 2 pita pockets: All the ingredients in this dish-- tahini, chickpeas, spices, and s'hug-- provided such a delicious combination of textures and flavors when mixed together: earthy flavors combined with creamy and gritty textures. The pita pockets were also warm and soft. Super filling and tasty!My friends ordered the Seitan Chorizo and Vegan Majadra Plate. Both really enjoyed them! The seitan was very flavorful and delicious and the lentil/rice in the Majadra plate had a great flavor and spice profile. The price was also good, especially for how filling and satiating the food is: sandwiches were between $10-14, plates are ~$14, and hummus is ~$12.

I ordered the falafel sandwich and I've gotta say it was extremely dry, chalky, and cold. 10/10 would not recommend."

1510,d8QUxd7xfKS4-SUk-uPX4g,12/7/2019,5 star rating,"Newtown has been one of my go-to spots for the last nine years. Wayback, when they only had the small room where the kitchen and register is. Back then, it was quiet and spooky to eat there. It was cash only, and the menu was limited compared to what it is now. I've loved Newtown from day one! I came across it on the Yelp app when I was searching for a hummus spot, so I believe this location was named hummus something before. Anyhow, I've been eating at Newtown for a hot minute now so I can tell you if it's legit or not.As I said, they've come a long way. They've got a second room; it's more spacious. The menu has more options. Now they take credit and debit cards. The bathroom is still down the hallway, the spooky hallway, and (freezing ass hallway in the winter), which is my only complaint about Newtown. All that aside, nothing but great things. If it's packed, it's never too full. At least it has never been out of the many times I've visited. The staff is friendly and chill and is not on top of you. You can sit there to eat and drink your coffee, work on your laptop, and take your sweet time, and nobody is pestering you. When it comes to the menu, the Halloumi Sandwich is my go-to dish, but the falafel is also very flavorful. 90% of the time that I visit, I order the olives and pickles because I am a big fan, and I don't know what it is about theirs specifically, but I'm obsessed. Get the hot harissa sauce to pour on everything because everything is better with hot sauce. I love visiting Newtown during the Spring and Summer months when the weather is beautiful to enjoy your meal outside. I highly recommend this place!"

Flavor well rounded, on point. I will say I wish the focaccia was toasted but this isn't enough for me to knock anything off.  Every bite was delicious. Falafel sandwich is also great and very reasonably priced. Tahini hummus also is bomb but my favorite item is their harissa. It's herby and spicy and should be sold in larger quantities so I can adorn various food items with it. Def recommend!"

A small order of Singapore Mei-Fun could NOT be finished, even by me. Lunch special styrofoam trays are packed beyond capacity and always come with pork fried rice. The woman at the counter is nice, though soft-spoken, and she will remember special requests if you are a regular. Prices are beautiful, you can easily feed two or more for under ten dollars.

I asked for a table for two and there were plenty of tables open. The lady at the counter seemed like she straight up didn't want my business. Trying to give us reasons not to stay. Said we will have to wait to get our food, because a party of 6 hadn't ordered yet, which didn't make any sense. I said I would like a seat and she ignored us and walked back to the kitchen. So we sat ourselves, it was clear to us that she didn't like the look of us because she immediately sat a white couple who came in right after us without any question or warning about how long the food would take and handed them a menu.I've seen a couple bad experiences from POC in the reviews that confirmed suspicions.

It's literally the most okayest place in bushwick. That being said, I recently had a horrible experience here and needed to share. A friend of mine, who is black, went to grab us a table on a random Thursday at 8 and was immediately told there's not room. I live next door so she just came over and we waited an hour to go back at 9. When we go back, I come in alone and immediately the woman working says she has a table available for 2... that is until my friend walked in. Then for some reason there was an issue? I'm usually not so quick to jump to the conclusion that actions are intentionally racially motivated in an area like bushwick, but the reaction was just so jarring. Then she points at our wine now and says, ""ok never mind, no wine allowed."" Now sis, we all damn well know this is a BYOB spot. So I just reply and say ""since when?"" Because I was literally just there with my sister with wine and nothing was mentioned. She then runs away and goes into the back and then comes out and says ""fine, if you want to drink wine, then cash only."" To which I then reply, ""since when?"" Because as I said, I was just there and paid with a card. Her response was ""oh you like wine? Then I like cash"" and then she runs off an just leaves us at the front basically refusing to seat us.It was such a weird experience. We of course left and just went somewhere else, but I can't help but think that this was a prejudicial reaction. If it wasn't, then it was just blatant disrespect for frankly no reason. Either way, I won't be coming back."

A simple and elegant beer bar, with great local beer options and an easy space to settle in for a while.Quality: Beer Street is an excellent beer bar that highlights the different great breweries across New York City. They had ten different options on draft and about forty or so additional bottles and cans. During my visit I enjoyed an IPA from Finback, a sour from KCBC, and a saison from Plan Bee Farm. Each was delicious and served in the correct glassware with the right amount of head. It is the small things that make a difference at beer bars and Beer Street had all those things handled.Quantity: A nice variety of draft beers with different options for pour sizes.Value: $8-$12 for a Draft Beer.Ambiance: Beer Street is a cool beer bar located in the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn. Walking down Graham Ave it is easy to miss this small spot, but it is worth seeking out. Simple, classic, and dimly lit, it is a great relaxing spot to enjoy a beer. They have the actual bar near the front and then some some high-tops and wall seating towards the back. The music was alternative and indie rock, but played at a low volume to encourage conversation.Crowd: A busy spot on Friday evening. Every seat was filled with folks enjoying some delicious beers. Service: One bartender for a busy bar, but still took the time to make sure each beer was perfect.Parking: Extremely limited street parking in the area."

Strong focus on NYC breweries (Return, Fifth Hammer, Transmitter, Gun Hill, Other Half, Folksbier). The music is impressive (deep cuts of jazz and soul tonight--Josef Leimberg, Leroy and Rocky, Donald Byrd) and worth lingering around just to listen to.. Controlled by the person behind the bar and not an algorithm. Very small number of patrons (five on a weeknight at 9:00pm). They also offer a lot of different small pour tastes for just $3-4.

After a feast at Masha and the Bear and treats at Blue Stove it was time for libations. (I know, we live life to the fullest) Oh hello there stranger!? Welcome to Beer Street! This is my kinda street! With rivers of delicious, variety of beers!The place is painted white, it is long and the seating is very smart is utilizing the unique space. There's  cool old vintage beer memorabilia on the walls. The beer dispenser looks like an old school church organ. The bartender informed us that it's used for filing growlers. Rawr! Here's a growl in thirst. My brother is cider only. And he was happy to be informed of the 5 options. I on the other hand love me some IPA's.  Though this is the kind of place to venture to different styles from sours to smoky and the place to be introduced to different local breweries. I think I may have spotted some sort of donut stout. Interesting. Beer for breakfast? I'm not opposed to it. When we made our selections the bartender did a water rinse in the glass and did a strong shake to remove excess water. And our beers were served in funny wine glasses. The wine glasses protect the beer from warming up with our body heat and surprisingly brought out the aromas of the beer whenever you took a sip. How interesting. The beers here are pricey and they do have different sizes. In some ways I don't mind paying a little more and supporting local businesses and the flavors  are becoming so developed that beers are being treated more like wines these days. And rightfully so, the complexities of beer have been underestimated long enough. Let's here it for beer!! Hip hip hooray! Prost!"

Well, whomever that bartender is that was working Saturday night should rethink working with the public. From the moment my friends and I walked in; he was a bit standoffish. Anyway, I ordered two small pours. The pour sizing had no rhyme or reason. One was barely half and the other wasn't full, but maybe a bit more than half. Also, the second was not the beer I ordered. I was just going to drink it, but my friends convinced me to go back.So I did and was super nice because I figured it was a misunderstanding. He said, ""oh, I thought you asked for the stout. I'll get you the other one."" Dumped the stout, got me another one. Again, not a full pour, but definitely a half pour this time. Well, at the end of the night he charged me for a full pour.His reasoning? If you don't say the size, they default to the full pour. FYI, you all! Yet, he never gave me a full pour OR a half pour of my first one. When we got there, there were maybe 10 ten people in the bar. When we left only a couple, so it definitely was not busy. No one in my party was rude. We were all polite so the attitude was completely unnecessary. I still tipped him and left without fighting with him, but I will never go back. My friends will never go back. I was excited for this place to be in Brooklyn, but I'd rather take my patronage to the local breweries directly or go into Manhattan to Haymaker or As Is. I love beer, but I'll drink a 'gansett at Tom & Joan's up the street if I'm in the area rather than come back. So disappointing!"

Since it was my 1st time, i opted for the popular Ostmanthus Honey Oolong Tea for my husband (cold) and the Pudding Oolong Tea with Fresh Milk (hot) - both were so, so tasty and we actually ended up swapping on the ride home. Although i'm actually a huge fan of milk tea, i've never enjoyed it with boba - something about the tapioca texture tends to ruin the drinking experience for me. Nevertheless, i actually really enjoyed the oolong tea w/ the pudding as the pudding pieces were not intrusive and complimented the tea flavour really well.Overall - will def be back.

Hojicha latte; 5/5: LOVEEE LOVE THEIR HOJICHA IT DOESNT DISAPPOINT!!  I love how it's fresh and it's not overly sweet and you can def taste the roasted green tea. I always get it 50% sugar and boba because it doesn't feel like you're drinking so much sugar and it just satisfies the cravings. I would highly recommend this drink! Tip; get it with boba ! Their boba isn't over cooked like how some boba shops are and it's just right!Passion fruit green tea; 5/5 as well!! It's super refreshing when you get it during the summer time and it's not sour at all. Passion fruit green tea also never disappoints~! It's my number one recommended refresher~! Service; 5/5; Everyone is super nice and attentive. They never delay your order and always makes it consistent. Ambience; 4/5; they always keep it clean and their decorations are always so cute.

Honey Osmanthus Oolong Tea - Refreshing yet you can really taste the depth of the Oolong, which is a plus for me. (Tips: I order my drinks 30% sugar, only.) Let me introduce you guys with a seasonal drink even though it's almost $9.  If it everrrrr comes back during the summer, TRUST MEEEE when I say this, it is soooo worth it! HOJICHA ICE CREAM DRINK - Although it has a scoop of Hojicha ice cream in it, they serve it without a spoon . As per the staff, ""you drink it"". I know they might have sounded a little obnoxious, but they are right, you DO drink it!!! And once you dooooooooo, I ensure you, you're going to love it! Please, just take my money! Service: For most parts, the staff are pretty nice, except for one incident. One or two of them made eye contacts with each other, indicated a customer might have came in 15 minutes before the closing time to pick up a huge order. And hey! We've all been there, giving that these staff are most likely mainly college students and probably don't have enough experience in the real world. Working in a retail myself, I totally understand where they are coming from. Hence, I wouldn't hold this against my experience in Chun Yang, and I really do enjoy their drinks!

We ordered four drinks: a Honey Osmanthus Oolong Tea, Taro Sago with Fresh Milk, Oolong Tea Latte with Purple Rice Sago, and Cosmo Guava Mango Orange Smoothie. Some of the drinks have fixed sugar and/or ice levels with the Taro Sago with Fresh Milk being one of them. This drink was enjoyable and not overwhelmingly sweet. Fresh Milk is the main character and Taro Sago is the side kick. Service was efficient, but could be improved on. It may be worthwhile asking customers if they would like to add any toppings to their drinks."

It was good and but I'm not sure if it was worth the price, as the average price of bubble milk tea (size L) is around $6/$7 in the area. It was $8 and did not contain bubbles/tapioca. It also had a single scoop of ice cream. It was worth trying, but I don't think it'll be the new hype like brown sugar milk tea did. Tl;dr-visited for the osmanthus oolong ice cream tea, okay but a little pricey. Worth the experience."
1559,3Sm0BAPqrV-Q1A_FGWlEhQ,9/30/2021,4 star rating,"Chun Yang is my go to for quality bubble tea. It is one street away from the 8 Avenue train station. The staffs are very nice and the drinks are prep very quickly (note: this is based on every visit there wasn't a long line).My usual is either the red bean with fresh milk (Horizon Whole Milk) and the Grapefruit green tea. The red bean with fresh milk which is a very typical red bean drink you can usually get with a more quality taste to it (I'm thinking maybe it's the Horizon milk they use), it also set so no changes can be made with sugar, ice or size. I also like the grapefruit green tea but it does get a bitter from the grapefruit skin and the tea flavor. The only down side for me is the store is very small so it's a quick grab and go (so no hang out here!)  and the drinks can get pricey it's usually around $7-$8 but most bubble tea prices are getting there."

1561,1dFOF1HPaThSCsdiqR7DrA,2/16/2023,4 star rating,"I always thought finding good decently priced Chinese food was a difficult feat in Midtown. Land of Plenty proved me wrong with their variety of great lunch specials. Although they market themselves as a sichuan restaurant, they also offer some other Chinese dishes that are not just spicy. For their weekday lunch specials, for ~$11-13 (excl tax and tip), you can get good Chinese food with generous portions. They also have various vegetable only dishes for any vegetarians out there. I loved my Spicy Fish Filets w. Silky Tofu - it was delicious and they were able to make it less spicy for me upon my request. Each lunch special comes with a rice and a choice of appetizer. I will say not all items are made equally - I got their Singaporean Chow mein, and it didn't have enough wok hei and I could taste the curry powder. Overall, a great lunch spot!"

I love Chinese food so I was very excited.Food: 5/5I ordered four dishes with two bowls of rice and the bill came below $60. Which is honestly never happens at a sit down in Midtown East.We ordered Dan Dan Noodle, Mapo Tofu, Szechuan Pork Dumpling with Chili Soy, and Hot and Sour Cellophane noodles. Honestly, for $9 the Dan Dan are definitely worth it! I will definitely come back for  Mapo and Dan Dan.All in all, I definitely plan to going back for dinner and lunch sometime!"

Husband had sliced chicken and baby eggplant, same as last time and he demolished it! I decided that soup could vanquish the last remnants of a cold, so I ordered assorted mushrooms with baby bok choy, roasted garlic, and dried shrimp (that's those tiny ones, which of course soften in the hot broth) in broth.   There were ample mushrooms and heads of baby bok choy as well as at least half a bulb's worth of roasted garlic cloves. Filling, satisfying, tasty!"

The Sichuan peppers really cleared up the sinuses. General Tso has very juicy, tender chicken pieces which is great, as many Chinese restaurants I've had tend to be dry and stringy. The Chicken and Broccoli was good. I appreciate the amount of broccoli that was provided. All dishes were served with white rice as well."

We got a reservation because whoOoO has time to wait in line these days??The ambiance and food were both a 5. Delicious, cool/dark lighting, and the food runners were kind and cleaned the tables in between courses. I was mildly shocked by the very poor service. We had to ask the waiter to take our order and we had to ask him for the check. Thankfully he dropped us off a pitcher of water so we were able to refill our waters throughout the meal. Once the check came I had to ask someone to pick it up. I'd probably come back because the food was good, but the lack of urgency/acknowledgement of us as people (lol) would lead me to go somewhere else first."

I was seated in the corner of the underground wine cellar by the wall. After my food arrived (pappardelle), I began to eat. I noticed a medium-large sized pregnant roach from my peripheral vision emerge from some type of vase/pottery on my left about a few mins into eating. I waited for someone to come by downstairs to mention it to them but it seemed like most of the staff was occupied with customers upstairs. 5 minutes later and two baby roaches also emerged. One of them crawled onto my table and into the bread plate. I was disgusted at this point and quickly went upstairs to inform a staff member. They were worried but didn't seem shocked by this information and quietly moved me from my seat downstairs to one upstairs so other guests in the cellar wouldn't notice. I wasn't offered an explanation or a replacement of my food, although I didn't think any roaches crawled into my main dish. I decided to stay for god knows why and ordered the tiramisu, trying to enjoy whatever was left of a ruined meal. I was offered the main dish on the house at the end of the meal (and not the dessert). I should've immediately left after I saw the roaches as I've never had an experience like this at a single one if the hundreds of restaurants I've been to. STAY AWAY FROM THI PLACE."

Highly recommend this-Plenta: Would pass on this - the smell was very off-putting for the majority of us and we were not a fan of the texture-Gamberetti: The shrimp was really good, the flavors went really well with the shrimp and the shrimp was perfectly cooked. -Fettuccine: This was just alright, nothing special. The pasta was perfectly cooked but the flavor was just alright -Linguine: Highly recommend this; the flavors were so good together. -For Dessert they gave us: tirasmisu, chocolate cake and panna cotta - the best one was tiramisu in my opinion.Overall cute spot for a date and the food was pretty good!"

We weren't even in there an hour when we were asked if we want dessert. (We didn't, went elsewhere.) Food was decent but I was so uncomfortable in that place that I don't think I'll ever return.

1618,Njr_f1J5Pve35OyPdBljVA,3/21/2022,5 star rating,"TIP: Request seating in the wine cellar, much better ambiance, more spacious and a little quieter than the upstairs dining room, and you get to sit among some cool wine bottles.5 People shared the following appetizers:  Burrata (great), Gamberetti (good),  Polenta (the mushrooms were a great addition), and a Caesar Salad (loved the authentic anchovies dressing).For a main I had the linguine (house made squid ink linguine with shrimp, cherry tomatoes and Calabrian chili peppers).  It tasted great, used the fresh bread to wipe my bowl clean.Pet Peeve Warning: shrimp were served with tails and shells on them, meaning the diner has to battle with a fork and knife to get to their protein and/or use your fingers which either way is a major downer for me.  I see no culinary value in serving them this way instead of fully cleaned/shelled."

We ordered the bucket of tiger beers, these came already opened and tasted flat.For appetizers, we got curry puffs and roti. The curry puffs were okay, the roti (and particularly the sauce served with it) was one of the best items of the day. For entrees, we shared Singaporean noodles, the chicken rice dish, the fried rice dish. The noodles used a frozen seafood medley which was disappointing. The one fresh shrimp was good. The fried rice was the best of the 3. Service was brief but we weren't left wanting for anything and they were polite. Overall, food quality was below expected."

We ordered the salty egg prawns, Singapore Hokkien mei noodles, and Singapore laksa. The salty egg prawns were probably our favorite, despite being super messy. The salty egg flavor came through and the chunks of egg in the sauce, along with fresh cut cucumbers were perfect.My biggest qualm with any restaurant is when they bring all your food at once AND there is no table space. It just feels very rushed when this happens. We got our laksa right after we started our first prawn and the noodles came out a few minutes after. It was a game of how to not knock stuff over. The laksa was good, had what I'd consider ""medium spice."" The bowl looks small but they packed in enough noodles, broth, and fishballs! The hokkien mei noodles were very good, nice mixture of the rice and egg noodles. Be sure to pour in the vinegar (I think it's vinegar) and spice to your liking. Overall food was good, maybe a tad expensive but the vibes were super cute so it's what you expect. But service could've been a little better."

I'm guessing they are catering to the area...What we got: Satay Ayam : sauce was pretty good Singapura Calamari: bland no flavor/ says it's spicy but definitely not. They had more crispy rice pieces vs actually calamari. Nasi Lemak: okay...Singapore Noodle: This was also supposed to be spicy but just tasted like sweet coconut broth. Noodles were good and the shrimp were plumped. Kaya Jam with Chinese fried dough: ahaha how was that a dessert. I couldn't imagine paying full price for each dish. Service was good, we went on a slow day so there wasn't that many people. The place was cozy and intimate. Would I come back to try the chili crab or other dishes probably not."

Could easily feed four people, but my boyfriend and I put a pretty good dent in it and took the rest home (made for great crab fried rice a day later hehe). It's also pricey - I think ours was $115 - but definitely worth it.

I chose Laut Sigapora as the place to have my best friend's annual holiday dinner, and the food, service, and experience far exceeded my expectations. Laut Sigapora has charm and sophistication that can't be denied. It is clear from the elegant decor and artistic touches, and aromatic smells one can't help but imagine themselves being on the streets of Thailand or Singapore. Laut Sigapora got a lot right, but I was incredibly impressed with each flavorful dish. I was equally dazzled by the presentation of the food. I compliment the chef, staff, and management for bringing a taste of Asia to the East side of Manhattan. I can't wait for a return and try the spicy crab."

I've actually been to Singapore before and this was so reminiscent of my experience there. The ambiance was what I would call fancy casual. I wouldn't come in hear with sweats or a t-shirt, but jeans and a nice top would suffice! I recommend making reservations ahead of time. We had made them in advance and we were seated promptly when we got in, which I appreciated. When we were seated, the server was very kind and answered all of our questions. She even gave us input on her favorites (which ended up being some of our favorites too). Here are the few dishes we tried:Appetizer- Roti Telur (5/5)- A perfectly crispy roti filled with egg. The curry sauce was balanced with flavor and spice. The two together was a delight! Drink- Lychee Rose (5/5)- Hands down one of the best cocktails I've ever had. The lychee was sweet and smooth. It tasted like a summer's day on the island! Main- Black Pepper Crab (5/5)- Recommended by our server, my favorite dish of the night. The sauce the crab was cooked in was light and not over powering. This was the softest and most succulent crab I've ever had. It came with steamed buns that I dipped in the sauce and enjoyed. I will never forget this extraordinary dish.Honestly, this was an incredible 5 star experience for me. I'll eagerly get every dish I tried any day!"

I would have paid for the avocado if there was an option on Uber Eats but there isn't. They could have called me about it and I would have been okay with them charging it. Not only did they not put the avocado, there's other wraps on the menu that cost the same as this one but those have meat, cheese and avocado. So they weren't going to be losing anything. This wrap only has cheese and no dressing and it costs the same as those with meat, cheese and avocado. The message was rude. I ended up not eating and throwing away the wrap.Fast delivery and the food is consistent. My favorite is the Salsalito Turkey sandwich with curly fries. They close early so I try to catch them on my days off. They have a diverse menu that includes Mediterranean to Hispanic dishes along with usual breakfast options. They also make smoothies and natural juices. The most important aspect of all is their prices. Huge portions for a great price! Give Julia's Coffee shop a try and you won't be disappointed."

Usually I would come in order, eat, and treat every single person right. Food was usually on point.  I had to delete my previous 5 star review because it's no longer the case with this restaurant. I understand the pandemic and Covid has hit some restaurants hard and that is why I keep ordering. Always willing to pay for decent or good service and help a local business out because it is our comminity. Honestly I would give zero stars and would had asked the bank for a refund, but I won'tbecause I think the problem is not the owner's fault but part of a disrespectful staff member or just a person having a bad day. With food the most important thing for me is accuracy and cleanliness.  If a comment or statement is made and is not understood... the staff should call and ask for clarification. Never make an assumption and do whatever they want with the food. As I mentioned I would gladly pay and tip or work with the restaurant so both of our goals are met. I won't share what the staff did with my food because it will affect business. I would also order again because this has to be a ""today"" thing for this restaurant. But the owner or someone needs to make their staff accountable because we are all trying to support each other during these times. Please to the owner, if you want to discuss the incident I will gladly order again and update the review. No I don't want refunds, from a restaurant all I need is the food to be done right. If you feel the staff is not happy, speak to them... ask them what is wrong.  Take care of them.  Don't let them take it out on the customers. If this goes on, many people will keep posting lower reviews and maybe even asking for refunds. Do NOT let your staff play arround with what another person pays to eat.The key statement could be, ""don't guess for the customer"" a simple call and this review could have easily turned into a better experience"

(its a better value than the two items ala carte) the corn muffin i asked for it toasted with butter on the grill. Unfortunately nothing could save the dry corn muffin or make it better , the corn beef was standard , from can to container with a pit stop on the grill. The home fries with onions and peppers were all the same color and faded like the ghost of christmases past. And tasted like christmases past as well, lack of flavor , or any  care while making them. Somewhere along the way it seems  home fries got boring to make for some, and that sentiment is well expressed here. The platter came with toast. I got the wheat toast requesting it with extra butter. Im glad i got the extra butter, which translated to butter essence. Which to me should look like a decent amount rather than the streak of whatever was left over after you stopped giving a puck, or pat.  For the price of almost 14 dollars , (i know covid is driving the prices up) i know i probably should have made it myself, but if that was breakfast, could you imagine the sadness of lunch?

The drinks are always very good!The first was in March of 2021 - I went alone on a Thursday at 10pm. I had the downstairs area. The comics were meh, but hey - it's a free show. I agree with other reviews that the downstairs has a more dining-hall vibe than most comedy clubs. There were also one edgy comic that got a bit angry when his jokes fell flat... don't tell racist jokes in NYC then? The second time was Jan of 2022 - this time was with a group of four, Saturday at 8pm. We came 40 minutes early because we wanted to pick out seats and get in early. They had us and about 30 other people wait on the stairs until the show was ready? I get that there was another show ending soon, but maybe space them out more ... idk. The stair thing was just overall weird. When we filed in we could not choose our own seats. Bummer, because some people don't like to sit up front and be prime spot for the comics to target. We also had a claustrophobic member of the party who wanted to sit in the back or near an aisle who couldn't because the worker said we had to file in a line into the seats. No switching around.Upside was that we were in the upstairs comedy room. This one was much more of a typical comedy room than a shabby dining hall. The set of comics was great this time around too! However because they weren't watching each other's acts, many of them did the exact same crowdwork one after the other. I feel bad for some of the crowd members who were the target of the same joke told over and over again by each comic. I will definitely go back again for a cheap yet entertaining date/family/friend outing. It's just a roll of the die whether or not it'll be a good experience."

Then someone will escort you to the basement, where you will be stepping in a pile of spilled alcohol. Table is shared with multiple random people, where you will be forced to pay for 2 drinks per person, on the top of the ticket that you payed at the entrance. That would not be the problem if comedians were actually good and not students who are testing their skills, while you end up paying $100 for iced tomato sauce, dirty bathroom and sticky floor full of spilled beer. Giving only 2 stars because of the mustard guy lol who was really good, and the waitress who managed to juggle in between being on the stage and performing and then running down and serving drinks, otherwise would be 1 star.

Over the course of 90 minutes or so, about 10 performers came on. Most comedians were amateur and some funnier than others. By the 8th or so performer we were ready for the show to be over. Personally I prefer a show that doesn't involve switching up the comedian every few minutes. We were in the basement and it was packed tightly. They tell you where to sit and fill every seat. This means they could even separate you from your group and sit you in-between strangers. A young man was told to sit in the solo empty seat next to me while his friends were seated at another table. Be prepared to sit very closely to strangers. I kept wondering if the fire max capacity was exceeded or not and kept thinking most of us would die if there was a fire. The drinks were TERRIBLE. They require a 2 drink minimum per person. We ordered 2 bottles of water ($6 each) and 2 Virginia bloody Mary's ($9 each) since I'm pregnant. These were the worst Bloody Mary's I've ever had. It tasted they like used cheap tomato juice and maybe a splash of pulpy orange juice. There was so much pulp in our Bloody Mary's that we ended up not drinking them. Others at our table also complained about the lousy mixed drinks. Do yourself a favor and order a beer instead of a mixed cocktail. They also include gratuity so we ended up paying $40 to drink 2 bottles of water, plus $50 for admission for 2 to be uncomfortably cramped to watch a mildly funny performance."

Later, while waiting in line again with my full party, that same manager let a larger group in while waiting for late members of their party. With seats open, we were passed over multiple times for people with ""paid tickets.""  This would be understandable if the tickets we found on eventbrite were advertised as standby, but they were not.

First off some of the reviewers seem to fail to understand what a comedy club traditionally is. Expect a two drink minimum that is basically industry standard. Expect a little freedom for the comedians to do their routines. Comedy historically is actually an important area of free speech and unless someone is just tearing into a certain group non-stop (and they themselves not part of said group) let them have a little artistic freedom to observe cultures and poke fun of ourselves. Some back and forth will happen between the audience and the comedians. The last time I came here a few weeks ago I was roasted by one comedian for being bald but I'm not interested in being offended. Having said all that - the drinks are pretty good they are not watered down. The actual venue can really use some TLC. I understand clubs can pass with a divey or more run down atmosphere but I think it's time for the staff here to do some basic things like replace some light bulbs and clean up (or replace) the set, replace some chairs, clean the floors etc etc. Overall I will keep coming back to this location and keep an eye out for new talent trying out their routines."

The venue is small and crowded, and they make sure to fill every inch of the auditorium. So much so that there are audience members sitting on stage... the tickets were expensive, and they have a two drink minimum per customer. This wouldn't be an issue if they didn't charge $6 for a small cup of Coca-Cola. The comedians were decent this time around. There wasn't much variety as I saw some acts I saw last time, and my previous visit was in September... Some of the lights on the backdrop for the stage were out and weren't replaced out of pure negligence. They have two bathrooms which always had a massive line to enter them. I didn't try any food but it didn't look very appetizing. All in all, this wasn't a completely unredeemable experience but it wasn't great by any means."

I've trued various rolls, specialty and basic, and they're all equally fresh, well prepared and delicious. I highly recommend Bay Sushi for when that sashimi craving hits."

On seamless and Yelp, the app claims that it will take ~1hr to deliver but it's always wrong! Bay Sushi has always delivered my food in HALF the time!On top of that, the sushi itself is very fresh and doesn't taste stale at all, very supple, and is NOTHING like Bay Ridge Sushi(drier and has an odd texture and smell). Today I went to the city and had a salmon ikurabowl that was also $19 and compared to the chiraishi dinner, it was sad, under seasoned, and skimped out on the rice and fish. Bay Sushi has definitely made my standards for sushi higher. The most affordable yet quality sushi restaurant I've ever went to with the best service to boot!"

1657,NiosoLeT66--O2BOUlI_GA,12/4/2021,4 star rating,It is a decent Japanese restaurant in Bay Ridge.  Compare to other Japanese restaurants that's own by Chinese owner and chefs this place is decent and fresh fish.  I order mostly lunch here and sometimes they will do a nice party platter for me.  The staff is nice and accommodating and it is small and unassuming which is cool. I like the fact that they are not crazy expensive since some Japanese restaurants around here are a it subpar in quality but not in pricing!! Anyway it is the best around here but if I want more authentic Japanese I would go to the city.
1658,NiosoLeT66--O2BOUlI_GA,3/11/2021,5 star rating,"What a little gem this place is! I run along the water often and always passed by with much curiosity. It's a small mom and pop joint that is quaint, quiet, and small, but still packs a punch. Their sushi lunch special is THE BEST I've seen for sushi. I normally skip this part of the menu since most places only offer a handful of overdone rolls I have no interest in and a teriyaki. They have a 2-roll and 3-roll lunch special with at least 10 different options, totaling less than $15 and IT IS A STEAL. Everything was bomb. Loving that I can get a variety of sushi without spending $15 for a single roll. Also had their veggie gyoza which was yummy and fresh too. Service is very nice."

1660,1Duix1fA6zcJGdYAmBPkmw,12/18/2022,5 star rating,"OVERALL: Oh, wow. Absolutely delicious and authentic handmade dumplings. FOOD: Gotta start with the star here. The dumplings, obviously. We ordered the soup dumplings, pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, and the braised pork sliders. The soup dumplings were the crowd favorite with rich and flavorful broth and a delicious wrapper. The dough here is thicker than your usual dumpling, but I love that. I like that it has some chew to it and is denser and doesn't just rip. The pork dumplings are a classic filling and we got them seared so the bite had that nice crunch to it. The shrimp dumplings are so unique because they have corn in them as well which I enjoyed! The shrimp wasn't minced up small and felt meaty. The pork ""sliders"" (they are on the bao buns) had the most tender pork that melted in my mouth and the cucumber gives it that freshness. ATMOSPHERE: It's a small location so be sure to grab a seat if you see one open. It's a hole in the wall and I loved that you were able to see them make the dumplings right in front of you. From the creation, all the way to steaming and searing! PRICE: it's priced well at $11.95 for 10 dumplings. I will also note here that it's cash only. SERVICE: Be prepared if it's busy for a little bit of a wait but nothing crazy."

The flavors inside were nice and the texture of the dumpling was crunchy, which I enjoyed. I ordered the banana dumplings because I was so intrigued. Intrigue gone. They were very banana-y but so sweet it was almost too much. The banana flavor was too overpowering.The woman working the front desk was not very nice. It's cool how you can watch how some of the dumplings are made, but I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon."

Sometimes that's something I want in a dumpling sometimes I prefer thinner dumplings you can get at other places, but they are always well filled. I like to get the veggie options- one order seared and one steamed. The wait is sometimes longer than I'd like but how much can I actually complain when we're talking like 15 minutes. They obviously have a lot of delivery orders. One order is definitely a good amount of food but I always get two bc I'm a little fatty when it comes to dumplings. They give you a good soy based sauce I like to get 2 of per serving so I can be sauced up.CASH ONLY is important to remember."

Only found this out when I tried eating those dumplings and they were completely dry. I don't know how that happened at all bc I kept the bag straight up the whole time.. but very strange at all the soup dumplings were completely dry. The dough of the chicken soup dumplings was a little chewy and the top seemed a little raw in my opinion. The pork dumplings were also pretty thick. Cant deny this is a block of meat filling though."

Relatively inexpensive (not Chinatown level cheap, but good by EV standards) + with ample seating area inside and outside + quick service, it's a great spot for a rapid lunch. My friend ordered the shrimp dumpling and the pork one. I did sample the shrimp dumpling, which was quite tasty! It is full of corn, as well, in case that's of interest. I ordered soup dumplings, which were a tad more brittle than I am used to. But they were well worth it."

I don't believe it's advertised anywhere, but after a brief chat with the owners they mentioned that they open until 3AM on the weekends... they truly are serving the late night dumpling cravings. Otherwise, they open until 9PM on the weekdays! If this is your first time here, I highly recommend ordering the sampler. As someone who is indecisive and wants to try everything, the sampler is a great way to try six of their dumpling options. The dumplings are freshly made, and you can watch as they make your order. I will say that I've had better dumplings elsewhere. However, if you're craving late night comfort food, or want to support small family businesses... this is the place to go! They also have an option to purchase frozen dumplings to take home and prepare yourself! *CASH ONLY!"

We went to have dumplings last night somewhere different and they didn't offer soup dumplings. So you can imagine the craving was there.We waited about 15 minutes for our dumplings and we are so glad that we did! Delicious. It's so cool because inside they have a window and you can watch the staff make the dumplings. I most certainly will be back to try some of the other items on the menu. They even have dessert dumplings such as banana and pumpkin. CONS: No bathroom Not hot oil (hot mustard offered for extra charge)"

I really enjoy the veggie surprise dumplings and this definitely keeps me coming back as I can try something new every time I go.  You go up and order at the register and then grab a seat along the counter once your dumplings are ready.  The sauces here are also quite nice, particularly the hot and cool monster sauce.   Usually the dumplings are ready within 15 minutes if there isn't much of a rush."

Love the authenticity - menu is big and a little overwhelming however servers are very accommodating and friendly! We started off with the caiprinhia - a staple for this place. Drinks are delicious and have a nice kick - however cups are a little smaller so wasn't too fond. We ordered the churrasco mixto - now the menu says for 2. But realistically, this can easily be for 4 people. It comes with French fries, 2 grilled chicken breast, a nice size steak, 2 sausages, and 2 porkchops. I failed to get a pic of the sides but it also comes with rice, beans, (their version of what looked like pico de gallo) so all in all it was a LOT of food. We had our own share there plus a portion each for lunch. Flavor and seasoning was BOMB! Everything was delicious nothing dry. Bill was about $100 for everything - def worth it"

Whereas the food came out within a reasonable amount of time, the waiter was very slow to bring water. We had to ask for water three times before he came around with a bottle. The most disappointing aspect of the evening was that a 20% tip was added to our table of four without any notice. On top of that, the suggested tip amounts were still listed on the bill. If my husband hadn't reviewed the bill, we would have been tricked into tipping twice. That's not cool at all. We will explore other options in the future."

Chef William and his partner stopped by our table and talked with us. We started with the calabrasa (appetizer), then we had the garlic shrimp (appetizer) and the picanha fatiada. It was 10/10. The quality of the food was fantastic and reminded us of the food in our hometown in Brazil. If you are looking for an authentic Brazilian experience, come to Miss Favela. On Saturdays they have pagode and forró no domingo. We also had beer from Brazil and ""one of the best pudim de leite"" we have ever had."

The drinks were so good. The music was pumping. People were singing and dancing. Next time I'll have to try the food. Cash only!

Everyone was very friendly and pleasant, even those not serving our table. It was a really warm day so we opted to sit inside. It wasn't very crowded, which was nice. There were many options for seating, inside, on the attached patio outdoor or the outdoor street seating. They had the doors and windows open with fans on so even though we stayed inside, there was still and outside feel only cooler. For drinks we had the caipirinha. Unfortunately they had limited flavors that day. I believe only, mango, passion fruit and one other I can't recall. I got the classic and my girlfriend got the passion fruit. Both were excellent. My only issue were the glasses were too small. For our meal we both ordered the picanha steak ou fatiada. We saw this sizzling steak dish come out for another table and it looked so good that we asked what it was.  The server told us and also said he recommended it. It was a really good recommendation. Both entrees came with French fries and rice and beans. My girlfriend added a fried egg.  The food was spectacular. The temperature of the steak was cooked exactly how we wanted and great seasoning. The fries were shoestring and had a nice crunch. The rice and beans were nicely seasoned. Definitely no complaints. I would definitely return and would happily order the same meal or try something else."

This whole place is a complete vibe people are literally flooding out of the establishment. We came here after brunch so we just had drinks. After four pictures of Kaplan is an amazing music it was definitely a good Saturday. If you don't like to be in very crowded spaces along with bathroom lines that was the minor downfall.

Even after I showed my order on my iPhone my order wasn't handed to me, being told I should have had a print out with me. Then I was told that I had to press a button on the app confirming that I picked up the order. When I showed them my iPhone screen and asked them to show me the button, the one that possibly was the manager repeatedly said 'I don't know about that'. Eventually I was given my order when I asked who was the manager. The sliders and fries were luke warm. The order apparently was sitting at the restaurant an hour before the scheduled 11:30am pickup. There wasn't any ready to pick up notification from them until I got home. This location needs a serious Grubhub reorientation."

That's what pissed me off to the point I asked for my money back and wanted to cancel the order. The lady denied my money back!!! Said because I had already touched the order they can't issue a refund. THEY HANDED ME MY ORDER IN A DIRTY ASS BAG!! I DIDNT TOUCH SHIT BESIDES THAT DIRTY ASS BAG!! I didn't even want the order anymore especially after watching her just toss my stuff out of one bag into another carelessly as if I'm the one in the wrong!!

Nothing! So we all walked to the drive through in hopes that they will serve us pedestrians, but instead they told us that THEY WILL NOT SERVE US, but will serve only for drive thru customers Only and that the store is closed. Saying that made some of us felt like it was part a JIM CROW LAW Quote(WILL NOT SERVE) smdh . The employees there did not explain why and they were very rude.

When we finally got it, it wasn't anything that blew us away but nevertheless finished it as we were starving from our travels from CT. My friends can now say they have had it and probably will be their last time. The location was somewhat easy to access with a one way in and way out that I can only imagine gets busy during peak hours.

Western chains have slowly gained more presence in the neighborhood (#1) but ""星巴克"" tends to stand out for its location and being saturated in a sea of Chinese businesses.It couldn't be a more popular spot, as it's crowded every day. It has served as a pseudo destination for folks as a meetup spot, free WiFi haven, and the occasional overpriced coffee. Usually the youngins are all up in this joint and a healthy amount of seniors just chilling drinking nothing and casually observing folks.The setup is more akin to a nice loft than the usual Starbucks interior. The coffee counter / bar is on street level with a second floor where most folk sare sitting and overseeing everything else. Seating is tight, naturally (#3) and the staff is usually too busy to care what's happening.Bathrooms can be a little on the messy side, but then again, so can this place after the afternoon rush. The lines are never that much of a problem here, but the crowds are never ending. For folks who are driving nearby, parking is nearly impossible. Even doubled parked street side parking is risky since NYPD is always on this corner.And of course, the coffee is standard Starbucks quality. The menu isn't as extensive as other locations, but they make do for being in this part of Flushing. I foresee many future visits of ducking out from the rain with a frappuccino in hand and some WiFi enabled mobile streaming in the other.___________(#1) I'm looking at you, Skyview: yelp.com/biz/skyview-cen…(#2) Starbucks in Chinese.

She has horrible customer service and if she's treating someone who speaks English in FLUSHING like this I can't imagine how she deals with customers who don't.

This location is only opened thurs-sun which is really shocking because that's only a few days a week. I was honestly wondering how they're able to keep the business alive with that type of schedule but I found out that it's actually a small unit inside a bigger shop that houses several eateries. I placed my order over the phone the day before Christmas Eve and picked it up on Xmas eve. I ordered two small custom ice cream cakes, which was $35.99 each and 71.98 in total. The small ice cream cakes are good for 5-8 people and max three layers. I, of course, got three layers for both of the cakes so i could try more flavors. They didn't have the buko pandan and Dan tot (egg tart) flavors when I called so I got these flavors for the cakes: black sesame, ube, almond cookie, and pandan. The color of the pandan and ube looked very artificial. The pandan was by far my favorite flavor. The ube was very subtle so it was almost as if it wasn't there. I'm not a huge fan of black sesame in general but the little bits of black sesame seeds gave an unwelcome crunch to the ice cream. Too much jaw work while enjoying ice cream! The almond cookie did have a nice almond taste to it so I would definitely get that again when I stop by. It also had some tiny pieces of almond cookie in it, which gave it a nice twist. The flavor also reminded me of the medicinal taste that Seven layer cookies have. And I lovee seven layer cookies from Italian bakeries. The decoration for the surface of the cake was alright - nothing special though I think they could've done better if they gave more effort. I had two cakes, but they didn't make it easy to differentiate between the two. The flavors were written on the bottom of the plate holding the cake, so I had to unnecessarily take out the cake and look at the bottom to know. One of the cakes also had a smudged ""Merry Christmas"" written on it, sadly. But overall, it was quite fun trying the different flavors with my loved ones. Tip: you need to place your custom cake order 24 hrs in advance! Cash only!"

Would have given them 5 stars if it had actual pieces of fruit in it. They give you free samples if you ask. Unfortunately, I came in after 3 pm and they were out of durian and don tot so I couldn't taste them. One scoop of ice cream is $6.75 but totally worth it."

The branding of Flushing Ice Cream Factory is eye-catching with colorful paintings on the wall but the dragon doesn't look lovely lol The options of flavor are in a great variety and some are pretty unique, special & Asian-inspired like Egg Tart, Matcha Cookies and Pandan. We had a pint of Zen Butter which was a combination of peanut and sesame. It's okay but not our type."

So while we were in flushing we OF COURSE had to stop by. I was able to taste some -- was going between taro and pandan. And pandan is such a nostalgic flavor to me I had to get. And just like my previous (and recent) review, the girl packing our ice cream def got an arm workout and used her entire weight making sure there were no empty space in that pint container. This time I actually got a picture before devouring it all."

Service: awesome service, the waitress was super friendly and helpful when it came to answering questions. Food: We ordered dumplings and they were so yummy and juicy! As for the noodles, we ordered the fish soup, and beef hot and spicy noodles. I felt that the noodles were a little bland, and not as much flavor as I'd like. The noodles were nice and bouncy!!"

1713,QqSDuJKKmEHOEPpzCFTQFA,10/30/2021,2 star rating,"The food was just overly salty and greasy with no significant tasty flavor. Their most famous dish the beef mifen was disappointing.The soup base was just salt water flavor, beef had kind of a smell, and the pink radishes didn't do anything at all. The dumplings are a good price but the chili oil and sauce they give are cheap and don't have the same flavor I get from other restaurants. Kind of watered down and sour. Just would avoid in my opinion. Paid over 20 dollars for food that doesn't even taste delicious."

I do remember I was trying to find beef noodles after my then favorite spot started using more and more inedible bits of beef. This place was not serving your typical beef noodle soup; the flavors were a nice mix of spicy and sour with a dash of picked vegetables and plenty of broth, beef, and noodles. Also, they used rice noodles instead of wheat. Thinking of their noodles usually leads me to give them a call for pickup.But the real reason I'm reviewing this place after all these years is that I thought they had closed 2 months ago. I guess you don't appreciate something until it's gone. To my delight, I stopped by last week and they reopened; they were only temporary closed for renovations.While the price has gone up to a little over a sawbuck, the unique taste is still there. I do think the flavor is a little more overt now, with a lot of beef flavor in the broth and fewer notes of pickled and sour vegetables, but it's still very good. Also, the decor is a step up. They even added TVs on the wall if you're visiting alone."

Wasn't expecting there to be lemongrass in it, I've had gua zhou noodles before so I was expecting something different. The lemongrass made it too citrusy. It was lacking spicy and sour. The spicy lamb cumin burger was good. The bread was crispy but the meat did not taste much spicy nor cumin flavor. Husband had the regular spicy beef noodle soup which was also ok. Not worth coming back here but the hostess/waitress was super nice."

Sure if you want pancakes and French Toast, any diner can do that but this spot showcases more flavorful choices. Greek and Mediterranean style dishes like the Strapatsada which I had on this visit. The eggs, the tomato base, the feta and select pieces of olives. It was so delicious, I had to slow down my eating to enjoy it. The grilled olive oil baguette it is paired with, just completes the dish. I had to ask for more bread. Well worth it.The other new item on the brunch menu, which is the Spanish Frittata. Loaded with toppings and quite the presentation! There's avocado, there's salad, there's cheese... Yummy."

I went for the bacon cheddar and macaroni brunch special. It was very flavorful and came home with home made sweet potato fries. It came with a cup of mixed fruit, choice of  juice (I had cranberry) and coffee or tea. The coffee was quite good and I asked for almond milk ($1 upcharge). Overall, Parkeqy diner prices are excellent. $19.95 for my brunch special. Get a fountain soda free with Yelp check in. If I lived closer, I'd be a regular."

While the deliveries are always fast and the service is friendly, the food is just simply disgusting. The portions have gotten way smaller too. Breakfast arrived full of greasy oil. The home fries were inedible and even the eggs (how do you screw up eggs??) were disgusting. I specifically noted for the English muffin to be dry/ no butter, and BOTH muffins arrived literally saturated with butter. Gross. I threw most of the food in the garbage & contacted GrubHub about the food quality. Thankfully, GrubHub issued me a full refund. I'm sorry to say it, but after seeing these same food quality issues in my last few orders, I would highly suggest looking elsewhere for decent food. I wish I had just made breakfast at home today."

A quick yelp search led us here and I am so happy if did ! From the moment we entered, everyone was so nice and friendly. The customer service is on point for sure. When we wanted to switch up the music, they handed us the iPad so that we could play our favorite jams. My friends and I got the vanilla mint hookah. It pulled very nicely and the coals lasted a long time. My favorite thing about this spot was the lollipop hookah tips. I thought that was so cute and I had never seen them before. We ended up staying so long that we got hungry again. We ordered the wing sampler which was so good. It has something for everyone, but my favorite was the garlic parmesan wings. So if you're planning on stopping by just know that the food is just as good as the hookah. As for drinks, we got one of the mojito pitchers. It was good, but not very strong. However, the staff treated us to a few rounds of shots so we were definitely lit ! I'm definitely going to be back, and this may be my new spot for hookah. Do yourself a favor and check them out !"

There are two parts of this establishment. 1 that looks like an actual lounge and the other that looks like a semi-Chinese restaurant. The lounge area was already to capacity, so we had to sit in the Chinese restaurant looking area. We ordered food and drinks: Lamb and Shrimp platter Chicken Quesadilla Glass of Cabernet White sangria We also had hookah. The food and the service were good and the workers there were attentive. I would definitely consider stopping by whenever I'm in the areas. Ps--they do not honor the check-in-glass of wine deal. They stated they do not have anything to do with Yelp & wasn't able to pull the deal off. I was a little hurt lol because they should've still honored it; nonetheless, it was still a cool time."

Before sitting our group down, the server proceeded to HOUND our group about  how many hookahs and drinks we needed to order if we wanted to sit.  We were the only customers and spending was not the issue.. the staff was the only issue. So sad to see a great locale go to waste. I hope the owner is aware how much money they are throwing down the gutter. They could have turned a $200 tab into a $1k tab with our group, if only they were just nicer. Thankfully there's so many nice places around.. look elsewhere and save your money!"

I got the chicken meal. The chicken was really good. I thought it was pan friend but it's deep fried. It's not breaded so that's why I thought that. The chicken is marinated really well and the skin is super flavorful.The salad was meh. Nothing special about that. The Mac and cheese was pretty basic as well. The doughnut was really good though. Super soft and flavorful. The cinnamon bun was really good as well.The staff was friendly also. Not sure about there space being in the back w tables. I heard there was but didn't check.

For the Super Bowl, we got the fried pickles, hush puppies and collard greens as our three sides. Would pass on the hush puppies but everything else was tasty. The fried chicken was also very good, as was the side of mashed potatoes it came with.

The smell was like a wet mop, it was rather peculiar, but we made the best of it.I ordered the Big Breakfast (eggs, grits, and biscuit) and a side order of Macaroni and Cheese; my daughter had a cheeseburger. I also ordered a boozy milkshake without the marshmallows, but when it came out, it did have marshmallows, and the server tried to convince me it was whipped cream.  Ultimately, she did finally bring me a new one, but I felt like it was an insult to my intelligence.The food itself was good.

I got the cinnamon roll to go and they heated it up. It was heavenly!Cinnamon roll: 9/10Warm, fluffy, sticky, and delicious! Definitely worth the splurge but you MUST get it heated up.

We put hot sauce & honey on our chicken and it just made it all the more enjoyable. The French fries were SUPER addicting, very light, (reminded me of McDonald's fries but in a great way) and also crunchy! Mac & cheese was also great, nice & cheesy and creamy. The painkiller - we've had some pretty great painkillers and although this isn't our favorite, it still had a nice taste to it! Very balanced. It has like a retro diner style to it with some soft rock music. Small place, and it gets super packed on a regular - I would return in the future"

We ordered a chicken biscuit ($10.50) and it was so delicious. The chicken was juicy and tender. The biscuit was flavorful and the butter and hot sauce took it to the next level. While, the chicken was tasty, I had better fried chicken at other places. I feel that while the crust was tasty, it lacked flavor and spice. However, I am not saying the chicken isn't good. It's tasty and I would come back for it but, I wouldn't sit outside nor wait in the freezing cold as they had limited heat lamps for it. The chicken could have also been cut a bit better. A few bites for my friend had no meat and they had leftover biscuit.I also got the butter pecan crunch donut ($4.50). It was tasty and delicious. It wasn't overly sweet and I could see myself eating it with a side of vanilla ice cream topped with caramel.The service was decent. We had to wait a few minutes to get seated and get our order taken. However, when it came time  to pay and leave, well the waitress was nowhere to be found.

It's now or never for me these days. I thought it was much smaller than it turned out to be. I was happy to find it during my walk and there weren't any customers sitting inside. The employees were so nice and welcoming ready to assist me this morning. I knew about the price so I decided I would use my credit card. Turns out I regretted that as they don't email you a receipt and their paper receipt machine doesn't work correctly. One star off for having to screenshot my receipt. I knew I wanted to sit, relax and enjoy a small drip coffee. They said it's allowed. Let me say, this place is as beautiful as the location on Third Avenue. I had my choice of seats so I sat at the window. Tables are clean. There's also outside seating but it is humid again today. It's nice and cool air conditioning in here! Five Stars for atmosphere. The small drip coffee is $3.59 it was just as good as yesterday. Believe me no one was more surprised than me at how delicious this coffee tasted. Once again my cup was filled it to the brim without being asked. Five Stars for Consistency in Customer Service between locations.

Horus Cafe was late open on a Friday sans Belly dancers :( but we got the best falafel at this hour for my drunk crew. If you wanna get Horus Cafe in a single plate, then I would recommend the Cairo Mezza Combo. The grape leaves stuffings were sumptuous and did not let me stop with one. Can't begin to talk about the Falafel until you have tasted them! Hookahs, if you are a big group or a small one tucked away without space, the staff were kind enough to move around people and accommodate us! With one drag you would know the quality. Don't miss the Guava flavoring. I will return again and watch the live performance."

We got kabobs, quesadillas and Pistachio Baklava for dessert. The food was okay. What made our night fun was their awesome music (live DJ), and belly dancer! She was so talented and engaging. I would come back here with more friends on a Friday night. I recommend! Enjoy!"

Me & my boyfriend went into this place as soon as we walked in a waitress came up to us introduced himself and began to ask us for ID we did not even sit down as yet but he asked for our ID. We were being very observant and couldn't help but notice every other couple or person coming in they did not ask them for ID. we sat down ordered our food and the whole time the owner was staring at us very weirdly. the owner kept walking back & forth repeatedly staring at me and my boyfriend her and the waitress which was a guy. My boyfriend confronted him about the ID situation & the staring and he gave some bullsh***t excuse that "" we ask some people for ID"" is what he said which was weird to me I'm not sure if they were racist but something was off. She kept staring making us uncomfortable then I noticed she kept staring with a little Smirk on her face. After all the staring us down she Then came up to us and tried to fake ask us is everything ok I said yea & proceeded to bring to her attention why does she keep staring & it is making us very uncomfortable. This lady tried to act like we were crazy she said "" I been working here for a long time no customers ever complain"" is what she said I then proceeded to let her know first time for everything and customers did not confront you but I will she walked away . Stopped staring just for a little then went right back doing it again with a smirk. I was not paying attention but my boyfriend noticed her looking again with a smirk/laugh he got upset called her to the table and she proceeded again to try to make us feel crazy. She said ""I'm the owner why are y'all so angry""  which we were not angry or crazy she knew what she was doing. Only thing we enjoyed was the food that is it.. other than that do not go here Customer service was horrible."

1764,6cypP1EYOC36cOAI3cq9AQ,12/22/2021,4 star rating,"One of the better hookah lounges in the city. I've visited probably a handful of times already - twice in a week even. Their hookah is really good. A little overpriced but it's the city so it's expected. Their decor is also really nice, very Middle Eastern. Their service is pretty fast too. Try their chocolate cake, it's shaped like a pyramid! The only downside is - every person needs to buy food or drink in order to sit down. Even if you're not smoking. The manager, however, is very sweet and we sometimes come in large groups (once came in with a group of 10 girls) and always finds a way to accommodate. If you're can't make it to Steinway in Queens (my forever preference for hookah cause it's cheap), come here. Don't even bother with the shitty so-called hookah in Dyckman, Horus is where it's at."

The service was great- very kind and attentive. I really enjoyed that the basketball game was on. There are indoor and outdoor options available.

The meat was so tender and juicy, look at how easy it was to cut through This spot is not hard to miss. Their outdoor dining is full of tables with hookahs next to them. The decor is so nice and definitely matches their mediterranean theme. Would definitely like to go back.Follow us on Instagram, Facebook and Tiktok @halohaloeats for more food reviews!"

This place is a very short, walking distance location from our NYC apartment and I cannot say enough about it. The service is super efficient and helpful.

There was good music playing and the coffee shop had nice decor.Price: (4/5) The price was good. About $6 for a drink which seems comparable to other shops in the area. Definitely not affordable, but reasonable for the location.Food: (4/5) The maple spiced latte was my main drink. I got mine hot with regular milk. It was creamy, not too sweet, and not too bitter. The latte art on top was a nice touch. I had a couple of sips of the cold brew with vanilla. I am not a huge fan of cold brew yo begin with, but this one tasted a bit too watered down and the vanilla made it worse. Service: (5/5) The service was great. There was only one person working but the line moved very efficiently.In conclusion, I would come here again if I was in the area."

See my ratings below: Ambiance:  3/5 the space is pretty small so there isn't a place to work or sit. This helps to make it a grab and go coffee spot. Price: 5/5 standard coffee pricing that you'll find in the area. The Maple Spice Latte was $5.72 with tax. Food: 4/5 I enjoyed the maple spice latte. I got it hot (it was a cold and windy day) and it was very good. The latte art was gorgeous on top and it helped soothe my throat a bit as I was feeling a little sick. I recommend this drink for sure. Service: 5/5 there was a lone barista there and she was super friendly and helpful! She gave the suggestion to get the drink and I'm glad i listened. She made the drink quickly and the wait time was minimal. Overall, solid spot for a quick coffee but it is not a space to do work if needed."

Apo serves espresso drinks, matcha and locally made pastries from neighboring businesses, including ones from the other boroughs such as Balthazar. Currently they do not have indoor dining but do have outdoor seating, which includes Nite Nite next door. The interior of Apo is minimalistic and hipster with white tiles and greenery around.The service was fast and friendly with only one barista as this shop is quite tiny. I ordered the summer special: rose matcha latte and added oat as my milk alternative. Overall, refreshing and smooth with minimal hints of rose which is very faint and unnoticeable without the flower petals in the concoction which I would next time order a regular matcha latte without the additions. Their everything croissant was delicious with a bit of cream cheese inside. If in East Williamsburg, check out Apo if you need a quick wake-me-up. There were locals also on laptops outside in the Nite Nite outdoor seating with Apo drinks. Very chill spot.Accepts cash, card and Applepay.No bathrooms! Small space.Outdoor seating only and indoor shopping.Don't forget to pick up a stamp card.Masks not required.Drink up!"

1776,PgX9V0ZpFmqjC7XEFqGbWg,9/15/2021,5 star rating,"Apo is a cute, hip coffee shop located in the heart of East Williamsburg. Although there's no indoor seating, there's ample outdoor seating--much of which is covered. It's a great place to dine either alone or with company. The outdoor area provides great views for people watching. But make sure to scope out seating because it fills up fast as Apo is a popular destination amongst locals, which makes sense given the quality of their menu. The menu is diverse with options ranging from coffee, matcha, to chai latte with a host of non dairy options. The coffee and baked goods are equally delicious. I ordered an iced latte with oat milk and and a blueberry cheese danish. The latte cost $4.50 +$0.50 for the alternative milk option and the danish was approximately $5. Prices are relatively competitive for the area. Service is friendly, warm, and inviting. Staff and customers wore masks alike and practiced social distancing by self-limiting how many people were inside the shop at all given times. Apo provides free, complimentary WiFi for guests. I'll definitely be returning to Apo on the regular."

I usually order the vegetable pad Thai with tofu and the queens curry so delicious and consistent! Consistency is what's important to me and they always come through. I've also had other stuff on their menu which is also delicious.
1778,RmQOUUkwHDhuuh9Y6XzLsQ,7/11/2022,5 star rating,"July 2022:I've been coming here ever since I took the plunge while walking around this side of the neighborhood. The name intrigued me... Hungry? Yes! I was really happy to discover it was a Thai comfort food shop. Nothing fancy and quite hipster if you will. I prefer to get Hungry? around after work hours although late night hours after a show in Williamsburg works wonders. During the hot months, they have outdoor seating and seems to be a nice little spot for locals. I don't recall if they have indoor dining since it is really cramped inside, and I have always order take out. The food is solid for me and my partner. My go-to is the bus noodles as it's different from pad Thai but uses similar ingredients. Their Thai iced tea is a nice touch with their food. I believe they do lunch specials here. This is a Thai establishment which is a plus in the area. The employees are always nice and the service is smooth when picking up. Inside they also sell sauces and canned fruits like a grocery.Accepts cash, card and Applepay.Online order, take out and outdoor dining available.No bathroom. Small shop.Bon appetit!"
1779,RmQOUUkwHDhuuh9Y6XzLsQ,2/1/2023,1 star rating,"I agree with the other reviews about the small portions and also the lack of flavor in the dishes. The fact that they cut up the chicken into tiny pieces so it blends in with the tofu so you aren't really getting much of the protein you are paying for, it's mostly just sauce and noodles. I would recommend Boon Thai for cheaper and larger portions of food with great flavor. I can only recommend this place step it up in the taste and quantity area or they might have to close shop."
1780,RmQOUUkwHDhuuh9Y6XzLsQ,5/11/2022,3 star rating,"The food here is underwhelming. Spicy CK tasted like freezer chicken nuggets. Portion was decent but at $15 not sure it's worth it. Queens curry had a strange after taste. I opted to eating the vegetable and chicken only, so I removed them from the curry - the chicken pieces were tiny and kind of sad. Vegetables were mostly from a can. It did have Thai eggplant which was nice though. Daikon small soup was tasty but rather tiny. I used to come here a lot when I worked in the area. Sad the quality of food hasn't sustained."
1781,RmQOUUkwHDhuuh9Y6XzLsQ,1/8/2023,2 star rating,"This place was beyond confusing. The chicken ""satay"" was a bunch of pieces of chopped grilled chicken with no flavor whatsoever. The accompanying peanut sauce was liquidy with many peanut chunks floating inside. The pad thai itself was alright. It came with minimal chicken but was otherwise non-offensive. I would try somewhere else next time."
1782,RmQOUUkwHDhuuh9Y6XzLsQ,12/29/2021,2 star rating,"Would come here again for their entree such as noodles or rice. But as far as the wings? For the almost $10, to get 5 (small) wings, thats a no. It is really crispy, I would give it that. But as for the chicken itself, it was overly salty. (Almost still taste the frozenness of chicken) The sauce I got Khao Man Gai, it was gingery and refreshing, helping with the salty wings."

Not ordering from here again.
1784,RmQOUUkwHDhuuh9Y6XzLsQ,3/12/2022,5 star rating,"A great take on thai food. I love the drunk & hungry noodles, which is ramen style stir fried noodles with the flavor profile of drunken noodles. My fav though is the bohdi noodles. They are also a stir fried ramen noodle, but made in a hit of coconut milk so they are slightly sweet and creamy, without being saucy. I highly recommend with some crispy chicken atop it. Their spring rolls are really good as well, mainly due to their thick, sweet, yet slightly acidic, pomegranate dipping sauce for them. I have eaten from here several times and will continue to do so!"

Which is like, you have all the access to food you could ever want but you can't eat whatever you want. (I'm rolling my eyes at me too.) Cut to the chase: gluten interacts with a much needed med and if I eat it I get a migraine that no pain reliever will temper. I have to wait till it's out of my system, which is a really long time. So I call to make orders now, to ensure there's no gluten. You think you know where this is going but surprise! It's about bean sprouts. I asked for no bean sprouts as i have a reaction to those too. But like, good riddance. Anyway, called, confirmed no gluten, asked for no bean sprouts *twice*MF'n bean sprouts. Then I'm thinking if they can't get that right, how do I know they got the gluten-free part right? So I call to say, hey I got bean sprouts, can't eat the food, please refund. And the woman is like, I have no record of your call. I give her my name, address, mention I asked about gluten-free, and blessed be the iphone, told her the time of my call- which lasted a whole 9 min. Sorry, no record of your call or order. At this point I'm certain I'm being f'd with. Zero stars and a middle finger for service."

The croissant was so well made. That stood out for me. But otherwise, it was a kind of ""I could make this at home"" type. We came in on marathon sunday so it did get packed at one point around 11:30 but it came in waves. They have a good amount of indoor and outdoor seating which is always good. I would've tried other sweets if I wasn't on a budget. I'd recommend if you wanna splurge on breakfast!"

Because it is a hot humid day decided to get the rosewater lemonade also great and refreshing.Probably the best vegan croissant I've ever had. The place was empty at 12 on a Friday and the staff was super helpful and nice I would highly recommend for any vegans or non-vegans who want delicious food!

Will definitely be back to try more sandwiches and pastries! **cons: ordered via yelp and added extras which I was charged for but they weren't on the sandwich.

1804,Xn_UheApVz6K9heX4vY8PA,11/8/2021,5 star rating,"Best and most innovative vegan croissants (and croissants in general). Special homage to the weekend specials that change every week! I hold all croissants to this standard which sucks for other places because most croissants can't compare. Quality, flaky layers, cooked with enough butter to be moist and flaky, but not dry. And always fun fresh flavors to fit the season and mood. One thing is that there is a struggle with consistency. On occasion I'll come and the batch is slightly burnt/over baked which is bit of a letdown if I happen to bring friends on that day to try their infamous croissants. I always recommend going on weekends around 11am to try the specials. They are supposed to come out at 10am but I've come many times in the early morning and they're usually late, so 11am is a safe bet. Main reason to come on weekend is to try their weekend specials, and because even if you're not feeling the weekend special, you can always get the savory or sweet Danish, the Almond croissant or a plain croissant. But hey, then you've got options and a great line of backups!I'm probably one of the few people that don't care for the breakfast Bombs because it's just a bit dense for me. The cinnamon rolls look intimidating but are totally worth trying because instead of the bready rolls, they're like flaky croissants wrapped into a cinnamon bun. So it's light and flaky inside, and loaded with a lot of flavor. The plain one is def really really sweet with the icing, as are most cinnamon rolls. But the croissant texture inside is totally worth it. And again, I would recommend picking a weekend to try the special version so you've got something special in the filling to offset the icing.I got the s'more cinnamon roll and was kinda scared because I don't typically like s'mores. But I was there and decided to try it and wasn't disappointed. On the contrary I was pleasantly surprised with the flaky layers and the surprise fillings inside. Along with the cinnamon filling in each layer there was chocolate and marshmallows and just a lot of flavor. Sweet, yes. So I'd pick my chances when to try it and also share with a friend. But the croissants here are pretty high quality and worth trying. The savory Danish always has a really nice delicate crisp to it. If you're not into sweets, this is a great one to try.

As the name suggests, you have your fair share of beers here, but the most I can do is hard cider so I really can't comment on the beers. However, I will say the bartender is on point. I ordered one of my favorite drinks - a lemon drop and it did not disappoint. It was literally perfect. So much so that I ordered a second one ( which to be honest I didn't need because I was feeling nice). For food, I got the fish tacos which comes with tortilla chips that I was able to swap out for the truffle parm tots. The tots were good, but didn't necessarily scream of truffle flavor. As far as the fish tacos, for me personally they had too much going on. I like a simple fried fish with a slaw and a nice sauce to pull it together. Nonetheless, the fish was fried and seasoned well. I ended up eating the fish out of the taco.As far as service, I had a great experience. For our server, we had Milly, who definitely passed to vibe check. She was extremely helpful and observant and great to chat with. If you stop by make sure you ask for her.Would I go back? Yes, definitely. As a brunch girl, I definitely want to check out what their brunch has to offer!"

It was okay.  I'm compelled to write a review because the wings are NOT great.  I went for the wings because so many reviews rave.  The sauces are tasty, but the wings, single or double cooked were both soggy skinned. Yuck.  I dont understand who's writing these reviews about fabulous wings?  Theyve certainly never had a good plate of buffalo wings. We sat at the bar because the dining room doesnt have chairs, they have unpadded backless icy cold metal stools that felt like they were a weird height too, like they were a little short.  If there wasnt room at the bar, we might not have stayed. The bartender was a very nice guy, helpful, knowledgeable, made suggestions about beers and the menu when asked, but he wasnt very alert.  Even though it was 5pm on a Tuesday he seemed half asleep and it was tough to get his attention. Burgers were good, but again, just average.  The happy hour ""specials"" were nothing special.  I woulnt refuse to go back, but it wont ever be my my first choice."

So first I went with my sister and she has 6 children. I was unsure of how they would treat us because we had 6 children with us. But I must say the service was amazing. The manager sat us at a long table with low chairs for the children. Then she would check in on us regularly. They were very children friendly. The atmosphere was good and the tvs were showing the games. Now the food we ordered the boneless chicken wings with French fries. It was really good and I liked very much. The chicken was fresh and tasty. The children enjoyed it very much. Then I had the Philly cheesesteak and tater tots. The cheesesteak was huge and delicious. I only ate half and the tater tots were also very good. The food was not greasy and did not upset my stomach. I am always a bit worried with fried foods because sometimes they are greasy or not flavorful. This was not the case the food was very good and so was the service. I ordered a drink and it was ok. I would definitely be back.

For drinks I wanted a beer similar to a Stella & the waiter was kind enough to bring me two samples of something similar. I ended up with the #11. For our appetizer we decided to go with the Philly cheesesteak egg rolls. Those were delicious the accompanying sauce was also perfect, it was some sort of Mayo & ketchup. It brings 3 rolls cut in half, so definitely a good portion size. I really recommend & I will be back for those alone. After our appetizer I got the original burger no complaints there it was a good burger. I loved the pickles. My boyfriend got the wings of course, the Carolina bbq kind double fried. Those were amazing, the grill really takes them to a different level.Overall we had a great experience. The waiter we had seemed to be going through training and he was still on point. The service was really good. The prices were also very reasonable to give you an idea we spent about $60 including tip. Would definitely recommend if you're in the mood for some GOOD bar food."

I rarely make it a point to review fast food places like McDonalds, Dunkin, etc... because people usually know how they taste already. The reason why I went out of my way to review this location is because of the fantastic customer service!During COVID I ordered from this place a couple of times and each time the delivery man was super kind.

This chain offers bounteous opportunities for one to build his or her own sandwich--different breads, proteins (vegetarian options included), vegetables, cheeses, sauces, etc. allows one to customize his sandwich to his liking. The prices are pretty great in my opinion. You can get a decent footlong sandwich here for five dollars (plus tax) that will actually fill you up. There are different sandwich options at different prices--the highest you'll pay for a footlong here is $7.25, but that's still pretty good! This location is extremely small, though. I've been to a lot of small Subway restaurants, but this one takes the cake as the smallest restaurant of its chain. Sometimes the line can stretch to the door, making it almost impossible to enter or leave, or sit. There aren't a lot of seating at this restaurant, either. It's a more go-in-get-out type of establishment. The staff here is alright, often times rude...It is Subway, so you're not going to be getting serviced like you would at a five-star restaurant. Despite that notion, they could be a lot friendlier. All in all, if you're just looking to grab a sandwich at a great price, then this location is right for you. However, if you're looking to be treated with great service or looking for an establishment with enough seating, then this isn't the place for you. Anyhow, come try out their sandwiches if you're too lazy to make your own at home or are craving a warm, toasted sandwich.Now, I've got to get back to nom-ing down my sandwich. Happy Subwaying!"

Honestly, I would give 0 stars for a particular reason.  My reason is for an employee there, that is unfortunately a mainstay and seems to be working there often.  The other employees I have come in contact with, are professional and actually are easy to communicate with AND GET MY ORDER THE WAY I WANT IT!-that is why I regret giving this one star, but I had an incident yesterday from this certain employee. I read ""Jessica S."" review and she has dealt with the same employee that I have.  Eight times I have had my order screwed from this worker.  I specifically one time, informed him I wanted MUSTARD and NOT Mayonnaise on my sandwich and what does he do?-he puts Mayonnaise. When I asked him if he could could take the Mayo off, he refused.  Also another time, this same person CHARGED ME for 4 cookies which is what I asked for, but he only PLACED THREE. The reason I did not catch it, because I was on a job call(though I should have payed attention) This person usually messes up orders most of the time that I visit.  I once blew up at him, because he did not PAY ATTENTION in what I was telling him what I wanted for my order. He is not good and needs to be replaced. I guess now if I want a sandwich, I might as well go to the supermarket and get the meats to make one myself. Very frustrating."

You can't make it through a sporting event without regurgitating in your mouth at least five times at the sight of a Frito-topped cheese enchilada sandwich.

I've heard Kabu mentioned by relatives countless times (due in part to it being the plug for salteñas--which I will get to momentarily), thus I was looking forward to my first time there. First and definitely my last. Be particularly weary of one bartender ""Cary,"" whom spoiled me and my girlfriend's experience there from the very beginning. After being ignored multiple times to order some drinks (the bar was not at all busy, especially given the fact that it was a Sunday afternoon), she proceeded to give me and my girlfriend the snarliest attitude, that we have encountered in all of my time of going to bars in the greater NYC area, after I attempted to correct a discrepancy in prices for a beer ($5 on the menu, I paid $12 for two). Now, granted it's only a 2 dollar difference, which I don't mind at all. But, as a graduate working in the service industry (Panera, Walgreeens, etc), I just couldn't find a reason for her to justify her demeanor after I politely pointed out the differences in price. First impressions are lasting impressions, so thank you ""Cary"" for leaving one on me of your employer. All in all, the beers were cold, salteñas took over an hour to prepare (which I slightly empathize over as Bolivians love their salteñas on Sundays, yet I can't disregard how puny in size they are) and could be considered average at best. The venue itself is appealing and spacious enough, but with poor air circulation, and with the waitresses holding their own. Buyer beware; Kabu is one spot I won't find myself at again."

Service was great, and they actually gave us extra blueberry jam(?) and bread when we ran out while having our appetizer.The pastas were okay; they used a lot of pepper in both.. My friend and I felt like it mostly tasted like pepper than the other sauces/seasoning they used ): Pretty affordable for New York and would be good for a last minute, casual meal with friends!"
1849,hyBM_Xk9Hzp38acTHAHlBQ,5/7/2022,4 star rating,"We were finishing up a visit to the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum and wanted to eat a bit before boarding our evening cruise. Gotham West Market seemed the perfect place. We were a bit disappointed that not every vendor was open but I imagine it could be a lively food hall sometimes.Dell'anima was a winner for us. Everything was very good. We devoured the octopus and almost went back to order another. We also ordered a bone marrow, bucatini alla arrabbiata, tagliatelle alla bolognese, and tajarin alla carbonara. Of the three, the bolognese was the favorite. The bone marrow was a tad too salty and not one of the best we've had, but it was not bad either.I did not expect to find restaurant-vibe/quality options in a dining hall so was pleasantly surprised by dell'anima. However, if you aren't already in Hell's Kitchen, I wouldn't come by just for it."

The pasta was also ok. I like the noodle itself, but the sauce was kinda lacking in flavor. The carbonara with ramp was slightly strange and I'm not sure about that raw yolk on top of the carbonara. It supposed to be good but since the sauce is weak I think adding the yolk dilute the sauce even more. The Bolognese was just ok.3 stars - not bad."

Superb on all levels: the wines by the glass, the three apps we had - burrata, ricotta crostini with pine nuts, and a haunch of bone marrow so substantial, rich and delicious it could feed me for a week - plus the orrechiete with wild boar and risotto with spicy sopressata. Capped by a textbook perfect tiramisu. The small staff couldn't have been friendlier, and miracle of miracles the joint is not DEAFENING. The walk from the theatre district pre-show is well worth it, as the quality is miles above more conveniently located restaurants. This is now hands down my go to pre or post eaterie."

Service was prompt and friendly, it was definitely a popular spot but there were still a few empty tables despite it being a Friday evening.We got the Santa Fe burger and the Buffalo chicken wrap, both of which were delicious. Appreciated that the wrap was not drowned in Buffalo sauce like many other places. The burgers come with panini-pressed buns which is a unique touch. The wrap is a pretty good deal at $16, whereas the burgers start at $18 but if you want cheese and other additions it can go up to $24. Their cocktails were also good and reasonably priced for the area. I enjoyed the old fashioned made although it was quite a small glass."

Subway's lack of care or professionalism has lost a customer for LIFE.  Needless to say I deleted the app and my credit card information.  Subway should consider two-factor authorization to prevent future fraud.Thanks for nothing, Mr. Mohammed Alam!Mr. Alam's heartless email message is below:Dear Michael Clarke,I want to take a moment to thank you for contacting me and sharing your feedback regarding your recent Subway® experience.At Subway, we often promote different products in new, creative ways in order to keep things fresh and appeal across the broad spectrum of our loyal customers.

Second, one of the best focaccia breads I've ever had. I don't know if it was the olive oil they used, the airiness of the slice I had, the perfect amount of sea salt or all of the above but I will dream of this focaccia for nights to come.You can see the workings of all the baked goods right behind the counter. The wall paper is just so cheery and there are several areas where you can sit and dine whether it be one of their baked goods or one of their Neapolitan pizzas. The second you walk in it just smells like a perfect combo of pizza and desserts. I ordered a mint tea and a delicious double chocolate chip. You can tell this was a fav in the neighborhood as people came in to meet up for a quick cup of coffee and a chance to catch up. Before leaving I purchased the following: fruit and nut baguette (the baby has already ate half the loaf...) an everything baguette (delish just sliced but can't wait to make avocado toast with it) and my slice of focaccia. So do yourself a favor and pop in here and try one of everything."

The kitchen is open and right behind the counter so you can see them rolling and shaping the dough. I had a few of the pastries and they were ok. None of them stood out to me, but would still recommend to someone if they were nearby and in a pinch. Basically just an average bakery but has the necessities for a neighborhood staple"
1869,qpj8kc8y3SgLA6GWkVgX3g,6/9/2022,4 star rating,"Some really great fresh bread and baked goods can indeed be found at the cusp of Two Bridges/LES in Partybus Bakeshop. I love coming for their miche, which is available in quarter, half, and whole portions ($5-18) and sliced upon request as well, as well as their sticky buns ($5) which are full of cinnamon flavor and so fluffy. I'd also highly recommend the Scallion Buns ($2) which are simply incredible (hearty, fluffy, and perfumed with a deliciously savory and herbaceous scallion oil), and a beautiful nod to the neighborhood the bakery is situated in. In fact, 10% of all proceeds from the scallion buns are donated to Heart of Dinner, which provides hot lunches and pantry essentials to the homebound, elderly, and vulnerable population in Chinatown."

It's got strong and rich scallion flavor which I love. The croissant is on the doughy side (not the flakey type) but moist and not greasy or sweet. I like that they don't sweeten it or put a sugar coating on top like many croissant places do in NYC which is just not French croissant! The sandwich was good with the ingredients just for me the baguette could be more crispy and fresh. Definitely wanna come back to try other bread and the peso sandwich."

Finally stopped in and got the Frenchie (Black Forest ham, fontina, salted butter on a baguette) and an iced coffee. Oh my goodness, the baguette is possibly one of the best baguettes I've ever had! It has a really crunchy crust, nicely-formed air pockets, and good chew. The fillings of ham, fontina, and butter are simple but worked harmoniously. Portion wise it's pretty good too, can easily split it into two meals if you pair it with a soup or salad.Awesome spot, can't wait to come back to try more goodies!"

This is coming from someone who doesn't care for cinnamon rolls/buns/whatnot but I fell in love with this upon the first bite. $4 for one piece, for $20 for the whole tray (6 buns?) Ummm you're gonna need to buy the whole tray. I made the mistake of only ordering two, and it was just gone in a minute.The bread is superrr fluffy, but my favorite has to be their cream cheese frosting. I could probably eat a pint of this frosting by itself. Not sickeningly sweet. Still sweet, but balanced enough. Just get ittttMushrom Dijon Danish $4.50: while I really enjoyed the mushroom and dijon combination (surprisingly very good) I wished there was more of it since it was centered and didn't come with every nibble unless your bite is half a danish in one go. Not extra flakey either, but decently crispy enough.Ricotta Cheesecake ($5/slice): these cake slices are super tiny for the price point. I love the extra buttery crust, and while the filling is decent, it's not very strong in the flavorStrawberry Rhubarb Pie ($5/slice): should probably preface this by saying I normally hate pie...and I definitely didn't enjoy this. The pie crust is good, but the cooked fruits component has such a pungent vinegar-y taste that just left me rinsing my mouth afterwards. Also, this doesn't travel well - everything fell apart and was a messPeach Pie: if you must try a pie, go for this one, muchh better"
1874,qpj8kc8y3SgLA6GWkVgX3g,10/16/2021,5 star rating,Wow i stopped by on a whim after seeing the rose pistachio croissant on their google maps profile and it did not disappoint! I didn't expect the rose pistachio croissant to have any filling but it did and added a great contained moisture to the otherwise dry croissant. The filling was a bit on the sweet side and can easily start dripping out near the end.I ended up also getting the mushroom danish and turmeric cookie because they caught my eye.. the danish was delightful! Wish it was warmed up a bit but there was some hint of horseradish that made it unique; was not too salty. Would pass on the turmeric cookies next time - exactly what you'd imagine and on the tough (as opposed to soft) cookie side.

Spin the giant wheel to win prizes, or sit in the fake electric chair in the back for some cool pics.

Maybe there would be more women clientele.When you come here pay to spin the wheel. It's a total must at Duff's! You win fun stuff or more drinks!I love coming here with groups for a couple quick ones. And then back to a show or event. Perfect for all the photo ops! From the creepy stuffed man on the bench and the Iron Maiden Eddie rug. This place is a total blast. I also love that there is so much decor that sometimes I spot something new, like the Type-O-Negative neon light. As a heads up, this doorway is hidden if you don't know where you are going.

Mind you this is my 5th time coming and this new server, Karina, who I've never seen in my life, claims there's a $15 per person drink minimum. When I asked her since when, she gave me a bullshit excuse with a nasty condescending tone. Second, we ordered a regular $35 hookah. These dumbasses charged us an extra $5 for a fresh fruit head. When I told the manager, he's like ""y'all are already smoking it.."" LMFAOOOOO. Enough said. Also, we were only there for 30 minutes. $40 for a 30 minute hookah???Lastly, we kept asking for a tiny cake to be brought out for my friend as it was her birthday. These fuckers took a day and a half to bring it out, just as we were packing up to leave. So long story short: nasty server, crappy manager, and the most disorganized place. Shame as I loved coming here but I will be going to another hookah lounge in the city, somewhere they don't charge you on the sly."

The white mushroom flatbread is pretty good. Fries kinda suck, not too crispy. The fried pita is not bad. Service is super slow, took them 30m at least for a side of pita, and 15m to refill water."

Every 5 mins she would bother us to order more even though we as 4 people ordered 4 hookahs, 4 plates of food and 4 cocktails. Then an hour later she brought the check saying that our time is up. I understand that you want make more % from tips but that's not how you treat your customers. Plus, what the heck is the time limit when we are ordering well enough! We wanted to order second round of hookah and drinks but still got denied. Never coming back!!!"

They have a great swanky ambiance but pricing has gotten sketchy and waitresses do not transparently communicate it to customers. For example, they now charge the full price of a new hookah to simply change the shisha.  This was not communicated ahead of time nor is it correctly listed on the menu. Super disappointing. Don't forget that they also tack on a mandatory 20% tip."

Until I came to While In Kathmandu of course. My typical experience with them is an overly doughed ratio that overtakes the filling, that are usually served steamed instead of fried.My coworker who lives around the corner absolutely loves this place. And despite my apprehensions, ordered all of their momos... except the fried. And I'm glad he did, cause these were the best momos I've ever had. The wrappers thin and wrapped tightly and they carry this beautiful gloss to them. They look like the models of the dumpling world. They're served swimming in an orange curry that doesn't overpower the meat.We also went with the naan and dry wings that are a great option. I was a little worried cause my other coworker previously ordered them and said his butthole looked like an elementary school science project after (vinegar and baking soda). They weren't spicy at all and that's how I found out that my coworker is just a little bih."

We were seated right away. One thing to note is they only take cash. I ordered the chicken cholla which actually filled me up. It was really flavorful. Very good. We got the Alfredo dish to share. I only ate a small portion. We got chicken with it but it came on the side not in the Alfredo. We ended up packing it up to go because we weee full from the appetizers.

We were curious about trying this place out as it seemed like it was a new place that had some westernized/hipsterfied versions of Nepalese dishes. We shared an order of their kathmandu poppers, which were fried peppers stuffed with cream cheese (basically, like jalapeno poppers but in a different type of pepper and with a South Asian twist) and I got an order of their veggie chole momos and a mango lassi, while the SO got their goat chirwan ko tass thali set.We liked everything we got, and we were pretty intrigued by the puffed rice that came with the thali set. I liked my momos and the fried peppers were tasty as well. It wasn't exactly cheap, but this place is rather unique, so a nice place you could go to for date night, or if you're curious about what westernized Nepalese food can be like."

Something bright would be nice on this, like some fresh parsley or cucumber. I think I need to try it in house again. Cheese naan: As expected. Tasty! The tomato dipping sauce grew on me as I ate it. The portion of bread was more than I expected, which was nice. Pork Mimi's: The star! So so tasty. As soon as I opened the container and got a whiff of the sauce, I knew it would hit. I want more of these! And definitely want to try the other fillings , especially shrimp. Masala wings: So I ordered because of these, but his was my least favorite part of the meal. They didn't deliver well, which I had a feeling would happen (sauced wings can't really stay crispy with waterier sauces-- in this case a tomato based sauce). The first bite was fireyyy. Ten minutes later my lips are still tingling. I personally don't enjoy this level of heat, but see how others would. Spiciness aside, the flavors were there without a doubt.

We were the first people to arrive one Friday at noon and had the option to sit wherever we wanted. The host was incredibly hospitable and suggested a few items he think we would enjoy. For apps settled for the chicken dumplings which was simmered in a flavorful broth that tasted like coconut curry and crispy whiting followed by a trout with quinoa and lamb for the entre. The food was delicious. We also had the Nepalese iced tea and preseco.*Note: they are a CASH ONLY establishment. Also, the iced tea has cardamom (Google what that might do to your tummy).Enjoy!!!"

Great happy hour that goes until 7pm and includes wines by the glass ($10), bottles ($36), and some beer. The cheese and meats were nice, as were the olives and almonds. The inside has a U-shaped bar so it has a communal vibe. Lots of outdoor, covered seating, some with heaters as well. Our waitress was very attentive even with all the chaos of Halloween going on (great spot for people watching on the way to the parade) and they were giving out candy to the kids. Would definitely come here again for happy hour. Probably not the best place to have a full on meal, but come for some good wine and then go have dinner somewhere else nearby."

It's one of those places that's always the right amount of busy - they'll be able to seat you, but it's never dead. They have a nice amount of outdoor seating and the service is always decent.One complaint is that they do offer food but it is very very limited so it's not the sort of place where you can really feasibly do dinner. They have sandwiches on the menu but I think they may only be offered for lunch. It's more of a like a wine and charcuterie type place. The charcuterie boards are great though!They don't change the menu frequently which I actually prefer because I'm a bit picky with wine so when I find one I like I rarely deviate. They have a few orange wines too which is not my style, but I have some friends really into the whole bio/natural thing.Would return."

Great wine list delish bar snacks, Corin (not sure of the correct spelling of her name) and Tai were steaming the vibe in the air. Wagyu Sliders is a must try in addition the charcuterie that enhanced the richness of a bottle of burgundy even further. Tips: they will open wines that are only by bottles as long as you can consume two glasses. How superb."

1927,fVJUSwTsWqFnarBHCy5Ydw,5/3/2022,5 star rating,"TLDR: If you're craving Greek and you want them meat sweats.. Kalamaki GR got you covered. Mixed Grill. Get that and get a salad because you need them greens. This place is damn delicious.I probably discovered this place how many have, I wanted Greek-ish meats but didn't feel like going out for it. Kalamaki GR popped up on my feed and I gave it a try.The Mixed Grill for 2 can easily be shared between 4 people, maybe even 5 or 6 if you have some smaller eaters. I will say - a single side for this order seems disproportionately small but there is nothing but value. You get bifteki (mini burgers), kalamaki (skewers), gyro, more gyro, a roast chicken (only thing I don't love), a crap ton of pita bread and a big tzatziki sauce.I think fries go best with this. I always opt to add a salad because you need that freshness to get through this party platter of Greek festivities.I probably should try some other stuff on the menu but the mixed grill just checks all the boxes."

I also just had one of their rasberry filled powder sugar doughnuts and OH DAMN this was seriously good and only for 1.25!My only complaint is that they dont have bottles of milk to buy (have vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry milk).

I love that about them. The breakfast food is decent. I haven't had lunch there but it seems the prices are the only downside of this place. You truly are paying for convenience.

I inquired concerning the missing date on the ""cold Pasta Salad"". I wanted to know when it was made - yesterday, today or later. The Spanish young lady said she did not know when it was made or why there was no date on the pasta salad. I ask for the owner or whoever was in charge and again this same young lady said that person was not at the site and could not be reached. I ask for the item to be placed in a plastic bag but instead this same young lady took the plastic bag and through it on the counter saying she couldn't take her glove off to put the item in the bag. In addition she did not give any napkins or any eating utensils. She became rude, vociferous and refused to place what I just paid for in any bag saying it was not her job. This type of disregard for customer service is not good for any establishment.  I have always pick up a salad from this place during the week or two and have always seen the date on all the salad of this establishment , this gives confidence that the item is fresh and when it is not it can be pulled off the shelf. I got nowhere with all three, they had no information as to where their boss was nor the phone number to call and speak to the manager.

They have a large selection of beers, even some hard to find ones, but beware because some of the less common ones may have expiration dates far in the past. In sum, great place, happy to have it in the neighborhood!"
1948,Py2_8uFX5UHLphwdEEop9A,6/11/2020,5 star rating,"Came here the other day, during covid-19 they are serving drinks outside the window . Wasn't sure what to expect, but there's always a crowd near by, people taking pics etc. so I decided to grab a passion fruit margarita. $8 for a decent size cup, and holy cow it was a very strong drink.Will stop by sometime later with friends!"
1949,Py2_8uFX5UHLphwdEEop9A,8/10/2021,5 star rating,"Loved the old-time feel the moment we walked in, and the AC wasn't bad either! Great bar counter, lots of local beers - one from two blocks away! Friendly staff, quick service and our Sunnyside favorite spot!!"
1950,Py2_8uFX5UHLphwdEEop9A,1/1/2019,4 star rating,A Sunnyside staple so close to the 40th Lowery Subway stop.  Always has a great mixed crowd and definitely have their regulars. They don't offer food but you can bring food in to nosh on.  Definitely a great after work place to unwind.  Let me rephrase that anywhere that has alcohol is a great place to unwind but it's the crowd that makes it much more interesting and fun.
1951,Py2_8uFX5UHLphwdEEop9A,9/25/2021,4 star rating,Solid local dive bar - good beers on tap and several tvs for football.  Friendly staff and a nice place to hang out on the weekend off the beaten path.
1952,Py2_8uFX5UHLphwdEEop9A,2/15/2021,1 star rating,"I don't even know where to start on much this place has let me down.I have been living in this area for 6 years and everytime I walk in front of this place, I get cat called or approached by its clients and staff. There have been many times that a drunk client (/group of clients) has tried to touch me or block my way while walking on the street. The staff doesn't hold back either with their staring or catcalling. The worst part is when I walk with my roommate' daughter (who is CLEARLY a teenager and a MINOR) and she gets stared at and catcalled by middle aged men.  Of course you cannot control your clients or their actions, but this just tells you about what kind of people come to and work at this place. Sunnyside is a safe area and I never get treated like that in other parts of the neighborhood. Despite the catcalling, I tried to give this place a try because I thought the place could be better than its clients. I was wrong (I mean what was I expecting lol). I came here with a friend some time ago and the alcohol that was served made us throw up all night (it tasted funny too). Not sure what we were served but it was definitely not good.We gave it another shot a few months later. Me and my friends were all clearly over the age of 21, but upon showing our IDs we were told that  only New York State IDs are accepted ?? What kind of a place only accepts customers who have a NY ID?? When we asked to speak to a manager, people of my friend group were then called racial and and homophobic slurs. So, to recap the experience: alcohol that makes you throw up, racial/homophobic slurs + catcalling and harassment by the staff and clients and you cannot purchase anything without a NY state ID. What more do you want?"
1953,Py2_8uFX5UHLphwdEEop9A,6/11/2017,3 star rating,"It's a standard bar on Queens Boulevard. On the plus side, they have a pretty decent beer list. On the con side, they don't serve food. Another pro? They have Happy Hour all week. You can get a decent mixed drink for $5. Not bad. Just don't expect too many beer offerings on the Happy Hour menu. The bartender we had on this particular day (Saturday) was alright. She was fairly attentive, but not too keen on talking to or fraternizing with the patrons. That's fine by me. I was there to watch sports anyway!"

However, from the moment I walked into Courtyard my weariness was no where to be found! Start to finish this place is outstanding. Beer Selection- On fleek! There's a beer for everyone! Service- Outstanding. All barkeeps are Irish (and I become a little Irish after my staple shot of Jameo and an IPA)  Reason for no fifth star: Need food! You're allowed to bring some in, but I'd like to see some Irish flare brought to the table (ha. ha. ha)"

Awesome place & it's one of the most popular pubs in Sunnyside! They have fun organized nights karaoke , games etc. If you are hungry there is taco truck parked in front of the pub you can get food!"

Over 2 hrs for a pizza to be delivered 10 minutes from the place! Ridiculous!!! They gave us 10% off the next order as compensation!! Laughable!"

I tell the girl can you not give me 98 cents in change she said but that's the price I said ok take two Pennie's from the tip jar she said but it's the tips. I said ok I'll get two Pennie's from my car. I take my order and put it in my car and return with two Pennie's. She says u didn't have to bring the two Pennie's back, I said well why didn't u say that. To top it off I get home after A 10 min drive and the pizza is a complete different order I say please deliver the correct order, i give her my address and she hangs up the phone. So many other pizzas I can order from, I'll lay off from this place for a while"

Sadly, I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong it was good but wasn't memorable and could've used more cheese. The picture was taken after I added Parmesan cheese."
1960,5kHNyJABl521cgtAzj9_dw,10/12/2022,2 star rating,I ordered to go two entrees. Veal Parm and Chicken Marsala. Breaded veal was not fresh at all. Probably kept in the  freezer for long time. Chicken Marsala was ok but no taste. Bread served with it really old. I could smell that. I never had old bread from any pizzeria.
1961,5kHNyJABl521cgtAzj9_dw,11/11/2022,5 star rating,Food is delicious and great portions. They updated the restaurant and it looks so beautiful inside. Definitely recommend
1962,5kHNyJABl521cgtAzj9_dw,2/18/2022,4 star rating,This was the first time ordering from this restaurant me and my girlfriend enjoyed the eggplant parmigiana it was fresh (not mushy) it was cooked just perfect and the sauce was on point! The only issue we didn't like was the calimari consistence was fried hard and rubbery and it was a shame we had to toss it! I definitely would give it another try the sauce was almost like my own !They arrived sooner then they said and most of all they were extremely polite!
1963,5kHNyJABl521cgtAzj9_dw,11/30/2022,2 star rating,They suck. Always take an hour and a half PLUS to deliver. Really should not take that long considering the quality of their food is ok at best.

Old World Pizza: Wow, it was so good. You could definitely taste the fresh mozzarella that was paired with the delicious tomato sauce. Definitely worth it. Overall, I will come back for more. I recommend this to my family and friends who want to try out some good pizza."

1967,pymPEcd_X1A1pvXHQeg0_w,5/1/2022,4 star rating,"This Wendy's outpost has been here for as long as i can remember. I stopped in recently to pick up some lunch for me, & a family member. Utilizing the app made the cost very reasonable. Everything tasted as expected. I think the burger surpasses McDonald's & Burger King in terms of taste, & freshness. The cashier may had been a little new, but made up for it with the friendly service. This time was a takeout order, but they have a sizable dining area upstairs. Indoor dining is quiet on weekends; & more rowdy on weekdays (as school kids spend time there). There are a couple of TVs around the space, along w/ an artificial fireplace. You can also sit by the window to people watch from above."
1968,pymPEcd_X1A1pvXHQeg0_w,6/9/2022,5 star rating,If your hungry and are looking for something sweet or even coffee I recommend coming here. Oh I was yearning for something sweet with caffeine and I found that Wendy's now have a iced coffee with frosty in it. It was more coffee and iced in frosty but I didn't taste frosty for a moment. So I got two and one and the price is decent for large one. I strongly recommend it
1969,pymPEcd_X1A1pvXHQeg0_w,2/5/2023,1 star rating,ordered a chicken sandwich and it was completely raw. tried calling restaurant 3 times and no answer. completely unprofessional and now i'm scared for my health. it is absolutely unacceptable to serve raw chicken. disgusting... couldn't eat the rest of my food and had to throw the rest out.
1970,pymPEcd_X1A1pvXHQeg0_w,9/24/2022,1 star rating,"Workers in here always have an attitude and always forgetting items. It's bad enough that they forget things when you walk in for the order but when you do an ubereats order, they're always forgetting things or always putting in wrong items."
1971,pymPEcd_X1A1pvXHQeg0_w,7/9/2022,1 star rating,"The service here is very poor. I downloaded the app to get the free ten piece chicken nugget offer it gives. When I got inside the person at the register scanned the offer but didn't know how to apply it to my order. When another worker came to help they had to re-scan for the offer again. Because of this I was told that the offer was ineligible because they scanned the app twice. So I never got my free offer and didn't get anything except a ""it says it doesn't work anymore"". The customer service was terrible and the lack of knowledge the workers had of their own register shows how this establishment is truly run. Not to mention the cleanliness of the place was horrible. I will not be bringing my business here again and suggest others don't either"
1972,pymPEcd_X1A1pvXHQeg0_w,2/10/2021,5 star rating,"I will say that I have never had a problem with the service or the food at this location. I usually like to go here for the baked potatoes, it is my favorite menu item. I also appreciate that this location is larger than it looks from the outside, as there is a downstairs level (although it is closed until further notice due to the pandemic)."
1973,pymPEcd_X1A1pvXHQeg0_w,3/24/2022,2 star rating,"I've come here multiple times on the morning commute when I take the train. It's always slow in the morning even when I pay on the kiosk (which I think is slower to get a soda than going to this location as you end up waiting for the food orders).  Oddly the Newark NJ locations give free refills and are more reliable this Wendy's.  To catalyze my irritation today after paying almost $4 for $1 worth of soda and plastic cup, I walked out with a completely flat soda and no more time left to ask someone to refill the CO2. So obviously nobody checks the soda machine before the store opens. I like that Wendy's has good solid cube ice but I think I'm going to have to switch to Chic-fil-a on Fulton and deal with the crushed ice and hope for more reliable morning service there."

But the current $5 Biggie Bag is the deal of the century. We're about about Midwest prices in freaking Financial District Manhattan.

The crust on the main pies are extremely thin making reheating a slice for crust lovers a terrible experience, not to mention most spots are pretty singed/burned already from the 'wood fire'2. The price point on these pies are a bit ridiculous. I have only tried the white pie, which comes w seasoned ricotta and caramelized onions w sesame seeds. I think the combo makes for an interesting one; however, I will say that after ordering at least 3 times, the sesame seeds creep down taking up almost a third of the slice leaving you with like 2/3 of the slice covered in toppings. I also wanted to add mushrooms ($5.50) and sausage ($7.50) to the pizza for a little razzle dazzle and I ended up spending $46.80 via UE. That is f**kin insane at almost $50.I also got a romaine salad and it was less than stellar and pretty sloppy overall. Lettuce looked kicked and wilted and shouldn't have been used to make the salad. The salad is super simple tbh and shouldn't cost $12 because it includes a few olives, 2 blistered tomatoes, red onion and a banana pepper. The first time I ordered, the meatball sub was missing. The restaurant said they included and tried to pin it on the UE driver, but I actually think that they forgot and did not take accountably. I def believed the UE driver. I ordered it again on a separate occasion and it was trash and overpriced @ $16.80. Minuscule spaghetti balls in a lackluster roll. The upcharge was most likely from the 'Pat LaFrieda' beef that it apparently includes, which honestly the quality didn't necessarily shine through. Tasted like conventional super market ground beef to me. Perhaps it wasn't seasoned particularly well? Idk, but I tossed it after 2 bites.

The crust on the main pies are extremely thin making reheating a slice for crust lovers a terrible experience, not to mention most spots are pretty singed/burned already from the 'wood fire'2. The price point on these pies are a bit ridiculous. I have only tried the white pie, which comes w seasoned ricotta and caramelized onions w sesame seeds. I think the combo makes for an interesting one; however, I will say that after ordering at least 3 times, the sesame seeds creep down taking up almost a third of the slice leaving you with like 2/3 of the slice covered in toppings. I also wanted to add mushrooms ($5.50) and sausage ($7.50) to the pizza for a little razzle dazzle and I ended up spending $46.80 via UE. That is f**kin insane at almost $50.I also got a romaine salad and it was less than stellar and pretty sloppy overall. Lettuce looked kicked and wilted and shouldn't have been used to make the salad. The salad is super simple tbh and shouldn't cost $12 because it includes a few olives, 2 blistered tomatoes, red onion and a banana pepper. The first time I ordered, the meatball sub was missing. The restaurant said they included and tried to pin it on the UE driver, but I actually think that they forgot and did not take accountably. I def believed the UE driver. I ordered it again on a separate occasion and it was trash and overpriced @ $16.80. Minuscule spaghetti balls in a lackluster roll. The upcharge was most likely from the 'Pat LaFrieda' beef that it apparently includes, which honestly the quality didn't necessarily shine through. Tasted like conventional super market ground beef to me. Perhaps it wasn't seasoned particularly well? Idk, but I tossed it after 2 bites.

On more occasion, I have received completely different items than what was ordered, and the correction took longer than the original order.  Other times I can go through the line quickly and have a tasty lunch or dinner without a hitch. The food is still usually fresh and the staff is laid back so give it a try and cross your fingers for accuracy."

I was excited because the line was pretty short, so I figured we'd grab a quick bite to eat and then head to our show. Unfortunately, there was only one person working the line! So the line moved unbelievably slowly - the worker was trying his best but there's only so much one person can do. I understand that hiring is probably pretty challenging right now, but the end result was a really disappointing experience.After ordering, we decided to sit down and eat in the restaurant. The tables were kind of dirty (nothing horrendous, though) and the quality of the food wasn't great (my steak didn't look or taste fresh). I can't imagine coming back to this Chipotle."

This location had only 1 person working during lunch which was odd so it took a little longer. I got the bowl with steak and it was overcooked.

Surely that's a given for a tex-mex inspired restaurant?To anybody working at this location that's confused, please allow me to explain--a burrito is a tortilla filled with various toppings and wrapped neatly into a cylindrical shape. As the toppings within are layered, the consumer gets a bite of each topping every time.A burrito is NOT:-Loosely wrapped into a fat square, with an opening at the back.-Filled with approximately 4.5 metric tonnes of each selected filling.-Layered horizontally so each filling makes up a separate bite. Guacamole should not be located 5 inches away from the beans, for instance.I had to ask for a bowl and eat this disaster over it--which resulted in me eating a soggy plain tortilla with a complete burrito bowl on the side.Order the burrito bowl. Spare yourself."

This is a very good food not for rude service.This location is at Main St. in Queens,  we ordered 2 bowls, the lettuce falling off the bowl and was not even closed properly. The food counter is too messy, rice, lettuce, cheese are on the counter base... service crew did not clean after their mess. They leave it on the food counter and move on to the next costumer.I paid for my order and I think the cashier made a mistake and didn't tell me, another lady came (I guess supervisor), and charge me again, I told her that I already paid, she said NO with a tone. I don't want to double pay, BUT if she explained to me what happened I will understand. So, I told her am not gonna pay again, then she said rudely, then am not gonna give you your food!  WHAT?   Was the rudest thing I have ever encountered, no explanation at all.So I repay put my pin again. I told them that If I have double charged am coming back for refund.My thing is, it's all about costumer service. Rudeness is not acceptable. They need more training for costumer service or hire more polite crew.I didn't say am not gonna eat at Chipotle again, I still want to, but not coming back to this branch. Cleanliness and Politeness of the lady crew is zero. Doesn't know how to deal with costumer and crew members."

When I go to Mcds I don't expect to be wowed but I do expect:-order accuracy-to get what I paid for-employees that adhere to corporate standards for behaviorThis place failed at all three. I ordered a quater pounder meal and chicken strips with a sprite. There was no line. I somehow waited 20 minutes. After 10 minutes I noticed that people with numbers past me were being called. I asked ""can you check what's happening with my order? I've been waiting and am now being skipped"". The girl acted like I was bothering her. She turned around and mumbled something to someone else. No one spoke to me, so I asked again. Minutes pass. She ignored me. I ask her again. She looks confused. I then stood in front of her and asked for her manager. The manager comes. She's like I'm sorry we canceled your order by mistake. I'm like ok so how much longer before I get my food. She's like I'm waiting for fries. I said while we wait, let me share with you that your employees are extremely rude and when a customer engages the, they should give an answer or work on getting one. She apologized and said she would prep my order asap. Minutes pass. I see fries being served. They are not my fries. I start thinking I am on candid camera. A woman starts yelling all sorts of curse words because she wants a curse word and I am standing there thinking what did I order again? where am I?So I get the Quarter pounder and strips in a bag. No fries. No soda. I ask for my soda. I get my soda. I sit down. I realize I don't have fries. I return. I engage. I use full sentences. I do not curse. I sit. Hold my breathe and wait for the ""what would you do"" guy. He doesn't appear. I vow to never return to this location.I think the employees seriously need training on efficiency, and time management. There were 6 of them behind the counter yet multiple people were getting the wrong items, missing items, having to come in after waiting for a drive thru meal. It was a mess. They seem to expect people to curse and act crazy, maybe they enjoy it? and that is why they fail so epically?"

The mac and cheese slice seems to be the most popular of these, I haven't tried it personally but I've enjoyed the buffalo chicken and chicken bacon ranch slices the most of the exotic onesThere are also some doughier options such as a Sicilian or if you're feeling especially glutinous a stuffed slice (almost like a pizza pot pie). While these are still very tasty I think the thin crust options are the move here as the ingredients used besides the bread are so flavorful and in these thicker options it's easy to get lost in the bread"

You place your order inside & wait outside until it's ready. I paid $8 for both pepperoni & plain slices (which looked better out of the oven this photo is the pizza about an hour later).

The staff is always friendly, the espresso is always good, and their drip coffee is pretty solid. They brew Counter Culture beans and know what they are doing. On my most recent visit, I noticed they've put in some indoor seating to complement their four tables and two benches outside. This is the first time they've had indoor seating since the pandemic, and I didn't go here pre-COVID. They now have three tables inside. Still not a ton of space, and I don't know if they are eager to have folks sit there for long stretches, but it is good enough for sipping on a coffee."

2080,2JdCSsfcRQt0L_8DN3ttKA,4/16/2022,5 star rating,"Excellent coffee. They know how to make a latte (and a cappuccino, etc.), and they use Counter Culture beans which I think are among the best beans around. The CC beans in a well crafted drink make for an excellent drink.The pastries are pretty good, too.Currently, I assume due to Covid, they ask that only one party enter at a time and don't have indoor seating... It's a small shop, so I can understand that. They do have some outdoor seating, though, and the service is about as fast as you could ask for handcrafted espresso drinks, so while I'm not sure if it has crunch times where waits might take longer, a handful of groups can arrive all at once without anyone having to wait outside too long. A small latte and an apple pastry comes to $8 with tax, so while I can be one to whine about prices, theirs aren't unreasonable. All in all, a very good place for coffee."

I absolutely love them. They have a smaller menu which is for cheaper sushi, however the fish quality is extremely good, Ive ordered from here 15+ times and have only had one issue where the order didn't arrive.  Each roll comes in a box, and can be catered to your individual allergies (Dairy, Gluten, Wheat, Shelfish, etc...)I like their box witch comes with up to 4 different flavors (its 2 rolls you can request up to 4 flavors). The first Keto Sushi place thats not a naruto roll. The price is about 12-15 per roll). I love the salmon. My husband loved the salmon roll so much he ordered another because the fish was so fresh."
2087,SBQ0iuFG15rscuArUYDlTg,12/16/2022,4 star rating,"This is social media Sushi, at it's core. It's packaged well. It's easy & not complicated to eat, nothing is fishy. It's catered to the basic. Quality: 4Blue crab: 4Everything else: solidPortion to $: 2Packaging: platinum standardMy self anointed ""sushi expert"" coworker thinks it's overpriced for what it is. I somewhat agree, but I ask you again: have you seen the packaging? It's beautiful. Have you ever had the original cronut ? When you leave that spot, they package your one fuk'n pastry in a box that looks like a designer handbag. I'm not saying you should keep these types of boxes for moving out of your Covid priced apartment, I'm just saying they gave a lot of thought to its design and you need to pay respect. Look bro, when the boss is paying, this is the perfect work lunch order that won't give you the itus, so you can actually be somewhat productive after 1pm. If I had to pay for it- I'd pass because: 1) I typically skip lunch & 2) I'm trying to save my $ for my mangyna reduction, so I pack a lunch, if need be. Pro tip: you will be hungry again in about 2 hours post last piece. But- you knew that already."
2088,SBQ0iuFG15rscuArUYDlTg,12/7/2022,3 star rating,"Good food, great cocktails, rude service. I think the other reviews have covered how this place has an awesome balance of quality and value. The modern interior and minimalistic menu make this a great alternative to sushi that's too cheap in quality or too fancy/expensive. In particular we loved our cocktails. So delicious. Where this place loses stars is the service, specifically the waitress who was also the host. I came on 12/2 with my girlfriend.1) there was no one in the restaurant at 5:30, and I had reservations. I was immediately seated in the worst place in the whole restaurant, right by the bathrooms. I asked to be moved and the host moved me.  2) another two girls came in. The hostess seats them right next to us on an otherwise empty bar. There were dozens of other seats. 3) rudeness while ordering. Their happy hour menu has like 6 different handroll options. I order ""I want one of everything except spicy tuna."" And the waitress/host wouldn't accept that order. She kept insisting that I verbally list them. I pointed to the list on the menu and said ""I want each of these except spicy tuna."" And she wouldn't take my order until i stated it like ""i want lobster, yellowtail, etc"" this was just extremely off-putting. I go into the detail because it's the most tangible way to describe to someone who wasn't there what the tone of the interaction was for the entire meal. Thankfully she eventually switched out for another waitress who was lovely."

I was excited to try as I normally get their combo boxes but never had their hand rolls before. While I wouldn't say the anything ever ""wows"" me here, I think they consistently provide good quality sushi at pretty affordable prices.The hand rolls I tried were:- Yellowtail scallion- Spicy tuna- Hot and spicy scallop- Salmon ikura- Toro scallion- LobsterMy favorites were the scallop and yellowtail but all of them were good. Service was nice and super fast, we were in and out within 40 minutes. Come check them out for some affordable quality sushi!"
2091,SBQ0iuFG15rscuArUYDlTg,9/16/2022,4 star rating,Came here for a work dinner and sat at the sushi bar counter. It was just two of us and shared a few hand rolls along with a few appetizers and had a few drinks. The sushi was very fresh. The appetizers were really good as well. The ambiance was nice and the service was friendly. Water was always full and they even cut our hand rolls in half since we were sharing which was nice. Overall definitely a win. Might be a little pricey to go solo but highly recommend!

I came around 5 so it was during the happy hour special I got the $26 special and chose tuna chips, scallop and Spicy crab nigiri and spicy crab and lobster hand rolls. I also got a order of lobster and yuzu crispy rice. I enjoyed the tuna chips, scallop ans spicy crab nigiri with my favorite being the scallop nigiri. The hand rolls were ok. I did not like the lobster yuzu crispy rice at all. The service was ok. Friendly but not attentive which was odd being that it was empty in there. They even had a miss hap where they were I didn't revived the last of my order and they went back and forth with me telling me I did only for one of the chefs to have to apologize that he accidently closed out the order."

Everything in the box hits and I will continue ordering this forever."
2095,SBQ0iuFG15rscuArUYDlTg,11/20/2022,4 star rating,"We went to Bondi Nomad for their 5th anniversary special-- $5 hand rolls They had a really great selection of hand rolls that were a part of the special, even the lobster was available! They were also able to make hand rolls that weren't on the menu. I ordered a salmon avocado hand roll. We tried the toro scallion, the yellowtail scallion, the salmon with salmon eggs, the spicy scallop, lobster, salmon avocado. They all tasted really fresh and the chefs who prepared it were very kind and attentive. The yellowtail had a pretty fishy taste to it so it wasn't my favorite but the salmon hand rolls were delicious. The atmosphere was intimate and comfortable. I wish they refilled our water more often or left the jug of tapwater on our table. Otherwise, the wait staff were kind. Happy 5th Birthday, Bondi Sushi!"

They have now put a credit/ debit card reader in that asks for a tip.  They guys working there need to realize a gratuity is for above and beyond service. They hide behind their masks, they are not friendly, in fact if you say hello, often times they don't even reply. They get paid an hourly wage to do their job and in my opinion do not go above and beyond to earn an extra tip. I've been there numerous times and their service is just ""ok"". I hope the owner will discuss what exceeding guest expectations is. Tips are not to be expected. They must be earned."

Best thing are the açaí bowls. It's tasty and a good source of nutrition. They have a few kinds of these. A lot of different toppings to put on. They also have juices and smoothies. I like the Açaí Berry Bowl. It's about $9 for a bowl of goodness. This isn't that bad of a price for how much they give you. It has the frozen açaí purée mixed with almond milk. This is topped with bananas, granola, and peanut butter so it has a good source of protein. It has okay prices for the quality, which is rare around here. It has a decent amount of bowls and smoothies. They're still kind of expensive but that's a common thing."

2103,0k6dQ0Ec2dVo1eZ_tPgr0Q,7/19/2020,4 star rating,Walked in for a refreshing and heavy on the dollar drink. I honestly think this was worth the money for me after walking several hot blocks down midtown streets. I wasn't expecting this and was pleasantly surprised. There is a possibility I can drink out of a young coconut from here someday. The store wasn't very busy. I was able to order and leave within 5-10 minutes. If you can stomach an almost $10 juice made with fresh ingredients (I has expensive taste) than this is going to delight you. If that shocks you a bit then I would probably defer to a grocery down the street.

2107,EKY8DwZVWpkgv6IWrepbWg,4/2/2023,3 star rating,"I visited Namaste on Sunday before a Nets game and I'm not disappointed. It's a good few blocks from the arena, so don't get too tempted on your walk because there is sooo much to eat on 5th Ave alone. If you did get distracted and eat somewhere else, that's ok. Namaste is a good place to eat and move on. The resturant itself is clean and cozy enough. Staff is friendly and attentive. We arrived around noon, we're immediately seated and offered the buffet or a menu to choose from. They weren't rushing us at all, but they weren't busy either. We went with the buffet cause it looked clean and had everything we wanted and gave us the opportunity to try some new stuff. Naan was extra and worth it, the Chicken Tikka Masala was ok (If you order it from the menu, you can apparently order white or dark meat directly for an extra dollar, wish I did that cause the white meat gets a little dry.)The chili chicken was the only thing they had spice to it. , Veggies where kinda delicious. Absolutely nothing negative about this place, a solid 3.5 (so giving them a 4) and a good lunch stop. I'm not unhappy that I ate here, can't say I would return because there are so many other options."
2108,EKY8DwZVWpkgv6IWrepbWg,2/25/2023,4 star rating,"On a search for Indian food and saw this spot in Park Slope offers daily all you can eat lunch buffets (hard to find in this economical climate). Buffet is from 11am-4pm and $16 per person. Came here on a Saturday around 2pm and it wasn't busy at all -- only one other person  dining but 3 more tables came after us. It's self serve and food is inside buffet style trays and kept warm with sternos. However, I felt like the sternos didn't keep the food hot enough. I like my food hot, not warm, so a star off for that. All dishes are labeled. There were lots of vegetarian options and chicken for protein, such as chicken tikka masala, daals, chana saag, variety of sauces, and salad. I wish there were more protein options -- it was only chicken. I have been to Indian buffets where they have chicken, lamb and fish options. Rice is also unlimited and kept warm in the cooker. We were asked if we want naan but didn't realized it's not included with the lunch buffet. It's $4.50 for garlic naan but it's made to order and came fresh and hot. The servers were very attentive and were constantly refilling our water. Overall, it was so good to enjoy a variety of Indian staple dishes with the lunch buffet. The price is unbeatable but I do wish they have better options. I have better Indian lunch buffets where they serve a better variety than this spot for comparable price but overall, this place is a steal. Try it out."
2109,EKY8DwZVWpkgv6IWrepbWg,12/12/2022,2 star rating,"We stopped in the restaurant for the 1st time on a Saturday night during an evening walk. We ordered curry goat, channa masala, the garlic naan (notfor me), an appetizer (didn't eat it but believe it was a cauliflower), and a pineapple juice. It was more than enough food, however, my stomach felt a bit off post the curry goat, basmati rice, and pineapple juice (plus water). My husband didn't have much of the curry goat (just a taste of the sauce), but he assured me that the menu was labeled as this being gluten free. Well, by the time we got home, I wasn't feeling the best though he felt fine. My sense is that there was gluten in the food or something was up with the meat or juice. In any case, I thought this would've been a great find though it's no longer a viable option for me."

Thought we would stop by the area as we had a craving for delicious Indian food. The buffet is always clean and the staff friendly. Our waiter, an older gentleman, (unfortunately didn't catch his name) was so kind. He was attentive and made us feel welcome. Food:I have my favorites already the chicken tikka, saag. Tried a new dish a chicken curry that was fantastic flavor punctuated with mint and cilantro. Really delicious. For a $14 a person price this is a fantastic deal. We always eat just a little too much. It's a shame there aren't more patrons here as the food is so great and so is the vibe. Hope more people stop by. I know I will be back soon for sure! 10/10"

I live nearby and placed an order at around 8:30pm and it was at my door by 9pm, nice and hot. I ordered tandoori chicken and chicken saag. Namaste either accidentally included a papadum order or they gave me one for free. Either way it was an awesome surprise!The tandoori chicken was delicious - very flavorful and moist. The chicken saag was also awesome. I appreciated that neither dish had too much oil and that both came with excellent basmati rice. I loved every bite and can't wait to order from them again. Hopefully I'll get a chance to try out their lunch sometime too!"
2112,EKY8DwZVWpkgv6IWrepbWg,3/12/2023,5 star rating,The food was amazing! I went during the buffet and tried most of it. My favorite was the chicken tikka masala and the chicken curry. The tikka is so good and very soft. The curry is spicy and delicious. The service is great. The servers are very nice. The restaurant is very small but the food is amazing!

But let's get back on track arrived at this location and I'm like ehhhhhhh maybe not but don't judge a book by it's cover. The location is in a really good spot, inside the decor is lacking but it's alright. The lighting was fairly dull that's why I judged lol. For starters I got the chicken somosas and the tofu one. They were finger licking good and they huge ! Not sure if typically that's how large they were but I loved it. For our entree we got butter chicken with garlic naan on the side. It was my first time trying butter chicken and I am quite satisfied. The food was really goood."

The server was attentive and refilled my glass of water, however, I would have liked to have had a spoon for my basmati. There was a bathroom in the back of the restaurant, which was fine. I would like to have seen some Purell hand sanitizer and napkins provided for the customers."

Service was prompt and professional. Everything I requested in my order was completed in a timely manner and with accuracy. I would love to visit this place again in the near future."
2117,coaneiOkJhPMUuXgJOy1YQ,6/17/2022,5 star rating,"So far, 3 for 3. The 3 times I've been here, I've ordered the large peanut butter smoothie, a medium caramel frappe, and a medium strawberry, banana and papaya smoothie and although their smoothies aren't milk-based (like batidos/licuados), so far everything I've tasted here has been absolutely lovely. I would keep coming back as an alternative to the often-crowded Starbucks located in the hospital lobby, whenever I'm visiting the area. They also offer a 10 percent discount to hospital employees (of which I'm not one)."
2118,coaneiOkJhPMUuXgJOy1YQ,6/8/2019,4 star rating,"I'm so happy to have a smoothie shop so close by. The prices are not bad but when you buy a smoothie everyday to replace a meal it ends up adding up. The medium is $5.75 which comes in a decent size plastic cup. The owner is super sweet and always has a smile on her face. I'm in love with the mango smoothie. I've also tried the watermelon lychee, mango banana, and pina colada. The pina colada is my least favorite because the amount of coconut shavings it has. The mango banana is only good when it's really cold. Once it hits room temp it taste like a bad dream. The watermelon smoothie is good but if you're not into lychee it may taste a little sour. Be sure to get their card which allows you to revives a free smoothie after your 8th purchase. They stamp it each time you order. Refreshments are made to order and depending on the time you come there may be a wait. They also have childhood ice creams, chips, snacks, and lotto."

2120,coaneiOkJhPMUuXgJOy1YQ,5/6/2019,5 star rating,This place is underrated!! Their milk tea is amazing and their smoothies as well. They're cash only but they have a stamp reward card (free drink after coming 8 times). A medium sized milk tea with toppings is only $3.50. Their milk teas (I normally get Thai milk tea w/ pudding) are really satisfying and don't taste like powder water like some places make them. Their smoothies and juices are made on the spot so they're super refreshing. The store also has other bottled drinks and snacks including Haagen dazs ice cream and granola bars.
2121,coaneiOkJhPMUuXgJOy1YQ,12/15/2018,3 star rating,"A regular bubble tea place. I haven't heard of this place before, don't think it's a chain. I ordered an original bubble tea with herbal jelly. Large size was $4.50. They also have stamp cards, so be sure to ask for one if you live close and go there often. I only found that place because the bakery down the street didn't serve any drinks, lucky them I guess. They also sell lottery scratch offs."

That was unfortunately the case here, I eventually had to ask about my order and it was one of those situations where they had to hunt it down and ask me to confirm. However, the food and coffee were excellent. I especially love the croissants here, I feel like they are the closest you'll ever find to Europe, from a chain restaurant. Wish I had a Pret A Manger near me!"
2128,ezeG-_W3Eyx4uVuTCYn7yA,7/11/2019,3 star rating,They have a Pret on the East Coast and had no idea they even existed until I visited London this year. I tried to many different food from this restaurant that I would say they have plenty of variety for every person to enjoy. I would say the thing I do enjoy the most is their ready packed sandwiches. If you aren't too hungry they even have half a sandwich packed and ready for you to take to your office. Had the chicken noodle soup which tasted pretty good and really filling. If you want a pretty good lunch option this is the place to be. But what saddens me is if you go a little bit later after lunch the options are way limited to what to decide from. Also the bathrooms at this location were some what insane at how not clean they were.

I really like how they have honey in stock to sweeten beverages with. My peppermint tea tasted great and had the perfect level of sweetness after adding the honey to my drink. My boyfriend also ordered a coffee and be really enjoyed his drink. There were a few milk options and he said it was really good. Would we return?Absolutely!!!
2131,ezeG-_W3Eyx4uVuTCYn7yA,10/11/2018,4 star rating,"What's not to love about Pret? In fact, I have never met anyone in my life who has a single bad thing to say about Pret. There is nothing unique about this particular Pret; in fact it's quite similar to most other Prets. There's a decent amount of seating, but most people usually grab a meal to-go. My favorite item on their menu is the Mediterranean Mezze Salad - it's so healthy, vibrant, and colorful. It consists of falafel, butternut squash, Beet Hummus (a gorgeous fuchsia color!), pomegranate seeds, beets, a mesclun base, harissa chickpeas (adds a nice spicy kick), mint, dukkah spice, and turmeric dressing to top it off! Eating it honestly brightens my day :) In addition, this meal contains enough protein to fill you up for the rest of the afternoon, with the generous portion of falafel and chickpea. This Pret is located conveniently in Midtown next to a ton of office buildings, and the line moves quickly - perfect for an office lunch run."

I really enjoyed it The size is pretty filling and the price is right Really enjoyed it and will have to stop by again to try something else ...The wraps looked pretty inviting Worth stopping by for sure !"

I sent their customer service an email to return my money for the second charge. They decided to give me a $10 creditTowards my next purchase.The food that I was charged twice for was a falafel sandwich on soggy bread. In all fairness, the tuna sandwich was good and their chocolate cookies are really good. Update: they finally refunded the mistake they made."

Great place to grab a drink, pastry, sandwich or some fruit to head over to Bryant Park and enjoy the sights and sounds. Pastries were always fresh, day or night, sandwiches were all good and a solid choice.  Prices were fair and employees were efficient and pleasant!  All members in our party chose food and drinks from this spot as opposed to the Whole Foods across the street.Worth a stop in while out and about in the city. If nothing more to grab the fresh squeezed lemonade/fresh brewed ice tea mix."

While it is probably mostly a take-out/delivery place, we went there for a quick bite for lunch and found them to be polite, welcoming, accommodating and efficient. We enjoyed the food. The rolls and miso soup were tasty and the portions were the market-appropriate size and quality.  They're close by and hopefully reliable, so we'll be back and ordering from them. If anything changes, I'll be back on here to update my review."

I've been a regular at this spot for the last 4 years and 1 new girlfriend later and I'm still coming to this spot and she loves it too! The boardwalk is near by, that plus the metered parking and a whole bunch of no standing spots because of the bus stops and train station on Brighton beach equals a terrible parking situation, I would say be prepared to circle the block a few times. Overall this is an amazing neighborhood spot that can help with any situation dining in on a date, take out for the family and delivery for those lazy days"
2142,1V7TLHWs8FO7iHrRUBgNBA,3/18/2019,3 star rating,"No frills sushi.This is really a 3.5/5 Stars place. Unfortunately yelp does not have a half the star option.This is a dine in review.Staff: Great, friendly and patient. Did not have to ask for refills of water, done automatically. Good staff is very much welcomed in the cozy restaurant. Nothing really much to improve on here except when food is brought to the table. Sometimes the entree is brought out prior to the appetizer. That's not really what customers expect when planning their dinning experience. Not the biggest complaint in the world. Sushi: Very consistent throughout the years. Tasty but nothing too fancy here, nor should they be. It's meant to keep prices down and for the price and value, it's fine. Regular rolls are between $2.50 to $3.00 which is really a bargain. You really can't mess them up. Ginza, Philadelphia, spicy salmon are some of my personal favorites. The dinner/lunch boxes are really great for the money. However, when ordering a teriyaki option within the box, a lot of sauce is used. It should be a favor not a downed in sauce. I'm sure if knowing this, you could ask for less and they would. Shrimp/beef and white fish teriyaki sit on a bed of onions. All good. Appetizers: This can be hit or miss. The ""pizza(salmon)"" and yummy shrimp is great. Both very saucy. Do not by any means get the bbq fish balls. Their quality was worse than microwaveable and I'm sure is not a popular menu item. They were rubbery, no crispness. Seating: Never await and when I went Sunday evening no one was inside but plenty of delivery orders. It's a nice beach option. Bathroom: I enjoy a restaurant with a clean bathroom. There is an air freshener, paper towels, always clean. I also dig that purple wall art with the lady on there.I'll continue to come here and like it for what it is. A simple place to grab a quick bite."
2143,1V7TLHWs8FO7iHrRUBgNBA,3/27/2019,2 star rating,Why do I come back here??Service is terrible.  The waitress actually gave my friend an attitude when she had the nerve to ask for a fork!! And someone please correct me but all the research that I've done has shown me that it is not an insult to anybody's culture when an American asks for a fork in an Asian restaurant!!The salmon skin roll was super dry even with the sticky sweet sauce they poured on it. The white tuna cucumber roll was surprisingly fresh this time and had a good amount of tuna.But having to practically set ourselves on fire to get the waitresses attention when there were only three other occupied tables in the entire restaurant it's something that'll keep me from ever coming back to this place again.

There is no other place in the East Coast with better sushi and I have been looking and there's no place with prices like theirs. It's always the same staff that works there and the dim lighting at night is very warming. They play beautiful music at a low volume so you can enjoy a conversation with people you came with while also appreciating their culture and the atmosphere. If you like spicy things, I highly suggest you order the spicy chicken appetizer. Every time I go, I have to order it twice because it's so good. The only downside of this place is that the water they serve you if you ask for water tastes like tap water, but other then that everything is amazing."

Instead you have to wait until they finish most of the drive through orders before they take yours. We sometimes have to wait 20+ minutes just to place our order. They also prioritize drive through orders so we would have to wait again for order to be prepared. The workers can be hit and miss. Sometimes, the food can be burned and it's not prepared accurately.  A few times, a lot of the certain food items were not available."

2156,gQUPU93Gv1K-qWod6NFqMg,2/22/2023,4 star rating,"My boyfriend and I occasionally like to stay in hotels around the city to spice things up. We choose LIC hotel as a weekend tryst location. Pros The water pressure is better than my house. The best I've experienced in any hotel even ones that cost more. The hot water is hot. Real king sized beds w/ 5 pillows . Comfortable computer desk chair. Refrigerator in the room. Complimentary HOT breakfast EVERY MORNING. This was a god send. French toast, bacon, sausage, boiled & scrambled eggs, bagels, cream cheese/butter/jelly, toast, coffee, tea, apple & orange juice. Close to train, clean and the rooftop is open 24 hours. Great place to play cards, chat, read a book, eat or just relax.Cons  Wifi was very spotty, often didn't work. House keeping doesn't respect the ""do not disturb""sign. Not much place to put luggage. The room door needed to be slammed to close. I left my room door open for a day thinking it was closed. Bed was a little too hard for my taste.Checking in went off without a hitch and I got a great deal on booking.com. So it was definitely cheaper then other hotels in the area. I would stay again."
2157,gQUPU93Gv1K-qWod6NFqMg,4/3/2023,1 star rating,"This hotel was a huge disappointment. My boyfriend saw the reviews for the hotel first before we visited & it convinced us to show up. But it was a disaster checking in and checking out. We were victims of racism by the front desk receptionists. We wish we would have considered elsewhere before considering here. We don't feel they deserved our patronage. Maybe we can help someone else.  We did not receive an apology from the white or latino women at the front desk for assuming I was a PROSTITUTE who didn't have any MONEY. However my boyfriend and I still enjoyed each others company because we are a vibe wherever we go. I was able to address the manager post incident but he did not apologize on front desk behalf either. My boyfriend was shocked because even if I was a prostitute, it IS a hotel. If the front desk can't handle the idea of Black people having sex in a HOTEL, I'm not sure why they are even working there. We felt like it was the 1940s by the way we were being treated. It was INSANE. There are better hotels and Airbnbs to visit with much better treatment of Black people."

The WiFi also worked great.I also liked the breakfast which was included. It wasn't the fanciest breakfast, but it was free and the tables and preparation area looked very clean. Lastly, I loved the rooftop terrace (pictured). Really nice views of the skyline and we would hang out there for a few beverages. Would return if I'm in the city."

We've all tried to dip our naan in tikka masala while walking down the street and it's pretty messy. No? Just me?There are so many options here and different ways you can consume your curries: roti, naan, or bowl. The food comes out fast but the taste and quality is nothing like fast food. Call me vanilla but I got the naan taco with chicken tikka masala and this was a great intro. I will happily be coming back for this and to try more!Naan: 9/10First off, I highly recommend, unless gluten free, you get the naan as your taco shell. It comes out so soft and fluffy, and is massive! It soaks up the curry so nicely but also holds so well together so you can take nice full bites without it falling apart from the weight of the filling. I will try unsuccessfully to get the roti and bowl, because I know I will be craving this naan.Chicken Tikka Masala: 9/10The curry sauce was classic and delicious! The curry is smothered all over the naan and makes it look extremely messy, which is the best. There is no skimping on sauce or curry. The chicken wasn't dry, and I loved all the spices present.I will definitely be coming back here to try more curries and to get the chicken tikka masala naan taco again!"

I first heard about this spot when my friend sent me a TikTok, and it had been on my mind from the moment I landed. Located in West Village, the store itself is pretty small - having little indoor seating, but ample space outside (though that's kinda tough on cold days). The staff were super friendly, and really helpful with whatever questions diners had for them. The food itself was insane - I never actually thought about Indian-Mexican fusion, but it honestly makes sense after having ate here! I ordered the Naan Taco with Paneer Tikka Masala. I loved all the different options they had, even beyond the protein choices they offered Garlic, Onion, Cheese, and other types of Naan! I was honestly surprised by how filling a single taco could be, but these things were huge. THe naan was soft, fluffy, and you could definitely feel the freshness. The Tikka Masala was flavorful, well-seasoned, and perfectly spiced. I'd definitely suggest you grab a ton of napkins - the curry itself was a bit on the watery side, and definitely made the meal pretty messy.Overall, Taco Mahal is definitely on my list of suggestions for places to try in New York, and I can't wait to come back!"

Very small shop with very little indoor seating but a decent amount outside! we ordered the butter chicken plate, the butter chicken taco, lamb biryani and my friend ordered a veggie dish. The butter chicken was so flavorful and insanely tender. the rice was delicious too! my friend was a bit underwhelmed by the lamb dish but he wasn't too hungry and blames it on that. I did try it and thought it was yummy. the food was served pretty quickly and the lady at the front was helpful when we were deciding what we wanted. I thought it was worth the 40 minute Uber lol.

2170,SP4bvMvxel_UPdof_er3HA,3/18/2023,4 star rating,"This place is a little cramped but when I went there weren't too many people there so it worked out. What I love about their menu is that they have a variety of vegetarian and non vegetarian options that you can customize into one of three formats (bowl, roti taco or naan taco). The fusion between Indian and Mexican food is so unique and really tasty. Plus there are a ton of side dishes and many of the menu items are pretty inexpensive. I also like the location because it's great for eating before/after hitting up local night life."

I've been here numerous times and each time I leave happy and satisfied!!You can choose from Roti Taco, Naan Taco or a Basmati Bowl. In my opinion and taste the best item to get is one of the delicious Naan Tacos. You can also try their delicious garlic naan!I almost always get the chicken tikka masala naan taco and lamb kabob naan. These tacos are very filling and taste amazing. All the ingredients and spices are paired together to perfection each time I come here! I suggest you come here hungry and ready to eat!The staff is very friendly and food comes out pretty fast and super hot!Recently the restaurant expanded a bit and added few more tables which is great. Before there was no interior seating except some seats outside on the sidewalk."
2172,SP4bvMvxel_UPdof_er3HA,3/13/2023,4 star rating,"I so enjoyed the theme of this restaurant, however I was expecting them to marry the two distinct cuisines a little better. Perhaps an actual taco that contained both elements of Desi & mexican. Overall this place is more indian cuisine than anything else. I ordered a chicken tikka taco which is chicken tikka in a naan bread meant to be eaten like a taco. The chips & sides were giving what they were supposed to but perhaps actual salsas & chips would of been better. The chai & gukab jamun are a must! It was still absolutely delicious though. Keeping my fingers crossed for a gulab jamun flan or a tikka  Carne asada ."
2173,SP4bvMvxel_UPdof_er3HA,11/30/2022,5 star rating,"4.5 stars: Pretty popular restaurant with a unique fusion concept. You order at the front counter and our food came out really quickly. There's a small amount of indoor seating with additional outdoor seating available. My partner and I got the Veggie of the Day Roti Taco, which was sautéed okra for that day, and the Chana Masala Naan Taco. The presentation of both tacos is cohesive and appealing. The roti taco was pretty small, crispy, and held up nicely. The okra was tasty, well-seasoned, and well-sauteed. Its soft, chewy texture paired excellently with the crisp of the roti shell.We both liked the naan taco more though-- the naan was soft, puffy, and pillowy, and the chana masala was well-spiced, well-seasoned, and tasted really great. It was a little hard to eat in one piece because it's so big and soft, but each component is just so delicious. Overall, these tacos are quite filling, delicious, and have generous amounts of filling."

This twist of Indian style taco was surprisingly good. From their naan bread to curry - they are all delicious to begin with so combining it like a taco was a no brainer! We stopped by after having a slice of pizza and it was still good...!There are about 4-5 tables (including the high table) inside and there are plenty of outside seating. Go with your family for a quick bite and you won't regret if you love Indian food. Thank you, Taco Mahal for creating such delicious menus."
2175,SP4bvMvxel_UPdof_er3HA,2/23/2023,5 star rating,"I cannot believe I have finally just tried this spot. It is a fast-casual Indian taco spot. The saag paneer on the naan bread was our favorite! This is a must-order. I also tried the chicken tikki masala and while it was good; the chicken was a little dry so I prefer to have the paneer. The tiki masala was on the sweeter side. I got this on the roti and 100% recommend getting the naan bread every single time. The roti was good but the one on the naan was exponentially better.  I also tried the samosas which were fine, I would not order them again. But I will definitely be back for a saag paneer on naan!"

(Sorry Italia, there's just nothing like a New York slice, baby!) The owner and staff are wonderful, hardworking people, the pizza is good and asking to reheat it to ""extra crispy"" is the move. Plus if you're looking for ways to reduce your waste in this world, they won't look at you like you're crazy when you ask them to put your to-go pizza on your ceramic plate that you brought down from your apartment!"

My favorite thing about Bardolino's is their hours, they tend to be open when all other pizza places have closed. A good NYC takeout pizzeria!"

And why are they charging this fee when they don't serve you? Next, the prices are so high and not worth it. I had to pay $3 extra for a piece of bread to go with my $6 sausage, and an extra $3 for sauerkraut. Furthermore, the options there were totally different than what was on the online menu. No soup at all! Staff very aloof and not very helpful. Beer wasn't bad but $14 for a liter a bit high too and there's a service charge on that! Was nice that they make it there themselves and I liked that they took the tap out of a whole wall with the others. Garlic French fries were very good but cold!

The focus is certainly on eastern European beers with plenty of options from Germany, Czech Republic, Poland, and more. There are mostly macro options with a few craft ones from breweries such as Dog Fish Head and Allagash.The draft system is rather odd. Every tap has a special nozzle which only fills into a plastic bottle. In order to have a beer in a cup or glass, it is necessary to fill up a bottle first. I find that wasteful. They do have recycling bins separated from other garbage, so I do appreciate that initiative.They have a beer garden outside with about a dozen tables wrapping around shore parkway and Sheepshead bay road. The service is quick and the pricing is reasonable. They have a lot of snacks including dried fishes - a traditional  Russian snack while drinking beer."

They have a wide variety of beers to choose from. They offer any size from half a litter to two litters and pour your beer into a bottle and give you a cup to drink from. I had the Pilsner (my favorite) and then a grapefruit beer which was very light and yummy. The food was great and went along with the beer just perfectly! - the cold smoked fish... I had half of It on my own and definitely did not have a single regret! - the fried bread crackers were definitely a treat and something to get when brought out hot. It is served with a sour cream like dip- the fried calamari was good but nothing to go crazy over- I did not try the fried fish but was told It was great!! The prices aren't cheap but they aren't horrendous in my opinion. Definitely worth the visit!"

The pasta on top has a creamy sauce to it. I was worried it would be hard or crunchy especially baked on top of the pizza, however, it was cooked perfectly! It melted together like it was meant for each other. My biggest regret was not coming back for it the next day! The spinach mushroom wasn't the greatest. Definitely give the pasta pizza a try!"

I was working with a not-for-profit planning a memorial lunch last weekend with a limited budget, and we ordered over the phone using the online menu. We were quoted a price with tax; we needed to bring in our proof of status to avoid tax. Totally normal/proper. But then upon going in, we were quoted a pre-tax total nearly 25% higher. It was completely unacceptable, and we really felt cheated and subjected to a bait-and-switch--especially being a not-for-profit feeding people at a *memorial*. That alone is the reason for missing stars.They did do a great job on the actual catering, but at the higher prices they now say they charge (which you can't see online), we would have just gone with somewhere closer to the venue rather than schlepping food to ""save money."" I can't and wouldn't say to avoid them--the food is great, the portions are exactly what you'd wish for, the guys are nice.

So I went to Yelp (Thanks) and found ""Famous Amadeus Pizza"" not to far from my location. I called and spoke to Jose. He was very polite and friendly over the phone. I let him know I wanted six pies and would order them the next day. He said ""okay, have a good day."" The next day around twelve I called. Jose answered again and like before he was happy. I reminded him who I was and he took his time with me going over the menu. He helped me pick the best choices and went over the price. Once that was done I told him I needed it on Thursday cat eleven thirty and he said no problem. The day of the meet the managers were hungry. I was going on and on and they ignored me, thinking about food. I have to be honest about this, I had one issue. I told them the time and they came late. We all at the point were starving. When the delivery biker came, we quickly grabbed the pies. My assistant paid him and we took the pizza to the managers. I have to say, I've never seen pizza go so fast. Particularly the broccoli, mushroom, tomato pie. It all went quickly. My favorite was the chicken and onions pie, but they all had a good vibe about them. We enjoyed it so much, I decided to make this the pie of meetings going forward. I even called Jose to thank him, but he didn't answer another guy did, who didn't care for my admiration and just hung up. Go figure, I mean it's Manhattan people!"

The outer crust was really good, light, crunchy, what a great pizza eating experience. I will get this pizza again!!"

Simply yuck.Just give people what they ordered, or if they point out that you're wrong, don't blame them for it!!!Note-- they will say that the supreme has broccoli on it, but their website says it DOES NOT. I told them I would send them a screenshot or show them what their website says and they said they didn't care and to call tomorrow to speak to ""Amadeus"" and that basically they didn't care.Doesn't everyone know that a supreme does not include broccoli? Well, even though they don't, their website specifically says it does *not* include broccoli. Check the screenshots.Dealing with their incompetence will waste an hour of your life and waste your appetite.Appalling customer service; appalling pizza; appling management; appalling workers. None of them were willing to correct their mistake."

From the beckoning neon sign, to the intimate booths, this place calls out to us anytime we're returning home from dinner or drinks elsewhere. It is the perfect spot for a nightcap drink with the husband or friends - many a night have ended this way. They are the type of cocktail bar that will have something for everyone, and it will be done WELL. One of my personal go to's is the Night Shift (their take on an espresso martini).One thing I will say is that it can get a little loud for a cocktail bar, mostly because it is always packed but the seating is set up in a way that definitely helps solve for it. It's a go to for 2-4 people. More people, and I might go to one of the more spacious options nearby. And, we've heard they have an awesome garden in the back for outdoor seating, but it's only open during warmer months and we always remember when it's too cold..."
2207,PcF_ebeELn7mg6vqVnHjIg,3/5/2023,4 star rating,"Stopped in on their Friday happy hour. Not the greatest old fashion, but the decor and ambiance really make up for it. They've successfully mastered the art of creating lots of somewhat private feeling spaces in an open floor bar. I'd go back and explore the non happy hour menu next time I'm in the area. Elsa, you've left your mark on me!"
2208,PcF_ebeELn7mg6vqVnHjIg,3/4/2023,3 star rating,"We stopped by for happy hour prior to dinner. The interior was like a high-end diner with a few booths under dark lighting. I do not recall if there was any music in the background so it was perfect as we could actually hear one another without shouting. The space is small so the tables are close to each other. There was no happy hour menu online so I was excited to see what the options were. There were only two drink options for 8 dollars which were an old fashioned and a wine punch. They have sunday pilsner for 6 and either a glass of grenache or sauvignon blanc for 6. I tried the wine punch with Rose, Gin, St Germaine, Lime, honey and bitters. It was underwhelming. For my next drink, I decided to try something off the happy hour menu. I tend to go for tequila/mezcal based cocktails. I tried the hotel danger for 14 dollars. It was much better than the wine punch. I'm not sure if this is place I'll return to given all the better options in Manhattan."
2209,PcF_ebeELn7mg6vqVnHjIg,2/15/2023,5 star rating,"I loved Elsa. I was a little nervous before coming in because it looked quiet and not the vibe I was looking for but I was pleasantly surprised. They had good music playing (hip hop, rnb) and their drinks were super good. The only downside is they close at 2am on Saturday which is early imo and I think everyone else since they stayed until closing. I would return again."

The drink menu offered a fun, unique set of flavor pairings. And, the drinks were super good. She's a drinker & she enjoyed. They made a mocktail version of a popular drink for me & it was delish. Great service! A nice, fun crowd goes here as well from families to young professionals who mingle. Recommend for ppl who want to meet new people. The bathroom was really cute & full of air fresheners that maintain a fresh scent as well.I'd definitely return!Go, enjoy!"

Strangely enough we were the only two brown folk there at the time. The place is narrow but not petite. Seemingly a shade of white walls with bar seating to the right & table top seating to the left. Straight in the back is a garden. Just have to climb down a few stairs. I had the Broken Mirror & talk about strangely yummy. The waitress was lovely. Also, we had a cheese board that was yummy too. All & all, it was a cool experience. Check it out if you're in the mood for a date or a night out with friends."
2214,PcF_ebeELn7mg6vqVnHjIg,7/25/2022,5 star rating,Great spot to stop for a drink at the bar (didn't order any food)! The drinks are creative and delicious. The staff was very friendly and always made sure our water glasses were full as well. I highly recommend the Self Portrait that has cilantro tequila. Runs about $14-15 per cocktail so not crazy expensive for a great drink.
2215,PcF_ebeELn7mg6vqVnHjIg,6/8/2022,5 star rating,"This is my new favorite neighborhood bar! Drinks are reasonably priced ($14-$16) and they have a happy hour on select drinks (I believe beer, wine and 1 cocktail). Very unique cocktails on their menu but they also make great classics. The interior is very cute with a lot of seating or you can also grab a drink at their bar! Now that the weather is nicer, I can't wait to grab a drink in their large backyard. Perfect for a date or catching up with some friends! It gets a little hard with large groups, max inside is probably 6 to a table."

So nice to be able to enjoy a cool fall afternoon.For lunch, the kale salad is so fresh and satisfying. The egg sandwich is a popular breakfast choice. Two fried eggs, cheese and delicious sauce. So good. Want something warm on a breezy afternoon? The lamb chili was perfect. Dip the baguette slices in the lamb chili. Yum! Add a latte and you have a perfect meal with family or friends."

2218,szM1B9tHQixNsmTZTfKoWA,11/19/2022,4 star rating,"A neighborhood favorite, the egg sandwich is so simple with its egg and cheese, but the bread and the eggs are always cooked perfectly. Roll is consistently so soft. $7 with tax and tip but it's a nice treat. I've tried all the others in the area like Lula Bagel, Colina Cuervo but they don't compare. Some indoor high chairs and a few tables outside. Seems like a popular date spot or casual hangout with friends. Service is good."
2219,szM1B9tHQixNsmTZTfKoWA,6/21/2022,4 star rating,"Nice restaurant that's well executed. Prices a little on the higher side but you can tell the food is good quality. Portions are decent too. I opted for the rotisserie chicken sandwich, which was like a warm chicken salad. It had good flavor with a nice crunch and was served on quality bread. Staff was very helpful in helping me decide what to get and how much food I needed. Service took a little longer while but not unreasonably long. Everyone was working hard. I'm only giving it 4 Stars because of overall value, but I think this is a great spot for a casual spot."

First, they have outdoor seating with Wi-Fi and you can bring your dog! I saw a lot of folks working from here, so be mindful. The service was great! The staff took my order quickly and brought out the food. You will need to get water/ utensils/ napkins by yourself inside. I got their rotisserie chicken sandwich which they seemed to be pretty well known for. I personally do t like celery in my sandwich so I just picked them out (easy since they were bigger pieces). The sandwich came warm with large pieces of white and dark meat. This was enough to satisfy me for several hours. Tip: grab enough napkins because it can get messy."

But biting through the broccoli was a bit messy as the stocks of these vegetables can be pretty tough... but this is a combo that I would never have put together myself! And for my peeps who can't do the spice, as a warning it has pepper flakes that give it some heat as you are eating it. The vibes to this place is very chill. People definitely coming and going. The ones who stay are trying to be busy on their laptops lol. Great local spot in the neighborhood to check out!"
2224,szM1B9tHQixNsmTZTfKoWA,7/14/2022,4 star rating,"I stopped by on a very hot day for a cool drink, and the special of the day, the watermelon agua fresca ($5), was exactly what I needed. It tasted exactly like watermelon in liquid form and was absolutely perfect and refreshing. I honestly don't really know how tipping works anymore when you're ordering a drink to go, so I gave $1 when prompted, but it did feel a little weird to pay almost $7. Overall, I liked it a lot - my one issue was that there wasn't really AC here, so I did not want to linger inside."
2225,szM1B9tHQixNsmTZTfKoWA,4/29/2022,4 star rating,Cute place with nice outdoor seating.  Always packed on the outside but high turn over so your sure to score a seat for a quick bite. Very laid back vibe. Food has been consistent here. My favorite is the burger always cooked delicious to medium and fries are also crispy and perfectly fried. I have tried the other breakfast sandwiches and they did not disappoint either.  Pretty solid place all around.
2226,NcHnZbq06y9llCt6ayf_Jw,4/2/2023,5 star rating,"Sweet chick is a great fast casual American food spot to grab lunch with friends! I'd come back for the casual vibe and crunchy wafflesTheir waffles are definitely worth trying; they're airy and crunchy on the outside, but soft and moist on the inside. The chicken is slightly salty when eaten separately but pairs well with the waffle and caramel sauce. The hash browns looked like waffles and were similarly tasty (crunchy but light), but I probably wouldn't order them again as I was expecting McDonald's hash browns. Service is casual but prompt, you can choose where to sit and there aren't specific waiters assigned to your table. You order from QR codes on your table, and food takes about 10-15 minutes to get to your table. The ambiance is fast / casual, it's the sort of lunch spot that serves drinks in clear plastic cups and you and spend an afternoon chilling at with friends. It's a bit dim inside but there's plenty of seating and an outdoor bench area."
2227,NcHnZbq06y9llCt6ayf_Jw,2/19/2023,3 star rating,"My friend and I had an ""Instagram vs Reality"" experience this weekend when we had brunch at Sweet Chick.I don't post negative reviews online unless I've already expressed my concern/disappointment with the establishment, which I did, so this is a cautionary tale for anyone else heading to the LIC location:As you can see from the photos attached, our veggie chicken & waffle dish was visually unappealing and overall not what we had expected or hoped.As I think another reviewer mentioned, the waffles were cold and kind of stale. The ""crispy chicken"" looked like frozen nuggets from a kids' meal menu. So much so that we thought we accidentally ordered the wrong thing, but were told that there had been some changes in ingredients and food vendors and those were, in fact, the correct dishes.The servers were apologetic and generally nice, but not much could be done to make up for the below par food, unfortunately."
2228,NcHnZbq06y9llCt6ayf_Jw,1/8/2023,2 star rating,"I really wanted to like this location, but just like the Flatbush location the food just fails terrible. I got the shrimp and grits and Mac and cheese, husband got the honey and garlic chicken and waffles. Nothing was good. We each left about half of our food uneaten. The grits was all oil and no flavor, the chicken was wet and only had seasoning on the skin/batter. The Mac literally had no flavor, like it wasn't even boiled in salt water much less. The space itself was cool, greenery and good space between tables. Disappointed."
2229,NcHnZbq06y9llCt6ayf_Jw,1/3/2023,5 star rating,"So good I order it once a week - their bone-in chicken is moist, flavorful, and waffles are crispy but soft. Comes with a flavored butter and maple syrup! Their Nashville chicken is spicy and pairs perfectly! Loaded waffle fries were also amazing. They have seat yourself service, order via QR code - even though we didn't have a designated server, multiple staff members came over to make sure we were doing okay which was appreciative."
2230,NcHnZbq06y9llCt6ayf_Jw,2/20/2023,5 star rating,Always a good time when I eat here! Love the music and the decor. You can always jam out to their throwback hip hop & R&B. I love their fried chicken preferably the breast(white meat only) with Classic waffles. Adore their raspberry butter and their mac & cheese is superb! Never disappoints! I don't like their fries..they kinda tasted like frozen fries! I was told that their chicken sandwiches are pretty good too so i look forward to going again and trying a new item off the menu!

The only time of contact is when the waiters bring out the food.My friends and I ordered the Honey Garlic Chicken and Waffles (1 with tenders, and 1 with bone-in), and the Nashville Hot Chicken and Waffles. The tenders were a bit hard, but the bone-in chicken was fried to perfection. Their waffles were pretty solid! Also, their flavored butters were great (not sure the flavors, but I think one of them tasted like lemons).PS. Their sweet tea is not very sweet."

We ordered a few things to share and we highly recommend the 4pc Soy Honey Garlic boneless chicken and waffles! The sauce was delicious and not overwhelming. The waffles were fluffy and paired up with their speciality butter made it all the better!We also ordered their fried Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich that was served on a Martin's potato bun. This was our least favorite because the seasoning and batter was very dry. The spice was on point though! As for sides, we ordered brussel sprouts which we enjoyed a lot and classic crinkle fries! This place is casual, you order by the QR code that's on the tables and they bring it out to you. We came here on a hot Saturday morning and the restaurant was kinda hot? They should turn up the AC during hot summer days. Knocked off one star because of the dry Nashville hot chicken and the hot interior. But I would definitely come again for their chicken and waffles!"
2234,NcHnZbq06y9llCt6ayf_Jw,12/17/2022,3 star rating,"If you have all been reading my reviews, you know I love a good chicken n waffle. Sweet chick got recommended right away, and for my first experience, it was ok. The restaurant has a friendly hip-hop vibe to it. It's pretty interesting because you order everything through a QR code, and the staff is only there to bring food to you. The team I did talk to were kind and helpful. Since it was my first time, there was a bit of a slip-up in my order. It's important to note if you don't specify if you want white or dark meat, the sweet chick will automatically give you chicken breast, and as a person who is a dark meat lover, I was a tad disappointed. The manager was there and was very accommodating and sent me over two chicken wings. The wings were hot and delicious. I feel they could have used a bit more seasoning. The waffles were good, depending on how you like your waffles. I like my waffles a bit more crispy, and I enjoyed the touch of apple and Cinnamon. My friend got the chicken sandwich he ate in two seconds, and his wife got the Honey garlic chicken strips and waffles, which were good as well. I washed it down with a big small inspired old-fashioned, which was fine. Overall, the environment was relaxed. It reminds me a lot of Parsons. The chicken and waffles were decent. I would love to give them another try. I understand why people are going for the online style of ordering but having a person to explain how you want your food prepared goes a long way. The issues I had could have been solved with a waiter, especially for first time customers. Based on this first experience and the food and flavor, I can only give them a 3 1/2. I have had a lot of chicken and waffles this year, and Sweet chicks are good but for my taste. I put some spots above. Solid 3 1/2 out of 5"
2235,NcHnZbq06y9llCt6ayf_Jw,10/11/2022,3 star rating,I am a huge fan of Sweet Chick so to give them 3 stars hurts. I am giving the 3 stars because my main course was not good at all. It was disappointing the chicken had no flavor at all! It was just crunchy and even when I put hot sauce it didn't do it for me. The cheese grits were great and the mimosa. I was able to sit immediately and my food didn't take long to come out. The staff was friendly and nice. I did like the contactless option to order your meal. It could have been an off day but I think I will try the Williamsburg location again because the chicken was perfect.
2236,l2yAaU9fBm2Gg828ysI-nw,4/1/2023,4 star rating,"Neighborhood pizza joint serving serviceable slices and pies. Narrow entrance to order and pick up with some seating in the back. Came on a Friday night around 6pm and they were slammed with orders. It took about 40 minutes to get our 2 pies tor pickup (from what they said on the phone was a 25 minute wait). They are courteous and did apologize for the wait time which I appreciate - rare in a Queens joint. They may need to figure out a better system behind the counter for their weekend rush. Roughly $52 for 2 pies - a veggie pie and a regular cheese pie with half pineapple. It was about $28 for the veggie pie we ordered that was alright. I liked how the veggie pie included breaded eggplant in addition to the usual broccoli, tomatoes, and mushrooms. A plus: they do have pineapple as a topping (a hit with my kids) which is rare these days. I added a star because we want to support local businesses. This is a standard Queens pizza place."

What I don't suggest is their Philly Cheese Steak hero. I ordered it with lettuce, tomato, mayo & cheese on a hero with fries and their free can of soda meal online. The meat taste so gross and it's barely even a dark color. I couldn't even take more than 2 bites so I just ate their fries. Next time I'll just stick with what I usually get."

The good: they're generous with their toppings and they are high quality. And the guys behind the counter have always been friendly to me. But the crust often has issues, it somehow manages to be both burned or charred on the bottom and limp. Other times it's thin and crispy and perfectly cooked."
2243,l2yAaU9fBm2Gg828ysI-nw,2/3/2021,2 star rating,"I ordered from this place via the Slice app, where it has an overall 5.0 stars with 500 ratings. So I had high hopes. I ordered the sausage calzone and an Italian salad. The description of the calzone says it includes red sauce, but when the order arrived - no red sauce. I contacted the Slice app support and they said that red sauce has to be requested. There's no place to indicate that, unless you write it in yourself under ""special requests"". The Calzone itself was pretty mediocre - not the worst, but certainly nothing among the better ones I've had elsewhere. Definitely lacked a sufficient amount of sausage. The description for the Italian salad includes onions and ""of course pepperoncini!"" which is what makes an Italian salad an Italian salad, right?  Well, my salad didn't include those either. I do contact-less delivery, and the delivery guy seemed pretty curt. Just dropped the food at the door without saying a word. No response to my cordial ""thank you, have a good night.""  Just a very unsatisfactory experience. Also seeing that on Yelp this place gets nowhere near 5 stars is pretty telling (of the pizzeria, but maybe of the Slice app users too)."

So-so reviews, but a pretty solid menu with lots of different choices for pies and slices... so my wife and I drove over to check it out.7ish on a Sat night. Only a few slices out and they looked hours old. I didn't see the kind of slice I wanted and when I asked they said they were out of it - but didn't offer to make one. At 7 on a Sat... seems like you'd have a fresh pie out where you could throw a few toppings on a slice, or putting a new pie in would seem worth it with so much of the night left. My wife and I exchanged the ""should we just leave"" look, but we were hungry, so we each got a slice - and while it wasn't that bad, it tasted as old as it looked. Would likely have been much better when it was fresh - like I would have assumed it would be at 7 on a Sat night. I mean they close at 10! Really couldn't throw on a new pie? If they had, we'd have taken two slices each (half the pie) and maybe been back.So, again, ehh. A shame the selection that drew me in wasn't offered."

I love this deli for a plectrum of reasons. 1) Affordable: You can essentially get an entire meal for under $10 which is difficult to come across in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. There are daily breakfast and lunch specials that come with a free beverage, you can't beat that! 2) Friendly Staff: I am always greeted with a smile and a Good Morning/Afternoon 3) The food is delicious: Whether you decide to get breakfast or lunch here, you're not disappointed. I've had various selections (chicken & broccoli, salmon, rice, lo mein, etc.) from the buffet, a bacon, egg, & cheese with a hashbrown on a toasted bagel, and a fruit smoothe here.

Which defeated the purpose of wearing gloves. I immediately lost my appetite. I ended up eating my sandwich I got the turkey and ham with cheese. It was pretty good but the roll seemed a little old. They did put a lot of meat which was nice, but again he contaminated it. My boyfriend for the chicken pesto sandwich and he liked it but agreed this is a 3 star place. It could have used more filing. Good place to come for sandwiches and they have a bar full of various hot and cold foods but they just need to be cleaner. Inside It looks like a drug store mixed with a cheap buffet. Overall, this place has cheap food that's not actually that cheap?!"

Although I frequented their salad bar, their hot food bar looked good too. The salads provided me a healthy yet filling meal to go about my classes.Their salad was any 5 toppings, plus the base and chicken you chose for 7.57 after taxes. Having a great amount of selections to choose from was definitely a plus. Avocado could have been one of the 5 toppings which is amazing. Their sauce selection for the salads was more than enough. The guys preparing your salad are always happy to help.Elim is a great place to get food from and their prices are not outrageous for an upper east side location. They are conveniently located and are delicious as well. Definitely appreciate this place for being there as an alternative and a location that serves amazing food."

I chose 2 eggs, bacon and potatoes. This was $4.50 !! The amount they gave was SO MUCH !On the side, i got some salad, avocado, and shrimp because I wasn't expecting such a huge portion.I only took a pic of the main thing I got but everything was really tasty."

2257,DHFEpeJXemrdxIuGGcyurg,1/28/2022,3 star rating,"**Delivery Review**Saturday morning, placed an order for breakfast through Yelp. Pretty much the full menu available in the morning, which is better than the usual brunch options.Between two people, ordered the Huevos Rancheros ($11), Enchiladas de Pollo con Mole Poblano ($18), and de Mole Nachos ($10). Foods arrived within the delivery window, mostly lukewarm. Enchiladas are two wrapped tortillas filled with chicken, cheese, veggies, and mole sauce. Chicken was under-seasoned but the accompanying mole helped as it drenched the entire dish. There was a side of rice and beans as well which were also plain. Nachos were much better, though not layered because it would have been too soggy by the time it arrived (good call). Chips are hearty and the Guacamole/salsa/sour cream are all spot on (wish there was melted cheese). Huevos Rancheros are pretty straight forward, could have used more jalapenos but it's nitpicking.Fine enough food that probably it's better in person. Will try again at some point."

The restaurant has a cute patio outdoor  seating, it was empty and we felt they were almost closed. The server was nice enough to seat us.They have a great menu for meat eaters as well as vegetarians! Omg the tamales are to die for! So authentic. Definitely will go back to try more of the tamales.We ordered veggie enchiladas and veggie Fajitas! Enchiladas were delicious in green sauce, but the Fajita's were mind blowing, the veggies had such great flavors! Cant find anything similar to that in the city.Cant wait to go back and enjoy the food, service and cute vibe!"

2260,DHFEpeJXemrdxIuGGcyurg,7/17/2022,2 star rating,I love the food here but the price went up big time. I had brunch here today it was very delicious but the waitress messed up my order. I haven't been here in awhile & was upset at how much the prices have gone up. I usually get the Huevos rancheros which is what I got today & I usually get a small guacamole for like 2-3.00 but she bring a a little bit bigger one with chips so I said ok I'll just have this. She brings me the bill & to my surprise the guacamole was 13.00 more than the meal was. The huevos rancheros was only 10.00 but I can remember when it was 8.00. Anyways I told her how ridiculous the price was for the guac & I said small but she or they did not offer to adjust my bill. Very upset because I really love this place. I guess next time I'll do without the guac.

Not complaining; more for your awareness since it's easy to get distracted doing other things.The first time we ordered:Chicken de mole - it was great... Hands down.Chicken burrito - I liked it... My friend not so much after the de mole.Second time we ordered:Steak de mole -- my friend liked the chicken better since he didn't realized the steak was so small.Chicken burrito - still as good to me.Steak Nachos - pretty good.  One recommendation if the place reads this.  Could you put the nachos on the side away from the liquid?  Some of the nachos were soggy when you pick up the nachos.  It would have been fine in the restaurant though for takeout/home delivery there needs to be some adjustments.Definitely a place to go to especially since they open late.  Thank you guys!"

Everyone can find sth here to satisfy their sweet tooth (or teeth in my case lol)I was craving Mochi and got the red bean Mochi and the mango Mochi. They are otherworldly good! The texture was so so so soft and yet have the perfect amount of chew. Your teeth would just sink into the skin when you bite into them - honestly they are so soft that you don't even need teeth to eat them! The mango one is my favorite - ample refreshing fresh mango chunks on the inside that adds another layer of flavor and texture to the whole Mochi experience! The Mochi balls were covered in coconut shreds which was so fragrant and elevated the mochis even more!I inhaled them so fast that I didn't even breathe in between! LOLI'm still dreaming about these mochis days after I devoured them. And I'm reminiscing every bite of them as I wrote."

I first stopped by here on a hot September afternoon after playing spikeball in Central Park for 2 hours, and I couldn't bear my hunger any longer before heading to another restaurant in Chinatown so I dropped by here for a mantou, and it was one of the most satisfying experiences of my life. I took 1 bite, and I don't remember what happened to the rest of it because it disappeared so fast. It's just the right amount of sweetness and super soft, and I happened to stop by this evening after my haircut in Chinatown to buy a whole bag of them."

2273,RHz7OAoy5yMNWBcLArgLrQ,2/21/2023,1 star rating,The workers need to change their attitude. They are very unpleasant. You also need to ask the price before you order a drink there because you cannot see the price for each drink. The drink I ordered was overpriced. It was a regular lemonade but  the price was way higher than the other bakeries.

Ordered smash burger, got the veggie burger, server forgot my dipping sauce for fries. Got it sorted, burger was fine. My husband liked his egg dish. Nice place to have a drink and watch the match, he freaking loved his espresso martini. Maybe skip the food though and just sit at the bar."
2280,XO3yD87rTPz9o6Dy9qRaJg,3/18/2023,1 star rating,Bartender towards the back of the bar the evening of March 18th with the beard was the worst human being. He took my order for a beer I accidentally knocked over for a guy next to me but then refused to take my order. He yelled at me that I interrupted him when he was making a large drinking order and had security come over and escort me out. I was just a customer putting in my order after he got the beer that I knocked over yet I became his punching bag. What an embarrassment of an establishment.
2281,XO3yD87rTPz9o6Dy9qRaJg,5/30/2022,4 star rating,"I started with the new ""Drunken Love"" cocktail, a tasty concoction of tequila, aloe liqueur (a fresh first for me), watermelon juice and salted honey. It was light, refreshing and a tasty way to kick off our meal.For food, we started with an order of the chips and French onion dip, which was without a doubt the best I've ever had -- it's on a completely different level from the stuff that comes in a can. Each bite was packed with flavor with strong notes of onion (obviously) and garlic. The crispy house-made chips complemented the chips well.For my entree, I ordered the Smash Burger -- two delicious beef patties topped with American cheese, lettuce, pickles and a generous spread of burger sauce. The beef was juicy and flavorful, and the burger sauce added a tangy note to each bite. The fluffy sesame seed bun did a good job of holding everything together.I was surprised that the burger didn't come with a side, and the waiter didn't ask if I wanted a side -- the burger was filling so I didn't need fries, but it would have been nice to at least be asked.The service was decent. We waited for quite some time because the waiter had not seen that we were seated. That was partially due to being seated in a corner of a room crowded with people standing for a birthday party. Granted, we were told that it was loud in the room and asked if we would rather sit outside. We opted for the inside and ended up regretting it as the group got louder and louder (and closer and closer to our table) as the night went on. This place definitely has more of a standing-room-only bar than a sit-down restaurant, so that's something to consider if you're looking for something a little more low-key."
2282,XO3yD87rTPz9o6Dy9qRaJg,2/24/2023,1 star rating,Weird vibe at this place. The bouncer insisted on carding me at the door. I am 69 years old and look 69 years old. When we ordered drinks at the table the waitress insisted  that she swipe a credit card. I guess so that we 69 year olds don't run out on a check ? I will never go back to this weird bar.

The cocktails look and sound delicious, and I'll definitely be back to try! I instead ordered the pineapple cider which was delicious and not too sweet! We got the calamari to snack on - the portion was really quite small, and came with a lemon and mayonnaise."

His shoes fell of, he fell down in the street, anand no help was offered, even as a car was coming directly towards him. Really really disturbing behavior & completely unnecessary given that no one had expressed a problem with the person. I understand the bouncer probably handles a lot of BS throughout the night but this was an extreme response for a relative non-issue, and made my friends and I leave the line (I think a few others, too)."
2285,XO3yD87rTPz9o6Dy9qRaJg,3/6/2023,1 star rating,"I have never experienced such terrible service and attitude towards a customer. I was with my family and friends and ordered drinks at the bar. To begin with the bartender, Brian Lerner, had a stinky attitude, so I left him a 15% tip on the first order. When we went to reorder drinks, he purposefully ignored my friend and I for 10 minutes. Finally when we managed to order a drink, Brian set down the drinks and said, ""I will not give you the drinks until you give me a card."" I therefore proceeded and told him I would pay him cash. I was not happy with his condescending manner and had no intention on tipping him for the bad service now. When I collected the cash I was $1 short and had only 4 quarters so I gave them. He proceeded to tell me that he did not accept coins and I told him that is what I had, which was true. The bill was paid in full. I did not purposefully give him coins. He then called over security to escort me out of the bar. Nor was I drunk or being disrespectful. On the contrary, the disrespect and ill attitude all came from Brian. You would think that customers should be treated nicely, but Brian had not a drop of hospitality in his behavior. Maybe he was having a bad day, but that gives him absolutely no right to be disrespectful nor kick me out of the bar. If I was misbehaving, I understand the actions that were taken, but that was not the case. Bartenders like Brian Lerner have no place in the hospitality industry. Whoever hired this person should really reconsider the staff they are hiring. Anyone that comes across this bartender, please run the other way and never hire him to work for you!"

We made reservations at 6pm but didn't know that in order to have the full table next to our lane, you need to book 2 lanes as the table is in between. Honestly the website doesn't warn about this and we weren't told at the reservation desk so we booked one lane for 8 people. After starting bowling and ordering a full table of food we were then told that we would have to share the table with another group which in our state was incredibly awkward as we had covered the table in food we ordered. At that point we weren't able to book the other lane as well and the entire set up is terrible for larger parities and we really should have been told we should have booked the other lane as well. Moving on to the food - we ordered salads, ribs, wings, and fried chicken to share. Honestly everything was pretty below average with the ribs and wings having the same overly sweet sauce and the chicken was crunchy but had no seasoning and we even thought it lacked salt. I would recommend not eating here if possible. The live band was fun but the service and food were just terrible. I would not recommend coming with a larger group. Also do be warned that the sound system is very loud when there's a band and it's difficult to talk with your group with the music on."

We bought tickets for this past Saturday's 2000 music show 03/04/2023, and because they had a show previou to ours we had to wait outside until the folks that were inside left. Once inside, the music from the prior event played an additional 40 minutes or so. It was ridiculous. It all just felt so unorganized. As if that wasn't bad enough, the bouncer that was working the line had a horrible attitude. Brooklyn Bowls needs a serious makeover and some serious employee training."

The food was delicious!! And I was so happy because I was starving lol I ordered the special of the day which was blackened catfish that came with mash potatoes and collard greens. My date ordered something light (calamari) because he ate beforehand. I ended up eating his food too! Our bowling experience was also pleasant. The couches were comfortable, the venue was very clean. There was even a hand sanitizing station under the keypad which blew my mind! The only critique I would say is the music was not hitting the way I would have hoped. Also it was a tad bit cold so if you do go, make sure to bring a sweater! All in all, I would definitely recommend!"

2295,wQFq2ZbUG40H1KfXTjgkBw,9/25/2022,1 star rating,"Ugh, I really hate writing bad reviews and I hardly do, but I had an awful time at this establishment. My partner and I came on a Saturday night for date night. Coming into the night, we knew we'd have to wait for an hour or so for a lane, so we prepared to eat while waiting.Upon entering, be prepared to pay cash as the cover fee if they have a band playing for the night. There's nothing on their website that mentions if you plan to just bowl you still have to pay for the tickets, so that caught us off guard. We paid $30 in cash to get in; they don't accept card for entry.At their restaurant we ordered their 1/2 dark chicken which comes with 2 drumsticks, 2 wings, mashed potatoes, and collard greens with bacon. We also ordered a plate of the Mac n cheese. The food was fantastic; the chicken was juicy with a crunchy exterior and the Mac n cheese was super cheesy and gooey.We started running into problems when it came to actually bowling. After finishing our meal, we asked the front desk how much longer until our names will be called. They said there were three groups ahead of us. An hour passes by, so we ask again and it turns out our number was miswritten. Mistakes happen, so we shrug it off.Bowling was fun, and the music was great but more problems arose when we were paying out. The bowling alley closes at 1, so our game was stopped at around 12:56. When we got our check, we saw a total of $10.86 (for just the shoe rental) and thought they comped our bowling time (of approx 30 minutes) due to the mistake from before since it said $0 for that part. We were grateful. Then when we got our check, after giving our card, we saw a final charge of approx $40. We asked the server if this was the wrong charge and he said he gave us the wrong one earlier, which really sucks because we thought different. We asked for the new itemized bill that we charged for, in which the server can't find so they call their manager over. While we're talking to the manager the server then brings over another receipt asking if this was the name on the card. We go to our banking account and see they charged us twice of the $40 charge. The server comes over again and says they removed the first charge with no details of how much we actually paid, and then proceeds to take the checkbook without making sure we signed (which we didn't yet because we wanted to make sure we signed the right receipt with the correct charge). We were only given the paid receipt of the $40 charge. We ended up staying a little bit later again to just get clarification and one of the other managers, Sylvia, helped try to clear things up with us. She said both of the charges would be dropped. I don't know ya'll, the disorganization at the end of the night was very disappointing. We just wanted to leave on a good note. They should have a system where we can see a screen confirming the phone number we put down since the music is so loud. And I know it's closing time, but the servers really shouldn't be rushing to close tabs because it can cause errors like it did with us. We're unsure if we'd come back again."

We ordered a lot of food and finished almost all of it. They serve you steamed eggs and kimchi and a few other things on the house the moment you sit down. We ordered their Korean pancakes and wings for the appetizer and both were excellent! For the main course we offered their beef bulgogi, seafood soon tofu, cheeses fried rice, beef soon tofu, and fried rice. Everything tasted amazing, so much so that I have been craving for some Korean food ever since. We ordered their 3 different flavors of mocho ice cream, which they displayed it so beautifully with fresh strawberries and oranges. I didn't even like mocho ice cream before this and now I love it.I think the lady serving us was the owner of the restaurant. She was very pleasant and was always smiling and would fold her hands and bow down every time we compliment the meal or told her how great she is at her job. It is a decent size restaurant and was quite busy when we went. They keep the place very clean and their bowls and plates were nice, clean and hot."

This place was packed and seemed to only have one server but, my party was seated promptly. Food: 4.5 / 5We order the beef Kabli + Seafood Tofu soup combo with an order of soy garlic chicken legs. I will admit the chicken legs were definitely my favorite part as it SUPER crispy. Sadly, we did not understand that  they offer you gloves not wipes so we were a lost cause at the first leg. We spent about ~$60 after tip. So definitely not the most expensive place to eat!Service/Ambiance: 4/5This place is really causal and you can see they have regulars from families to solo diners. Due to their limited staff, it took longer then I would have liked to  bring a waitress to my table and order. They have at least two busyboys (who also seem to deliver food to the tables?) on the floors but, we had a challenge communicating with them as well. All in all, not a bad experience but know what you want.     All in all, I would go back but I would probably just get the tofu soup if I come here solo. The chicken is nice if you have a large crowd. I really enjoyed the banchan and the free steamed egg."

But we don't have to wait for long.We ordered Seafood and Scallion Pancake, Beef Tofu Soup, Bulgogi, and God Damn Spicy Fried Chicken.The side dishes were really good. And they also gave us free steam egg. The food was absolutely amazing. My mom love the fried chicken as the meat was very tender and juicy. The sauce was phenomenal. For the bulgogi, you should choose the spicy version. It was not too spicy and it paired perfectly well with the rice. The Beef Tofu Soup was pretty small. But it tasted amazing and we kept digging in.The manager/ server was very friendly and attentive. Eventhough the food took a long time to prepare, the server kept on check up on us and apologize for the wait. But as the food was amazing and the server was great, we had no complaint at all.The ambiance was cozy and lively. It was overall a nice experience. We will come back here again."

The shells were removed from the clams (a thoughtful touch) and the tofu was so soft. I also enjoyed the side dishes and thought it was great that they included steamed eggs. I shared their honey soy garlic chicken with my friend, which was tasty. In addition, the service is good and I truly have nothing but positive things to say about this place."
2300,vWoT1h8E2eWvIdJqpuxfdg,3/26/2023,4 star rating,"Really tasty Korean food and fast service. Tofu Tofu is kind of hidden, tucked under some scaffolding and an unmarked door. The inside of the restaurant was small but clean and cute enough for a casual date. I ordered the tofu hot stone bowl and it was enough for dinner and some light leftovers. I like to let my bowl sit and cook for a bit longer so after 4-5 min the rice was super crispy. The spicy sauce was definitely needed to add some depth of flavor. The dish came with some banchan, including kimchi that wasn't very spicy, fish cakes, and vegetables. I didn't love the macaroni salad, it had little flavor. They also gave us a steamed egg on the house, which was super light and fluffy. They refilled everything except the steamed egg. I would come back, but the prices were a little high and what I would expect uptown, not in Chinatown."

From soondobu, to kalbi, chicken wings; just everything. Combos are my go to, though. The portions are enough to be shared at reasonable prices. Ajumma is incredibly kind, and soft spoken. She always greet you with the most gentle smile. A trek from Brooklyn even just for a quick bite is totally worth it."
2302,vWoT1h8E2eWvIdJqpuxfdg,1/27/2023,5 star rating,"They really need to rename Tofu Tofu into Banchan Banchan because their free sides are really really good! Prepare for a slight wait on weekend nights, as the place can get pretty packed. There were a few parties ahead of us, but it moved pretty quick and we were seated within a few minutes. After ordering the spicy pork kimchi combo, which comes with rice and your choice of soondubu, the Banchan came nearly instantly, which came with ""complementary"" steamed egg (no refills on that!) The kimchi from the Banchan was terrific, and had a slight sweet flavor without an overly spicy finish. Almost makes me almost regret getting a dish that had kimchi and fish tofu already, since those come free and unlimited with the Banchan. The soondubu came piping hot, and I'd recommend starting with your meat dish and rice to let it cool down a little. The tofu soup also had smooth, slightly runny yolk throughout, which was a nice touch. Overall, it's a better and slightly cheaper experience than your typical BCD affair, so it's a great way to get that tofu soup fix!"

They were the perfect comfort meal. The tofu stew is super flavorful, came out fresh and hot and also comes with a bowl of steaming rice! The bulgogi was also super tasty and was a good portion size. The restaurant also provides complimentary banchan with your meal such as kimchi, fishcake, pickled cucumbers, macaroni salad, etc. The staff was super attentive and so kind throughout our meal. Honestly I'd say it's a 10/10 just based on the service alone! They even refilled our banchan once we finished them which we appreciated. Definitely will come back to try other dishes on the menu. If you're craving authentic Korean food I highly recommend this spot!"

I always come out with a full belly ;) from the banchan, complimentary steamed egg, to the main dishes and shareable dishes.Need suggestions on what to order? Say less! You definitely need to try their Korean Fried Chicken!! They also have them in their sister restaurant TADA Korean Fried Chicken, which is about a 5 minute walk from Tofu Tofu. Stop by both of these places in Chinatown if you're ever around, you won't regret it."

The food wasn't really to my liking, I wouldn't visit again. The food just didn't taste like what I expected, or like what it usually taste like in different restaurants with the same dish. I don't really know how to explain it, but it just was not that good. I had left overs and didn't even want to take it to go. The best dish was probably the bulgogi combo, you can't really go wrong with some stir fried bulgogi and rice.The staff was kind, but the food was not up to par. The food did come out super quick and come with an assortment of ban chans. I noticed most people ordered the Korean fried chicken here, so maybe that's what they are good at making. But the other foods just weren't it. Tl;dr - food was disappointing, saw a lot of people get the Korean fried chicken, maybe that's what's good here?"

Pretty big and a great value, this pizza is perfect for a late night bite. The pizza is always fresh because there is a lot of demand and the classic flop seals the deal.Barstool gave this a 5.9??

I don't eat meat so I had the impossible burger which I am having mixed feelings not sure what it was the taste at first was good however the after taste it's tricky and I eat good so I know the service was amazing the cashier had phenomenal customer skills the ambiance was a bit dull there was an excessive amount of flies the floor was highly dirty the tables as well I get the whole reddish lightning system but it was not my cup of tea it was a quick bite for the night and it was not pleasing my children left food and that usually does not happen but ok I guess everyone's different I won't recommend on my end sorry
2318,0on-dzMpBki-qDa18pjF5A,7/12/2022,5 star rating,A nice burger place with really nice staff. I saw the great reviews about this place and had to try it. They've got plenty of seating before heading to the register and the staff was nice and courteous. The burger and fries combos are reasonably priced. I did enjoy their chipotle mayo. Make sure to ask for that separately :).Their fries were pretty good + are a very generous portion and overall a great stop for a burger bite. Their burgers are a bit small so you may have to order two.They do have a bathroom in the back just make sure to ask them for the key!
2319,0on-dzMpBki-qDa18pjF5A,12/4/2022,2 star rating,Their burgers are tiny. I spent 16 dollars for a one patty burger and fries. Five guys is way better for the same price and you'd get an extra patty and better quality fries. The burger bun could hardly contain the meat. The fries were crinkle cut and we're very lackluster especially for the price of 5.50.  would not get again.

Clean/bright interior with a simple menu to the right wall.Wasn't in the mood for a burger, so ordered the Chicken Sandwich ($8.50) and the Chocolate Chip Cookie Shake ($6.75). Pricing is pretty good here and food came out after a few minutes. Shake is large and fairly thick, solid amount of chocolate flavor (not so much the cookie). Chicken sandwich wasn't great, chicken tasted overcooked, and the rest of the sandwich didn't detract enough to help. Nonetheless, fine enough to eat with some ketchup.Glad it was open; probably should stick with the burgers."

2327,AoezuAP-QOH6JZZOmyzJLg,11/28/2022,3 star rating,"If i could give 3.5 stars I would. We chose this place because it sold pizza by the slice, had salads and was on the upper east side.We ordered 3 cheese slices, the sautéed broccoli, the arugula salad and the sautéed spinach. There were three of us. One of the veggie sides would have been plenty so this was absolute stuff your face ridiculous. This pizza is very average. It is very easy to find far better pizza by the slice in NY. The veggie sides were all pretty tasty. I would go for the vegetables but not for this pizza. Sauce was pretty plain, cheese was bland and not gooey enough. Crust was good."
2328,AoezuAP-QOH6JZZOmyzJLg,3/16/2023,1 star rating,Attended an event at nearby 92Y and read the raving reviews but so disappointed with the plain slice!  Even some $1 places tasted much better. Their crust is thin which is typically what I like but their pizza lacks any taste of a decent pizza where the sauce is bland and the dough coming off the cheese and marinara sauce is doughy. Makes me wonder whether this neighborhood knows what good NYC pizza tastes like. Genuine good NYC pizza is like Joe's pizza on 14th and 3rd Ave.
2329,AoezuAP-QOH6JZZOmyzJLg,12/23/2022,4 star rating,My go to pizza place in the upper east side. Delicious pizza by the slice! There's some seating area inside. I mostly take it out to go. Friendly staff too.
2330,AoezuAP-QOH6JZZOmyzJLg,12/19/2021,5 star rating,This pizza is incredible!!! They have a ton of selections of both square (Sicilian) and NY style pizza. My personal favorite is the spicy pepperoni stuffed crust Sicilian slice. Another favorite is the MVP (Margherita/vodka/pesto) Sicilian slice. Any of the NY style slices are solid. Service is pretty quick and they're super friendly. They'll give you a box for all of your to-go slices. There is also a decently sized area to sit and enjoy your pizza. I personally like to eat mine in bed
2331,AoezuAP-QOH6JZZOmyzJLg,11/14/2022,3 star rating,"Marinara Pizza was a quick and convenient stop for a slice before an event at the very nearby 92nd Street Y. However, a plain cheese slice was a steep $4. Other pizzas looked intriguing, like a salad pizza, but I was nervous to ask what they cost. The cashier was more on the aloof side but the guy handing over the slices was friendlier. The plain slices weren't bad though they could've been warmed up for a little longer. Nice crunchy crust. Seating available both inside and outside."

2333,AoezuAP-QOH6JZZOmyzJLg,12/23/2022,2 star rating,"Got delivery from Marinara's a couple days ago for lunch. I ordered the homemade mozzarella sticks and a small cheese pizza- extra crispy. I ordered for a delivery at 12:45pm but my food didn't even leave the restaurant until 1:20pm. Whether that's an issue with Grubhub or Marinara I couldn't tell you but I do know that my food didn't hit the hands of a delivery driver until over 30 minutes past when it should've been in my hands. The mozz sticks were actually pretty great! (after I heated them up because they came to me ice cold) They came with a marinara and vodka sauces. The sauces were tasty as well.The pizza however... I'm not sure the cooks at Marinara have heard of yeast in a pizza dough. Whether this was an anomaly of a dough that didn't rise or this is what they want their product to look like is unclear. I mean I was surprised and a little confused that they decided to buy oversized shells from Taco Bell's Mexican pizza for their crusts but who am I to question the Italian authorities at Marinara Pizza. Maybe the culinary minds at this pizza place thought that since New York-style pizza is known for having a thin crust, it might be a competition to see who could produce the thinnest crust. They would certainly be hoisting that trophy with no deliberation needed from the judges. Marinara is a very special place to me in NYC, mostly because there's never been a pizzeria in this city that would make me prefer the frozen works of the Chefs DiGiorgno or Tombstone over a fresh pizza but they've somehow cleared that bar. Marinara Pizza: Go for the mozzarella sticks; don't stay for the pizza."
2334,AoezuAP-QOH6JZZOmyzJLg,2/1/2023,2 star rating,"Pizza is mediocre, and quite expensive for what it is.  Minimal sauce, sparse toppings, and if you order delivery it will take an hour plus.  Definitely better going in person.  However, the mozz sticks and chicken parm sandwich are damn good."

I saw the chicken caesar salad slice and it stuck out to me. Unique pizza but it worked and the salad didn't get the crust soggy.  You could also tell it was made fresh. I also tried the tricolor sauce square slice with pesto, vodka sauce, and marinara. It was thin and crispy. I scarfed it down so fast I was close to getting another one. Only knock was it was a little hot in there to sit and eat. Solid pizza. Got it at 4 stars."

2341,vHBKc-ka_goJPxtHt8Zcvw,5/30/2022,2 star rating,"So I wanted to go to one of the historic lesbian bars of NYC and get to experience going to a queer bar for the first time. Although the bartender was respectful, it seems that there is a negative bias towards non-white patrons as one reviewer mentioned. The bartender was more talkative and engaging with the white patrons compared to me (and it made things more awkward being the only Black person in the bar). The space is small and can get crowded, so it can be a health concern with COVID. Plus, the outside seating at the time wasn't available. Positives: Drinks were pretty cheap, and two bathrooms available.If you're a BIPOC, I wouldn't really recommend going here unless you got your friends with you. It's a shame, really since I am aware of the lesbian bars being closed down and disappearing. But if you're not gonna make queer BIPOC, who contribute much to the LGBTQIA+ community with activism, culture, etc. and still face discrimination in the community, welcome then why bother having a queer bar?"

I'm 22 and get carded every time, and all the clubs we've  been to I've been fine getting in, because they have proper equipment and black lights to verify ID.At this bar, there was a woman my age checking IDs by just looking at them. She had no equipment to check, and told me my ID was fake. I even presented her my credit cards and my vax record with my birthday on it (there is no way you can fake this by logging on to the official California vax site) and she would not let me in and was extremely condescending.I completely understand keeping those out with fake IDs, but being over 21 and having an issue at only this place when every other place I've been to has been great with bouncers says something! It's unfortunate that I experienced this, perhaps because I am short or perhaps because I am from California, or maybe because I am brown. My two forms of ID were not enough here, and I will never be returning. Being POC definitely factored into the condescending tone of the bouncer."

NYC has some local pizzerias that seem average at a glance but which actually serve excellent food. Dante's Pizza is clearly one of them."

Guys working here were courteous and efficient. Sauce is a bit sweeter like others have mentioned. Pie is a nice size, but $30 was a bit steep based off competition in the area and location. Definitely good, but will be less frequently visiting because Austin and Ascsan have the same sort of quality for roughly $21-$24 for the same kind of pie."

The chicken tasted reasonably fresh, which is something that doesn't always happen with delivery. Sausage roll: about what you'd expect. I didn't order a pizza, but I did notice that their menu tells you exactly how large their pizzas are, which is something that a surprising number of pizza places can't seem to do."

Came here immediately after to get the kind of slice I was hoping for and it sort of did the trick.Let me be straight, this is not a destination for pizza that you travel for. However, for a neighbor joint in Forest Hills, it will have to do. The crust was crispy albeit a bit thick. The sauce was pretty tasty and there was plenty of cheese. I think Lillian's had the best plain slice in our area, maybe a bit too oily, but had consistently produced delicious pizza. Since ownership change, it's not what it was imo. Unfortunately, beggars can't be choosers. Forest Hills just does not have any more great pizzerias."

Not one employee here is wearing a mask. You can see the guy making a pizza in the front, no mask. Guy working in the back in the kitchen, no mask. This is honestly disgusting and I won't be back. They also let people in off the street without masks on. This behavior is why we'll never be out of this pandemic"

2356,CneFQFfg8leJrgMqsleUUQ,12/10/2022,4 star rating,"I really like Lenwich! I used to work right around Madison Square park and would get the salads/sandwiches quite often. I went more recently (many years later) and still loved the chicken Caesar wrap. I was surprised that at no extra cost, they give you extra dressing on the side. Two things I'd say; 1- expect to pay a lot (in my opinion) for a pretty simple sandwich or wrap. This is NYC and you are in the middle of lots of things 2- it is probably easiest to order online if you are able. This will cut your wait time down tremendously and make your experience even more enjoyable. If you do not do this, you end up ordering in one place, paying in another and then waiting a bit for your order."
2357,CneFQFfg8leJrgMqsleUUQ,11/25/2022,4 star rating,"Lenwich is an excellent spot for all kinds of subs, sandwiches, coffee, tea, bakery and breakfast items. They have some really unique sandwiches. To order, you need to go to the counter all way at the back, then pay and pick it up at the counter in front. There's a small seating area in front of the store.I got the Lenwich (pastrami) sandwich. It was very tasty, the warm pastrami went well with toasted white bread. I got a free spicy Korean sauce sample that made the sandwich even better. Sandwiches take about 5-10 minutes to get ready, could be longer during busy hours. They do not accept DISCOVER credit card and don't allow taking pictures inside :(, FYI."

2366,qSb2eTx5vA54jcYIwKLZAA,7/22/2015,3 star rating,"I have never really liked KFC, but with things like UFC (Unidentified Flying Chicken) and Kennedy Fried Chicken near by, I decided to slowly try out all three stores. Honestly, as unbelievable as this sounds, my experience with KFC was not that bad.I went into the store and it was slightly sticky and humid given that it was a hot summer day. I pondered over the menu for a bit and ultimately decided on the chicken tenders $5 fill up meal; there were other $5 fill ups available such as chicken breast. My meal came with a medium drink, wedge fries, three long and crispy chicken tenders, a cookie, and a biscuit. I asked for the special KFC sauce and barbecue sauce. The food came out pretty fast.I first began with the biscuit, as I wanted to get that out of the way. The biscuit was slightly hard and I could tell it wasn't very fresh. Additionally, the biscuit did not have much flavor so I ended up dipping it in sauce. I then began to eat the tenders which looked like extremely long and obese fries. The tenders surprisingly tasted pretty good. The fried breaded outer skin was somewhat crispy. The chicken taste was well complemented by the KFC special sauce that kind of looked like and tasted like the southwest chipotle sauce at Subways. The tenders was somewhat filling. The fries were kind of soggy, but they were very filling. I saved my cookie for later, as I was pretty full. I was mildly entertained while enjoying my meal as there was a pair of coworkers, at the next table, talking about internet security and Spanish TV playing. The internet security talk was fairly interesting, but I mostly paid attention to the Spanish TV show. Interestingly enough, I did not understand a word of it, but I could tell that it was pretty funny. However, what was not entertaining was the irritating fly that decided it wanted to test the limits of its annoyance before being killed. KFC wasn't very sanitary, but the food, besides the biscuit, was decent."

They're also way too big. I wish they were half the size that they are.The employee was courteous.The hot wings are hot but the chicken is salty. The chicken breast was bland & soggy underneath the skin even though we ordered crispy."
2368,qSb2eTx5vA54jcYIwKLZAA,8/31/2021,1 star rating,"Standard good KFC food, just be careful if ordering close to their 11pm closing time. Minimum wage workers will start closing 10-15 minutes earlier to go home on time clock watchers, so if you order e.g. at 10.50 pm, the computer will accept the order (as they're still formally open) , but will go unfilled even if you send Door Dash to pick it up. Do not place order after 10:30 pm as if Door Dash driver is a bit late due the crazy traffic, etc, they will lock KFCs door and not give the food to Door Dash driver and will cancel your order, so careful about your late evening orders."

The size of the chicken is tiny , it is about the size of the bread !!! Does KFC have quality control ? NO NO No they don't do the chicken right !!!!!"

After ordering and at check out I told the Carolina of how we just had a bad experience at the other KFC and thank her for being so kind and even smile even before I told her what happen to us. Very nice place actually on point and nice and friendly staff. FOOD WAS GREAT NICE AND WARM. The best part no attitude..... Thank God their still nice people and places out there.

With the exception of one item , I'm lactose intolerant so I didn't care for the Mac and cheese but as they dug into it they found a hair that was non of ours . I don't want this to affect people from eating KFC , it's amazing and they greeted me well . I just won't want another customer having the same experience and probably not taking it the lightly .

The 3 of us started with a burrata and tomato & also a Calamari starter. Both delicious, but I'd say don't pass up the Calamari as it was fantastic. So tender, hot and crispy... probably the best I've ever had eaten.My cousin and I decided to share a steak (my husband opting for his own) and we ordered two sides. In all honesty my husband's steak was so huge we could have probably shared it three ways as he brought a fair portion home. We even had a little of ours to bring home too. Very delicious, tender and luscious with those whipped mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. We barely had room, but since it was my husband's and mine 25th wedding anniversary we did get dessert, a chocolate mousse cake again three forks please! A elegant meal with delicious food, I enjoyed having someone else serving steak to me table side."

The bartender was knowledgeable and took his time to make sure we all had what we wanted. Being with a work group of 6 we requested a round table and were given a nice one in the corner. Our server was patient and made a lot of excellent reservations. Despite the already fabulous menu they also had quite a good number of specials to chose from. We opted for the magnum of wine on the table to share and a few starters. The tomato/Buffalo mozzarella salad special and the tuna tartare. Both were fair portions and extremely fresh and flavorful. We heard the speciality pasta (rigatoni with sausage and broccoli rabe) was excellent so we had that and lobster Mac n cheese as our next course. Both DELICIOUS. We shared two filets, a ribeye and the special snapper as our mains between the 6 of us. The steak was very flavorful and pre sliced which was a nice touch. We didn't have much room left, but ended up trying a good selection of dessert as well. The cheesecake, Apple strudel and tiramisu were all SO GOOD. Overall this was a wonderful meal, everything was tasty, fairly priced and really good service."

I have been dying to come back because my first visit was amazing.The restaurant has outdoor seating available right now. They have a bright red awning in front so it really stands out. The outside has a bright red gate. The Spain flag is hanging. It's on the lower level of like a brown stone type building so you do have to walk down a few a steps, not too many. The restaurant looks exactly the same as my last visit. Bar to the left which has a wall dividing the seating area. To the right there's multiple squared tables. Smaller tables towards the front, bigger tables towards the back. The tables had a vase and flower in the center. The brick walls and concrete ceiling add such a unique touch to the restaurant. I ordered from the lunch section of the menu. The prices are reasonable especially with the ridiculous food costs lately. I ordered the bistec with boiled potato. The lunch items come with a house salad that is already seasoned with vinegar, oil, salt. I asked for the steak to be cooked to medium temp. It was perfectly cooked and came with a ton of onions on top. The potato is simply boiled. I think both the potato and steak could of used more salt BUT it was so good and i ate it without asking for salt. The service was 2 on 1. It was perfect. My friend and i were the only two people in the restaurant. The waiter was friendly, quick and attentive. I cannot wait to be back. Maybe next time I'll try a different item."

I'd be embarrassed serving this let alone charging people. Btw gentleman waiter was very nice, female server has a horrible attitude and looks like she doesn't want to be there.

If you're in the mood to shop for new Nikes and get a bite to eat then Ovi's is your place.  I've eaten here numerous times and decided to order food to go as I was visiting my mom.Ovi's offers a variety of options from pressed juices, smoothies, salads and platters. The platters range from 1/4 chicken and one side: fried plantains, tostones, black beans and rice etc for $8.99 or 1/2 chicken with a side for $11.99 and more options. I ordered two 1/2 chicken platters with a side of tostones and side of fried plantains. The order also came with a side of spicy green sauce and red onions. I also ordered a small pressed juice with spinach, ginger and apples. A bargain for $3.19.Well is Ovi's the place? Not exactly...The chicken was tasty but dry thus the green sauce added a needed kick. The tostones were a bit hard and the onions were picante. The real star were the fried plantains or platanos maduros: they were sweet, mushy  and tasted like caramel. As for the pressed juice: ginger overload.Here's the other disconnect: upon checkout I showed the owner(?) the 10% promo off order upon Yelp checkin. He stated he doesn't honor it and didn't know that Ovi's was under Yelp. Additionally, he stated the pic Yelp used it's not Ovi's. I showed him the address listed under Ovi's and it was 2925 Avenue H. He stated still not this place. I guess the $2.90 that I would have saved might break Ovi's piggy bank.So, Yelp, Ovi's doesn't need your help with brand recognition thus you might want to remove it?Just sayin..."

Spicy cabbage nice and tart and packing a decent amount of heat. This side is a nice counterpoint to the more subdued flavors of the chicken. The little vinegary hot sauce you get is also perfect for any grilled dish IMO. Try to weasel an extra if you go. You'll use it. I had a custom juice of apple, carrot, parsley, ginger (hot.) it was fresh and delicious. Service was cheerful, helpful and professional. They packed everything to go very carefully by wrapping all leak prone items  tightly in plastic wrap Before bagging. I'm so glad this place is still here."

Their salad is expensive it's like $13 with chicken but it's pretty fresh and good. sometimes I get a toasted croissant with egg and cheese and a turkey panini. I don't particularly like their pre-made hot meals and today I ordered the chef salad with ham and turkey and didn't like it. Salads are best when you make them yourself versus premade menu. A plus tho is that Brooklyn college students get a discount.

Now I know how the SHEIN workers feel when they pack my orders. Someone should call the Department of Health on this place. Fans everywhere and the temp was at 84 degrees but felt more like 105. I only gave 2 stars because the food was good but I could never come back due to temperature control. Avoid this place like the plague."

I fell in love with this restaurant that I came in three weeks in a row because I was craving for it. The staff members that work here are super nice and when I talked to one of the workers, they said that they have live music every wednesdays. The food is slightly pricey especially the chips and guacamole that is going for $10. Other than that I recommend everyone to come and try it out."
2409,h_txIS455l7FR-UXN-LfpA,5/26/2022,4 star rating,Awesome place. Very friendly staff and the coconut mojitos are simply amazing.. food was ok we had wings which were pretty good. Guacamole and chips i didn't like as much i felt the guacamole had a bitter taste to it. El pastor tacos were good.

2412,h_txIS455l7FR-UXN-LfpA,10/22/2021,1 star rating,Avoid this place at all cost. The waitress had no idea what liquor was in their mixed drink options. The enchilada was chunks of unseasoned grilled chicken rolled in a corn tortilla with some sauce on it and topped with hardest avocado slices I've ever eaten and no flavor whatsoever; I could've made this better at home. The shrimp cocktail was extremely tangy and sour. The queso was a bowl of melted cheese. The only positive part of this experience was that my beer tasted fine.

The food was packaged well for take out, except the fries which came home soggy. They need to poke holes in the little plastic lids. No biggie. When we ate there the service was friendly and unhurried. So, we felt welcome. We got the queso fundido (no meat) and I had the vegetarian tacos. Hubby got the milanesa sammy. Everything was tasty. They didn't have tres leches but they had what we (USSR folk) call sour cream cake. It was nummy. We will be ordering from here again and occasionally leaving our couch to eat there."

Whether it is pregaming before a night out in the city, coming in for a nightcap after a night out or just kicking back after work and playing some darts, this place is perfect. Cheap drinks, buybacks and great bartenders (shoutout to Mike) who remember your favorite drinks after a few visits.And don't forget the jukebox ..the place has a cool laid back non-judgemental type of vibe where you could be listening to hardcore rap one minute, then Nirvana the next and then Justin Bieber.

2422,do_ndggWB4Gb56rP6ikbVw,10/12/2018,4 star rating,Pleasantly surprised with the Irish Rover. I've passed this place a bunch of times and it always struck me as a dive to not go into. I think my buddy told me that this was like the first place he ever had a drink when he was way younger. But same person I was cat sitting at him and his wife's place down the block the other weekend. I wanted to watch the Lions on Sunday. Usually this becomes a huge ordeal for me in New York. I thought about the Local because I like their beer menu but I don't think they have too many tvs. Decided to give this a shot. Asked the bartender that was Irish if he could turn on the game and he asked which tv! Oh happy day. Typically the reaction I get is either 'get out of my bar'. Or if it's a female she will scrunch up her face and ask who the Lions are and 'ohhhh . . . . good heavens no we can't do that'. They have a bunch of tvs though and are pretty great with distributing whatever and saving the big screen for your precious giants or jets. Beers were cheap-ish and around $4-5. A few craft beers in addition to your typical finds. Everyone here was super friendly and laid back enough that random strangers would share your table with you. It was never at any point too crowded which is a miracle and godsend. You can also bring in outside food since they don't have a kitchen.

Come in groups or or come for an intimate drink either way I'm sure it will be fun..chill bartenders and cheap pitchers ... Count me in."

The dumplings are amazing, organic, fresh, light, and just so delicious!I feel like I'm eating old family recipes that are so delicious and healthy that they can't help but stand out. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The ginger rice is heavenly, and the dumplings are amazing and packed with flavor. Try the 3-cup chicken, scallion pancake, or the dumpling special. So creative! I love every new addition to the menu."
2427,2eR8ftw-GiTEwg3Y7Rm-MA,2/9/2023,2 star rating,"I really am sad that I didn't like this. I might return in the future to try their ordinary dumplings but I do think as someone who grew up eating dumplings this is quite the case of fusion confusion.Got the January special which were the chicken and waffle dumplings. I will praise them for the actual dumpling itself - nicely fried, crispy, and a dense heaping of juicy chicken meat inside. It makes it a little more justified that it was like 17 bucks for four dumplings (and two scallion waffles). The waffles were just ok, a little soggy, not crispy, and not a strong scallion flavor either. An interesting combo of flavors but not that enjoyable tbh. Spicy Dan Dan noodles - love a dan dan noodle. Just so you know it's made with soba noodles which gives a different texture and flavor being that they're made from buckwheat. However they lacked the things I enjoy from dan dan noodles - bits of pork meat in a nice spicy tangy sauce that clings to the noodles. Just underwhelming and very heavy on the soba flavor with a very mild spice level."

I get a Westernized vibe from the place, and the dumplings are more expensive than I would normally want to pay, but they are tasty. There's a counter at the front where you order and pay; no complaints about the service. The portion sizes are on the smaller side, so don't expect to get full off them. Overall: the dumplings taste good and I liked eating them, but this is not where I would look to go for dumplings."
2429,2eR8ftw-GiTEwg3Y7Rm-MA,2/22/2023,4 star rating,"Multiple locations, great place for Dim Sum and Taiwainese cuisine, although not completely authentic, it was a great sit down for lunch. Food was served almost immediately and you can see the dumplings being freshly made. We started with the Dan Dan noodles which they claimed were very spicy, however if you can handle the heat, it was not as spicy as expected. We actually ordered extra red chili oil for some added flavor and kick. They were made out of buckwheat soba served with fresh baby Bok choy. We ordered the chicken dumplings along with pork chives dumplings. You can choose from fried or boiled and we choose the fried as we like the extra crunch from the sear. Dumplings were served with a tangy, vinegar sauce. Not many drink selections. Recommended Dishes: Spicy Dan Dan Noodles, Hot Fried Chicken Dumplings, Pork and Chives Dumplings"

The dumplings are deliciously fresh, you can see them literally making it in front of you while you wait.The signature Mimi Cheng dumplings with chicken are my favorite, but the pork and chive ones are also very good and have a unique triangular shape. The dan dan noodles are excellent as well, although it does have a little bit of kick so avoid if you're very sensitive to spice. Prices are a little on the high side at $15 for 8 dumplings."
2431,2eR8ftw-GiTEwg3Y7Rm-MA,3/15/2023,5 star rating,Hearty Taiwanese food with dumplings and noddles that make for a great option as a semi-quick lunch. FYI: Dan Dan dish with garlic chili oil is a hit. $12 a dish. 4.25/5 stars as a lunch spot.

No scallions nothing else! Unless their other items are better, I would avoid Mimi Cheng's Dumplings. If you are craving noodles and willing to substitue Thai, I iwould recommend Sala Thai  about four doors down on Amsterdam. The positive + the service was very good and fast."

Upon coming met this beautiful soft spoken lady Denise( manager)  she  heard our concern and received us and seated us. She reached out to Kimberly to let her know we were on the premises.I expressed to Denise(manager) she is so respectful and so sweet and very professional. I was happy to know I didn't need to come back and  they honored us.  The staff on the premises we're very accommodating. My hubby was happy with his steak and eggs. Denise and Kimberly thank you so much. Suggestions: The owner of this business needs to do right by his staff and the other staff members need to listen to the managers so they will succeed in the future.

There's always so many people inside and we always get lucky in finding a table. It is a really good thing that this location has plenty of seating. There isn't much to say about ihop since everytime I come it's always consistent. What I love about breakfast food is the homefries. If there is no homefries, my eggs with bacon/sausage is not complete. I can always rely on ihop as their homefries are super crispy and delicious. The sausage is on the smaller side and it would be nice if they give a bigger portion of meat especially with the prices that high. It is around the same price as local diner restaurants but the restaurants give a much bigger portion than what this place gives."

Whatever, we didn't really care, it's iHop whatever. The worst part comes when we had to pay; our waitress gave us the check coming out around $96, we paid, giving her around $10 tip. When we were leaving she came over and asked ""did i do anything wrong for a $2 tip?"" Us being confused looked at each other, knowing we put in more then that. She shows us the recipe; showing the total was $101. Again we're confused on why is our total completely different. She then goes ""Listen, I'm grateful and all but i don't know, you can even have your tip back."" We didn't take it, however...I don't know what to say, me and my friends felt confused leaving the place, even felt looked down upon from the way the waitress dealt and spoke to us."

My recent experience with ordering egg sandwiches is that they have been flavorless.  I don't know how someone manages that - but it's been happening constantly.  The sandwich I picked up from this place was the exact opposite with the taste of the Swiss being clear and the sausage adding a perfect compliant.  I am just so happy to have found this place. Take note - this is purely a take out space.  There is no place to sit - and as the name implies, it's primarily a coffee joint (and I personally don't drink coffee) but despite this - if they can make an egg sandwich like the one I had today on a repeat basis, I'll definitely be back for more!"

The space is small but people used to sit inside. Too tiny a space for me. I still need to try the coffee and other offerings. The menu looks good! I'll be back!

The restaurant was clean and comfortable, with colorful decorations and soothing music. The prices were marginally pricey, but great for the quality and quantity of food. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a tasty and satisfying vegetarian meal in New York."
2467,qhXIW0LDT4XsoN2IE6dZHg,1/15/2023,5 star rating,"I got delivery from Ahimsa and it was delicious!!! I LOVE that they have so many clearly labeled vegan options. The Masala Dosa was very good- of course with delivery there is only so much you can do to keep the texture the same as it would be served fresh in the restaurant. Serving was large and definitely enough for two people. I ate half the 2nd day, air fried, and it was really good as well. Great flavor and love the potato fillingI also got the Tofu Kofta- WOW!! Delicious. This has to be one of my favorite Indian dishes I've had. Flavor of the curry is so good- creamy & flavorful, but not too ""heavy"". Love the tofu kofta balls as well. I will definitely get this dish again. I will definitely order again from Ahimsa or try to go in person!! Delicious :)"
2468,qhXIW0LDT4XsoN2IE6dZHg,1/4/2023,5 star rating,"I'm so happy to have found somewhere that accommodates Jain people's particular food restrictions. My parents and I came to this restaurant and were so pleasantly surprised by the beautiful interior. There was a full-blown Jain menu that offered a variety of North/South Indian food that could be made without onion/garlic/root vegetables, and it was arguably just as good if not better than the regular menu. Gobi manchurian - a bit oily, chewy, wasn't my favorite of what we tried but still a solid optionPlain naan - sooo good! Wasn't overly thick or doughy - just right!Chana masala - really similar to homemade, which is why I liked itBhindi masala - my favorite, super flavorful and cooked through properlyPalak paneer - Another hit!All the food was really consistent. If you'd like the dishes to be spicy, make sure to specify that because they keep all the dishes on the mild side. As we were there the place was buzzing with people - they even said they could deliver outside their regular area if needed. Their customer service was wonderful, but it did take them a minute for the food to come out. It was worth the wait! Thoroughly recommend if you're around Murray Hill!"

I was originally going to the restaurant that used to be in this location, which was the much-loved Sons of Thunder, for a yummy, fresh poke bowl, but that is how I learned that SOT had sadly closed, and NOW AT 204 East 38th is Ahimsa, a lovely Indian restaurant , and after reading Yelp reviews, and seeing PHOTOS, I took the plunge and went inside for lunch. MY LUNCH WAS DELISH!!!  See my photos and my check-in, too. I asked the server if there were any lunch specials. Today is Thursday, (a weekday) and the server said ""The Chef's Selection Lunch Special"", ($14.99), which consisted of spinach/potato, chickpeas in yummy sauce, rice, Mung salad, and a piece of warm Naan bread. EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS !!!  Please see my photos.  I appreciated the tray the food was served in because it had individual sections and the portion size was no-guilt portion size, meaning it was filling, yet not a feeling of eating too much. PERFECT!!!  And DELICIOUS !! Next time, I shall have to try dessert!  I have my eye in the rice pudding.  This location is close to NYU MEDICAL OFFICES, as well as NYU's RUSK INSTITUTE. The skylight is still there. I always loved it. And the decor and atmosphere is calming and civilized.  I had meant to take more photos of the pretty artwork, but you can see some of it in my photos.  Enjoy!  I definitely recommend Ahimsa Indian Restaurant !"

While maintaining a traditional menu, they also incorporate elegant modern elements such as tofu options and vegan options. They specify the allergens as well! The food was bursting with flavor, spice, and heat. Make sure to let them know the spice level before ordering! My favorite item was the Gobi Manchurian, which was fried to perfection. The dishes tasted fresh, portions were perfect, and the vibe is like a calm suburban Indian restaurant with an elegant atmosphere. Will definitely be going back regularly!"

I wanted to get the piña colada flavor in their pineapple cup. Note that the sign they have up does not mean that the cup is free. It costs about a dollar more to get your drink in the pineapple cup. Which their wording makes is misleading. The service was great. They were able to answer my questions about yhe new flavors. I was very disappointed in the piña colada flavor as it didnt taste anything like it. It tasted more like water. It needed more flavor as it had non. The bubbles themselves were good and very chewy.

However, I opted for one of the new seasonal drinks (watermelon green tea) which means it's a bit harder to compare to your typical boba. The single employee at this spot was very friendly and efficient.I found the boba to have a wonderful texture, a bouncy chew. However, it lacked flavor altogether and I was simply chewing for fun. The tea was extremely sweet, but I opt for 25% usually, just wanted to try the default state with my first visit. In the future, with a more regular drink and reduced sugar, my experience may improve, but ultimately it was the boba as a topping that made my experience feel average.Additionally, the drink was on the pricier side compared to what I'm used to in Seattle and even then I think our drinks can be pricey. With that in mind, I wasn't too satisfied with paying $7-8 to chew boba as a pastime."

It was pretty good. I love the bubbles! I wouldn't get this one again personally. But it was good.I love that they package everything well and order is correct. Delivery quick. Prices aren't bad.

Today I tried the Gong Cha here in Times Square and I regret that choice.. $7 for a $5 drink that I ordered! Are you serious?  I was super polite, because this is a person possibly making your drink. But this chick really went out of her way to take advantage of a customer. Cheating herself out of her own tip by charging me for a different drink than I ordered..Not only did she overcharge me, she redid my order and gave me the same item on my bill a second time! I asked for 30% less sugar and got 0 sugar. I could see my order on the screen. I guess she is accustomed to doing this to unsuspecting tourist who will never return.... she only got it half right.

We picked this location because of the 3 course meals, and how close it is to broadway/time square. There was a blog with suggestions on places to go, and I am really happy we picked this one because our food and drinkers were amazing. Appetizers we got were the Crab Cake and Duck Wellington, entrees we got Lamb Bolognese and pork shank, and for dessert we got the apple bread pudding and some cappuccinos. The Food was actually some of the best I have ever had, which I really wasn't expecting for such a tourist area, but we picked the perfect meal. We got a few cocktails, but the blood orange martini was so amazing I ordered another. Everything we ate was delicious, but the last course of dessert, we requested it and it took them over 20 minutes before we were able to even spot our waiter to let him know we hadn't received it yet. The dessert was our only issue during our meal. The thing is, this place was recommended for before a Broadway show, and due to the delay on our dessert, we barely made it to the show - if they show hadn't been canceled we would have been late."
2487,DZ7oBcBdfe_1KxRxvFbsPQ,1/25/2023,4 star rating,Back again after long absence Jeremy too care of us.  Very nice.  Pleasant atmosphere and attentive service Enjoyed a kale salad with a white vinaigrette which gave the kale a little sweetness.  Cheese sprinkled and a slice of toasted French baguette. The salmon was very nicely prepared.  Crispy skin and cooked medium to medium rare. On a bed of cous cous and corn.  Enjoyable dish. The pasta was the fettuccine with shrimp in white wine sauce. Light dish packed with basil.  I tasted a shrimp and some pasta.  Strong but refreshing basil. Finished with the Panacota (sp.).  Which was cappuccino infused one.  Nice firm dessertI still recommend this place.
2488,DZ7oBcBdfe_1KxRxvFbsPQ,11/10/2022,5 star rating,"What a wonderful surprise of a restaurant! When one hears the word ""tavern"", there is usually an immediate assumption of sort of ""dive bar"" or wooden-paneled room situation. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THAT. THIS PLACE IS LOVELY. While it does have classic tavern seating (high top tables, long bar), it was really a beautiful aesthetic. You are greeted upon entry by their TWO lovely hostesses whom are hospitable and accommodating. I had a bite at the bar, and my bartender was amazing. Tall guy with locs - if I remember correctly his name is Sky - however he made a superb Sbagliato - not too much Sparkling Wine atop - just how I like it. Tried the beet salad - Delicious. Had the prosciutto board afterwards- HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Plus they carry Tia Maria - so your espresso martinis have a nice Jamaican spicy bite if you are to order one!What's awesome too - they are right in the middle of Broadway and always have availability. Pretty cool spot - I'll def be back."

Definitely request a window table upstairs or sit in the bar downstairs for the full experience.Plus: staff was so friendly! Our server was great, and the hostess was so adorable and wished us a happy anniversary multiple times! By far the best hostess we've encountered in NYC!"

I had the lamb bolognese which was delicious (kinda wish it had a little more lamb but still very good) We also had as a table some kind of goat cheese salad appetizer. The service was very attentive and overall a good experience. In the world of me going to NYC fairly often and trying different restaurants, this is one I'd return to again."

Quick friendly service, Christmas music was playing and great atmosphere. Drinks where great and reasonably priced. Pool table was out of order that night. But the bartender said will be back next week. Christmas decor was cosy and inviting. Leaving a review as I witnessed possibly the rudest group of girls who harassed the bartender for him asking them to leave as they where sitting at the bar for 20 minutes waiting for their Uber not ordering anything. Was appalled by their derogatory comments for him being Irish and not letting them sit and a busy bar and not ordering anything. Always two sides to every story hence me leaving a review as they mentioned on the way out ""he's getting a review"". Imagine going to an establishment and taking up seats and getting angry when asked to leave because you are not ordering drinks. Smh"

My friends often joke about this place because one in the group loves it, while I tend to hate it.It usually packed to the high heavens. The draft beer taste a bit off, I'm assuming the lines aren't cleaned that frequently. It's cheap, but your mixed drinks are light pours. It's more of a last resort bar."

This place sucks and I will not be returningHe literally sat on his phone online shopping then sat at the other end of the bar talking to a group of dudes.

Also, I've worked as a server and I realize that bartenders work very hard and aren't treated the best so I really try to give them the benefit of the doubt so often. But the bartender who worked tonight (Saturday night) was the biggest asshole I've encountered in a while. My friends and I were in there for a while and my friend was going up to the bar to get our drinks. At one point, I went up to just ask for a glass of tap water. The bar wasn't crowded and I did not interrupt the bartender getting a drink for anyone else. He refused to give me a glass of water saying water was only for ""paying costumers"". I was really confused because A. My friend had just been ordering and covering the drinks all night on his tab, but I had been drinking and planned to venmo him later, B. I had literally never had this sort of response when asking for a cup of water and C. I know that in nyc, restaurants and bars legally have to give you tap water if you ask so it shouldn't matter even if I wasn't a paying customer. When I responded just being like ""what? I don't understand"" and trying to explain my friend had been ordering me drinks, the bartender said ""oh so you're going to be a princess and get upset now"", and ""don't be a snowflake"". I didn't know anyone even still called anyone a snowflake in 2022, especially in nyc. When my (male) friend intervened because I was, in fact, getting upset at being yelled at, the bartender then did thrust a cup of water at me and said ""here princess, We have to pay our water bill but whatever."" Landlords are required to pay tenants' water bills in NYC but, again, whatever. Anyway, I guess I'm a snowflake because I left crying and it ruined my night. Just feels like even if I wasn't asking for a very reasonable thing that they are legally obligated to give, I shouldn't be called names?"

The owner looked like he was drunk and grabbed my friend from behind in an aggressive manner. When one of my friends jumped in and said that was unnecessary to put his hands on her he decided to kick us out. The security guard looked like this had happened before and said he had had listen to the owner because he owned the place. Grabbing someone from behind is unacceptable by all means.

But if you want a quick, homey meal in curry hill, this is the place.The combo platter (~$16 for 2 curries, rice and naan) is a STEAL. The naan is huge and fluffy. You order your food in the front from the lovely folks that run the restaurant, and cart your loaded cafeteria tray of food upstairs, with plenty of seating for you and a bunch of friends to goof around! Also definitely recommend the mango lassi, but otherwise there's a soda machine upstairs."
2507,WrMu2G5M2im56uYKTd4Bgw,2/24/2023,2 star rating,"A mediocre option, overall unimpressive for the value. I spent $17.50 ($15.99 plus tax) for the plate pictured, which is rice, chickpeas, and chili chicken. Naan also came with it. So I guess a decent amount of food, but basically all carbs. I had to fish out the chicken from what was otherwise all breading that fell off and onions that from afar resembled something remotely close to sauce/gravy. And this was around when they first opened and everything should have been fresh and recently made. Didn't really taste fresh, was more like cafeteria food. I counted maybe four pieces of chicken in the ""chili chicken"". Tastes weren't bad, but I've had better (fresher and more robust). Naan was good. Everything looks decent in the hot trays when you walk in (if you go in around when they first open - I can only imagine it gets progressively worse/more stale as the day goes on). Pretty oily too. Didn't have paratha. I gave it another try but for almost twenty bucks and a predictably disappointing amount of chicken, I probably won't be back."

The food is lacking that ""it"" flavor that comes from a higher profile Indian restaurant. I tried the chicken tandoori combo, but was not impressed with their meats. Moving forward, I primarily stuck to their vegetable combo which is 2 vegetable curries with naan and basmati rice for one price which I will get here. Channa masala, daal, lentil soup, and then paneer is also really good as vegetable curry choices. Also one reason which I like coming here is because they open 2AM-3AM for eating. The workers are very laid back and seating is on 2nd floor. Credit card is an extra charge so would recommend paying with cash if possible otherwise the fee is 3.5% fee from my knowledge."

2511,WrMu2G5M2im56uYKTd4Bgw,7/8/2022,4 star rating,Went to grab a late dinner and the food was delicious!! Got the combo platter which came with a side of rice and pita bread. Decided to get eggplant with sweet potato and lamb curry. Both were super super delicious!! Highly recommend the lamb curry!! Lamb didn't taste gamey at all and super tender (was able to cut through it with a plastic knife). The curry had a little kick but was well seasoned. The eggplant and sweet potato was also delicious - super soft. The rice was long grain which was perfect for curry and the pita bread was airy. Only downside is that both dishes were really oily but the portion was huge for the price (paid around $20 for the combo platter and a Snapple).
2512,WrMu2G5M2im56uYKTd4Bgw,7/30/2022,4 star rating,"I'm not sure why ""Curry in a Hurry"" doesn't have more of an obvious popular following.  This sort of working class spot feels authentic and has decent prices.  A combo platter with tiki masala, a vegetable, and naan is around $15.  I added a samosa and a drink which bumped it up to $20 and it was enough for two people. I usually eat downstairs outside or to go, but today I ventured to the upstairs dining room which was kind of kitschy and bright with huge windows and indian art.   I did double check there health score before arrival (at this writing it was an A) Even though its not fancy - this has become my go to spot in curry hill."

The food for sure is quick as everything is already prepared, they are just assembling it on a plate in front of you. I wouldn't say it was cheap nor was it expensive. 13$ for 2 veggie option, bread and rice. It's just ok. And the flavor of the food was also just ok. It felt like they really watered down the spices to cater to their clientele. I work nearby and only ever came to this place once in the 9 months I've worked at my current position... and I fucking love Indian food. There are plenty of better spots within a few blocks of this place."

I had the garlic naan which was made fresh, the chicken masala; curry lamb stew, lentil soup, spinach and the rice, the flavor were outstanding and fresh. Definitely a recommendation, for something at this timeIn the neighborhood, they open until 3am everyday."

2517,OPSCHpuBSthP7UwnMm0GSA,2/5/2023,2 star rating,"Went to dinner at Spice on Thursday evening. Simply not impressed with my order and was not intrigued by the other dishes flowing out of the kitchen.Quality: I went off-script a bit and decided to try out the Drunkman Noodles. It felt a bit like a spicier and lighter pad see ew, with lots of extras thrown in. In the end, this compilation dish felt like it had too much going on, and not enough aimed in the right direction. Too heavy on peppers, the squid texture was off, and it felt spicy without purpose. Also, the bowl it was served in was extremely irritating to eat out of.Quantity: A decent portion size.Value: $17 for the Drunkman Noodles.Ambiance: Spice has a few locations, I visited the one on the Upper West Side. It is a fairly large space, with a bar area along the right wall and then plenty of tables and chairs filling the rest of the space. There was a lot of generic decor, highlighted by large murals along the back wall. No music playing, which was odd especially with how empty the restaurant was. Crowd: Only a few other guests dining on a cold Thursday night. Service: Friendly service, made sure to check-in with us frequently.Parking: Limited street parking nearby."

2519,OPSCHpuBSthP7UwnMm0GSA,11/7/2021,3 star rating,"My colleague swears by this place.  I definitely frequent Spice when I am feeling less adventurous or want to find a place that can work for a large group.  They do have a variety of dishes but nothing particularly stands out flavor-wise.  However, this place is perfect for someone with food restrictions or particular dietary needs. There are enough options on the menu that most in a large group can have choices.  A number of the dishes include nuts, sesame oil or the like so be sure to read the dish descriptions.  They have been good at accommodating modification requests for our orders.  They make a nice thai Iced tea and their lemonade used to be a favorite of mine pre-pandemic.  The decor is very modern and clean.  The staff is efficient and move pretty quickly considering the number of takeout orders this place gets. A decent place for Thai in this particular corner of the neighborhood.  Good for a quiet solo meal, or for a catch up session with a friend.  Not a destination spot but good for the area."
2520,OPSCHpuBSthP7UwnMm0GSA,3/24/2022,3 star rating,"Spice is my go to when I want a cheap lunch special that compensates for mediocre Thai. I ordered the drunk man noodle special with shrimp, which also includes an appetizer, and I went with spring rolls. I preferred my friend's gyoza to the spring rolls. The drunken noodles were ok as expected- the shrimp definitely helped. Am I the only one who finds it awkward to eat out of the fancy little bowl because it's constantly moving on the plate? The lychee martini was flavorful but tasted more like juice than alcohol. But it was $7 or 8 with the HH special so I guess I shouldn't have expected much."

The initial order did not make it through to me so I called them again using my friend's phone after waiting an 30 more minutes in case it showed up (it didn't). Despite the miscommunication, the restaurant redid my order and sent another delivery. In 30 min, the second delivery successfully reached me. The food was amazing (I asked it to be extra spicy and they DELIVERED). Lots of chicken, evenly flavored, lots of spice just the way I like it. It's on the heavier side so I wouldn't say thay it's a daily meal but it def scratches that itch for spicy food.Though the mishap was due to my poor phone network, the restaurant's costumer service was great. This is my new fav local thai place and I'll be ordering again :)"

And then halfway through waiting, she comes over and tells us she can't make any drinks and she's sorry and hurried away:/ got the feeling she had known when taking our order, but wanted us to place our food order. She told us she couldn't make any drinks, like that's okay but tell us from the start before we place a food order:/ probably won't be back"

The lady he asked seemed annoyed, pointed to the other counter, and rudely yelled at me that she had already called out my order. Mind you - myself & my friends were the only customers in the store, and my order was never called out. Never been to this location before, so wasn't aware that drinks may come out in a different area than where all my other friends got their drinks handed to them.

Good enough for a DD breakfast sandwich.  And I like their sandwich wrapper which is sealed on two perpendicular sides - great to hold in the sandwich and the crumbs."
2571,8ms_y2pFkhVJ1xL-Q-lTmQ,6/1/2017,2 star rating,"The ladies at the register always remember my order. However, Shahid, the bagel making guy, is one rude Dunkin Donuts employee. He is one fine example of someone hating his job. I've been coming to this DD for 4 years. I order the same thing every morning: large coffee milk and sugar and a cinnamon raisin bagel toasted with cream cheese. Shahid, who makes my bagel EVERY SINGLE morning puts butter instead of cream cheese. OK, it's not a big deal since the have thousands of customers everyday. But since it's not what I wanted, I wouldn't take the bagel. He raised his voice at me to check my receipt which I don't even have since the cashiers memorized my order. He mumbles in his breath and angrily makes me another bagel. Shahid, from a professional standpoint, lacks any professionalism or the friendly attitude Dunkin Donuts strives to achieve as the local, neighborhood coffee shop. He needs improvements and training in customer service skills, triaging issues and conflicts between customers, and learning how to deal with stress with a large crowd of customers during the morning rush hours. People go into DD for one thing in the morning, a coffee or a light meal to start their day. There is no reason for someone in a customer service environment to give their customers an attitude, especially if they have been going to the same store for 4 years. Zero stars for Shahid."

Once I finally received my order an hour later, I was told I could not be given a receipt.

Waiting for coffee at this place is not worth it. Unless you don't mind waiting an average of 10 minutes for your morning cup. And if you want food other than a donut --- forget it. Your wait time will be increased by about 7 minutes. Happy waiting!"

I was feeling for the mall teriyaki chicken so I stopped into this restaurant after work, being it's not to far. I honestly should of just went to the mall! I paid close to 13 dollars for their teriyaki chicken. And shrimp over brown rice and salad. Now hear me out, I will spend my last on a meal BUT the food quality and quantity doesn't match up to their price . The food was ok nothing spectacular the customer service however was GREAT. I was in and out with no long wait time. Would I return ? I highly doubt it but I thank the workers for their excellent customer service."

I would give them 5-stars but have to go with 4 because it seems their proportions overtime have gotten smaller. I wish I had a picture from last year because they used to give a lot. I can understand a restaurant changing their servings but I miss having a lot of food. Anyways. The taste remains and to me, it's good! It reminds me of a place I used to go to at a mall in Virginia. So it gives me nostalgia. I will always choose this place on DoorDash as my go-to when I can't cook dinner or think of a lunch place to eat at. I went to the location once. It was pretty nice...of course seating was closed though because that was during heavy COVID times. And when I went there, all the employees were helpful and attentive!

The prices of gotten more expensive and the portion sizes have shrunk almost half. My last time coming here it had questionable results but we tried to give them another chance. That will not be happening again. I received 6 shrimp, in claiming it was 4 oz of beef more like 2 and a 1/2. Being someone who's had to measure their food before, I'm well aware with 4 oz looks like, like a burger patty.  And if that wasn't bad enough, I requested more veggies than rice. When we opened it and showed it to the manager he made up some nonsense and almost put his fingers in my open container!  Thank God my reflexes are fast I snapped that lid so quick, I almost caught his hand.

All of their seating and tables have been removed and pushed to the side. There is only takeout available, no delivery last I checked. That's all the updates I have as of August 2020. Their chicken teriyaki is still a winner in my heart so stop by and show this business some well deserved love. The cashier at the counter is also very nice!"

I haven't had sakura teriyaki in a long time and friend suggested here saying it's basically one level up from mall court food teriyaki.It was big spacious & clean place that have the teriyaki + bentou boxes + prepackaged sushi. I ordered #1 chicken teriyaki with extra sauce to go. It took awhile since they were making it fresh (yay for fresh hot food) and my friends got theirs first (they were ahead of me ordering so make sense they got theirs first before me).I chatted with the girl at the register while waiting for the food. She was getting off soon and going home to her little girl- stay warm girl! She was friendly and nice. Our food was hot and yummy. The extra sauce was on the side in a small container which was cool. I pour it al over my food while I ate (I ate it outside in the cold while my friend got his car washed). Food was good. I would come back =)

I got the regular chicken teriyaki platter with added on beef. Quality of meat was good for fast food and tasted like actual meat which is always a good thing. Steamed veggies were on point. I would have liked more rice tbh but I love rice so maybe that's just me, if I hadn't had the sushi rolls on the side I probably wouldn't have been full. Teriyaki chicken roll was good and Cali was also good. The portion of rice I received was almost identical compared to my boyfriends cheaper bento box, when you open it it's deceiving cause the meat is everywhere but then you start eating and realize only half the container has rice in it and on top of that it's skimped. I ran out of rice and had a ton of meat leftover. Only reason I gave them 4 stars!"

So I was pleased when work necessitated a visit to the neighborhood's most well-known Mexican stalwart for an early weekday dinner.I was not quite in the mood for a cocktail, but I can see how the extensive mezcal list and lively environs are conducive to a good time. I would certainly come back for brunch on the weekend.The vegetarian options are plentiful - based on the photos I deviated from my usually-preferred chili relleno to try the dramatic Don Plate, a delicious thali-esque smattering of rice, beans, guacamole, cheese, roasted vegetables, and a generous supply of perfectly warm and soft mini tortillas. I was worried the roasted vegetables would be on the bland side, but they were actually very flavorful, and paired well with the other items on the platter."

I've always been a bit dismissive of Chavela's as ""yet another Mexican place in Brooklyn with a line of hipsters out the door"". Well, it turns out Chavela's is great and I've just been missing out.Chavela's has a lot going for it: Food is great and reasonably priced, decor is trendy yet welcoming, and service is fast. What I like the most is that they have an extensive menu, and everything I ever tried here is great: from tacos to omelet, from chile relleno to flautas, from pastel azteca to molcajete de carnitas, from seafood enchiladas to alhambres, food at Chavela's is consistently good. I have never had a dish here that I would not eat again.Perhaps my favorite dish here is the pozole rojo, which is a perfect soup for the cold months. And I love the Don Pepino: a drink that is as wonderfully refreshing as it is green.I also like how they are accommodating for families with small children.Really, what's not to like about Chavela's?"

While the guacamole was a bit pricy for guacamole in my opinion, it was tasty and served with these large chips that were practically like flat taco shells. All in all, I enjoyed my experience here. Some items (like the guacamole) were more expensive than expected, but still, I think I'd come back again.They also have a nice happy hour. But be warned, it's limited to week days!"

I ordered their Don Pepino drink which was DELICIOUS and STRONG! Highly recommend. I also ordered some light bites since I didn't want one of their larger plates. 2 tacos (pork and steak) and a quesadilla (chicken). The food itself wasn't bad. I just wish there was more flavor... more spice. After living in SoCal for so long I'm used to getting an array of salsas from medium to hot. Not sure if they had this option ... but also hope they're not charging people for them. I'll be back for sure."

Grabbed  a seat at the bar with my cuz to watch the nba finals game and we ordered fried calamari and pizza which came out in about 10 minutes and food is very good for a pub and my cuz who is a picky lad enjoyed the food as well. The crowd is civil and this is a place where you can grab a few drinks , some food , watch sports and not look over your shoulder for possible trouble.

Shame because it looked great but tasted of dirty cast iron. But when they want a tip, they will make it known. $10 on a $23 check? You better be a saint because you have just sinned in their eyes! This was pre-COVID, so I can only imagine they are expecting you to sign over a kidney or something for half decent service. I will always have tip, more if service was amazing and you actually cared, and a little less if you obviously couldn't bother to try. But to hover over when I'm signing the check when you couldn't bother to do anything else but bring me the food? Seems pretty bad. But the worse is the ""you asshole"" stare as you walk out.

Noticed the bartender get on the horn and figured she was calling the back to place our order on an intercom to the kitchen. About 15 minutes later our wings arrived via room service tray from the Italian restaurant Bartolino's next door. They own the Tippin Inn.  Odd setup.  Was told the cook is off on Monday's. The wings were pretty good, more barbeque than buffalo and I'm glad they were delivered because on second thought I wasn't sure if it was safe to eat from this bar. The plates were initially dirty until the bartender noticed I was looking at it funny and she gave them a good wipe down.

The shrimps they use are huge (and in dishes such as their fried shrimp balls, you can tell it's not overly mixed with flour) and service is always really fast. When it comes to shu mai I hate it when you bite in an it's extremely porky (like that pork scent is overwhelming and you can tell it's not good quality meat) but their shu mai has never let me down. Personally, I'm a huge fan of their shrimp in jalapeño (sold out early) and spare rib churn fan. Their lemon honey tea slaps too.

It used to have a narrow cramp feeling when you enter. Everything looks bright and clean now (before was just darker because of the lighting). Everything still smells delicious and fresh. Most items can take a longer to come out (maybe due to covid & less customers) but once everything is out; it is heavenly.

But something has definitely changed in the past few months with the service. I go every Sunday to get ""light"" ""under-done"" ""not-overcooked"" ""soft"" bagels. I have been ordering them this way for years. Until recently, the guys behind the counter would cheerfully take a bagel out and show it to me. I give a $1 for two bagels and give a $50 holiday tip every year. Recently, I'd say since January, the counter workers seem annoyed and/or angry. They don't smile anymore. Don't tell me to have a nice day. And generally seem like they would rather be doing anything other than working there. Today the place literally had NO bagels. No one could tell me why, apologized or offered to somehow compensate me. For instance, the place could call me if/when the bagels are back. Or explain what is going on. I suspect they are either under new management that is not treating the workers right and/or the bagel making equipment desperately needs to be replaced. I will now be going to Bread Alone at the Farmer's Market on QB. Very friendly service and delicious bagels. Not as good as FHB once was. But unless I hear something has changed, I am not wasting my time going back to be treated that way."

The restaurant itself gives fast food vibes. There's only counter service and the seating isn't particularly nice. Taking a look at the food on the other side of the display case, I wasn't particularly impressed. It really looked like cafeteria food. I wasn't interested in trying any of the sides, so I just ordered chicken nuggets a la carte. I was actually pretty impressed that they had a non-fried option, so I went with the rotisserie chicken nuggets, with the spicy sauce option. The nuggets were actually pretty tasty, but fairly salty. I don't think I'd bother to come back and order them again, but they did get the job done."

They really hate there jobs.especially that ancient older spanish or white lady, raspy voice with glasses that had been there for years always looks depressed, always nasty and speaks with a rude ass tone every single time. This is her greeting ""what do you want?"" If you take to long to decide she will throw you an attitude and take the next person. Will hand you the food and no ""thank you"" Lady if you hate your job that much quit. The food here is so mediocre. And overpriced like it's red lobster. A meal for half chicken with two sides will run you $24. They literally inflated there prices by like $10 for a meal. This greedy and horribly run establishment needs to close.  I rather eat at Popeyes then this place."

I ordered a whole chicken and large side orders or Spinach and mashed potatoes. I have to say it was a big disappointment. The chicken was a little undercooked, the spinach tasted like it had no seasoning at all and the gravy for the mashed potatoes was completely tasteless and watery. I don't know if they changed ownership or management, but definitely there are new employees so the quality of the food overall is much worse than it was before. You're better off going to KFC or Popeyes for chicken, it'll taste much better and cost much less. Today was my last visit to this location."

Their sweet potato mash and cornbread were always my favorites. However, the quality has definitely gone down, items are often missing/not served the day of, and the portion sizes have gotten smaller and smaller rip. My family has ordered a thanksgiving set from here a few times and it's truly complete madness in the store when we arrive the night before to pick everything up. It gets disorganized pretty quickly and we've once waited over an hour - since then, we've stopped ordering from here :/ In terms of the pros though, service has always been efficient whenever I've come in and this location has plenty of seating upstairs."

But I would expect them to at least have food that's mildly edible. We ordered via Grubhub tonight because we needed something quick that wasn't pizza and I haven't had Boston Market in years. Food was prepared quickly and delivered quickly as well. Maybe it's my fault for ordering ribs from Boston Market. I'm not really sure what came over me. They are the most disgusting things I've ever had. First of all - there was the smallest dollop of BBQ sauce on them, and the rest were just plain ribs. Horrible taste. Just avoid these things. Mashed potatoes had no gravy and it was not included anywhere in my order.And the chicken - for a chain that has chicken as it's signature item, you'd think they would at least get that right? The chicken was so small and overcooked that the wings on it were pretty much dried of any meat. Fair tasting chicken, just wish there was more of it. Probably the last time I ever order from a Boston Market. $60 for a family meal that left everyone disappointed and had my kids asking for PB&Js instead."

The worst part is that they send dried out food to the people who order online, I have had their food in-house and it's cooked perfectly fine. Every time I order online, dried-out food and the missing piece trick.I hope corporate pays attention to these reviews."

Listen, not everybody around here is a brownstone owner and can afford to pay $40 for a candle. Cute selection, sure, but completely unaffordable. They market themselves as some sort of a community center (they also have a cafe and do events), but it's very clear what ""community"" they want in their store - for that reason alone I won't be visiting again.

I'm doing more research to see if this is even legal.Their owner, Jill, is also extremely rude. Having spent nearly $300 in her store, you'd think she would accommodate me when one of her products that I purchased broke. She never explained how to care for it, the material or anything. Initially Donna had offered to accommodate me but then Jill strung me along for two weeks then finally came to a conclusion that ""she is not responsible"" pretty much saying I already have your money.I was excited to support a local business but this shop clearly only caters to the ""new culture"" of the neighborhood, not old Brooklyn who built that community.If you care about your hard earned dollars, don't shop here. Please BEWARE!!!!! Jill was nice when I handed over the money, then turned evil when we asked for help with our product that she didn't explain how to care for and whose colleague offered to help."

I got a passionfruit with boba, and it was not the most flavorful tea, and the boba texture was not very chewy and didn't have much flavor, but it was an even $5 each, which is great for a sit-down cafe in this economy.

Teapots are $7 a pot but I order them anyway because they offer something I don't typically see in other cafes.They're teapots are actually quite fascinating; it's inspired us to get one for the home.  The teacups are double hulled glass so it's not hot to the touch even when your tea is HOT.Haven't tried their deserts but the waffle looks like diabetes served in a plate.

Don't like greasy , don't order fried. This place has been feeding people in Starett City for over twenty years . My friend who use to live here comes all the way from Long Island to Get Chicken and Broccoli in white sauce .So stop the  BS you know you'll be back for more lol.If you don't like chinese food , don't order it. The shopping center has plenty of parking and security is right there all the time.Just cause the surroundings aren't great doesn't mean that it's like that in the shopping center. I've eaten there food many years and it's a lot better than at least 50 other take outs , so lighten Up. Try there shrimp with lobster sauce , or there sesame chicken. Ask them to cut the top to allow the steam out for the chicken stays nice and crispy. The short ribs are good as well. Beef chow fun is a meal in itself , need I go on. Everyone knows you half to roll your shrimp roll in a paper towel , same way you put a napkin on your pizza to get excess oil out lol."

They're very short with you. Some people may be used to that sort of behavior but not me. When I come to an establishment to do business and give my hard earned money I expect respect. I gave them my order, and left to go pick up some dry cleaning. When I came back and got order; Mind you the whole time it was raining out, They hand me my shrimp rolls in brown paper bag. I asked for plastic bag, because it was raining outside. They completely ignored me. I had to ask a few times before they finally gave in and gave me one. When I got home...Guess what, There was only 2 shrimp rolls in the bag, when I clearly ordered and Paid for 3When I called them and tried to explain what happened the woman  acted like she didn't understand English. She pretended like she had No idea what I was talking about, and hung up on me. I called back. Another woman answers I explain again that they left out the third shrimp roll from my order. She then tells me to come pick it up. I told her its pouring down raining now. I'll come by later when the rain stops.  When the rain stops I go back there to pick up my shrimp roll. When I do I notice the girl goes to the back and brings it up to me.Now, it been over 2 hours, it probably had been sitting on  some  dusty shelf the whole time. On my way home I'm thinking should I eat this. Forget  about asking for my money back because,I know they would definitely give me a hard time.  So I didn't even bother asking. Plus I wouldn't be surprised if they did something to my shrimp roll I wouldn't put it past them. I  just took the L, and  when I got home I  threw the shrimp roll in garbage. I'm tired of giving these people second chances.Never Again Will I order From That Establishment."

I called and told them and they said they would deliver another order. 30 minutes later when my other food is cold, they deliver the chicken but wouldn't give it to me b/c I didn't bring the other one down to give it back. I asked why didn't they tell me they needed it back prior to me coming all the way downstairs... at this point they've already wasted enough of my time. The delivery guy literally would not give me the chicken until I went back upstairs to give him the old hard one. I guess they thought I was lying, ate it and was just trying to get over on them. I will NEVER order from here again.This was my initial review....They have the best fried chicken wings I've ever had from a Chinese restaurant. I get mines chopped and fried well. Their fried rice is also very good as well as the broccoli in brown sauce. I don't like their garlic sauce..."

We were a pretty early reservation as we like to be in bed by 8 (kidding. But am I?). Anyway we chose to be seated outside as their set up is so beautiful. They don't have heaters yet but it was not necessary. With the lights strung very romantic. Service is very friendly and they have sanitizer if you need it. We went with the house red wine which was quite potent. Not the most bougie wine I've had but it did the trick. After two glasses I was feeling as happy as a Tiramisu. First course was a burrata and prosciutto platter. No complaints here. Hard to go wrong. Came with bread and a broccoli rabe purée on top of the olive oil. Quite tasty. Short rib- massive. It was tasty and tender. Mash was a little meh. Reminded me of the box kind. Not that earthy goodness with a skin or two still in there. Overall taste 8.5/10. For the price I think this is a little on the pricey side for what you get. But then again it's been a while since we've been out so maybe my perspective is skewed. Beef BOLOGNESE- fantastic. I was in love with this dish. Noodles not overcooked nice and toothy. The sauce was excellent too. The sauce we great, was not brimming with flavortown flavor but pretty darn good 9/10. Would order again. I think a great value for the price. We weren't stuffed after the meal which was nice as we had a dessert date nearby (follow the next review to see where). Overall pleasant place to bring the family or for date night."

The food was good, nothing spectacular where I would run back, but overall good. We ordered a Margherita pizza, a glass of white and red sangria, penne piccanti, and paccheri. Tiramisu for dessert. The music in the restaurant was way too loud. The biggest issue during our restaurant experience was that there were 5-8 fruit flies surrounded around and on our table the entire time. We kept trying to swat them away the entire meal. Got to the end of the meal and asked for the check. 10 minutes went by and no check received (there were only two other tables in the restaurant occupied). Had to get up and ask for the check again. Not a great experience, probably would not dine in again."

The food is hit or miss. The eggplant melanzane was good, I would pass on the zucchini blossoms which were overly fried and tasteless. The penne Alla vodka was more cream butter based I would rate it a 5/10. If you prefer a very creamy buttery version this is for you however it was a touch bland and better suited for the childrens menu. The steak was good, healthy portion and served with a nice arugula side. Overall I would order from here in a pinch but it would not be my first option given the hit or Miss of the food. Important to note is that the prices were not the same as on the website. Many prices on the website are about $1-4 dollars more on the actual menu. A note on the service is that the waiters tended to direct all communication to my male partner who commented on the weirdness of the interactions."

The came across this restaurant on Groupon and purchased the deal to experience their hospitality. Reservations were required and the host was pretty accommodating even though I happened to be their earlier then I intended to. On a Saturday night around 7pm I was probably expecting the area to be crowded and troublesome for parking. But luckily I found parking the a block away from the restaurant. Me and my brother were greeted by the host and seated at our table. I liked the table setup simple yet nice. Complimentary bread was given to us once seated. We ordered melenzane, for appetizer which was good but ridiculously small in portion. For entree we ordered franceso ravioli and risotto. Now risotto was good but the ravioli was awful. The portion was ridiculously small and it was heavily salted. I don't like excessively salted food. For dessert we ordered hot chocolate and Panna cotta (absolutely delicious but they surely cheated us on the berries and the portion). I even asked our host what happened to the berries can I get some more because we had only 1 but we were never given any!!"

I have a strong love for Caribbean food and I must say picky eaters is my top 5 favorites. These authentic flavors of the island are remarkable. The chef really knows what he is doing. It's a nice spot to come and sit and enjoy dinner. Service is pretty quick , the music is really good. If not the music there is something good on the television.  If you don't know what to get the staff will make some great suggestions and trust take them. After eating your bomb meal don't skip out getting some desert! Can't wait till my next visit."

Macaroni pie was bland and ok.  Tried the jerk chicken gyro.  It was spicy so there was some heat but again it was sauced jerk chicken in a wrap.  Wings in sweet sauce was the best thing and again just ok.  Won't be back until you step up the food and the flavor.   Thanks but no thanks...

Even though the line was long, it moved relatively quickly and we were able to get to the front of the line in about 25 minutes.They have a wide selection of flavors, and they even have granitas! I ordered the Chocolate Hazelnut in a Kiddie Cone, and it was the perfect amount for 1 person. The ice cream tasted just like nutella and had a super thick and creamy texture. It melted really quickly since outside was about 85F, but it was delicious while it lasted!"

For $4.50, I received a kid's scoop of chocolate gelato with chocolate sprinkles. It was extremely pricy for the size I got, but the scoop was more than enough for me.The gelato was fine but I've ate much creamier gelato in the past. The sprinkles had a weird taste which turned me off.If you're on the boardwalk and in need of a sweet treat, check out Coney's Cones. Just don't get the chocolate sprinkles!"

I got the 3 scoop for $8.50 with a cone. I got the pistachio, coney custard, and mango. The pistachio flavor had a good flavor but the pistachio nuts on it were a bit stale. The coney custard barely had flavor. The mango flavor tastes somewhat like the frozen mangoes that aren't too sweet from Costco. My friend got the pumpkin spice flavor and it was okay but I wasn't a huge fan of the fall flavor either. The flavors were underwhelming and not creamy. The waffle cone was crunchy though."

Coney's Cones absolutely blew me away. There was a line out the door which was an obvious giveaway of either great ice cream...or desperate suffering hot patrons.  Luckily, it was the demand for the incredible Ice cream. Very rich, just the right amount of sweet, and the scoops are generous."

I didn't mind removing the flies with my spoon, however, what I thought would be a nice experience was not that great. The gelato melted really quickly, it was messy, really expensive, and wasn't worth it. Also, the worker from last summer that worked the mini coney cones stall by steeple chase  told me they kept their ice cream overnight in a freezer for days to a week when the ice cream didn't sell. That, for 5.50 a scoop on a cone is ridiculous."

What seemed like a tourist trap actually sold very decent gelato, and I'm not a big fan of gelato! We got our ice cream on cones, which was nice as well - subtly sweet, but not a waffle cone.We got the milano cookie flavor, which has a base vanilla + mystery flavor that we couldn't figure out (banana? coffee?) along with these bits of milano cookies + nutella + oreo. It didn't really taste like that to me, but that's what the guy there said - it was still good.The coney island custard flavor was very nice, and I would get this flavor again - hit the spot right away."

Between the lackluster flavor to their food and the all-out price gouging, they should rethink their business model. I understand as well as anyone the plight of small businesses since and actually before covid but here's an example of how NOT to treat your customer base. Sadly, the Grandpa's is taking clear advantage in the incredibly tough to swallow raised prices with no maintaining or improving their quality standards. The fact that their closest competition geographically is even Worse (Pizza Haven)  is the only reason they're getting any traction and the better pizza places don't cover this area any longer which is unfortunately sad.If you want suffer highway robbery and have a less than stellar pizza experience, you can just order once (so you can say you gave them a fair shot) and you'll agree it's not worth the return experience.

The restaurant is bright and modern, very welcoming. We chose to sit at the bar seats, figuring we'd be close to where the magic happens. The owner was nice and friendly. We selected both of their special sets of 9 pierogis, the Prince Albert featuring black garlic and another one that featured a Czech cheese. We also ordered the golden beet salad, figured it couldn't hurt to add something healthy.The pierogis were just the right size. They were perfect texturally and the fillings were delicious! We ate them rather quickly, while trying to pick a favorite. (Unsuccessfully as they were both too good) The golden beet salad provided a nice contrast, flavorful and fresh. It must be nice to live in a neighborhood that features these delicious pierogis! I'll certainly be looking to return."
2707,eIbKiQuExi12NcGeqMzQAw,2/18/2023,4 star rating,"Food: warm, hearty, and filling. What more can you ask for? These pierogis are the epitome of comfort food. They are pillows of cheesy, carby goodness. Each pierogi is boiled or fried to perfection (yes I know for both cooking types because I ordered some of each). The flavors are unique with different types of cheeses and dips to choose from. Tip: make sure to ask for apple sauce with your pierogis; the tartness of the apple cuts beautifully through the richness of the pierogi filling!Service: welcoming and friendly, if a tad bit slow. The place generally gave off a homey, cozy vibe, so we were in no rush.I'll definitely be back here on a cold winter day!"

Between us, we ordered the pan seared bacon pcheddar potato pierogies, pan seared potato and cheese pierogies, boiled Prince Albert special, and schnitzel bites.As somebody who has never had pierogies before, everything tasted delicious. When you order pierogies, you have an option for them to be boiled or pan seared. I personally prefer the pan seared option a little more for the extra crunchy texture on the outside, but also really enjoyed the boiled Prince Albert ones.I've had schnitzel before but only ever as a flattened patty, never as a fried ball before. This form factor is definitely superior as it makes the dish sharable for a group, and perfect for dipping.If you've never had pierogies before, I cannot recommend Baba's enough for a first time experience. The food here is fantastic."

At $15 for 9 (not including the onions and mushrooms) it was pricier than I would have liked. The onions were not very sweet and buttery, but I was still satisfied overall. The schnitzel bites fell apart easily and again were like $14 for a small portion. They were ok but seem like a trendy take on schnitzel with more filling than meat. Mac salad was seasoned nicely, golden beets could have used a bit more.Service was lukewarm at first. I arrived before Omicron had made the news but it still seemed like they weren't entirely comfortable with indoor diners. The front door was propped open on the first cold night of the year, people coming in were made to wait in the narrow hall by the open door to either read the menu or get a table. The door stayed open during my meal, but I was hungry enough that I think eating kept me warm. Eventually my waitress seemed to warm up to me too, but I did end up spending more than I would have wanted for the experience."

The pierogis are delicious. The wrapping is perfect- not too thin or thick. You can choose from different fillings. My favorite so far has been the spinach and feta. I've also had the sausages, sauerkraut, and beet salad. All were fantastic and well cooked. I'm also not one for dessert but omg their blueberry pierogis I dream about!! The blueberries are so plump and sweet and juicy and inside the most perfectly cooked dumpling with whipped cream...ugh! I'm coming back for you."

To celebrate the new year, instead of dumplings (to represent wealth) I thought it would be fun to go for pierogies. Given nuanced schedules over the holidays, I made sure to check their Instagram, in which they helpfully said that they were talking an extra day off for Jan 2nd, but would be open tomorrow ""11:30-9""! I trekked out on Jan 3rd, excited for my favorite potato pierogies with caramelized onions, and made the 45 minute trip in the freezing cold only to find that at 12:30, an hour after their opening time, the gates were shut.If you're going to go through the trouble of posting updates on IG please at least make sure the info is correct. Otherwise I would have called to confirm and saved myself an hour and a half in the cold."

One time I ordered Sophie's 3 times in a row for dinner lol. The chicken is always juicy and sides come in big portions. The green sauce is very delicious. The value is just too good. Usually I pay an arm and a leg for delivery but I know I'm getting a solid meal for a decent price with Sophie's.

The price was also very reasonable for NYC as it was the special for the day. That is the only reason why I tried it was for the price. One thing is I wish they cut off more of the fat. The guava cheese empanada was better than what I've had else where. I will revisit if I'm in the area again. Service was fast and efficient."

2725,KzEWelsUm5zumC7s2RW1xA,12/18/2020,4 star rating,"Sophie's dishes out generous portions of Cuban goodness, as reliable and comforting as a visit to your abuelita's. I typically go to locations in Manhattan, but the morning of the snowstorm the family had a hankering for something tasty. Something that would put meat on your bones. Time to visit the Downtown Brooklyn Sophie's. They recently shifted locations down the block (I think earlier this year they were closer to Willoughby! Now they're  just south of Brooklyn Tab on Smith).I've always been loyal to Sophie's for the oxtail and the empanadas. I also ordered the beef stew (ropa viejo) and a Cubano sandwich. The maduros are always excellent, I also like the string bean and beet salad. The side veggie medley always surprises me that they're cooked al dente and not a soggy mess. My one complaint is that Sophie's food is saltier than I typically would make my food, but for an indulgence, its okay. Portions are always good, I often have enough for a meal and a half. Prices are more than fair when you consider the quantity. Staff are responsive - they called me when one of my side dishes were out within a few minutes of the order going in.For COVID, the indoor dining is all packed up, and there is no outdoor seating. All order are to go. They have hand sanitizer and plexiglass to keep customers and staff safe. Everyone had gloves and masks. There are dots on the floor to remind you to social distance. On a Wednesday at noon, it was surprisingly empty here, it looks like they're surviving on the takeout business - call directly and shop local y'all."

It is also open till late so you can stay as long as you would like, it's never crowded when i go there which is around 5 PM to 8 PM so it is a very good chill out spot.

I came here late late Monday or Tuesday, can't remember (aka the place was unremarkable)Let me tell you why:-3 people took our order. All 3 people came back to see if we had ordered or not 15 Minutes later-What we ordered: Coffee, tea, a chocolate crossant, cheesecake40 minutes later the coffee and chocolate crossant come out. Um ok were you baking the pastery in the back? I asked where my items were. The guy looked at me like I was nuts. I restated my order and he ran away only to come back 10 minutes later to tell me no cheesecake.OK that only took you 50 minutes to tell me....... ok I will have the pudding...... NO PUDDING HUH? OK HOW ABOUT YOU JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE............ A BROWNIE? SURE IF THATS THE ONLY LEFT SUREEEE.................Hey buddy! MY TEA? How about that? urghhhhhhhhhhhh..................Finally my stuck came. After the ""service part"" was done we started having a good time.

2729,1WaunYNjHLEahIxfSo06Yg,7/31/2011,3 star rating,"The major drawback of this place is that there is no WiFi (they loose 2 stars for this). They already put so much effort and money into the place that it's hard to understand why, and it's the only place on the island with hookah that has no WiFi. They are open very early which makes it tempting to make the drive all the way to the southern tip of the island, but I find myself not bothering because of the lack of WiFi.The place is very well decorated and has two booth spots with curtains that resemble more traditionally Middle Eastern places that have these areas. There is even a little water fountain, and choices between standard table seating and leather sofas.They have a very wide selection of snacks and drinks but no alcohol. They do not serve meals, but there are so many things to snack on that you could hold yourself over until you go eat.The hookah was quite a bit better than most places on the island, except that they do use the round chemical coals, and the waitress overstuffed the head, but it didn't seem to cause a problem. You can request natural coals, but the staff admitted she doesn't use them often and would put them on when they weren't fully hot yet, and then they would go out soon after. Hookahs are $15."
2730,1WaunYNjHLEahIxfSo06Yg,5/27/2019,2 star rating,"This place is definitely not worth your money. The hookah is $18 and if someone in your group doesn't get a hookah there is a cover fee of $14.95. The hookah itself is subpar compared to other good spots in Staten Island. Also, they took gratuity for our group of four and a credit card charge if you don't pay cash. Basically, they find ways to milk your money!"

2732,1WaunYNjHLEahIxfSo06Yg,1/5/2016,1 star rating,"From their bubble tea to the atmosphere, one thing is for sure: this place is awful. First off, the music. Every night that I have been here, they have rap music blasting, completely ruining the potential of this place being a calm, relaxing hookah lounge. Half the time the staff just switches songs midway through. Next is the food and drinks: the bubble tea comes out of a packet and the tapioca is hard. The prices are modest at best. Hookah prices are pricey, especially the mixed flavors. There are always regulars that seemingly smoke for free all night long. Teenagers swamp the place, especially on Fridays.

Another is the amount of annoying staten island kids in there. The only other hookah place I go to is 101 Cafe at Akron Place of off Richmond Ave....only because it has a full bar, dancing and parties .... and those kinds of things are important to me :)"

2737,6gl5cTB4mqpIbN2pIwD6hA,12/12/2022,2 star rating,Overpriced. The food is okay at best. They charge you for every single little topping you want so essentially it's $4+ for just 2 tortillas with a little meat on it. The cheese they put on looks like they just sprinkled Kraft cheese on the tortilla & stuck it in the microwave. The rice tastes like box microwave rice. I've gone to bakeries that sell way more loaded tacos for the same price as these sparse ones.

I am pleased to say that this is definitely one of the top five hidden gems in the Bronx. Upon arrival we were greeted by friendly staff, and the warm aromas of the delicious meal that awaited us. We devoured two tamale combos that came with all the fixings. Best tamales we have ever had thus far. Don't take my word for it go check it out! P.S   Ask for the special tamales of the day, and take a second plate home. I promise you won't regret it!"

I've had this spot bookmarked foreverrrr, but their hours of business and working in midtown never let me stop by. Cue in crazy quarantine schedule and finally! A long overdue visit absolutely worth the trip (and wait).I'm very fortunate that I get authentic Michocuan style tamales from a family friend in MD (and even shipped) so yes-- my standards are pretty high. City Tamale does not miss a beat! They definitely held up to my standards. I got about a dozen to go, in many flavors, but of course I had to eat some while I was there! Decided to go with the salsa verde and habanero chicken with the works. Let me just tell you, the pickled onions are bomb on their own. The tamales? Picantito pero no peligroso. A little spicy, but not dangerous. I'm pretty sure I ate more of my boyfriend's tamal then he did. I just could not stop myself. Took a couple to his Dominican mom who's fallen in love with Mexican tamales and she was super thrilled to have them! She's been asking when we're going back. The chicken Mole poblano was so yummy as well as the Raja's con queso. Can't wait to stop by for some champurrado when the weather gets colder. The staff was also super gracious and made the visit even better. Gracias City Tamale!"

My partner opted for the carnitas lunch special, with a chicken tinga tamal and a small side salad. I chose to start with one of the things tamales, a pork salsa rojo, and a street style taco with steak. The taco came out after I'd demolished the first part of my order, but that was not a problem, as I already knew I'd be going back to order more.The tamales have a perfect ratio of filling to masa, and the chicken tinga ones were astoundingly flavorful. The pork within the other is tender and mild, like straned Baby Jesus in a corn husk. The carnitas, which I sampled, was a bit dry, but aided by the salsa verde which eventually accompanied my taco.The taco could - should - have been an absolute highlight, but the cut of beef they used in mine was so tough that two one inch long pieces were not really edible. The flavor was exceptional, with a lovely amount of char, but it would have benefitted greatly from some tenderization. The cilantro and onions were very fresh, and the double corn tortillas were among the best I've ever had.We did, as I mentioned, order yet more tamales, and ate until we were fairly stuffed. I even redeemed the check-in offer for a free one, which - be warned - doesn't take one off your bill, but sends you home with one as a fun breakfast snack for the following day.All in all, prior to this visit, the only thing I'd ever have travelled recreationally to the Bronx for was a Yankees game. Now, if I find myself with a few hours to waste and craving some comfort food, I would actually make this trip for no other reason than a comforting, delicious, and inexpensive lunch."

I'm so glad I made time to check it out. I had the signature tamales and they were so so soooo gooood. It came with crema and more sauces. I also enjoyed the side of rice and beans with guacamole. Honestly, it was a whole meal!!!This will definitely be my secret go to spot this summer. It's my favorite spot in Hunts Point now. Traveling by bus was easy and efficient. My friend and I enjoyed ourselves and our lunches. The staff was friendly and made sure we had what we needed. The yellow walls made me happy and the decor was nice. Please stop here and give this place a try.... the tamales are worth it. The menu is worth it. The drinks are great too. I had lemonade and it was amazing. I left with tacos for dinner later that night. I'm so happy they have a 3 for $10 deal. Lastly, I loved that there was also a small area to sit and watch what was happening outside. I had a great experience and I will be telling everyone from every borough to visit. It's a must if you're visiting South Bronx. Put this place on your list!!!!I will definitely be back. I have to try their Birria tacos next!!!! I'm so excited!!!"

Mind you, this at 1:30 in the afternoon, To my surprise, they were out of all of them except Chicken( which was fair at best). They also ran out of corn toppings. Is it too much to ask a tamale named restaurant  to have Tamales in stock?. This is like McDonalds running out of burgers. The nice young man at the counter was apologetic( hence the two stars), said there was some event, which is no excuse, they should be prepared for that. If you still want to get tamales here, Call beforehand as they always run out. Also , parking is horrible"

She set aside my order which was a couple black bean vegan, Rajas con queso, and a couple chicken salsa verde. When I got there she said my name! BIANCA! I felt home lmao. We had great convo and even promised me a shirt on my next visit! Ok so the tamale as taste DELICIOUS! The masa hits soooooooo perfect. They really perfected that tamale masa. Not dry at all!!!! Super moist, flavorful, and soft. I don't eat meat anymore so I had the vegan and rajas con queso. Yo! So impressed! Every bite. My friend and I were so satisfied.

Not horrible, just not memorable or return-worthy for me.Went to this location, and it was just meh. One of my favorite boba spots is actually a spot in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles called ""Sunright Tea Boba"" and it's more or less a frame of reference when I try different Boba spots.The location can be easy to miss due to the scaffolding hiding the signage. The inside is just one of those get in & get out type vibes, and honestly the drinks were just mad plain. The customer service I received was friendly, and I really can't complain on that front though. This spot just gives me the vibe of ""We're established and not going anywhere"" so they just do what they need to make ends meet.Another spot that I've actually had in the city that I preferred more than this was ""Tea+Milk"" in the Chelsea Market that had their own interesting cream concoction, and the boba was much better."

Today, however, one of my house guest found a hair in their food. Which was caught between pieces of bacon. Rather than take responsibility for their actions upon calling the woman on the phone insisted that it was ""impossible.""I hadn't called with animosity or rude intent, I kindly requested a replacement order. Now, I believe her when she told me that the restaurant takes special care with their food. But there is always margin for error. I'd ordered all the time - I simply wanted a new order of that one platter as we had in fact found a hair - which could have happened to any restaurant. Their inability or unwillingness to hold themselves accountable and accommodate a customer that hadn't had any prior issues in past months was a HUGE turn off for me. Any company is only as good as their customer service. It could have simply been the woman who answered the phone - either way she is a representative of the restaurant."

Chicken with Broccolie 4. Eggfoo Young ""Shrimp & Pork""1. Chicken wings were smaller than a packet of Duck Sauce. I swear these are Pigion wings and not Chicken Wings. You can count the little pieces of pork in the rice, Never have I ordered and gotten so little pork in the rice and tiny Chicken Wings. 2. Sesame Chicken was Fire Red and Over Spicy, it's supposed be very lightly spicy, not burning your lips spicy and fire red in Color, that alone says they over spiced it. Sesame Chicken came in a Medium Card Board Chinese box, which was a small serving also. 3. Chicken with Broccolie was the only decent dish in this order. 4. Eggfoo Young Was Burnt on outside. Semi raw in side full of onions, 1 shrimp and 2-3 pieces of pork, this eggfoo Young was mostly Onion and egg, again, very cheap with Shrimp and Pork, which is what I ordered. Called and spoke with Owner or Manager? They claimed wings were small because that is how the company gave it to them, So I suggested to them, to add more wings if they are so small, he said he can't because the order brings only 4 wings. I told him, yes 4 regular size wings, but when they are small, you need to add more wings to make up for the lost on size. He kept arguing with me on how it's not his fault and it's the company that sent it. Complained about burned l, semi cooked inside and sour tasting Eggfoo Young. He claims that is how it's cooked everywhere. I am the customer who is eating this and have been for over 40 years so please don't tell me an Eggfoo Young is suppose to be burned on the outside ""Black"" Sour tasting either. Sound to me like your oil was old ""Sour Taste"" and Oil temperature was to high, take blame where blade is do, don't blame the customer because your chef sucks. Your cheap with your food and your cooking with old and burnt oils. In the end, I had to hang up on owner, because he preferred to argue and blame me for his cheap portion, bad tasting food. He said he would credit me a chicken wing, are you kidding me? Just shows to how cheap he is. Please view pictures of food so you can judge for yourself. In the End, Eggfoo Young which consisted of 95% onions and not Shrimp and Pork as I ordered. If I can give this place no stars I would. Very dissapointed in this Chinese restaurant which is very inconsistent with their Servings and Food quality as well as taste. Never will I order from this place again. You want to be cheap, I can be cheaper and never order again from you crooks, ""Wang's Garden""."

It didn't look like much, appeared as your typical 'bigger' deli in a much busier area in town serving food for long hours. However, for how basic it looked the food was great, and of course the selection was big. They worked fast even though there weren't that many customers when I walked in.I ordered a bacon and eggs on a toasted roll, a small french fries, a croissant, and a bottle of water. Pretty hypocritical of me calling the appearance of this place basic, but then ordering the most basic New York bodega meal you can get! The bacon and eggs was delicious and packed with flavor, not just from the salt and pepper, but from the thick juicy bacon and the fluffy fried egg. My roll wasn't toasted to nice crisp I like but it definitely had a real nice soft and thin crispy exterior texture to it.The french fries were simple enough, crispy and hot with some nice hot sauce to go alongside it. Call me odd but I prefer hot sauce over ketchup when it comes to my fries or fried food in general. The croissant was a little tough, as if it was sitting there since morning. Fortunately, it wasn't tough to the point I really had to give it a tough chew just to break it down. It still had that buttery flavor and flaky exterior that sure made a bit of a mess on my sweatshirt.3 In 1 Kitchen was a nice little spot for a quick filling bite, and its so convenient it was right next to the hospital. Service was good and I was in and out quick. Will definitely revisit this place again whenever my father needs to go for check-ups to the doctor's office nearby!"

Maggie says you have to order something else if you want the food delivered.  I said why? How much is the minimum for delivery? She says $7.00.  I say...okay how much is my order? She says $7.25.  I say... okay I meet the minimum so why can't you deliver the food? She says...Because it is really busy right now so unless you order over $10 I cant send it to you.  She says...just order something else...like water or anything else. So I said...so you are basically telling me that unless I add $3.00 more to my order you will not deliver it that does not seem fair considering I meet the minimum for delivery.  I say...Do you think it's right that you are making me spend $3.00 more of food than I want or need.  She says... sorry I only have one delivery guy.  Then she says...you know what if you want to wait and can send you the food if I get another delivery in that direction.  I say...so you are telling me I would have to wait until someone else orders food and I would have to wait until an order is placed that is in my general direction all with no guarantee that my food will come is that correct?  She says yes.  I said it okay, no thank you please cancel my order.  I hung up with her, I walked over to my kitchen and made my own breakfast.  You guys just lost out on a sale of $7.25.  Actually, you lost out on much much more because all of my future business will now be going to your competitors down the street."

I've tried several sandwiches and soups from this place. The soups are very good for deli standards. Most of it seems to be fresh made and not from cans like most other deli places that serve soup. Next time your in the area give this place a try.

Staff and auxiliary staff of Maimonides Hospital2. Family of patients of Maimonides Hospital.Other than a few other local spots, it's pretty much a captive audience.  They usually have enough seats as long as you don't come during prime time (i.e. 12-2) and even so, they often have seating even in prime time.They only have prepared foods during the weekdays, and they're normally pretty good.  If you work here or have a relative who's really sick, you'll see the food patterns.  They have ribs once or twice a week, they have one or two chicken dishes a day, one of them being chicken breasts which nobody eats (today was lemon chicken breasts).Aside from the prepared foods, they have your typical assortments of cold cuts, salad stuff, and appetizer stuffs like meatballs , stuffed grape leaves, potato salad, etc.They make all kinds of sandwiches.  Paninis, breakfast sandwiches, bagel sandwiches, subs, etc.  The burgers here are actually quite tasty.Lastly they have a wide assortment of candies, chips, gums, etc.There is a LOT of choice here, and some of it is even good.  I do enjoy their ribs greatly, and some of their prepared foods are delicious in an oily and unhealthy kind of way.  They have pork for those who love pork.  Heh.Slightly expensive, but they do have a more or less captive audience.I just wish they took credit cards.  For that reason I usually go to J&J Hot Food and Salad, a few stores down... they take credit cards with an $8 minimum."

This is a wonderful patisserie to grab a macaron with a cafe au lait or a baguette: turkey with cornichons, home made tuna salad, smoked salmon with cream cheese on pumpernickel bread.. is your appetite waking up? top it with a cup of chicken or vegetable soup?  Are you feeling warm and cozy? There's also gluten free potato pancakes, salads, panini's.. yes this a top of the line gourmet patisserie. The possibilities are endless!After our long walk through Central Park and trying to spot Flaco the runaway owl, we decided to stop by for a warm pick me up.I ordered an Americano and Rochelle had the chai latte.. We shared a bit of decadence: the Belgian chocolate mousse with a dark chocolate topping. I also ordered a decorated cookie for a future dessert.The Americano was a bit strong and needed two packets of sugar in the raw. Rochelle savored her Chai.The mousse was deliciously rich with a velvety texture. There was a hardened piece of dark chocolate swirled through out the mousse and after we got to the bottom, there lie.. cake! Whew! A sugar rush for sure.I took half of mousse home.. too rich to consume all of it.The patisserie has a very cozy and soothing feel.. perfect for a post Bloomingdales shopping visit or post Central Park stroll. Little tables with parlor chairs that are comfy and allows one to sit, relax and enjoy a sweet or savory bite.The service is very friendly and accommodating.Merci beaucoup indeed!"

Even though it was loud my family and I could still hear each other. We loved the macaroons and the beautiful pastry displays behind the counter.I had the gluten-free potato pancake. It was amazing! Not greasy like many others. My family had some quiches and muffins - they said they were delicous.The coffee was so-so.I recommend for a quick stop-in!

You buy your food at the counter and find a seat. They do have some little round tables inside and out.  It was awfully busy at nearly 2 pm, but we snagged a table in a corner and it was fine.My friend had the tomato and mozzarella panini, which they toasted. She ate half, which I thought was not much to eat.  I chose the chicken chipotle sandwich on a mini baguette. It was a mush. A chicken salad so finely chopped that it was almost a spread, and fairly tasteless.  I guess the chipotle was in the Mayo but I didn't discern any kick to it. There were a few thin, sickly-looking slices of avocado on top.  I ordered tea, was asked large or small, said small but got a large cup. I wasn't going to argue.  Mt friend had a small coffee. We had the chance to catch up with each other, which was nice, and nobody was rushing us out, but the food was yuck.  Maybe I'll chance another visit just for coffee and a sweet treat, but I surely won't have lunch there again."

There is an outdoor area and it seems heated.Once my friends arrive time to order. Order is by QR code basically almost zero interaction with wait staff. Orders placed via QR code then delivered to your table.  Bit of a negative for me but some may like this option.FoodOrdered a friend chicken sandwich with fries and added avocado.

Didn't have to wait, which was great, and walked right into a spacious and inviting dining room. We ordered the sweet potato hash and the sausage egg biscuit. Everything was solid--not the best brunch but not the worst.The one downside to our dining experience that's worth noting is that you have to order and pay through your mobile phone using the QR at the table. There is no waiter service other than bringing out your food that you've ordered at through your phone. I recognize that QR menus are now the standard, however it was quite annoying to have to order and pay via app. Felt like what's the point of dining in?"
2798,srqlsWg0od6soGI2Zf8mXA,10/29/2022,5 star rating,"To celebrate a few October birthdays my friend made a reservation for 15-20 people at Edie Jo's. About 15 people showed up (not all at once; there were a few groups arriving at different times) and were seated immediately. Propped up on the wall was a cute sign wishing all of the October babies a happy birthday, which was a nice touch.In general the food was good, but it was my first time in the area so I'm not sure how it compares to nearby restaurants. I tried a few appetizers (decent but not particularly memorable) as well as the shrimp with remoulade and cauliflower soup. They were tasty but perhaps too salty? A few folks ordered the chicken sandwich and it looked so good that I felt like I might've made a mistake with the shrimp and soup.A few days before the reservation I'd asked if I could store some birthday pies at EJ's for celebrating after dinner. The staff (particularly Kit and the chef, whose name I forgot to get) were super accommodating. After dinner I asked for the pies to be brought out and expected them to just put them on the table with some plates and let us fend for ourselves, but they actually went the extra mile and began to reheat and slice them for us. Unfortunately my timing wasn't the best and most of us were too full of delicious food and drink to have room for dessert (also some people had to leave) so we ended up just giving each birthday person a whole pie to take home.All in all I felt like we had a positive experience. My only (minor) complaint is that my phone had some trouble recognizing the Toast QR code for ordering. Fortunately someone else at our table texted the link to me and it was fine. In the future I think it'd be helpful if the URL / link were displayed along with the QR code, but maybe it was and I just missed it? Oh also there were a few times when a condiment was missing or a drink took a while to come out, but it seemed like everyone was pretty swamped with work.tl;dr: good food, kind staff, would recommend, would visit again :)"

It's counter service and seat yourself, so it felt very easy to pop in for as little or long as you want. The interior is beautiful with abundant indoor and outdoor seating. The bathrooms were clean.We ran into trouble when we placed our order on the toast QR code.. the tech itself was great. Our glasses of wine came out in a reasonable amount of time. However the burger we ordered still hadn't come out in about 30 minutes, which thankfully our server noticed. However after that it still took another 30 minutes to get resolved... I want to give points to Edie Jo's because they ultimately did serve us a really delicious burger and gave us a free glass of wine and appetizer. The staff member seemed to genuinely feel bad, and wanted to make it right which went a long way with us. All in, I'd visit again!"

Then when I picked my cocktail eventually, I asked for extra ginger, just to be extra annoying. And he made me the nicest drink with a smile and the cocktail was amazing (it was the mezcal Paloma by the way.) Didn't get to try the food but heard their brunch is phenomenal.

2804,srqlsWg0od6soGI2Zf8mXA,6/21/2021,2 star rating,"Pros: indoor seating requires vaccination proof, which we appreciated. Cons: slow service and slow food preparation (50+min for my avocado toast). Super weak or lack of AC on a 90+ degree summer day. Additionally, waitress needs customer service training. She didn't give us water or silverware even when the food was there so we ended just grabbing plastic ones by the counter. Then when I asked about my avocado toast, she literally said ""I only have two hands"", which was beyond the point. Clearly I wasn't asking if she is an octopus, I was asking if it's ready.

The chai latte was perfectly spicy and easily one of the best I've had, although a bit expensive, in true NYC fashion. The egg and cheese omelette wasn't particularly memorable, and I hated the heaping mass of arugula it came with. I should've requested switching it with an alternate side, like the fries. My boyfriend's burger came with fries, and the accompanying rosemary garlic aioli was heavenly. One of the best aspects of this place is its payment process. Scanning the QR code on the table enabled us to place our own orders that we could ultimately pay for separately, but be served together as a party.I'd definitely come here again, but I'd either order something different or come for dinner."

2823,r5NT8-nV4py2c-mppTKucQ,10/5/2021,3 star rating,"For quite a few years I've been passing by this tiny spot that does Mexican street food. There's a plethora of eateries in this super busy area of the Lower East Side. What I've noticed about this place from all the times I've passed by is that it is usually a steady stream of customers ordering food. The menu is huge and has most of the typical Mexican street food you could imagine. The menu, although a bit overwhelming, is nicely laid out and pretty straightforward. As soon as I walked inside I already knew what I wanted. I've been on a ""birria taco"" kick lately so I went with the quesabirria tacos. For those who aren't familiar, Birria is a traditional Mexican dish from the state of Jalisco. The dish is meat stew traditionally made with goat meat but most popularly made with beef in the United States. There's no dine-in area nor are there any outside tables. My order of quesabirrias took a while (or maybe I was just that hungry). It came with consommé. Although I enjoyed the quesabirria tacos, they weren't the best I've ever had. I think I enjoyed the consommé a little more than I did the tacos. However, I would give this place another shot and try something different."

If you're interested in seeing what all of the hype is about, I'd recommend booking in advance or ordering takeout during the early afternoon hours - I stopped by once in the evening and they were so busy they couldn't accommodate a to-go meal. This time around, I had a reservation, and although my friend and I had to wait a few minutes to be seated upon our arrival, the service thereafter was relatively quick.The restaurant offers an extensive beer and wine list, as well as a zesty Yuzu Ginger cider. The menu only features a single vegan option, and fortunately it did not disappoint. The Kang Kluay, a yellow curry with kabocha squash and banana, wasn't very spicy, but it didn't have to be, because its flavor was great. The banana chunks somewhat resembled potatoes in taste and texture, likely because they absorbed the curry and eliminated the fruit's sweetness. The kabocha squash pieces were much smaller and didn't make much of an impression, but the basil leaves made it feel like more of a traditional curry.It would be nice if Ugly Baby had more vegetarian and vegan-friendly items on their menu, but the banana curry was so unique that I wouldn't mind eating it again in the future."

I like the cooking but the seasoning was off- Fried fish: Well fired though it should have been served with some seafood sauce or some fish sauce- Nam tok beef & tripe: The seasoning was awesome, and I like the spiciness and the pla ra flavor, but the steak was dull. It should have been either cooked medium-rare or just really well-grilled like typical Thai style.The better dish of the night was Gang Som which was yummy but not enough to carry the whole dinner."

Beautiful eclectic setting, love the colors, the tightness, the plates. But the food, oh my. Make sure you load up on tums for prophylaxis. Thankfully the staff recommended different levels of spice for our dishes. The fish (no spice) was so crispy, mild in a very good way. This was my favorite dish and would totally get again.Next level up was the tiger shrimp with curry and egg. Egg was absorbed so well the curry and was a good step up in spice. But whoa boy the beef and tripe salad, that first bite was exquisite but painful. It's good that you can't eat too much, but you want to. Cucumbers for cooling is a must. I had to go back and finish the fish while I could still taste haha. But when I finally went back for round 2, the spice was more manageable - must have burned off some taste buds.I will definitely be back, so many dishes to try, great staff, chill environment, great selection of drinks. And definitely need to build up that spice tolerance"

The beef shank curry was my favorite, it had so much flavor and melted in your mouth. The tiger shrimp curry was delicious, had densely flavored omelette chunks as well, and was basically in a tom yum soup. So lucky we got seating! Would definitely come back. Service was also amazing, everyone was so kind, friendly, and attentive."

I grew up eating very spicy african food so I did have an issue with the spice level but I will say if you don't eat a lot of spicy food it will be very spicy for you.

We were a group of 3 and ordered 3 dishes and had plenty of leftovers.Our server patiently explained all the food items and what dishes would be degrees spicier. We shared the Pla Tod Kamin, Kang Som, and Nam Tok. The food had strong bold flavors and the Nam Tok was definitely one of the spicier dishes I've had.  Thankfully it came with a lot of lettuce, cabbage, and cucumber to combat the spice. I enjoyed the Kang Som the most. It was a great combination of sweet, sour and spicy and was nice to go back when I needed a break from the other spicier dish.It's a little on the pricey side but if you really like spicy food I'd recommend a visit."

Its amazing how you can eat a certain dish and it's so spicy, the you try another dish and it's also spicy, but a different kind of spice, then another dish which hits even more differently than the others. It's an incredible scaffolded spice journey I've been lucky enough to experience a few times. The service is great and the vibe and fun and energizing. There is usually a line of folks waiting and every table is usually full for good reason. I would definitely recommend calling ahead and making a reservation. You can also order for pickup and delivery."

The flavors are definitely very unique. The price was definitely on the pricier side but for the portion it's quite large. I definitely tasted the culture and the authenticity was great. Do keep in mind some items do run out during the day so arriving early is a bonus. When I went they were missing a few dishes that I wanted to try but had to order something else cause it was out. 8/10 would come here for the flavor and the urge to try more things but for the wait and the price I might have to consider it. Also, the menu changes from time to time which is great. Can really try other things if you want."

As spice fiend who has been on the search for a dish to actually challenge my spice tolerance, this place has got me beat - especially the notorious Laab Ped (duck salad) where you can make your own lettuce/cabbage/cucumber wraps with the spicy duck that got me sniffling a little. Another must-get is the Salted Egg Yolk Squid for your fill of savory, creamy seafood that isn't too spicy, which made it a good counterpart. Portions here are decently sized and the menu offers so many things I didn't get to try so you will for sure catch me here in the future ugly-tearing-up (in good way) to another spicy dish."

When you walk in, you gotta appreciate their decor because it all looked pretty cool. To start, we all ordered some cocktails, which were all tasty and not too strong. For appetizers, we ordered calamari, brussel sprouts, and mac & cheese. The brussel sprouts were roasted to perfect crispiness and I liked that they added little bits of bacon. The mac & cheese was delicious and cheesy. The calamari was good, but I wouldn't say it was amazingly special. For entrees, we got seafood orzo, their burger, and lamb rib chops. All of the entrees had a lot of flavor and they all tasted great, but the portions were pretty small for the price. Overall, I think this spot is perfect for a casual dinner, but be prepared for a higher price for the bill."

I wanted the guava mojito that was on the menu, however, the bartender said it was not available so he offered to make a lychee one. It was very sweet and tasted nothing like lychee, but it was suitable for my taste. He made my friend a sweet drink that she requested, it was pretty good, tasted like Luden's candy in drink form.  The cookies on the dessert menu sounded really good, and the bartender said it was made with Belgian chocolate, which sounded intriguing so I couldnt resist. It was mediocre cookies at best, i certainly could have made better chocolate chip cookies, and tasted nothing like Belgian chocolate. I think i had very high expectations for that. The cookie was a bit dry and crumbly."

This place boasts a full and long counter seating bar as well as a spacious dining area; larger groups are welcome. Saw the sign that the outdoor patio is open! (June 2022). I didn't check it out since it was a Saturday night and my kids were with me. Didn't want to kill the vibe.We were seated inside by the wall of music artists and iconic photos. It was so interesting for both my kids and I, to see the photos of another time. Musicians they've heard of for the most part and the history behind some of these icons. As we waited for our food, that was the topic of the night.Appetizers rocked! We had the roasted bone marrow with the caramelized onions and toast to start. Only comment, when digging out the marrow, there was so much grease/very oily. Like leaking off the plate. Made quite a mess on the table. Just know it's a messy dish.Then we had the burrata with apricot and prosciutto to follow. Very balanced dish and the apricots were beautifully presented. We enjoyed both very much. (Do note: the menu changes seasonally from what I understand so do not be surprised that half of the photos you see on Yelp, these items are no longer there). For ex: we wanted the meatballs but that was not on the menu at all. Entrees: the Mac and cheese with four cheeses was good. This was really a  savory dish.  A fellow cheese fan will agree, it's a lovely match of flavors. The bacon bits were a great touch to complete this dish.Another stand out entree was the lamb rib chops. Paired with feta and pita, as well as hummus and grilled broccolini. I've never had this kind of a pairing before but it worked. Lamb chops were beautifully cooked (although we were not asked how we preferred it).And I had the bacon gruyere burger with deluxe fries. (Extra $) These deluxe fries were excellent - gravy and melted cheese. Sinfully delicious. I'm glad I ordered it that way.  The burger at first look didn't look impressive just kind of regular. It was however, very delicious and while the waiter did ask how I wanted it cooked; it didn't come out as such (it was medium and not medium rare). I didn't comment since I just wanted to eat. And it tasted fine at any rate.Note: soda and water are the only non-alcoholic drinks here it seems (maybe one or two juice options) but no iced tea. I ended up ordering a cocktail to start. I very much enjoyed my ""je ne sais quoi"". The lemon and lime flavors complimented the oregano and pineapple infused 1800 reposado. I saw the bar churn out some serious drinks. Didn't see my waiter much after I ordered. But we were well attended by someone else in regards to grabbing our plates and bringing out our food. I should mention there were three dessert options but no one could eat anymore. One kiddo ordered the vanilla bean ice cream, one scoop so they accommodated us on that. Overall good eats here!"

This could be the locale for my  daughters sweet 16 dinner in February.  We ordered a multitude of appetizers and the plates were cleared well before our entrees arrived. We wet our palate with bottled still water. Myself and the future celebrant ordered ribs with a side of tater tots for me and French fries for she. The serving size is outstanding as I could not finish and subsequently shared.Everyone from my twelve year old with a particular palate was happy with the cuisine.

I previously went to a fun event here and decided I wanted to support this place bc it's new and I decided to have date night here and I completely regret it. To start, I ordered the ribs and it came with no side, NOTHING. Just ribs on a plate. The sauce was very sweet and the ribs had all fat on them. For $24 they could have included some sort of small side, something to cut the sweetness of the rib sauce. I also would have appreciated a heads up that my entree does not come with a side, I would have definitely ordered something else. Luckily, my husband ordered the burger and that was pretty good (I tried it)  it came with a side of fries and a small salad. It was also cheaper than my meal. Sigh. Someone needs to look into the menu. The cocktails were decent but be AWARE you'll be charged an additional tax on your food AND drinks. I've attached the receipt bc it still doesn't make sense that a $15 drink (labeled as such on the menu) came out to be almost. $18. I asked one of the bartenders about this and he had no idea. I will not return unfortunately and I beg you guys  be sure to check your bill before paying. To clarify the ribs are $22 on the menu but we were charged $24.96 like why!"

I explained to her it was waaay too salty, it was inedible.  She refunded me my money for the quac since I had to pay extra for it  - which I did appreciate.  Note to whoever manages this location, guacamole is such a simple and beautiful thing when done right:  Mashed avocados,  fresh cilantro, diced red onion, fresh lime juice and pinch of salt, - NOT SALTY TO THE THREAT of raising a customer's high blood pressure.

The picture of the steak above us was nothing like she was served. Her steak looked worse than dog food. I tasted it and it was dry, flavorless mush. On top of that, her salad bowl had wet lettuce leaves as big as her face. They practically served whole lettuce leaves. The only part of her meal she enjoyed was the soda on the side. Please save your money and go to an autorice spot instead or even Dos Toros. They know how to make a good steak."

Great selection of beverages and snacks. Even greater selection of board games along the back wall  if sports are just not your jam. Outdoor seating is also available, for which a tv often times gets brought out.You won't find yourself eating healthy here, but who goes to a bar for a salad, amiright? I am actually quite fond of the steak and bell pepper spring rolls, which are huge and satisfying. I actually find myself craving these from time to time, which I can't say about many bar menu items elsewhere. My recent Union Grounds discovery is their Trivia Night on Tuesdays at 8pm. My team is embarrassingly terrible and came in dead last place to no one's surprise, but it was still a fun way to end a Tuesday. Don't snooze on the $10 frozen spicy margs and $3 chicken taco specials.With yet another football season quickly approaching, I am definitely looking forward to hanging out at Union Grounds way too often for way too long. Go Jags!"

I've lived in NYC for 9 years and been quite underwhelmed with the options for bars that show sports and their food. This place checks all the boxes. On top of that, the bartender is one of the best in the business. I think his name is Vinnie or Vincenzo. He's always on point and attentive. If I lived closer I'd go here multiple nights a week"

So that's great, but it's also just the beginning of why I'm such a fan.The food is outstanding. Philly Cheese Steak rolls are delicious - one order is a great snack for two and is only $8. The bratwurst hot dog is also quite satisfying. The fries are nice and crispy. All these items can then be washed down with any number of their well-priced and ice cold beers.Service is also top-notch and friendly. The gentleman running the show (think he's the owner) is always hustling and goes out of his way to make his customers feel appreciated. Everyone is welcome at Union Grounds and the atmosphere is awesome. Also, they have plenty of fun board and card games to play!So happy this establishment is back open post-COVID and can't wait to watch some football games there this fall."

If I can be torn away from my glorious couch and the modern marvel that is NFL RedZone, I want to be at a place like Union Grounds.1. It has solid wings, and all the fried things (chicken sandwiches, chicken fingers, and like seven different types of spring rolls) I shouldn't eat, but want to eat on Football Sundays. 2. It has all the games on their own TV, and the sound on for the Jets and the Giants (flipped over to a sweet 90s soundtrack during the commercials, which I appreciate because I love the 90s, and hate commercials).3. Although the tap selection isn't really much worth mentioning, if I'm going to drink beer for 6-7 hours during the day, I'm going for the $16 pitchers of Bud Light every time, or I'm not going to make it home anyway.4.

Maybe 2013 or so). It's a lot different now, to be sure.  The only thing that I miss, really, is the extensive menu selection that the older iteration had.  Don't get me wrong, the food isn't terrible.  From time to time, however, I'd like to order an actual entree or, even, a cobb salad or something.  You can only eat hot dogs, burgers, and nachos so many times.  I remember you guys having bacon-wrapped dates and was stoked about that, because I make them all the time at home.  That being said, I do like the chicken caesar salad. Not so much a fan of the sliders, but I understand that they fill a niché, so I have no problem with 'em.If the owners ever read this, please think about extending the menu a little bit. Thanks!"

We came on a Saturday to watch some college football. Fortunately, they tuned into the game I was hoping to see. Good selection of drafts at the bar. I think there are about ten craft beers on tap.

For folks who frequent bars like this, a friendly constant at the door is always great to have. Then you have establishments like this divey shit hole who employs rude douchebags as door people. Seems like they found their bouncer through a Craigslist help wanted post. Long story short, I was having drinks with a couple of friends, stepped outside for a few minutes and when I tried to come back in, he just wouldn't let me in. I told him I just came out from inside, we have a tab open and two friends at the bar and he said ""I don't remember you and you're not going back in"". No rhyme or reason. Just a shit attitude. Don't come here unless you want to be treated like crap by a disgusting bouncer in an overcrowded bar. I had to text my friends to tell them to close the tab because the bouncer wouldn't let me back in. What a joke! Let's add this bar to the list of permanent closures due to the pandemic!

This is my first Yelp review but I feel compelled to complain about the rudest bartender I've ever encountered. We sat down at noon (in a relatively empty bar) and more than half of our group ordered drinks. We hadn't been there longer than 10 minutes before the bartender came over and essentially berated us for taking up a table when some of us weren't drinking. Told us we ""shouldn't be in a bar if we aren't drinking"", despite the fact that six of us were. Told us we all had to ""get a drink or get out"". Our party immediately finished our drinks and left and will never return because of the interaction. Absolute miserable human being.P.S. He didn't kick out the man who was eating a sandwich off of the floor and watching porn in the corner, so I guess that's just the preferred clientele for this shithole"

I was meeting up with a friend who said he was chilling here. Somehow he managed to get a table in the back room. This place is super packed and rowdy!Seems to have a decent selection of standard beers at standard New York prices. Nothing special. Is it weird that I was tempted to give the Spring Lounge an extra star for quality people watching? Everyone is so attractive in this part of New York.

It's affordable, but I don't visit this bakery as much as I visit a bakery on 8th ave, right by my house. The one I visit is $1 for everything, while Savory Bakery is $1.25 for the same item.

I've had their Savoy breakfast, it was fresh and delicious. The pork bun was to die for, as fresh as can be. I also tried their chicken salad, the chicken was grilled on the spot with the freshest greens, which included cilantro at the time. I came back for a desert, I chose the Tres Leches pineapple cake.

The staff is usually friendly, but sometimes I have been in here and they took their sweet time to ask me what I wanted. My final complaint is the coffee cups they use for tea are relatively small. Maybe it's just me, but they seem to be 6 ounce cups instead of 8 ounce cups, which is the norm for a small cup of tea/coffee."

We eat organic food 100% of the time at home, so traveling usually requires us to make compromises we'd rather not. We decided to see what was nearby and pulled up Google Maps: when we saw Burger Village was all organic, we got excited and stopped in for a bite.My husband had a beef burger in a collard wrap with the ""make a mess"" toppings and absolutely loved it. I ordered the Asian kale salad without cheese to make it vegan, as I didn't feel hungry enough for a burger. The menu was very well marked with what is vegan, gluten free, etc. For folks who do eat meat there is a wide selection (beef, chicken, deer, pork, bison, etc.). They also have a substantial vegan burger menu, which is always nice to see.They also have an organic drink selection (sodas, iced teas), in addition to carrying beer and wine. My husband really liked their black tea. I had a pint of beer to go along with my Asian salad.When we came in to sit down we were the only ones in the joint (it was 1:30 pm on a Thursday). Our server, a Turkish gentleman, was very nice. I will say that for being the only folks in the place the service was at a rather leisurely pace. We were on vacation and had no where to be, so it didn't bother us at all, but I would not be surprised if local frequent visitors didn't think it was quick enough.My husband liked his burger so much he ordered another one to go to take on our plane flight home with us the next day.Overall giving this place five stars because we both really enjoyed our food, and because we always support places with organic food on their menus.

I was not particularly adventurous sticking with a standard beef burger, but I found it to be decent. However, I was disappointed by the uncoordinated service and I was not a  fan of the sides we ordered.Quality: The menu at Burger Village is a little odd. I appreciate that they stress organic burgers, but the emphasis on different types of animal meat rather than unique burger topping combinations felt weird. I stuck with the standard Village Beef Burger and I ordered it with the Superior Choice option, even though the individual ingredients were cheaper. It was a good burger, a little over-done for medium rare, but I liked the meat and the signature sauce. I wasn't crazy about the Frings, the combination of french fries and onion rings. The fries were soggy and both items were very salty.Quantity: Decent sized burger and a massive bowl of fries and onion rings.Value: $13 for the Superior Choice Village Beef Burger. $8 for the Frings.Ambiance: We visited the Burger Village in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Located on a corner, it has a very large space, both inside and out. They have an outdoor deck, which may have been too cold during our visit, but would be great for nice days. Inside they have a bunch of tables spread across the bright space. A few televisions hung in different corners, showing both football and basketball on Sunday afternoon.Crowd: A few families grabbing lunch on a gusty Sunday afternoon.Service: Our waiter was very kind, but the service was a mess.

The portions were generous however, and if I was in the area I might come back."

We happened to be walking around looking for food while in the area and stumbled upon this place. What a great find. The inside of the restaurant smelled like disinfectant (not bad but not something I want to smell while eating) so we sat outside. The tacos are very well seasoned and very juicy  and these tortillas are STUFFED. The frozen margarita was average nothing to write home about. I will definitely be back for more tacos.

I didn't get to try the chicken tacos but the chicken quesadilla was pretty darn good. They packed it with a very generous amount of chicken. Also, the guacamole was very fresh and refreshing. It's a must try!We ordered through DoorDash. Delivery took a very long time but this isn't a reflection on the establishment. I think we got a slow driver."
