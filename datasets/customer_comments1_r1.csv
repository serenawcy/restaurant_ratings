The tofu was crispy and the broccoli was seasoned so very well - wonton soup - this one was disappointing just because it wasn't my preferred style of wonton soup, it was a broth that was thickened with cornstarch and had a lot of egg in it, so was not my favorite. However, the wontons were good!Overall, I would (and probably will) order from here again!"

2,a-hVnSTC12MY5L3t9yOSJw,3/25/2022,1 star rating,Waited for 30 minutes and ask everyone at the counter when they can take the order. No one replied and kept talking to each other. And I'm the only one at the store too. No line. LolWorst service ever. I don't know how they are surviving in Astoria with that kind of service
3,a-hVnSTC12MY5L3t9yOSJw,5/18/2021,4 star rating,"I like this place for American Chinese food. My favorites are the pork egg roll, followed by the sweet and sour chicken. I also enjoy more authentic Chinese foods from other places, like soup dumplings, pan-fried pork buns, hand-pulled noodles, dry-fried green beans, Peking duck... But sometimes I'm craving the kind of American Chinese food I used to get when I was younger. This place really hits the spot for that. I usually order enough so I can get two meals, because it all reheats well (egg rolls and chicken in oven, rice in microwave, sauce in hot water). This is my go-to when I get these cravings! I've been guilty if ordering two days in a row & having it for lunch and dinner both days... No shame!"
4,a-hVnSTC12MY5L3t9yOSJw,4/12/2022,3 star rating,Food is great. Kind of upset they changed the minimum price for online orders 2 $15. Unfortunately there isn't anything there I would spend $15 on at one time. So I guess you guys being greedy just cost you my frequent purchases of items costing around $13. I order there at least 5 times a week. No longer will. Do the math. (5x52)x $13 or $3380 is less than $15 apparently using your logic. Smh. Whoever made this decision needs to step down from making decisions. I'm certain I'm not the only person who feels this way.

I went downstairs to get my food to only find out that the driver was not outside. I then proceed to go back upstairs. When i got inside i received another call saying he was outside i told him to then come upstairs. He then said come down or you dont get your food. I called the store after that then they to but in nicer words said if you dont go down AGAIN you will not get your food. I then told the guy to cancel the payment and he hung up on me. Poor delivery service

A bit less expensive than another location only a couple blocks up.Cleanest seating I've seen in a Chinese restaurant so if you want to sit there you can too.

The place is small but cozy, the Mexican guy at the counter was very nice. The tacos (al pastor and with carnitas) were VERY good. Guacamole also quite good. The chicken quesadilla wasn't as great as the tacos, but still good.On the whole, if not EXACTLY as in Mexico, I think that for being in Brooklyn it is a great spot for quite authentic Mexican food!"
12,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,11/5/2022,2 star rating,"Today I was in a Park Slope mood and decided on another gorgeous fall day to walk around the neighborhood and soak it up. I was also in a taco mood thus , Yelp suggested  some good ideas especially for places that offered lunch specials: Miti Miti  offered but sounded like too much food as my appetite really wanted snack. I'll have to visit them in the future.Gueros on Prospect wasn't opened til 5 so that was ruled our. Nacho Macho appeared and I checked the photos and reviews and decided to give it a try.So, as you can see by my rating they garnered two stars.So let's talk about what they got right first:1. Extensive menu options. 2. Out door seating was comfy3. Lunch specials are a good value: chips and salsa, can of soda and two tacos....Which leads me to their opportunities:1. Posting pricing on social media should be reviewed and updated consistently. Thus, the lunch specials are not $10 but $11.25 plus tax 2. Post signs in your restaurant that states prices vary by selection: I selected shrimp tacos for the special and was told seventy five cents extra. Hmmm.. Which brought my total to $13 but there is a three taco special for $13....3.. if one is dining  in or out, putting chips in a paper bag with side salsa really isn't the way to go. The bag got greasy and I don't want to sound uppity but the chips could have been placed in a small basket.Now for the food:Chips and salsa were good, the salsa had a really nice kick.The shrimp tacos were bland and I  really was disappointed, no sauce no kick.. the size of the shrimp were nice.No straw for can of soda?? If it's bussing my own table state it.Well, Miti Miti for $19 lunch special and more food would have probably been a better choice."

What I've tried: - grilled portobello: this is just so flavorful and heavy. It's definitely my favorite burrito - breakfast burrito- scrambled eggs, potatoes and cheese. There's more potato to eggs ratio so it would be nice if it was balanced but otherwise flavors are remarkable and seasoned well. I topped it off with some hot sauce and green avocado sauce and it was delicious. Delivery is always quick!"

I ordered the steak torta and fish taco. I preferred the torta. My friend ordered a chicken quesadilla. Portions were huge!! We probably could have split one dish but I had no problem finishing it all. Service was quick. Seating is tight inside but they also have outdoor seating."

Big portions, I often save it for two meals, fresh ingredients and I'm a big fav of their spicy chipotle chicken. Quesadillas are also a go to. All in all very good for a quick bite."

I decided to eat at one of the many tables that were available and thoroughly enjoyed the soft bun filled with a tasty red bean paste.  Hours later I would enjoy the egg salad sandwich on the train to NJ.  Everything was tasty and a great value.

24,9dqJrTzx0GvBNb-J0VyeGg,1/23/2022,2 star rating,Strawberry cake* - is delicious but I found a freakin eye lash on one of the slices I had ordered.Door Dash price $6.75 per slice. I photographed the good piece in the photos. Still gave this other slice a chance and the cake is very fluffy. It's not super sweet and it's very creamy. The strawberries on-top and inside of the cake are very fresh and taste yummy.Do I recommend this location? Only if the location seems clean enough. Kind of scared to order again.

We also ordered their Gyoza, not bad at all. But the tacos were definitely better. Music? eh. (there's no real set mood, you are bound to hear ANYTHING). The drinks were okay, could be better. Not many options for theirs cocktails. They were also a bit pricey, in my opinion. Decent place for a quick, calm good time with friends or a spouse."

For apps I really liked the portion of mini tacos which is great for sharing and as usual wings are always a win.The fries and burger were pretty standard and filling. I was surprised by one of their cake slices that was very tasty and flavorful compared to the other two kinds. The chocolate was the best and richest.Service was nice, the lady who handled our party of 7 was really patient with us and made sure we got everything.The ambience is pretty relaxed and the back area is really nice and much more open than the front area.

A few of them can also be very sweet which isn't what I was into but the Goldrush cocktail was my jam. It had a nice subtle hint of honey and a delicious bourbon kick. The appetizers I had were fantastic. My favorite were the sliders. It was cooked to a nice medium rare and felt very filling. It wasn't one of those flat pattie sliders, this had a good bite to it. Mini tacos were very crunchy and gobbled up in one bite. Onion rings were also very satisfying. I had a burger for the main entree and it was a hefty one. It's definitely a solid burger. I was only able to finish half unfortunately. The burger, weirdly was over done. I expected it to be the same perfect doness as the sliders but was slightly disappointed. Nonetheless it was a great experience!"

Overall, they were pretty standard bar food. Only the Mini Chicken Tacos stood out to me.I also got an order of the Buffalo Chicken Wrap ($16) for my entree. I could have done without the celery."

Good luck sitting there for more than a few minutes. The storefront is on a corner that has NO shade at all. Might as well be at the beach. There is a massive awning that management refuses to use. That's the reason you can walk by the store on a sweltering day and see NO ONE there. They're all at Hungry Ghost across the other corner of the street. That coffee shop has so much shade they need no awning. There's also air conditioning AND a bathroom inside. Same with the Starbucks across from Connecticut Muffin. Given the awning problem, there is no compelling reason to ever visit that Connecticut Muffin. If they go out of business, they've earned it for being so shortsighted and inconsiderate."

Somebody almost came in with a key while I was using it. The prices are about as high as you expect from a decent coffee shop, maybe a little lower, but everything about the place feels really low quality. The napkins are rough, the hand dryer in the bathroom doesn't work. It feels like the place is a month away from closing down."

It is the only place in the neighborhood that I have found to not only have decaf iced coffee but also a flavored one! The hazelnut flavoring is not too sweet so it is just right. They have sandwiches to bagels to pastries. There is also a fairly large area for benches in front of the restaurant that is partly shielded by their awning to sit and eat. On a nice day, it is great for sitting outside and sipping your drink or eating breakfast while people or car watching. It is across the street from a school and the school's playground so it is a convenient place to stop by after the playground and get a snack or a drink. The prices are comparable to neighborhood coffee shops."

There is no lo mein, no soups, just the rice and the mains.  But this strategy works well for them, keeping service super fast and prices affordable for the lunch crowd.For $7.25, I got the General Tsos lunch combo with pork fried rice. The chicken was crispy and the sauce was delicious. The rice was just fine. I was in and out of the shop in under 10 minutes. Make sure to bring cash, it is cash only. The fried chicken seemed to be a popular choice as many of the other customers today ordered it, and I noticed a large platter of wings in the kitchen ready to be served up. I wish the lunch combo included a soda or something but this is still a good deal for the upper west side. Will be back when my next craving for saucy chicken strikes."

The person taking my order didn't really acknowledge me , just stood there until I said something and then another worker came from behind the counter and basically knocked me over trying to get by instead saying excuse me.Very rude ! However I was hungry and it was the only place for a few blocks. I ordered chicken wings and fries and it took only a few minutes so I didn't have to wait long. They only take cash so I had to use their ATM which charges $1.75 They only allow one person in the restaurant at a time to ensure social distancing so that was good. When my order was ready, I asked for a knife. They had none. I asked for hot sauce packers. They had none. I asked for ketchup packets. They had none .But they will our hot sauce and ketchup ON your food if you ask.Needless to say when I got in, my food was so good. And I would have given more stars if it wasn't for the service !"

Despite the almost club-staurant style, the food is the star and the reason to visit Hutong.Quality: Walking in I was a bit concerned it may be a place that focuses on style over substance, but was happy to find that was not the case. Each dish looks great, but there was not a single item I would skip. The Dim Sum dishes and the Roasted Peking Duck With Pancakes were the stars. However, the Hutong Dan Dan Noodles was a personal favorite. Cocktails are pricey, but delicious, and our Bao & Soy Milk dessert was a great conclusion.Quantity: Small plates and dim sum, better to share.Value: $22 for the Comfortably Numb Cocktail. $22 for the Wagyu Beef Millefeuille. $22 for the Crystal Lobster Dumplings. $18 for the Yu Xiang Crispy Pork Dumpling. $56 for the Roasted Peking Duck With Pancakes. $15 for the Fried Noodles. $14 for the Hutong Dan Dan Noodles. $17 for the Bao & Soy Milk.Ambiance: Hutong has a massive space located in Midtown East. It took two tries to get to the correct entrance, which is at the center of this caved out building. They occupy a huge area, which seems even larger because of the ridiculously high ceilings. The dining area is separated from the bar, and both have an upscale club vibe. The booths are a bit annoying as the tables are not the proper size and guests end up far away from their dishes.Crowd: Reservations recommended even though it is a large space.Service: A weird experience as it felt like our server was trying hard to change our order. They seem to really want guests to only select their signature dishes, which begs the question of why not reduce the menu.Parking: Limited street parking."

63,qrncvjkiKN5Z-JC06ygy6A,2/17/2023,4 star rating,"I love duck and after hearing about this place from a friend, I knew I had to come here for my birthday. Found out they are a Michelin Star Restaurant too known for ""The Flaming Duck"" and they only accept 5 bookings per night starting at 5:30pm through 8:30pm. You have to do the prepaid ($160- up to 6 guests) online booking from Monday to Thursday (up to 14 days in advance). We got here a little early on a Sunday, and they were able to seat us while we waited for our friend. Besides the flaming duck, we ordered a whole Peking duck, which is served in 2 stages- with pancakes and stir-fry duck & green beans with lettuce leaf cups. We also got some Hutong Signature Dishes- the chilled green asparagus, prawn roll & red lantern (soft-shell crab) as well as the dan dan noodles. The flaming duck was the best we have ever had in terms of flavor, very little fat, cooked and sliced to perfection. That alone is quite pricey but definitely worth it, a must try! The Peking duck was also delicious except I didn't really like the second stage of it- I felt like there were too many green beans and not enough flavor. The asparagus was not bad either, the ends were coated with honey but there was way too much white sesame. Prawn roll was good. The dan dan noodles was silky, smooth and had just the right level of spiciness. Lastly, the soft-shell crabs were deep fried with dried whole chillies, so it had some extra kick as well. Portion size for all the dishes were decent, price was reasonable and the modern decor made it the perfect birthday dinner. Service was exquisite with servers always there to fill up our water cups without having to ask and giving us new plates. Our server, Terence was very helpful and attentive. The food came out lightning fast with a perfect pace to the next course. The Flaming Duck Experience was great and didn't take long. I would come back just for that. Best duck ever!"

The decor is nice here, instagram spot especially their entrance way with the wine bottles.In terms of food, it was a hit or miss with certain courses. My 2 stand outs were the flaming duck and the dessert (Bao and Soy Milk) both of which were my favorite dishes of the night. Some of the dishes that didn't hit the spot: chilled green asparagus and seasoned fried rice (this dish was super bland). For the fried rice, they didn't give us spoons or bowls which is hard to eat rice with plates and chopsticks. Cocktails were also a hit or miss and weren't consistent. Some of us ordered the same drinks and they looked/tasted different. My favorite 2 cocktails were: Magic Lamp and Vermilion Bird."

We arrived late to our reservation, so we appreciated that they promptly seated us, and we let them know that we had to leave in less than 1 hour.The food and service were good (4/5)- In summary, We shared the wagyu beef Millefeuille as an appetizer. My entré was the aromatic beef rib in lotus leaf and Chef's fried rice. My partner also had the Hutong Dan Dan noodles. - The wagyu beef Millefeuille was delicious, the highlight of the dinner (5/5) Crunchy outside, and the meat was tender inside. Also, the meat had a touch of spicy. I would eat 10 of those at once, but the platter only had 3. - The aromatic beef rib in lotus leaf is big enough for two people, but the menu did not indicate it. The meat was tasty and very tender. The sauce on the side was ok, nothing special. - Chef's fried rice was dry, and I won't recommend it. - Hutong Dan Dan noodles did not impress me, but my partner enjoyed the spicy and the broth.- My cocktail was the Magic Lamp, and it was refreshing. The presentation could improve. Overall, the ambiance of Hutong was appealing and attractive. At times, I thought music wasn't playing. Then I would listen to the music in the background. So it is easy to have a conversation without yelling at each other. I would recommend Hutong for small bites, and the ambience. I might consider going back to try other items on the menu."
67,qrncvjkiKN5Z-JC06ygy6A,12/13/2022,2 star rating,"I don't know where to begin. Let's just say I was very disappointed. So many people spoke highly of this place and my expectations did not reflect my experience.I had a 9:30 reservation and 1/3 people in my party arrived on time. I'll admit, the other 2 including myself arrived about 15 minutes later. You would think their grace period allotted for a 15 minute grace period then you'd immediately be sat down. That was not the case. Unfortunately we arrived and waited 45 minutes before we sat down. Granted, we took pictures in the meantime (in their beautiful hallway that was monitored closely by their security guard that can make one feel very uncomfortable AND you have a 2 minute time limit to take photos).... This is first time I've ever heard of such a thing.Now we finally sit down and greeted by 1 person that turned out NOT to be our waiter. We must've met about 3 different servers/helpers/kitchen aids. The food came out very quickly and the temperature was perfect. I was so excited to eat their peking duck but was GRAVELY disappointed to see how much OIL AND GREASE followed each piece. Now all of us fuck eaters know what we're signing up for when we order duck - it's fatty and tasteful. Their version was just GREASE. I couldn't even finish it. I'm not sure if they rushed it because we were the last seating of the night but it was not what I wanted.Now towards the end of our meal we're ready for the bill. One of the 3 gentlemen that assisted us came over but ignored me and then proceeded to switch his attention to the other party behind us. No big deal. We just wish he came back sooner so we can get out of there and go home. We didn't get a good look at the bill but just paid quickly. Fast forward a few days later I reached out to them to request a copy of the bill. It legit took them 5 days to send me a PDF of the bill. I've spoken to 3 different people, and they were the least bit helpful with the exception of one hostess with a French accent. Thank you to them!Ultimately, the bar tenders are nice, the food is a solid 7/10 minus the duck and the drinks are tasteful. I didn't enjoy my experience and wish I got the experience I pictured to celebrate my birthday. And I wish we were treated with royalty like I've seen with other clients. Just not my cup of tea."

Since we were doing ""family-style"", he made sure we would get the best bang for our buck. We ordered: - wagyu millefeuille, excellent! Must get! - dim sum platter sampler, came with shrimp dumplings, lobster dumplings, veggie and fish - shrimp spring rolls - Peking duck (this came with thin wraps which I was very impressed with! Usually I've had Peking duck with so thick wraps, but this was perfect!) - lettuce wraps that came with the Peking duck - sea bass with noodles, delicious and spicy! All of the dishes we ordered were made delicately and delicious. Enjoyed every part of this meal and will absolutely return, and definitely for the Peking duck!!"

But, my friends, the search has come to an end, for I have found a slice of heaven at Nolita Pizza in NYC. This humble pizza joint has won my heart and stomach, and I couldn't be more excited to share my experience with you.First off, let's address the elephant in the room: the long lines. To some, a queue might be a deterrent, but to me, it's an unmistakable sign of greatness. Nolita Pizza's legendary reputation precedes it, and the line of hungry patrons is a testament to the scrumptiousness that awaits within. Don't worry; the wait is well worth it.As you step inside, you're greeted by the warm, friendly faces of the staff, making you feel like a part of their pizza-loving family. The scent of freshly baked dough wafts through the air, further whetting your appetite. And then, you're faced with the toughest decision of your life: which slice to choose?Nolita Pizza offers an ample selection of mouthwatering choices, from classic Margherita to more unique options like Grandma Rosemarie and Formaggio Bianco. Each slice is a culinary masterpiece in its own right, making it near-impossible to pick just one. But fear not, you can always come back for more.The quick service at Nolita Pizza is truly impressive, considering the crowd they serve. The staff has mastered the art of moving customers through the line at lightning speed while still taking the time to ensure everyone feels welcomed.Now, let's talk about the most important part: the pizza itself. Served warm and fresh out of the oven, each slice is an explosion of flavor that simply must be experienced to be believed. The crust is just the right thickness, with a satisfying crunch that complements the melty, gooey goodness of the cheese and toppings. And the sauce? Don't get me started on the sauce - it's the perfect balance of tangy and sweet, tying the entire slice together.The price point at Nolita Pizza is average for NYC, and in my opinion, it's an absolute steal considering the quality of the pizza you're getting. So, whether you're a local or a tourist, do yourself a favor and grab a slice - or three - at Nolita Pizza. Trust me, it'll be a decision you won't regret."

The most CRISP and flavorful bite of a pizza slice I've ever had. I can taste the fresh basil and olive oil. And as other reviewers said, the slices are large. For this price in soho, I'd come back here over any other of the pizza spots. Super friendly staff and outdoor seating. Generous toppings. Next time I'd try the pepperoni (real ones, the small circular pop up ones vs the cheap flat fake ones). There's so many toppings you can't even see the pizza :)  ciao!"

Well not many. There is another place on Junction but it actually taste better here. We had the steak and eggs, wonton soup and the fried pork chops. I am not keen on the wonton soup but he rest of it was good. The atmosphere is devoid but that is not what I am here for. I can sit down and have a conversation without much people bothering me and there is almost no chance of me running into anyone I know. It's not annoyingly loud here. Would I come back? If I was in the neighborhood, yes for sure. Would I come on purpose...I don't know. I would come I suppose over some other places. They just have to work on getting your order correct!!!

The asian employees speaking Spanish to all of the locals is when I knew I had chosen the right place.I fell in love with this restaurant when I was first introduced to it about 3 years ago and why it stands as my favorite neighborhood local restaurant is because of the unique deep flavors each dish has. The quality and flavor of the food is the exact same as it was throughout the years and that is also very important to me. I personally how they incorporate garlic/onions in some of their dishes and they have really perfected the recipe. Here are the things I have been getting that never ceases to amaze me-1. Grilled Pork Chop - The garlic sauce that is poured over this grilled pork chop is BEYOND me and grilled to perfection2. Sauteed Shrimp with Vegetables - Shrimp cooked to a perfect texture with sauteed vegetables3. Broiled Fish - Can not emphasize enough that they know exactly how long to cook their proteins with this out-of-body experience garlic sauce4. Pork Fried Rice (sounds generic but the taste is unreal, just trust me on this one)5. Broccoli with garlic sauce - Again, the garlic sauce sauteed with broccoli is BEYOND ME6. Homemade iced tea - crack, trust me on this one7. Iced Coffee - Colombian coffee (dark and sweet)"

Nothing special and frankly there's no reason to go here over other nearby spots.But the real reason Patron is terrible is that it's a magnet for trouble. In their outdoor dining, they have people constantly getting into fights and screaming matches. Cops have to come break up fights between customers *multiple times a week*. I don't know how, but they must attract every single obnoxious tool and sloppy drunk in the city. This is the only restaurant in the neighborhood that I wish would go out of business forever. Yesterday, two women rolling around pulling each other's hair in the bike lane, shrieking like hyenas... Patron customers. Two days before that, homeless guy and a Patron customer get into fist fight. Week before that, some couple's drunken screaming match lasting half an hour... Patron customers. And so on.They apparently have no plan to fix this because it's been like this for years. Go somewhere else that has actual good Mexican food and won't put you at risk of getting tackled by a cop."

I also got a French toast bagel to try but froze it because I didn't have time to try it.The scallion and lox cream cheese both have nice flavor, and I thought there was a good amount of lox in the lox cream cheese.I was sad that they were sold out of bialys for my delivery order, but a very nice lady called and asked what I wanted as a replacement. I would order from here again!"

Truly, I love the assembly line here. The guys behind the food counter were really slicing, toasting, and slapping cream cheese on the bagel. Truly so efficient!!! I had the walnut cream cheese on a multigrain bagel. These guys really made my bagel within minutes. They were taking care of other orders besides mine but I just appreciate this assembly line though. One thing when ordering bagels though is that they always put wayyy too much cream cheese. Not Broad Nosh! It was just the right amount in my opinion. The walnut and raisin cream cheese was not overly sweet, but I couldn't taste the walnut flavor at all because of the raisins. The bagel itself was quite crunchy and thicker than some that I've had. Overall, solid bagels. I'm not mad at all cause ya know a bad bagel can really ruin your morning!!"

Got the thickest and fluffiest *Whole Wheat Everything Bagel (with lite cream cheese and tomato) * i've ever gotten. Not only was it so soft to bite into but also had a generous amount of cream cheese. Also ordered a *Create your Own Wrap (egg whites, spinach, broccoli, onions, shredded mozzarella in a whole wheat wrap), which was also filled with fresh ingredients and tightly wrapped so nothing fell out while eating. Usually go for cold drinks but decided to get the *Hot Spiced Chai (with skim milk)*. A great smooth, creamy warm drink with strong hints of cinnamon to wash down the food."
107,Fm2XUIqr62M6IznAS-kJBw,11/6/2022,1 star rating,"FREE COFFEE AND WATER POLICY - PLEASE READ:I have been going to Broad Nosh bagels for months, and I just learned yesterday that you are entitled to a free small coffee or water with any bagel purchase. This is neither printed on their menu, nor their website, and none of the staff makes any effort to communicate this to the customers.The only reason I found out was because my friend was asked by a short, female cashier with brown hair if he wanted a coffee or a water with his purchase. I was in front of my friend in line, and the short, brown-haired female cashier did NOT offer me the same deal.I have eaten at Broad Nosh Bagels no less than a dozen times over the last few months, and never once have any of the staff or cashiers mentioned the free small coffee or water bottle deal. Which leads me to begin to wonder why the cashier asks some customers if they want free water/coffee and not others.While my friend was able to enjoy his freshly made everything bagel with a bottle of free ice cold water, I was forced to pay nearly $4 for a bottle of Poland Spring in order to keep from choking on my crusty egg bagel.I just felt like others should know about this policy, and that Broad Nosh should be more consistent in communicating this to their patrons.1 star"

Stephanie was at the register. That had to be a blessing for the owners. She was so friendly and outgoing and pleasant to everybody on quite a long line. When it was my turn I wanted a bagel and some cream cheese and I was looking around for a little dessert and she gave me an apricot rugelach. No charge I should just taste it! It was excellent and I have been buying them by the package ever since,.She then turned me onto the Bialys. Haven't been able to find a really good one since my Brooklyn days. Another superb suggestion as I ordered eight to take home.Stephanie is who you need in the front of your business. She made me a customer."

Even some chives thrown in there, loved that surprise. It hit the spot. The almond milk latte was satisfying. Not my favorite latte in the city, but when I'm in the area and need a pick-me-up, it does the job.Personally, my experience with service here was great. Plus they have a cute lil patio out back.

It's very basic looking and frankly the reviews were just ok, and I'm pretty loyal to Muse close by. With that said - wow! So much better than expected. What turned me was that they have pineapple curry on the menu, one of my absolute favorite Thai dishes that you don't see on all menus. I decided to give it a shot and I'm so happy with it. It came piping hot with an excellent flavor - I will most certainly be ordering from Udom frequently from here on out!"
161,PiOv4vMRLaJJoqt_Eyebvw,3/2/2023,2 star rating,They fry fish items and chicken items in the same oil or pan. So unfortunately someone in my group couldn't even eat some of the food we ordered. We specifically asked in advance they said they cook everything separately but our chicken dishes tasted fishy. Everything had an overall watery taste it was so weird. The food is not good. The drinks are good and we came during happy hour so that was the highlight of the meal. I probably won't be back.

The Mongolian Beef...I thought I knew what it would taste like bc I've had it elsewhere and it was delicious...well let me be the first to say don't order this. I didn't rate them low because the dish wasn't good, it was what transpired after. So I get the dish and immediately I knew I made a mistake. It looked very weird, the beef and sauce was grayish, and there were all these crunchy noodles, I tasted it and was repulsed. So I called the waiter and told her how sorry I was, this actually has never happened to me before, so I didn't know what to do. I ordered something else and it tasted fine. Also the appetizers were good and everyone else liked their food. So the food is generally good. I just don't like that:1. They seemed personally offended that I didn't like the dish and the older lady who may be a manager or owner, not sure, but she was so nice to me in the beginning and then once this happened, she would walk pass my table and literally give me dirty looks. Just an awkward feeling to have for someone handling your food. I guess it's true what they say, don't return dishes back to the kitchen (or attempt to in my case). 2. They insisted I keep the dish and wrapped it up to go, but I told them I didn't like it lol. And they charged me for it at the end. I threw it away outside (sorry again). Yes I get it was my mistake for ordering it, but still a weird way to handle it from a management perspective. And that's why I wouldn't go back."

I tried the seafood fried rice during a previous visit and wanted to a bit more.  The rice is called something else but it under F6 if I recall correctly.  I also tried the fish cakes and they were delicious as well as the calamari.  Seasoned good and married perfectly with the sauces they are served with which both have a nice kick to them.The staff was pleasant.Enjoy!

With food so good it was worth two hours of back and forth walking, Ubering, and bussing to closed location after closed location, this is my now my new favorite place in Brooklyn and I will likely name my first child Udom.For real, the shrimp cakes were perfectly prepared, the Tom Kha soup was subtle enough while still being flavorful and satisfying. And this pineapple duck curry? Ooh-wee, this is as tasty as it is pretty.I look forward to coming back again and again and making a large catering order for baby Udom's christening, and invite all of you to join in the revelry by trying this place for yourself."

I found this little neighborhood gem within walking distance from my hotel and honestly, I am kind of happy things turned out the way it did. I ordered the lamb w/ rice platter and my travel partner chose the beef & chicken kofta plate. Wow! Just wow! The price, the quality, and the service was awesome. The place is very well lit and the menu makes it easy to order from. I think the only reason the 5th star was not awarded was there were no restrooms available to my knowledge and I felt the portions could have been a bit larger. Being from Los Angeles, we have similar places for the same price that can literally feed 2 people with leftovers. However, from the rice, the pita bread, the salad, white sauce, and green sauce, everything was on point. If you can't handle spicy, be careful when asking for the red and green sauce mix cause it's quite the burn. Given this place is open late (2am) per the sign, I hope to end up here 1 more time before my vacation is over"

The Mix Platter (chicken and lamb over rice) is tasty, but the fries can get soggy as they are overlaid on, instead of separated from, the rice. The fries get further moistened by any sauce drizzled on top of the rice.A challenge for Halal Boyz is that nearby (by car, anyway) establishments offer better flavor and value, and more consistent execution and service, albeit at slightly higher prices. I've received bits of bone in the food here. The rice is sometimes on the hard side. And while some customers receive sauce thimbles upon request, others don't."

I would occasionally even order it as delivery on busy workdays. But I just ordered the skinny sandwich/soup combo, and was shocked to see that only half a sandwich arrived. This combo costs $15, by the way.A ""skinny sandwich"" used to mean a sandwich on a regular roll, with some of the bread sliced away lengthwise to make it thinner. I had ordered this as recently as late September this year. I called in to ask why I only got half a sandwich and the person who picked up rudely said ""that's what you get, I talked to you already today, and it's been like that for a year."" This is the first time I had ever called in, so that wasn't true, and totally unnecessary attitude. I had also gotten a normal skinny sandwich in September, so something is wrong.Potbelly corporate, if you're reading this - never buying from you again. Good luck!"

I had never gone but I heard the dream bar was good (lol) - so I ended up stopping by for lunch. Ordered the half skinny sandwich (the wreck) on multigrain bread with Swiss and the broccoli cheddar soup. Everything was subpar, the sandwich was dry and the soup was super gummy and chunky- felt like it was straight from a can (which I'm sure most places are but this one in particular was not good...). The employees were not welcoming- it seemed like everyone there hated their jobs and you felt it. I waited a long time for my sandwich Bc of misdirection. The lady told me to step down after placing my order and so I did- no one was there - and the next step was to pay so I did that. ~7 min later a lady yelled at me saying I have to tell the guy what I want on the sandwich. (They could've told me that a long time ago). On top of that, I stood there at the ""order here"" counter and waited while two ladies talked to each other and looked at a phone- didn't acknowledge me at all until one said finally ""hold on while I handle this"".. to finally ask for my order."

The owner is almost always at the location and takes pride in his food and boy does it show. The lunch special is the thing to get (yes it's served day and night - more of a portion size then anything) try to 2 or 3 everything is good.

Your life is not valued here they just want your money this place will give people salmonella & food poisoning. I'm not a psychic but I can see a lawsuit in their future. The food is constantly in the open air where they talk over it.  The freezer where they keep the appetizers & desserts is the most filthiest I ever seen, it is to the point the dirt gets on the dessert containers & seeps inside, it's very repugnant & unsanitary, it will force you to gag into throw up mode. .if you ever see this place...RUN!!!!!

The waitress never said the price was raised when we inquired about the price $10.50 as we were ordering.  Also, the practice of advertising combos on their menu and on their windows is only for to go orders.

The food again is delicious and spectacular.  During a busy time the waitress still tended to us while juggling to make the drinks. This time I ordered the BEC brioche, the egg is so soft, smooth and silky. It is not dry and overcooked like all other places that rushed to make eggs. When the plate came to the table, the sandwich is still steaming hot which is what I like about this place. Cooked to order and they put their time to making it good and delicious. The caramelized onions topped the sandwich off with the additional kick of flavor! Also ordered the banana brulee. The pancakes never fail - its still fluffy and soft. One thing I suggest for the establishment is to have better ventilation. The smoke from cooking fumes up to the seating area. The constant smell of oil is not always pleasing.

It had tables on the right and two gentlemen let me pick were i would sit as I was the first guest of the day (8:30am). In the mood for something sweet it was hard to choose which flavor of pancake would compliment my large cup of coffee and Morning potatoes. The tiramisu won and so did I. The mascarpone cheese was a perfect compliment to the light fluffy pancakes. The food wasn't bad 3.5/5, the service was pleasant 5/5and the damage was like $20 tip included. And guess what?? Less than 15 minutes of me being there it became busy couples and families and solos came in and I thought that was awesome. Cute little spot in the neighborhood.

Usually stop by if I'm too lazy to make my way to Clinton Baking co for some blue berry pancakes.The blue belly stack is comparable with the blue berry compote and maple butter syrup. Although the syrup isn't as thick in buttery consistency as Clinton Baking co.They have limited offerings for savory items.
213,Qu3xQh6cQ8BDwHIBaEtHuQ,2/25/2023,4 star rating,Cash only.Cute family run spot. Unique pancake recipes. (Brûlée all the wayyy)They always take awhile to make the pancakes so keep that in mind if you're arriving hungry. Sometimes the pancakes are a bit on the burned side.
214,Qu3xQh6cQ8BDwHIBaEtHuQ,2/9/2023,4 star rating,"I can't rave enough about Belly Cake. It has been my go-to brunch place for a quick bite and I actually appreciate its small and quaint space since I usually come here by myself whenever I do a workout nearby.I wouldn't say that the service is warm and friendly but it is exactly what I expect for a no-frills place where everyone is usually quicky going in and out. Not the type of place for a group setting (and please don't be those kinds of people since seating is limited). Prices are fair, but some menu items do tend to cost a little more if you opt for something a step above a regular item. So far, I've had the banana brulee pancakes and the pumpkin spice pancakes. Both really good--not overwhelmingly puffy stacks like many places emphasize, but definitely filling enough. Haven't had the chance to try the matcha brulee pancakes yet but that will be on my next visit.This place gets crowded very quickly, so make sure you don't come with a large group of people or during peak hours, otherwise, you risk waiting ~30 minutes or get unpleasantly placed in the back--right next to the bathroom. Cash-only place."
215,Qu3xQh6cQ8BDwHIBaEtHuQ,12/12/2022,4 star rating,"Belly Cake is a cute mom and pop cafe on Bell blvd. It's fairly small inside but still has a good amount of seats. I came on a Saturday morning and there were lots of families enjoying breakfast here as well. It's definitely a wholesome place with a simple menu of breakfast foods, most noticeably the pancakes but there are also several savory items as well. I got the choco coco belly stacks, which were chocolate pancakes. It was a stack of 3 fluffy pancakes that had a good chocolate flavor, but not too rich or overwhelming. The menu says it's filled with chocolate chips but there were only a few chocolate chips on top. It was also supposed to be ""dipped in chocolate ganache sauce"" but there was just a thicker layer of chocolate sauce on the top layer and the other 2 were plain chocolate pancakes. It did come with chocolate syrup on the side but that was also pretty light.I think these chocolate pancakes would be good for someone who likes chocolate but doesn't want something very heavy in the morning. I personally love chocolate foods, so for me, it could have a stronger chocolate flavor.There's also a lot of other unique pancake flavors like tiramisu, matcha brulee, banana brulee and more for all your different taste buds. I also noticed that their menu has a good amount of drinks - coffee, juices, smoothies, and teas. So definitely a great breakfast/brunch spot. Prices are also affordable as well!"

This was the star of the meal. My Farmer's plate came with eggs, potatoes, sausage (originally smoked ham), toast and a side salad. The salad was overly drenched but everything else was cooked and seasoned perfectly. As for the avocado toast, it fell a little short of our expectation. When it arrived, our first thought was, where's the rest of it? The smoked salmon was also minimal. I would pass on this dish. Cute place and it fills up quick. I shall come back again."

I've been in the bell blvd area multiple times for other places and have walked by it multiple times, but this was the first time I actually had a chance to try it. We came in on a saturday morning. The staff was very pleasant and seated us pretty quickly. There were multiple small families all enjoying breakfast as well. The menu had a good amount of options for both sweet and savory depending on your preference. I always love savory so I went with the Big Belly Wrap. My fiancee and her friend got pancakes and they both seemed to enjoy them. I was a big fan of the big belly wrap. The sauce on top was particularly very good and I made sure to finish it all off. Fyi it was cash only for payment. Not an issue, but just giving a heads up for anyone coming! Overall the price, quality and ambiance were all very good. I definitely enjoyed my breakfast and would definitely look forward to returning to try more things on their menu!"

We chose to sit at the back since they kept the door ajar on a cold day. We were offered menus immediately but our order was not taken till a tad later. We noticed there's only one service person and one in the kitchen. The cups of coffee were served right away. My disappointment was that my coffee arrived cold. I requested for oatmilk, perhaps that's what did it? The extended wait time for the food caused the others to have their coffee turn cold as well. The Matcha Brûlée was delicious! It had the solid taste and texture that was a delight. The farmer's plate was gone in 60 seconds. I had a taste of the home fries and thought it was good. I didn't get the chance to try the original stack.Do come and give this place a try, but be prepared for the wait time. It's also cash only."

I give the business a call and they tell me that the food was already delivered....I said, ""No. I've been waiting for the food this whole time and nothing."" All I kept getting in return was ""it was already delivered."" I hung up and proceeded to get a refund and a sandwich elsewhere. Somehow this place grew progressively worse.

The staff was pretty quick to clean the table and sanitize it. My husband ordered a latte and some breakfast plate & I went with the Chakra Waffles and latte with oat milk. OH MAH GAWD... my plate was HUGE. It was just loaded with a lot of stuff lol. Nutella explosion I say. Plenty of whipped cream, of course. I really appreciated the generosity but man, I was worried I fear for the risk of getting a heart attack. I was actually overwhelmed and had to share some with my husband because it was just too much!The coffee was okay, nothing to rave about. On top of that, they didn't ask to see our vaccination cards. So I was kinda eating in fear... and tried to finish up as fast as I could. Really wish we had a chance to check out this place before the pandemic so we may have had a much better experience.For now, I'm happy to give 4 stars."

I would've loved to do some work here but my busy schedule unfortunately did not allow it.The spot is right off of Queens Boulevard, so you might have a tough time parking, but it's well worth it. This café isn't large, but there's some seating here. The inside decor is really comforting and warm and there is also some seating outside as well. I was absolutely starving so I asked the person behind the counter if they had any suggestions. After quickly going over the sandwich selection I decided to go with their salami sandwich. This sandwich usually has avocado but they were all out. I really appreciated them letting me know right off the bat and asking if I wanted to substitute any ingredients instead of the avocado. I went with some arugula as it's one of my favorite sandwich ingredients. The sandwich was awesome! The salami was great quality and the sandwich was warmed up which allowed the cheese to melt slightly. No pictures available because as I said I was starving and completely devoured the whole sandwich. It also came with a side salad which was very nice and a great surprise. Can't wait to try other menu items such as their smoothies, their baklava, and maybe even some breakfast. Great service as well! Huge fan and can't wait to go back!"
240,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,12/31/2012,4 star rating,"Subway rarely fails when it comes to picking locations for their next store. This is the perfect spot for this shop on the site formerly held by the Little Language Playhouse, it's a busy area with lots of activity during the day and night and this store will do well here. The space is small and only has room for a few high chair tables so keep that in mind if you are looking to stay. You know the deal with all Subway restaurants so it's most likely that you know what you want when arriving and this place will have everything you are looking for. This would be a 3 and a half star review but the 4th comes for the fact that they deliver! It's free too! Genius move by management, especially in this neighborhood because they will make a killing.One dose of reality i was shown here on my first visit was the ice block of frozen flat bread that was lifted from the freezer. I always knew it wasn't ""fresh"" but they probably should have some room temperature flat breads ready instead of pounding the ice solid block on the table in front of you, heating up one for me and then asking what i wanted on top. So, yes, the flat bread is frozen solid, but it's healthier than McDonald's (unless you are a triple meat and pound of ranch sauce kind of person).OK, I'm off on another tangent, this place is fine, enjoy your sandwich if you like your server wearing a Yankees hat...i'm a Mets fan.Happy New Year"

I've gone a few times out of desperation. I've had an employee on the phone the whole time while taking my order- I wouldn't mind if he could multitask but seriously he put all the wrong toppings on my sandwich. I've been in to find one lady employee passed out at one of the tables... with her phone in her hand. But the worst was the same sleepy passed out lady actually working. She just stood and stared at me while I was trying to order- when I tried to order she had an attitude and hardly put anything on my sandwich. They always have a broken ice machine with a pool of melted ice on the floor.. with NO caution sign. Absolute worst place in NYC. I can't believe yelp wont let me do negative stars.

I felt the need to write in to ""report"" how they are failing on the Subway website. Below is what I wrote to corporate:I almost always get a Veggie Delite salad, or sometimes turn a Spicy Italian into a Salad. Every once in a while when a new sandwich comes out, I will give it a try.Today I decided to get an Eggplant Parmesan  Footlong and a Spicy Italian Salad. The woman that helped me did not use a knife to cut the bread but instead tore it open using her bare hands (no gloves). I decided not to get the sandwich after seeing that and proceeded to order the salad. The lettuce was not fresh, and I guess it was rinsed in water in the morning when they put in in the case as it was soggy and dripping. The spinach was withered and most of the veggies were mixed up with other veggies. This is a problem for me as I am allergic to red onions. I let her finish the salad, but once I took it home I had to throw it away as there were 2 pieces of onions, and after seeing the withered spinach and soggy lettuce I was concerned that I might get sick from the lack of freshness.Please please please, talk to this franchise owner. This locations needs to be trained on how to keep the veggies fresh and their workstation clean. Overall food safety training might improve this location alot. However I will not be back to this location. Which is unfortunate as I am in the area alot."

I'm happy you can tip on Apple Pay now but it would be ideal if it didn't decide for you that you HAVE to tip the largest amount on a small order.

It wasn't really busy as there was no morning rush and just the lunch crew. The people working there were super polite and very knowledgeable. They answered all of our questions. I had to update my app, so they just prepared my order while it updated and charged me afterward. Really nice of them to trust us like that. I had no idea there was free wifi at all the Starbucks, too. That was neat. I asked for a drink without caffeine and got the pink drink. I must say, I liked it a lot. My coworker got the last pistachio cold brew of the store, too (which I heard is seasonal). We both thought our drinks were refreshing and well made."

Sometimes the wait for your drink can be long so definitely add some extra time in but it's a really busy Starbucks so it makes sense.My go to is a blonde roast, chai tea latte or one of their holiday drinks. Can't really go wrong with those. Price is expensive but so are all the coffee shops in nyc if you don't go to a deli :)"

It wasn't really busy as there was no morning rush and just the lunch crew. The people working there were super polite and very knowledgeable. They answered all of our questions. I had to update my app, so they just prepared my order while it updated and charged me afterward. Really nice of them to trust us like that. I had no idea there was free wifi at all the Starbucks, too. That was neat. I asked for a drink without caffeine and got the pink drink. I must say, I liked it a lot. My coworker got the last pistachio cold brew of the store, too (which I heard is seasonal). We both thought our drinks were refreshing and well made."

325,MPV-rSjFjfxJDjOV97NwUw,10/12/2019,1 star rating,"This Starbucks store is located at 90 Park Avenue, with so many Starbucks stores around New York (I'm sure they have the second-highest amount of stores in one city here, after Shanghai) there are so many different stores which you can choose from, after all there's one a few stores down either block / avenue from here - based on my experience I would say you'd be better off at one of them.The store is a decent size, but there isn't much seating - there is only ONE table... I repeat ONE table of regular size, the rest seem to be really high, uncomfortable bar-style seating which are not appropriate for wheelchair users etc, with seats so close together you're basically squashed and forced to listen to everyone else's conversations with little space to even move.The tables didn't seem especially clean and despite being in the store for a while I didn't see any staff members attempting to clean the few tablespaces they did have, relying on customers to do their job for them.Only one staff member seemed friendly in the store - the rest seemed a little incompetent from taking my drink order wrong- I was given a cocoa cloud macchiato rather than caramel(Paying  $6.48 for a drink which is already expensive (Drinks can cost around $1.64 more than the UK in comparison) and being given the wrong drink isn't good enough especially when THEY MADE THE WRONG DRINK WRONG - the barista used too much foam to the point it was flowing down the cup and the drink was too foamy overall (and chocolaty) I normally love the foam made with egg-whites, but they seemed to fuck up a drink which I previously loved.The selection of merch is a little small compared to other stores.The seating doesn't work, issues with my drink and staff seeming incompetent (other than the staff member who sold me a premade iced tea in the evening who seemed pleasant and began talking to me about my stay in NY), the toilets also being really dirty was a big let-down. There are around 250 Starbucks locations in Manhatten alone, so if you want a Starbucks it is pretty easy to avoid this branch, and I think you should.1*"

I mean it might take a while to get your drink, like all Starbucks, because it's such a popular place, but the staff are super nice and I think they should get recognized for that.

327,MPV-rSjFjfxJDjOV97NwUw,6/5/2016,3 star rating,"I came here to get some work done remotely on a Friday morning while my sister worked at a hotel nearby.I'm not a fan of the one homeless man who continuously walks in and out with his big tattered suitcase. He sits in a corner and counts his money, buys a single coffee, walks outside and tosses it in the street... And repeat. He kept eying people and speaking incomprehensibly to himself, except for his occasional rude blasphemes. Other than that, the people watching here is quite interesting. I was here almost 4 hours and the different backgrounds and reasons people were here was insane. From the two African men working on Salesforce consulting to the crying woman in the corner... The distractions for me were infinite. I did however enjoy the self service condiment bar, where you can find every milk and cream you can think of. Half and half, skim and whole milk, soy milk, coconut milk... I guess they're just missing almond milk. Usually these milk options cost extra, so it was great that these were provided. Ok, but really, it isn't ok for this Starbucks to not have a bathroom. You can't feed me these natural laxatives and diuretics (coffee and tea) and not expect me to need to use the toilet. Otherwise, this is your standard office building Starbucks, with limited seating (thanks to the homeless man talking up the only real table/cushioned seating in the store) and people coming in and out for coffee."

When I place a mobile order, the option to order a Frappuccino is still there but when I arrive to pick it up, I'm told the blender is broken. I'm offered a refund but no other courtesy for the inconvenience and hardly even an apology. That isn't the only issue. Other times I place a mobile order for one of their iced teas and same thing. I get there and am told ""we ran out of tea. Would you like a refund?"".  I'm done frequenting this location. It used to be reliable but for the past few months it's been a disappointment more often than not. If you run out of something or cannot fulfill an order, there should be a way to indicate as such on the app so people like me who are rushing to catch a train aren't wasting their time waiting for refunds for orders that cannot be completed."

These days, I give any customer service employees major props for dealing with all the displaced aggression floating around the city and Adrian really handles the stress and crowds so well. This has become my new go-to Starbucks for that reason. Highly recommend this location conveniently located across the street from Fairway and around the corner from Trader Joe's."

However, if you do find something palatable you're not guaranteed that it will taste good the next time you come.

347,M3esPgE0_F_VUzCnQc5Qig,4/1/2020,4 star rating,"The food alone gets five stars. Minus one star for delayed delivery but I'm definitely willing to give this place another chance. We ordered the Hennessey wings, oxtail and chop Suey. First, the wings are absolutely massive and you get four of them in an order, along side rice and peas and some provisions. They are cooked so perfectly that they pretty much fall off the bone and the sauce is incredible. I don't even like Hennessey liquor but this sauce is quite tasty. I recommend getting some sauce on the side to mix with some of the rice.The oxtail, small order, is enough for two people to share, with a healthy portion of meat alongside your side of choosing, the beef melts in your mouth and is full of rich flavor. Chop Suey is full of flavor and quite tasty, I recommend ordering some Coco bread to go along with everything. Last but not least, the plantain porridge is like a dreamy and creamy oatmeal that is perfect for the cold weather mornings"

Called again at 8pm to cancel the order because 1. The weather was getting worse and I felt bad for the delivery person and 2. I was visiting my mother to make sure she was good for the storm so I had to start heading back to Long Island. The woman on the phone proceeded to go off on me about the weather and how there was nothing she could do to make the delivery person drive faster. All I did was ask to cancel the order. A man got on the phone and huffed that the driver was on the way. I waited until 9pm and still no delivery. I made it back to Long Island and my mother said the food still hadn't been delivered. So I called the restaurant AGAIN and they finally agreed to cancel. Then I get an email with a receipt that the food was delivered! I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED A MEAL. Never again will I patronize this establishment whether it be in person or delivery. Now I have to dispute the order with Uber eats.

A hour past so i decided to call the restaurant to check the status. The young lady who answered told me the driver is a little behind due to the fact that he had few more orders. Another 30-45 mins past my co worker called again the worker said the driver called saying he was stuck in traffic which was a lie. I never received or got a miss call. The food finally arrived at 8:10 pm which was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT !The order was a mess and incorrect. The total with fees and grubhub deliver was about 37.00 for two orders. The first order was suppose to be a small steam salmon with  rice and peas and oxtail gravy ( 15.99 ). And a side of sweet plantains ( 4.00 ). The second order was a small chop suey with white rice (11.00). What we received was two small steak cheap portion burnt salmon for 15.99 with rice and peas. A mini plate with white rice and oxtail gravy. The chop suey came with rice and peas and barely any chicken. The food presentation and flavors wasn't the best and def not worth the price or wait. The only good thing was the sweet plantains.

353,BPLhZ4FildfaCiKLNd0dsA,11/26/2022,4 star rating,"I enjoy visiting Jupiter Disco. Its location is great, in Bushwick right on the border of buzzing Ridgewood. It's also near the train and other venues, such as House of Yes. I think Jupiter Disco is a great pregame spot or first stop on your night out -- it's usually free entry before 11 and the drinks are solid. Their house cocktails are $15 which is a tad pricey, but they're definitely strong and well-crafted. The bartenders, even on busy nights, put in the time and effort to make each drink perfectly.The vibe is great. You might miss the place if you go by too quickly, since it doesn't have a sign and is inconspicuously settled in the industrial side of town. Inside is super cool, a dark-lit room with a DJ and disco ball, purple and red lights and a cool neon space-looking thing behind the bar. The drink menu appears on TV screens in a matrix-style font. The crowd who goes there is that pretentious hipster type, but they're not annoying and don't bother anybody. It's actual of-age people in here. The bathrooms aren't immaculate, but the two that are in there are OK for the size of the place and the amount of people in there. You don't usually wait on line long.My only complaint is the music. While I absolutely adore that the DJs spin actual records, they play mostly obscure techno music with no lyrics. It's not bad at all, but I find myself standing there with my friend like ""what am I dancing to?"" If they could switch it up between that type of music (because it does fit the vibe) with some old-school disco hits that folks can sing along to, Jupiter Disco would be my dream bar."

It was bumping but empty enough to find two seats at the bar. The space is pretty cool. The best part is the entry way -- it looks like a 70s spaceship mock up from a telly show. The menu of the bar -- like everyone stated is on a tv. It's frustrating because they go by pretty fast and the bartenders aren't too helpful. They tell you to check the website for the menu. There should be at least ONE paper menu. The DJ is cool and did try his best to fulfill request. But his library is limited.Drinks are actually pretty good but they're fru-fru drinks. Depending on what you get you might have more ice than alcohol. I would come back. I did eventually -- with guy I texting in the bathroom all night on the original date.It was a much better experience -- but only for the company.

The one I tried (my boyfriend's), was offensive to the taste buds and every time I thought I had rid my palate of it, it was back for another battle. I ended up settling on a Bells Two Hearted (the devil you know, after all). The beer was $8 no less...Music is John Hughes if John Hughes had no taste.

The decor is not as...dystopian/Blade Runner/sci-fi....or whatever, as articles and reviews have made it out to be. It's dark, there is some old technology sprinkled about, but I wouldn't call it themed. What made our freakin night was the bartender, Mellie. She was the BEST. We talked Buffy and movies and music and science and politics and everything. We came in a little after opening, she was still shaping the ice for the cocktails and chatted with us the entire time. I know the drink she made me was amazing but can't remember a thing about it. I also know the music was great, but same story. It was a Sunday. Go and see her and say hi."

The ambiance is dark and definitely disco-y (is that a word), it's a cool, sensual almost vibe in a dive bar setting. The drinks were a little cheaper than Manhattan, but not by much. They were okay, nothing really fantastic that stood out to me.The drinks menu was projected on the tv in Galaga type font, going off the Jupiter vibe I assume. They flash by a little quick, but are fun to read on the screen. The bartenders were friendly. One of them accidentally spilled half of my drink on the table as he was preparing it and then still charged me for it, which I was really disappointed about but didn't want to make a fuss as there were more people waiting.I asked the DJ to play Whitney Houston, which is what I would consider disco, but he didn't have any unfortunately. I'd suggest increasing the number of songs in the library as well because they all blended together and sounded the same unfortunately. People were dancing in a huddle towards the front of the music, but it's a pretty tight place.The entrancewas hard to find as well, which I guess goes along with the intergalactic vibe, but was just really inconvenient as it was raining."

If you order online, you can only order by the whole pie. The best slice has to go to the Angry Nona. The combination of hot honey, plum sauce, and spicy soppressata was just beautiful. I never thought a hint of sweetness could be such a game-changer! The vodka slice was more subtle, but still very flavorful! The sauce was thick and the crust had just the right amount of crunch. It was even more creamy with the addition of ricotta. Overall a truly life changing moment that you must experience for yourself!"

Had it a few times taste great every time except it takes too long to get your pizza, that's the only reason why I wouldn't give this place a 5 star rating. I'll probably just order a whole pizza next time so I don't have to wait. Food 5/5Service 2/5 Ambiance 3/5"

BUT very worth it. Delicious slices and fun different types of pizza. I truly don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu, even if they run out of one you wanted to try. They have some seating outside but nothing guaranteed. I believe you can actually order ahead or for delivery now which I would recommend if you're having people over and want a whole pie. but it's a great spot to grab some slices and try all their different kids!"
367,m3PS0tIaa0ChcP8Y5S-DrQ,2/10/2023,5 star rating,So I was told to come here to try it out for a friend after watching an influencer post about them... I'll be honest and I had expectations for their pizza.I wanted to get the Angry Nonna's but it wasn't available at the time I got there. So I ended up getting the pepperoni... so was I a little sad? Yes.BUT when I got the pepperoni and bit into it... man did my mood change. Mama's Too's pizza was delicious. Crispy bottom with a chewy mid and topped with pepperoni cups... I'll eat 10 more of these.Check out the video I made with ASMR @phidingthefan

Judging from how the pizza settled I'm going to agree with him, but at cost per slice I wasn't about to have a smorgasbord sampler on my own. I'm still tempted to come back for their chicken cutlet sandwich but I saw a lot of left over pizza on their outdoor dining tables which I wouldn't expect on a chilly January day."
369,m3PS0tIaa0ChcP8Y5S-DrQ,1/27/2023,5 star rating,"This is now my best square slice in all of New York City. I got the Poached Pear, and the Angry Nonna. On both the crust was perfectly crispy and chewy with delicious caramelized cheese on the edges. The poached pear was interesting. The pears weren't overly sweet and paired well with a strong cheese like Gorgonzola. I really enjoyed this.The Angry Nonna, though, was my favorite. The salami was deliciously, meaty and spicy. The hot honey I did a lovely level of sweetness and heat."
370,m3PS0tIaa0ChcP8Y5S-DrQ,1/7/2023,5 star rating,"Wow. I cannot believe it took me so long to write this review. I've been getting my pies from Mama's Too ever since I moved to NYC - and it felt like the most underrated slice in the city. Mama's Too is your local pizza spot with some of the funnest pie flavors ever. My personal favorite is the Angry Nonna slice. I mean.. could you ever go wrong with a thick square slice, with sopprasetta and spicy honey? The flavor combo is just the best. You bite into a crispy, doughy slice, and get a taste of the perfect red sauce, some spicy notes with the sopprasetta, and a touch of sweetness with the honey. Also the crunchy crust doesn't hurt. Head to the UWS now and get this slice. Now we all know that the only way to truly know what's the deal with a pizza shop is their house slice. And Mama's Too knows what's up. The dough is thick, crispy and perfectly doughy and the sauce to cheese ratio is perfect. They always add fresh basil which is just perfect. If you haven't tried this place yet, head there now. You can walk in whenever and you'll understand why I'm raving about this place."

372,1_JEFOI19hAu3VoODcTUvw,10/26/2022,4 star rating,"A rare find in Chinatown - a premium sushi spot that offers the Omakase experience or table service. Not your run of the mill sushi spot. This place has a nightclub feel walking in with the bar counter right at the entrance and the neon lights. Lends to the vibe which leads to a cooler, dimmer lit dining room area. The  menu offers great snack and appetizer choices if you're a light eater or just  want a variety especially while knocking back a few drinks. The rice bowls, sushi plates, whether pre-set, a la carte or custom - so many great choices. The drink menu definitely doesn't disappoint! The food I did get: - Appetizer Takoyaki, so good when it's hot and fresh from the kitchen. Had a good bounce to them.- I thorougly enjoyed my uni and scallop bowl with the chefs choice sashimi. Uni and sashimi selections were excellent but the baby scallops were meh. They lacked the sweetness of a traditional scallop. I could've done without or prefer a roe instead. - Scallop sashimi we ordered a la carte, lovely and sweet.- wagyu sushi was good but not as flavorful as I hoped. - Salmon skin salad was good - just needed to mix the soy sauce based dressing more with the greens. When I got to the bottom, it was very noticeable. So mix it, okay?Drinks are half the reason you're here so give the lychee martini a try."

The color of the uni was not particularly appealing but taste was still good (not the best). Hard to go wrong with uni and ikura but definitely felt like it was too expensive for the amount I got.My friend got the Mulberry Bowl ($44) and felt similarly about the value. Overall, the ambience was fine (and the karaoke-ers in the back room were amusing) and the food was fine, but the search continues for a more satisfying donburi bowl. Tip: Bring cash! There's a 4% surcharge if you pay by card."

We ordered the 16 piece for two which comes with a variety of sushi based on the special for the day and spicy tuna hand roll. I'd highly recommend as everything tasted really good. The drinks were a bit overpriced and not as strong as indicated. I ordered the ghost drink which tasted like another rendition of the Moscow mule but with less sugar. Probably better to opt for just a sake."

The service is prompt, and there isn't much to complain on that end. The food on the other hand was disappointing. We have had better spicy salmon rolls. It seemed to be put together somewhat clumsily, and didn't taste all that great either. The beef Udon, which I shouldn't have ordered on such a hot day, was underwhelming. It is, however, a sizeable dish and should take care of your hunger. The chicken Katsu was probably the best of the lot. It is always a safe choice, an appetizing dish. Be aware that the final charge already includes a 20% tip but also includes a 4% credit card charge, unless you decide to pay in cash."

381,1_JEFOI19hAu3VoODcTUvw,9/27/2022,2 star rating,Underwhelmed by the food and quality of the fish. I shared a couple of things and the best thing was the kani salad which doesn't say much. The fish had a fishy taste and I didn't like how the pieces were cut and the variety provided. The spicy tuna hand roll was not edible. The gyoza were just okay not fully cooked. The crispy rice with salmon wasn't actually crispy and I didn't love that the jalapeño on top was pickled. Wouldn't order again.

It was a bit sweeter than I would've liked.There are plenty of tables. There's free wifi, and there is a restroom that is clean. Not a lot of outlets though, so if you plan to work on your laptop, make sure it's fully charged before you go. Staff are nice. They brought the drink to me. Prices are fair."

The workers are sweet as well and there's a Gowanus Community Fridge there too which I thought was pretty great!"
427,6IdG1EY4qZ_X9GtqIAmQEg,2/15/2023,2 star rating,It's a funky basement type coffee shop that doesn't prioritize excellent beans or barista skills.  The cappuccinos are mostly milk.  The staff is nice but the service is slovenly.  Oddly all the bright colors don't help the somewhat depressing vibe of the place.  Lots of folks call it homey but it just kind of seems dirty to me.  The outdoor seating is a highlight.  The computer crowd seems to love it.

They also do not have a self service machine nor the screen to order on your own. The service every time I come here it's pretty fast and the lines move fast. Probably cause they always have 2-3 people on the register.  The staff are never rude and they are not cheap with sauces. Food was warm and fresh so I have no complaints besides it not being as big as the other McDonald's And not being able to get refills like the ones downtown and Lexington Ave . Also the place is pretty clean tables bathroom etcc.. there's also a drive tru but I don't see a lot of people using it .

The other workers were watching me for a reaction, they were clearly not focused due to the fact that they were invested in me & were way behind schedule. I decided to just order a breakfast meal & even so they gave me food that wasn't freshly made, my mcgriddle was cold & the sausage was already falling out of it when I had first opened the wrapping.

I've read every review on Yelp in regards to low star rating and I can tell you right now that most of the people are just salty over the auntie on the phone.

It's my top 5 burger in NYC, I'd say the #2 spot after 5 Napkin (which is just 8 blocks down 9th Ave).But this spot is also great for cocktails and happy hour too. It's a nice neighborhood restaurant/bar and there's really nice outdoor seating. Staff are always friendly and they always cook the Alfie's grassfed burger just right. They also put Gruyere cheese, shallots and portobello mushrooms on these burgers, which give them a unique taste with a little bit of crunch.Even though 5 Napkin is my favorite burger spot in the area, I would honestly go to Alfie's over 5 Napkin only because Alfie's has more of a neighborhood/dive bar feel, whereas 5 Napkin is good but has a more chain restaurant vibe."

First, I know it's incredibly hard in the service industry now, and I'm not trying to say that folks here aren't kind and under stress. However, I've now had two instances where the staff messed up orders, or just didn't provide the relevant service. It's super important here to check your receipt before you leave and dispute in person if any item didn't come out. I tried to correct an order issue (and even under priced it) in a credit card dispute for a Beet and Goat Cheese dish that was never served. The note from the store owner accused me of trying to take the $16 tip back for the $17 dish that wasn't delivered, and said I was trying to get something for free... On a big group bill it was easy to miss until I did the itemization at home.Great spot, but they're a bit relaxed and hostile if you try to get a fair outcome due to missing dishes, or drinks that don't come.

Definitely very limited vegan options, which was unfortunate for our vegan friend. My favorites were the truffle mac and general tso's crispy cauliflower. The truffle flavor of the mac is strong and super cheesy, and the cauliflower breading is flavorful and perfect. The spinach artichoke dip is definitely artichokey, which I love.

I had the sweet potato fries with, and I was very happy with the choice. It was one of the better burgers to be had for sure, and I probably could have gone medium rare on it, which is something I would never think about asking for normally.Someone else at the table had the CHAR-GRILLED STEAK FRITES - 12 oz. NY Strip Steak, Hand-cut Fries, Green Beans, Chimichurri which looked amazing, and they were very happy with that as well.Then there is the fact that this place seems to have a full name of ""Alfie's Kitchen & Craft Beer Bar"" at least according to Resy. In addition to beer they have a very extensive drink menu, but my focus will also be on the beer. For me there were several new ones to be had here and what is nice is everything is on a board that is easily visible."

Plenty of times when we do a Costco run, which is only two blocks away. We have always had the curiosity to go there, but tend to forget that it's there because it's in the middle of the block kind of hidden next to the post office. But I do have to say that I was highly highly unexpected and what happened and how the food was there when we went for breakfast. Me and my friend got breakfast. I had the three a platter with turkey bacon and corn beef hash my friend had the breakfast with pancakes and a side of corn beef hash. The platters are actually a really good price and value in terms of size for what you're paying and getting the only thing that was a little surprising to us. It was the size of the corn beef hash, which is almost 6 dollars for a side of it and when you get it, it is really small. But the fact of the matter is that it is home made corn beef hash so it was the best corn beef hash I have had in a really really long time you can taste the real corn beef and not process canned corn beef hash. I have gone to many diners in the area of Queens, and this by far took the number one spot of corn beef hash especially when it's really hot it taste so good That has alone made it even more amazing. The staff is wonderful very attentive and it's clean so I highly recommend this place. If you go for breakfast try the corn beef hash I haven't tried everything else, but just on breakfast alone it made my day it was satisfying and they are very quick service. They're very friendly, so please please give it a chance. I am looking forward to going there again and even trying something new I see they do have a lot of pieces I'm curious about that so if you're in the area, queen, center mall or the Rego Park Center look for this diner, you won't be disappointed."

I ordered the Milano Panini and it tasted really good, maybe cause I was hungry or whatever the case, I devoured the sandwich quick and fast. My co-worker shared his garlic knots with me, which was good. The diner's menu has a wide selection of Pizzas to Burgers, sandwiches, and popular milkshakes. There's also indoor/outdoor seating, so finding a seat is an easy task. Even though the staff was friendly, they do get a bit pushy when more customers are coming in. Overall, great diner spot"

The food tends to be on the slightly greasy side, but nothing crazy for diner food. Overall, it's pretty good food. The portions are massive, and the prices are fair for a good value. I'm also always impressed by how much variety they offer, and many of the meals give flexible options for the sides. The service is always really good here. They are very friendly, and they treat you like part of the family. Even when it gets busy, I have never felt rushed. I would recommend making a stop by for brunch if you find yourself in the area."

Started off with bowl of cream of turkey soup and that was delicious with nice chunks of turkey visible. Side salad was typical nothing special although vegetables were nice and fresh. Main course was Penne pasta with garlic oil and I decided to add shrimp. For $20 you would expect 5 jumbo shrimp but got a whole bunch of extremely salty baby shrimp. Cmon man!

There hookah is on point. Strong, so many flavors, and you can smoke for hours and the flavor is still there. Not only is the hookah amazing but the service is outstanding. The owner is a sweetheart and makes sure the customer is 100% satisfied not only with the hookah but the environment. He gives his general opinion and doesn't want to take advantage of people. He literally told us not to waste money and to get the ice hose because the regular hose has ice in it.  The people that smoke there are so sweet and yes, you will get carded so have a form of ID with your date of birth. The Moroccan tea is very good, and to smoke pomegranate mixed with anything is not going to disappoint. If you don't want to spend the five dollars on the ice hose there regular hookahs have a little ice cooler inside that makes the smoke come out cold. If you want it cold the whole time your there get the large ice and pay the five dollars. The guys are always coming around changing the coal. You can stay there as long as you want and you are not feeling rushed to leave. I always get hookah special on the fruit but this time I got regular and I LOVED it!This place is a must come to smoke hookah. The owner is an amazing cook too, cant wait to come back and try his Yemen style food! Highly recommend coming here. We ordered to regular hookahs, 1 Morocco tea, two waters, and a gingerale. It came out to 31 dollars. So with tip $40 well spent."

My friends got some sandwiches cause they were hungry and they said it tasted good and it also came with a mini bag of lays chips. I got some Yemeni tea and a bottle of water.I also wanted to try the hookah here and it was really good. They have SO many different flavors to choose from and they go from regular to exotic flavors. They also have starbuzz flavors which are really good. There are some mixtures that they make and they have different names or you can ask them to mix flavors you want. I got Code 69 from starbuzz with a grapefruit head and an ice hose! It costed $21 dollars for my hookah which isn't bad at all because I have gone to other lounges and tried getting the same thing and it ended up costing almost $35 which is crazy. I smoked my hookah for three hours and it never burnt. They use good charcoal here and they also change it often so it doesn't burn. The customer service here was really good overall. The girl that took care of us was extremely sweet and helpful explaining things since it was also our first time going there. They also change the coal often and you never have to ask for it. I would defiantly return here again.

I talked a friend of mine to trek here from the city to watch a world cup match. ""Watch Egypt play with Egyptians!"" I said. This spot is conveniently located next to the Bay Ridge Ave stop so I recommended it. He got there before me. He was the only non Arab there. I soon joined him and we ordered a hookah and couple of drinks from nice waitress. We wanted to eat but they weren't serving food. Around halftime the manager/owner comes by and says it's $15 entrance fee because the game was on. Nowhere was this posted, and no one told us this before we sat. A regular sitting next to us saw I was disappointed and assured me the man was joking... We watched the rest of the match and when I asked for the bill the same guy came by and insisted on the $30.. he wasn't joking! I gave him the money to avert making a scene, not worth it for me. No one else there was charged this. This was not a pay-per-view event. He was clearly scamming us. He assured me that next time it'll be different..There will be no next time.  This is a dishonest business and probably racist as well, and gives Arabs a bad name.  If you're in the area, walk a little farther from the station, avoid this place at all costs, and give your money to someone who deserves it."

The ambiance is homey and cozy, it's a cute little spot for family dinners or date night. The food was delicious! My husband got the meatballs and spaghetti , he said the meatballs were one of the best he had in a while. I ended up getting the gluten free cacio pepe, which was delicious! We also ended up getting the margarita pizza, which was light, and perfectly crispy.We couldn't help ourselves and ended up getting the apple tart, which was freshly made.

My kids loved it here. As for service, it was a very attentive staff that catered to your every need. We were definitely take care of here!"
499,oUVX94JtKyLPXozC2hemCg,2/11/2023,3 star rating,"Came here on a Friday night, you definitely need a reservation ahead of time. My party and I waited a little but I did realize there was a very large birthday going on, so that's probably why. We had the whole branzino, carbonara, and the salmon. They forgot the vegetables with the branzino and it came out later. It was honestly disappointing and bland. The carbonara wasn't the worst but wasn't the best. We asked for chili oil and it helped a lot! The salmon was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth. The cheese plate had a great assortment of cheeses but definitely needed more crostini. The food took an hour to come out, so to wait that long and have it be subpar, that was disappointing. Dessert is the STAR here, and I'm not even a sweets person. I would gladly eat their tiramisu any day of the week. Lattes were also creamy and well made. Not too overwhelming for the end of the meal. They only have one Prosecco on the list right now and it's very crisp and refreshing. Definitely a dry prosecco that went great with the fish. The service was great when the staff was around but considering the price and area, it was definitely lacking. I'm not sure if it was the large party (it was ~30% empty) or everyone was just exhausted from a long night. Water cups were not refilled, they didn't ask us how we were doing. They didn't bring the check on time either, even when it came to closing. We were just kind of sitting around and waiting towards the end of the night. Branzino 6.5/10 - perfect cook on it, blandCarbonara 7/10 - tasted boringSalmon 9/10Tiramisu 10/10 - best i've ever had For our party of three including 20% tip, ~260"

It was really nice, just nothing like what we were expecting ordering focaccia. My husband got a pasta special, which was really nice and was a sizable portion. The vegan ravioli was a miss for me, though -- while it tasted fresh and homemade, there just wasn't so much flavor in the filling or sauce, which was broth-like. For dessert, I tried the peach sorbet, which is served in a frozen peach. This was really nice, though not much sorbet for the price, given that the frozen peach was cool for presentation but not actually edible. There was a cozy fire going when we came in, which was a really nice touch! This is a really small thing, but it was a lot more brightly lit than I'd expect for the space overall. Not a big deal of course but didn't seem to fit the vibe. Overall totally good in its own right and happy we tried it, but we'd be much more likely to head to our default in the area next time, Il Falco."

We tried them out because we were looking for someone to cater for a dinner and we absolutely loved it. Diane was very helpful and friendly when we placed our order in person. Delivery was very punctual, arrived at the exact time we asked for. We got a full tray of both the chicken parm and the flank steak, half tray each of penne a la vodka and the orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe, as well as a half tray of the roasted veggies. The pastas are phenomenal, cooked perfectly al dente and the vodka sauce was very tasty just the way we like it not too light in color. Chicken parm was juicy and tender, and the steak was cooked perfectly. Everyone raved about the food (for reference it was 14 people), everyone wanted to know where it was from. The food was beyond sufficient, we had about half leftover. On an additional note, their amaretto tiramisu is a must try, truly delicious. Sweet, moist and full of flavor. Overall we were very pleased and definitely recommend, can't wait to dine there soon."

Easily walked in for dinner on a Friday, but it was kind of downhill from there.  Caesar salad was good. Calamari fritti was tasty, but could have been crispier. Broccoli rabe e sausage orecchiette was also decent. Linguine nere was strangely super spicy, like someone dumped way too many crushed chili flakes on it. But the biggest thing was that we experienced a huge wait between apps and entrees... I think the kitchen lost our ticket. If the food were amazing, I would have probably forgiven that, but alas. With other great options nearby (Il Falco; Manducatis), I prob won't come back here."

This comes with a side of mixed veggies and vegetable rice. The cut of salmon is always generous. Shrimp is a tasty added bonus if you're feeling more on the hungry side. Both the shrimp and salmon are well seasoned. The rice is not bad. I persoanlly enjoy the veggies and sometimes like to sub out the rice for even more veggies as a healthier alternative.Small staff of friendly faces!If you're looking to dine in there's more than enough room to do so.This place is worth the stop in.

We always passed by this place since it's right off Woodhaven and we were curious to see if it's good. I'm just going to cut right to it... it is good. I loved what I got which was the catfish with fries. My hubby got 9 wings with fried rice. My catfish was very crispy and juicy. The wings were good but my hubby didn't like the amount of onions in the fried rice. So next time, we'll definitely ask for no onions or less onions. A plus is that they are very clean. The restaurant is almost spotless. The man at the register was like sanitizing his hands before using the register too. Definitely something we look out for now since COVID and we have a newborn at home. Anyways. If you're in the area and looking for something quick, and you're tired of the usual, then go here!

But as a neighborhood joint, it's doing something.There was a small Asian lady working the front, she was super nice and the guys working the stoves were chill too. Good people.Food was what I wasn't feeling. Their fried stuff tasted like straight old oil. Even the hot sauce I flooded it with disappeared in its domination. Fried rice was light and grilled veggies were actually solid but I'd definitely avoid their fried stuff.Overall, this is a place for people on the block *maybe* the neighboring ones too.

I did have to wait about 10 minutes for the chicken as they had to make a fresh batch but the wait is definitely worth it. The fried rice I thought was a bit too sweet probably due to the chicken wing sauce but those wings are top notch, very juicy and meaty I was quite impressed. Restaurant itself was very clean and empty when I visited its actually large enough to have decent amount of people in here.

Then they start cooking! They seem to follow procedures to the letter when it comes to assembling the sandwiches and cooking up sides, and we've never had to wait long for our food, which has always been hot after we walk home and dig in.Of course, I love seeing youth work jobs like these (and they may very well be given shifts before sundown and I just don't know 'cause at my desk eating Wasa crackers pretending I've never heard of Checkers and can't stand ""death"", i.e., animal protein, in my body), but the crew we're used to giving business to demonstrates why they're trusted to run the show during the late shift.Well done!"

530,WdaLydR9O57rWbTnQQQ1OQ,12/20/2017,3 star rating,"Reminds me of a Dominican spot but Bengali food. They have the same set up with the prepared foods out in the open for customers to see and ready to scoop up. It was an ok experience for me and I'll dive into the details:Place - can't miss the corner spot that is colored red. Once inside you'll see that there is plenty of seats and tables for you to dine in. Plenty of parking around the area as well. I didn't think it was dirty but it does feel eh...probably because the interior is old. Service - the only lady I saw working was working hard. She took my order and told me what they had for the day but listen carefully because you'll be hearing thick accents. Very helpful! Food - ended up getting the lamb biryani rice with some chicken tikka masala. It was good! Not the best but did the job. I believe because I got the lamb ($9) and that I added a bit of the tikka, it ended up to be ($10). I think the chicken biryani is ($8) which is fairly priced. I also picked up a vegetable samosa for ($1). They also have plenty of options for vegetarians, as most places like this do. If you're in the area and want a fix, try it out but I wouldn't trek here if you're from afar."

Yeah, I suggest you starve then because this place will land you in the hospital!Maybe this establishment was under different management a year ago because when I spoke to the employee working there a few nights ago, he stated they had been there for 8 months...and that's 8 months too long! I ended up purchasing a chicken biryani and a single tandoori chicken leg. I get home in anticipation to eat some wholesome and good brown food (based on the reviews), but to my surprise I was greeted with something out of a horror movie!The tandoori chicken leg was on top in a plastic container. I open the lid and it has a colorless texture and something pasty that looks like mold . I immediately lost my appetite. I didn't bother to open the biriyani but threw all of it in the trash. Hey don't take my word on it, I took a picture. You be the judge. If you want authentic Bengali style meals with rich aroma and flavor, head to Boishakhi in Astoria. ONLY place I'm willing to eat brown people food from."

We just celebrated our marriage anniversary and We were blown away by how perfect everything tasted. We selected our own menu and Ruma aunty cooked everything with perfection specially the Baby Goat curry Bangladeshi way. It was phenomenal in one word.
533,WdaLydR9O57rWbTnQQQ1OQ,7/20/2017,5 star rating,"I ordered the chicken biryani ($6) which came with a small salad and some potato thing and a vegetable samosa ($1). Both were very good and flavorful. There were plenty of spices and the biryani was packed full. One thing to note about the chicken biryani is that it is made with chicken thighs and contains bones so be careful when eating. The prices are great, the portions are generous and the food is delicious."

Everything was delicious. If you like homemade Bengali food, this is the place. We don't like the biryanis from Jackson Heights, this biryani was so good, that my son finished it in minutes, and I couldn't take a pic :)We will definitely go back. The owner was there, and she's an amazing person. Thank you for opening a Bangladeshi restaurant in our neighborhood, we needed one."
535,WdaLydR9O57rWbTnQQQ1OQ,5/30/2019,1 star rating,"I stepped in here expecting to order off the menu which they had a stack of lying around at the counter, but was told by an older gentleman that I couldn't order off of it and to order from the buffet style dishes lying out in the front, as they were ""fresh"". The glass buffet cover had the streaks of a greasy rag left on it since it was last wiped down, but I ignored that and kept an open mind - maybe the food is good!I chose 5 dishes from the handful of available ones and watched the man brush his fingers along his nose and then proceed to take a plate and start piling rice on it. Considering that unhygienic behavior is a fairly common practice in restaurants (albeit not in front of the customers), I ignored that and kept an open mind - maybe the food is good!Then he started microwaving the dishes. Here is when my doubts started creeping in that the food is good. Considering the absence of pricing on the buffet dishes and the inability to order off the menu which actually showed pricing, I decided to pay before eating to avoid any ""let's screw the non-native out of some money"" surprises later on. The price quoted was satisfactory for me; I paid, sat down and was brought a plastic jug of water and some lemons and plastic forks. Then the food came.I got a gigantic plate of plain rice. Dry rice. Rice that was flying to Bangladesh but crash landed in the Gobi Desert, then somehow survived and made its way out. I also got some dry bean things, one small and average-tasting eggplant piece, one small piece of dry bland fish, and 3 small pieces of goat, mostly bone. Lots of dry rice, very little everything else. The goat was the only decent thing, but in no way better than goat at any of the Indian places near Woodside. Also the other places do fresh all you can eat buffet for about the same price I paid here, where the meat portions aren't designed for a 6-year-old with a weak appetite.The older man was nice enough to bring by some cold appetizers that had been lying around for a few days, but they didn't make up for the dry, week-old lukewarm food. There was a tv playing behind me where an old half naked man was doing yoga. He was making grunting sounds, which nostalgically reminded me of videos I normally watch at home. I appreciated the novelty of the overall experience, but definitely won't be coming back."
536,WdaLydR9O57rWbTnQQQ1OQ,5/7/2021,5 star rating,Amazing home style Bangladeshi food. Was absolutely delicious. For those that don't know as most Americans don't know geography Bangladesh is a small country next to India. The food here is similar to Indian food although this emphasizes meat but there are vegetarian and vegan options here too. I just found my favorite place in Queens for South Asian food.

Enter from Arthur Ave or Hughes Ave, start walking, and come to a stop when you see people drinking cold, refreshing beers. You made it.On a recent Saturday afternoon the bar was packed but my girlfriend and I managed to order a couple cold ones which we brought over to a barrel until room opened at a table. There's a lot of activity in this market: locals shopping for their daily groceries, regional visitors enjoying prosciutto sandwiches, tourists seeking the authentic Little Italy experience. You could spend hours in this market, trying new things, shopping for this and that, without ever getting bored.The selection includes a good variety of local (Bronx-brewed) beers, along with notable near-upstate breweries and other regional options. I was happy to try a couple of different things, all of which was served at an ideal temperature for quenching thirst. Prices are decent and there is a robust scene here. This is the kind of beer bar that has something for everyone: very inclusive, accommodating, and friendly."

I started with an offering from their draft menu, which was good stuff, and upgraded on my second brew to a special collab they had brewed with Gun Hill in cans - wow! Delicious. Lots of options around them in the Farmer's Market to grab a bite and have a seat and enjoy - this a hidden gem and I can't wait to get back. Thanks for starting my day in the Bronx off right!

It has a very genuine feel. The Bronx beer Hall fits right in with that authenticity.It's an excellent place for a guy to grab a beer.

I opted for their canned earl grey cider instead. Despite my skepticism about tea in apple cider, it somehow worked really well. The earl grey flavor was just strong enough. We also got their antipasto platter. It took a while to come but it was well plated and had a lot of delicious goodies on it. Their bread was so well toasted: perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. This was a fun experience and can't wait to come back"

My favorite flavor is sweet almond, but I decided to try the garlic and Parmesan pretzel. I wasn't a fan of it- I felt like there was a lot of garlic on it. I gave the other half to my sister and she enjoyed it. So I guess it's all preference. This location tends to have lines but there's usually 2 people working there- so line moves quickly!"
630,AxpsI4_tOI0sM6-KfOY9ig,4/5/2019,5 star rating,"Auntie Anne's was born 1 year after my birthday in 1988 fo Anne Beiler. She decided to buy a stand at a Pennsylvania farmer's market. It took some time for her to find her footing but she was able to create a masterpiece with her freshly baked recipes. Auntie Anne's pretzels are made on the spot. That means guaranteed freshness. If you're ever unhappy with your pretzel they will replace it, that's a promise. They offer a plethora of pretzels and drinks. There's Pretzel Buckets which are bite sized versions of your fav pretzel, Soft Pretzels such as: original, cinnamon sugar, pepperoni, jalapeño, raisin, sweet almond, roasted garlic & Parmesan, sour cream & onion. Pretzel Nuggets: original, cinnamon sugar, and pepperoni. Pretzel Dogs: original, cheese, jalapeño & cheese, and mini pretzel dogs. There's also Dips for your pretzels: caramel, cheese, hot salsa cheese, light cream cheese, marinara, sweet glaze, and honey mustard. There's a Pretzel Perks App available on Google Play and the App Store. The app offers exclusive offers and great rewards. Each purchase allows you to earn points toward free pretzels. You'll receive a free pretzel reward after you make your first purchase of at least $1.00. You also receive a FREE pretzel by earning 250 points. For every $1 spent it equals 10 points. You'll also receive a special perk on your birthday. Auntie Anne's I love you so much. I want y'all to cater my wedding lol. I love the pretzels because they're always so soft, buttery, and sprinkled with an amazing amount of tastiness. They actually offer catering services for any event. You can Party Size It with Pretzel Buckets, Pretzel Packages (classic pretzel or pepperoni pretzel), Pretzel Dogs (12 dogs or 24 dogs), Party Trays (one flavor tray, sampler tray, or sweet & salty tray), Dips (individual dips or dip sets), and Drinks (original lemonade, lemonade mixers, lemonade iced teas, iced tea - sweet or unsweetened)."

This particular auntie Anne's location is awesome because you have a little shopping center right there .some times you have a little line there but it is worth the wait. For all you snack lovers the smell of the fresh pretzels being made is on another level. From there cinnamon pretzels to the plane, or with the salt. These are truly some awesome pretzels ."

633,AxpsI4_tOI0sM6-KfOY9ig,4/26/2019,4 star rating,"First tried Auntie Anne's in Malaysia and thought it was awesome, so came for a snack at one of their nyc stores. I was disappointed that they didn't have the pretzel dog with chicken and cheese sausage but we tried their almond crunch and cinnamon/brown sugar pretzel. If only they combined these 2 into one pretzel, I think I could die happily haha xDAt $4~ not bad at all, I loved the chewy exterior with the soft centre, our were just made so we were lucky. If I had to pick out of the 2, I'd recommend the cinnamon and brown sugar, though I did like the textural component of the almond one.Are they the best pretzels you'll ever have? No, but they aren't bad. This location was great since it's in amongst stores like century21 and Costco. Currently they have a promotion on their website, valid until Sunday (I believe), where you can get a free pretzel with any purchase."
634,AxpsI4_tOI0sM6-KfOY9ig,12/31/2018,3 star rating,"The lady at the counter was very friendly and energetic. I was only there to get a free pretzel and I chose a cinnamon sugar one. I don't normally eat pretzels and these are extremely sweet, salty and buttery. I only took 2 bites. It was hot and it's good in small doses but so not healthy. Way too much sugar. It's literally covered in cinnamon sugar. I'm not sure who their ideal customer is... a child? A teen? But it's so sweet, you can't really have more than a few bites. I guess I should've gone with the plain one but that just seemed so boring...Tasty treat if u have a craving, but it's something to be shared based on their sodium, sugar, fat content unless you want diabetes."

They switched the lemonade for a warm Sprite can ! When I explained to them that it's now what I ordered they said the boss said to give sprite instead. Are you kidding me!? If you can't follow through with the promotions either don't participate or don't own a franchise. PATHETIC!!!

638,bKXnm2k44mSdU0fP69lY-g,3/29/2023,5 star rating,"This meal was honestly so good! We came around 2 on a Saturday and didn't have to wait very long. Their complimentary pickled cabbage and tea was so good, I think I had like 10 cups throughout the whole meal.I was scared the food wouldn't live up to the hype, but everything was so yummy! I think the sliced pork belly is a must and the eggplant with string beans are a good veggie to cut though the other spice.Szechuan spice isn't so much burning as it is numbing, so don't be intimidated. Try the items that sounds good, the spice is very tolerable!"
639,bKXnm2k44mSdU0fP69lY-g,3/31/2023,4 star rating,"The Szechuan Mountain House (川山甲) is one of my favorite restaurants in Flushing. The restaurant is well decorated and provides a really dedicate atmosphere for fine dining with classic Sichan style dishes. I love the decorations with bamboos, Chinese paintings, traditional style desks and chairs, a small stove on all tables boiling tea, and tea cups with a mixture feature of glass and china. The background music (though by recordings) is played by GuQin(古琴), an ancient Chinese musical instrument with thousands of years' history. With these around you it is natural to expect a great dining experience. I enjoyed two dishes in my most recent visit. First, Sliced Pork Belly in Garlic Sauce (蒜泥白肉). Carefully sliced, each pork belly piece as thin as around 0.5mm, which allows it to fully absorb the flavor of the garlic sauce. Sliced cucumber is served with bellies to provide fresh and crunchy tastes. However, the garlic sauce let me down a bit. It only contains chili oil and garlic, and the flavor is kind of plain. In classic Sichuan style cooking, the soul of this garlic sauce is a ""complex soy sauce(复制酱油)"", which is soy sauce re-boiled with brown sugar, spring onion, ginger, and other spices. The ""complex soy sauce"" is thicker than regular soy sauces and provides a super complex fragrance. I raised this point to the staff and hope they could improve in the future. Compared to the imperfect Sliced Pork Belly, I loved the other dish, La-Zi Chicken (辣子鸡). Small pieces of chicken, usually from wings, drums and thighs are marinated, coated with a thin layer of starch, deep fried, and stir fried a second time with a huge amount of Sichuan pepper and Chili pepper. This dish served here is almost perfect. If there's anything to improve, it must be using a mix of different varieties of chilis while it is a bit difficult given the supply of Chinese chilis here in America. As for drinks, I would highly recommend their Sydney Tea with Honey and Pear(蜂蜜雪梨菊花茶) which is a perfect match to spicy food."
640,bKXnm2k44mSdU0fP69lY-g,3/19/2023,4 star rating,"- spicy food overall, but surprisingly not THAT spicy for szechuan; usually it is mouth numbing- chicken dish had very little chicken- fish dish was well proportioned with a good amount of protein- the hanging pork appetizer was delicious, but the sauce was not that spicyOverall, superior service. They kept providing us napkins, tea, and got us what we needed quickly. I would have liked to have the food be a bit more spicy, but overall, delicious Szechuan."

Love the vibe and decoration. I felt like I came to Asia and was somewhere else, and not Flushing, while eating dinner! Absolutely loved it.5/5 food. The salad that comes out while waiting for the food we ordered was so good and refreshing, every dish portion size was good, price was affordable, and taste was all amazing. Everything tasted so authentic and flavorful, and each dish was so clean and well seasoned. I would definitely come back here for the dishes that I tried, and to try many of their other dishes! One thing to just note is that the mapo tofu here was PRETTY spicy.. and gave my tongue a tingly feeling! As I kept eating more, my water also started to taste a little funky and sparkly.. I really don't know what kind of spice they put in there to season it but don't get me wrong, it was absolutely delicious, but it just wasn't something that I was expecting! Overall, this place is awesome for Szechuan food. Don't forget to get their house special candies as you walk out!! It is also so yummy (:"

The service and attentiveness of the waiters here is 20/10. It reminds me of the service you expect at a Michelin star restaurant. They immediately bring you a cold sichuan appetizer of lettuce. After you order, the food comes out relatively fast. We ordered the Tempan Shrimp and they saw we were peeling it so not only did they offer to change our plates multiple times but as soon as we finished the dish, they gave us hand wipes and extra tissue. They also clear dishes out so the table isn't packed but it doesn't feel like theyre doing it to rush you out. The food is amazing, full of flavor and as someone who does NOT enjoy spicy food, I was willing to suffer through the delicious numbing sense for this. Definitely get the swinging pork belly dish! Highly recommend and will be returning!"
643,bKXnm2k44mSdU0fP69lY-g,10/24/2022,4 star rating,"Szechuan food is a dime a dozen in NYC (by far the most ubiquitous regional cuisine of China), so against that backdrop, SMH is above average but not mind-blowing. It's not quite on part with its Shanghai cousin, Che Li, but it's got a more extensive and diverse menu than the typical Szechuan restaurant.Standout dishes are the Mung Bean Jelly in a deliciously chilled mala sauce and the Beef Sour Soup--a giant cauldron of shredded meat, pickled veggies and pepper in a tangy, tart and tingly broth that easily feeds 2-4 people. A dry pot is sort of a must for Szechuan food, so we got the Szechuan Lamb Spine--but I wouldn't recommend it. Too much bone, too little meat and all of it drowning in dried pepper skins and peppercorns that no one would enjoy eating. The spiciness wasn't the issue (I've done spice challenges all over the country and won most of them), it was the boring-ness: no vegetables, no herbs, no additional seasonings or accompaniments of any kind. Just a big vat of peppers with a tiny side of meat.Service was above average too, with lots of fast, friendly attendants who granted our every request without making us feel rushed. Of course, the restaurant has that gorgeous, historic China decor that's so on trend in Flushing these days--so IGers will be doubly happy."
644,bKXnm2k44mSdU0fP69lY-g,12/2/2022,4 star rating,A solid choice for Szechuan Chinese food! Personally it was hyped up too much for me so it didn't fully live up to my expectations but they have good food nonetheless.- Sautéed Chinese Long Bean with Eggplant : very flavorful! Eggplant was a little too mushy for my liking but still good - Mapo Tofu- if you're looking for that numbing spice then this is perfect for you! was a pretty large serving as well and had plenty of leftover for dinner the next day - Country Braised Pork- my favorite dish of the night! the pork was tender and flavorful. Ate it so fast I forgot to take a picture when it came out!

Spicy yet delicious. So delicious that I could not stop eating even though I could no longer feel my tongue or taste what the food tastes like anymore. My tongue was literally numb.Came here on a night with my cousin, who loves to eat spicy. The night before we went in, we both looked at the menu from Yelp and tried to figure out what dishes to order. Everything looked delicious and we ended up ordering the Stir Fried Eel with Chili Peppers, Sour Soup, and the Sautéed Cabbage (cause veggies are a must even if they are stir fried).We really wanted to order the Slice Pork Belly in Chili Garlic Sauce but we already ordered too much for 2 people!The inside of the restaurant was also aesthetically pleasing to the eyes and the servers were attentive. Have already recommended this place to many people"

I walked out with that fuzzy head feeling and stomach burning but NO REGRETS (maybe a little). Order is from most spicy to least spicy1.) Jiang stew fish - fish was great but stew is undrinkable b/c its so spicy. Unless you have a superpower2.) la-zi chicken - chicken tastes so good. Highly recommend not to eat the chillis. 3.) Ma-po tofu - a little spicy but really good breather. Tastes great4.) Fried noodles - another good break from the spice and who doesn't love fried noodsOverall, great service and cute restaurant to sit at with groups. Had a great time here. I just wish the food was slightly more enjoyable because it was personally TOO spicy for me and i couldn't inhale the food like I usually do.Follow me on IG for food pics  @absandflab"
647,U8Ljrx-w5otdMZNFhw5piw,4/2/2023,4 star rating,"Had dinner at La Villa on Saturday night. A great Italian spot, which has all the rich and heavy dishes that you crave.Quality: Old school Italian joint that does a little of everything and where no one is going to complain. It took me time to finally visit because I was intimidated by the menu. The amount of pizza styles and options is overwhelming. However, from what they did with my Small Deep Dish Speciale Pizza, I think you can be confident in any style. It was the Fried Homemade Mozzarella though that would keep me coming back, it honestly doesn't get much better.Quantity: Everything comes in huge portions.Value: $14 for the Fried Homemade Mozzarella. $23 for the Small Deep Dish Speciale Pizza. Ambiance: La Villa is an Italian restaurant and pizza spot in Park Slope. It has a very casual atmosphere and old school vibes. There are always a few tables outside, but rarely do I see folks there. The majority of seating is inside in the long dining room. There are three separated areas including bar seating. There is also a space for take-out orders. A single television behind the counter played basketball and some pop traditional crooned in the background.Crowd: Busy on Saturday evening, I was lucky to snag a table.Service: Great, very friendly servers. They are also extremely fast with food orders.Parking: Limited street parking in the area."
648,U8Ljrx-w5otdMZNFhw5piw,3/4/2023,4 star rating,"Stepped in during a dinner rush, but luckily we were able to get seated. They provided focaccia as we were perusing through the menu. The focaccia was pretty bland, but it was a plus that it wasn't just plain bread. There were even two types: an herbed one and an onion one.There was an article about the Romana pizza posted at the front, so we decided on that. It was almost like a calzone but without sauce. It was hearty and satisfying. The potatoes had an almost creamy texture after being baked in olive oil. There was an ample amount of cheese that oozed out of each cut slice. The pepperoni and sausage provided the saltiness to the pizza. The crust was perfectly charred on the bottom. However, it is a bit tough to cut through the slices with their knives. We were worried that it wouldn't be enough, so we got an penne alla vodka pasta as well. The pasta was okay. Very much cheesy and smothered in sauce, but nothing too special.The portions are huge. One regular sized pizza can satisfy two people. Therefore, you also won't be spending over $30 per person on food. If you decide to just get pizza, you might be able to spend less than $20 per person. We didn't end up getting dessert because we were so stuffed. I ended up having leftovers for about 2 meals.If you ever find yourself in the neighborhood, La Villa is a prefect place to satisfy your hunger."

So we walked across the street and found la Villa.This place looks like it used to be a pizza store that they changed into a classy restaurant. But it does not feel like you have to be wearing a suit and tie to eat there. It was very bright light colors on the walls it was very relaxing. Our waiter was very prompt and took care of us and offered us a drink right off the menu we got to sample it before we got the wine. Despite being a Saturday the restaurant was not too crowded and felt like I had space and privacy. It was a little loud because of the music they play and people talking. We got started with some bread and olive oil which is always delicious and our appetizers also came delicious. Had mozzarella sticks which were cooked well and left a delicious taste in my mouth. For an entree I had the chicken parm with pasta which was delicious very well cooked not burnt. The outside was crispy without being hard and the chicken on the inside was juicy and flavorful well cooked. I was giving a large portion so I did have some food left over to take on me tomorrow, which I was not mad about. I felt that the price here were on par with other restaurants in the area charge for food, it's not somewhere I would go and spend money every week but every once in awhile I can see doing that.Five stars, I will be back"

The focaccia bread was a little on the matzoh side of texture that I'm used to for focaccias. The eggplant involtini is like a more detailed version of the eggplant parm and it works. The pizza was really disappointing. The whole thing was sopping wet and seemed like it had been steaming from the underside. The toppings just slid off and needed much assistance to get onto our plates. Again, really disappointing for a more upscale, family restaurant/pizzeria."
652,U8Ljrx-w5otdMZNFhw5piw,1/2/2023,4 star rating,"This place was super crowded when we went. We came with our friends from Philly. We shared calamari and a large pizza. The calamari was really good. The pizza was also decent, although there was something off about the crust. The crust was not crispy, and it just sort of went blah in your mouth. I'm sure it's not how it always is, maybe it was an off night. I should've gotten the pasta but everybody else wanted pizza so that's what we went with. It also wasn't super expensive so that's a plus.Service is quick, very New York style, just to the point. This is a place I would try again."
653,U8Ljrx-w5otdMZNFhw5piw,11/27/2022,4 star rating,I used to love this place but lately the prices have gone up way too much and they've gotten cheap with things like bread. I remember when you would get a nice big hunk of focccacia bread with an entree. Tonight I carried out and got this sad little piece of bread. Food still tastes good.

The pre-entree breads are the truth and the food I had (calzone, lasagna, meatball app, baked clam app) was good"

We decided to go out for dinner last minute and they were not too busy on a Saturday evening. They have a pretty big menu so it's great for families especially if you have kids and not everyone wants pasta or pizza. They offer complimentary focaccia bread which was very good compared to regular bread that other places give. We ordered fried calamari, a sausage pizza, chicken parm, veal parm and an oven roasted branzino (fish). Everything we ordered was good except the branzino. I don't know why I expected a whole fish versus filets which means it's frozen. But the fish was bland and it was on top of cooked lettuce? It just didn't taste right. Overall, food is good but I was a little disappointed they didn't bother to check vaccine cards which is the current mandate in NYC."

They have sandwiches, soup, and salad for food and coffee and tea for beverages. The grilled chicken panini was bland and nowhere near worth the $14.29.

I gave grace because they were so busy, and I'm glad she caught it before giving it to me. She quickly made another one with almond, and she apologized a few times.

The pasta and seafood were fresh and plentiful. It was phenomenal and definitely a must-try.  I devoured the whole thing without even taking a picture of it. Lol. Capricciosa looked really good as well. It looks like they put a lot of toppings on it. I can really see big chunks of artichoke, unlike the other places I have tried before. I'm definitely a fan of Sotto Le Stelle and looking forward to trying their other menu items. Ciao!"

Here are what we got:1.Fritto Misto - was okay :) 2. Tiella Pasta - yummy! Loved that it was baked in pizza dough (which was surprisingly tasty to eat with the pasta!) We just wish the portion was a bit bigger  Generous amount of seafood compared to the pasta. The sauce was addicting.3. Angel & Devil Pizza - SO. GOOD. The pizza was thin w/ crunchy crust. The center was so flavorful (maybe too much?) but we ate it with the crust so it evens out. 4. Tiramisu - delicious! But halfway into it, it tasted a bit too sweet. 5. Gelato (pistachio & hazelnut) - I wish there was more flavors but they were good! Smooth & melt in your mouth. I didn't know they have a dessert shop next door, I found out by noticing that the manager went out the restaurant & came back with out gelatos, which amusing to watch. Lol. But if you notice, they pass the desserts through a window by the bar. Oh! & we got 2 shots of limoncello on the house when we got our check! :) All the staff was very attentive, everyone was friendly, the food came out quick, & the experience was superb.

Quality over quantity!  Their menu consists of a variety of pizzas but the also offer antipasto, salads, sandwiches, and pastas.We tried 3 different pizzas and the Fritto Misto. They were all fantastic.  My one critique is that the middle of all of our pizzas were soggy. With all the wet ingredients, it's hard to keep a crisp crust. But I reheated my leftover pizza on a skillet the following day, and it tastes even better than the previous day! The crispy crust made the biggest difference. Nevertheless, the pizza ingredients and flavors were fabulous.Note: an after dinner visit next door to Arcobaleno Gelateria is a MUST! Their gelato & sherbets are wonderful."

Our orders also took forever, so much so that when they finally came out close to closing time the staff tried to get us to leave the dining area (we came well before close so just goes to show how long we were waiting). However they had FORGOTTEN my friends order, all the while trying to get us to leave. Staff also just made weird comments like ""I need your friend to take her receipt""... how about a ""could you give this to your friend?"" instead...?

There is always little white hairs on the bread!I can see them and also feel them in my mouth when I am chewing pulling out little white hairs.

I figured I'd do a review cause I'm not sure when I'll be able to come back since I just got an apartment in Brooklyn. These guys BUST their ASSES in the morning & they are so kind. I'm sure their job isn't easy & they work with each other so well so I'm kind of upset that people are giving them 1 star reviews for their service. I don't think those people understand the work they do.Both times I've come here, I've ordered the egg sandwich with bacon (cause I mean, who DOESN'T love bacon for breakfast) & a chicken lemon soup. And dude, $2.75 (egg sando) + $2.00 (small soup)??? You can't beat that. I've paid $5.75 for a soggy breakfast sandwich before & this one smokes it. Also, I love that they call me young lady, haha. It's the little things you know? So if you're ever out in this neighborhood & you're trying to get the best bang for your buck, this is the place for you. It's no 4/5 star restaurant, but if you add up all the other good things they do, they truly deserve the 4 stars. So get your breakfast on!"

This was my first time in Manhattan in over 10+ years and my first time going to The Full Shilling.The restaurant is quite large! As soon as you walk in, the restaurant immediately opens up to a bar and plenty of table seating. We had a party of 5, around lunch time at 12:30. We had no issues getting seated at the time and reservations weren't required. The service is tremendous! The team member at The Full Shilling seated us and provided menus. There were so many delicious items on their menu such as the shepherd's pie, but ultimately, I had to choose their corned beef sandwich on rye bread!The ambiance is loud and fun inside The Full Shilling! All of our meals came out in approximately 20 minutes. There was so much food! I couldn't finish the corned beef sandwich with a side of French Fries. The corned beef was flavorful! The rye bread enhance the overall meal. The French Fries were fried perfectly and seasoned well. Next time I stop at The Full Shilling, I'll need to order the Shephard's Pie!"

699,qpD22cY8CSXLT2qujiJtqw,4/10/2022,4 star rating,"I would fully expect an Irish pub like The Full Shilling to be in Sunnyside or Woodside but instead it's situated all the way in the downtown of Manhattan. It is a place that is ideal for drinks and a hearty meal in a super casual setting. It is a quality option for afterwork shindigs for Wall Streeters and downtown residents.The exterior is a bit deceiving, as it doesn't give away how big this place really is. The bar is extensive, stocked with spirits with a nice sized counter. Apart from the bar, the dining room is pretty spacious and enough to catch most people by surprise. It's not the most well lit in here, but that's the plus side of an intimate feel in pub fashion.Irish pub with a bar bite feel is the best way I can describe their food. Their sandwiches and burgers are their biggest winners but folks looking for something light or hearty are sure to find it on this menu. I haven't tried their shepherd's pie just yet, but I've heard good things. Drinks wise, the standard run of the mill options are available and they most certainly have Guinness on tap.Service is the strongest asset. The bartenders are friendly, the managers are professional, and the crowds are never too overwhelming here. Keeping it casual is almost always going to merit good results for this place, but always keep expectations reasonable."

The inside decor is cool, with the paneling and walls flown in from Dublin. It's pretty much your standard pub set up, but the fact that there's not a whole lot of places to go out at in the area, this may be one of your best bets, if your hotel happens to be around here, which mine was. Didn't get a chance to try the food, just stopped in for a beer. I'm sure there's cooler places if you'd venture uptown, but if just looking to stay in this area one night, one of your better options I'd say"

The full shilling was right around the corner from our apartment, and definitely met our needs. We got them right at the open and start happy hour, so seating was really easy. They have a really fun outdoor seating space, but it was way too hot outside to be there!Happy hour is just for drinks, without any food choices. However, their food options are reasonably priced compared to where we were in Philadelphia. Fish tacos, fish and chips, Cobb salad were solid choices. The french fries were a bit soggy, but it came with a side of ketchup and tartar sauce that were well seasoned. Cobb salad was a little warm for my taste, but the portion size was awesome. We accommodated putting a blue cheese on the side and gave me a great portion to. We definitely come back here for happy hour and food."

Shepherds pie was hot, just the right size for the big manly appetite of my date. Mashed potatoes were fresh and light.  Meat filling was juicy.  No peas in the pie- carrots were crunchy and yummy though. Our friends had burgers that were perfectly cooked on fresh buns. It was nice that it wasn't crowded and we could all talk.  The music was not too loud and the bar crowd was chill."

At the price for ayce lunch, I didn't have high expectations but the salmon rolls looked pretty sad. The fish color wasn't very bright, it was kind of gray. The eel was also very much just covered in sauce so it could have been any cooked white fish. I will say that the service is very quick and things couple out pretty ask after an order was put in. We came on a Saturday for lunch and there were only a couple of other tables occupied."
711,BYOxFf1eg66kWDK8KOvNeQ,2/21/2022,4 star rating,"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I always walk by this restaurant but I guess they recently became an all you can eat sushi spot! It's basically $27 per person and you get a paper menu to indicate how many of each item you would like. I love salmon so I started off with like 12 pieces of salmon sashimi among others and ordered a bunch of specialty rolls as well as standard maki rolls like salmon avocado rolls. I was so surprised when the server brought the sushi and sashimi out. They give you nice thick cuts of fish and do not skimp out on the portions. On the rolls, it's a thin layer of rice with plenty of fish inside the rolls. The sushi is seasoned pretty well for an all you can eat restaurant. We also tried some of their hot foods. The shrimp tempura and fried calamari was good. The seafood udon was ok, would probably just stick to eating sushi. We finished off the meal with some ice cream. I think the service is good and the food is good so would recommend this place!"

Service 1/5 ; We were a pretty big party and when they seated us, they said ""oh, shit."" Should've been the first red flag to leave. We did not get water for about 5 minutes until we asked. The male server seemed like he didn't want to be there. We ordered twice. Both times, they missed many items that we ordered. When we told the waiter the first time, she didn't bother checking with the kitchen and instead just told us to submit another order. Food 1/5 ; We ordered rock shrimp maybe twice, first time it was tossed in the sauce, the second time it was not. Talk about consistency. Edamame was not salted. Gyoza was cold. Yellowtail tasted spoiled. The ""boat"" the food gets served in looks terrible. The areas where the screws are are rusty and the sides look moldy. Ambiance 0/5 ; Dingy. No music. Bathroom door has a slit that feels like someone can peek through and see everything. To top it off, 5 of us got food poisoning for the next 2 days and shit our brains out."

They're now putting the masago sashimi on top of a cucumber instead of in a spoon. So if you're not fond of cucumbers don't order it. Big pieces and freshly chopped spicy tuna and spicy salmon. Chunks of fish mixed with spicy sauce. This is truly what sets Super Sushi apart from everyone else's paste.

We had chicken udon/soba soup, rock shrimp, shumai, kani salad, gyoza, sashimi, and special rolls. Everything was delicious. Only thing I didn't like was the seaweed salad that tasted off. We will absolutely be back! For only $30 pp and you can keep on ordering as much as you like but just don't go overboard since they don't allow you to take anything home, and it says they charge for overage. Although we had a couple pieces of leftover rice that we picked out fish from the sushi, they didn't say anything about. This will be our new go to sushi spot! Had we gone to Fushimi it would of cost us triple the amount of $$$!They don't have their liquor license so just enjoy the food (or sneak in a Gatorade bottle) lol."

716,BYOxFf1eg66kWDK8KOvNeQ,12/11/2021,3 star rating,"Came here on a Saturday night and it was pretty much empty except for one other table. We were seated in the back so it felt like we had the entire restaurant to ourselves. We ordered from the ayce menu, which is two sheets of paper. One consisted of the appetizers,  tempura, and dessert, while the other was sushi, sashimi and the rolls. Each adult was $27 pp and after tip and tax it came out to be $100 for 3 people. Not too bad for ayce but missing a drink menu. So if you're looking for sake or beer, you won't find it here.We ordered a number of appetizers to try but didn't take pictures of them all. First we order the rock shrimp which is just fried shrimp with mayo. IF you get the yuzu salmon salad too, dip the rock shrimp into the yuzu sauce and it makes it taste way better. The missing flavor is fulfilled. With that said, we had the yuzu salmon salad which was quite refreshing with the citrus taste of the yuzu. We also had the crab rangoon which wasn't a table favorite as a friend said they did it wrong but it varied among the party. We had chicken nuggets as well which is your typical frozen nuggets from the store. Gyoza had mixed reviews, it was perfectly cooked but someone didn't like the filling. Fried calamari was interesting as the pieces were huge and the sauce was citrusy ad well. The BBQ squid wasn't consistent as some pieces were overcooked but that's due to the different parts of the squid itself. I personally thought the sauce was a little salty and needed rice on the side.The sushi themselves were good as the fish did taste fresh. There is one issue tho...this was mentioned in other reviews... the first round, the fish to rice ratio was pretty good, but when round 2 came along, there was much more rice... The eel sushi wasn't that great either as the sauce was slightly different from the usual you'd get from other places.. to me it was slightly tangy.Edamame was made fresh and wasn't overly salted. The ginger dressing on the salad was the Chinese kind without miso.. or so my friend said...Overall the best part were the squid and red clam. I'm disappointed they didn't have scallop on their menu as it's one of my favorites. The fish was fresh though but the tuna's color wasn't the freshest. Their ice cream was great, green tea had the strong matcha flavor, the red bean tasted like plum which was quite refreshing, and the vanilla reminded me of Kirkland vanilla ice cream... if you know what that tastes like.Service wise was pretty good since there wasn't anyone else there except during the staff's dinner time which they didn't really notice us."

After waiting the summer for my favorite pie shop to open after renovating, I have the following comments. I ordered pie slices for two people to go. Two lemon meringue, a blueberry, and a sour cherry.The positives:The blueberry and sour cherry were amazing. The crust was tasty as well as the filling. I have to mention the crust because most places make a mess of it. It was quite tasty. The filling was on point with just the right amount of sweetness and tartness.The negatives:The lemon meringue pie was weeping so there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the tray. The meringue separated from the filling. The was a salty element and pronounced egg flavor that was not good.The pie slices were extremely small for the amount of money you pay! You barely got any filling.  My goodness it was a tease!Would I buy again? Not anytime soon. My money has to go a little further and I need to feel like I'm getting my money's worth."

My favorite is probably the black bottom almond chess, which also seems to have captured the hearts of many other Yelpers. Anything fruit is also good; plus, it makes you feel like you're eating a little healthier, right?Their set-up for COVID-19 is very sound. They have lots of notices saying only individuals or very small parties are allowed in at one time. The menu is posted outside, too, so you can figure out what you want before entering. (There's also a menu inside, of course.) And there's plexiglass above the counter where you order. It's always a great time to treat yo'self. You can't go wrong here!"

(???!!!???)So enough is enough, I started to shout back at her that she could call the cops, that this was not a nice way to talk to their customers, bla, bla, bla. The absurdity continue and she kept screaming on the store for us to leave and came near to me and said  that if she called the cops, things would not look good to us!

740,65VJnrsaHS6NZejxnnu23A,3/9/2020,2 star rating,"People make fun of me for reviewing Starbucks locations, but they definitely have their own distinct personalities, as exemplified by this one. I've been going to this one for a couple of years due to convenience for meetings and for another four years when I was at NYU for undergrad, and it has not changed or improved since 2008. It is so crowded and low on available space because of the eighteen-year-olds who apparently need so much caffeine that they're willing to be late to class for it (no, that was never me and it never will be). I've always felt that it's a status thing to come here and get coffee, and I still get that sense walking in here. The line is absurd, always. If you wait ten minutes on the line, consider yourself lucky. You also need to wait awkwardly for a seat, but once you snatch one, it most likely won't be near an outlet. There are a few sofas and several chairs by the big windows, so that allows for some fun people-watching. That's a plus that makes me prefer this one over the Union Square one. Service is always slow and grouchy, probably because they're dealing with students all day long, but still, it's unpleasant to deal with. Coffee is always burnt; lattes are rarely smooth and generally have too much milk. Last few times I've come, cups weren't filled to the brim. The bathroom is where homeless people clean themselves, so you truly have to hold your nose when you go in. I don't get why they don't clean the bathrooms throughout the day, because it is atrocious in there. FYI, this location doesn't take rewards points, because it's an NYU franchise. Doesn't affect me, but thought to throw that out there."

I went in to pick up my drink on a busy afternoon when everyone had gotten out of class. My friend came with me, and we arrived when our orders were already ready. There's a long line of people waiting around, but I would always walk up to pick up my order as soon as it was ready in previous visits and so would everyone else.This day specifically, my friend did it too. However, when I did it, I was first told aggressively and derogartorily by one employee that ""Everybody in line is here to pick up their ready orders"". Because of my previous experience, I assumed that I could just walk up because mine was done and my friend did the same thing. So, I walk away and decide to wait in the line. But the same employee yells at me asking me what my order number is, only so that I can pick it up and get yelled at by the other employees they've gathered over.Three other employees yell at me infront of everyone, one telling me that ""just so that you know for next time, everyone here is in line to pick up their orders"" and acted like I'm the stupidest and most ignorant person to exist. Well thanks for telling me that, but I won't be back next time. I'm not a person with malicious intent, and I hate being understood for having it. I wasn't aware that specifically that day out of all the times I've visited, would be the day where people just idle around when their drinks are ready. I understand that the employees were stressed due to the rush, but that doesn't mean they get to take it out on their customers.

However, every seat was taken already by people.As I walked in I hear one of the baristas shouting free frappe for anyone who comes first to get it. The cashier that took my order greeted me but was not very warming. I ordered a caramel macchiato with almond milk. She didn't bother saying thank you or next. She just stared at me until I walked away. I got my drink fairly fast. When I was waiting for my drink, one of the baristas came out with food orders that customers requested and hand delivered it to them. This is the first Starbucks branch where the barista hands the food to the customer. Most Starbucks employees just called the customers name and wait for them to pick it up themselves. The employee who handed me my drink was a lot nicer than the cashier. Overall the environment was very clean but it's a busy branch so it's hard to find seats."

""She's asking if your paying with the app!"" At this point I'm like I know what she said. Then the girl with the black hair tells me I need to relax and starts running her mouth.

Drinks take forever and when a mobile order is finally ready they call out your name and put it just behind the counter where only staff can go. When you try to get their attention they ignore you!!! So guess you just have stare at your drink right in front of you for ten minutes until one of them bothers to acknowledge the crowds of people gathering by the pick up counter for their now cold drinks??

However, every seat was taken already by people.As I walked in I hear one of the baristas shouting free frappe for anyone who comes first to get it. The cashier that took my order greeted me but was not very warming. I ordered a caramel macchiato with almond milk. She didn't bother saying thank you or next. She just stared at me until I walked away. I got my drink fairly fast. When I was waiting for my drink, one of the baristas came out with food orders that customers requested and hand delivered it to them. This is the first Starbucks branch where the barista hands the food to the customer. Most Starbucks employees just called the customers name and wait for them to pick it up themselves. The employee who handed me my drink was a lot nicer than the cashier. Overall the environment was very clean but it's a busy branch so it's hard to find seats."

I was taken back a bit with the ton and also because  I've never been asked that at Starbucks before. The girl with the black hair proceeds to say in an also really shitty tone. ""She's asking if your paying with the app!"" At this point I'm like I know what she said. Then the girl with the black hair tells me I need to relax and starts running her mouth. Having a confrontation was the last thing I expected when I walked in here. The fact you let these ppl work for you is insane. Worst customer service I've probably ever had.

(???!!!???)So enough is enough, I started to shout back at her that she could call the cops, that this was not a nice way to talk to their customers, bla, bla, bla. The absurdity continue and she kept screaming on the store for us to leave and came near to me and said  that if she called the cops, things would not look good to us! Whaaaaaaaatttt????Obviously at this moment, my kids were terrified  and sad for such a horrible experience and we decided to leave that place and that despicable human being. How on earth does Starbucks let a crazy woman like that work serving it's customers?I urge Starbucks District Manager to see their security camera footage from today 06:30 pm for them to witness how their staff is treating and threatening its customers and their families."

I told them straight out that every single Starbucks that I had ever been to had gluten-free drinks. They said I could get matcha, but that had caffeine in it. Honestly, this location knows absolutely nothing about their allergen information, and I could have sworn that they just made that up on the spot without actually looking at the allergen information binder that they are supposed to have. I obviously didn't order anything because they clearly weren't even trying. Major disappointment."

800,65VJnrsaHS6NZejxnnu23A,3/9/2020,2 star rating,"People make fun of me for reviewing Starbucks locations, but they definitely have their own distinct personalities, as exemplified by this one. I've been going to this one for a couple of years due to convenience for meetings and for another four years when I was at NYU for undergrad, and it has not changed or improved since 2008. It is so crowded and low on available space because of the eighteen-year-olds who apparently need so much caffeine that they're willing to be late to class for it (no, that was never me and it never will be). I've always felt that it's a status thing to come here and get coffee, and I still get that sense walking in here. The line is absurd, always. If you wait ten minutes on the line, consider yourself lucky. You also need to wait awkwardly for a seat, but once you snatch one, it most likely won't be near an outlet. There are a few sofas and several chairs by the big windows, so that allows for some fun people-watching. That's a plus that makes me prefer this one over the Union Square one. Service is always slow and grouchy, probably because they're dealing with students all day long, but still, it's unpleasant to deal with. Coffee is always burnt; lattes are rarely smooth and generally have too much milk. Last few times I've come, cups weren't filled to the brim. The bathroom is where homeless people clean themselves, so you truly have to hold your nose when you go in. I don't get why they don't clean the bathrooms throughout the day, because it is atrocious in there. FYI, this location doesn't take rewards points, because it's an NYU franchise. Doesn't affect me, but thought to throw that out there."
801,65VJnrsaHS6NZejxnnu23A,11/7/2021,1 star rating,"I'm only giving one star because the drink I ordered was fine. I went in to pick up my drink on a busy afternoon when everyone had gotten out of class. My friend came with me, and we arrived when our orders were already ready. There's a long line of people waiting around, but I would always walk up to pick up my order as soon as it was ready in previous visits and so would everyone else.This day specifically, my friend did it too. However, when I did it, I was first told aggressively and derogartorily by one employee that ""Everybody in line is here to pick up their ready orders"". Because of my previous experience, I assumed that I could just walk up because mine was done and my friend did the same thing. So, I walk away and decide to wait in the line. But the same employee yells at me asking me what my order number is, only so that I can pick it up and get yelled at by the other employees they've gathered over.Three other employees yell at me infront of everyone, one telling me that ""just so that you know for next time, everyone here is in line to pick up their orders"" and acted like I'm the stupidest and most ignorant person to exist. Well thanks for telling me that, but I won't be back next time. I'm not a person with malicious intent, and I hate being understood for having it. I wasn't aware that specifically that day out of all the times I've visited, would be the day where people just idle around when their drinks are ready. I understand that the employees were stressed due to the rush, but that doesn't mean they get to take it out on their customers. Even if it weren't an employee-customer interaction, no one should be publically humiliated like the way I was at this Starbucks."

I normally grab some classic New York coffee from the cart across the street, but he usually takes a bit to make it, so I just darted here. This place is huge, I can't imagine what it's like if you can sit indoors. Service was a bit rude, they're all yelling at you for your order and want you to gtfo asap. I can't blame them, they're front line workers and are constantly exposed. I order, they take it, 2 minutes later, my order comes out. Wham, Bam, Thank you ma'am!I'm not a big fan of chains, if you check my reviews, I rarely ever have any. I'm into supporting local businesses more.

Of course i got charged and they tell me ""we dont take reward points here"". great staff...-poor staff service. see above-coffee taste burnt.- inconsistent prepration.  i had ice coffee more than once here. once it came with sweetner. the other time it did not. they did not ask me both times how I would like it.-drinks were underfilledcmon NYU, with all the money students are paying you, I've recieved better food service from... public institutions."

I'm sorry I just paid $8 for an overpriced coffee. If I want some ice then stop and get ice for a customer! Not only that but they yelled at customers from behind the counter?! Wtf is going on here? Can someone train these employees how to act right?!!!?!!!!!!!! Every time i come it's the and exact experience but today was exceptionally worse.

818,_-89MKTICre2Gj6Mq-qhDA,10/2/2021,3 star rating,"Visited Commonwealth with friends on Saturday evening. A decent dive bar, but it has a limited music selection and the outdoor area closes early.Quality: Commonwealth is a pretty standard dive bar with a few unique factors. They have a large outdoor patio, as well as some added sidewalk tables, they have several pinball machines, though I didn't see many people utilizing them, and they had a few local craft beers to go with standard domestic selections.Quantity: They serve up an assortment of simple and strong cocktails.Value: $12-$15 for Cocktails.Ambiance: Commonwealth is a dive bar located in the Park Slope area of Brooklyn. They have two outdoor areas, a large deck with a massive umbrella in the center and some tables set up along the sidewalk. Both are smoker friendly, so expect cigarette smoke throughout the night. Inside the space is arranged a little strange, but it may be to create distance between guests during COVID. There are a few scattered tables and a few pinball machines near the path to the back patio. They also had a jukebox, but it is almost entirely hard rock and heavy metal.Crowd: On Saturday night a large crowd gathered, but as soon as they closed the outdoor patio, it emptied quick.Service: The bartenders were fast and efficient. Parking: Limited street parking in the area."

It's honestly a vibe of its own, I would say it's more than your local dive bar in south slope, maybe even a type of second home or pilgrimage type of place. The classic toys are all arranged across the top of room looking down at you and into your soul kind of like a ritual, perhaps you are the sacrifice that is being made? Anyways, I'm totally not a local but while visiting Brooklyn I fell in love with this place and wanted to go back for another round of the fruity flavored ciders. I had a strawberry cider that had the perfect balance of sweetness and alcohol. The ciders were the perfect night cap to an eventful evening, the bar tender was super sweet, cute young lady compared to myself. They have an outdoor patio as well, it was a bit too chilly for me to enjoy during that day but perhaps one day again soon I shall return to pay tribute to this gem of a find in Brooklyn. Cheers to Commonwealth!"

Stellar jukebox, A+ happy hour, big backyard, cool bartenders that warm up to friendly regulars, and of course, free popcorn. Leaving this review specifically today, because I witnessed the bartender handle an aggressive, rude customer with an unruly child in a very levelheaded manner (much more level that I would've). Funny thing is, I've seen plenty of parents and families with well-behaved kids, and the bar staff is always friendly with them. I was really impressed by how the bartender handled the customer situation, and it reminded me why I love Commonwealth: If you're respectful and chill, you'll get great treatment here. If you're an entitled, aggro Park Slope parent...you'll be shown the door. And that's a thing of beauty. Keep being amazing, Commonwealth!

All their food is prepared right in front of you; grilled & roasted to perfection & their entire kitchen is in open view so ya know they are super clean all their salads & sides are very appetizing to the eye !!  The servers are very friendly & knowledgeable of their  menu just in case you are unfamiliar with it...I had the mixed grilled plate with 7 assorted delicious grilled meats with their Turkish eggplant & Jerusalem salad as my sides.The ladies both had the Chicken Shawarma with rice & fries as their sides ....We all were very satisfied with our meals & service ..What to expect; 1A; Parking; Good Luck we drove around for 20 minutes to get a spot; definitely was worth it...1; very busy restaurant both with outgoing & in-house.2; very loud Egyptian music playing which we loved & enjoyed...3; gratuity / tip;  FYI, heads up that it's included in the bill...... Highly recommend and  we will definitely be returning to explore their menu...Thanks,Greg D & family"

Don't order tap water because they don't serve tap water ( as much as I know New York water is drinkable). We order to start hummus and falafel, The hummus was full of oil and the falafel was too greasy. We did not eat the falafel and still paid for it. I order the beef shawarma and I could not enjoyed it ( It had too much tahini sauce). Someone recommended to me this place, to be honest I expected more. The service was good, but the food is not to die for. Fyi: Bring cash to tip your server, otherwise the business keep the money you leave on the card."
830,3FzpZE56CHuipiY_JDT3EA,2/18/2023,5 star rating,"The crowds or lack thereof on Steinway Street tell you all you need to know about any given establishment. The ever-present hookah bars are either packed to the brim or so empty that you wouldn't want to step in. And as far as food, I knew I had found a suitable replacement for the now-shuttered El Rawsheh when I saw a long line of hungry patrons at the front of Zyara, watching the scooping of mezzes with anticipation.I went for the vegetarian mezze platter, including felefel, hummus, and the Turkish eggplant. The hummus is topped with a bit of zhug along with olive oil, and was incredibly rich. The felefel were perfectly crispy, and were enjoyed both by themselves as well as with a scoop of labneh (not pictured). The Turkish eggplant was less rich than the other items, but provided a nice contrast to the other mezzes on offer."
831,3FzpZE56CHuipiY_JDT3EA,2/5/2023,5 star rating,Excellent. Satisfied the curb. Chicken Adana and kabob was so good as was the rice. Crowded on a Sunday night. Service was sweet and efficient.

He was nice to the customers, no complaints there, but I feel bad for the kitchen staff They actually helped make amazing food, I think they deserve a little more respect."
833,3FzpZE56CHuipiY_JDT3EA,1/3/2023,5 star rating,So nice of them for letting us dine-in even if it was just take-out hours. This hit the spot after having long flights on the Christmas weekend. Authentic and clean!

Even though they were undergoing some renovation, the lady at the counter permitted us to eat-in. Would definitely come back for more."
835,3FzpZE56CHuipiY_JDT3EA,9/26/2022,3 star rating,"So, we went at like 11pm & they had no seats so we had to takeout. We all got mixed grill which wuda been better if they hadn't put a mayo based sauce on both meats. The chicken was good. The beef was dry since it was over cooked. We asked for hummus but they gave us baba ganoush which was good, no big deal. Also got a plain yogurt drink since they either don't have or ran out of the mango one. The plain yogurt is salty & Unpleasing to my palate."
836,3FzpZE56CHuipiY_JDT3EA,2/6/2022,4 star rating,"Hidden Gem Alert Food is delicious, savory, authentic, and worth a trip.However the customer service and lack of people handling skills leaves a lot to be desired. The workers are all extremely rude and take forever to acknowledge your presence in their establishment. Try the lamb kofta with hummus and rice ...pricey at $18 but worth it."

First time at the Dumbo location on Saturday night and was pleased by the ""out of the way"" location and an ambient inside. Doing a ""Plate"" is my favorite because you can choose 2 of the house vegetables with each plate. Highly recommend the Yucca fries and pesto mashed potatoes!!!! Drinks are fantastic as well. My girlfriend had the hot toddy and it was a unique but tasty drink"
838,56qlj1cYlqNzmG0xllGg-w,12/12/2022,5 star rating,"Very good experience in this restaurant.We were looking for a quality restaurant in the Dumbo area, and we were very pleasantly surprised. This restaurant offers very diversified fast food, with a lot of different vegetables from the market, which was very appreciated by my girlfriend because she is vegetarian.I had a meal with chicken and a choice of two market vegetables, I chose zucchini with mozzarella and cherry tomatoes, and a roasted sweet potato, and my girlfriend chose a dish with a choice of 4 market vegetables, with fried sweet potatoes, zucchini with mozzarella and cherry tomatoes, tofu and mashed potatoes. The quality of the dishes was really good, and the service was very fast as we waited only 10 minutes after ordering our dishes.We also had a beer and we got it for about $60 for two, which is very reasonable. I would definitely recommend!"
839,56qlj1cYlqNzmG0xllGg-w,10/12/2022,4 star rating,"Good lighter fare option in DUMBO!We had a heavy lunch and still felt it so wanted something light and somewhat healthy.We got market plate (brussel sprouts, butternut squash, tofu, and beets) plus hot dog combo with zucchini. Hot dogs were juicy with the free raw onion sauerkraut and relish add on but the zucchini was somewhat bland. The market plate was similar; expected more savory or sweet with the options but I think it just needed some salt and pepper. Otherwise the plate was refreshing with good contrasting textures. Four selections out of a pretty large list gives you lots of options to try different combos!We came in time for happy hour (5-7) and got some sangria!"
840,56qlj1cYlqNzmG0xllGg-w,2/25/2023,4 star rating,"After a long and cold evening walk on Brooklyn bridge, on a friend's recommendation we visited Westville. Very soothing and pleasant ambience and enough seating. We asked Barista for vegetarian friendly options and got some suggestions. Ordered a Quinoa patty burger and a market plate with mushrooms, tofu, Brussels sprouts and zucchinis. The market plate was healthy veg option and it was tasty too. Fries were well cooked and crisp. However we didn't like the quinoa patty, it was bland and not adding any taste to the buns. Overall I felt, if you are feeling like eating little healthy and tasty food this could be a good place."
841,56qlj1cYlqNzmG0xllGg-w,9/27/2022,5 star rating,"I have only positive things to to say about Westville Dumbo. First, it's the perfect location if you want to explore Dumbo for the day. Second, the restaurant itself is so cute. I particularly love their outdoor dining space with picnic tables. Third is that it has a good number of vegan/ vegetarian options. The staff was able to accommodate many substitutions at our table. Last, and of course the most important, the food is wonderful. They have a many specials to try as well. For brunch, I absolutely loved the California Benedict. If you love hasbrowns like I do, be sure to order an extra side of them if they are not included with your breakfast."
842,56qlj1cYlqNzmG0xllGg-w,12/13/2022,4 star rating,"I've had this place multiple times and really love their vegan burgers. I'm lactose intolerant so the vegan cheese does wonders for me and their bun + patty are always unique and yummy. I loved the lentil soup and their truffle parm fries. When I'm feeling healthy, I get their market plate with 4 different veggies and get super filled. The carrot cake was gluten free and still super moist but the frosting on top was too sweet. Overall would recommend this place!!"

The staff was friendly, attentive, and accommodating. We went for brunch and the food did not disappoint. All of their menu options are great and they have a surprising variety of drink options too. We had an assortment of items off of the menu, a bowl, platter, and eggs Benedict with iced coffee, tea, and beer. All of it was delicious!We had a reservation, but at 10:45 it wasn't too crowded so we might not have needed it. But it did pick up as we ate, which isn't surprising for a Saturday. Next time you are in the area, definitely eat here. It was great!"
844,56qlj1cYlqNzmG0xllGg-w,10/30/2022,5 star rating,"We've been regulars here -- there's outdoor seating, loads of vegetable combos in the market vegetables, and they add seasonal options that make sense. During a recent visit, we ordered the heath tea, mulled wine (there's another name), the yuca fries with chipotle mayo (best as an appetizer), salmon with kale with spinach ( + shallots & pumpkin seeds) and asparagus. Plus, a burger and salad. The server was genuinely nice and the food came quickly. We've been coming regularly and in all but two times (this summer they must have been short staffed), we have had truly amazing experiences. I appreciate consistent food and healthy options -- and Westville Dumbo delivers on this."

I ended up getting the C.B.L.T sandwich with a side of arugula salad. Huge portions with fresh-tasting ingredients. The sandwich was pretty yummy."

The biggest complaint I had is we're on the patio and there was a draft of cold air where we were and they were only serving brunch till 4pm. We weren't looking for breakfast food because it was 2 pm so it was basically burgers or salads. The salad was good, the dressing was tasty but nothing special!"

Despite franchising out, the quality of the pizza remains, what was lacking during my visit however was staff.Quality: Patsy's Pizzeria serves up an iconic New York style pie. It is thin and crispy, expect the edges to be burnt. A lot of crunch to the texture, but just enough softness to work. The cheese and sauce are both excellent, and they don't skimp on ingredients. I went with the Patsy's Pizzeria Special, which adds pepperoni and basil, which were both great. Quantity: A pie is enough for two if you order an appetizer.Value: $30 for Patsy's Pizzeria Special.Ambiance: Visited the original Patsy's Pizzeria location in Harlem. They have a take-out window as well as a full service sit down space. The sit down space has two rows of tables in the first room, and then some additional tables in a room next to it. The walls are lined with photos of celebrities and family. Classic rock music played in the background.

Being that it's survived almost 90 years on 1st Avenue, I had to get out there and give it a try. They have a restaurant section and two takeout windows - one for Ubereats and Seamless order-a heads and one for in-person to-go orders. Ordering ahead on Ubereats proved to be the better choice as there was no one at that window when I arrived. I ordered a regular pie which traveled about 20-25 mins from oven to door. The car ride banged it up a little per my picture below. I reheated it in my oven for about 8 minutes. I have to say: the fact that it had such a smoky flavor without excessive char was very impressive. It was super thin and had a nice crunch at the top. The sauce was on the tangier side. I can see why they are held in such high regard!I also ordered some fried calamari which was delicious!Although Patsy's was a little bit out of the way, I would gladly return for their amazing pie!"

And at the quality they bring & reasonable price, I see why this place is so popular! At just $10 for a whole pizza, this place  is a steal. The crust isn't cracker crisp like some NY slices, which is good for me because I prefer the light, airy, chewy crunch that places like Patsy's offer. They had plenty of seasonings to spice up my slice with, so I threw them all on & crammed down a delicious slice of coal fired pizza. This may not be the best pizza I've ever had, but at $2.25 a slice and $10 a pizza, it's worth every penny. Absolutely worth a stop, even in a city filled with good pizza"

They have a restaurant section and two takeout windows - one for Ubereats and Seamless order-a heads and one for in-person to-go orders. Ordering ahead on Ubereats proved to be the better choice as there was no one at that window when I arrived. I ordered a regular pie which traveled about 20-25 mins from oven to door. The car ride banged it up a little per my picture below. I reheated it in my oven for about 8 minutes. I have to say: the fact that it had such a smoky flavor without excessive char was very impressive. It was super thin and had a nice crunch at the top. The sauce was on the tangier side. I can see why they are held in such high regard!I also ordered some fried calamari which was delicious!Although Patsy's was a little bit out of the way, I would gladly return for their amazing pie!"

I only bad $3 on me, which was enough to buy a $2.25 slice. Even at 9pm on an empty street in Harlem, there were people lining up to get some Patsy's. And at the quality they bring & reasonable price, I see why this place is so popular! At just $10 for a whole pizza, this place  is a steal. The crust isn't cracker crisp like some NY slices, which is good for me because I prefer the light, airy, chewy crunch that places like Patsy's offer. They had plenty of seasonings to spice up my slice with, so I threw them all on & crammed down a delicious slice of coal fired pizza. This may not be the best pizza I've ever had, but at $2.25 a slice and $10 a pizza, it's worth every penny. Absolutely worth a stop, even in a city filled with good pizza"

877,Kh0-HmlgmVUkRxR55_Vn1g,4/1/2023,4 star rating,"Had dinner at Patsy's Pizzeria on Thursday night. Despite franchising out, the quality of the pizza remains, what was lacking during my visit however was staff.Quality: Patsy's Pizzeria serves up an iconic New York style pie. It is thin and crispy, expect the edges to be burnt. A lot of crunch to the texture, but just enough softness to work. The cheese and sauce are both excellent, and they don't skimp on ingredients. I went with the Patsy's Pizzeria Special, which adds pepperoni and basil, which were both great. Quantity: A pie is enough for two if you order an appetizer.Value: $30 for Patsy's Pizzeria Special.Ambiance: Visited the original Patsy's Pizzeria location in Harlem. They have a take-out window as well as a full service sit down space. The sit down space has two rows of tables in the first room, and then some additional tables in a room next to it. The walls are lined with photos of celebrities and family. Classic rock music played in the background. Crowd: About half the tables full on Thursday evening and a small line at the window.Service: In desperate need of more servers. The one person working was doing his best, but everyone was frustrated by the delays.Parking: Plenty of parking in the nearby area."

I only see regular pies. Weird but okay. I ask for a slice and he hands it right to me. I like my pizza HOT & CRISPY. So naturally I ask him to heat it up. Lord please tell me why this man told me they don't reheat pizza? I HAVE NEVER BEEN TOLD THIS IN MY ENTIRE LIFE OF LIVING IN NYC! So I go ""are you serious"" and with the nastiest attitude says yes and before I can even decide if I want to take it, his RUDE self really was putting it away. Of course I wasn't going to take that mediocre, thin slice of pizza from a place like this! Oh and FYI he let me touch the crust and proceeded to put it back to sell to someone else. I can't even begin to think of what the kitchen is like and how disgusting it is! I am in utter shock this place has a 4 star rating! DO NOT GO HERE."

The pizza here is super thin with a tangy tomato sauce and a nice char on the bottom from the coal oven. I took my food to go each time. The service at the takeout window was good. I waited about 10 minutes for a fresh pie. This is Manhattan, so parking can be a little difficult to come by. I certainly will be back."

Wanted to see if it's true, that it's hard to find a bad empanada. The result? What I picked up that came with a small container of green hot sauce was quite fine, and I suppose if you're going to serve them anywhere near the #7 train you'd better be on your game because there are a lot of great choices there. I didn't find the inside to be particularly inviting and service was curt and made one feel like they'd imposed on the person that waited on me. Oh well. Still, not a bad choice for the area."

There was only one other customer sitting down eating so it wasn't like she was in a rush to attend other customers. Also, when I checked my food at home, my order was wrong. I got french fries instead of homefries. Horrible service!"

They even sell empanadas which were very tasty (yes, I ordered the cheese one). Not too greasy and very crisp.Situated on a corner of the block, they have a fairly large dining area considering it's a bakery. Can easily seat 20. But the menu is where it gets interesting. Their prices seem to be very reasonable and the place is home-y. They serve breakfast all day, talking eggs and bacon people! They even sell burgers and Spanish Rice dishes. I didn't get to try any hot food (except the empanada) as it was a Saturday afternoon around 3pm. Just stopped in for drinks and snack food. My family and I tried the croissant (very doughy not flaky which I didn't care for), the Oreo cupcake (yummy), pan Con Queso (cheesy bread which was great), and bought a Napoleon (to go, was for someone else). A lot of the cakes on display looked great but I didn't shop for that. There were lots to choose from and I'm eyeing the flan on my next visit.The tables were clean and the staff were friendly.

It's cheap ($1.75 I think) for a nice-sized cup and it's delicious and actually ice brewed unlike some places. The baked goods look fresh and I'm pretty sure they do all the baking on the premises. The only baked good I've had is a ""Milky Bun"" think which was interesting and their Colombian cake which is amazingly moist, delicious, not too sweet and really authentic as far as my childhood experiences so...tastes just like the homemade Colombian cake served by practically everyone at the Colombian Independence Festival that takes place annually in Corona Park.Not a bad place overall, could have the potential for so much more though..."

Chicken pot pie surprisingly huge, good for two.  Fat reuben sandwich was on the small side and fries would have tasted better if we were to eat there.  The sandwich was standard but size was disappointing. Portions of the sandwich may be an issue due to lack of supply since it's a popular dish.  If people order for delivery stick with hot meals such as the pot pies, I would also try the wings."

Ok so, the wings were the worst thing (check the pic). They tasted old, as if they were taken from someone elses plate and recooked. And wtf these were supposed to be BUFFALO wings. They were sweet. Ugh. The philly cheesteak was mediocre. Wouldve been way better if they gave you bigger portion of meat. It was 80%bread. A decent piece of bread however. Fries were standard operation. Solid. My wife said her BLT was bland and the bread selection didnt work. All and all yeah im not ordering from here again. I probably shouldnt have to begin with lol."

Everyone working here was super friendly and it really gave off a welcoming energy. The interior is well done and nice enough for a date, but casual enough if you're looking to just grab dinner by yourself. I started with an order of the calamari which came out fast, hot and crispy. Super traditional presentation done right with a side of tomato sauce and a lemon wedge. For my main, I ordered the Chicken Francese which is always one of my favorites. It came with two nice-sized portions of chicken and a side of spaghetti. The chicken was tender and the lemon sauce was really solid. I do wish the spaghetti came in the same lemon sauce instead of tomato sauce though. I would probably ask for that next time as tomato vs. lemon sauce don't work side by side for me. Overall a nice spot that seems to care about the food they're putting out. Great find in this awesome little neighborhood."

I also tried the fettucine alfredo, which was creamy and delicious. The sauce stuck really nicely, coating the pasta, instead of it just sitting in liquid like a lot of other alfredo's i've ordered for delivery.

(The other one I already tried, 5ive spice tacos and banh mi)When I walked in, nobody asked me for a vaccine card and sat me down quickly. I don't know if it's because covid is not as prominent now or what- do what you will with that information. I looked at the menu and realized all the prices are Manhattan priced pretty much- a whopping 14 dollars for banh mi compared to 10 dollars at 5ive spice and 4-6 dollars in lower Brooklyn authentic Viet spots where I'm from. The pho was only 2 more dollars. One thing about this place that's different is that it offers more vegetarian options for a lot of people who can't eat meat which shows the locals of this neighborhood. I was pretty happy with my banh mi- the pate was not as moist/wet as the traditional banh mi I usually have which I actually prefer and the baguette they use is fresh and i was impressed by how my whole mouth hasn't gotten destroyed by this bread as usually when I eat banh mi my mouth is scraped so hard with the baguette texture. I could tell the meat was high quality and they used a good enough amount of vegetables where the sandwich isn't overflowed with carrots or other extra flavors which I really appreciated. Is it an expensive banh mi? YesIs it a perfectly made banh mi? YesAll in all, I got my quick banh mi fix and would be open to trying the other dishes at this restaurant when I'm back in the area!"

The Chicken in Coconut Lemongrass Curry Broth with potatoes, fresh mushrooms, onions, served with vermicelli was also a winner. It was hearty and had a lot of interesting flavors that melded together very well. The baby bok choy was a perfect compliment sauteed and served with hoisin sauce, not too oily."

926,vb-8neuGi8GPDTTnT2WO7g,3/31/2021,5 star rating,"Mekong BK serves delicious and fresh Vietnamese food on the Fort Greene/Clinton Hill border. They have some outdoor seating for COVID times but also will do pick up and delivery takeout orders. The indoor dining space is a few steps down from the street and is not stroller or wheel chair friendly, so I hope they keep the outdoor seating post pandemic.  The dining room is long and cozy and way back when had a tropical fish tank that was fun to watch. The food is stellar. I've had the spring rolls, the summer rolls, the salt and pepper calamari, the beef pho and the chicken pho, the pork chop, the banh mi. Everything is so. good. The flavors have the bright crisp greens, the tart lime, the warm toasted peanuts, the spicy jalapeno or sauces, the tang of fish sauce or smoky hoisin, the flaky fried batter, the long springy noodles, the crunchy bread. Everything I've had here is amazing.Staff are friendly, service is fast and friendly, prices are fair. Takeout orders are packed well to avoid soggy noodles, delivery was on time. I wish I could visit more often!"

928,oFRX5R0Bn_1rIeiPEP1VSw,1/17/2023,4 star rating,"An upscale dive bar with literally a diving theme. I've been to this spot like 3x and it's always a good time. $35 hookah which is surprisingly good considering they use insta light (cheap coal). Drinks are good, waitresses and bartenders are friendly. Menu is typical bar food, wings, quesadillas, & tacos are all good. My only complaint is they charge an automatic 18%, don't show you the receipt and then you end up adding tip."

The tv's might have been very loud for some people but they were okay for me. The hostesses were all really pleasant and the service was timely. My friends and I didn't eat much, we just shared Garlic Parmesan Wings and they were delicious. The drinks were strong and once the game was over a live DJ came on set. Had a great time! They do have two floors and the action is really downstairs so keep that in mind when requesting a table."

Walked in Sunday at 7 pm (ID and bag checked at the door) to a DJ spinning and a packed bar. We sat upstairs which had additional dining seating. Food was great and had a good mix of bar bites and meals. Service was a little slow, but probably because the waitresses were downstairs and upstairs throughout the night, wish they had someone upstairs just to monitor the tables for refills of water, etc. Dj was extremely loud as well. Couldn't really hear my table speak. Overall, nice spot with good food and music to sit and sip!"

I haven't been here for dinner or brunch but I have tried their empanadas which are very flaky and tasty. Their bbq wings are also very good with the perfect amount of kick to it. They have a huge variety of frozen drinks which are all so good. I usually order their mojitos which are always made perfectly and are decently priced. What I love the most about this place is the ambiance. Their first floor is not that big but I always manage to find a spot at the bar. All the bartenders are always super attentive and friendly. Even security at the door is welcoming. There is usually a DJ so the music is always good.

To start, we had the baba ghanouj and grilled halloume. The eggplant was creamy and light. It was served with warm mini pita breads and tasted very fresh. The halloume was smoky and flavorful. It came with three pieces of cheese which was a bit of a small portion size so my only complaint was wanting more! For my main, I had the falafel sandwich with fries. The dish was quite large and definitely enough for leftovers. The sandwich itself was a bit dry. When we asked for sauces, they provided both a garlic and tomato sauce. The garlic was whipped and fluffy with a hint of spice. It complemented the sandwich well. The tomato sauce didn't have too much flavor, but did improve the texture of the sandwich. The fries were extra skinny shoestring style. They could've been a tiny bit crispier, but were pretty tasty. One of my friends got the fatet shrimp and loved it, but the shish tawook and meat shawarma were dry. Overall, I'd definitely recommend a visit."

You can pick up a pub style lunch whether it be a cheeseburger or a corned beef sandwich. Then there are the old style drinks - maybe on the rocks or maybe neat.  The atmosphere is fun and the decor likely has not changed much since the 1930s and the patrons appreciate this.

When a project blew up, my friend asked if we could do something casual rather than Restaurant Week fine dining. And he's in Brooklyn so this is sorta halfway for us. I have been here twice before, just didn't know the name. I loved our server, who made me a FANTASTIC Manhattan. It was really slow on  Monday night and she joked that it made her irrationally happy to make a drink, rather than bring someone a diet Coke. On my new cleaner eating regimen, there's almost nothing for me to eat here except the chili. It was really good: not too many beans and incredibly spicy. No need for hot sauce when they've infused it with whatever to give it that mouth-on-fire- feel. Chopped onions and cheese on top. My friend, a New Yorker three decades, thinks Old Town has one of the best burgers in town. If you have no eating restrictions, I'm sure that tuna melt is terrific. The Caesar apparently good too."

I almost ordered their legendary cheeseburger and will need to come back to check that out. Even the men's room has sturdy vintage urinals ( like McSorleys for those who know).

I would honestly bring a date here. And the presentation for the food was impeccable. Also very fair prices. I am very pleased.

989,etIbdlTKz2yLkvr9MWNPvw,7/23/2022,3 star rating,"The sushi looks delicious and fresh and the prices are unbeatable, but the rice was kinda hard and the soy sauce they give you wasn't sushi soy sauce. In fact, it was like cheap dark Chinese soy sauce. It had a bit of a bitter aftertaste and wasn't umami salty at all. It made my sushi experience kinda meh. I'm hoping the hard, stale rice was a one time thing. The dressing on the salad that came with it was kinda diluted too. I'm not sure if I'll order from them again. Maybe if I have a craving for sushi and I have temporary amnesia, I will order from them again."
990,etIbdlTKz2yLkvr9MWNPvw,11/26/2022,4 star rating,I would say the sushi is pretty good and affordable. This however seems more like a to go place. When I went to dine in there were ALOT of to go orders wrapped and ready to go. The service was still pretty good but all our food came out pretty slow and I think it's cause the chefs were busy making the to go orders. The ambiance is nice but just with all the shuffling of to go orders I wouldn't realllly come here again for dine in.
991,etIbdlTKz2yLkvr9MWNPvw,7/26/2022,3 star rating,"I order from this place often but I'm going to do so much less now. Not really worth it when you really look at the product. If I order a specialty roll/sushi etc I expect there to be fish. Food might taste good but it's not worth the price if it's almost all filler, there's even rice packed inside the seaweed of the rolls now. Huge quality drop from when I started ordering years ago. Can't be more than 2oz of salmon the whole roll. Same maybe worse months later, even worst now 7/25"
992,etIbdlTKz2yLkvr9MWNPvw,2/17/2023,1 star rating,I never leave reviews but this place just gave me the Worst food poisoning of my life. They obviously cut corners here and it's not worth risking food poisoning under any circumstances.
993,etIbdlTKz2yLkvr9MWNPvw,2/14/2022,5 star rating,"This is hands down one of my favorite sushi restaurants ever. Their rolls are always super fresh and the prices are great! This spot is always bustling and is a local favorite. There is great variety in terms of the rolls available and the menu itself is expansive, and includes dishes other than sushi. If you're in the area, I highly recommend popping in for a bite."
994,etIbdlTKz2yLkvr9MWNPvw,12/25/2021,4 star rating,So far every order I placed on Uber Eats with them has been great! Food is reasonable priced and yummy as well. Was able have time to write a review for them finally. Presentation was better this time because of the size of the order for the Sashimi pieces.

995,etIbdlTKz2yLkvr9MWNPvw,6/26/2022,1 star rating,Went there today after a while and found place been renovated ! Look nice ! But we are very disappointed with the food as we always order chicken katsu and tempura shrimp but how come it taste so different as like chicken katsu been fried more than once and feel the fried in bad oil and same with shrimps tempura not crunchy at all like we got before in past 6 years ! Today like mostly feel like they put 10Times rolling  in flour and breadcrumb !No taste just bland and not same like before and been inform is not the same chef. Wont come back again unless they bring back the the former chef!!!
996,etIbdlTKz2yLkvr9MWNPvw,12/19/2021,3 star rating,"This is my family's usual choice of take out! We love to go for the chicken Pad Thai, and of course, their sushi! That being said, I would like to bring attention to something we had noticed with our sushi tonight and that I wish packing would be more mindful of. Both my Mom and my sister placed two sushi orders, one being vegetarian and the other being seafood. These were suppose to be separate orders, but they were placed in one carton. One of them has a slight seafood allergy that can sometimes act up depending on what exactly the content is. For people that have more of a severe reaction to it, I don't think it's wise to combine the orders into one carton. I understand trying to preserve space and not waste the plastic (which we do recycle), but as a overall safety precaution, I think you should cut your loses on this! Otherwise, the food is fantastic! You can't beat the price for it! But giving 3 stars for quality control. As someone whom has worked briefly in the food industry, cross contamination is no joke. Please be more aware!"

Great and attentive service. We were taught how much time to cook each item, which we appreciated. Actually used our timer. Beef tongue is an additional $6. Thin slices, I preferred cooked til a bit browned. For me, still gamey flavor but dipping it in a mixture of their sauces helped (sweet soy, ponzu and spicy). The other meats were flavorful already so no sauce needed. Toro beef is fatty. Good but some pieces were chewy. Made sure we cooked the ribeye  as told bec was dry when we overcooked.  Yaki-pork was sweet and can char easily. It was also happy hour already so could have gotten drinks and other items at HH price but what we ordered was enough. We had less meat than at AYCE korean bbq, but we were full.Casual place. Multiple booths for seating. Get the app for rewards."

And it's like one in YouTube ""bottakuri"" .Taste is much lower than ones we can cook at home and I didn't expect these quality in such famous chain restaurant from japan !! So shame !

999,bB8dHfAEJrF5tNcHr0yJjA,2/10/2023,5 star rating,"My friend and I recently came to take advantage of the AYCE deal. We chose the premium tier for $52 (automatic 18% gratuity is added). Some highlights include: seaweed soup, shio negi cold tofu, yaki-shabu beef, bistro hanger steak, spicy shrimp, and garlic mushroom. As you can see, the food was so good I didn't even photograph half of our plates. We topped off the evening with some s'mores. Service was top-notch - probably some of the best I seen. Someone was by maybe every 10 or so minutes to make sure we could order food, and made sure our stoves were at the appropriate level. Food was dropped off very quickly and they reminded you off how long to cook each piece (there's also a nice guide on the table too). Overall, I loved my experience here and can't wait to come back!"
1000,bB8dHfAEJrF5tNcHr0yJjA,1/24/2023,2 star rating,Was a regular here but after my last visit i dont know so much. Service was pretty slow. Every other table got much more attention than ours even though we ordered so much food. Noone came to check how was everything other than at the end the busser was taking our plates away and asked how was everything. Not even our waiter. The food was good but when you look around the place is filthy. Everything is covered in dust. And this is why i dont be coming back bc they simply cannot clean the place. They were also taking garbage through the dining area. Just no consideration for the diners. I checked in my $1000 coat with a hanger and a number on it so it wouldnt smell from the meat and I come back to the front with none of our belongings attended and my jacket off the hanger just sitting on a chair. Its the simple things. Wont be coming back.
1001,bB8dHfAEJrF5tNcHr0yJjA,1/22/2023,3 star rating,"Food was good, had a bunch of meats for bbq and also tried the beef sushi. No complaints with the meal and it was actually better than what I expected!However, I ordered a carafe of the house sake and specified that I wanted it cold - it literally said on the menu ""enjoy it hold or cold"" or something like that. It came out hot. I told our server I wanted it cold and she said that's not an option. Hm. I pointed it out on the menu but she just shrugged and left. Not really a huge fan of hot sake but I decided to just keep it and order something else. When she passed by again, I ordered a different sake on the menu and pointed it out with my finger (a regular junmai). Then they brought out a bottle of the yuzu sake and opened it before I was able to say that it wasn't what I ordered. At that point, it was whatever, I just kept it. Please make sure the servers know what drinks you have on the menu."
1002,bB8dHfAEJrF5tNcHr0yJjA,1/10/2023,5 star rating,"This location of Guy-Kaku Japanese BBQ has been around for 10+ years, and it survived a fire!  We love stopping by here to celebrate birthdays (they give you a free cake and staff sing you a happy birthday!), graduations and just a old regular summer.Similar to Korean BBQ, you can order a selection of meats, and combos with veggies, kids meals, vegetarian meals, or simply just some rice/ramen. I also think that their dessert is to die for.  There are lava cakes, matcha Icecream, and layered cake.  It will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth. The restaurant is huge, and they have comfortable seating.  The ambiance is a bit dark but I like how spacious it feels, and cozy it feels when you sit down to eat with friends/family."
1003,bB8dHfAEJrF5tNcHr0yJjA,1/27/2023,4 star rating,I've always been a fan of gyukaku but their portions are getting smaller (specifically the salad) and the servers are less and less attentive. I felt like I was sucha bother the whole time. The food was good at least. They are running an AYCE special now Monday thru Thursday so I do think it's worth a try!
1004,bB8dHfAEJrF5tNcHr0yJjA,9/10/2022,2 star rating,I've been coming here for so many years! Its weirdly been changing in little ways and not for the better. They don't oil the grills anymore and I really like the yakishabu which is a very thin cut of meat and it gets so stuck! They also don't give the s'mores supposedly when they have the little activity sheets for kids. It says it on the sheet but then the waiter says you had to have gotten the the kids combo meal. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ The garlic noodles. They've changed the plating and it's also pretty soggy and not as flavorful.:( I wish there was something new that's comparable.
1005,bB8dHfAEJrF5tNcHr0yJjA,12/8/2022,5 star rating,"Came here in a group of 4 to catch up over Japanese bbq on a Saturday evening. We made a reservation for 6pm but they do not seat until all guests are here - which makes sense given the unlimited bbq with time restraints. We actually decided to get a group set and it was a great amount of food for the 4 of us. The service was fast and the food was delicious. Our cocktails were also really good - huge fan of the mojito! Although there was a slight miscommunication between us and the server on what we ordered versus what we saw on our bill, she was understanding g and accommodating and addressed the issue."
1006,bB8dHfAEJrF5tNcHr0yJjA,12/5/2022,4 star rating,"Definitely come here for happy hour! It's so worth it with the happy hour. I ordered a different variety of meats and they all come with the perfect amount, perfect for a small group. Service was a bit slow on an afternoon, but staff was friendly and was able to help as soon as they can. Highly recommend getting the corn!"

1008,Z5FKUxsLDi5LznSrmH-ISg,1/22/2023,1 star rating,"By far the worst service I've ever experienced AND biggest rip off in terms of ""bottomless"" brunch. First off, the mimosas were basically orange juice without a drop of alcohol. We chose the bottomless add on and the service was so poor that we got a total of TWO glasses the entire meal. Since when did bottomless mean 2 glasses? We even had our empty cups at the edge of the table to show we were done but barely anyone came by the entire time we were there Lastly, they tack on a 20% gratuity charge if you spend over $100 or have 5+ people, even if the server only comes by your table once and gives you a whopping 2 drinks for bottomless. We were so disappointed by this place, there are much better bottomless brunch options"
1009,Z5FKUxsLDi5LznSrmH-ISg,9/29/2022,3 star rating,"Walked in, looked at the menu, ordered coffee and immediately left. Received rude service along the way. I would say come here if you're looking to do a big group and bottomless mimosas and you're trying to make the bill easy - so that everyone owes the same. There's a prefix menu where everything is $22 - which is just ridiculous to me given the options they have. A meatless salad and steak and eggs to be the same cost is just not for me. The only things even close to being worth that much are the steak and eggs and the chicken and waffles. Who is paying $22 for a meatless salad? So we went next door and ordered a $14 salad which is what I was looking for. We wanted to order some iced coffee/lattes, but it's not on the menu and they only had heavy cream. So we tried to make our own iced coffee, given the heavy cream and sugar cubes - it didn't work at all. So, we ordered our coffees, paid the bill and left, this was not it."

It was hard to see in and the door was so hard to open we initially thought it was closed lol. Wasn't closed but door was a workout just to enter. We were able to choose our seating near the windows overlooking their super cute outdoor area. Had I seen that off rip I would've requested to sit there, was really chic and cute. Our server was a young man, teenager looking like he was forced to come in by his mom (I know the look lmao)....he cracked a smile when I referenced his demeanor, he was cool! The food. Listen. My friend and I were not prepared for two things; the amazing bottomless mimosas and the delicious food we were blessed with. The entire kitchen staff deserves praise, the food was amazing!!!!!! 100% recommend this spot."
1011,Z5FKUxsLDi5LznSrmH-ISg,1/15/2023,2 star rating,"I'd only come back for the food. And I'd make sure to sit at the bar and not pay for unlimited mimosas. The service was horrible. We never got checked on. We got 3 refills of our ""unlimited mimosas"". We sat for 20 minutes before getting our order taken. It took another 20 minutes to get our check. The place seems understaffed for a Sunday brunch day. However, that food was AMAZING. Still not worth the hour wait to receive. So you decided food or service?"
1012,Z5FKUxsLDi5LznSrmH-ISg,5/2/2022,4 star rating,"I stopped by Piquant very shortly after running NYCRuns Brooklyn Half Marathon. While I did not intend on dining here, I'm very glad that I did. I pretty much stopped by because it was one of the few brunch spots that was not packed with half marathoners. Overall, I had a pretty pleasant experience at Piquant. For my dining pleasure, I went with the Route 66, which was two poached eggs on a biscuit and covered with sausage gravy. While the dish was yummy, I thought it was a bit too ""soupy"" because of the gravy and hollandaise sauce. The dish also came with a small fruit and house salad. I will say that this dish really did satisfy my hunger after running 13.1 miles and walking an additional 2 miles from Prospect Park to the restaurant. While I was not interested in doing the $20/hr bottomless brunch, I decided to go for it since a single glass of sangria was $11. Then again, one does not really need to twist my arm for unlimited adult beverages. . . even when I'm dining alone. Hey, don't they say more bounce to the ounce? Since I was sitting at the bar (and was the only one there), my service was pretty prompt.Tip if you are dining upstairs: The restaurant has additional restrooms downstairs."
1013,Z5FKUxsLDi5LznSrmH-ISg,1/15/2023,2 star rating,Wouldn't recommend this place for bottomless brunch. Bottomless essentially amounts to two drinks. Service is abhorrent and they include tip automatically so no consequences for poor service. Food is pretty good but there much better spots with equally good food and much better service.

Their steak and eggs are my favorite but I've tried almost everything on their menu and I can never get enough.

If you love sangrias and mimosas this is the place for it, they make the best drinks!"

The manager chose not to personally apologize/address this severe health code violation3. The bill reflected no charge for the moldy meal, but no attempt of making right the grave wrong of serving a paying customer, who left their home to eat at Piquant and be served food that most would not feed their dogs. I was appalled, disgusted, and offended by the incident and even more by the management's response.  So on top of risking COVID, customers have to risk food poisoning too? That's what we are doing in 2021?I will never go to piquant and I hope they are dealt with accordingly. They clearly do not have the capacity to remain open and is a risk to public safety.  No aesthetic is worth the experience I had. I am disgusted even writing this review. Stay clear of Piquant."

I remember when this McDonald's really sucked. It always took forever, lots of attitude--just like everyone else said. Even the fries were bad. And what's McDonald's without good fries, really.Then they closed down for a few months and a week before they reopened, I walked by once and caught a glimpse of the artsy stencils they were putting up on the walls. I think one of them almost looked like Obama. I had to wonder why it was necessary for this McDonald's to take itself THAT seriously just for it to function. The stencils worked, because when this place opened up again it was COMPLETELY different. Everyone behind the counter is always respectful and nice, the service is reasonable even during crowded times and the food is as good as McDonald's gets. And yes, the first time I went I was totally charmed by the jazz they were playing--especially because it wasn't elevator smooth jazz. It was some straight up be-bop, high on psychadelics and heroin jazz. Note to 90% of NYC bars: be more like this McDonald's.I also love how many people were as taken with the jazz as I was. Look at us, we some yuppies for real!The last time I went, around 10am on a Saturday, two older Caribbean men waiting for their food in front of me started up a discussion about politics that quickly made an existential turn into a debate about faith. One of them was defiant in his belief in a divine greater power but not in any single religion. The other guy refused to accept this and stormed away with his Hot Cakes. Behind me, two old ladies sipped their coffee gossiping about a girl who just got pregnant. I got all the tea just standing there waiting for my Egg McMuffin! Trust me when I say this McDonald's is poppin. Thank you, stencils."

So yes, this was the place to be. 3 stars because I've been here before any the staff was on their game... also 3 stars because today... there was no game. It was a free-for-all. Tables with reserve signs on them, no list to put your name on & barely any table service although there seemed to be plenty of staff. There was no routine - you had to grab a staff member when they walked by because you could be sure they weren't stopping at your table. We were two people who wound up being at Greenwood Park for nearly 3 hours... and only had 2 rounds of drinks. Why only 2 rounds of drinks? Well that's because the crew was pure chaos. Most tables were experiencing the same. We would have easily had a 3rd round and possibly a 4th. It was truly an odd experience.Typically I'd recommend this place but I do have to say, go with the above in the back of your mind. Hopefully they're organized now & this was a one-off. The place has a lot of potential with an awesome outdoor space."

I don't really love beer and being around small, possibly screaming humans is not my idea of a good time. Alas, here we are. I came with a friend and her small, sometimes screaming human on an early Saturday afternoon. The beer garden, while expansive, wasn't crowded - it was still a little chilly out and they had opened maybe an hour or two earlier. We were lucky to be seated under the big tent. It got warmer and sunnier later in the day. 90s music [Blink-182, Lifehouse] was playing on the sound system [but not too loud!] and baseball was on the TV outside [no sound]. This is my kind of vibe. The staff were all masked and tables were separated fairly far apart. I had the Caesar Salad [$13.5] which was surprisingly REALLY good. I can't remember the last time I had a legitimate Caesar salad. Don't get this if you're not a fan of anchovies - they're lined up on the plate like, ""how you doin'?""I added chicken so it was $4 extra. This was a big delicious salad.   My friend and I also shared the Blue Fries [$9]. They were really good too. The fries were especially crispy and loaded up with blue cheese. The portion size was ample, so definitely good for sharing. I could probably do without the truffle oil - it's pretty played out and can be overwhelming. Lastly, I had a pretty excellent sour-y-ish beer (x2) that was fruity. I don't remember what it was called, but the waitress recommended it after the one I had originally wanted was sold out. Service was decent but sluggish at times. The small, sometimes screaming human started to scream toward the end of our outing. The staff was really understanding, so I appreciated that. We each paid $56 after tax and tip. I would actually love to come back."

Servers were friendly and accommodating. We were really looking forward to ordering the Honey Beer but the server said they couldn't serve alcohol because of restaurant's licensing issue.Food was okay. The wings were not as crispy as other Korean fried chicken places. Flavor was okay. Bacon cheese fries were soggy. Would probably not order again. Overall: I would only come back for the honey beer and maybe give the wings another chance.

There was a ton of people at this location in spite of the single digit degree temperature.   Maybe Valentine's celebrations?  Or maybe that is how good the food was!  I would definitely try it again."
1040,zcWxZaC7pnIVe2ON4uUEDw,2/12/2023,2 star rating,Ordered the boneless soy garlic chicken and the crispy fried chicken. Honestly both were disappointing... the soy garlic boneless chicken was kind of hard to chew and the crispy chicken with bones were small and didn't have much meat. Also the fried gizzard were disappointing as well... they were tasteless. And I took a couple bites of the scallion and something tasted funky. I looked it it again and the onion looked slimy...its def old

Korean style fried wings so they were crispy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside, covered in the sauce. Also ordered the hot wings as well, which were just as good.

I will say it's on the small side and the burger patty wasn't the most interesting, but the sauce and toppings made it flavorful. They make their own mushroom and bean based burgers, so you know that they are high-quality, protein-packed, and healthy. I can't say that about many other vegan burgers! I tried my mom's burger bun (also homemade) and it was good, but i was happy with my lettuce wrap. The large salad was a decent portion but not my favorite, which is understandable since I'm not much of an arugula fan. The grilled squash was very good, but I wish it came with more!

The space is warm and inviting, and the people who work there have been really friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients.The burgers, which are mushroom and bean-based, are delicious (not surprising since Lekka Burger comes from the chef behind Dirt Candy), and it's nice to have a veggie burger option that isn't just made with meat substitutes. I got the cheeseburger on a recent visit, and it was a mess in the best way possible. Slathered in ketchup, mustard, mayo, and cheese sauce, the flavors were all spot-on. I got an order of their crispy crinkle-cut fries on the side, and they were the perfect accompaniment.I love that Lekka Burger has their soft serve year-round and not only in the summer. They always have vanilla plus a rotating flavor, which was mango on my last visit. I got the vanilla-mango swirl, which was a nice treat while waiting for the rest of the food to be made.For anyone outside of the area or who can't make it to Lekka Burger in person, they also sell their burger kits on Goldbelly, so you can get all the same flavors from the comfort of home.

All of it was very good and it's great to have a fully vegan spot downtown. The inside was very cute and inviting. The staff was friendly and let us try the soft serve before deciding, which is always a great characteristic. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a satisfying plant-based lunch downtown!"

Very Comfy setting with A warm decor & Great food to match the vibe. I'll start off by saying they have one of the best Vegan Cheese's I've tasted (Very Hard to find Cheese Alternatives); So the Cheese Fries are a must. It reminds me of Cheese Fries from Shake Shack if not better! The Fried Mushrooms are also really good as well which you can consider a good duo with the fries. They also have a seasonal Broccolini Caesar Salad that's def worth getting whenever it's available. Milkshakes were good. Not the biggest fan of the Burger but to each it's own. Definitely one of the places added to my Rotation of Vegan restaurants in NYC. I'll be back soon!"

They have an assortment of different burgers, with the Masala Burger probably being my favorite. It's surprising that everything is vegan, including the condiments and also their desserts. I recommend getting the fries (incredibly crispy) and the shake (I got the halva flavor). They also have vegan chili, which is really hearty and perfect for winter.On top of the great food, I love the ambience and decor of the restaurant as well. The colors are cheery, as well as the staff. It's a good spot to solo dine or come with friends, and the food works great take-out as well."

Their 2 most popular burgers are the Masala burger and the guacamole burger. I got their guacamole burger on a lettuce cup rather than on a bun. The guacamole burger came with chili sauce, lime guacamole, radishes, jalapeño, cilantro, and tomato. The meat was delicious and fresh. I loved how they make their own vegan meat fresh in their kitchen rather than using pre-made vegan meat. I also got their za'atar sumac fries which was fresh, crispy, and tasted authentic with all the herbs.They also have kombucha, shakes, ice cream, coffee, matcha, sparking wines, red wine, rosé, cocktails, etc.Will definitely be back again for lunch when I'm back in the neighborhood.P.S.: they have a vintage arcade cabinet with pac-man game on the inner right corner of the restaurant."

Excellent use of limited space for dining and counter area. These factors aside, the wait for our two sandwiches/burger and Za'tar Sumac Fries was unexpectedly long. The sit-ins were not super plentiful but I did see many receipts in progress for presumably mobile orders. I don't mind waiting, especially on the account of only two chefs/working kitchen members, but it was nearly an hour and our order was wrong when it did come (there was a sandwich with no patty :0). Mistakes happen, I get it and upon realizing, the kitchen staff were eager to get on it. The buzzer that was supposed to ring was not making the noises as was claimed, thus leading to the predicament in the first place. When the Cook offered to compensate us, though, the cashier insisted we just wait and that dismissive attitude of the chef's intention to make amends with either another drink or something else for our patient wait did sour the mood though. Luckily, the saving grace was the caramel milkshake- honestly best shake I have had, plus it was vegan! Again, this might not be reflective of all experiences but this was my experience."

You go up and order at the counter. The burgers have different toppings but they all use the same white bean patty except a guacamole burger which uses black bean. We split the peri peri burger and a cookie. I liked the burger a lot although it had a very smoky taste. I'd try the black bean one next time.The cookie was just not good and I wouldn't recommend it. It tasted like a packaged protein cookie or microwave cookie. The server was very nice although he seemed to be new or confused, not a big deal. I can see myself coming back to try other items!"

Aren't they supposed to stir fry the noodles in some pad thai sauce or something? Maybe the cooks were high and forgot.

1067,jYjJNB9qlmd6dbYZBaDjfw,12/30/2022,4 star rating,Needed dessert after indulging in too much kbbq. Decided to check out Biao Sugar because Tiger Sugar down the street was closed. Felt like the crowd from Tiger Sugar migrated here. Came towards the end of the night so selection was more limited in this small bubble tea store. Ordered the Ube Brown Sugar Boba Milk. It was good but I didn't get a strong ube taste so it was like drinking a regular brown sugar milk tea. Pretty cool concept of drinks coming out of the tiger mouth. Do you dare to try?
1068,jYjJNB9qlmd6dbYZBaDjfw,12/8/2022,3 star rating,"It's dirty and rundown inside. They have a pretty big selection of different types of teas/tapiocas. The thing that sets this place apart is the 'egg' cups that they sell for a little bit of a upcharge. You can get your drink in a little dragon egg type thing if you want for a little over $7. The egg itself has a screw top. It's not really that water tight so be careful when you're shaking it. It's also kind of difficult since you have to hold the top, put the straw in and drink, then put the top back later. But then what do you do with the straw? It's very inconvenient on the go. If you're wanting to keep the egg as a souvenir I'm not sure what you'd do with it while wandering around. Just seems like a hassle - but a cute hassle. Service isn't that friendly and they sort of unceremoniously just hand you the drinks through the dragon's mouth. Minimally cool. Overall though, I don't think it's that much more expensive than the regular tapioca drink you can find here in the city. The taste was fine - not too sugary."

The drinks are decent and they are very generous with the bubble portions. From a flavor profile, the milk itself is a bit flatter than Gong Cha but your mileage may vary - the brown sugar flavor was not really there in this version. Overall it's a quick, easy to access option for boba close to Herald Square. They also run promos on Uber Eats at times as well."

You ordered from the left side and then grabbed your drink from the dragon's mouth. The customer service was friendly and very quick with our drinks. What I got was the Biao brown Sugar boba with foam milk or #1. My boyfriend got the passion fruit tea. I honestly loved what I ordered it wasn't super sweet like any other places I've been to. Most places I've been to either put too much brown sugar or their boba is too sweet. This place got it down nicely where I enjoyed my brown sugar boba drink a lot. My boyfriend tried my drink and fell in loved with it a lot. That same night he bugged me to get us the drinks again from Biao Sugar. So I used my Uber eat app to get it delivered to our hotel. The drink was still cold and tasted very delicious as how you would get it in person at the location. I definitely recommend this place if you are into brown sugar boba drink. I would definitely come back and order everyday from this place.

BIAO is just outside the main KTown block, and it's this little hole in the wall store, but it has a ton of character. I've actually been to Raccoon Cave, which is made by BIAO, and I have similar thoughts about the two places. I like that BIAO levels up the experience of getting boba by delivering it in through a lion's mouth, but it's a bit that I can see getting old quickly. Nevertheless, though, it's fun and fresh and different and my social anxiety GETS the want to deliver drinks that way. We ordered (rating): Ube Brown Sugar Boba Milk with Pudding (4/5), Grapefruit Green Tea (4/5)Honestly the brown sugar milk was pretty good. I remember going to Raccoon Cave and being underwhelmed because the ratio of milk to sugar was off, but this was much better. I did order the ube one, though, and I couldn't taste the ube very much. It all mixes to become the same color so you really forget you ordered ube in the first place. My friend is a huge fan of the grapefruit green tea, but it'd be nice if you could adjust the sweetness on the fruit teas because it's on the sweeter end. I found the boba to be on the smaller and stickier side. They were smaller than you'd expect them to be but bigger than what is typically called mini boba. And by ""stickier"" I mean that they tend to stick to your teeth and then it pulls away a little like gum. They were also slightly softer than I'd like, so that in combination with the stickiness was a little rough texture-wise, BUT they were brown-sugar coated so the taste was absolutely there."

If you like boba, then you'd probably like this place, I'm just personally not that crazy about it. It's a small store, but everything comes out very fast, so you don't really have to wait around.

The carrot cake itself is dense while the frost is a mixture of cream cheese + classic white sugar frosting. It is a small store so as long as there aren't too many people waiting or making a custom order, you'll be in and out. If I were in the area and craving something sweet, I would come again."

1082,DI5A-3PzqAHqh5ynp8yebw,1/27/2023,5 star rating,"I'm giving 5 stars based on the carrot cake.  If Yelp allowed 1/2 stars, I'd take one off for the ambiance.  The carrot cake -- I had a slice of the version with raisins and nuts -- was delicious. As other Yelpers have noted, it is a one layer cake, not two layers with frosting in the middle.  It's just about as tall as a regular layer cake would be, though, which is to say one really really deep layer.  VERY moist and delicious.Some Yelpers noted that the cream cheese frosting was very sweet.  That's true, but it is generously applied on the top and if one snagged a bit of that top frosting with each bite of cake, I think it would be a perfect complement to the cake.  Somehow, I ate the slice from the bottom up, which left with with a lot of frosting at the end and very little cake, which was not an ideal eating algorithm.  The Lexington Avenue store itself is a hole in the wall and not particularly bright or cheery, but the carrot cake is worth it."

1084,DI5A-3PzqAHqh5ynp8yebw,8/16/2021,4 star rating,"The cake was heavenly for how moist and fresh it tasted. Love how it isn't layered with the cream cheese frosting which helps maintain the cake's own integrity. The Cream Cheese on top however was sweeter than my preference but it helps to not have it immersed in the cake so you can taper how much you get in each mouthful. I wish they sold a loaf-size version of the cake on its own as I would definitely rush to buy it. The cake was near perfect but only because my I like  the carrots in the cake to have a different texture than the rest of the cake, and because the frosting was sweeter than I like, this place gets a 4 for me. If you don't care for these two nitpicks specifically, then Lloyd's Carrot Cake would be a 5/5 for sure.Would I get it again? Absolutely!"

But if you're not close by, I'm not sure if this cake is ""unique"" enough for you to make a trip up north just to try it. I like how the carrot cake is not too sweet itself - it's the icing on top that makes it sweet. This way if you prefer your cake not sweet, just avoid the icing. I like texture in my carrot cake. This carrot cake is blended pretty well so you don't really taste the individual ingredients except if you get the raisin and nuts one."
1086,DI5A-3PzqAHqh5ynp8yebw,6/13/2021,5 star rating,"Famous carrot cake that is without question the best carrot cake I've ever had.  Once you've had carrot cake from Lloyds, no other carrot cake will compare. You can also buy a piece by the slice, and they deliver - using ubereats, postmates and nationwide using Goldbelly (frozen and wrapped securely for delivery).  Located in the area on Lexington Avenue with 12 fabulous finds within a couple blocks.  A friend from out of town originally told me when we passed this little storefront that Lloyds was famously known for its carrot cakes (then bought one to take back to the suburbs for family).  Since then, I have brought a few cakes to parties and events, including one this weekend , and everyone always enjoys the amazing cake-- so moist with heavenly sweet cream cheese frosting. Definitely recommend!"

I maybe would have one or two drinks here. I would have a slight buzz.  But if you're anything like my friends you would go for more.  Depending on who your bartender was you'd get buybacks. The staff is always so nice. I think I had to pay at the door once because it was a dance night. ::BathRoom Alert::Don't get drunk there's stairs. You know how stairs and drunk people don't mix. I was sober and almost fell down them. I couldn't imagine if I was drunk. They lose a star because of the food. Not sure if they still serve it. But I remember I got sick once. But it could just be my stomach. I love that the train is right down the block. Thats definitely a huge plus for us low incomers that take mta when tipsy and hope not to pee ourselves waiting for a train.

Our intent was the neighboring bar, The Grayson; however, they were at the 25% max capacity, so we came here.This bar was almost empty at the time of arrival and the vibe was noticeably different from The Grayson. The menu was very limited, as the waitress said they ran out of food from the night before (there was a boxing match) we found this very odd--but whatever. The service was okay and our server was friendly.The numbers picked up later on, actually I believe they had too many people inside as a relatively large group came. It seemed they were asking a few people to move so they could accommodate the large group. I know times are rough for restaurants, but I wasn't sure how I felt about this practice. After the first we game, we opted to leave. The vibe of the bar wasn't bad, but I prefer the atmosphere at The Grayson, along with the fact that my sole food option was french fries and/or mozzarella sticks."

I guess it's just never come up. Came a few days ago and they have fairly cheap drinks. All day happy hour (which just means there's no happy hour but the drinks are just priced relatively affordable): $6 for beer on draft and wells, $4 shots, and I believe $7 wine. Eh. These days with covid and inflation I guess it's okay. They blast music super loud to try and get more people to come in. We sat outside at a picnic table. I think there's a downstairs area for dancing. Though I never saw that feature. I did see the unisex bathroom situation in the basement and it's kind of gross. The main room mostly was dedicated to a few stragglers watching sports. I think they serve food? Bar food like chicken wings and burgers from what I could tell. If I didn't feel like crud I probably would have enjoyed the mango beer I ordered more but I felt like crud. Also the pints feel somehow smaller than a traditional pint or maybe that's just me. There's nothing special about it. I guess if you want to watch sports, listen to music, dance for cheap/free this is a spot. Gets way more crowded on weekends."

I came in last Saturday with a few of my girl friends and all was well until the very end of the night when a male busser in a CK shirt GRABBED me and pulled me out of the way to get to a table in the upstairs area which would have caused me to fall if my girl friend had not caught me. I would like to clarify that I couldn't hear him if he was asking me to move because I was on the phone for 10 seconds (Yes, I did check my call log :)) with an Uber driver. There was no reason to pull me even if I couldn't hear him because 1)  you as a staff member should NEVER touch a customer and 2) if he really needed to get to the table so badly he could have either gone around to the other side or politely asked one of my girlfriends who would have escorted me out of the way. When one of my girl friends pulled him off and asked him not to touch me, he yelled back ""I WORK HERE!""...very professional...Completely rude and unbelievable. Glad I didn't end up drinking that night so I could fully remember all the details of this awful encounter. Never coming here again.

Upon going there tonight, the bouncer took my friend's ID and mine and claimed them as fake. To check them, all he did was shine a flashlight on them and refused to give them back to us. We asked him to scan it to prove that they were real, but he refused to give them back to us DESPITE THE FACT THAT SCANNING IDS IS LITERALLY IN A BOUNCER'S JOB DESCRIPTION. Only after threatening to call the police so that he would return our IDs did he give them back (very rudely). We will never be going back. I advise further training for your bouncers on out of state IDs because this experience was ridiculous. Or just scan them - like you're supposed to fucking do."

All the veggies and the falafel were super fresh and came with two small containers of tzeziki sauce and pickles/olives. The food was served up quickly. The environment is clean and hip. There are large tables, all essentially high tops. The decor is industrial and is dark. Table tops were made of epoxy and chickpeas, which I found super quirky. The music is not that loud, and the overall feel of the restaurant facilities great conversations with the team. We did order some of the prepackaged baklava, which was ok but not the best ever. I would skip those if you're a baklava snob. Most importantly, the food is reasonably priced for a quick and healthy lunch. It definitely beats out some of the other Mediterranean places I have been to in the area."

BUT I recently tried the sabich sandwich with eggplant and egg and I liked it a LOT more. The eggplant was soft and moist, and veggies completed the egg and hummus nicely. Also loved it with the green sauce. For $12, not a bad ""healthy"" lunch option in the area, especially when salads cost so much these days.They also have seating so it's a good place to dine in and catch up with a friend!"

It's definitely the best I've ever had, I could eat it with a spoon. The classic falafel sandwich is a great option for lunch - filling and flavorful. I got the falafel platter which was alright but I wasn't that crazy about the other falafel flavors.I would love if the restaurant had more options to customize the platters on the menu - OR at least had a falafel platter option that does not include all 3 flavors and just one flavor.Finally, my biggest and only real complaint is that the halloumi offered is not real halloumi. I got the halloumi salad and was severely disappointed, as the halloumi is more like a paneer cheese than it is halloumi. If they could swap this for some real salty, briny halloumi, I would be so happy."

This place has darts in the back area so that was a cute vibe. Not sure I would come here again. This is New York so I'm expecting the best of the best.

No menu per say; just order from what you see on draft for beer and shout out your standard drink order whether that be a house mixed drink or straight shot. Bartenders are ever attentive too. It does seem to function doubly as a sports bar, but was easy-going during our visit. As it is located near Madison Square Garden, I am sure it gets popping after all events let out there. What more do you need than cheap cold drinks and a chill atmosphere? A quintessential neighbor bar in NYC that checks all the right boxes is what you are on the look out for."

I've always wanted to move to the east coast, but never really cared to look into it. Let's just say we met so many people at this bar, from the owners, bartenders to the customers were all amazing.

It was at precisely the same moment that someone ordered two slices of that same pizza ahead of us and also two pepperoni. My eyes flew to the pepperoni and that's what we got. One grandma slice and one pepperoni with 2 sodas. I paid $12.50. But before I did I noticed the cute decor on the walls idk what the official word for a pizza paddle is called but they had a lot of them all arranged in a cute sort of deconstructed puzzle and the dinning area was spacious and clean. The two young men were attentive assisting multiple ppl but there was one other guy with his shirt covered in flour he was nice his attitude was great and yeah I would definitely recommend for a simple pepperoni slice of pizza and definitely return.

It's one thing to charge a processing or service charge for credit/debit card purchases but to charge a processing fee for cash is nothing less than THEFT. I also think they did this because my son is a young teen and wouldn't question the charge. I noticed it when he came home with the receipt.I can't recommend this restaurant anymore, the pizza & wings are flavorless and horrible now. This place has severely declined in the last few years with the food and service. Go anywhere else other than this hole in a hall dive"

The Neapolitan ( round) was like a wet paper towel that someone spilt sauce and cheese on. Floppy mess! ( couldn't even get it out of the box)Sicilian pie way over cooked and a very acidic sauce that tasted like it was from a can of dollar store pizza sauce. New owners better step up the game an get serious about what they are selling. The ball was officially dropped!"

The default is the location in Brooklyn. On a Thurs I thought I ordered pick-up in Rockaway where I live. When I arrived at 10 o'clock the Rockaway location was locked up and closed. I could only call Slice - not the restaurant directly. They told me the only option was to go to Brooklyn and get the $30 pizza. No delivery was possible, no credit nothing. I ended up paying $30 for a pizza I never received, wow. I called again the next day and there was no opportunity to talk to anybody at Elegante again. Too bad. They have great pizza, calzone, sandwiches and calamari. Forget it."

The pizza here is good however their service makes the experience eating here unpleasant. The delivery personnel are also horrible. They need to change their staff."

Decent prices, quick delivery, nothing too over the top. Crust was crisp, cheese to dough ratio good, not overly salty or oily. Sauce not too acidic or sweet."

But, I feel more than hungry. I feel nauseous and disoriented.I came here on thursday to get what I thought was a fresh pepperoni pizza, tiramisu, and beef patty. The pepperoni pizza was disappointing, the cheese was so old it was stiff as my rheumatoid arthritis. It wasn't even yellow, I see the school buses ride by and then I look at my pizza and It must have chlamydia. It's overly greasy as well, I don't need to see the movie ""grease"" to know what the plot is, it's on my plate. The pepperoni on the pizza was just horrendous, it wasn't just anemic, it had liver spots which makes sense because the crust had crows feet and was overcooked. The beef patty is deadly, I mean I thought it tasted great at first but, it must've been laced with miralax  or C-lax because I was shooting beef bullets from all ends. The only good thing about this place is the tiramisu but, I only had it once so maybe I received a batch made from 1% milk but the portion size is terrible.I should've known not to ever eat from this place again after my experience with the spaghetti with sausage and eggplant parmesan hero  last month.  The spaghetti with sausage was just heartburn, heartburn, and heartburn. The sauce was acidic and tasted like tomato paste and ginger ale. The spaghetti wasn't even fully cooked and looked like fallopian tubes. The sausage was so chewy that I was chewing one piece for the whole day. I didn't know that spaghetti and sausage came with it's own gum. The eggplant parmesan looked like a vagina with gangrene. I mean, the eggplant reminded me of jeepers creepers because it was horrible. It tasted like an old fisherman's boot and the parm was like condensed mayo. Even when the guy delivered the food,  he looked like he was dazed out of his mind. But, even before he arrived because he spun around the block looking for my house about 12 times and when I got the food it was lukewarm. I ordered it at 1:40pm and received my food at 3:40pm.I've never experienced such, I've even tried to call them about my food and spoke to this rude lady who refused to compensate me. I need to be compensated for the amount of time I spent in the bathroom and for any clogged arteries I may have obtained from eating food from an anatomy book. I mean, who made these recipes? They need to be fired and sent to rehabilitation center for their obsessive use of acidic sauce. There was more sauce than meat or spaghetti to where I think I need a gastric bypass. I will NOT eat from this place ever again."

Lots of random lawn furniture and picnic tables to sit at. Big enough you can invite like 10 friends and chill if you show up early to snag some space. There was someone selling bbq out of a truck across the street. One the kind of places that make you love North Brooklyn

You can smoke or vape your tobacco or (non stinky) weed. Bike here but maybe don't get too drunk. You don't wanna drunk drive home. Outdoor paradise in Williamsburg/Greenpoint!!! This place is a blank canvas and you're the paint. So wear something colorful.

That said, I finally made it out to the coffee kiosk / lot to scope out what the scene is like in person.If you're not aware, the lot radio is basically a converted shipping container rigged to stream live music 24/7 (although DJs are usually only spinning from 8-10pm ish). The station supports itself with the attached coffee kiosk that serves Brooklyn roasting (?) coffee and pastries from Dough as well as some other purveyors. The coffee is legit and the pastries are on point, but what I really love is the yard space. There's some benches, crates, and a hammock. Super low fi, and not ideal if the weather isn't great, but when it's sunny? It's paradise. I'm sitting here sipping on an iced Americano after a 6.3 mile run from south slope to greenpoint, and there's nowhere else I'd rather be."
1143,9uIP33w6K4k1Qh7lxnVSHw,10/25/2020,1 star rating,Total disregard for the fact that there is a pandemic. It's like Covid doesn't even exist here. Not following any guidelines and allowing huge groups to congregate without masks on. Avoid at all costs.

We were there on a Thursday night and the vibe was great. I would suggest getting there earlier if you don't want to be standing all night. They also serve coffee and food. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. This is a good place to go and just hang out with a group of friends.

You will never be as cool as them. You go home drunk and in the morning your clothes smell like smoke. This is how New York used to be before it was ruined by Instagram.

Piles and piles of people shoulder to shoulder with no masks. How could this be permitted?  Staff also with masks under the chin.

Well more specifically, we were waiting for a table at PDT, and International Bar was a short walk away. This typical dive bar was practically empty and just the quick drink we needed to buy time.I had a Gin & Tonic while my friends had beer that was on tap. We sat at a high top table. There were many parts of the bar I didn't get a chance to explore, like the jukebox, outdoor patio, and sandwiches. Amidst all the fancy, expensive bars in NYC, this one seems like a neighborhood go-to."

My friend who used to frequent the area said it was her favorite local hangout. Their drinks are very strong and very cheap, which is a rare treasure in New York. The White Russian cocktails come highly recommended. The main bar has a cool semi-circular shape. The bartender was friendly and the other patrons were casual and chill. The bar has a jukebox which gives it an old school vibe.I came with a group of 5 people. The bar has a decent sized outdoor patio and we initially sat there but moved inside when a few other guests started smoking. Inside, there was a large metal table with chairs in a semi-enclosed section at the back of the bar that was perfect for our group. The walls were covered in graffiti, signatures, and poetic musings, creating an intimately grungy, classic New York feel. My group was pretty loud and chatty, but everyone was respectful and left us to enjoy the space. We brought in food from another restaurant and no one seemed to mind. Great place to take visitors or friends for a quintessential East Village experience."

This spot was open on a Saturday afternoon with both seating inside and out.Standard selection of draft beers to choose from as well as a mandatory food item if staying with a drink. Decided on a pilsner ($7) and a ham sandwich ($3) while taking one of the seats outside. All things considered, not a bad sandwich - simple ham, cheese, and a spicy mustard to spread inside.Bartender here is pretty friendly and all COVID protocols are followed properly. Good dive bar to whittle away some time."

Immediately we had a security person egging on a fight after she flagged him down verbally. Him and his friends instantly hit my friend from behind directly in the back of the neck and punched me directly on the face. They made this racial, physical, disgusting, and direct. We were challenged. My friend was punched first right at the entrance of the space as we were walking out. Please review the tapes if you're reading this. He was pushed, touched, and punched. So was I. My friend went back about 30 minutes later to grab a photo of the venue snd they sent a gentleman out to knock him out, which they succeeded in. Violence is never an answer, the bar or friends of the bar directed by the bartender hit first. You can see the guy on the ground holding his head from fear. This place needs a trial and jury. You can't hit people because the bartender said to. Again, Friday 2:30 am, February 18."

Two of us have been there a hundred times if once and clearly the change of staff is impacting experience. After walking into the bar and then being accosted with a bizarre and immediate level of aggression to show our IDs by an intensely mean ""security"" guy -- who was in the back of the bar drinking  --  we ordered drinks and sat at a table minding our own business. I went to get a glass of water and the bartender ignored me for ten minutes before I finally gave up. A few minutes later she declared to the bar that it was last call and then randomly started yelling at everyone in the bar that she ""wasn't dealing with anyone's shit tonight"" and to pay their tabs and ""get the fuck out.""  My friend attempted to make a joke to her and she literally started screaming at him ""No fucking jokes. I'm not kidding. Get the fuck out. I don't want no jokes."" At which point we stood up and just walked out despite the fact that most of us still had full drinks. It was beyond nuts. After we left,  the weird ""security"" guy came outside and yelled at us as we walked down the block. I turned around and was like, ""That was really not ok. You need to talk to her."" At which point he started swearing and yelling at me. I know the previous owner unfortunately passed away. I have absolutely no idea what the hell is going on in this place now, but I do know that my friend and I are not the types to get into altercations with people especially at neighborhood bars we have frequented for years. All of this was just so completely unnecessary."

1189,is9vr6YX4NPP5cCp-K92Qw,2/20/2022,4 star rating,Food was all very good. Reservation held and table ready. Talkative crowd but not loud enough to yell LOL. Older woman server was a pistol. Helpful and friendly. Buffalo shrimp has too much breading but tasted good. Warm spinach salad was tasty but not warm. Hangar steak on sizzling platter was good BUT because it keeps cooking the meat the medium rare went medium. Next time I'll say rare. Pan roasted crispy Chicken was delicious. Home maybe tagliatelle was super! Al dente thought it would be mushy but was not. Grilled pork chop was HUGE. We laughed at how big it was. Asked for medium but was slightly dry.  Flavor and veggies were good though. Hot brownie was Amazing. Bread pudding not so much. Decaf espresso martini was great as was my Irish coffee. Would return. Don't be put off by the non- description exterior. And parking is lousy. But manageable.

Prices are reasonable and the drinks are always very good."

It's so cozy with ceiling heaters with cool carpets.   Making this a special venue. A delightful young Italian woman Iskra, greets me and seats me at great table, with a view of the busy avenue. I'm interested in dessert because I've already eaten in Manhattan at a Le Pane Quotidian. Iskra says the gluten free butternut squash cake is delicious   So I order a slice.  Boy she's not fibbing, it's moist and delicious. A nice cup of coffee I also order.  That's just perfect. Can't wait to come back for dinner!"

Who charges so much for such mediocre food in such small quantity? This is not Manhattan, this is Brooklyn, in the middle of a packed, busy, dirty, loud street. Who came up with such prices?This place is a tiny food & flower shop, but they put out outdoor tables in good weather to make some profit. This hole in a wall should not be charging such prices. Only one overwhelmed waitress was not capable of taking care of a full house of dinners. We got no service. No water. No checking in on anything. She didn't know the menu, so couldn't recommend anything or speak about any of the dishes. So not helpful. Spend your money elsewhere."

I had the shawarma pita ($14) with a side of the braised beets ($8) and YUM that was such a perfect pairing, and decently priced. My bf went with Mimi's Shakshuka w/ sausage ($18), but unfortunately we were told that they had ran out of sausage when bringing out the dish to us. Bf asked if he could sub in some chicken instead (the man just had to have his proteins!) and they were gracious enough to bring out a generous portion. We both loved the chicken shawarma (mine in a pita, his with the shakshuka) and wiped our plates clean.It was a pretty hot day, so the bf also requested an iced version of the turkish coffee. Our friendly server said she's never made one before (they're usually just hot), but would do her best for him. He thought it was good and it hit the spot; we definitely appreciated her efforts! Such a cozy outdoor space to eat on Cortelyou."

It's warm, savory, and quite filling if you want a light but satisfying meal.I've dined here for an in-person meal, which was mostly enjoyable. Unfortunately there can be many distractions and interruptions to your conversation since Cortelyou is so busy and the fire station is right across the street.I've ordered takeout a few times to bring over to nearby Sycamore Bar, which allows you to bring in food. It's the perfect sized snack/meal that's not your typical greasy bar food fare to accompany my drinks and trivia time while at Sycamore. While you wait for food, browse the imported Mediterranean groceries and selection of craft beers. I guarantee there will also be something surprising to check out and possible bring home!"

They didn't have one of the hard seltzers I wanted so they actually canceled that part of my order and then threw in 6 random drinks to make up for it. Thought that they were so nice for that! They also threw in a hummus and some homemade savory bread. They were both good but the hummus was delicious!! I had no idea this place was near me, will 100% be ordering food from here next time!"

It's a sweet neighborhood restaurant with a nice variety of levantine foods (ranging from small plates to more substantial entrees). I especially enjoy their al fresco dining, which is lovely in temperate weather. Fortunately, because the outdoor seating is well covered, it's pleasant to sit outside even on a rainy day (as I did this rainy afternoon). Sitting outside on a sunny day with a glass of their house white wine and a small plate of spiced carrots is a great joy. I love the mushroom hummus, the bowls, the small plates. It's all good. Recommended if you just want a nice place to chill out on Cortelyou."

The sad part is when the delivery drivers call about an order the workers scream at them when in all actuality it's their own faults. I will never order from them again. It was better when the old owners had the place.

The main chef personally cooks all the dishes and they're all incredibly delicious and authentic! What makes it even better? It's relatively cheap compare to other restaurants around! For example, a double cooked pork over rice was $7.50; not only was it incredibly delicious with its sweet and savory sauce, but it was a hefty portion too! The waitress is also very friendly and all you have to do is ask for whatever you need and she will bring it to you in seconds.

The steamed rice dishes are so over-steamed that the rice is close to being congee. My fried pork chop rice, the pork was so over deep fried that the meat was dry and tough. Also you can tell they have not cleaned their deep fryer in awhile as there was black fry specs allover the pork chop. They also raised prices from a year ago. If your going to raise prices at least give people quality food."

Then you will need to throw out your own trash at the near by garbage bin. Since it's communal , you will have strangers sitting next to you but that's normal for Asian restaurants. The food was ok, we had the lotus rice with broccoli and garlic shrimp. And then we also got the lotus rice with eggplant and broccoli.: not sure why each rice dish comes with broccoli and not other types of veggies. Would be better if we had a variety of veggies for each dish and not the same thing.... the price was decent around $6-8 per dish. Will prob come back again. Highly recommend the baked fish rice dish with tomato sauce. This dish was very delicious compared to the other ones!"
1233,2roGBLPFp4X0sgmWuFEEBQ,4/30/2018,3 star rating,"I was pretty excited to try this place after seeing all the pictures but it is quite deceiving. Was going to come here with my family for my mom's birthday but after seeing it wasn't much of a restaurant, we took it to go.They currently have no paper menu and only have the menu behind the register. A lot of the items were marked 'coming soon'. We ordered 3 lotus leaf steamers to go and waited about 15-20 minutes.We ordered the cured meat, chicken with mushroom and tri-cup chicken. The cured meat was such a disappointment. Based on the picture posted by the owner, the steamer was filled with meat. We only had a small portion of meat and it lacked a lot of flavor. The chicken and mushroom was another disappointment. The chicken had no flavor at all and wasn't salty at all. We added soy sauce to it and still didn't help. Our favorite would have to be the tri-cup chicken. It was flavorful and they gave a lot of chicken. There was plenty of sauce as well which added a lot of flavor to the rice. The portions are huge and definitely cheap for $7 to $7.50. I just wish there was more flavor to some of the steamers. Will definitely be coming back to try the other steamers and other items on the menu. If you check in on Yelp or order online, you get $2 off your $20+ purchase!"

Portion is big, but lacked flavour and hardly tasted any of the lotus- had to use lots of soy sauce. The Brown sugar tasted okay- much like any bakery iced coffee. It's convenient for locals around the area, even have online promotional deals. Wouldn't really go out of my way for the food though."

My boyfriend and I got Hainan Chicken with rice and a fried noodle.  Both are very salty and spicy. I don't recommend anyone to visit this place if they are craving for some good Chinese food.P.S. They gave us a piece of chicken that doesn't have meat at all. This is one of the worst Chinese restaurants I have ever been to in this neighborhood. 1/10.

We couldn't see if the order went through and when we attempted to call, the phone rang and rang and rang without anyone answering.  Eventually, we got through after 45 mins and when they told us the food is on its way, the person that delivered the food left it on our porch. Didn't even ring our bell or called our number. If it wasn't for RING, we would have been waiting longer. Disappointed with their respond/service: and food,"

A great deal for $6.50 -black pepper seitan- this is a hefty portion. It's not spicy but has a nice peppery flavor. The seitan was nice and hearty. It tasted like they pan fried it a bit so it was a bit crispy. Note that this comes with Chinese broccoli - not regular- and a lot of it! Also cheap- $13So glad I finally found a vegetarian Chinese spot that's on point in terms of flavor and value. I'll be ordering again!"

Clean restaurant which always makes everything even better.
1242,FJFliqqHXFZutkp_dmWdfw,9/29/2021,5 star rating,A great place for vegan food. It's like a moment of zen kind of. Zen Vegetarian House is in Flatbush pretty close to Prospect Park. Had such a big menu for a small place so it's quite a hidden spot for the curious. There's lots of interesting things to choose from that look and taste a lot like the real thing. It has an all vegetarian menu. Seriously there's no need to ask them. The majority of things are also vegan. At lunch they have specials and you save a lot. The specials are about $7.50 and come with a choice of a spring roll or soup. I had the Eggplant With Soy Chicken and the spring roll. She had the Tofu Teriyaki. I thought it was excellent. Lots of the purple eggplant among other vegetables. Big pieces of the soy chicken. The spring roll was crispy and didn't taste like it was frozen like at many places. Eating inside is hard because it's very small so most people get carryout. It also isn't a wonderful area but it's not scary. This is one of the best choices in Flatbush for vegans.

An incredibly generous offer and very appreciated. Thank you, Zen Vegetarian House."

Along with the sauce I can eat it all without sharing but I'll get back to the food in a few. 1st off I had to use the rest room badly and ran into this restaurant. No one turned up their face and said customers only which sold me. Inside reminded me of a typical chinese store. Nothing lavishing. However everyone was really kind. Besides the chicken nuggets I ordered the shrimp fried rice and chicken and broccoli with white rice. The food was excellent. I have no complaints.  If you're vegan or vegetarian do not sleep on this spot. You wont be disappointed. Even if you eat meat give it a try.
1246,FJFliqqHXFZutkp_dmWdfw,3/4/2021,5 star rating,"Literally everything was delicious. The ""chicken"" and broccoli was the best vegan version ever. I did find the faux meat a bit chewy, so I would recommend cutting it into smaller pieces and not eating it like a feral animal (like I did).Chocolate cake was perfect! Moist and a BIG slice. Lo mein was perfectly cooked and filled with vegetables, but not enough to the point where I felt I had gotten little to no noodle. Food was well packed and served warm."

You get what you'd expect at Knickerbocker- excellent bagels with a crispy outside, warm, soft, flavorful inside, and that ephemeral  ""bagel"" taste. You know the one. It's what you fall back on when you can't describe what's missing from a ""good"" bagel anywhere else in the country. There's also the NY miracle of ""how is this thing milliseconds from being undercooked?"" It's a science, clearly, more than an art. They cool and prove that's not uncooked dough. It's perfection.Or, maybe it is the water. The shmears were stellar, a cut above really. We got the Cucumber dill because- (whaaaa!?) and it did not disappoint. It was great on any bagel we threw at it. Our only regret is we didn't have some lox to put in the mix."

1249,OtqShhp-cOByPzzdTMZu6w,3/12/2023,5 star rating,Delicious NY bagels with quick delivery service. We had the everything and onion bagels with cream cheese to-go so we could toast at home. Were fresh all weekend.
1250,OtqShhp-cOByPzzdTMZu6w,9/11/2022,5 star rating,"Yes. Absolutely love. There's some mediocre bagel places out there, this is not one of them. The service is great, even when it's busy. They're always so happy and energetic. The line moves fairly quick. My go-to is the Spicy Mama (egg, Cajun Turkey, pepper jack cheese, and chipotle cream cheese), sub the chipotle cream cheese for the bacon sriracha (trust me). The bagel texture is beautiful, always fresh. Drink selection is outstanding. Get yourself a probiotic soda to down after that thicc bagel, your stomach will thank you. Any time after 11am during the weekend is usually packed. Early morning or weekdays are your best bet if you're in a hurry."
1251,OtqShhp-cOByPzzdTMZu6w,10/3/2022,5 star rating,"This place had glowing reviews from friends in the neighborhood, so had to check it out. I cannot oversell this place; I've had many bagels, but the Loxury bagel here ($16) slaps. It's huge (I shared it with another person) and generously loaded with lox! They have an amazing variety of bagel and cream cheese flavors, including garlic and egg everything bagels and jalapeno lox and bacon scallion cream cheeses. There's definitely something for everyone here."
1252,OtqShhp-cOByPzzdTMZu6w,3/13/2023,5 star rating,"If you're hungry for brunch in Brooklyn, I highly recommend Knickerbocker Bagel. All the food is fresh, fruit bowls are made daily and the taste is spectacular. I ordered the stuffed French toast with cinnamon apple and I have yet to taste a better french toast. I had it 3 days in a row and every time I was blown away at how well this dish was made. The toast is soft but still sits heavy in your stomach, it isn't overwhelmingly sweet, and they give you great portions. Definitely a 10/10 breakfast"
1253,OtqShhp-cOByPzzdTMZu6w,2/21/2022,5 star rating,Having stopped here more than I'd like to admit I'm starting to think this place may be one of the best bagel spots in Brooklyn. Yes its kinda out of the way depending on where you live but the bagels here are definitely worth the trip. Knickerbocker bagel as I said before has the characteristics that make it a damn near perfect bagel! sort of chewy/crispy exterior without it being too doughy in the inside while covered in seeds.Utopia and knickerbocker bagels so far are my top two bagel spots in the whole of NYC!
1254,OtqShhp-cOByPzzdTMZu6w,8/27/2022,5 star rating,"Best bagels we had our entire trip!! Went back here a few times because it was that good. Everything bagel with scallion cream cheese is to die for, get it!"
1255,OtqShhp-cOByPzzdTMZu6w,12/30/2022,5 star rating,"This spot never disappoints. You can literally put anything on a bagel here and it'll be amazing because of how fresh these bagels are. Nothing beats a classic New York bagel. Their cream cheese spreads are so unique and flavorful - I can't wait to come back and try more. This is an everything bagel with Egg, American cheese, vegetable sausage, avocado, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers and mini everything bagel with jalapeño Asiago cream cheese! The mini bagels are great to try the spreads!"
1256,OtqShhp-cOByPzzdTMZu6w,8/17/2022,5 star rating,"This was my first time trying a bagel shop in Bushwick and this place definitely hit the spot. The prices were so reasonable compared to the city. In the city it would've been already $10 for anything Lox related. They are so generous with the filling that I couldn't fit the bagel in one bite. I recommend spreading the cream cheese on both sides of the bagel and take it apart to eat. Still delicious, but easier to eat that way. I will definitely be returning if I am in the area!"

From the moment you enter, there is such a warm and welcoming demeanor from every single person there. We were able to get seated right away, despite it being super busy.Our server Krystle was superb. She knew the menu inside and out, made recommendations about what we should try. I had the French toast and Ethiopian style fries. Heavenly. My cocktail- the Fig Fig Bang Bang- was delicious- slightly sweet with a smoky finish. Ended the meal with a Berry Cake which was superb- i love the tartness of it.The space is filled with artwork and plants and is just absolutely beautiful. they have a DJ booth and i was informed that they do have a DJ every Friday and Saturday night. I will definitely have to checkit out.A fun, creative and innovative spin on Ethiopian cuisine. 10/10 Highly recommended!"
1258,roT-M9epcHDOGjYgGmWpoA,3/18/2023,2 star rating,"Service is superb, but the food was not what was expected. I took my friend here for her birthday, it was our first time having it be Ethiopian food. The food can in shareable plates, and it's a great place to experience the overall experience of being connected with your food. The atmosphere overall was lay back and relax. So definitely a place you canctake your friend if you want to just hang out and talk.Most of their food is served cold, we ordered the popular dishes and the sampler so we can try a bit of everything. Everything is eaten with the flat bread (I'm sure there's an actual name for this), the bread was soft, and had a bit of a sour taste. It was something that's foreign to us, and we don't really know how we feel. It was definitely a new experience, the food was very flavorful, definitely worth a try, but not a place I would come back and visit again."
1259,roT-M9epcHDOGjYgGmWpoA,2/4/2023,5 star rating,"Ok I may convert to vegan  or Atleast incorporate more plant based eating into my diet . This Ethiopian vegan restaurant is a must try. We started off with their sambusa which was so flaky and filled with spiced lentils , we also got the butternut squash sambusa. Both are delicious. We got the avocado mash with injera chips - it is definitely a must have- super creamy and the injera chips are abolsutely divine - if they would make those and sell them I wojld definitely by them.We got the Mercato and piassa platters because we had to try everything . Our favorite was the piassa particularly the tater kik - yellow split peas and the Alisha shiro- chickpeas. Even though we were stuffed ( 3 people) and had plenty leftover food to go home we had to try some dessert ! We got the coconut leche and omg was it good. It was creamy and not too sweet a perfect end to a great lunch. Also did I mention even though we were stuffed we didn't have that gross feeling you have when you've eaten too much lol ! We will definitely be back to ras plant based in the future and look forward to incorporating more plant based eating into our weekly menus."

1261,roT-M9epcHDOGjYgGmWpoA,3/21/2023,5 star rating,I've been waiting forever to try Ras and it did not disappoint! Such amazing Ethiopian food with amazing flavors and a very fun atmosphere. We ordered both platters and both were delicious. Each platter comes with enough to probably split with another person or eat on your own if you're hungry. Service was quick and very attentive. I'd come back for the food because it was just so good. Cocktails here also looked really nice. They do a great job on presentation and amazing job with flavors. Definitely a place I'd take my out of town friends for a cool eating experience that's sure to impress.
1262,roT-M9epcHDOGjYgGmWpoA,3/25/2023,5 star rating,"My friend and I get dinner once a month, this month was my turn to choose and I selected Crown Heights. My usual game plan involves 2 or 3 savory restaurants and 1 or 2 dessert spots. After doing my research on Yelp, I knew I wanted to start our night at Ras Plant Based.We arrived a little after 6 on a Thursday and lucked out that a table was available, they were booked pretty solid. All of the staff were pleasant and our waiter was fantastic. He directed us towards his favorite dishes and they were perfect. We opened up with squash filled pastries. They were perfectly crispy and the dipping sauce had excellent zest. For an entree we went with the seitan on injera. The seitan had great texture in a wonderful sauce, certainly didn't miss meat. The injera itself was perfection, light and airy but substantial enough to wrap the seitan. By the end of the night, one of my regrets was that we didn't order more at Ras.Very cool art on the walls, nice lightning, an all around fun place to eat."
1263,roT-M9epcHDOGjYgGmWpoA,12/4/2022,5 star rating,"Ras Plant Based is an amazing Ethiopian spot with a beautiful interior in Brooklyn. Loved coming here for dinner on a Friday night. The tables were very tightly packed and almost too small for what we ordered, but the food and service was amazing! Tried the Ginger Guava Lemonade cocktail and the Wet Ass Passionfruit. They were both so delicious! For our meal, my friend and I shared the mushroom ribs, and both the Piassa and Mercato platters were amazing! The platters are a great way to try multiple things, definitely hard to pick a favorite between the two, but would recommend deciding based on which veggies you like or don't; eg beets, collard greens Everything was so flavorful and overall very filling. The injera was great. Will definitely be back!"
1264,roT-M9epcHDOGjYgGmWpoA,9/9/2022,4 star rating,"Short review: Really tasty but pretty pricey food. Get the special tibs. Desserts are excellent with special note going to their choco mango but the rest were not too shabby. The platters are also good with my preference of the two being the mercato due to the nicer variety of textures and I think overall better flavors but the other wasn't bad at all.Anyway, I went to this Ethiopian spot with several others. The prices are a bit high but the quality of the food was overall quite nice especially for vegan or vegetarian food and even as someone who prefers generally eating meat, I still found myself satisfied. It was a little bit loud in there especially with the music but overall the ambience was nice. For a drink, I got the Wet Ass Passion Fruit which contained rum, Vida mezcal, passion fruit, and lime. It was a very tropical cocktail which partially masked the flavor of the rum and it was pretty tasty. We decided to get one of each of the mixed plates for each of our groups along with two of the separate dishes both with injera. Our two main dishes were the Ras Special Tibs with sauteed seitan, tomato, jalapeno, zesty berbere sauce, and onion and our other was the Ras Kitfo with pea protein crumble, spice infused olive oil, and mitmita. Of the two, I preferred the special tibs. It might be because I actually like the texture of seitan or because it would closer to the original meat based dishes. The flavors were also really nice and if I was to go back here alone I would probably get this and one of the appetizers or desserts and be satisfied. The latter didn't exactly taste like kitfo but then again they're trying to imitate a dish made from raw beef tartare mixed with clarified butter and spices but I did like the texture of said dish. I'm usually not a fan of pea protein but in this case it worked quite well. The platters consisted of the following all served on top of injera of course:Mercato:Yatakilt-Cabbage, carrot, onion, bell pepperGomen-Braised collards, sauteed onionsMisisr- Slow simmered red lentil stew, fiery berbere sauceShiro- Creamy ground chickpeas, intricate spice blendFasolia- String beans, carrots, caramelized Onions PiassaKeysir- Savory beetroot, carrot, onionDiffin Misir- Brown lentil, onion, fenugreekYater Kik- Yellow split pea, onion, jalapeno, intricate spice blendAlichi Siro- Mild chickpea, onion, holy basil, garlic, gingerZucchini- Creamy zucchini, tomatoes, carrots, celery, parsley As mentioned in the short review, I preferred the mercato. There was much more variety of textures and outside of the excellent beetroot, I generally found the piassa ones to be blander compared to similar dishes I have found at other Ethiopian spots. Special notes to the braised collards, cabbage, and string beans among the mercato being my favorite of the dishes.For dessert which for some reason is not on their site, we decided to go with three of their vegan cakes. Choco Mango: Cashews, mango, dates, coconut oil, agave, coconut flakes, cacao powder, lemon juice, vanilla extract, Himalayan salt, and freeze-dried raspberryCoconut Leche: Young coconut, cashews, almonds, dates, coconut oil, agave, coconut flakes, sunflower lecithin, vanilla extract, and Himalayan salt Trisome Berry: Cashews, pecans, dates, mixed berries, coconut oil, agave, cacao, lemon juice, raspberry, Himalayan salt, and vanilla I'm generally not a big fan of vegan desserts unless they are naturally vegan and not trying to imitate something else but the ones listed above were a nice change of pace. The choco mango was my preference having a wonderful sourness and a pretty good texture. The coconut leche was a well flavored coconut cake but a bit dry which is expected as there isn't any milk or something similar to make it moist (I presume the oil is for that, maybe some type of plant milk would work.) The trisome berry was also good with some light sourness but it was a bit less flavored and it had a bit of that unpleasant texture I partially expect from most vegan desserts. Overall not shabby and in terms of vegan desserts way better than I expected.Overall the food was pretty tasty especially for vegan food. I would say that it was a bit pricey for the quality but if you're looking for a vegan substitute, this place is quite good. Low 4."
1265,roT-M9epcHDOGjYgGmWpoA,8/9/2022,4 star rating,"Extremely delicious vegan Ethiopian food! Flavors are ON POINT and everything just tastes so good! The sambusas are a wonderful appetizer to get- perfectly flaky and crispy. Have tried all the different fillings- veggie, lentil & squash- all on different occasions. All are good! Lentil is more hearty; squash is a bit more unique! The pastry is definitely the best part. They are served piping hot and fresh. The accompanying hot sauce compliments it very well. The platters are a great way to try many different types of dishes. I personally liked the Mercato more than the other platter (since I don't like beets as much). The Mercato platter has a great variety of veggie and legume dishes. All are well-flavored and tasty. I personally loved the cabbage, green beans and red lentil the most. The chickpea dish was the slightly disappointing one- while tasty, it was an extremely small portion. It is a very smooth chickpea purée and almost like a sauce/gravy instead of one of the platter items.I would say the portion was 2-3 tablespoons. Very little and wish that was more generous! Of note- they do not allow any substitutions for the platters. I wish they had an option to choose any 5 items for the platter! That would be awesome and would definitely encourage me to go more often.The mushroom tibs dish was A STAR. Highly recommend. Perfect seasoning + spice from jalapeños. I will definitely be getting the mushroom tibs again. Sooo delicious and went perfectly with the injera. Loved the injera provided- the entrees and platters are served on injera already. You get to choose an  additional starch as well-- more injera, or brown rice. So if you can't decide, you do get injera on the plate already if you did want to try the brown rice. Although I do think for me, injera is one of the main reasons I love eating Ethiopian food because it is so unique to this cuisine- so I want all I can get! It does fill you up for sure. It seems not that filling because it is thin, but the spongy texture + hearty dishes definitely adds up for a very filling meal! If you never had injera, it is slightly sour, due to fermentation. It MAY be an acquired taste, but I feel that it goes very well with the dishes! They drinks were ok. I forgot what my drink was called- it was watermelon with ginger beer. Definitely light and refreshing, but I expected stronger ginger taste. The pineapple coconut rum drink was good- but I expected more pineapple so a bit more tangy. Probably personal preference! It was not bad :) Ambience wise- the vibe is definitely amazing. Vibrant music, live DJ (at least when I went on a weekend), colorful wall paintings, awesome decor etc. Just FYI that it is LOUD in there. It is hard to hear even the person right across you. Don't expect to catch up / have conversations here easily as you will have to talk very loudly the whole meal. Probably a combination of everyone constantly talking at the top of their lungs just to hear each other, adding to the noise. Overall, Ras Plant Based serves amazing, delicious, Ethiopian food that is ALL vegan!! Love this place and will come back for the sambusas and mushroom tibs for sure!"
1266,roT-M9epcHDOGjYgGmWpoA,12/8/2022,5 star rating,"Vegan Ethiopian food. If your friends aren't ready to throw down, it could be because they hate mess or it's because they hate having a good time. The food is amazing. The seitan tibs were a favorite and were particularly oily and spicy (you will need some extra injera). I loved the mushroom tibs the most (a fungivore), but loved the traditional cabbage mix, mesir wat, stewed greens and lentils. Everything is always delicious.The cocktails are AMAZING. I had a coconut pineapple drink where I straight up exclaimed after the first sip because I was delighted at how good it was.Crowd pleaser, accessible to everyone unless you have a real pill of a carnivorous omnivore. I think I saw an employee with the shirt ""good vibes only""And wayyyyyy more"

We've ordered their 30 pcs wings twice for delivery/pick up already and they're always deliciously crispy and juicy.When our Uber Eats driver arrived though he said it took so long that he almost wanted to cancel. Just a heads up for delivery orders.
1269,P0OilvtjGnUQgf7hFzEgcg,12/4/2022,4 star rating,"Let's get into it shall we? This was my second time at MFC. I expected consistency and that's exactly what I got. The plan was originally Chinese for the night, but long wait time means change in plans. We stuck to the Asian theme though. And you can't go wrong with Korean, especially when it's your favorite. I mean it's CHICKEN! Food: I got my staple--tteokbokki (spicy Korean rice cakes) and the mixed soy/spicy soy garlic chicken. Large portions means I wanted for nothing. My friends got soy chicken as well and I mean-- the silence after the food came was all I needed to know. Now, my friends did order the bulgogi over rice and the mac and cheese. Consensus on the mac and cheese was that it lacking OOMPH. Ten's exact words on the bulgogi was ""It provides sustenance."" Which doesn't inspire confidence. Hence the 4/5.Drinks: If you go for Korean fried chicken, you must get beer. Even better, soju. And to really complete the experience, you just make a somaek--a soju and beer bomb. I was going to order a cocktail, but we got so busy talking and catching up that it just slipped by. But I got grapefruit and green grape soju and a Sapporo to finish it off.I've never been a fan of green grape soju, so I stuck to my grapefruit and was quite content! Service was awesome: our waitress was lovely; quick, attentive and funny. You can't go wrong. Of course I'll be back. Here's how you know the food was great--I didn't even take pictures. As always, happy eating and drinking! MarieMG."

1271,P0OilvtjGnUQgf7hFzEgcg,1/24/2023,3 star rating,Not the first time here and I have to say it not as good as it used to be pre pandemic. My daughter loves their Mac n cheese and we both were disappointed in it. The consistency of it was totally off. Super watery lacked in flavor. Fried dumplings were good. We got half hot half mild and if you do not like SPICY  do not order the hot ones they will have your mouth on fire . We also ordered the scallion chicken which has been pretty good and it was still good. So they didn't miss on that. Service is terrible. No one came by while/ after we got our food to check on us. Our water was low and not to mention getting warm and until we asked did we get refills and more ice. Place isn't that crowded and pretty quiet. It was a Tuesday evening. And they didn't seem to be that busy inside. But.. I don't think I'll come back to sit inside. If anything I will order the chicken again but to go!! Not worth the tip for mediocre service.

At this cross roads of Korean and American comfort food you can find dishes like wings with authentic Korean sauces and kimchi fried rice, to name a few. I've eaten at their location a few times as well. It's a large, comfortable area that slightly reminiscent of a more well kept sports bar that allows for large groups of friends to gather where you can actually hear each other speak. On my most recent occasion I got an order of their spicy boneless wings to go. These never disappoint and always leave me wanting more later in the week. I'd definitely check this spot out if you're in the area."

I was wondering why are all these school kids in their uniforms up in McDonalds at 11AM?  why the hell aren't u in class? HAD to have the newly restored steak egg and cheese bagel, that's back on the breakfast menu. had errands to run before I got there. I said let me preorder my food on the app cause I was running late, knowing breakfast usually's a wrap at 10:30. Done. Got there a little after 10:30, and breakfast was still on and poppin. It went to 11AM. Ordered a hash brown, and a large coffee as well. The app currently doesnt allow you to stipulate how you want your coffee creamed. WTF. So I went up to the counter, and asked for two half & halfs. The lady politely asked if i wanted her to put it in. I declined. Let me do it. The food was good. Hash brown wasn't hot, but I coulda asked for a fresh one out of the oil. When I go here, I never have a problem. I believe that some people receive the service they get, because they're out of pocket with people. Never disrespect the people who make your food. They'll teach you a lesson you'll never forget."

This is a predominantly Spanish location so the staff are equipped to communicate in both English and Spanish. Love this! I usually stop by for breakfast when it's less busy.

I was wondering why are all these school kids in their uniforms up in McDonalds at 11AM?  why the hell aren't u in class? HAD to have the newly restored steak egg and cheese bagel, that's back on the breakfast menu. had errands to run before I got there. I said let me preorder my food on the app cause I was running late, knowing breakfast usually's a wrap at 10:30. Done. Got there a little after 10:30, and breakfast was still on and poppin. It went to 11AM. Ordered a hash brown, and a large coffee as well. The app currently doesnt allow you to stipulate how you want your coffee creamed. WTF. So I went up to the counter, and asked for two half & halfs. The lady politely asked if i wanted her to put it in. I declined. Let me do it. The food was good. Hash brown wasn't hot, but I coulda asked for a fresh one out of the oil. When I go here, I never have a problem. I believe that some people receive the service they get, because they're out of pocket with people. Never disrespect the people who make your food. They'll teach you a lesson you'll never forget."

This particular order they didn't put 3 burgers in the bag, the last time they forgot my kids nuggets. Now if I want to eat, I'll have to reorder the burgers pay an additional delivery fee as well as service charges and another tip. This location is beyond ghetto and they just don't care. Also all 4 of my fries were half full."

Good quality is good and what you would expect from a well run McDonald's location. The dining area and bathroom is currently closed due to CoVID restrictions. I suggest placing a mobile order to avoid having to stand in line. Mobile kiosks are available to order at as well. The staff are friendly in my experience. This is a predominantly Spanish location so the staff are equipped to communicate in both English and Spanish. Love this! I usually stop by for breakfast when it's less busy.

I'm not going to mention all of the competitors nearby, after all this is a review about McDonald's. This location is about a half mile from my apartment. When I'm visiting the Conservatory Gardens or the nearby museums I sometimes come here for brunch. My favorite is the big breakfast. I'm known for completing a survey to get free cookies. They're fresh baked daily. The food is fast and service with a smile. It's typical McDonald's. It's Hit or Miss regarding cleanliness. If you like fast and cheap it's close to the 105th Street transportation hub. The  Subway and buses are close by. Just so you know. You're welcome."

1320,9N098o3vpvAsrb6b7eMZTw,4/27/2022,3 star rating,"This tiny place is combined with a Cinnabon and basically like a walk up kiosk. So no seating and no restroom. The location is prime! Right by port authority, buses with lines of tourists, and the subway exactly right next to it. So I was there at 11am right when it's supposedly open. Very busy area. Waited 20 min and no one ever came to open up shop. Left and tried calling at 12:30 and still no answer. Who knows when they opened but finally someone answered in the afternoon and said yea sometimes things come up and we don't open but usually it's 11. Hmmm strange. Anyway I was back in the area in the evening and got in that big line since I was craving a pretzel all day! Since they were behind on orders, I waited maybe 30 min. At last - a fresh hot cinnamon sugar pretzel was out and in my hand! This really hit the spot since it was freshly made. Patience is a virtue... finally a hot pretzel in my hand."
1321,9N098o3vpvAsrb6b7eMZTw,12/1/2021,2 star rating,If you want to stand on line go here. If you want to get a pretzel better go somewhere else. Its location is off the beaten path. If you're not aware of its presence you probably won't visit. There's always a line since it's around the corner from Times Square. Inside the store is like to buy two so you only fit one person or two people in at a time. Whenever I stopped by staff is short is only two or three people behind the counter and not a lot of pretzels being made. I've been to this location twice and I've gotten half my order half of the time. The last time they don't even have my item ready and told me it would be a 10 minute wait mind you I just watched 8 people leave the store with only one item. So what do they have ready?

Then she tells me she only has salt pretzels and so if I want a sour cream and onion pretzel I have to wait. So I'm like okay how long do I have to wait for? She screams to her coworkers and they literally say we don't know how long it will take. Are you serious? You bake pretzels all day, you work for a franchise with standard operating procedures and you don't know how long it will take to bake your most standard product?? Then I decide to tell her I'll wait but that I had a coupon. The coupon says buy one pretzel and get a free cinnamon or original pretzel but she claims i can only get a cinnamon or original to get a free original or cinnamon. This of couurse was not the case and I even got another email verifying that I could buy any pretzel and get a cinnamon or original for free. I don't often write negative reviews but the attitude on the whole staff was just ridiculous and they clearly did not care about their customer.

Auntie Anne's Pretzel can be easily veganized just by asking to make a fresh batch without butter. You only have to wait less than 10 minutes for it to be baked. The staff never gave me any problems when I ask to make a fresh batch. My favorite is the sweet almonds. So yummy. The advantage of this is you always get fresh pretzel out of the oven.

We were lucky enough to get seated right away, though the Yelp waitlist showed an approximate wait of 15 minutes. I ordered the spiraulina latte and spinach ricotta Danish, and they ended up having neither of those things, so instead I had the ham and cheese croissant ($10) and a matcha latte ($4.50). The matcha latte was sizable but barely tasted like matcha. Instead, it felt like drinking a big cup of steamed milk, which is fine, but that's not what I paid for. The croissant was toasted but it definitely didn't have that nice crispness that you'd  get with a really good croissant; it tasted not super fresh. Service was good, though it took a while for all of our dishes to come."

I am the friend mentioned that does not consume alcohol in a previous post and when I saw the owner's response, it is evident that a lack of accountability and respect for patrons is common place at every level in this establishment. The bar was sparsely populated, we came in without being ID'd (bars responsibility) and were simply enjoying the social environment. After standing and chatting for 20 mins into being there a group of folks got up and we noticed after 5 minutes of the tables remaining empty and that we should just take a seat at one of two empty tables. Within 5 minutes the bartender came over and asked if we are going to order a drink, I responded first saying no (because I no longer drink due to my sobriety). The bartender with a disgusting condescending attitude expeditiously stated ""then y'all need to get out.""  The owner's response takes no responsibility for the lack of respect for the customer. If it were an age thing, check our IDs, we are both over 30. If it were us bringing in anything from another establishment, you would've seen us drinking or whatever else you want to scapegoat. Wish y'all nothing but the worst. Cheers. 0/10. I would never recommend this place to any one. Do not go."

I ordered a couple drinks and paid cash. waiting on the my change I was surprised to hear the bartender insist my $19 return ( on a $21 bill) was his to keep. I asked for my change but I was subsequently ignored. Biting the bullet, I (foolishly) returned to the bar with another $20 to buy more drinks. I order two drinks ($21) and asked the bartender to use my remaining balance. Disappointingly, the bartender proceeded to take a sip of my drink (in mocking) and actually put my money into the register before then ignoring me (and the situation) to dance mockingly. Leaving me with no drink, no refund and egg on my face as the bartender proceeded to goad me. Honestly it's not my top three bar but I was enjoying the atmosphere with friends. It's disappointing to see a bartender so entitled to a tip without providing even basic services. Both bartenders the night of December 17 2022 clearly revealed a disdain for a paying customer and worse of all their antagonism only served to make the situation more frustrating , to me that's the exact opposite of  hospitality and bar service. In the end the cash amount is trivial.I didn't get my drink, I didn't get a refund and I didn't enjoy the rest of my night. So pretty much lose - lose on all sides for me.I will definitely not be visiting this bar ever again."

While we were sitting we were approached by one of the bartenders who ask if we were getting a drink , we replied not right now. He then replied if you're not getting a drink then you have to leave! Note, the bar was not full at all and no one else was standing waiting for a seat plus this is a dive bar. It is interesting that the two African Americans were approached in such a rude manner! When some of the other patrons who also weren't drinking were not approached. So question: Can people only come to this bar if they are drinking? Can they not come for the music, to play pool, to converse? How did you not know that although I may not have bought a drink then I wouldn't return and frequent this establishment? Need less to say we left! I would NEVER recommend this rude establishment!"

I stumbled upon this restaurant because it is near my favorite ice cream spot and I'm so Glad I did! I am a picky eater and not always open to trying new things, but after trying the food here a first time, I couldn't help but coming back a second third and fourth time all within a few weeks. We've tried the chicken main dish, the lamb main disk, the fish main dish and all the dips that go with the fresh pita bread and falafels. Everything was amazing, the flavors, the spices, the texture. Loved every bite of every dish we've ordered. I will be coming back another four times this upcoming month. If you're reading this review, I Hope to see you there!"

The bar area is also very nice and appealing to sit at. Service: The manager, the waitress, and all staff were so nice and thoughtful. Fairly quick to get to you even though it was busy. Food: EXCELLENT. As a vegetarian, I really enjoyed the number of options on the menu and they all sounded delicious. The Indian Tahini ended up being one of our favorite dips and the falafel was well seasoned and crispy. Must try the Taboon bread, it's fresh and hot and perfectly seasoned. We also got the Israeli salad which definitely did not disappoint. The Malabi dessert was fresh, sweet, and a perfect ending to the entire meal. Overall I'd say this was a great experience and I would definitely come back and bring friends."

Just every dish I've tried from there was perfect. I've been here a couple times. The last time was for my birthday and we had like the whole back patio to ourselves (they cover it because it was in January and it was cold). The staff was so friendly. It's my favorite way to eat, sample platter and everyone shares. We ordered tons of dishes because we had like 10 people. The spicy feta was particularly incredible, and they have this homemade taboon bread? Can't remember the name exactly. My mouth literally starts watering thinking about it! I can't think of anything we got that was super delicious. This is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in the UWS and in New York!"
1351,1p4dUaLyzIhN5n1lJnHSgA,11/4/2022,5 star rating,"Bustan is probably one of my favorite places for Mediterranean food in the Upper West Side. It is very manageable to get a reservation even with just a day in advance and the food/ambiance are top notch. Most recently, I went with a group of 4 on a Wednesday evening. We decided to sit on their outdoor patio since the night was very nice and cool. They also have plenty of indoor seating which is also available if you'd rather get more of a dimly lit, romantic ambiance. Their menu is meant for sharing items so you can order different dishes from each section for your whole group. For my table we ordered: Pita: incredibly fluffy pita that comes fresh out of the oven and very warm.  It is medium in thickness and comes in a portion size that is decent but honestly it's so addicting I always wish I ordered more (especially to have some with the larger entrees). Taboon Bread: another bread that's thicker than the pita and a bit more flavorful as it is drizzled with olive oil and some salt. Very solid choice as well. Would suggest getting both since they each have a unique beauty to them. Hummus: pretty good! The appetizer portion is small so I think I'd get the medium hummus bowl to split between everyone for bigger groups since this is a very popular item! Creamy, tangy, yummy. Spicy Feta: super good dip! This was a table favorite. Creamy and salty-- a perfect pairing with the soft breads. Definitely get this one. The sumac on it compliments the creaminess well. Eggplant Carpaccio: reminded me of baba ghanoush in flavor but with a more aesthetic presentation. Liked it but I prefer the hummus in terms of flavor and texture! Would order again just for the presentation though. Israeli Salad: incredibly refreshing and a perfect addition to your meal for some healthy veggies. Loved how small the vegetables were chopped! Made the texture so satisfying. Perfectly dressed with what is evidently very high quality olive oil and a generous amount of lemon/ herbs. Roasted Cauliflower: probably my favorite cauliflower dish in all of New York City. I don't know how the heck they make this but it's so flavorful and tender on the inside even when it's slightly burnt on the outside. It comes over labneh that is very rich and tangy and creamy. It also has a nice contrast of crushed fresh tomatoes that add some acidity which really ties it together. Would come back just for this. Cauliflower lovers must order! Chicken Musakhan: exceptional dish of this chicken that is perfectly crispy on the outside with a tender and juicy interior. It is marinaded in different spices (including some cinnamon), and served with toasted almonds over taboon bread and with some watercress and olive oil. Honestly, this was so freaking good, I wish I had ordered one for myself. The portion size is good for around 1-2 people so I would order more than one large dish next time if I am in a bigger group! So good. This place has still not disappointed me and held up incredibly high standards in terms of service, food, and ambiance for the two years I have been to it. I love how accessible it feels since it's easy to get a reservation and it's convenient location in the UWS. Prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity of food you get and the service is very good too! Looking forward to returning again in the future for another delicious meal."
1352,1p4dUaLyzIhN5n1lJnHSgA,8/15/2022,5 star rating,"If I could rate this even higher then 5 stars, I would. If you are looking for something different to try, look no further and just walk into Bustan. Before I explain the food - - I would like to caveat that I brought my friend here who is from Lebanon. So she is VERY picky with any kind of Mediterranean food and she RAVED about her experience here. The ambience is amazing. You walk in and all the employees are very welcoming. Warm vibes and a cozy / funky vibe at the same time. Now for the food. Everything was better then the last. First of all, the pita is incredibly fresh and so delicious. I'm not typically a bread before dinner person, but I would actually order the pita to go. Dipped this in the crazy feta (a typical fan favorite of mine) and the eggplant carpaccio. There was nothing left to the eggplant plate, it was that incredible. It was chopped into such fine pieces so it made it easy to end up being a great topping to the pita. Next was the octopus which was cooked to perfection. Very tender and the flavors were delicious. For the main course, we did the vegetable couscous which was good, but not something I would order again. We more wanted the vegetables, so it fit for what we were looking for but wouldn't recommend using this as your main course. The Moroccan fish on the other hand...just WOW. Such a different and incredible dish! I o the point where we looked around at the bar and there were 3 people sitting next to us, all having the fish dish. If that doesn't speak for itself, I don't know what does! It is baked with a bread dome over it that you need to cut open to get to the fish. Such a unique concept which I think adds an extra interesting concept to the meal.Prices were good. Ambience was a great NYC vibe (somewhat unique to UWS). Food was out of this world. Book a reservation here ASAP!"

I loved the eggplant carpaccio, which had such a rich depth of flavor and their taboon bread was so light and airy and went so well with it. Octopus was nicely cooked as well. I think my favorite thing might have been the dessert though-- I got the Nemesis (chocolate mousse) which may honestly have been the best chocolate mousse I've had in my life, it's literally sheer indulgence. The Malabi looked really good too; I'll have to try it when I come back!"

Definitely gives off an intimate date night vibe. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The food is the real star here. The best dish we ordered was the 700 Degree Cabbage. So savory and soft. The Taboon bread and tzatziki was also phenomenal. The bread is pillowy soft and a little salty, while the tzatziki is creamy and full of flavorful herbs. Our table also enjoyed the octopus which was perfectly seasoned, and the perfect texture. The only dish that was a little underwhelming was the Israeli salad. Still good, but not out of this world like the other dishes. I would highly recommend stopping in here for dinner!"

Had carrot special both times which seems to be roasted in a wood fire oven.  Delicious and you can really taste all the components.  I had chicken musakhan and my husband had kebab halabi.  Full of flavor and just the right amount of spice.  For dessert, we had baked mousse which was also outstanding.  It came with cookie crumbles which I tasted separate from the mousse and even the cookie crumbles were amazing.  This place really is top notch both times we visited.  I highly recommend."

First off let me say the staff terrible everyone is on their phones or too busy gossiping instead of working. Second from the way everyone was talking I couldn't even tell who was the manager on duty to put order to the  Chaos between long lines and waits, no one bagging food and no one in the back actually preparing food but rather hiding from customers talking about where they are going on vacation. Now...as far as the food quality it is either burnt and thrown together with no reguard or stale because it's been sitting there without being bagged not to mention people getting wrong orders mixed in with there food. Lastly and this is the comical part of it all is the free food Being handed out to friends and family members. This location is in a major need of a face lift in employment and management."

The manager and I believe the owner are verbally abusive to their staff on multiple occasions. In turn the staff are disrespectful to each other and the customers.

1367,hmG5OnHEe2vQRrQxez0U9w,2/4/2023,5 star rating,"First of all... how is it that zero -- ZERO -- of the preceding reviews for Worthwild mention the shaved elk heart in the Vieuxdeux cocktail? Our server convincingly said that other diners regularly order it. Either I've been misled, or other Yelpers are slackin'.Also, yes, that's elk heart... like, from the hooved mammal. At first, I assumed it might be the brand of a new liqueuer. Nope. Turns out, it does exactly what it says on the tin: it's a shaved, dehydrated, blood-pumping organ. We even got to take a look at the mother slab  -- it wasn't entirely appetizing, however, my cocktail was delightful. And the flavor? I'd describe is as ""essence of jerky,"" a mere hint of meaty umami.I'm not sure how we've slept on this joint for years, considering how frequently we dine out. The dishes were lovely, the cocktails were inspired, and the service was superb. Special hat tip to our server (Delia, according to the tab) for being warm, friendly, and just the perfect touch of social: engaging, but not overbearing. Also, I especially appreciate when servers have genuine recommendations rather than bland, ""whatever you want,"" when prompted for advice.Beyond the unorthodox cocktail garnish, the other dishes we sampled also left me slavering and contemplating whether or not to lick their serving vessels. We tried the shrimp and pork belly starters, the lamb sirloin main with a side of fingerlings, and a gorgonzola cheesecake for dessert. If you order the potatoes, be sure to dig around toward the bottom -- I'm not sure why they hide the good stuff, but all the savory, delightful tahini sauce was buried beneath the crisped starchy spuds.We don't often return to a place we've dined before unless it really stands out; the rich variety of exceptional eatery options in Manhattan is simply too robust. Worthwild makes it onto our short list for a reprise, amongst the likes of Upstate, the Hawksmoor, and Minetta Tavern."

The lemon ricotta pancakes were also fantastic with a slight tartness and not overly sweet.

I would say the only thing that I struggled with was the service. It seemed almost difficult to ask for minor modifications like adding an egg to the burger or bacon. The waitress had to ask the chef if it was possible which seemed a bit off to me. I would have just preferred if the menu stated no modifications were allowed instead of going back and forth. However, the food was great and the ambiance was relaxed so I'd give them another chance."

Also last time they had quite an extensive menu with many options and the prices are reasonable this was during the summer of 2020. My recent visit completely changed my view the brunch menu that used to be about 15 items was about five the prices are in the high 20s and there's limited selection. The staff although was friendly did come to the table about nine times and told us that they were closing the kitchen at 3 and it was 2pm. I felt very rushed by the wait staff and I didn't feel that the food was adequate to the price in which was paid. I would've thought they were had some type of deal to get people in there or a wider selection of menu items as the place was not packed to begin with. I was very disappointed with my experience be honest and I probably will not come back to this location. Go to spot for brunch date now has been taken off the list and there's minimal options for one to enjoy."

The shrimp was fresh and nicely coated, but it wasn't seasoned. The salad was fresh and well made, which surprised me based on the store's appearance. Rice didn't have much flavor.

The swivel chairs are shaky and damaged and the floors are dirty.  The prices have recently gone up on everything but the service is the same! I wouldn't bring my family to this place. Too many homeless and druggies hanging out. The only reason I gave it 1 star is bcas I seldom go in there to buy water.

I called recently, thinking it would make things a bit easier, but even then, I was put on hold for ten minutes, just to place and order. I end up hanging up the phone or walking out before even getting my food... nearly every time. Pass."

Located under the above-ground subway where they serve everything from breakfast sandwiches to fried chicken. The staff seems friendly and responsible. There is seating at the counter, but that's about it. Out of all the restaurants around here, Kennedy Fried Chicken is probably one of the better stores in this neighborhood of Highland Park. I ordered rice, salad with a shrimp basket (21 pieces), and a soda off of DoorDash. I went and picked it up. Food was ready when I went. The shrimp was fresh and nicely coated, but it wasn't seasoned. The salad was fresh and well made, which surprised me based on the store's appearance. Rice didn't have much flavor. I thought it would be seasoned like halal dishes, but it wasn't. Was I satisfied after the meal? Yes, I was. Would I explore the other options on the menu? Why not?"

Blue Bottle was right across the street, so it was a convenient pit-stop before heading to our next destination. This location is on the ground floor of the 4 WTC skyscraper, near the corner of Greenwich Street and Cortlandt Way. It's not a terribly big cafe, but the high ceilings and tall glass windows made it feel more airy. Seating is mostly high stools with bar height tables, with a few low tables. It's a very simple menu, which is great for those who are a bit indecisive. They have drip coffee, iced coffee, espressos, and other non-coffee drinks. Plenty of dairy alternatives to choose from. Food options are slim. I went with New Orleans, which is iced coffee. The chicory gave it a well rounded roasted flavor, and the cane sugar provided some sweetness. Compared to the ones I've had on the West Coast, this one was a little less creamy and had more bitterness to it.

The minimalist designed store is very bright due to the large windows letting in all the sunshine.  I saw NOLA coffee on the menu, which I've never had. NOLA-style coffee is French roast beans with roasted chicory root, an herbaceous plant that's part of the dandelion family. We order a Hot NOLA and a hot spiced NOLA. Both were terrific, however we loved the bolder flavour of the spiced NOLA. If you've never had one before, it's like a latte. We also ordered a selection of their sweets which included a lemon poppyseed loaf, brownie and cookie. Everything was fresh and delicious. Overall, highly recommend."

Ordered from the menu and the guy overcharged every item by .50¢... then when I asked why every item is up charged he said it's tax... (but the tax is a separate charge altogether in addition to but clearly he couldn't think fast enough on his feet to have a proper lie.) So if you don't pay attention, they'll nickel and dime you.  Also, the food is not good and they cheap out on stuff. For example I ordered carne asada and got a whole plate with fries and barely any steak or toppings. I ordered a tostada and it barely had any chicken in it. Then the guy is haggling me over sauce! Lol sauce!... good way to lose business, and for what??  Over sauce and cheating ppl by overcharging. You gain a little today but you lose so much later. Bad business. I'll never patronize this petty place again. Plenty of other places on the island that will appreciate your business."

The elote, on the other hand, was incredibly delicious! I highly recommend trying the elote if you have time; I promise you won't regret it! (:Thank you for reading and good luck! (:"

You might think that you just walked into a community dining hall. We came in on a Friday late afternoon, and everyone inside seemed to know everyone. Folks speaking loudly and warmly to one another.Then, you look around. You will spot a booth, sectioned off and the bling'd letters of VIB on it. Alright. La Rola clearly wants a piece of the nightlife activities in the area.Like many Dominican eateries, they do the ""comedor"" style, where they have premade staple food that is similar to buffet but without the self serving. You would ask verbally what they have for the day and then make your choices. Usually involves a protein, and then followed by sides. Maybe it be rice and beans, green or yellow plantains, spaghetti. Add a side of plain salad or not. They also have regular menu items that can be made to order, but I was aiming for quick bites also... you can't go wrong with the dishes of the day when that is exactly what everyone in there were having. I ordered the guisado (stewed beef) with white rice and kidney beans. And washed it all down with tamarind juice. The food is appropriately seasoned, it hits the right notes of what I'm familiar with.I don't know why this place is marked as Mexican. It is not. Personally, I'm not a fan of the decor. The staff are nice and laid back, La Rola seems to be a place for the locals; I wouldn't be surprised if this places might come across as intimidating to some.

Twice they failed to place all purchased items in the bag and calling them regarding the items is a terror. You would think you are calling for free food! The responses I have received, ""Well! I did not take your order"" or ""call back during the time you placed your order"" or, the music is too loud that when you do call back 2 & 3 times, they pick up the phone and do not speak because THEY CAN'T HEAR YOU!. When the food arrives to your home, check to see that everything you ordered is in the bag and have the delivery guy call them. And don't do like me - I feel bad, because it's 8:30 pm, raining and or to cold to have the delivery person return. The person on the other end of the phone at the restaurant, wont care and will having you calling them for days for the missing food you paid for and did not receive."

I went inside the store to see if they could help me resolve it. The lady very rudely told me it wasn't her problem and said ""ain't nothing i can do about it."" Wonderful Grammar skills, right?I spoke with the manager as well, who said i would have to talk to customer service team on the app. I said okay, could I please just have the order then?While waiting for the order, 5 people placed orders after me, including a door dash guy who appeared to be of Chinese descent. He asked me if I were waiting for my order, and I said yes. While waiting for the door dash order, he decided he wanted to place an order for himself and went to the register (the other 4 had finished their orders). The lady proceeded to yell at him to back up cuz of covid and social distancing.  Um, what? She didn't yell at anyone else. He asked for a 6 piece nugget, and she screamed demeaningly at him they don't gave it. The cashier could have just told him the 10 piece was $1.99. She didn't.  Every question he asked she screamed at him to back up. I was feeling really uncomfortable. He was then able to place his order, and also pick up the door dash order. The lady screamed at him again not to touch it even though a different employee was handing it to him since he was the door dasher assigned to it. Super uncomfortable.  I felt sorry for the guy.I also started to get annoyed at this point. I placed my order via app 5 mins before arriving at the restaurant, and had been waiting 20 mins at that point. I asked the cashier, she ignored me. I then asked for the manager. She said they were working on it. It took another 10 mins for my order to arrive. No straws, no napkins, no ketchup. At that point all other customers had left as they all received their orders, so no one left except me and my husband who came in to see what was taking so long! I tried to talk to the cashier for the missing items. She literally walked away and started playing with a notebook at the prep table. Seriously? I had to scream for the ketchup and she wouldn't give me straws or napkins. This is completely unacceptable behavior. Is this how they treat people of Asian descent? This store needs training since they should never treat people like this. NEVER going back and if you're Asian, steer clear of this location!!!"

Their menu consists of savory crepes, sweet crepes, salads, grain bowls, fresh juices, wellness shots, fruit smoothies, boosters, teas, soups, ice creams and so much more. The items are definitely fresh and made to order. After roaming around town or if you're getting ready to begin your day, this is an absolutely great stop. The service is excellent and the taste is exactly what you'd expect from good quality. Glad to have visited this location and looking forward to returning."

I came here after a dentist appointment and ordered the Gold Coast smoothie, and the bed stuy salad. Vegan style. I only had to wait about 10 min for my order and was able to sit outside to enjoy my meal. The juice was great, you have the option of adding turmeric but I stuck with the fruit. The salad was well balanced with all the veggies cooked without being mushy. The greens were thoroughly washed and enough was provided for each bite. If you're looking for something light and veggie/vegan friendly, this is a great spot."

I paid using my debit card because it is contactless. one can also tap to pay or use apple pay google or samsung. i am definitely intrigued by the grain bowls named bed stuy gowanus and fort greene.

I was craving crepes and was so excited to try this but was left disappointed and still craving.Maybe it's because I ordered from Williamsburg and Park Slope is a ways away, but my food was no longer warm and was pretty soggy by the time it got to me. I also did not like the onions. I don't know if I'm just weird or have a different way of making caramelized onions but the ones in the crepe did not taste caramelized and kind of ruined it for me (on top of the sogginess). The salmon and goat cheese were top notch though!I will say, I mixed the hot chocolate with coffee and that was delicious!Maybe I'll have to try it in person instead of through delivery but I just had to express my disappointment because I was really looking forward to this and spending $20 (+fees) just to end up still hungry kind of sucks."

By this point, I've tried most things on their menu and can say that they excel at consistency. Every crepe that I've had has felt indulgent and delicious, and  all of the juices, smoothies, and salads have been incredibly fresh and filling. I'm personally a sucker for the chicken pot pie soup in the dead of winter. Prices are definitely reasonable for the neighborhood and are on par with most fast casual chain dining spots. As far as I know, Bklyn Crepe is a small business with only one location, making your stop all the more worthwhile. Beyond the great food, the staff is extremely friendly and makes a great effort to serve customers quickly with attention to detail. Every time I've gone in I've been asked about allergies and food intolerances, and have never had an issue with cross-contamination. Definitely give this spot a try if you're looking for something fast and delicious!"

The broth doesn't have as much depth as I would like, however the quantity of meat makes up for it--great meat to pho ratio. The spring rolls are definitely on the smaller side and the flavor can get lost if you wrap it with too much lettuce. However, the flavor is definitely there (use less lettuce that you normally would) and the crunch of these spring rolls are second to none (although they are a tad bit more oily). The service during the meal was great as well. The food came out quickly and the staff is very attentive--they refilled our tea ~6x on their own. The only strange part is that the staff member took a look at the tip amount I put down and asked me to change it the amount that was suggested on the receipt. I always calculate 18% of the subtotal on my own and then add it to the final amount. However the restaurant's tip calculation is based off the amount after the tax and after the credit card usage fee, which does not make sense to me. However, their service was very nice so I didn't have a problem making that change, but it was still a bit strange nonetheless. Overall I will still be coming here whenever I want large quantities of meat with my pho."

I was disappointed the first time around and decided not to come here again. My uncle and his family came last year, and they were not pleased. There's a modern look to this place that appeals to some. It's not like Pho Bang or Pho Bac, which is authentic but looks like a hole in the wall. If you are looking for authentic Vietnamese dishes, Pho Best is not it. Pho Best is quite Chinese actually. The menu is translated into Chinese, as well. Recently, my aunt took us here. I have to admit, it is not bad. The staff is accommodating and tries to get the orders out as fast as possible, but not in the correct order. For example, my cousin ordered filet mignon cubes with rice, and her order came out before our Vietnamese Crispy spring rolls (appetizer). The pho was good in terms of the broth and noodles. However, when it came to the beef cuts, it was still the same issue that I was annoyed by a few years earlier. The beef slices were cut with the beef fat (yellow clog of fat) still hanging. Why can't they remove the beef fat? It's not tasty. It's unappealing. The grilled chicken pho was delicious. The chicken was well cooked, juicy, and all around delicious. Even though the spring rolls were smaller than normal, and my cousin found a bug on their lettuce, I still found the spring rolls tasty. When my cousin informed them about the bug, they took it back and washed the lettuce. Overall, it has improved. Would I come here again? Maybe, but it wouldn't be my first choice for Vietnamese food in the area."

It was quite clear that this place is not authentic Vietnamese but rather run by Chinese people based on the language the staff spoke, the writing on the menu, and the taste of the dishes that came out. We ordered spring rolls to share, which were much smaller than I expected for the price here quite flavorless. They also came out after the pho did, which seemed a bit odd given they were an appetizer. I got the three color sweet beans drinks, which ended up being mostly just ice with a bit of other flavors. For my main dish, I got the beef brisket pho, which was pretty subpar compared to most other pho I've had.  The broth was quite flavorless and also not particularly hot when it came out.  The meat was too tough; I realized I should have probably ordered the rib eye which my friend got since it was more tender. When we finished eating, we asked for 3 to-go containers since all three of us had quite a bit of leftover broth and noodles. The waitress kept trying to only offer us 2 containers and tried telling us to combine them, which is not only kinda gross but wouldn't work if we wanted to keep them separately. Eventually when my friend told her in Mandarin that we needed 3 containers she brought out 2 large containers and a smaller container, which the smallest leftover portion fit almost perfectly inside, so I don't know why she tried arguing us for a couple minutes over it.Next, she came out with the check and asked how much we wanted to tip which I've never seen happen at a restaurant before. She then took the credit card and went to go charge it and came back with a receipt that had the tip included but still had another area for additional tip, which I thought was just confusing and actually a bit rude.Overall, I'd say DON'T COME HERE!"

The place is relatively big with lots of tables. Given that it was summer in New York, and extremely hot, we decided to opt for a ""colder"" dish. We got BBQ Pork with rice vermicelli and spring roll & pork chop with rice vermicelli.Both were delicious and the portions were large. I would recommend the bbq pork if you're looking for leaner meat and the pork chop if you wanted a little more fat (both meats were seasoned the same). The spring rolls in the rice vermicelli caught me by surprise because I was expecting them to be the meat ones that were double deep fried (appetizer style), but this one had more of a light ""birds nest"" crusting with less meat inside. Not quite the same, but if you were looking for the double deep fried spring rolls those aren't it. Still delicious though!"

We ended up waiting for a party to leave ourselves in order to get seats and ordered pretty quickly. The atmosphere is very loud and the crowd was visually very young - mainly young professionals from the look of it. We had to scream in order to be heard from the other side of the table, but overall I think that the ambiance fits the vibe pretty well. I only tried their frozen drinks here and preferred the frosé to the piña colada. The latter was very heavy on the coconut flavor and was more icy for some reason while the frosé tasted a lot like rosé and was a little more melty / liquid. Either way, for $10 both drinks were pretty good. If you're looking for a place to visit for a bar crawl around the area, I think Botanica is a good spot to stop by. I can imagine it gets a lot busier as the night goes on though so maybe stop by earlier if you'd like a place to sit!"

1524,IFQ1CXX3QTiuOjeXYvtWLw,1/3/2023,3 star rating,"I'm going to keep this review short and to the point. One word: disappointing!In NYC for the Giants vs Eagles game pre-Christmas. The city is packed and I was looking for a good steakhouse on Saturday night near (walking distance) our hotel. A friend once (several years prior) recommended this place. When we arrived with reservations, the host and hostess acted as if we did not have reservations and they were going to see if they could accommodate us. After a short wait we were brought up a flight of stairs to a table for two. I understand I may be larger than the average bear, but my waist was wider than the table. At a steak house typically everything is ala carte, as it was here which was fine. But you couldn't fit two drinks and two main plates on the table without things almost sitting on top of each other. Much less, two steaks, two sides, sauces, bread, and a bottle of wine... the server was fine but disappeared for extended periods of time. Especially when you wanted a glass of wine, as the bottle couldn't fit on the table, so she held it at the wait station about 10 yards from our table. I grew up in NYC and I am used to loud noisy places, but the acoustics and noise level was over the top here. The food, mediocre at best. My steak was prepared to the proper temperature. But my Wife's filet was over done and the hollandaise sauce was very watery. The au gratin potatoes, although soupy too were ok, a little underdone. The garlic broccoli was the best thing we had. No complaints there. Oh by the way, the menu online is not the same. Very limited, and when we asked the server about some items (like a NY Strip), she said ""that's at the downtown location not here"" 3 stars??? Probably 2 and a half....Maybe the ""downtown location"" is better. But I would not waste your money or time at the theater district location."

No, not everything. He didn't get our orders right, or he forgot. We had to ask another waiter to get him to come back.As for the food. Maybe the steak was good....but forget about ordering a baked potato. First, the waiter didn't bring it and had to be reminded. It tasted like it was cooked, frozen, then reheated. As for the wedge salad. Good grief, can't they get fresh produce?This place may look elegant, but the service is very poor, the prices outrageous, the food so-so. For what we paid, we expected somethiing to make us sing ""Food, glorious food..."" Alas, the experience was a major disappointment."

We actually enjoyed the a la carte sides of Lobster Mac & Cheese & Garlic Mashed Potatoes more than the entree.  We stated afterwards we would have been happier having only our Martinis and our appetizer of Fried Calamari & Jalapeños.

1532,IFQ1CXX3QTiuOjeXYvtWLw,12/18/2021,3 star rating,"History of Present Indulgence: Big guys night with coworkers and friends to have some laughs over steak, cocktails, wine. We have this annual tradition to get together and try new steakhouses, and this time landed on Frankie & Johnnie's, a NYC classic. Physical Exam: Taste - In our table of about 15, we each ordered our own steaks and shared a bunch of appetizers and sides across the table. 2 of the guys and I on my end split a porterhouse for 3 cooked to medium rare under the USDA Dry-Aged Prime Steaks menu. It was good, but not the best. First few bites, selecting the really nice and pink center slices, were tasty. Nothing beats the feeling of when that first bite of steak hits the taste buds. But the flavor didn't last. There wasn't depth as I would have expected from a dry-aged steak. Additionally, the edges of the steak were cooked to a well done, and there was a spectrum of medium rare to medium well slices in between; absolutely not an even temperature spread across the cut. For appetizers, we shared a few dozen Blue Point Oysters, which were excellent. Would recommend passing on the Smoked Applewood Bacon Steak. Giant chunks of pork meat drenched in smoky, sweet aroma and flavor, but tough, and chewy. Chunks were also unevenly cut, leaving some that were just full globs of fat, while others only lean meat. Service - Great service! Very attentive, constantly coming to check on us and weren't annoyed by the largest, loudest group in the dining room. We were all very pleased with the staff. Atmosphere - Classic steakhouse atmosphere, but dressed from wall to wall of movie and theater posters, signifying their position as a pre-/post-theater go to in the neighborhood. Brightly lit, great for family dinners, dates, business meals. We clearly stuck out with our giant horde with multiple tables pushed together. In my opinion, just missing the lacquered wood and deep, dark colorings I find cozy about other steakhouses. Assessment/Plan:Frankie & Johnnie's boasts a quality location, convenient for anyone looking to experience a NYC steakhouse while still being near the Theater District. While the food was good, it's one of the few steakhouses where I left meat on the table, and my friends agreed about their individual orders too. For the price point, there are several NYC steakhouses that offer a much better experience. If you're looking for a steakhouse that shines in quality, taste, history, classic atmosphere, I probably would look at a few other places. If you're in the area with limited time, and money isn't an issue, this could be a good option. If you're able to shop around, maybe do a little Googling first."

""I have soda here on counter, driver forgot to pick it up."" and 2. ""You're so far from us that's why and it's going to take a very long time for him to go back to you."" So the soda was on the counter and you let your delivery guy walk off without it? And then on top of that you're telling me I'm too far? Their restaurant is on 41st street and I'm on 15th street. I am quite literally 10 minutes by bike and 6 minutes by car according to Google maps. They just didn't want to send it to me and it was obvious of that when they processed the refund after telling me that I would have to wait for my soda. Then when I noticed the dumplings and sauce that looked like it'd been on a rollercoaster I called grubhub, but because they use their own delivery drivers and can refuse to provide refunds I was only able to get a discount code for my next order.

The guy who takes orders over the phone is a lil' short, but living in this city for years you get what you get sometimes, but I don't do well trying to locate a delivery guy in the rain, who gets hot because his tip isn't up to his standards. In fairness the orders come quick, but having to draw folks a map after becoming a regular customer with a mouthy delivery guy, that don't get you a bigger tip."
1543,-WHFEUqFUr7xhEKTq5DIww,10/12/2015,5 star rating,I've been frequenting this spot for a little over a year now. Typical Chinese fast food. Nothing new but always tasty. (Are you still looking for General Tso?)The husband and wife combo are very friendly. I also like that they employ all sorts of locals for delivery. I was there when young fella came in and was told to get a bike and the job would be his.

However, some parts of the rice were overcooked and mushy. Chicken was fine. I also ordered the veggie spring roll and it was yummy. Easy location on Broadway, steps from Flushing Ave metro."

The boneless spare ribs were tender and sauced well. Fried rice has a fresh fried egg in it. Garlic sauce had deep flavor and didn't separate weirdly. Will be my go to spot for now.

1553,oIWsfYqrlCQ-1brns6VNjQ,10/23/2022,4 star rating,"A friend brought me here to shoot some pool on a Saturday night. Rates are exceptional; $7.12/person/hr for 2 and $5.90/person/hr for 3. Their service is fair for the amount of people that work there vs. the amount of tables they have to service. They have a separate bar with many drink options, but the cocktails are expensive ($15). We didn't try the food but it's cool that they have noodles and the kitchen is open until 11:30PM. When we came back the second time that night, the person at the register was negligent when closing the tab (seemed like the owner) and gave me back the wrong change. He apologized when I corrected him, but the earlier staff were more attentive. Clocks are accurate and match when you get the table. I agree with other reviews, there can be some shady people here, but for the hours I spent there it looked like everyone was minding their own business. The place was packed at 10PM: the pool tables, the card tables, etc. Our table didn't come with a rack but one of the employees quickly gave us an one when we asked."
1554,oIWsfYqrlCQ-1brns6VNjQ,1/14/2020,4 star rating,"I played billiards here today in the afternoon. The place was nice and spacious, and the atmosphere was very soothing and relaxing. They charge for an hour and after an hour by minutes, so you do not need to stay for another full hour if you do not want to. Playing for a little more than an hour only came to about $10 dollars. I had a good time and the facility was in good condition."
1555,oIWsfYqrlCQ-1brns6VNjQ,7/24/2022,1 star rating,"This place is not safe for women.. Came here with two of my girlfriends and we were basically followed around the place. 99% of the place is filled with older men who stare you down with no shame. Some men next to us at the bar got up and propped themselves up next to the wall near the pool table and we were playing at and just watched and sipped their drinks. One of them even followed me to the bar a second time and watched me from a distance at the other end of the bar. We were just so uncomfortable we weren't even there for a full hour before we had to leave. The whole place is just sketchy, older men hanging out outside of the bar till after midnight and the area it's located in isn't too great either."
1556,oIWsfYqrlCQ-1brns6VNjQ,2/10/2019,4 star rating,"The only problem is that there are zero girls whatsoever. JD Salinger said it best: ""I like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once in a while, even if they're only scratching their arms or blowing their noses or even just giggling or something.""Anyway, the rates here are even cheaper than they are at fat cat. This place still isn't as good in my opinion because it doesn't have wifi, nor the charming atmosphere. However, it is way bigger, and according to my friends, the tables are a little different (this doesn't mean better, just different). I don't know exactly if they serve food here, but it looks like you can get beer here? idk, i didn't order anything.I've never been here at night, so I can't comment how it is then- however during the afternoons, this place is not too busy. As I alluded to, mostly guys come here. Most of the time it's middle aged guys, but some young ones come as well. I believe they have ping pong in the back, though I've never gone to go properly look. This place is probably a 15 minute walk from the 7 train, and while you can take a bus to get closer, none of the buses exactly go near it, so you're gonna have to walk some length of the distance. Still, if you want to save money, and have business in flushing as it is, this can be a great place to go practice and have a chill hang out with friends."
1557,oIWsfYqrlCQ-1brns6VNjQ,12/28/2020,3 star rating,"A decent pool hall. During the pandemic no alcohol is served and every other pool table is not is use. However, that is not true for the 3 cushion billiards and snooker tables which are all open for use. Masks are required but saw several players without a mask so obviously this rule is not enforced. The neighborhood is so-so. Wouldn't want to walk around this area late at night. Place seems a bit run down and outdated with several tables which had stain marks on the cloth. A renovation would definitely make the atmosphere nicer and more upscale. But many pool halls are closed these days during the pandemic so if you're just looking to play pool, this place will do."
1558,oIWsfYqrlCQ-1brns6VNjQ,12/24/2019,5 star rating,Cmon people. This is one of the last pool relics of the neighborhood. Show it some love. The pool tables are well maintained and the prices are cheap. Wish the pool sticks got updated. There are many pool tournament banners and trophies in the place. Tell me another place in NYC that has this much history. Bet you won't be able to tell me many.

They're always friendly and after we finish playing we sit and relax. Yes, its run down yes, its old but its a chill place to talk, drink decent beer and play some pool or carom. Definitely recommend."
1560,oIWsfYqrlCQ-1brns6VNjQ,1/2/2019,4 star rating,"Came here with my uncle to play pool first time ever in my life. The smell of smoke was present when I entered even though it says no smoking everywhere. The tables looked really clean and there were a lot of players everywhere. I didnt even know there was music playing until the end , it wasn't loud. The music was Keke do you love me by Drake so that was dope..90 percent of the players were men in their 50s. 7 percent were like college kids and 3 percent female. Reminds me of when I go to the golf driving range. Playing was a lot harder than I thought. My shoulders , back and neck was kinda achy just after playing just one hour. It took me 45 minutes just to learn to hit the ball without moving the stick upwards or hitting it too weak. Time went by so fast. I was nervous because I dragged pushed the stick forward on the table like twice and if it ripped that would not be good. But it was a fun experience, 12 bucks is good price I feel but I prefer bowling. My advice for people like me that are coming here for first time or new players is to practice the hand and arm positioning and knee bending a lot before coming here and watch videos online youtube. That way you will have more time to play and not spend most of it learning like me.Overall it was a good experience and apparently according to the guy at the front, this place hosts the World Championship of Pool so that was cool to hear."
1561,oIWsfYqrlCQ-1brns6VNjQ,11/2/2015,4 star rating,"This is a great place to play ping pong.Lots of available ping pong tables: 6 STIGA expert tables. Lots of spaces to move when playing ping pong. Cheap rates if you bring your own paddles. After spending a cumulative total of $100 or more you get $15 off next visit. I used to play pool at this place as well. Pool section looks like other pool places. However, the outside facade of the place looks sketchy and dark. Need to be a bit careful while getting there as the place is not that lit. There is a parking garage next to this place if you are planning on driving there. Overall, this is a great place to play ping pong at a cheap rate."

We were the only group there, but decided to shoot pool after.  There are some out dated tables but for the most part, they're all new and in good condition.For the atmosphere, I rather go to a better billiards spot with good music, and a cleaner atmosphere.  But for playing pingpong and pool for 3 hours it was about 60 dollars and the receipt gives us a discount for a future visit. Definitely cheaper than many other places. Also note that the front of the bar looks shady af, with the poker players.  It used to be all high school and college kids.  Now there are middle aged to old men playing some who knows what kind of high stakes poker."

Al entrar, el lugar aparece estar muy oscuro. Más luz alumbra y traería un mejor ambiente familiar. También al entrar al lado derecho hay una altar enorme de la virgen María. Sería bueno considerar poner algo más pequeño para usar ese lugar para  mesas y sillas adicionales. Lo que en verdad me incomoda de este lugar es que no hay profesionalismo. Los dueños aparecen ser buena gente, pero yo soy cliente por muchos años y vi desde cuando la señora estaba embarazada, luego nació su bebé y ese restaurante se convirtió en una guardería. Hubo ocasiones donde cargaba el bebe en el canguro mientras tomaba laOrden nuestra.No creo que su bebé que ahora es un niño pequeño debiera de estar en el restaurante todo el día. Los juguetes del niño están allí, la cuna del niño está allí en el restaurant, y el niño tiende a aburrirse y empieza a correr o gritar en el restaurant mientras los clientes comen. No es un lugar para tener a los niños de uno, sería mejor contratar a una niñera así para dar la mejor atención a los clientes y que el ambiente sea cómodo. La última vez que fuimos a este restaurant, la señora vino a tomar nuestra orden y el niño la acompañó queriendo ayudarle a tomar los menús y queriendo nuestra atención. Niños son niños, no es su culpa y creo que el lugar no es adecuado para el estar ahí todo el día. Aparte de eso, la comida está sabrosa por eso continuamos yendo a este lugar.

Mandato has the best chorizo hands down and that's a hill I'm willing to die on. They've never let me down. The block they're on has 2 other taquerias that are good as well but they don't compare to Mandato, who also has a grocery next door where you can buy their chorizo. Too many people don't know what TINGA is but they should because even though their grilled chicken is fire, their tinga is even better. Tostadas are bomb, everything is good, just go eat there."

Haven't been to a pizzeria for a minute..$4.50 for a slice, I guess. It was more in the thin crust level which is probably why I inhaled it, can you say gone in 60 seconds. Cute spot for quick bite.  If in the neighborhood check it out."

Their late(ish) night selection hits the spot when you're looking for a dietary-restrictive friendly slice of the New York classic.I'm usually not a huge fan of daiya cheese, but Two Boot's spin on veggie- and vegan protein-packed slices has me wanting seconds. The crust is solid, the sauce to topping ratio is solid, and the price is absolutely fair. On top of the solid slices, the Williamsburg location is cosy and has the same vibes as their other Manhattan locations. The eclectic wall designs are perfect for a kid's pizza party, or someone just seeking those throwback vibes.I would definitely recommend Two Boots as a solid pizza stop."

I got a grandma style pizza with garlic. My fiancé got the buffalo chicken and vegan pepperoni. The pizza was great, thin crust just how I like it. Three slices with tax were around $15"

It has taken great care of me on my hangover days from hell or when I simply couldn't be bothered to cook. It has also seen me through my vegan, gluten free and vegetarian phases of my life. I have no doubt it will have options for any other fad diet I decide to take on. Not only do they have a ridiculous variety of options, they can also custom make any pizza you want. Ordering with them is easy and seamless, it never takes me more than 2 minutes to put in my order and it's always delivered piping hot and on time. My personal favorites are the Mr Pink with their delicious Cajun chicken, the bird which is their take on the buffalo chicken, V for vegan and Larry Tate. The CBDB is also really good but can be pretty greasy. The cornmeal base's gritty texture compliments the melted cheese and toppings perfectly. I can go on and on but I suggest you check them out! And I hope you love them as much as I do."

I got the garlic knots they also have no taste. They gave me a container of tomato sauce and it's plain! Not even 1 seasoning. No wonder the pizza is so bad

Then 14th Street.. 86th Street..then Park Slope.. then Gowanus. Went from the best to the worst.Today after getting wasted at Tipsy Scoop on an empty stomach I realized I did it backwards thus walking back to Bedford Train station I saw Two Boots and decided I'll add a Driggs page to my Two Boots diary..I entered with not the best expectations but needed food to accompany the boozy ice cream.I decided on a regular slice and shocked to see $3.25 as the price.. in my hood it goes for $5. My slice was warming up and noticed the weekly special is a slice and soda for $4.. wow what a deal!I dined Al fresco ( Vanilla Bean Bourbon was coasting through the veins) and took my first bite with hesitation and.. it was East Village all over again! Yummmmnimnomnom! I went back inside to take pics of the cool interior and thanked the server. I told him how my slice exceeded my expectations and explained the last time I ate Two Boots was in Gowanus and it was awful! He smiled and said ""I used to work in the  Gowanus location"" Cue the embarrassment strings.. we both laughed and I took my tipsy touchas to the train station!Note: eat inside in the back, really cool vibe!"

1606,xWqvccWuks8uBPewRbQArw,10/14/2022,4 star rating,I came in off the street just seeing their lunch special; 2 cheese slices and a soda for $6.50. The slices were a good size about 1/4 of a pizza. The drink was a small. My slices were fresh out the oven so I got it to go and didn't eat them right away. The sauce needed more flavor but the rest was good. The service was fast and friendly. There is seating inside and in front.

The side of salad was fine. What a waste of $60+."

Their special deal is 2 cheese slices + a soda for $5.50, and that's probably the best pizza deal in the area.2. Otherwise, they differentiate themselves in this neighborhood with their deep dish slices for $4.25. I had a grilled chicken with peppers and it was good. Some slices look meh but most are fine. They even have one with penne pasta for all you carb-aholics! Or marathoners. You know which one you are. :)3. Cards accepted when spending $5+.Overall, I am still on a journey to try all the pizza places in this area but I do believe this is a good pizza spot for all you deep dish lovers."

Staples we order are Veal Parm Hero, chicken Finger w fries, sicilian slice, meat tortellini with vodka sauce. Those are favorites and honestly do not have any complaints about the quality or delivery.For us a solid choice in Brooklyn. If you stop by I believe they have a 2 slices and drink special for $5.00 not bad when some other pizzerias are charging $3 or more per slice."

I've called in a couple whole pizzas to-go at this point and it's always pretty quick (fitting with the name), and they ALWAYS send out a great pizza.The sauce is super unique and unlike any other I've found in the area so far - tons of flavor, definitely not an out-of-the-jar scenario. The crust is also really good, not too, too thin but not thick enough to take away from the rest of the pizza.The prices are good as well. Will definitely be back in the near future!"

1619,vmNpt3yV5PGCEOoOpmqwRQ,3/12/2012,4 star rating,"4.5 stars..Korn's is a kosher bakery with half a dozen locations only in the Hasidic communities of Brooklyn. They've been around since 1950 but are practically unknown to people who aren't Orthadox Jews. From my understanding is that all their products are baked in a single location (which is right next to this specific location) and sent to the other locations. As this large baking facility also packages products under other business names for wholesale there are always delivery trucks outside and the block smells amazing. Korn's itself is a modest store front with a lot of dessert options (and bread), they're cash only unless you're spending $10. Prices aren't listed so I thought it would be easy it hit ten bucks but it took a bag stuffed with half a dozen pastries to get me there. Everything I tried was fresh and great. It wasn't the ""best"" of anything but I was still pleased with everything I got (cheese danish, b&w cookie, apple turnover, and a couple other things)What brought me there was that I was looking for the best b&w cookie and a co-worker had mentioned them. They have small and large ones as well as pink & whites. Both sides of the frosting were amazing. The cake part was very thick with crispy edges and a soft interior. It wasn't as moist as one's I've had elsewhere (Juniors, Ess-A-Bagel, Barney Greengrass, Crumbs) but it was still good. I know some people like a slightly dryer cookie with slightly crispy edges so I can see how this might be someone's favorite, for me it was a 3rd best contender."

1641,XQ6hGg_xgkKyK293lBdF1w,9/6/2022,3 star rating,"I'll start off by saying that the food here is good. And this restaurant is also one of the MANY Latin restaurants that are on seemingly every other block in Washington Heights. So, if you don't end up eating here, I'm sure you'll be able to find another spot somewhere close and have food very comparable to what you'd find here. Started off with the roasted chicken and rice & beans. All serviceable. The chicken pieces were a bit small for my liking, but still pretty good. It's hard for any Latin restaurant to mess up rice, and thankfully this holds true for this spot. The difference is in how they make the beans. And the beans here are pretty solid. Their salad was plentiful but basic (corn, avocado, lettuce, tomatoes, beets). Their sweet plantains were good... but again, who in this neighborhood is gonna mess that up? The service on the other hand... well, that was lacking. At first, our waitress kept asking us what we wanted as if she was in a hurry to use the bathroom. We had told her we needed more time to check out the menu (my dinner companion needed extra time to figure out what possible other items she wanted). Once we ordered our food, our waitress disappeared. Nowhere to be found... ever again. Now, I'm not saying she needed to pull up a chair and wait for us to ask her for more water or another item off the menu, but it wasn't even busy. Like, can you come back for a second, please? We kinda need something... or am I going to have to get up and get you myself? (I got up and got her myself.)"

Prices are not as cheap as people seem to believe but maybe it's because they don't advertise all of them. Normally I get the same combo at other places and it's 5-8 $ cheaper but I was recommended to come here.Ps: beans were tasty but watery."

And i eat a lot of mofongo and am picky about levels of dryness. Loved how they packaged everything separately to avoid anything getting soggy. However what's with the attitudes?!?!?  Not sure if it was because I'm not a man or they made the sad assumption that I don't speak Spanish. But when I went in to pick up my order, I was ignored. Only after a man walks in 2 minutes later and a female went over to help him did another female decide to finally approach me and with an attitude as she asks me ""what you want?"" That's when i responded IN SPANISH that I was picking up my order I placed on the phone for the mofongo with chicken and cheese. She told me it was ready, walked away and grabbed it and stood by the register for me to follow. I'd give them 5 stars if only for the food and quick service (i called less than 10 minutes away).

We asked why their portions are so small and the lady said that's how they do it lol. this place is super stingy, stay away if your hungry. The food is decent here but not worth putting up with the rest when there are a million other Dominican restaurants in the area."

As I stood in the rain, the person in the store said:Did you pay?You don't have an order number andWe gave that order to somebody else because we didn't know your nameI showed them my email (with my name) and after talking to someone else they gave me free cupcakesI was disappointed on many levels"

They had a few cookie options available but I decided to go with the Raspberry Swirl Buttah Cookies. The cookies are beautifully packaged in sets of two and looked very appetizing. Now for the taste, the Raspberry Swirl cookies are delicious, sweet, sinful, moist and slightly crumbly but in the BEST way possible. Sincerely, I am upset that I did not grab another bag, haha!

The Cookies and Cream and the Chocolate Blackout cupcakes were good.  The Chocolate Blackout especially satisfied my chocolate needs and was better of the two cupcakes.  The chocolate chip cookie was super thin and crispy.  The way it is constructed there wasn't enough 'chip' in each bite for my taste buds and I'd personally skip this in the future.The shop is really small and there really isn't much seating.  The service has been really friendly and quick."

The musicians are so talented and are so great at creating an amazing atmosphere with their music.A few notes about the space. You can make a reservation and this is the best so you can get a table. If you don't make a reservation you can walk in and stand in the back and at the bar. There is no cover but you do need to buy two items per person and they include gratuity.Regardless of how the managers have chosen to operate the place, the music is great! You can get close to the musicians and they can see you as they play, which is great because you guys feed off one another! I went for a jazz and blues night and loved the band!They have pretty good food and a lot of drink options too! You can definitely come here for dinner or just a snack and drinks. Highly recommend!"

The ""manager"" came over to declare my friend and I HAD to purchase two drinks each which we would've ordered well over but his attitude and lack of professional customer care told us all we needed to know about this place. The fake manager then tried to dictate how we sat claiming it was mandatory one person sat on the bend and the other on the chair. What kind of place is this? The waitress was nice but seemed unsure of how to handle their dirty dish situation.If you're smart...never eat or drink here.They also charge $16 for HALF a shot.Never Again."

The drinks were about $14-$18. We didn't get food but they did have it. The performers were great and played a wide variety of songs in different genres. The bartenders were super helpful and quick as well. However it was so loud like almost unbearably loud and very crowded. Definitely to be expected at a music venue/bar but be warned if that is something you're sensitive to.

We got to Grove with an hour left until closing.  No charge at door. We heard band play 3 songs before they packed up. 1 Vodka(cheap) on the rocks1 vodka (cheap) and cranberry 1 Tito's Vodka and tonic1 tequila and Orange  All four drinks came in small glasses.Total cost= $77 (The bartender says ""just wanted to let you know, we already included gratuity"") with credit card slide asking for amount we wanted to tip. yes. $77 bucks for 4 small watered down drinks that the bartender automatically put his gratuity to with the Credit Card slider asking how much more we wanted to tip . Of course I did t add a tip.After that round of drinks I decided to take my three friends to the bar less than a Minute away with better sounding music coming from the speakers. I boughtTwo rounds of drinks for my friends, tipped the Bartender and Still paid less than the $77 I paid at Groove for 4 drinks.

I will never come here again and I'm sure they don't mind losing my business and that's ok.

This doesn't seem like the place I'd normally order an espresso martini, but it was actually decent!The selection of music here seems pretty diverse, and I love that. The person singing at the time had a killer set and it really lifted the day from being a good day to a great day. Service was standard. The main reason I'm giving them a 5 was just the overall ambience, it is a place I look forward to coming back to. A spot I imagine would be a good date!4.7/5"

After arriving they checked my ID and allowed me to enter. The space itself is small with a bar to the right and the main stage in the back. They've got three rows of tables for seating near the stage, as well as bar seating and a few high top tables to the left. This place was practically packed when I arrived and with the music playing, it was hard to hear any conversation you'd be having within the space. It seems like a fun spot tif you grab a table closer to the front, but besides that I'd try a less tiny venue for vining comfortably to live music."

This diner is very casual and you can tell the employees have a good relationship with the locals who frequent the establishment. To eat we had a :-shrimp quesadilla (not listed on the menu but we asked our waiter and he said he can make it happen :) it was a slight price increase but nothing insane). Unlike most places this quesadilla was piping hot, big and the shrimp were juicy! They were VERY generous with the shrimp. Highly recommend -Howard beach burger. It was okay. To me the burger resembled that of a frozen one but the bbq sauce and bacon did it justice. I also paired it with waffle fries which were tasty. -chicken quesadilla: PHENOMENAL. The chicken was juicy and seasoned well. This was my third time here and I'll definitely be coming back to do breakfast food. ***breakfast is served ALL DAY!"

But I was meeting some co-workers here for lunch and realized it is JOngro, which is not a Korean word I know. I think I like my version better because it would be an apt description of how they prepare their food. Although finding the right way in can be confusing because there are no signs telling you to take the elevator to the second floor.I went with their lunch special and got the kalbi/short rib (with co-workers so a little formal for my usual LA style) and cold noodle soup. With food prices going up, the lunch special is a pretty good deal! I douse the noodle soup in vinegar and mustard and the noodles and broth hold up well. The kalbi is tender and pretty flavorful although i could use a little more char and a little more flavor. For the lunch special, the meat is cooked in the kitchen so we miss out on the tabletop grilling but we also do not walk out with the BBQ smell on our clothes so perfect for a working lunch. There are probably only a couple of places where the BBQ is The decor is old school and the space is huge, and service was attentive. Definitely recommend this place if you are in the city."

Missing all the complimentary niblings that I am used to. I think there was ONE served. The meats were very good. The seafood pancake was very soggy. The seafood glass noodle were also soggy.

Heard this place gets busy but it was a weekday afternoon so we took a chance (no reservation) and luckily It worked out. None of us knew what we were in for! LolIt's definitely a place to enjoy with a group because you can order multiple items and it's more than enough to share.  For the meal We had the marinated chicken and the USDA prime kalbi steak. Both delish! We each had dipping sauces  and extras like marinated onions, salad, and more to complete our plates. Our server cooked our meats for us and idk if that's custom or because it was our first time but she did a great job. Definitely better than I would have done. Ok now I'm sure that must have been customary to prevent wasting/burning meat and fires.   I highly  recommend also adding a side from their special menu. Again, it's definitely enough to share. We tried the glass noodles with vegetables,  the deep fried dumpling, and the Spicy Octopus! All very  yummy, but the standout was the Spicy Octopus! While yes it was enough to share, that was the one dish nobody wanted to share because it was so amazing!  Yes I hear there are other Korean BBQ places around, I will definitely be going back to Jongro. This place was good to me and what's that saying.... You always remember your first!!!"

After about 10m I was told to order at the bar, fine. It took about 15 minutes to be spoken to and ordered a Guinness and came quick. Ordered loaded fries with cheese + sour cream on the side at around 7:15pm. By 7:50pm the fries finally had come out with the cheese + sour cream on top, so we asked to be re-done.While waiting for the 2nd order of fries, the employees just ate the wrong order of fries at the bar nonchalantly, very unconcerned with the fact it was taking over 1 hour to get some fries.While waiting for the fries we also ordered a burger and wings. At around 8:15pm, we still had NO burger, NO fries, NO wings. That's 90 minutes at the place and all we had received was 1 beer. We proceeded to ask to close the tab and they instead went to the kitchen and made us wait ~10m to close our tab. Then came out from the kitchen with the wings and the burger. Where are the fries though? I also had asked to close out the tab 10 minutes ago. Really? They held my card behind the bar. I asked to still close me out and I'd take the wings and I'll pay for it. They charged me for the Guiness + wings (really, after making me wait this long? but whatever). Server tried saying it was my choice to leave or stay when he brought out the burger and wings... what about the fries?All in all, I paid $23 for a beer and wings which is fine price wise. But I paid $23 while waiting almost 2 hours for the wings, fries and burger. No way I was going to sit down and eat the burger/wings there after waiting that long. It almost felt like they were holding those things as a dangling carrot since we were already there for so long... goodbye. Thanks for caring so much about our time + money to make us wait almost 2 hours for a simple thing and still just charging as if it was business as usual.The Edge Harlem (nearby) took us in and had a great time there.

There is only one person as the bartender + waitress, which is definitely not an ideal scenario. The drinks are watered down, and the food was meh (chicken chunks + seasoned fries). A food truck could've provided better food options. I definitely do not reccommend this place, spend your hard earn money elsewhere."

I saw a sign about new management and menu and decided to try my luck again, much to my disappointment. Ordered food to go from the bar and sat there for half an hour waiting for my food or some service. Didn't get asked about another drink or anything. Finally I get my stuff to leave because the wait was crazy, and all of a sudden the food is ready but had been sitting at the bar for who only knows how long. When I refused it, I had to hear the bartender, Abby, talking with her friends at the bar about how I was turning down perfectly good food and how they were gonna air fry it and heat it up for themselves. Abby also talked about how ""he"" referring to me could have still taken the food that hit been sitting there because it was still warm. I'll try again in a few months"

The staff had no idea I was hosting an event there, and therefore, were not prepared. The music drowned out our event, and they also had patrons interrupting on and off through the night. Some of the patrons also harassed us. When asking for a refund for the rental, they refused. Who does that to a widow doing an event to honor the work of her husband? They are VILE."

We have been 3 times - the first time we sat outside and one of the patrons told us you have absolutely no chance at service if you do that. Second time we were basically the only ones there and we still had to move to the table closest to the bar just to get some service, also the mint in my drink had seen better days. Third time was ""the best"" service we've had - maybe they're starting to read the reviews on here.BUT there is no question that the specials are fire. Our favorite is Thursday 50 cent wings and $5 frozen margaritas which are actually strong and good. Their food has been really really good every time we've gone. The hip hop that's usually blasting is a plus for me lol but that may be off putting to others. Easy after work spot for me and my husband to grab a cheap bite, deff not a spot we'd take people visiting or something."

That's usually referring to the appearance of the restaurant, which rarely plays a part in the experience and the food itself (based on my experience, anyway). Tiger Box is totally a hole in the wall. It's small, not fancy at all, not a bunch of hype and frills, but the experience....man, the experience. I arrived to be welcomed by the owner, Sy (spellcheck, please). She.is.phenomenal. We chatted for a bit before I ordered. There's no seating inside, so I went outside to sit and wait for my food. I had no idea what I was in store for. I tried several different dishes. The spicy pork bowl being one of them. Rice and pork, marinated in gochujang, ginger and other flavorful components, really got me in my feelings almost instantly. You taste the warmth, and the experience, and the love right away. I also tried the kimchi jjigae, which is a hot stew with kimchi, pork, onions, green onions, rice, and more. I'd say this was one of the most special dishes. The kimchi soaking in that stew, the tofu absorbing all of those flavors....ugh. Cooking is an art. This was cooking from a deeply rooted cultural background. The history was in every bite. I also tried the spicy pork ssam wraps, which were delightful. More of that yummy spicy pork, but with the freshness of the lettuce. Such a bright, Spring-y dish! The seafood scallion pancakes were one of my faves! Savory pancakes, packed with flavor, and seafood! I also tried the steamed meat kimchi mandu, which appear as dumplings, but owner Sy says, ""no, it's mandu"". And listen, I wasn't about to argue with her! She KNOWS, ok?! The mandu was divine. They were stuffed with kimchi and pork. After speaking with Sy, I have so much more of an appreciation for kimchi. She says the process is tedious, that it takes time. The more steps you add to your kimchi, the better it tastes. The more flavor you develop. She says it's a lot of work, but that she doesn't regret it. The kimchi is a top seller because it's served in so many dishes.Sy is special. She really does love running Tiger Box. That is inspiring and you can taste her love in the food. This is homestyle authentic Korean cuisine, and I am still blown away by it all. I cannot wait to get back! Please, please do yourself a favor and visit Tiger Box in Brooklyn."

I haven't been back since, but I will be returning to the area since school has started back up for me and intend to visit this place and update my review with their post-quarantine measures. To start off with, I absolutely fell in love with the food and the owner is the sweetest lady. She's very kind and made conversation with me before I headed out. I had chosen to dine in for a classic sundubu-jigae on a cold day in February. She cooks everything herself which is incredible. She takes good care to make sure your food is well prepared and hot when you get it. It's such a wonderfully homemade taste that I have been missing throughout the quarantine.Prior to the pandemic, it was a self ordering system. There were two tablets to order from, and a fridge nearby to grab your prepaid drink. There was one large communal table with seating along with a repurposed pellegrino box for utensils and napkins. Talk about environmentally conscious, we love that. There were also two chairs on the side, I assume for customers waiting for their to go orders. Anyway, I love the food from here, it's a little on the pricier side since it's all homemade dishes but I'm also a broke college student lol so keep that in mind. Eating from here is a treat, one that I miss and can't wait to return to. I highly, highly recommend!! I'm excited to stop by again soon and support this business."

While the location on Park is a little out there, I enjoy the walk for my pick up and they do have delivery. My review is only for pick up. My family swears by the seafood pancake/paijun. We order two pancakes for four of us, otherwise we will fight. They always have a lot of seafood in them (shrimp and octopus), scallions, and are undersalted so you can dip them liberally into the soy sauce. (We throw them into a frying pan to crisp back up when we get home for maximum tastiness, a toaster over works too!) We also love the japchae (sweet potato noodles) which are loaded with vegetables and beef and are sooo good. The bimbimbap is my summer entree go-to, as it's loaded with veggies and is a lighter, refreshing dish. Bimbimbap comes with go chu hang on the side so you can mix in as much spice as you like. Hubs likes the galbi bowl (beef short rib) over the kimchi fried rice. I also love the soon dou bou stew, but I prefer eating it in the winter since it's spicy and hot and soupy. I think the prices are fair for the quantity and quality. Usually when I order ahead, my food is ready to go at pick up. This last run they needed an extra 10 minutes.  During COVID, they're running a lean ship. For non COVID times, there is a very small dining room that can seat 6-8 people, which tells me you're better doing take out."

1711,-f3GB9AGUqLFkXorluMFTQ,3/12/2023,2 star rating,"I only write reviews when I'm either really impressed with a place or the opposite. Unfortunately, my initial great impression of this particular restaurant has been permanently tarnished and it is with a heavy heart that I have to update my review.I first came here about 3 years ago for an amazing lunch with my husband and son. I deeply support the initiative for grass roots, organic, farm to table approach and wanted to support this charming local place and the efforts they're putting in. That's why I decided to host my birthday party here for the first time since COVID, get my family together and wow them with what I thought would be a spectacular gourmet evening.The chef went over the menu for a family-style prix fixe in advance, and we agreed on 6 appetizers and 3 main courses plus 3 desserts, shared among 12 adults, and ordered some extra dishes for 4 kids.When we arrived, we saw that two tables have been set up for our party, with a huge draft coming from the outside aimed right at those tables, so most people had to keep their coats on. (They could have set us up at the other side of the restaurant with no draft, and connected the tables. However, the other side had a few small tables, most unoccupied or people coming and going.) No one greeted us upon arrival, and we kind of had to figure things out for ourselves. Half hour after we came, we were finally approached as two waiters started setting up plates, but still no one really spoke to us and were just on autopilot, not even a smile.The dishes started coming out, and we noticed they were not evenly distributed among our two tables. Not only that, there wasn't nearly enough food to feed the 12 adults from the portions allotted for our pricey prix fixe - though they were placed on large dishes and barely fit on our narrow tables. I felt super uncomfortable and apologetic to my guests, as we had to squeeze in to make the plates fit, and we kept passing scraps of leftover dishes from one table to another. We ordered a few more appetizers and dishes for the table that seemed to only get the scraps, and we asked the staff several times to split each dish that was coming out among the tables. They repeatedly still only brought one given dish to one table, so we had to pass it over. They finally carried out one of the extra appetizers, split among two dishes - and the result was pitiful. It was barely enough for one person to enjoy one forkful per dish - how was this meant to be shareable, let alone for 12 adults?Also, no drinks were included so we were charged for every single soft drink and tea/coffee, which other prix fixe usually include. The bathroom was tiny and we had to walk through the kitchen to get there, and that felt super awkward, especially with kids.Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed because of the lack of foresight and poor service. If the waiters or chef actually came out and asked what we need to be more comfortable, or at least gave us a few more dishes at no charge seeing how we kept directing them to make sure we have enough for both tables - I would have greatly appreciated that. Just a smile or acknowledgment would have gone a long way. Instead, I had the feeling that they thought we were being difficult, or like we had three heads when asking for some pretty common sense basics, such as to set us up with individual plates for the ""shared"" desserts. I do take responsibility for not having asked enough questions prior to reserving, and definitely paid the price tag for this lesson! The bill came out to way more that the prix fixe because of all the extra charges, and that money would have went a long way at pretty much any other restaurant, including upscale banquets. And I understand it's a small place but I did not expect them to take our reservation if they could not accommodate a larger party, especially since we told them in advance about the kids and infant we had in our party. Despite the high-quality food, this place ultimately left a bad place in my mouth. I spent more time stressing out about the guests being comfortable and fed, vs actually enjoying the cute decor with the ambient music and delicacies.Bottom line: this can be a good place for an intimate lunch or dinner for a couple, but is not equipped to handle larger groups. I personally will not be coming back."

Example: textbook foie gras lobe, perfect flavor combo, coffee added for unknown reason. Still worth ordering. Do order the borscht. Best I've ever had, and I do not say this lightly. Vegetarian is excellent, with meat is also excellent. Duck and scallops excellent. Textbook. There will be an unnecessary ingredient thrown in the mix to keep things from being too perfectly balanced. Still, overall forgivable. Be advised, there is a small corkage fee. I think around $10. Best bang for buck - next door there's a liquor store: buy a .7L jar of moonshine. I'm partial to the raspberry infusion."

Like pause I'll be right back- runs out the door and walks right in. This place is pure nostalgia. No it's not like the Rockaways not at all but it's a perfect little neighborhood bakery right on the corner on 3rd Ave. EVERYTHING smelled perfect and fresh and idk if they what country they were repping (Italian, Polish) idk but i ordered MAD stuff. The awesome older woman behind the counter seemed to be delighted. Mexican bread- 5/5 - sweet on the outside, soft on the insideOnion bread- Maybe it was focaccia idk but good any temp. Soft, savory. 5/5Cannolis- 5/5 i got mixed flavors and didn't share with anyone. Chocolate covered is my favs. Tiramisu- 5/5 i knew it was going to be bussin i just knew. Total damage like $21 and they take card I remember because I had a $20 bill and thought they would let me slide for the $1 but they were like no we take card lol.

The worker offered me a choice of apricot or raspberry filled almond marzipan cookie that I ordered.  I have not seen them in two flavors so this was a good indication!  Not!  The almond marzipan cookie tasted so stale it must have been a leftover from 1935.  It was wrapped in plastic wrap.  I thought the bakery was being thoughtful but no! Not even plastic cling wrap could keep this cookie from becoming hard and dry like camel dung!  I cut a teeny tiny piece.  The almond paste ring that sits on top of the cookie should be soft and chewy.  It tasted like sand in my mouth.  No almond taste only sugar. I had a tummy ache right after.  For sure this one's going straight to the garbage!  $4.95 is way to much to pay for dried up camel dung!  No wonder my initial instincts were right.  I should have fled.  The store has many pastries and cookies but all do not seemed to be touched!  Beware of bakeries that have tons of cookies and pastries that are perfectly filled to the brim.  When customers don't buy, you get stale stuff!  Beware of strangers on the street with bad taste buds and trust your own gut instinct!"

I couldn't stop laughing each time when I passed by the window. I eventually made this place a regular, especially for a little indulgence with coffees in the mornings of weekend. This greek pastry shop looks really old school and it reminded me where my mom brought me to when I was a kid. The ladies who run this shop are super nice and patient, they insisted boxing my cakes and stringing the box carefully just like what we usually had in old times for delicate pastry boxes for the holidays. It makes my each cake indulgence more like a festive ritual now. My favorite pieces here are the tres leches cake and the mini baba rum. The bottom layer of the tres leches cake tastes like ice cream and it does melt. The baba rum made of rum I assume and has the perfect alcohol flavor accompanied by creams."

I did buy them one time and they tasted a day or two old and trust me you want these fresh to get the amazingness of that Petit four. I find it hard to track down petit fours in general over nyc and in most places, so this place is like a hidden treasure for us. It's all take away fyi, so don't plan on eating here. But it's nyc, you can find a stoop anywhere and enjoy!The people in the store are really nice as well and willing to answer any questions you may have.

Maybe, it would be different for a custom cake but I'd be leery.I tried their cookies and I'd say they were old. It's one thing to be hard, or even crunchy but if they sit long enough things don't improve. There are sell by dates and use by dates and I don't have a lot of confidence in this bakery.

Reminded me of desserts from the fast food-esque bakeries inside Eastern European subway stations...countries that's pride themselves on pastry, so edible, but mcd's version. Main flavor was sugar and flat taste otherwise. Mushy. Specialty spinach and feta pastry featured at register seemed pretty fresh but so bland I wasn't sure at first I'd bit into the right item.

Not only are there cameras everywhere, the bar is also wired for sound, Michael sits in his apartment upstairs and creepily watches and listens to everything that goes on. Michael has been able to operate with impunity, despite the hundreds of instances of him harassing both staff and patrons. This man is dangerous and should not be able to profit off of his toxic and illegal behavior. Aside from being a predator, he is a racist bigot, a drug addict and drunk whose erratic rages have caused immeasurable harm to scores of people. Read the article in the Columbia Spectator from this past November, for further details about why you should not give this horrible, gross man any of your money. columbiaspectator.com/ne…This has gone on far, far too long, everyone who knows what I'm talking about, leave a review, let people know the truth about the scumbags who run this place!! Law enforcement should investigate and SHUT THIS BAR DOWN!!!!"

Kept walking over and bugging my friend (another girl) about not knowing his antiquated movie trivia or caring that he got a beer with Paul Newman or whatever. If you're a girl -- stay away if you don't want to be harrassed by a disgusting old man who's stuck in the 70s with no bearing on reality."
1735,ErMFay-6o83QB2P1k4ALAg,11/11/2018,3 star rating,We went there on a Friday night at 2am and the bar was still about almost packed. It's A neighbourhood student bar near Columbia university filled with mostly what looked like undergraduate students. Me and my friends didn't get to try any food but the drinks and bartenders nice. It's open till 4am which is fantastic!

First thing we did was notice the sign on the bathroom door which was blatantly non-inclusive and unsupportive of gender neutral use. Including kicking someone out if they were found using the restroom. Therefore, we left immediately. Not supporting this business."

I really do. But as Taffer says, dive bars don't need to be dirty. This rat hole clearly missed the memo. It is FILTHY and the draft beer is spoiled. The other customers were probably NYU students and some were fratty and assholes. Close this hole in the wall."
1739,ErMFay-6o83QB2P1k4ALAg,6/12/2016,1 star rating,"Went here for a birthday party. This is a DIVE bar. Was greeted immediately with a very racially coded ""dress code"" sign on the door (see pic) saying ""no hats or hoods after 10pm"". First of all we all know what they're low key REALLY trying to say, second of all why does a shitty dive bar have a dress code?And it didn't stop there. I went to the bathroom and on the women's door there was yet another offensive sign indicating that the ladies room is for women only and no men are allowed (see other pic) I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt that they are trying to prevent cisgender men from harming women as there have been some incidents in the city of women being assaulted by men in bar bathrooms HOWEVER this combined with the other sign... I can't help but see it as transphobic.Apparently there are a bunch of other weird rules about this place when it comes to playing pool etc.This place is trash. Avoid at all costs."

There is a strong feeling that this is where everyone should be having their meals. The food is tasty, healthy, rich in flavors, rich in cultures, varied, beautiful! 2. ServiceCould not be better. Everyone working here is nice. As a group they seem to be a diverse gang, nicely working together. But it is not only the people, everything is really well thought of. Simple, and effective. You'll be amaze of how well it works, to the extend that you don't even pay attention. 3. DesignThe space, the wall menu, the trays, the bowls, the glasses, the bowls where the food comes from, the little room with the skylight... everything here is an opportunity for care. This is a sanctuary of unpretentious care. An enjoyable spot, where the food is tasty, the people us nice and where you can leave the daily disappointments behind.

I eat meat and fish hut so like to go vegan/vegetarian occasionally. Well, let me tell you, I have been dreaming about going back ever since. The restaurant is kind of like a Panera style. You order at the counter and pay and then grab a seat or take out. We grabbed a seat in the back. I ordered the Tibetan Mama as it was highly recommended by one of the workers. My friend got an autumn bowl that had avocado and Jack fruit. We both enjoyed our dishes. I definitely want to go back to try my friends. The service was good.

Definitely hit the spot with that Moroccan stew - and having it made into a bowl with quinoa made it more filling and delicious.I also really enjoyed the soup of the day, which was a tomato soup, topped with fresh herbs and nuts on top which made the soup much more refreshing.The Chia brownie was also really good, and the cashew cream made it even better! (overall it was good and not too too sweet)The ladies that work here were lovely and very friendly, and despite us coming in late, let us sit around and continue chatting while they cleaned up shop and closed up. Thank you for that!!!I can't believe I've known about this place for so many years and have never stopped by until today.

Base greens are real basic and could use an upgrade, but it comes topped with half an avocado that is crusted with crunchy seeds and quinoa. The bowl is also piled with fresh pea sprouts, thin spirals of carrots, pickled veg, and sauerkraut. Nice, light dressing. Sample of spreads in the mezze plate was also very good. Not a fan of the flavorless gluten free crackers, but the spreads were really tasty- each one unique. My faves were the sweet green pea spread and coconut ""ceviche"" but the bright yellow hummus was also good as well as the one that looked like tuna salad... but was veg friendly.Nice option for a fast, healthy meal. Would come back!"

I'm writing this review for one reason only: their beet caviar. Omg I DREAM about this. I want 7 servings every time I go. It's vegan and has the bite of caviar with the health of beets!

1794,MHuhN-URZQ22Anrpu6juhg,1/25/2022,1 star rating,"Came here for the first time after having driven by a few times. It was lunchtime didn't want to have rice, ordered a Gyro. 7 and change all lettuce very little tasteless meat. I was hungry finished 3/4 of it. Not worth it at all. Also ordered a buklawa I took a bite and wanted no more,  three dollars got me2 pieces not worth taking another bite. Just do not recommend this place."
1795,MHuhN-URZQ22Anrpu6juhg,2/7/2021,4 star rating,"I'm no scientist but if you take the average of Turkish/Middle Eastern/Persian kebabs and divide by Pakistani/Indian/Bangladeshi kebabs, you'd get Afghan kebabs. Not as dry or mild in flavor as their neighbors to the West or as spicy as their neighbors to the East, I find Afghani kebab joints offer the most balanced and perfectly prepared kebabs, and Main Bakhtar are masterful in their contribution.You have several options of beef, chicken, or lamb skewers served over a bed of delicious long grain rice, a side of salad, some bread, and green and white sauces. The meats are succulent and juicy and packed with just enough flavor so they're not overpowering and your protein is the rightful star. I personally love the chicken tikka but am also a fan of their lamb chops and beef tikka as well;  there are several combos to choose from so you can mix and match to your heart's desire. I like their rice and would recommend making it Qabili style by opting for the addition of carrots and raisins for a small upcharge, which will surely turn that like into love. The sauces on the side are perfect complements to the meats and the mildly spicy green sauce mixed with the pleasant white sauce is what dipping drams are made of. The ""salad"" is at best a garnish and consists of lettuce, a few slices or tomato, and perhaps 2-3 slices of cucumber. I wouldn't go to a salad joint and order a T-bone, so may be this isn't you should bookmark if you're a vegan and vegetarian because this is certainly a place meant for carnivores with very few non-meat dishes one of them being the bolani, which are large cheese and scallion stuffed flat dumplings that are flaky, crispy, and thankfully not overly greasy. The ferni dessert is also very delicious and a personal favorite but there are also several other house made dessert options on display from which you can choose from.I always call ahead and the food takes at least 20 minutes but it's always fresh and delicious! The staff are kind and friendly and I haven't had any issues over the course of my many visits. My biggest complaints are the lack of side dishes such as some Afghan style chickpeas, spinach, or okra, but considering how much food you get in each order and at such amazingly low prices, the value considering the portion sizes are perfect and an extra side dish would take you from being full and content to being disgustingly full and about to burst. Great food and always consistent! Definitely recommended!"

1797,MHuhN-URZQ22Anrpu6juhg,10/17/2022,5 star rating,"Incredible. Large portions, lots of mix and match options, and it's flavor-rich and well-priced. I was looking for kebab with veggies and rice -- all the fixings -- and it delivered."
1798,MHuhN-URZQ22Anrpu6juhg,6/30/2019,4 star rating,"Main Bakhtar is not accessible by subway, but is located right next to the Q44 in Flushing. The restaurant has plenty of seats and tables. It was empty when my friend and I visited. Most people order to go. They also do catering. Be sure to bring cash as it is cash only!I had the chicken qorma, and the lamb chops and chicken kebab plate. They come with rice and salad. The food was delicious, especially the lamb chops! The lamb chops are on the small side but they are nicely seasoned and grilled with some crispiness around the edges. The chicken kebab was also nicely grilled and not too dry. The chicken qorma was tender and there are lentils in the dish. The sauce is very tasty! I really enjoyed the slightly spicy and sour green sauce as well. The food was good but the service could be improved."
1799,MHuhN-URZQ22Anrpu6juhg,6/29/2020,4 star rating,"I never dined here before, but some of my Yelp friends have gave this place good reviews. I decided to order takeout from here via Doordash a few weeks ago. I only got the #1 Combination platter and it comes with beef kofta, lamb tikka, chicken tikka over rice. There's also bread and side salad. The meal is definitely 2-3 servings for myself. The food was OK and the meats were a bit dry for me that day. The white and green sauces helped give the meats some more flavor. The rice was tasty and I should have gotten another side order rice to eat with the leftover meats.  Overall, I would give this place another try for takeout and order something different."

Service was attentive despite the never/ending trail of people who kept coming in to do takeout orders. Anyway the dinner bento boxes were perfect - had a variety and we were able to sub out the california rolls for different rolls we wanted ($2 upcharge). Choice of shumai or tempura was great, we went with the tempura and got a generous portion (2 pcs shrimp, 2 sweet potato, big broccoli, and a zucchini). Salmon was also cooked perfectly. The only downside is it was served right on the white rice so the teriyaki sauce made it a bit soggy after a while. Glad to find this neighborhood gem, we would definitely return as it beats going all the way to BK or Forest Hills for decent japanese."

It has been 1 1/2 hours since I placed my order and they just told me my order never left the restaurant, the food may be good but the lack of professionalism is unreal, how are they going to lie about my order being sent out for delivery when it never was. As expect it I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN and DO NOT RECOMMEND IT AT ALL. ALSO SEAMLESS DON'T HELP AT ALL. BOTH SUCKS!"
1839,G1HUAEpZcNHXO1V1gLoASQ,7/22/2019,5 star rating,"THE go-to sushi place in this area. I've been coming here for years, and have always found the food to be consistently delicious. I'm a lover of all raw/cooked sushi along with the standard Jap chicken teriyaki/pork katsu dishes. Sakura never fails to meet my cravings. The salmon and white tuna always taste so fresh. And every special roll I've dared to try met the standard of pretty good to will order repeatedly until I'm sick of it.The service is also excellent. Henry has been running this place amazingly, and the staff are more than accommodating. Even my friends who were originally scared of eating sushi fell in love. This has become my family's spot to celebrate occasions or have a nice dinner. This has also been a regular meetup/reunion spot for my HS friend and I to catch up when she's back from New Hampshire to visit.Love this place, and will continue to come back here!"

Had a Sangria that was made with Hennessy and mixed it with a classic Margarita - called Turbulence. Oh it was frozen as well. Good food choices too. Cheese fries is always a classic. Will be back!!!

Nowhere on the menu does it state that the ""free beer"" is for only SELECT beers. No fine print, no asterisk, nothing anywhere qualifying this ""free beer"" statement. Also, nowhere on the menu does it state that they charge a 20% mandatory gratuity. We sat at the bar and I've never seen a 20% gratuity automatically added to a bill at the bar. We've come here other days and enjoyed the burgers but after this horrible customer service experience and intentionally misleading and frankly illegal menu advertising, we will NOT be back."

My friends got the spicy margarita and it was so spicy they couldn't drink it l, but I guess that's why that drink is called spicy margarita. To start we ordered wings. Since everybody wanted to try different sauces we asked for plain wings and 4 sauces on the side. The wings were P L A I N (no seasoning) and kind of dry. I had the business class sandwich. The fries were really good but the chicken was tasteless and the bacon was old. HOWEVER, my friends ordered nachos and they were super good. If I ever go back I'll definitely order nachos. The service was slow. Our waitress didn't pay much attention to us. It seems like they were more focus on the customers coming in for the party (hooka + drinks)."

I ordered fish and chips (though with salad instead of fries). A lot of places that offer fish and chips don't really seem to know what they're doing -- the fish comes out either soggy or WAY over-cooked.  But the White Oak go it just right - crunchy on the outside, fish properly and not overly cooked on the inside.  It was very good, though the side salad was nothing to write home about (I was just glad to have something on my plate that wasn't fried).I also ordered the onion rings.  Like the fish, the rings were very good.  Super crunchy, not soggy.  Someone in the kitchen really knows how to use a deep fryer.I should have thought to ask my companions how their lunch was, but didn't, regrettably.  I can only say that their lunches definitely LOOKED good, and they all seemed to enjoy them.I don't think I am going to be able to bring myself to eat anything deep fried for a couple of weeks after that meal, but it was really good.  And a good lunch place is definitely something of a find right now, and I will definitely be back there for lunch.Recommended."

I always see the White Oak Tavern when I'm walking around wash square, and I've always wanted to try it--it gives off a very old timey aesthetic, which I admire.I really love the decor in the place!! They had so many cool pictures and mirrors. It was definitely a captivating place to eat at. I will say though that there was no one up front when we walked in. My friend and I stood there for a while and were about to leave, but then someone showed up. It also took a while for us to get served, but the server apologized for the wait because I think they were short staffed that day. It was all good though! We got our food eventually. My friend got a burger, which she said she loved. I wanted to branch out, so I got chicken pot pie for the first time! It was very savory and definitely a comfort food. The food was honestly overpriced in my opinion. It was good, but it wasn't over the top good, and I don't think I'd want to pay that price for that quality of food. It's a really cute place for dinner and for a night out! I loved the experience all in all!"

The servers and staff we absolutely wonderful to me and my party of three as well so hats off to them!One of the pals I brought with me is vegan and was able to enjoy a fully vegan appetizer and meal (though we wished there was a vegan dessert option too!). The brussels sprout appetizer is vegan and, though I'm not vegan myself, was one of the best brussels sprouts dishes I've ever had! It was the perfect balance of sweet, spicy, and crunchy--yum!Next, I tried out an Ancient Grains bowl. While it was good and made me feel healthy, I was unfortunately a tad disappointed in it. I appreciate the vegan option, but it felt underwhelming in flavor and texture. Overall, the experience was lovely and I'll be back! I'll try something else as a main and report back :)."

We only had 2 people so they sat us away from the tree at a 2 top but there's a gorgeous tree in the middle of the bar. There's booths in the back as well so it's perfect for 4 to 6 people to come here. I got the chicken pot pie and my party got the beyond burger which was done so well she said it's the best beyond burger she had in the city (we are not tourists and we eat burgers often) and my chicken pot pie warmed me up as I had almost no food in the day and I was starting to shiver at night this thing filled me up to the brim and I was warm again. I will definitely come back here for some drinks and to try their famous vegetarian lasagna.

But these days the place is pretty much dead, so when you get a slice, its from a pie that has been laying around for some time. The sauce now taste too sweet and the old man makes the pies a bit irregular. One slice will have the outer crust thats less than an inch, and another it will be almost half of it.

Tonight we went for the Thursday night menu. We walked in and were greeted by a lovely guy behind the counter who took our order. We ordered the VIP Plate and some small dishes. Let me tell you about this VIP plate (picture below). This is the ultimate dish to discover everything a hasidic person eats over the weekend. It consists of Cholent, Kugel, Kishka, Egg, Jachnun, Bone Marrow, Flanken, Coleslaw and Pickles. Represent!Holy mother! Everything was so delightful and tasty. The cholent was super flavourful with an abundance of meat. The Kugel was overnight cooked and so damn good. Bone marrow, man oh man! I missed it so much.This entire plate costs $25 and is well worth the experience of a Thursday night or as we call it L'iel Shishi. You guys, I urge you to taste this VIP Dish and thank me later."

So was he afraid I was going to try to touch his hand if he took it from my hand?  By the way, dude, skin contact is something that almost never happens when you hand people your card. I guess if I went to hasidic places more I would have expected that, but it sucks to be treated like you have the plague. Maybe I'd go back to try the cholent and this time make sure to bring a long pole with which to place my credit card on the table. But I doubt I will go again for lunch."

The vermacelli was not spectacular but the banh mi made up for it 100%. It's the first time I have tasted banh mi like this, almost tasted like a beef tartare.. but it was delicious. The store itself sorta sucked because it was TINY and I had to squeeze past the staff and people eating inside to order my food but all was worth it.

I got the classic banh mi and the beef pho. The banh mi bread had a nicely crispy exterior and super soft interior. The filling was delicious (though I wish it had more slices of meat), but it was still really flavorful. The pho was decent. Not necessarily my favorite as it was less aromatic than I usually liked it, but still very good. Everything was excellent considering the price.

We both ordered Bun thit nuong cha gio and set to work eating... service was scant, but once the food was set down on the table the only focus was eating. The vermicelli noodles were were perfectly cooked, the thit was tender and flavorful. The nuoc mam that came with it was sooo good... I practically drenched my cha gio in it and asked for more! I'm conclusion- this is one of the few Vietnamese spots I like in NYC... most of the time I would say save your money and go to Cali for good Viet food. This is definitely one of go to spots now"

The cafe itself is an extremely unassuming spot, tucked away under some scaffolding on 1st. The interior is somewhat small and narrow, but cozy: the lighting is a bit dim, and there's a collection of plants by the windows. Service was friendly and fast--our potstickers were out within 10 minutes.These crunchy potstickers were DELICIOUS. Perfectly fried to a crispy, golden brown, and slightly fragrant from the shrimp, they paired so well with the fresh carrot and radish garnish! One of our party said these were some of the best potstickers they've ever had. $6 well spent.At first, I was skeptical of the pho with vegan broth. I've had some truly miserable, watery vegetarian hotpots and ramens at other restaurants. But this? This sets a new bar for vegan excellence. Full of citrus brightness, deep sweetness, and tofu with just the right amount of bite! I added generous helpings of sriracha and hoisin, which may have helped, but that broth--along with generous heaps of bean sprouts, jalapeño, lime, and basil--really gives me hope that quality vegan pho will become more of a thing.Hard to beat the $11 price.

1894,s33YfAM1ScJKccyzqtYtpA,7/5/2019,4 star rating,"Great place for fresh bao and lemon/milk tea. Their bao is wrapped in protective sealed practice and they are in enclosed containers instead of out in the open which I like just in case flies get inside. They are also usually well stocked and don't run out of bao and if they do they usually have another batch being made. They now have a machine that puts a seal over your drinks which is so helpful if you're getting one on the go rather than sitting down inside. It is air conditioned but quite dirty inside. However, there is a lot of seating so you don't have to worry about grabbing a chair. The menu on the wall is in large print and shows all the prices both in Chinese and English. One of my go to bakeries in Chinatown."

Fresh, light, flaky and buttery crust. The custard was a bit bland and watery. The eggy flavor isn't as noticeable but it's light, smooth and slightly sweet. They have a nice selection of baked goods. Seating is available, the bakery is quite spacious.It can get packed and disorganized at times. Most baked goods are within reach. If you're interested in a mini or regular sized cake, do your best to get someones attention. On busy days, there really isn't an organized line. Everyone stands around the cashiers and does their best to get noticed.Though their Egg Tarts are a bit pricey, their other baked goods are reasonably priced."
1899,s33YfAM1ScJKccyzqtYtpA,4/17/2010,3 star rating,"A newly opened bakery that brings another addition to the Manna House Bakery (MHB) franchise in Chinatown. While the selection is not as good as MHB on Catherine Street, all of the distinct qualities (style, taste, texture) for ""Manna-style"" buns are there. A grand opening discount of 20% off baked goods is also now in full effect. Not sure how long that would last. Without the discount, a typical bun (pineapple, cocktail, roast pork) goes for 85-90 cents. It is quite surreal to see that baked goods in Chinatown bakeries are closing in on a dollar apiece.  This is by far the largest space for an MHB I have seen. Beyond the counter where hoards of customers are going yelling out orders for buns and cakes, a seating area with a handful of tables is available in the back. The seating area space is definitely not fully utilized, and it can easily accomodate a few more tables.I do missed the dried pork and ham rolls that the previous bakery offered, but if there were to replace it with any other chain, such as a Golden Carriage or Tai Pan, a MHB is easily the preferred choice (in my humble opinion of course). 3,5 Stars"

And on the opposite end of that spectrum, the risotto tako balls had no taste.The best thing was the friend chicken miyazaki and their desserts.

The staff are quite attentive and the food came out in a decent amount of time. They are known for their sushi bombs, but I personally did not find them that amazing; next time I will be sticking with the rolls. The sushi bombs are almost the size of a slice of a roll, but with a lot more rice. The appetizers were my favorite part of the meal. They come in great portions to share with 2-4 people (depending how much of each you want) and the hot pot was especially delicious with generous amounts of seafood in it. What we ordered:* Spicy seafood hot pot - great app to share, split between 4 people each person can have a bowl* Veggie Gyoza - not my favorite, but not made for a veg dumpling* Una avo roll* Spicy tuna roll* Tuna avo roll* Spicy mc. bomb - great flavor* Pink bomb - scallion is a great addition* Hotate bomb - too much rice, not much flavor* Iced yuzu ginger tea - loved this, very refreshing* Lychee Martini - very creamyThings to know: * Came for an early ish dinner and were lucky to get a table* There is a good amount of seating in the back; they also have sushi bar seating"

I believe this may be the only restaurant where I ordered 1 dinner item on a slow night and yet somehow it was forgotten.  I love sushi and had this place bookmarked, so was excited to give it a shot. We planned for a 9pm reservation to avoid a crowd, with a movie to follow at Nitehawk nearby in the neighborhood. The ambience has a cool vibe, and we sat at the bar which was not busy this late with multiple open seats. We ordered 2 appetizers pretty quickly - the ceviche special and the seafood hotpot. Short of 5 minutes later ordered the party bomb sushi platter as an entree to share, and saw the bartender go to the kiosk right after my order. Both appetizers came out fairly quick and tasted great. From there we waited for our sushi platter and I ordered a cocktail to hold me over. We noticed a bunch of other customer's food coming out, but also noticed the visible kitchen line slowing down. After waiting about 30 min we asked the waiter to check our order and it was 9:50 at this point, so 10 minutes before they close. He checked with both of the guys working behind the bar who were looking back at us - it was very clear they forgot to put in the 1 dinner item we ordered. The one guy we ordered with came back to confirm the order and he seemed a bit embarrassed, but after waiting this long for nothing, we had to rush out (to catch our movie) so they just apologized several times however did not offer to comp anything. With trying to catch a late dinner before a movie but not getting one, this definitely ruined our evening. Thinking back, I had to wave someone down anytime I wanted to order an item. Not a good experience but the tease of appetizers we received were enjoyable so giving a 2 instead of a 1."
1904,lxQ-tzFmL1tmUqZUN-CSRQ,2/2/2023,1 star rating,Nothing about dining here was memorable. The sushi m/sashimi was sub par and the martinis were basic at best . I honestly dont remember what it was that we ordered but I remember being confused because we weren't sure if we would eat the top layer of the dish in the 2nd picture . The waitress /host wasn't helpful (couldn't tell us what the paper was) and honestly service sucked . Wont be going back there ... one star because the fish was fresh and I didn't get sick.
1905,lxQ-tzFmL1tmUqZUN-CSRQ,3/11/2023,5 star rating,"Okay so I highly recommend this place for SO many reasons? First of all I have no idea of any other sushi place that does sushi bombs -- and they should because it's truly sushi 2.0! The party bomb special is my favorite--they come with a variety of party bombs with are like sushi but with larger portions and it is magical let me tell you. We also got the pork belly app and it was (and still is because I order it every time I come here) a taste bud party. The vibe here is super hip and cool and it's perfect for an evening meal with friends or family and simultaneously the perfect date night spot. The best part? The price. Prices here compared to other sushi places of the same quality fish are SO much more reasonable and with larger and more generous portions. Last but not something to skip over--the service is fast and amazing with always kind wait staff who are very attentive. I'll be back again, cause I can't seem to stay away! Definitely check it out!"
1906,lxQ-tzFmL1tmUqZUN-CSRQ,7/17/2022,4 star rating,"Trying to find good sushi spots are hard. We went to Bozu because we were intrigued by their ""bombs"" We started with edamame and we really loved the flavor on these that we ended up eating it all! We couldn't stop eating them. Then we got the party bomb. We tried one of each and then grabbed our favorites the second time around. Each roll has 3 pieces so we both got to try one piece of each roll then chose which roll we wanted to eat again. It worked out great since we both had different preferences. In all each roll was good! The bombs are just domes of sushi instead of it packed into a roll. So the rice is on the bottom in a dime shape and then the toppings on top. It can get messy to eat but worth it! We needed one more roll to fill us up so we got the stinky salmon roll. This was good but not as good as the bombs."
1907,lxQ-tzFmL1tmUqZUN-CSRQ,12/21/2022,5 star rating,"Delicious sushi and won't break the bank! Friendly for casual solo dining or dates. The volume is low so you can easily hear the person across from you. We didn't need a reservation for a Monday night dinner for 2. We were greeted at the door and seated immediately. Lighting is dim and cozy. I tried their specialty: sushi bombs. Went with the spicy mcbomb which comes with spicy mayo and crunch at the top. I wouldn't call it a spicy dish at all as the sauce was very mild. They had some heartier appetizers under the ""to fill up"" section. I shared garlic fried chicken and the veggie gyoza. I also tried the tako risotto balls. They were warm, cheesy and delicious. Everything was plated nicely. Loved the cocktail options as well. Went with a passion fruit margarita. Definitely coming back to try more!"
1908,lxQ-tzFmL1tmUqZUN-CSRQ,11/21/2022,3 star rating,"So I've been to Bozu over the years and I've always liked their various sushi bombs and appetizers. However, our experience this time was unfortunately disappointing and let me explain why below:Appetizers:Garlic chicken - this was overly salty and dry, making the meat inside very tough. The little greens that acted as a bedding to the chicken helped a bit, but it wasn't delicious whatsoever; you can't taste the garlic at all.Double Cheesy Tako Risotto Balls - this was extremely bland and flavorless. I wish this was like a fried version of a takoyaki but it's not; it's very dry and tasteless. Definitely do not recommend this at all.Pork belly - this was interesting and the sauce on top was good, but the pork belly itself was over cooked; the fat is obviously soft but the thin pork belly was tough and chewy. It was interesting but I wouldn't order it again.Sushi bombs:These were very good as it always were, so if you come here I definitely recommend trying their sushi bombs, especially the party bomb set. Our favorite was the scallop/hotate, salmon belly, and yellowtail toro. So why 3 stars instead of 4 if appetizers were horrible and entree was good? It's because of the service. The server was friendly and made small talks which was nice, but their service was extremely slow (for example, we waited 20+ minutes for appetizers and another 20 for 5 bombs). Last time we sat at the counter and were served quicker, so maybe don't sit in the back where it was heated and seated larger parties like ours. Furthermore, they charged us a cake fee per person, where they don't even serve the cake for us. After spending 400 dollars on dinner, I would think a more understanding server would allow us to eat our birthday cake without a fee...I understand that some restaurant still charges a cake fee, but those are rare and are usually catered towards more fine-dine experiences that align with their image. Nonetheless, this experience was definitely a disappointing one and I'm not sure the sushi bombs alone is enough to draw us back sadly :/Hope this helps and thank you for reading (:"
1909,lxQ-tzFmL1tmUqZUN-CSRQ,12/4/2022,5 star rating,Super yummy! We started off with pork gyoza and they tasted very authentic and the sauce was delicious. There was a skirt around the bottom but it wasn't super crispy. Then we got a pink bomb and shiro bomb (three each) as well as white & red rolls and salmon stinky rolls (six each). My favorites were the shiro bombs and stinky rolls. The wasabi soy sauce is delicious. Service was very fast and they very promptly refilled waters. Would come again! The lighting is a little dark so if you have trouble seeing in low lighting you may need to use a phone flashlight or something.

I've been here once, but was in such a rush I had no time for food pics, or check-in on Yelp. So this is my first time writing an actual review.The queue to get in is short and fast. The restaurant is more of a free standing restaurant. When entering customers can grab their drinks from the refrigerator first, then order your food from the self service kiosks. As an airport employee, I followed all the TSA Agents as they waited for a live person to take your order instead of using a kiosk.What I ordered was a double shack cheeseburger and french fries. It only took about 5 minutes for my order to come out. They don't have tables, but what other airport employees did was head back to the Food Hall area where there were dining tables and high bar stool seating so I could enjoy my ""breakfast"" before heading to the gate.

1912,v7mIzZtXgU4o1RPtPRoyZA,1/10/2023,3 star rating,"I can barely tolerate Shake Shack's high price points as-is at their standalone restaurants. So I wasn't too enthusiastic about going to this airport location because I knew it would be even more expensive. Unfortunately, dining options are limited here. There are two Shake Shacks at JFK. Both are inside Terminal 4 after clearing security; one near Gate B23 and the other is near Gate B37. B23 is open every day from 5:00 AM to 9:00 PM and B37 is open from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM. B37 has a dining area with power outlets, while B23 does not. The overall decor and theme is consistent with their restaurants outside the airport. They have their signature wood tables as well, all made using recycled materials from former bowling alleys. On the menu you will find breakfast sandwiches, hot dogs, burgers, shakes, drinks, and more. Comparing the prices to the average Shake Shack in Queens, expect to pay around 20% extra here. There was a long line to order and use the kiosk, mobile ordering seemed a little faster. There is a sign nearby with a QR code that you scan with your phone and it'll direct you to a website. My friend had the SmokeShack, which is my go-to. It's a cheeseburger with chopped peppers, bacon, and angus beef. They thought it was fine, the potato bun was soft and the patty was juicy. It was not spicy at all; normally it should have a little more kick to it. The accompanying crinkle cut fries could've used more salt but was otherwise crispy. I decided to get a ""lighter"" lunch at Bento Sushi nearby, so I just got the original Shack-made lemonade. It was sweet and natural tasting. If you're really craving this, go to literally any other location in the city before your flight or after you leave the airport."

The fries here are also super tasty! Fair warning that the food takes forever to get ready. It was fairly busy when we stopped by for dinner, and it took easily upwards of ~30 minutes for our takeout box to arrive.

I made it clear to our bartender that the last time I was there, the bar tender that served us made a comment that I had a roll, which seemed like is was a joke that was laughed off amongst all of us prior to us leaving. She never once made it clear that it was a problem for them or suggested that I shouldn't have done that.This time we were advised to finish our last drink,close out tab, and leave before her boss came in. Let's be clear that I needed it to blow my nose, clean my hands, wipe my mouth, etc! Not use it for a bathroom trip outside of their business!!!

They are always adding new machines, more drinks, AND more food! I was so impressed with how their menus have grown and continue to include a variety of food allergies. The bathrooms are gender neutral and the space is expansive and so well organized for being a St. Marks bar! Rarely are the games broken. It's such a chill spot. Stairs lead down to the game floor but otherwise accessible and maneuverable. Friendly for people of all ages but there is a bouncer so I don't know if that's for night time or all the time.

I don't recall how I felt or what I did back then because we stumbled in after drinking all morning leading into the afternoon. Came here a few weeks ago with a guy and it was fine. We played a few games, stepped out and went back to play more games. It was fine for what it was since I liked my company at the time. The drinks are your standard bar drinks. Nothing extraordinary or fancy, but not the vibe they are going for. A good place if you like playing arcade games. Will go back here with guy friends since they are obsessed with video games and like St. Marks."

There is a change machine to purchase the coins to operate the games . We enjoyed the house of the dead shooting game and the bub . There were also three pinball games which take 3 token each. Not expensive for the games IMO . The beer list is great as well and we enjoyed the happy hour price of $1 off.

That being said, this one is nice and met some essentials. They have drinks, they have food (which I didn't try as I was stuffed), and of course they have arcades! I had a couple hours to kill before my train departed the city, so I figured why not game for a bit?? So I showed my ID and vax card (at the time it was needed) and took in the environment. One thing I definitely appreciated is that there plenty of outlets around so I could charge my phone :). Anyways, I went to the token machine, got some coins, and got some cocktails -- I particularly enjoyed the rum / Campari-based Jungle Bird. Very tasty cocktail that washed down all that food I had prior. I found myself mainly playing the Pac-Mans. Millipede would've been a fun one, but it wasn't around! All in all though, Barcade is a good NYC staple and you'll enjoy yourself with friends for a couple of hours if you come through!"

But the crowning glory is that Aaliyah or Alia or Leah behind the bar (I'm so sorry I do a lot of asking people's names so I can leave them nice reviews and sometimes I forget) was so so sweet to both me and the rowdier patrons at the bar that I won't hesitate to be back.I've heard from a few people on bumble that this bar has Mario kart but I have yet to see it. Besides Alia that's the main reason for this review, so I hope within a few weeks the Mario kart will rear its head and I'll be able to get a lap or two into rainbow road. Happy Nintendo-ing !!!"

1960,v2dtG37r1ThqtfEfiFsAUg,10/22/2022,4 star rating,"Came here last year and would've given it five stars then but alas! Things seem to have changed. Last year when I visited, it was slow and I had a long chat with the owner. She said she'd been at this location through thick and thin. When the panoramic hit hard, she was one of the first ones on the block to set up plastic barriers and sell takeout through a small window in it. She also proudly mentioned how author Min Jin Lee (author of Pachinko) had visited and how there was an article about her in the paper. I had the spicy jjajangmyeon twice in the span of 3 days at that time and the owner brought me extra spicy powder to kick it up even further. The noodles were yellow and oh so chewy and bouncy and just beautiful. The sauce wasn't too sweet, the meat was tender and delicious. Cut to now and the noodles are white instead of yellow. The sauce is blander and the spicy version isn't spicy in the least. I wonder what happened in the last year - I hope things go back to the way they were. As for the ambiance, it's got the vibe of a club. Music isn't playing too loudly, but it's there. There's a lot of neon lights and there's a bar at the end. Some cheesy decorations out front - it's an interesting take. I'm sure they bring in higher sales by leaning into the alcohol consumption. But it's not /really/ a club and doesn't really seem to be a place where people go for a crazy night out partying and drinking."

Apparently, it's one of the oldest restaurants on the main K-Town block. I am always on the hunt for the best jjajangmyeon and tangsooyuk for my folks. It's one of their favorite foods so I went with the intention of scouting this place out for them. The hostess and serving staff are awesome. Really warm, friendly and professional.The food was fair. I was hoping for better. As you can see from the interior, this place is geared for a younger night crowd. It was pretty empty when I was there during prime lunch time."
1962,v2dtG37r1ThqtfEfiFsAUg,11/2/2022,3 star rating,Went to Shanghai mong the other day and want to get some nice soup. My jjamppong soondubu was really tasty and flavorful with spiciness . My boyfriends soup which was the Pho was not so much. The beef was clumped up in a grounded beef way and pretty chewy compared to actual Vietnamese spots.  The service was okay and pretty standard. Ambience was pretty loud but not to complain since we were in the middle of ktown. Overall food was decent (except the pho) and will give it another chance.

1964,v2dtG37r1ThqtfEfiFsAUg,1/12/2023,3 star rating,Honestly the food and service has definitely declined over the years. I remember coming to shanghai Mong years back and loving their jjajangmyun and jjampong combo. This was my favorite restaurant for jjajangmyun since a majority of the other restaurants don't really serve it. When I came recently they didn't honor the yelp check in offer and the combo that I got just wasn't hitting the same. I would pass on the sweet and sour pork because that was more soggy and not juicy enough. I probably would still get the jjajangmyun but maybe for takeout.

I will always return back here! My only complaint is that I'm nearly positive they used to have Pad Thai on the menu, however, when I came back, I saw there was only ""Thai Noodles"". They were still good but I would much rather have the Pad Thai. For a Korean place to even offer this is still more than I can ask for."

But tonight we stopped for bite and not as good as it once was. But.. people need to be careful with dinner receipts.Total bill was attached with breakdown receipt on the bottom that already has added on tip of 18% that was added to the dinner bill but top receipt only shows total amount (included tip) and there also was another tip line. If you don't look closely you will end up paying a tip again to the total amount that that already calculated in the total. Never seen anything like this before anywhere in NY.  I don't know if this is common practice but....

My issue isn't with the food but the workers at this establishment. I signed up on the blimpies website to receive coupons and deals via email & text for this specific location. When you sign up on the website it makes you do so. So any deals I receive are only for this location. Meaning I can not use it at any other Blimpies location. With that said, I've attempted to use the coupons 2x. First time I was told I needed to have the coupon printed. Even though clearly the coupon stated otherwise and I could use the mobile app coupon. I let that incident slide. Today I attempted to use another coupon & was met with  resistance by the cashier person. He refuse to honor the coupon. Stated they only have deals on Monday & insisted in giving me a flyer for their already Monday deal of buy 1 get another free. Something I already knew from coming here for 15+ years. As I explained to the cashier, the coupon doesn't state it's a Monday deal. It was a coupon for every day use with an expiration of the following month. Again the cashier refused to look at the coupon. I chose to not make a scene because I did not want to look insane arguing over a coupon... but it's the principal. Terrible customer service. I plan on letting corporate know about this. Blimpies is a small chain in my area and with other companies like jersey mikes, subways, jimmy johns & Fire house subs... you  would thinks they would want to keep  their loyal customers.

1990,RQic4NVDNhCwJRCK-Rgp0w,12/5/2022,3 star rating,Just ok on the regular Chinese food scale but pretty good on the halal scale. It's a bit on the pricier side because they're using halal meat. Sanitation is a step higher than the ordinary no-frills Chinese. Workers are nice ppl if you talk to them nice. Used to be really good around a decade ago. Fell of really hard
1991,RQic4NVDNhCwJRCK-Rgp0w,5/11/2022,1 star rating,"So This is my second time ordering from this place, only ordered a second time because I believe in second chances and just like the first time the food was uneditable and tasteless and filled with oil l, oil that tasted like some type of gasoline. I ordered a broccoli with garlic sauce and vegetable lo mien and tso chicken. None was editable, I threw it all out."
1992,RQic4NVDNhCwJRCK-Rgp0w,8/27/2022,1 star rating,Food is awful. Pricey and bad quality orange chicken is all breading- you cant even find the chicken. Save yourself the money and go somewhere else. This place is not it. They dont even tell you it is cash only until you arrive.
1993,RQic4NVDNhCwJRCK-Rgp0w,6/24/2022,5 star rating,Best halal Chinese food in NYC!! There service is great and food is amazing. I've recommended it to so many people and each person usually loves it! Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.
1994,RQic4NVDNhCwJRCK-Rgp0w,1/2/2018,3 star rating,"Halal Kitchen ""Chinese"" food is A-OK (3.5Star) in my opinion. First, the food is Halal so that is a big plus for anyone seeking Halal Food :) Second, you will notice the place is clean and does not have a smell. Third, the staff are really nice and attentive. They will bring you complimentary crackers with ducksauce and really fast in bringing the order as they are made, as other places they will wait until all dishes are completed before they bring it !!!I am quiet surprise to see such negative reviews regarding this spot, however me and my family every time we have arrived here were greeted in friendly manner and staff came and asked us how we are doing, how our food is, if there's anything else we need ...I would highly recommend the General Sco Dish, the soup is OK nothing great however I like the Lo Mein."
1995,RQic4NVDNhCwJRCK-Rgp0w,9/2/2020,5 star rating,"Delicious take out! Deserves better ratings. General TSO, beef lo mein, beef with vegetables, and sweet and sour chicken were some of the best i have ever had.Highly Recommend"
1996,RQic4NVDNhCwJRCK-Rgp0w,1/11/2019,5 star rating,"As a resident of the neighborhood, I've definitely ordered my fair share of take outs from this restaurant. I've been to the actual restaurant at least twice. I've ordered delivery on Ubereats six times.I don't really know why they call this place ""Halal Kitchen"".. most people would probably refer to this place as regular Chinese take out. The food is affordable and it's basically your regular Chinese take out food. You can't really complain. It's clean, on time, hot, and tasty. If you are looking for something healthy, they have the Dieter's Special which is freshly steamed food. I have no complaints."
1997,RQic4NVDNhCwJRCK-Rgp0w,12/20/2019,1 star rating,I would highly urge anyone not to get food delivered from here. Their food is at pair with any Chinese take out but their service is atrocious. Often orders are missing and they do not correct it. Will tell you the will add it to your next order. Which is a joke. Food comes comes cold and delivered 2 hours later. Sadly I guess this is the price I paid for eating halal Chinese. Will no longer order from here going forward.
1998,RQic4NVDNhCwJRCK-Rgp0w,8/26/2019,5 star rating,I enjoyed their food a lot. As I was trying to reduce weight I ordered from their dieter special side which is steamed chicken and vegetables for about $7 they gave garlic sauce on the side and regular rice. On its own the chicken is a pleasure to eat as it's cooked well while still having a pleasant flavor; the sauce was a nice accompaniment. I did not have delivery issues as I used Uber Eats. I would get this order again and likely will soon.

This isn't the best pad thai by any means, but it gets the job done. I got the lunch special-- tofu, pad thai and a drink. Decent amount of food, but a $21 lunch special is a bit steeper with the quality of the food...especially compared to other spots in the neighborhood. You could do better, but you also could do far worse. Make sure to bring cash, or a phone with Venmo."
2001,3KlWyCJ2BikxwcEb0-O4Ww,9/24/2022,3 star rating,You walk into their kitchen well sort off because of where the door is located.  The sit down is basic but they are super friendly and have great specials.  If you're looking for something quick then run in there.  They only accept cash and Venmo payments.  The place is clean but not my style.  I've eaten at Ron's of Thai restaurants.  I ordered shrimp pad Thai and my friend ordered beef udon noodles.  He was satisfied but my pad Thai seemed a bit too orange and not flavorful.  Check out my pics.  They are friendly but I'm not totally impressed by my experience.

2003,3KlWyCJ2BikxwcEb0-O4Ww,6/13/2022,3 star rating,"Thai Cafe is one of the best Thai restaurants in Greenpoint, but since Covid their pricing has become absurd. I ordered a large plate of plain steamed broccoli -- no sauce, no meat-- and with tax they charged me $15.19 (!!!? A single side order of broccoli is listed at $6.00 on their menu. If I had ordered two side orders it would only have been $12, plus tax. Chicken and broccoli is listed on their menu at $13.95 (plus tax)- a very reasonable price for chicken and broccoli. But why they would charge more for plain broccoli than for a dish with that includes chicken is a mystery. I called to speak with someone at Thai Cafe about this, and she justified her pricing. I have been gogint to Thai cafe for over 15 years, it is very sad that they are taking advantage of their loyal customers in this way!"

I got the pad kee mao, which is suppose to be spicy and full of flavor. It tastes like slightly spicy cardboard. I also got the veggie version, it had one big piece of tofu & a weird array of veggies that you don't usually find in the dish. Seems like they just threw all the scrap veggies into a dish. I don't live in GP but I know there's better places than this."

Additionally you have to access the pictures of each cake on your own phone on instagram. There's no wifi in the building and the wifi they do have, is only available for employees. I had to practically beg for an employee to let me borrow a workers phone to see the cakes. Speaking to each person was like pulling teeth. Their cakes may be decent but you can pay the same price for cakes and have much better customer service. Save time and don't go here."

The great thing about Angela's is that you can call in your order and in a few hours you can have a fresh baked cake designed especially for your event!  Angela's also has a variety of fresh baked pastries and ""empanadas!"" Yes I finally found a place that makes delicious empanadas like the ones we used to buy as kids from the corner of Tremont and University Avenue in the Bronx. If you're experimenting and just want to try out the goodness they sell pastries and cake by the slice or if you need a cake for your special event they sell cakes by the pound."

I recently ordered a cake for a birthday and was hung up on 3 times prior to getting my order taken - when I finally got someone on the phone I was given the nastiest attitude when placing my cake order, the girl hung up on me before I could even confirm she had taken my order correctly. I arrived to pick up the cake a few days later and turns out the order was never even placed! I had to wait half hour to finally get a cake all while staff handled the situation very rudely (as if my business to them was for free). As much as I loved their cakes I will never give these people my business again, neither will my family or friends."

The establishment is cute, small and very crowded especially during the holidays and Mother's Day. I've always gotten great customer service as a walk in. Honestly I've never pre-ordered, I just show up and ask for 1/2 pounds cake in whatever color and it's decorated and given to me within 10-15 minutes, even during their busiest times. I did a random walk in on Mother's Day and traffic coming in and out of this bakery was insane. I couldn't believe the amount of people. I was so worried I wouldn't get a cake because I didn't pre-order, but of course they helped me. The staff were very friendly and courteous even under a lot of pressure with so many clients. I'm really not exaggerating when I say there were about 70+ people who came in and out during my 15 minute wait for a cake. The flavors are amazing, the cream is amazing. True Dominican cake that'll have all your friends and family raving. I'm actually coming back tomorrow for a cake since I'm hosting family game night and it was requested. Prices are also great! I pay $25 for 1/2 huge cake."

They also have the most tender and well seasoned popcorn chicken. Their bowls (both pork, chicken and eggplant) are all delicious. I love that they add in the pickled veggies for extra flavor to the bowls. The pickled lotus roots and the lotus root chips are mind blowing delicious if you like pickled stuff. I have low acidity tolerance due to my stomach and I will still eat an entire order of this without hesitation. It's that good."
2020,fUcjBGgmTlvxXn2azvAijw,3/20/2023,4 star rating,"I recently revisited Yumpling and was pleased to find that the restaurant was quiet. However, I did encounter an issue where the staff appeared to be robotic and was unable to accommodate my request to switch out an item from the rice bowl I ordered. Despite this, the food itself was consistent and good and my order was ready within a reasonable amount of time.To improve the customer experience, I suggest that the staff receive training on how to accommodate customer requests for modifications to their orders. It would also be great if Yumpling featured specials to add variety to their menu and prevent customers from having to order the same dishes repeatedly. Overall, I enjoyed my visit and would recommend Yumpling to others."
2021,fUcjBGgmTlvxXn2azvAijw,2/17/2023,4 star rating,I stick to the dumplings and they've never let me downMy only issue is their hours of operation!!Business must be good to close Monday & Tuesdays. AND from 2pm-5pm daily the days they are open. Shame because my lunch break is at 2pm :(
2022,fUcjBGgmTlvxXn2azvAijw,2/3/2023,3 star rating,"*3.5/5 starsI pass this spot every day to get to the 7 train, so you know I had to give it a shot!I ordered the 3 items below, which ended up being sufficient for 2 meals & cost $50 after tax and tip.Garlicky cucumbers: So refreshing, light, and tangy. Aromatic from the sesame oil and garlic, and lightly sour from the vinegar marinade. I could eat a massive bowl of this on a hot summer day. Pork Yumplings: Deliciously fried. Flavorful meaty filling that's well-balanced by the thick crispy dumpling skin -- def heftier than most dumplings I've had in my life, which is not a bad thing in the slightest. They also heap tiny scallion coils on top, along with chili oil. Dumpling + scallion + chili oil is a goated combo.Beef noodle soup: Sad sad sad. The primary reason Yumpling got docked to 3.5 stars. This was disappointing, or maybe I'm just spoiled by the noodles at neighboring Noodlecraft. The broth was thin and felt more like liquid sauces mixed with hot water. The noodles were okay; beef chunks were on the dry side. It was the broth that really did it in for me, though. Would not recommend.Yumpling is on the pricier side. I got takeout, so no comment on the ambience (it seemed nicely decorated from the 30 seconds I spent inside). I think I just whiffed with the beef noodle soup (majorly whiffed). If the rest of the menu is more like the cucumbers and pork dumplings, then Yumpling's doing just fine."

I've ordered for pickup more times than I have dined in, and unfortunately I only have a picture of the Taiwanese beef noodle soup to share in my review. Highly recommend trying this place. Their chicken is extremely tender and juicy -- and it keeps its consistency when ordering togo! My favorites from this restaurant are their dumplings and popcorn chicken. Their portions are well sized. Service is very fast and the workers are all kind. There's one worker who's always making conversation with customers and I love it. There are only a few tables for dine in so it gets full pretty quickly during dinner hours. Great place for a casual dinner!"

2026,fUcjBGgmTlvxXn2azvAijw,1/22/2023,5 star rating,I came here on Thursday night and i really enjoyed it. Now i ordered the spicy chicken sandwich which was so delicious. I also ordered the pork and chives dumplings which were really delicious fresh and nice stuffed. Inside it is brightly lit and the person taking the order was very nice. You can easily get full from the chicken sandwich because it is big enough but I was greedy and was unsure when I would go back. So I ordered both the chicken sandwich and the dumplings. In my dumpling order there were 8 dumplings but I ate 4 and took 4 to go home. I would definitely come back I want to try their other items and the service was great. I paid $24.00 and I thought that was a bit steep but then I did get two items and had leftovers and the food was very fresh so it is fair. Everything is going up so i do understand the pricing of the items. They also had free water which I love.

So while burritos aren't really Mexican food to me (they're not a thing in Mexico City anyway), breakfast burritos are most certainly southwestern to me and I built up very high standards after those 10 years in the desert state. With that preface, the breakfast burrito here was good, but not mind blowing. Good breakfast burritos in New York are hard to come by - to this day, I can't think of a single one that matches anything in Arizona. But this one was good. It was definitely above average in the NYC breakfast burrito lineup. I'm still searching for the one though. Friendly service though and a few seats outside which is great."

They also have another location in NYC as well.It was about a 15 minute wait before we were seated. This restaurant actually gets packed. It's totally fancy inside with white table cloth and showcases their silverware. Their waiters spoke really good English. It's one of those restaurant you can bring your clients, go with a group of friends or dine with family. It's really worth it to go with a group.Peking Duck House signature dish is its duck. Their menu is customized in such a way where you can order 1/2 duck for a group of two or four. So there were three of us and we were able to order 1/2 duck for a group of 2. Our orders came with two soups, four spring rolls, chicken with peanuts that's served with salad leaf and a few beef skewers.Our order came with one entree so we decided to get the shrimp fried rice.Now back to the duck, they sliced it up into pieces and served in a plate. They also served with a taco kinda wrap, celeries, cucumbers and this brown sauce that's addicting.The duck is then seasoned and roasted, often in a vertical oven, until the skin is crispy and golden.Basically you can make your own duck taco. It's the most delicious, tasty and crispy duck I'd ever tried.You can also bring your own wine which is always a plus.Excellent services! A bit pricey, but overall the food was delicious and atmosphere was just amazing. Enjoy!"

Here, I have never had table side carving or wraps made whereas I believe they still do this at the midtown location - it's super crowded in here so I guess that is why. The other entrees are always tasty but super greasy and like elevated Chinese take out. Sizzling beef as well as the shrimp and general tso chicken stood out. Appetizers that come with the set menu are decent too."
2051,6LfskUyZzmcDSV6h5kOwGw,1/26/2023,2 star rating,"Went here to celebrate Lunar New Year. Nice and clean restaurant with reasonably okay service when compared to similar restaurants in Chinatown.We tried the whole Peking Duck. Sad to report but it lacked flavor, seemed like it was flash cooked, and the skin lacked the crispy consistency you'd expect from a Peking Duck. They have some nerve calling themselves Peking Duck House. What a shame! Tried the dumplings as well and it was ""doughy"" and raw. Lacked basic flavors.Average chicken fried rice.Now the hunt continues for better option."

We got sat at a table for 4, but we were 5. We didn't mind and just popped a chair at the end of the table. Also the tables were really close to one another which didn't give you much personal space!The service was ok, they give you some water for the table and 1 small cup of soy sauce for the whole table to share. We realized maybe we should've gotten a bigger table once all the food came in and we were struggling to make everything fit, but that just added to the experience.The food was pretty good. We shared a whole bunch of appetizers and they were great. The cold noodles were super nice for a hot evening, and I should note that the serving size was quite big. The steamed dumplings were yummy as well, but felt a tad dry (nothing that dipping it in soy sauce can't fix). The scallion pancake was good, but just a bit too fried for my taste.Overall, good restaurant with tasty food and generous serving sizes! Just wish there was more space in between tables for the sake of conversation and servers moving around."

Because we were in the front, we were able to move around and table hop where appropriate.  If we got loud, no one was mad.  This is a place you should consider for a large group."

The dumpling wrappers were hard and thick, and I'm fairly certain they were prebought wrappers. Duck was good, as was the sauce. However, rather than traditional wrappers, they gave us gigantic tortillas."

But they just revamped their menu and it's now even better and deserves some kudos for that. The fried chicken sando was always a mainstay for me but they updated the breading to be a bit spicier and it sticks to the chicken much more effectively. The chicken itself is also juicier. It's now graduated from an ole faithful to one of my favorite chicken sandwiches in the area. Now they also have an amazing new dipping sauce called hot garlic Mayo. What is it?  Unsure. It tastes a bit like a remoulade and has tons of flavor. It is amazing on the chicken sandwich and also... on tots. Did I mention the tots? They have some kind of Cajun spicing on them that really makes them amazing. Ive also tried the veggie Mac. I thought it was ok but I also was deathly Ill and I hear the crawfish mac is amazing. All in all Heavy Woods is even better now than it was. The drinks and bartenders are reliably good. It's a fun spot and I've seen folks post up with a book or come with friends for trivia. Perfect neighborhood spot, new and improved!"

I can't recommend it too highly because the prices were a bit steep for what you're really getting, but if you share the small plates with a friend, then that helps a lot. Overall it's a nice place with a good setup inside, the beer selection is solid, and the people there are fun to talk to. Try it out if you're curious."

The Big Easy Tofu Po'Boy was actually better than I expected, and the bread it was served on was really good. The breading on the Fried Chicken Sandwich had an amazing crunch, although the meat could have been a bit juicier. The Jambalaya and Deviled Eggs also hit the spot. It's a bit out of the way for me, so I probably won't be back. But definitely check them out if you're from the area."

I've tried this place several times, I've had the gumbo, jambalaya, cajun burger, mac and cheese and my least favorite was the Mardi Gras special crawfish po'boy, it was dry and boring. I've been to New Orleans many times and this food is a watered down version of the real thing. Also FYI playing 80's music for a Mardi Gras themed party is not very festive. I am giving this place a 3 stars because the food ins't terrible it just isn't cajun and they do have Purple Haze on tap, so there's that."

They don't have oat milk, but they did offer almond milk with the coffee. The coffee ended up being $5, which i thought was steep for drip coffee. I ordered the Cobb salad with shrimp- the dressing was really good but the salad itself was very ordinary. I wish there was an option to get an extra egg on the salad instead of the shrimp. My friends portions were also really small for the price. Overall: decent food, but nothing spectacular. I probably would choose another brunch place in the area next time"

The biscuits were fluffy, savory and so delicious. Generally, too much hollandaise sauce tends to make me feel nauseous but I really loved the eggs florentine here. Staff was extremely attentive and polite. We were greeted warmly at the door and care was taken to ensure they knew of any allergies. They do check covid vaccination cards here. Also, people were seated apart from other groups, which was great. The only downside is the price. It is slightly high for brunch but the food was good."

The bartender kept an eye out for us and asked us what we would like to drink while we waited. I had ordered The Durango which was delicious! Not spicy, not sweet but it had a nice smoky flavor due to the Mezcal.Our friends had arrived before we got our drinks, but the hostess was happy to grab them once they were made to bring them to the table. For dinner, we had ordered the Roasted Nova Scotia Halibut and the Half Main Lobster Bucatini. Both dishes were delicious, but we did think he halibut was a little dry (the fennel saffron sauce helped) and the creamy bisque sauce for the pasta was lacking cream.

Don't get me wrong, the restaurant wasn't bad, but it was just ok.Their menu is somewhat limited and they really don't have many options for people with allergies. I wish they had been able to accommodate my GF friend better. We had a few questions about the menu and it might have just been me but the server almost seemed a little frustrated with our questions. I also understand not being able to accommodate certain things, but I felt like we just kept hearing the word ""No"" a-lot which felt a little off-putting. As far as food, I ended up ordering/splitting the Dutch Baby pancake and the Fine Herb/Gruyere cheese omelette. Honestly, they were both just ok and a little bland. The omelette was a very small portion for $18. We also split the truffle fries, which were standard. The only food item I really thoroughly enjoyed was the house baked butter biscuits. These were light, fluffy and crispy. The accompanying butter was delicious as well. For drinks, I ended up with an espresso martini. It was ok, but I've definitely had better EM before. This was also had a dash of a citrus taste to it, which was interesting. My favorite part of this experience was how friendly the host (manager?) was to us. He was super personable and kind. The interior was cute, but nothing stand out. Overall, I think I would pass for a different spot in the area for brunch. Maybe dinner is a different story. 3.4/5"

She was told they would not add chicken to her pasta but that she would have to order a whole other entre for the chicken. It was weird but I get it, someplaces do not let you add things to the order. Weird but it's okay. The service was very bad. The manager did not seem to care that we were sitting down for almost an hour and talk to us. The waiter was very unpleasant and did not seem to care to accommodate us for anything really.

Outdoors, they've woven fake flowers around the scaffolding, so you kind of forget that you're sitting next to scaffolding!The cocktail menu offers lots of choices, both traditional as well as original. I enjoyed my Tea & Kalamansi, a bourbon based cocktail. I wish you could taste the ""tea"" a bit more, but the kalamansi was full and present and I really enjoyed that. We had the beef tartare to start, and it was SO lovely paired with a citrus dressed side salad. Perfect blend of savory with a nice splash of acid on the side.We shared our entrees- the lobster linguine and the smoked duck breast. While the lobster linguine was good, we felt the lobster was a bit overcooked (lost its crisp texture and was a bit mushy), though the sauce was really good and we loved the al dente linguine. The star of the night was the duck breast though. Holy smokes. It was cooked to perfection and the layer of skin and fat was a flavor parade in my mouth. Paired with the roasted peaches, the entire dish was just perfection. The mustard greens was a very interesting touch because it grounded the dish with its bitterness, but because I love the bitter taste, I thought it really worked.I'm still dreaming of that duck breast as I write this, 2 days later. The roasted artichokes is worth skipping, in my opinion. I like my artichoke seasoned on the sour side and felt this dish was too savory for my liking. Thank you for a wonderful date night, Atrium! We will definitely be back."

You grab a try and tongs and select whatever items you like.  Then when you get up to the register you can order drinks and they'll ring you up for everything.  We tried a fruit tart, a hashbrown pastry, and a tuna sandwich.  I also got a Matcha latte to drink.The fruit tart was light and fluffy and the fruit was fresh and not gummy.  The cream was light and delicious. The hashbrown pastry...I have no idea what was it it but it was creative and tasted great!  I think there may have been some kind of ham and egg in it?  Maybe similar to the flavor profile of a breakfast sandwich.  But it was a literal pastry...like a danish.  SO good.  The tuna was fresh and not too fishy and it had fresh crisp vegetables so that was refreshing.  The bread was a LITTLE soggy but not horrible considering.  All in all, enjoyed this snack!"

I am paying for a service and candidly didn't even need their wifi as I had a hot spot. I was scrambling to find somewhere to work whilst I eat and seeing that it was a cafe and that's the typical standard for cafes I made my way to Rosalia's. However my experience was not good. On top of that debacle I asked for a refund for my already placed food. Let that sink in I had already PAID for my food before even asking for the wifi. When I was told rather curtly no I requested a refund. A big thing about business is having flexibility with your CUSTOMERS . I was told that I would get the said ""refund"" in a few days or the charge will drop after I cancelled my order. Yet I was still charged. Service was friendly up until I politely asked for the wifi as I had not seen their ""sign of rules"". That I have a problem with because that means your hospitality is conditional. What if a mother walked in and wanted to quote down her kids by using a iPad or laptop to watch tv or play a game just expect them to March over and scold you about the rules. Once again weird. Your a cafe not five star dining it's off putting that you don't offer paying customers flexibility. It's real weird. I have been once before and everything was pleasant but I won't tolerate shitty service when I ask a question that your staff I guess doesn't like. My advice here is don't bring a laptop and don't even bother to ask about it because they are rude and honestly just don't go. Will not be going back ever again."

Roasted turkey with sausage stuffing and cranberry sauce in a wrap-sounds perfect, right? Well, here's the imperfection. There's no side sauce.  A wrap of this delicious magnitude demands some sort of warm gravy or au jus type of sauce for drizzling or dipping. My coffee was a bit weak but I'm also a robust bean lover.

Very friendly, has that ""I am calm despite the chaos"" demeanor. I'm in here fewer than like, a dozen times per year but it's nice knowing he's there. Makes me feel good about this giant expensive thing I'm bouta put in my mouth. [That's what she said!!!]* canceled for assuming age** canceled for assuming ethnicity*** canceled for assuming gender, a rare triple-play"

I'm not a fan of Chipotle's chicken, but this new chicken option looked better. It honestly tasted a lot better too. I would recommend it, but it would take a lot to make me stray from the steak. It's too good to give up. Every time I come here, even if it's only to buy a side of tomatoes or two, the person who is usually behind the counter is beyond sweet and has amazing people skills. I do look forward to coming to this location because I know that I will be greeted by a friendly employee and good food."
2161,FwPKY2uds5Wx2sj7fo6vHQ,3/6/2023,2 star rating,"I don't know why this location is consistently bad. My online orders are always missing an item or two, they never fill up the bowls and most of the time their chips are wildly burnt. Chipotle needs consistency across the board because this is frustrating. Not pictured: my missing drink and sauce."

She prepared it like I was a child and not a grown man. Absolutely pathetic servings, horrible customer service, the cashier sneezed without covering herself. Will never go back to this place again. Don't waste your time going either unless you have money to waste!!!! They should happy they even got one star!!!!"
2163,FwPKY2uds5Wx2sj7fo6vHQ,9/25/2022,1 star rating,"Continues to not impress. Has new menu items without any updated pricing. Scraping bottom of trays to get you proteins. Also, a first. Never seen 2 employees working around guests preparing their orders at the same time - Covid be damned. Pretty sure this is not part of their corporate training manual - if anybody from chipotle management is actually reading these reviews. Maybe something's wrong with me to keep visiting  this place. I need to find help (and better places to eat) - this is nyc after all. Maybe."
2164,FwPKY2uds5Wx2sj7fo6vHQ,7/25/2022,1 star rating,"Another Manhattan Chipotle, another dump, in my opinion. Post-Covid I've encountered this at each Manhattan location. - Just rude & nasty. It's clear that they are just there for a paycheck. Don't give a shi* about anything.- It was messy and out of stock of many items.- My visit included attitude from a cashier, counter person, and 'apprentice' bs manager. Asked a simple question in a nice tone about why multiple Chipotles seem to be out of a certain item. Cashier says one thing and then says, 'really I don't know'. In the line I figure I'd ask the manager. Cashier calls women over and I ask her thinking she's the manager that I asked for. She is rude, gives attitude, and the gem of a line, 'Well what don't you understand?' and 'Did he not tell you it was out of order?'. My response was no, he said something else. I even responded with a nice tone to try to calm things since she was upsetting people in the line and said, 'Why are you so mad? I went to the location at 34th last week and they were out too. I just wanted to know if this is a location issue or is this a NYC wide thing or shortage'. The 'apprentice' comes up and doesn't try to fix or take ownership. Doesn't answer the question and says, 'Bye, we're done with you. You can go.' and walks away. What a leader in training. To be clear, I'm no Karen, I had a simple question so that next time I'd go to a different location or stick with delivery - aka continue to be a loyal customer. K, long review is over...where's my cocktail? No longer giving money to that brand. Oh and 'shout out' to the miserable employees, Louis, Haylee, and cashier who wouldn't share his name. Winning!"

I dead ass got a bowl full of rice, pico, black beans and like 3 pieces of vegetables... 10000% would not have gotten chipotle tonight... and the guy who said they didnt expect to be out of guac by like 6pm???

My wife liked the taste and soft texture of the bun. For the main, I had the Pad Krapow, which is basil. The protein I picked was roasted chicken. The sauce got soaked up into the chicken, making it juicy and succulent. It had a kick of spice, which I loved. The ambiance is dope, a good date spot that's not too pricey. I'll be back."

2211,dzwa-zvkW6L2ZUGyNGrmuA,3/14/2023,3 star rating,"Small store down a set of stairs. I didn't even realize it was there, I was just looking for a dessert place to snack at after dinner. The inside is pretty small, there's a few tables and a long one side table. There was only one person working, who I think is the owner, which felt like it was not enough. Everything took a while for her to do since she had to do 50 things at once but she was doing it all with a smile and had a very cheery attitude. I got the strawberry later in a cup and the mango bingsu. The strawberry was in a long cup was very full and made it hard to eat. The flavor was a bit weak and didn't have enough milkiness to it since you couldn't mix anything together. Eating it completely individually layer by layer didn't make it as enjoyable as being able to mix it a bit. The mango bingsu was alright but nothing too special. It came with a little condensed milk to pour all over but I think it could do with a little more mango syrup.l to give it more flavor.I wish I went at a different time instead of after dinner bc I did want to try to toast. I might be back to try it since it seemed like a nice place and the owner seems like such a sweet person."
2212,dzwa-zvkW6L2ZUGyNGrmuA,3/10/2023,5 star rating,"Reasonably priced. Mango bingsu was good! I'm convinced its not real mangoes--probably canned. It was a perfect amount for two people. My friend and I got passion fruit green tea and lychee green tea. I looooved it. I don't like desserts or drinks that are overly sweet. Sweetory added the perfect amount of sweetness. The lychee green tea had a slight bitter taste that green tea normally has and I throughly enjoyed it. I just have to give credit for the employee working on a Friday night by herself. Busing tables, taking orders, making drinks and desserts, handling online orders, cleaning dishes, etc. customers kept rolling in but I saw how calm, professional and sweet she was to everyone that walked through the door. Someone actually left without paying and she ran out to chase after them lol. But she didn't make a huge scene to make anyone feel uncomfortable.I'll be happy to support this business again. **difficult area to find parking."

My friend and I were able to grab the seating by the window when we arrived around 10pm on a Saturday. As we decided what to order all the seats slowly filled up. We shared the Strawberry Bingsu, which we drizzled with condensed milk. It tasted good with fresh cut strawberries but it wasn't anything too special.

We ordered the lychee bingsu and the OD toast (pandan). The lychee bingsu was a disappointment (and what made me take off one star). It wasn't bad but I can easily find a better bingsu anywhere. The toast was the real winner. The outside was slightly crispy and the inside was warm, moist, and fluffy. The pandan wasn't overly sweet which I appreciated."
2215,dzwa-zvkW6L2ZUGyNGrmuA,2/22/2023,5 star rating,"One of my friends brought me here because it has great reviews. We had the pandan toast, the brown sugar milk tea, a mango slush, and the lychee bingsu. I love bingsu, but usually never order it because they always seem to come in such large portions. I love that they put the condensed milk on the side, as I tend to prefer the condensed milk on the lighter side. I have to admit that when it first came out I thought it looked a lot like sea scallops on a bed of ice, but it was so good, I can't believe we finished it all. There were so many lychee, and at the bottom they had the clear lychee jelly bubbles that burst."

Staff was very friendly and quick . But the lines my goodness ... but totally worth it . I tried going back yesterday but once I walked through those doors and I saw the line , I walked right back out . Maybe because it was Sunday and it was packed idk .

How can you be mad at the two employees handling so many customers??The ice cream is your standard cold stone creamery! Which is pretty awesome! If you've never been to one its the magical place where you get to create your own ice cream contraption by choosing a signature flavor... for me personally its the sweet cream and birthday cake that win over my heart and mix in any type of toppings from strawberries to crunch bar on a marble slab. Its pretty amazing as a late night unhealthy treat. They are located right outside the movie theater so its a good place to eat a sweet treat and not have to worry about parking. Its not the best seating inside so take the icecream elsewhere...They have about 5 tables inside. Overall the icecream is pretty awesome and creamy 5/5 for awesome icecream.Service, and decor are far beyond lacking...."

It's called HOT FOR COOKIES! From the picture it looked like if have trouble finishing it but it was more then I expected. After I parted the mountain of whip cream and chocolate pieces I finally got to the ice cream and 2 big chocolate chip cookies. The warm cookies went great with he cold ice cream.

Our favorite dishes are the chorizo nachos, fajitas, and of course steak burrito. Our server, Manuel, was fantastic and so kind. He was very knowledgeable about the food and his recommendations were spot on. We didn't get their names but the manager and maitre d' are also great.

So happy this place is still kicking, in a sea of boarded-up storefronts.We came here for lunch and we were really impressed. The decor is nice with indoor, outdoor and bar seating. We came here with a toddler which was ok because it was lunch and we had crayons. The waitress was EXTREMELY kind to our child, which I very much appreciated.On to lunch: $11 gets you a entree with a soup OR salad. Pete and I both chose the soup (tortilla soup). It didn't have chicken in it, but we liked it. Another table got salad and it looked like a delicious, generous portion.Pete chose the chicken burrito and I got the carnitas (pork) tacos. The tacos were amazing. They came with rice and beans. I asked for hot sauce and they made it sound like they had to ring it in and there would be a charge. I thought that was kind of odd then ultimately, they did not bring it so I can't tell you if it's good.We also ordered a side of fried plantains as an appetizer. They were served hot and crispy on the outside, mushy and sweet on the inside. We loved them!Pete ordered a San gria (for lunch... So lofty) it was sweet, which he loved. Had lots of fruit.I would definitely be back for the lively atmosphere, cool bar, delicious food and warm, welcoming service!"

Not a fan of the vegetarian tacos -- 4 tacos but the veggie proportions were not good, and it sucks that you can't mix-and-match (although there was only one vegetarian taco option). The veggie burrito (not on the presented dinner menu) was pretty good, but similar to the taco also had poor veggie proportions (too much corn, too little other veggies). Didn't try it but $26 is too much for a mojito."

Pricing as with US Starbucks and NYC (both tend to be high) go hand in hand - my drink after tax came to $6.48, this would also be the price of the regular version or PSL which costs around 1.6 dollars more when converted here, compared to back home.2* - Drink was just okay in not very comfortable surroundings and many other nearby branches just a block or two away are larger and more welcoming in size, features and service. This branch probably deserves the title of ""Worst Spelling of the name Aaron"", even the barista making my drink looked at confusion and laughter as she had to shout out ""Salin"" - now I thought ""Simon"" or ""Alvin"" couldn't get any worse!"

I recently had one of the most unpleasant experiences in the Starbucks location on 1st Avenue between 53rd and 54th in NYC.Let me note that I work a few short blocks away and visit this location DAILY. I spend quite a lot of money for Starbucks each week. I place mobile orders frequently for myself and my coworkers. On Nov 27th; I placed my mobile order way ahead of the time I arrived at the location. My order was 20 dollars , so it wasn't cheap. The store was completely packed with majority of the customers waiting for their mobile orders for over 30 minutes. The same was true for me. The employees did not seem to care much, in fact they were completely rude and dismissive, as they continued laughing and chatting amongst each other as opposed to tending to the customers that have been waiting a long time. One of the girls that was making hot drinks only decided to tell me that if I didn't want to wait, I could take myself to the line to wait for a refund. That is just unacceptable and disrespectful. I asked to speak to the manager, who apparently was nowhere to be found so instead I spoke to the ""shift supervisor in training"" who clearly was not being trained by anyone and instead insisted that they all knew what they were doing and they were backed up. Once my drinks were finally sloppily slammed on the counter in front of me, they were both incorrect! My venti iced drink was made hot, and the customizations that I paid for in my drink were completely disregarded , as well as my friends drink, missing sweet cream cold foam when it was clearly printed on the label. How is there no manager on duty? How are there all new employees during the busiest time of the season without anyone taking charge and organizing the operation? Spending money on coffee and food at Starbucks should not feel like a burden and turn into a back and fourth with the employees. But that is what it seems to be now, because there is no quality control and the customer service just does not exist. This is not the first time that this location specifically has made me reconsider doing business elsewhere, as there are a few other coffee shops in the neighborhood that I will go to instead because this was the last straw."

Pricing as with US Starbucks and NYC (both tend to be high) go hand in hand - my drink after tax came to $6.48, this would also be the price of the regular version or PSL which costs around 1.6 dollars more when converted here, compared to back home.2* - Drink was just okay in not very comfortable surroundings and many other nearby branches just a block or two away are larger and more welcoming in size, features and service.

I recently had one of the most unpleasant experiences in the Starbucks location on 1st Avenue between 53rd and 54th in NYC.Let me note that I work a few short blocks away and visit this location DAILY. I spend quite a lot of money for Starbucks each week. I place mobile orders frequently for myself and my coworkers. On Nov 27th; I placed my mobile order way ahead of the time I arrived at the location. My order was 20 dollars , so it wasn't cheap. The store was completely packed with majority of the customers waiting for their mobile orders for over 30 minutes. The same was true for me. The employees did not seem to care much, in fact they were completely rude and dismissive, as they continued laughing and chatting amongst each other as opposed to tending to the customers that have been waiting a long time. One of the girls that was making hot drinks only decided to tell me that if I didn't want to wait, I could take myself to the line to wait for a refund. That is just unacceptable and disrespectful. I asked to speak to the manager, who apparently was nowhere to be found so instead I spoke to the ""shift supervisor in training"" who clearly was not being trained by anyone and instead insisted that they all knew what they were doing and they were backed up. Once my drinks were finally sloppily slammed on the counter in front of me, they were both incorrect! My venti iced drink was made hot, and the customizations that I paid for in my drink were completely disregarded , as well as my friends drink, missing sweet cream cold foam when it was clearly printed on the label. How is there no manager on duty? How are there all new employees during the busiest time of the season without anyone taking charge and organizing the operation? Spending money on coffee and food at Starbucks should not feel like a burden and turn into a back and fourth with the employees.

In fact, the tall cashier w kind eyes (aka Juicy Jalen) patiently advised me while taking into consideration each new criteria I threw in to the mix.

They have an ample amount of outdoor seating, and there is a welcoming and casual vibe to the place that makes it very appealing. If you are looking for a great breakfast sandwich, then go with the Carny Breakfast (which includes scrambled eggs, cheddar, and bacon on a brioche bun). I also liked their lemon ricotta biscuit, which had a nice balance of sweet and citrus flavor. The rosewater lemonade is a refreshingly floral beverage, and their coffee is also solid. I am eager to try more of their menu when I visit again."
2300,wXiIxbnFRaFBS9RI4wJrdw,3/26/2023,5 star rating,Obsessed with this place. So underrated. Great service and easy to walk in to even for a Saturday brunch. Lattes were sooo amazing. Great level of sweetness. The bowls were awesome. Such great quality ingredients (the avocado was perfect and the brisket was just the right amount of fatty). And the lemon ricotta biscuit was more like a muffin but perfect moist texture almost creamy. Obsessed. Can't wait to go back and try the other larger location in Williamsburg too.
2301,wXiIxbnFRaFBS9RI4wJrdw,12/19/2022,5 star rating,Had a really great to-go lunch from Baba Cool! Their menu is so creative and unique and vegetarian-friendly. I got the Jo Bowl and a matcha latte and both were fantastic. The Jo Bowl has so many fresh ingredients and I love how vegetables are the star. I wouldn't say it was the most flavorful dish I've ever had but it definitely felt very clean and satisfying. We came during Monday lunch rush and still got our food within a reasonable amount of time. Would love to come back and try some more of their menu items!
2302,wXiIxbnFRaFBS9RI4wJrdw,6/19/2022,4 star rating,"Delicious breakfast spot! Very limited outside seating for dine-in. We waited about 15 minutes to sit down on a Saturday. The drinks and food were heavenly!! I had the baba bowl, cold brew, and toast with jam. The baba bowl dressing was to die for - they must use angel tears  I am really going to try hard to recreate it. It was so fresh and filling, exactly what I needed. The toast was not what I was expecting. It was fluffy and triangle-shaped, not like the wonder bread you'd get at a diner. My partner had the chia pudding bowl, which was also heavenly. Some of the most photogenic food I've ever seen!! I'm knocking a star off of this place just because of the slow service. We allowed an hour and 15 minutes to eat, and took that whole time. Only one person was taking orders, so it made sense. I know times are hard with staffing, and that made our experience just more rushed than we would have liked. If you have time, this place is really worth it though!"
2303,wXiIxbnFRaFBS9RI4wJrdw,9/18/2022,4 star rating,The Jo Bowl was good with a lot of different flavors in each of the components. There's a fair amount of outdoor seating (no indoors) that make it a really nice place to sit and enjoy a meal or coffee.

I really don't feel there are enough healthy bowl/salad spots (no Sweetgreen, no Dig Inn) within walking distance from me and even Baba Cool is like a mile and a half walk, but definitely worth it. The service is friendly and the place was definitely busy! You can tell it's very popular. They have outdoor seating with heaters although the tables don't all feel 6ft away (some do but some felt like they were pushing it a little). I ordered the raw cacao latte which was tasty and the Jo Bowl where I loved the ingredients. They felt healthy and of a good quality, and the beans and plantains were the highlight for me. I would certainly order it again but the menu had a lot on it I wanted to try. I'll definitely update when I try more."

The food items all looked delicious though I went with the chai latte which was super. They have options of almond and oat milk too for non-dairy preferences out there. Easily stayed for 2 hours without being rushed to leave which is a rarity in the city!

I am very glad we did. The lighting is this very cool dim red, giving the whole place this warm neon glow. The drinks, while very pricey in comparison, were well made and delicious. The things that really made the difference for us: The bouncer is really nice and has a super interesting personality, and he is very fun to engage with throughout the night. Last night the playlist was awesome and while many of the songs where not related by genre they were exactly what we needed to hear, and we showed it by singing along at our table. The best part was we were not alone in this, as the man next to us, the bouncer, and the bartender joined us at several points across the evening. Also, we had a blast playing jenga at our table, and learned that we all get competitive a few drinks in. What a good way to start our night!"

We ordered a bunch of drinks and had a great time mingling with everyone.The Little Whiskey also serves up some tasty grilled cheese sandwiches to fill all those drunken cravings.

2314,Y9ZC2tx4ReQqA40LEPErwQ,11/23/2015,1 star rating,"It's a bro-bar, through and through.  Sideways baseball hats, popped collars, tight fitted shirts, it's all there, even if it has a suspenders and handlebar moustache glamor put over it by  michevous faerie folk.  Either this vibe will make you feel at home, or make your skin crawl.$10 for a beer and a shot, when every single other bar in the neighborhood will get you the same deal for at least four bucks cheaper. Two TV's in a bar this size is distracting and annoying. Eventually they'll expand and maybe that will no longer be the case, but for now, you have two televisions showing different games crammed into a bar designed for none. Too much, Little Whiskey. Too much. And for people who are happy to finally have a bar in the neighborhood that has televisions, may I please refer you to Old Stanley's, Central Station, Eastlands, PineBox Rock Shop, Sweet Science, 983, and even Birchwood. They have a selection of Whiskey, just like every other bar that has whiskey. This is not a selling point for a bar, it is the definition of bars. They don't have anything I haven't found at other places, though they do have more than your average amount.  Bulleit's running for $12 here for a neat pour.  Other places in the neighborhood you can get that for about $8 Maybe $10. But here? $12. Why they have to charge so much when the owners are their own landlords, i don't know. I guess they just assume people will fall for it. Oh, the red ""Little Whiskey"" sign in the fireplace area may confuse some into thinking they are in a boring strip club.  Fortunately there is an equally gaudy ""BAR"" sign out front to clear things up, in case you are a moron or just enjoy living in bad cartoon. Either you will like this place, or you won't. Either you care about how shady the owners are, or you don't. But the fact is this place is an overpriced franchise bar that is the opposite of what Bushwick is about, painted to look like what you expect Bushwick to be.  Did you know that realtors in this neighborhood purposefully leave garbage around on the street, so when showing places to newcomers, it looks like they're getting the ""authentic Bushwick experience."" That is a fact. And that is also a perfect metaphor for the Little Whiskey."
2315,Y9ZC2tx4ReQqA40LEPErwQ,12/15/2019,2 star rating,"Brooklyn. A place that screams culture and discretion, surprisingly for most, I have called this place where I live over a decade, home and comfort, has exceeded my expectations. I have been to many places in Brooklyn and it has been nothing more than accommodating and brings out the joy of life, in unity of soul and spirit. Disgustingly to say, the joy that I felt about Brooklyn has been turned around to depression and hostility in my final hours in The Little Whiskey. We walked in around 2:10 am on a Saturday night, during the robust peak hours of the city that never sleeps and all was fulfilling. Drinks, nice bartender, chattering, laughing, and sharing stories of our mundane lives with contempt and satisfaction. 3:45 am arrives and the bouncer came over to our table with an attitude in a hasty tone of voice that , ""We are closing in fifteen minutes, this is the last call."". Understanding that tone of voice as well as the need to abide by the law of the 4:00 am cut off period on alcohol, we ordered our final drink.This is when things get awkward. After we ordered our final drinks I personally decided to go outside and have a cigarette to satisfy my despicable addiction. As I made my way to the door, three more guests asked to come in, and the bouncer agreed. I came back and noticed that our drinks were at the table. So, I sat down and looked forward to finish my final drink of the night. Took two sips of my tequila with lime and grapefruit, then the bouncer rushed over with haste, not ask, but demanded us to leave. I replied, ""But, at least allow us to finish the drink that we ordered."". He replied with authority, ""Don't argue with me. No! you must leave right now!."". I answered, "" But our drinks just arrived, at least let us finish our drinks."". He refused to hear us nor contemplate on the situation and kicked us out in a rude manner. My party and I may not be the perfect patrons, but we are certainly polite and easy going. Being in the service industry for over a decade in NYC perhaps what should be done is to do last call earlier than fifteen minutes prior to closing instead of demanding your patrons to leave. We feel robbed, mistreated, and tricked into ordering our last drinks only to get kicked out before we could finish. Furthermore, as we left, there were still people at the bar including the people that the bouncer let in around 3:45 am. So, whats that about?Deducted from this experience, it's an unfair treatment with rude bouncer, selective, and money grabbing at the final hours of The Little Whiskey. I apologize for the cynicism, however, what happened here tonight explains itself by the business practice they enforce. I'd personally refrain from coming here towards the end of the night, and save yourself from hostility. We all deserve better."

We had most of the restaurant, with a few regular diners outside. They prepared a lot of little appetizers to get us started, and when we all sat down for lunch, promptly took our orders. Since I have a few allergies, they were easily able to accommodate an already set menu. From delicious salads, to salmon, to dessert, everything was amazing. They constantly kept everyone's drinks full, and were very attentive. I loved the salmon, it was cooked to perfection. Everyone absolutely devoured the tiramisu. Make sure you stop by, next time you're in the area!"

They have a good list of staples on the menu and everything from the chairs and decor to the service matches that vibe. To me both the food and the liquor situation were disappointing. They don't have a cocktail list, and when we asked for one they just said ""we have a full bar, can make anything."" For beer, they have two beers - Amstel Light and Pilsner Urquell. For food we started with a Caprese, which was extremely forgettable. Thick sliced semi-ripe tomato with supermarket grade mozzarella on top.  I had the gnocchi for dinner. The gnocchi were pillowy and delightful, but the cream sauce was largely without flavor and the dish was overall disappointing.

2329,qEbQbYZxurnuVxDrNHQUJg,1/29/2023,4 star rating,"Tight! Tight! Tight! If this review were based strictly on the food, five stars, no question. However, the restaurant is steps away from Lincoln Center. We went pre-ballet and the restaurant was packed like a sardine tin. My chair was literally out into the only pathway to the kitchen and the bathrooms. I was bumped into probably 50 times. If I were in a bar and that happened I would probably have punched someone but, of course, I couldn't do that to the pre-ballet crowd. Someone would break a hip. The service was swift but certainly uninspired. We poured our own wine, which is something that annoys me. The server was friendly but a bit non-existent. On the other hand... the food! Ooh La La, tres bonne.! My wife started with the beet salad which was perfectly dressed, beautifully composed and absolutely delicious. My appetizer was the homemade pate which was rich but subtle and nicely plated with a little frisee salad, cornichons and pickeled pearl oniions. As an entree I had a seafood crepe that was a little mesy but a perfect balance of sweet and salty. My wife had the chicken scaloppini that was to die for. For dessert we shared one of the best chocolate mousses I've ever eaten. It was super light, but rich, which is a hard thing to do.The price point was very fair, especially for a restaurant in Manhattan.Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant but would suggest that you go later than 8:00 to avoid the pre-Lincoln center rush."
2330,qEbQbYZxurnuVxDrNHQUJg,7/17/2022,1 star rating,"--------FOOD SAFETY ISSUE!! --------Do not come here!!My parents visited La Boite en Bois last weekend and found a steel nail/screw in their food. Yes, a nail!! The waiter/kitchen admitted the nail was from their kitchen. It is scary to think my parents could've been hurt from eating that entree. Imagine if they just bit into the food without looking closer. The restaurant merely provided two free steak entrees (worth ~$90) which is far from compensating for the poor experience and trauma experienced. The restaurant is extremely lucky they did not eat the nail, otherwise it would obviously be lawsuit worthy. Anyone could have just scooped up a bite without looking. Imagine an elderly person, a kid, or anyone just eating their food normally could have been sent to the hospital immediately.There really does not need to be any more said here. They clearly did not provide sufficient compensation or remorse.Service was well below average for a restaurant that is supposed to be somewhat nice. They did not do anything unless called up on or asked. No bread or even plates / silverware with the bread and no water refills unless asked."

2333,qEbQbYZxurnuVxDrNHQUJg,4/25/2022,2 star rating,"Typically I like to leave even keeled reviews about establishments. And for La Boite en Bois, I will do my best. I ordered delivery for the first time, so we'll put my review through that lens. As far as I'm concerned, there are three aspects to delivery, the food, the delivery service itself, and in the event of a problem, the customer service. Let's begin with delivery - On time. Hot. No complaints.So, let's *really* begin with the food - it's good. I've eaten at this place in-person before. The restaurant is cute, and it's serves classic French cuisine. It's not fancy food, it's solid bistro fare. The kind of stuff that you would pop-in locally and if you were in Paris, is as much about the people watching as it was about the food. We ordered a pasta dish (I know, not French) which was tasty and handsomely adorned with a ton of seafood. The value was there. The flavors were there. The aroma was a tad seafoody, but it didn't translate to the flavor. We also ordered a burger, which arrived done-to-order, and the sautéed onions really enhanced the thing.  The fries were not good. I assume they were frozen at some point. They lacked body and were anemic in color.Finally we received the roast chicken. Well seasoned, still moist on delivery. It was a no-frills classic prep, and overall pretty darned good. Notice I said ""received."" - It's not what we ordered. So onto customer service.Delivery mistakes happen all the time. You order A and you get B. And typically, you call up the restaurant and you either get refunded the difference between the two dishes, or they'll send over a new one. With the amount of volume that restaurants do, seems like it's a quick problem to solve to any customer's satisfaction.  Unfortunately, at La Boite en Bois, that wasn't the case. When we called to get the problem remedied, instead of taking me at my word (a.k.a. the customer), apparently the Kitchen and Packer were ""100% positive that they prepared and delivered the right thing."" For what it's worth I ordered the Roast Duck Dinner, a $14 dollar difference to the Roast Chicken. In marketing, there's a thing called the ""Cost Per Acquisition."" And that's how much a company is willing to spend to get a new customer. So keep in mind that in this case, the CPA is $14. Obtuse, the Kitchen and Packer (communicating through the server, who is now acting as ombudsperson), were basically calling me, the customer, a liar. It's an interesting strategy. Let's see if it pays off. The hoop they wanted me to jump through was to send them a photo of the chicken. Only after they suggested that I was trying to get a free meal. I remind you that the difference was $14. A simple refund. But ooooooookay......Still annoyed, I sent the photo of the chicken. Good news everyone. They confirmed that it was, in fact, chicken.  Phew. I promptly got a call from the server informing me that they would refund me for the entire dish (the duck which I paid for, not the chicken).  I'm satisfied with the refund. It's appropriate. But what about the chef? The expediter? Surely they don't care, but do they still feel 100% confident that they prepped the right thing? 100% that they packed the right thing? I dunno folks, that confidence should probably be kicked back to 99%. Not to get too philosophical, but if you'll afford me the tangent, this is the problem in dealing with absolutes:  You shouldn't be 100% sure of anything, unless it's demonstrable and repeatable - like the scientific method. And even then, would you stake $14 on your reputation. So to that end, let's talk in absolutes. I'm 100% sure that the restaurant doesn't really want to lose a customer over $14. I'm also 100% sure that they don't want me to have this story to tell my friends in the neighborhood. You know, when we're walking by, or if we're just hanging out talking about places to order dinner from.I'm 100% sure that the entire nonsense could have been avoided by some consideration to the veracity of the customers. I'm 100% sure that I can tell the difference between chicken and duck.And because I don't like dealing with absolutes, I'm 99% sure I won't be back. So if you want the scores:3.5 stars for food5 stars for delivery1 star for customer service5 stars for the story"

Wait staff consistently presented the wrong meal to the wrong person.  Service was agonizingly slow and inattentive.  No attempt was made to clean the table between courses.  Wait staff switched halfway through meal.  The restaurant was overcrowded and I will never forget the waiter clearing a neighboring table using a stake knife to roll muscle shells onto a plate.  Not fine dining."

The noodles themselves were meh (i ordered mine wavy & al dente). Beyond the broth, another unique aspect was that they had 3 different types of proteins that helped keep the meal interesting!Octo wasabi: $7, i ordered this knowing that there was a high chance i was gonna be iffy about it but wanted to try something i otherwise would never have.

I also tried to reach out here or on IG, the message button doesn't work on IG...Anyway, if the manager of this location see this, can you please reach out. I love Totto but I just want to share that out of the few times I had dinner there for the past 2 months, twice I threw up within 6 hrs after I consume the ramen. The first time I thought I caught a stomach bug. But twice...i don't know. The other times I was fine. So hopefully management can do a thorough check of the inventory if there's a bad batch. Isn't sometime last year Woodear mushroom was recalled by one of the major company? I don't remember much ramen place serve woodear mushroom anymore. I would like to come back. I have been dining there since it first opened."

Toto ramen makes their stock with a lot of chicken  bones ( love that Japanese concept of motennai - sorrow of wasting things). So they made a broth that is so flavorful , but light and not like some other places that make their tonkotsu thicker ( and that's not a bad thing). But Toto got it right and their noodles and toppings are first rate. Just like japan, expect to wait on line for seats at this small place. And just like Japan, the long lines are always worth the wait. You won't be disappointed."

The chicken nuggets weren't crispy, they were soft. The chicken strips were really thin and a tad bit over done, kinda like chicken fries from Burger King. Cheese curly fries had no crunch, soggy and extremely salty. Banana pudding tasted like purfumed pudding and was off putting. Coleslaw looked decent enough but it was ordered for my mom, so I didn't try it. Lastly, the only good item in this order... mozzarella sticks and the marinara sauce it came with - perfect! It's got a good herb mix that I just can't have enough of. For an order which cost me $50+ (tips included), it's disappointing and left much to be desired"

I asked the gentleman before making my order, if the tax would apply if I used my card. He didn't answer but continued to make the 10 piece order. I asked him again if there would be tax charged before he made the order, and after he packed the chicken, he told me he would be charging me tax. Keep in mind this was no specific order, the chicken was premade and under the heat lamp. I told him no thank you, I don't want the order if there would be tax for using my card, especially if it would be $10 straight if I paid in cash. The gentleman banged on the window to get my attention and then told me he would not charge tax. Once I got back in the store, I gave him my card and he then said he would in fact charge me tax. I told him that wasn't what we agreed on, then he refused to give me my card. This went on for over 20 minutes, even calling the police because he refused to give me my card, and the other patrons either had stories where he did this before or they wanted to know why my card wasn't given back to me. I even signed the receipt just to get my card back because he swiped my card when I specifically said I no longer wanted the order. So I wouldn't be late to get my daughter, or later, as I was already 20 minutes late, I considered canceling my card and getting a new one. After 40 minutes of this, he finally gave me my card back and said he was giving it since I was running late, as if he was doing me a favor when he was the problem. I will still be contacting everyone necessary to make sure this is the last time this practice is done at this location. How dare you hold someone's card hostage and charge them what they dont agree on paying. First and last time in this establishment."

New favorites: the sticky rice in lotus leaf (I never had lotus leaf before; it has a beautiful toasty tea aroma), the half moon pockets (succulent steamed dough bursting with fresh crunchy veggies and cilantro), and the deliciously savory ""treasure balls with assorted flavor.""We're so obsessed with the dim sum that we haven't had much of the regular menu yet - but we will come back!"

I ate Chinese food the first 20 years of my life but I can no longer eat soy or gluten and it's been impossible to find Chinese food that I can be sure I wouldnt have a reaction to.... until today!!! Our waitress was sooooo special and made sure I knew exactly what dishes I could and couldn't have and reminded me as she brought each out. They were able to do dishes with garlic sauce and totally avoid soy sauce, oyster sauce, etc. Many of them naturally didn't have gluten. I'd say all of the mushroom ones were awesome that we tried. My favorite was the rice noodle mushroom curry!! The curry was delicate and delicious. And loved the Hot chili oil on the side. No stomach or headaches, only wonderful flavors and great service. Excited to go back with my celiac dad."
2361,rGmGim1ZDCxnF8n4NiKrYQ,9/11/2021,3 star rating,"It pains me to write this review, because after 12 years of loyalty, I am officially breaking up with Vegetarian Dim Sum House. They are the oldest plant based restaurant in NYC's Chinatown, and for over a decade, the go-to group dinner spot for my friends and I. Sadly, our recent meal will be my last here. The restaurant is dimly lit, with a sparse, charmingly mismatched interior that has not been updated since the 80's. The menu is extensive, offering somewhere near a hundred different entirely vegan dim sum options. Name a mock meat, they've got it-pork, chicken, shrimp, even shark fin. Beer is not on the menu, but they keep the Tsingtao flowing if you ask nicely. On a Monday night, my group of 7 friends were the only patrons here. We ordered ~$200 of dim sum, which ended up being enough to feed 12 people. No matter, this is the fun of dim sum. Order and try a ton of different things, and even if you end up with a few lemons, there will still be plenty of dishes you like. We ordered all our usual go-to's. Pork Buns, Treasure Balls, Shrimp Dumplings, Rice Flour Rolls, and a dozen other wild cards. Sadly, the food quality has majorly declined since my last visit. We needed to add ample soy sauce and chili paste to everything, to make it taste like anything except glutinous soy flour, bland mock meat, and oil. Everything was incredibly one-note, void of flavor and complexity. While Vegetarian Dim Sum House will always have a special place in my heart, I can no longer recommend them."

We were incredibly excited at the idea of vegetarian dim sum, but we ordered four dishes and, after tasting each, left it all and wound up going out for dinner a second time since we couldn't imagine eating what we were served. Textures were horrid, food was oily and excessively sweet. Save your money and go somewhere else. We regret having visited."

The food was great, although the mock meat is very obviously not meat (if you're looking for mock meat that resembles real meat, this is not the place). It's very clear that there are vegetables and no meat here. The prices are affordable, and my friend and I even had leftovers after. It's more of a hole-in-the-wall place, so don't expect any fancy decor or stellar service (if you need something, like a hot tea refill, you need to ask). Ironically, it wasn't my vegan friend who took me here, so I definitely need to show my vegan friends this spot!"

The perfect place for all vegans and vegetarians to enjoy but the quality of the food really disappointed me. I thought the issue would be how the mock meat wouldn't be able to compare but that part was more or less okay. The issue was the actual dumplings and rice roll. They were overcooked and slimy and tasted like bad water. All the already vegetarian items sucked. I tried the mushroom rice rolls and there was barely any filling. The mock pork buns had an odd texture. The fried dough was tough and probably stale. The cold sesame noodles were especially bad as it was just peanut butter and nothing else (you could see the clumps). The sticky rice was my favorite thing but I wished it had mock sausage in it like the real thing. The place is cash only but they have an ATM inside ($4 convenience fee). The food itself wasn't exactly cheap, around the same or higher price as regular dim sum. I feel like if you have diet restrictions, you're better off going to a quality place and sticking to whatever the options are there. The bathroom was really dirty and cluttered with cleaning supplies and boxes. The service was good."

It was good, not the best i had but it did hit the spot. I also had a carnitas taco. The carnitas could have had more seasoning. I also tasted my boyfriends chicken and bistec (steak) taco. Completely dry. It was tasty but as i mentioned their food tends to be a little dry. So if you don't mind adding lemon to your food, then it's a go for. =)"

It's extremely tiny, so landing a seat is definitely a gamble. Cocktail: ordered the Cucumber and it was delicious. Note: the waiter will ask for your preferred spice level from a 1-10 -- I ordered a 3 and the drink was pretty spicy (I have a high tolerance for spice too). Nevertheless, it was one of the best spicy cocktails I've had.Food: for starters, we ordered the fried chicken, which was alright. I'm not a fan of chicken thighs, let alone boneless, so that may be it. For ramen, I ordered the Kyoto, which I really enjoyed. The broth was light and the flavors were pretty good. Nothing mind blowing, but did it's job. Definitely think it's a spot worth checking out-- the cocktails are bomb, service is good, and food is a solid 3.5."

The restaurant has a cozy, intimate atmosphere that was perfect for a romantic evening. The food was absolutely delicious - I had the soupless bone marrow and wagyu which was packed with savory umami flavors. My date had the Sapporo ramen which was equally delicious. The service was prompt and attentive, and the cocktails were a highlight. I highly recommend the pineapple passion fruit cocktail for a sweet and fruity drink. The prices were also very reasonable for the quality of food and drinks we received. Overall, ROKC is a fantastic spot for a date night and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious and intimate dining experience."

It's located in West Harlem which is a long ways away if you're coming from Manhattan but I made the trip north anyway. I wanted to go through a tasting of their clarified cocktails to know just how the professionals do them. My first drink was the bee + chamomile ($15) which was sweet, easy to drink, and had big chamomile notes. My second drink was the smokey pineapple ($15) which was mezcal forward but slightly sweet from the pineapple. My third drink was the lemon & lemongrass ($15) which was bright from the lemon and also easy to drink. For food I ordered the pork bun ($6) which was really good as well and I liked the tartar sauce.All of the clarified drinks were so downable and much more complex and delicious than anything I've made at home. One funny interaction I had with the server: I ordered my third drink and he replied, ""Wow you're making your way through the clarified drinks"". Also I recently found out that ROKC was opened by vets from the bar Angel's Share which just adds to the reasons why this place is so great. I'm sure all of their other food and drinks are amazing too but their clarified cocktails are top-notch."

They mostly have outdoor seating at the moment because of Covid. But they have a lot of space inside as well. The space inside is laid out like a mini food court where you have a variety of options of items to choose from for breakfast or brunch.

2400,j1lE04LqafT-t42AxhC-MQ,7/29/2022,5 star rating,Been coming here for a while really good food and  great environment. If you want to bring your friends and family or just by yourself this is the spot.
2401,j1lE04LqafT-t42AxhC-MQ,5/7/2022,3 star rating,So I came here on Cinco de Mayo so that should be taken into account when reading this. We got there pretty early around 5 right before things got a bit hectic. I was sitting for maybe 15 minutes before anyone came by to greet me or see if I needed any help. I got tacos which were tasty. My sister got chicken nachos which she felt could have been better. When the food came we still hadn't gotten utensils and we never got water for the table. Our server switched after we got our food and she was a lot more helpful. But my sisters last margarita took a while to get to the table and in the middle of her drinking it we were told they needed the table. She was able to get a Togo cup but it was a bit rude.
2402,j1lE04LqafT-t42AxhC-MQ,4/16/2022,4 star rating,"This place was welcoming and spacious and filled with the rancheras of Vicente Fernandez one recent morning. The food was delicious, maybe a little on the higher end of pricing for a lunch meal. I would return to it, though, and sample more dishes."
2403,j1lE04LqafT-t42AxhC-MQ,2/9/2022,3 star rating,Did not have the best experience here. We went for a birthday celebration as a group of adult women and tried to order drinks but they turned us down. (Disappointing since it was a large group of us). I ordered the steak tacos the Mexican way which were good but they were EXTREMELY DRY and had way too much cilantro on them like there was more cilantro than steak. Everyone else said their food tasted good but we were all very disappointed that they said they couldn't serve us when we are all of age.
2404,j1lE04LqafT-t42AxhC-MQ,4/22/2022,5 star rating,A bit overpriced but worth the the tender and flavorful steak adobo.If you're picky about your 'Rita's this is the place for it.
2405,j1lE04LqafT-t42AxhC-MQ,1/14/2021,5 star rating,This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. All the food is very authentic. The seafood soup was the best. And the prices are great.
2406,j1lE04LqafT-t42AxhC-MQ,10/18/2018,3 star rating,Santa Fe is pretty okay. It's fine for a Mexican place in Riverdale. There's not that many good food options in the area. It gets to be slow. This is even when no other customers are there. I had the regular size margarita. It's about $8 and is fairly big. This definitely had alcohol in it. Frozen version was very good. This was thirst quenching after walking around Van Cortlandt Park. I had the vegetable burrito. This is about $10 and is massive. I found it okay but nothing was incredible. The margarita was okay but still average. The burrito was big but tasted like many others.
2407,N4Pss0mR4ygDOoSRpM2FQA,1/25/2023,5 star rating,"A lot of New Yorkers will swear to you that Culture's chocolate chip cookies are the best in the city. Though I am admittedly a skeptic by nature, I can't disagree. The chocolate chip cookies are fantastic. They are crispy, buttery, and absolutely loaded with chocolate chips. We can tomayto, tomahto (it's tomato) all day about which cookie is actually the best. This is New York and ""Best Cookie"" is a crowded field. There are so many delicious contenders. But this cookie deserves to be part of the conversation. As far as the overall experience, Culture is cool. It can be a bit crowded and noisy. I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work or read. I think it's best experienced via a quick pop-in. When you do, just make sure you don't pop out without a cookie."
2408,N4Pss0mR4ygDOoSRpM2FQA,3/5/2023,4 star rating,"// SummaryDecent espresso drinks with great quality and speedy service, but hopefully you'll be luckier than me to secure one of their highly-esteemed cookies.// ExperienceI've usually ordered an americano here, and have never been disappointed. It's pretty smooth and had a good earthiness to it, but nothing particularly special. I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have cookies on any of the occasions that I've been there, but c'est la vie. // ServiceThere hasn't ever really been much of a line every time I've come here, so I get served relatively quickly and things come out in a jiffy. // AmbianceAs with most NYC coffee shops, this is relatively small, but they do got maybe 2-3 tables you can sit at if you're lucky along with a bar. Not much else to say about their vibe, but it's nice and simple. // ConveniencePretty close to Bryant Park, and it's a great stop to get caffeinated with some good quality espresso."
2409,N4Pss0mR4ygDOoSRpM2FQA,3/4/2023,3 star rating,"I was in the neighborhood and had to try their award winning chocolate chip cookie. I understand the hype of the cookie, but it wasn't for me. The cookie had so many chocolate chunks, and it was super crispy crunchy on the outside. However, it was just too sweet for me. I did have a flat white to wash down the sweetness, but the coffee had a weird celery taste. I'm not sure why. It was off putting.There were plenty of seats that day, and there is free wifi, so I was able to get some work done. However, there are no bathrooms or outlets."
2410,N4Pss0mR4ygDOoSRpM2FQA,2/24/2023,4 star rating,"Had decaf cappuccino and a three berry muffin - berries still moist inside the soft muffin. Sign said ""award winning cookies"" and their peanut butter cookie was very good. $4.50 each. 3 small tables seats 2-3 people and a couple of tall tables - in the middle and by the window. Got pretty crowded, but lucky we got one of the smaller tables. Fast service."
2411,N4Pss0mR4ygDOoSRpM2FQA,3/12/2023,4 star rating,Convenient espresso shop near Bryant Park. My flat white was pretty good. The cookies looked good on display. Limited seating and merch. I wish they had some seasonal or specialty drinks on the menu.
2412,N4Pss0mR4ygDOoSRpM2FQA,1/24/2023,3 star rating,"I enjoyed this place.Decent coffee. However, I think I have had better coffee. It did not blow me away. I really enjoyed the cookies. Reminds me of the cookies at Specialty's in the Bay Area. Thick and chunky.This place is like a 3.5. I'll put it in the 3 category. Pretty convenient if you're near the Empire State Building. Sorry for the ugly photo. I was lazy and did not take photos when I bought. Took photo once I put the cookies in my ziplock bag."
2413,N4Pss0mR4ygDOoSRpM2FQA,2/24/2023,5 star rating,"4.5 stars - Really good, really quick, and nice inside. Interior is small but it is aesthetic, the staff was very friendly and were very quick and accurate when making drinks, and the taste of the coffee was way better than your typical Starbucks or Dunkin. It's not my absolute favorite coffee shop in the area, but is definitely up there (top 5) and would definitely come back here again."
2414,N4Pss0mR4ygDOoSRpM2FQA,2/7/2023,4 star rating,Had a great decaf americano. Love that there's a vegan option but it's banana bread - not ideal LOL but cool for people who like banana bread. Would love to see them veganize their award-winning cookies! My sister got the gluten free peanut butter cookie and said it was divine. Ambiance is cute and they have non dairy milk on the bar so you don't need to pay extra for a splash. Love to see this and hope other coffee shops follow suite!
2415,N4Pss0mR4ygDOoSRpM2FQA,3/2/2023,2 star rating,"Came here to get the chocolate chip cookie that was on several lists for best cookie in New York. Service was fast since the cookie was just sitting there on the counter on display but unfortunately, they couldn't reheat the cookie for me (won't hold that against them). Overall, the cookie was a big letdown. It was a hefty cookie for sure, but the texture and taste were both a little bit off. In particular, the taste seemed a little artificial and the sweetness had a strange aftertaste. It also left a strange coating in my mouth after I ate it. I do not think it is worth the price, and I do honestly feel some grocery store cookies are better than this. Overall, not worth the hype, and I suggest going elsewhere for your chocolate chip cookie fix in New York. 2.5/5 stars."
2416,N4Pss0mR4ygDOoSRpM2FQA,12/25/2022,5 star rating,"Adding on to this, I got their iced mocha and added vanilla. One of the best mochas I've had! Tasted amazing and was made well. Of course I got their cookies again and loved them. Side note: they are open Christmas Day till 5pm which was a life saver. I was struggling to get my coffee fix today."

2418,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,2/19/2023,5 star rating,"I've been here many (many) times and it's safe to say this place doesn't fail you. The food beats other dim sum restaurants only a few blocks away. The price does go up on weekends and holidays, but regardless for an á la carte styled breakfast, it is very affordable. The staff in uniforms push around their carts and you get to pick what you want from them. They'll offer to cut up the food or provide sauces, and then mark your stamp/ticket. I came here for a friend's birthday, and it was perfect! You can bring your non-asian friends here to try out some authentic cantonese dishes."

The inside has the old-school Chinese banquet hall feel, and both times I went there were leftover decorations from someone's wedding party the previous night.The dimsum is ok priced ($4-5 for a S/M/L sized dish) for weekends. It is very spacious inside and can sit almost as many as Jing Fong in the past. We came before 11am and was able to be seated quite easily. The place definitely fills up by 12 though and you will need to wait for a ticket if you come on a weekend at that time.I liked the har gow and the cheung fun dishes (my top go-to) but their salted egg yolk buns are also quite good, with a nice purple bun color. Very aesthetic. I would recommend coming for dimsum for both big and small groups. I guess my only complaint is that sometimes the cart ladies just zoom right pass you and you need to go out of your way to flag them down for something."

I went there on a Sunday morning so it was super packed. I got a table for 10 and waited maybe 15 minutes? It was packed but the lines move fast because they have a lot of tables. I think prices are decent at around 4.25 for the lowest tier item. The quality of the food is pretty good. Big portions of pork ribs with black bean sauce. Good variety of your staples like shrimp dumplings, siu Mais, chicken feet etc. A lot of their special tier items was bleh, could skip. The ladies who were pushing our cart was very nice and go out of their way to get you your dishes.Minus one star because we ordered two noodles dishes for the table. For one of the noodles, they made the wrong order, but the server kept trying to push the dish on us-- saying it will take a long time to remake, it tastes the same etc. He refused to take the dish back the first time and went back to ""check"" the kitchen. The remake noodles was good. Try the chicken chow fun with sauce. For dessert, we got the pretty taro bun with salted egg yolk- this was delicious. Fluffy bun with perfect filling. I would get this again. Apparently you don't have to tip."

The sweet and sour pork and golden egg fried rice is pretty good though the fried rice is not like Canton Gourmet's. The problem is the slow service when I order these two items. It takes 20-30 min for me to pick up the order after +10 people that bought after me got their orders. Overall it's not a bad restaurant though the food and service could be better

The inside has the old-school Chinese banquet hall feel, and both times I went there were leftover decorations from someone's wedding party the previous night.The dimsum is ok priced ($4-5 for a S/M/L sized dish) for weekends. It is very spacious inside and can sit almost as many as Jing Fong in the past. We came before 11am and was able to be seated quite easily. The place definitely fills up by 12 though and you will need to wait for a ticket if you come on a weekend at that time.I liked the har gow and the cheung fun dishes (my top go-to) but their salted egg yolk buns are also quite good, with a nice purple bun color. Very aesthetic. I would recommend coming for dimsum for both big and small groups. I guess my only complaint is that sometimes the cart ladies just zoom right pass you and you need to go out of your way to flag them down for something."
2451,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,9/4/2022,4 star rating,"I know this establishment had been here for a long time and back then I thought it was Mediocre, but recently I went there for dim sum and was pleasantly surprised. I went there on a Sunday morning so it was super packed. I got a table for 10 and waited maybe 15 minutes? It was packed but the lines move fast because they have a lot of tables. I think prices are decent at around 4.25 for the lowest tier item. The quality of the food is pretty good. Big portions of pork ribs with black bean sauce. Good variety of your staples like shrimp dumplings, siu Mais, chicken feet etc. A lot of their special tier items was bleh, could skip. The ladies who were pushing our cart was very nice and go out of their way to get you your dishes.Minus one star because we ordered two noodles dishes for the table. For one of the noodles, they made the wrong order, but the server kept trying to push the dish on us-- saying it will take a long time to remake, it tastes the same etc. He refused to take the dish back the first time and went back to ""check"" the kitchen. The remake noodles was good. Try the chicken chow fun with sauce. For dessert, we got the pretty taro bun with salted egg yolk- this was delicious. Fluffy bun with perfect filling. I would get this again. Apparently you don't have to tip."
2452,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,1/31/2023,3 star rating,Actually this place is not all that bad. I've not tried the bbq stuff on the menu yet. The sweet and sour pork and golden egg fried rice is pretty good though the fried rice is not like Canton Gourmet's. The problem is the slow service when I order these two items. It takes 20-30 min for me to pick up the order after +10 people that bought after me got their orders. Overall it's not a bad restaurant though the food and service could be better

My favorite would have to be the shumai. The service is friendly and there were dim sum carts coming around but the cons of a big banquet is that you would have to wait awhile for the carts to come to your table. The best part was that the bathrooms were clean. There is available paid parking in the back of the building."
2454,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,9/6/2022,3 star rating,"Dim sum was not as good as Lake Pavillion.  However they do have an A grade from the department of health, which made me feel safer.  There was about a 15 minute wait to get a table for 3ppl but that's ok.  Overall the quality of the food was just ok, was kind of difficult to get food as it depends on where your table is located, i had to get up to call the attention of some of the vendors because they woukd skip the middle, since the bigger tablea are towards the window side. Overall service is lacking and parking is difficult in the area"

Overall okay, but I'm not dying to go back."
2456,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,7/3/2022,1 star rating,The service sucks!!!!  They kept  telling people the take out will be 30 mins and the food still not ready after 1 1/2 hours!!!!   The eat in line moved faster!   The people buying take out spent somewhere between $50 -$100. Then did not comp or apologize for the extended wait.  Only and hour in  did they say they will refund you if you did not want the food.  (They did not.). One of their popular dishes- Peking pork chop  was greasy and fatty.  Not crisp!Very disappointed!!!

The food beats other dim sum restaurants only a few blocks away. The price does go up on weekends and holidays, but regardless for an á la carte styled breakfast, it is very affordable. The staff in uniforms push around their carts and you get to pick what you want from them. They'll offer to cut up the food or provide sauces, and then mark your stamp/ticket. I came here for a friend's birthday, and it was perfect! You can bring your non-asian friends here to try out some authentic cantonese dishes."

Then did not comp or apologize for the extended wait.  Only and hour in  did they say they will refund you if you did not want the food.  (They did not.). One of their popular dishes- Peking pork chop  was greasy and fatty.  Not crisp!Very disappointed!!!
2497,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,3/16/2023,5 star rating,Lunch Dimsum in a cart has a special place in my tummy. One of my favorite things to eat and this is recently our go to spot. Servers here are not the best but the cart ladies are nice and sweet! If you ask them for a certain food in a cart they will try their best to bring that food to you. Parking is the worst though this part of flushing.
2498,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,2/19/2023,5 star rating,"I've been here many (many) times and it's safe to say this place doesn't fail you. The food beats other dim sum restaurants only a few blocks away. The price does go up on weekends and holidays, but regardless for an á la carte styled breakfast, it is very affordable. The staff in uniforms push around their carts and you get to pick what you want from them. They'll offer to cut up the food or provide sauces, and then mark your stamp/ticket. I came here for a friend's birthday, and it was perfect! You can bring your non-asian friends here to try out some authentic cantonese dishes."

2500,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,5/19/2022,4 star rating,"Pretty surprised by the negative reviews, but I've been here twice so far and have had pretty positive experiences for dimsum (never tried the buffet). The inside has the old-school Chinese banquet hall feel, and both times I went there were leftover decorations from someone's wedding party the previous night.The dimsum is ok priced ($4-5 for a S/M/L sized dish) for weekends. It is very spacious inside and can sit almost as many as Jing Fong in the past. We came before 11am and was able to be seated quite easily. The place definitely fills up by 12 though and you will need to wait for a ticket if you come on a weekend at that time.I liked the har gow and the cheung fun dishes (my top go-to) but their salted egg yolk buns are also quite good, with a nice purple bun color. Very aesthetic. I would recommend coming for dimsum for both big and small groups. I guess my only complaint is that sometimes the cart ladies just zoom right pass you and you need to go out of your way to flag them down for something."
2501,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,9/4/2022,4 star rating,"I know this establishment had been here for a long time and back then I thought it was Mediocre, but recently I went there for dim sum and was pleasantly surprised. I went there on a Sunday morning so it was super packed. I got a table for 10 and waited maybe 15 minutes? It was packed but the lines move fast because they have a lot of tables. I think prices are decent at around 4.25 for the lowest tier item. The quality of the food is pretty good. Big portions of pork ribs with black bean sauce. Good variety of your staples like shrimp dumplings, siu Mais, chicken feet etc. A lot of their special tier items was bleh, could skip. The ladies who were pushing our cart was very nice and go out of their way to get you your dishes.Minus one star because we ordered two noodles dishes for the table. For one of the noodles, they made the wrong order, but the server kept trying to push the dish on us-- saying it will take a long time to remake, it tastes the same etc. He refused to take the dish back the first time and went back to ""check"" the kitchen. The remake noodles was good. Try the chicken chow fun with sauce. For dessert, we got the pretty taro bun with salted egg yolk- this was delicious. Fluffy bun with perfect filling. I would get this again. Apparently you don't have to tip."
2502,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,1/31/2023,3 star rating,Actually this place is not all that bad. I've not tried the bbq stuff on the menu yet. The sweet and sour pork and golden egg fried rice is pretty good though the fried rice is not like Canton Gourmet's. The problem is the slow service when I order these two items. It takes 20-30 min for me to pick up the order after +10 people that bought after me got their orders. Overall it's not a bad restaurant though the food and service could be better

My favorite would have to be the shumai. The service is friendly and there were dim sum carts coming around but the cons of a big banquet is that you would have to wait awhile for the carts to come to your table. The best part was that the bathrooms were clean. There is available paid parking in the back of the building."

Overall service is lacking and parking is difficult in the area"

I've been coming here since 2014 and haven't stopped. Any thing you order will be fantastic hence its old fashion and nothing beats that. I'm classic so I ordered a regular vanilla ice tan with chocolate syrup and sprinkles which btw beats any ""modern Ice cream shop"" ."

Eddie's though is better, as they do have a lot of seating. A lunch counter service and seats with a bathroom.  Sundaes , egg creams served in silver glasses and goblets and cones.  There's even a atm if you forget cash, but for NY, it's not real expensive at all. Places like this stand the test of time because they stay true to their integrity. And when people want ice cream? They don't want more than twenty flavors to choose from when the average person is indecisive enough. It would however be nice to offer one non dairy option."

I came on a Friday night, so it was packed and busy as expected. It can be pretty chaotic and noisy. They were sold out of my usual Coke base ice cream soda, so I substituted with Vanilla syrup which was overly sweet for me. Don't forget before you come - this place is cash only."

There were a long wait. The young lady took our order, about 5 min after our ice cream were ready! The coconut you can not go wrong with, it tasted like your in jamaica having the real deal, vanilla fudge was great, butter pecan amazing! Wished I could give this spot 10 stars."

It is cash only and hubby and I only had a couple dollars on us so we could only afford a shake.. but we will DEFINITELY be back for the sundaes next time.They make all their items downstairs - everything is legit homemade!!It's a great place to bring your date to end the night or to satisfy that sweet tooth.

I was also excited about the aesthetic/quirkiness of everything (I.e. spiky cupcakes). However, both the cupcake and whoopie pie were fairly dry and felt chalky eating them with their thick icing without a drink. The flavors and menu were great, but just didn't enjoy the basic quality of the baked goods. We did stop by early afternoon, though, so may be worth trying again earlier in the morning!!"

No line on a Sunday evening, so was able to quickly choose from the items still available.Decided on the Granola Bar ($3.75) as well as a Chocolate Spikey Cupcake ($3.75). Items are placed in a to-go box, with a special anti-squishing cardboard ring around the cupcake. Trying the granola first - densely packed bar with fruit, coconut, and peanut butter inside. Overall the entire thing is stale, and most of the flavor that comes out are the oats, which is surprising considering the other ingredients. The cupcake isn't much better, stale cake and chalky frosting, which was particularly disappointing because it looked really good.Service here is okay, but can't get around the stale items. If items have been out for a while, they should be discarded or sold at a hefty discount (so the customer knows in advance)."

We tried the Penelope, Cecilia, Lena, and Mary. They were all mouthwatering pops of flavor but I have to say we both liked the Penelope cookie the best. I don't really have a sweet tooth so for something to stand out for me it really has to be amazing. Our coffees were good too.

Then my husband ordered the muscles and fries - him with the saffron cream sauce and I ordered the garlic wine sauce asked with no better. Fries were good, well seasoned. Portion of mussels were good, the broth was enjoyable - a little salty, very filling. We hope to go back soon and try more dishes!"

I doubt I'll be returning after the rudeness of the female server yesterday . Such a shame as I wanted to go back before I return to Paris.First of all, we will see it all the way in the back when they were other seats more towards the front. Then we had so many different servers, we had no idea who is who.Secondly, they screwed up the order but then got it straight which is OK. The muscles were wonderful very plentiful I really wanted to try the escargot but the bus boy was the one who is taking the order and kind of didn't have an idea what it was.When the bill came, it was recently priced my friend gave the server his portion in cash and, mine was on a card. Normally when you return change you return all of it you don't feel entitled to keep money. Apparently, the female server felt entitled to keep all of it and didn't even say thank you I called her over to get the change back that she should've given and she just gave me a dirty look she didn't give it back about 20 minutes later.This definitely was a very sour ending. Oh well ..on the way out, I was asking for the manager and the bus boy was sort of smirking & spoke broken English , then he said he was the manager I told him what happened and all he said he'll talk to her.I highly doubt that will happen. It's a shame, because I really wanted to return here but I'm pretty sure she'll end up sitting in our food we definitely do not feel welcome there ever again"

Delicious and very nicely thin crepes with just a touch of sweetness.  Got the stroganoff with mashed potatoes. Solid although lacked a bit of seasoning. Also tried the Georgian cheese bread (pie) hachapuri with egg.  Was very nice airy and very stringy gooey cheesy!!  Lastly tried a glass of homemade mors cranberry drink which was delightfully tarty.All in $135.

The visual of the restaurant plays a good role in maintaining the dream. I believe that is what makes Mari Vanna succeed because for their prices, you need to make customers believe that dream. The dream was very strong. The food was decent. It was food you can get elsewhere, but the experience is important. I ordered the borscht, chicken kiev, the beef stroganoff, and a moscow mule between me and my friend. Dishes range between around $10-$50. The service was decent.

I really appreciate that instead of buttered noodles they use buckwheat!!Also love the way they presented it in the cast iron skillet. It's the kind of place that makes you feel at home but is elevated :)There were enough people there to keep it feeling lovely but it was quiet enough for us to enjoy our delicious meal and we had plenty of space:)This is just perfect for a NYC treat and seems to be in a very old building that probably has a lot of interacting history!

When i arrived at 9, i waited a little over 10 mins to be seated. When you walk in they ID you at the door. We were sat at a very small time. Maybe 2ft by 1.5ft table. We ordered hookah right away as well as the passion fruit margarita tower. Which is 100oz for the table. I got the calamari as a started it came with a sweet chili sauce and it was great. 23 were pretty uncomfortable with the size of the table and the constant people passing by. I asked to change tables. After about 20 mins they told me they would move me elsewhere after the other party left ( the party never left). For entrees i ordered the Birria tacos with cheese ($20) my boyfriend got the burger. The tortilla were hand made so they were great. My other friend ordered carnitas tacos and he really liked them. My tacos were stuffed with meat i only ate 2 of the 3. The first DJ was in his feelings. He was playing break up songs for majority of the night. After the dj changed the music the great, it was urban Latino music and some reggaeton. Later in the night one extra friend came so we were a part of 5 so they moved us to a bigger booth. I wish they had movies us earlier because with the hookah and the tower on the table while eating it wasn't comfortable at all. Later in the night they came to sing happy birthday to me, they put on a lil hat on me and i got churros with chocolate dip. The churros were nice and hot. We didn't feel rushed to leave and we were there for a little more then 2 hours. The tower is definitely worth it, it's honestly a great place to pregame."

We did the mango margarita pitcher and immediately it tasted a little off. Come to find out it has cheap vodka in with tequila. We're both sick this morning because we don't drink vodka Food was bland basic Mexican. Had quesadillas (just cheese & shrimp inside) and tacos were basic and unseasoned. Service was attentive and good (hence the 2 stars). 20% gratuity is added to the bill for just two people, which is weird. Hookah was $40, refills $25, pretty reasonable & The hookah girl was really polite.The ambience is very Spanish. A little hip-hop and a little reggae here and there but mostly Spanish which was expected."

I've come here a few times and this time it was one of my favorites. I was in a bit of a rush that night but my bestfriend definitely enjoyed herself and her food! First time trying their one of their signature drinkers and their chicken breast plate. Their chicken breast plate was the best chicken breast I've ever had! Instead of a cutlet or two I got a whole breast! It was cooked to perfection along with the veggies! I tried my bestfriends steak nachos without jalapeños and wow!!!! It was the best steak nachos I've ever had as well! I tried their Tres Leches dessert and it was good but a bit too sweet! We sat by the bar which wasn't so bad cause we got to hear each other speak (the music is very loud there) but we kept getting hit by the wind and it was 40degree so I wouldn't suggest to dress down if you're gonna sit by the bar in the winter lol There is a small parking lot near the restaurant as well which comes in pretty hand because parking isn't that great in that area.

But the DJs insist on playing Spanish music the whole time yet it is clear the customers here are Black. My friend asked for no cheese on her sliders, she mentioned it twice and yet her sliders still came out with cheese. It seems like you can't order the enchiladas without cheese. I won't be returning to this place. I do not like DJs that cannot read the room. Majority of your audience is Black, we do not want to hear salsa and bachata THE WHOLE NIGHT. Service was pretty quick when it came to getting our food but I think people don't truly understand the concept of bottomless mimosas for brunch. We had to flag down the waitress down MANY TIMES to get her attention that we needed a refill."

2564,1gQd8Bg_W9J3hDv_gsNZ7w,8/27/2019,3 star rating,"If you're looking for a classic NY sandwich this is probably the place for you. I instead split the below items with a coworker while another colleague ordered a cold hero from them. Let's dive in:Flounder Special Platter -- aka fish and chips (4/5): The two pieces of flounder are thin and crispy. The fresh lemon really helped here and balanced out the crispness. The fries are cooked to perfection but without anything sprinkled on top -- let alone salt. They included lemon but no tartar sauce. No ketchup either. Both were definitely fried fresh because it took a while (a solid 10 people got their food ahead of me). Would recommend this item but ask for tarter and ketchup (assuming they have both?). Eggplant Parm Hero (3/5): Like the fish this also took a while. Must not be a popular item because one guy had to ask his colleague if they had eggplant today. Turns out they did. The hero roll is a standard NY hero size and what you'd expect (though actually a little soft and no outer texture or flavor). It's a hero roll. Moving on ... The eggplant was alright -- very lightly breaded and soft inside. Not nearly enough tomato sauce which made for an eggplant-and-cheese-dominated bite. I'll probably just order this kind of hero from an Italian place next time. Wouldn't recommend this sandwich. Price (3/5): Okay, so not the reason I'd normally give a place a 3 out of 5 for price. Is this place an affordable lunch spot for FiDi? 100%. What irritated me was the manager. I checked online and the eggplant parm hero was listed at $7.50 from Order Hero and $8.00 from delivery.com. They charge $9 in person which be it, isn't a huge increase, but was confusing nonetheless. I asked the cashier who in turn asked the manager. He told me that online sites take a percentage of the order which led me to ask why it was more in person. If online sites take a percentage, wouldn't they charge more online so it makes up for the lost percentage? The manager was clearly confused and I said fine I'll just order online next time. Pardon my spitefulness here but I'm happy to order online and have them charged a fee for sheer stupidity (or ""convenience"" as the delivery sites put it). Greek Salad (4/5): Got this from MealPal a few times now and it was pretty tasty. The salad had a ton of olive and roasted red pepper. I happen to love those two things so that's a win for me. Not a ton of actual lettuce but it wasn't the freshest so guess that works out. Dressing is your standard red wine vinaigrette which is nice and light. TL;DR: If you eat here go with their simple sandwiches as my coworker preferred that to my above order. I don't blame him. A decent priced bite to eat downtown."

Recommend you come in prepared because the menu is large and difficult to make out from the counter.Quality: Ended up ordering the Godfather Gourmet Sandwich. Proscuitto, cappicola, pepperoni, provolone, lettuce, tomato, and roasted peppers all on a hero. The meat was solid, the bread was a bit stale. I could have used some sauce or at least more oil and vinegar, which may have been an option I did not see on the menu. A place where some customization is needed, so look up the menu before you visit.Quantity: Large sandwich with a good deal of deli meat piled on.Value: $9.00 for the Godfather Gourmet Sandwich.Ambiance: All American Deli is located in the FiDi of Manhattan. A surprisingly large store, they have a massive deli counter in the back and a good sized seating area up front. It has a very old school vibe, one that may need a bit of modernization to increase traffic.Crowd: Surprised to find it empty during weekday lunch hour.Service: Struggled to see the menu, so just asked for the most popular item. Glad they picked the sandwich they did, but lose points for no one at the register when I was looking to pay.Parking: Parking is not a good option."

I soon found myself smiling at the bartender's antics, as he danced and sang his way to the bartending Hall of Fame.

I climbed back up and asked him to explain himself, to which he responded with thuggish threats without providing any explanation for his actions.I called the police, who arrived shortly onto the scene. Upon being questioned by the police, the bouncer described a preposterous story about how I had been hurling homophobic slurs and grabbing the doorknob, to which he had no choice but to respond by force. Frustratingly, it devolved into a he said he said argument, and since I was lucky enough to walk away with a few bloody scrapes and nothing more serious, left it there for the night.I made a harassment claim to document the incident (which I've uploaded), and even now I am not sure what set the bouncer off on this relatively quiet night besides possibly a case of mistaken identity combined with totally inappropriate overzealousness.That awful experience aside, there's really nothing notable about this neighborhood bar in terms of ambience, and the quality of service was below average.

Please pay attention to the huge amount of rice, and I can't even talk about the wasabi! Barely there! Anyways, this roll cost me $8 used to be $6.50 and before that $4.50.

The soy sauce was many small packets of Kikkoman with no containers--kind of annoying. There were several containers of eel sauce. Strange since I didn't order any eel. Lots of spicy mayo, which I do like. The seaweed salad looked and tasted great, but it was watery, and it leaked all over one of the bags. The crispy rice is described as ""Fried Rice topped with sweet sauce and spicy mayo, masago."" What I got was sticky rice wrapped in breading and fried, and topped with a sauce that tasted like duck sauce, plus perhaps bits of tofu. It tasted nice, but there wasn't much masago or spicy mayo, and it was soggy. Miso soup was on the blander end of the spectrum. The seafood soup was tasted good enough. They definitely didn't skimp on the salmon. The cucumber was missing though. The salmon and tuna tartars tasted great, though they were spicier than most salmon or tuna tartars. The Gemini and spicy salmon rolls were fine. The palate cleansers and garnishes were carrots, ginger, and wasabi. The wasabi was watery."

It was all freshly made and yummy. We stuck to a vegetarian diet this time around. So,  first out was the shiraga... basically a veggie samosa... the crust was delicious,  moist, flaky and not oily.   The filling, mostly potatoes, peas,  and onion curry,  was yummy. We then ordered the 3 veggie breakfast items.. curried potatoes,  dal,  and mixed veggies. The potatoes were awesome,  perfectly cooked and seasoned,  thinly sliced red potatoes.   The mixed veggies was a good simple veggie curry.   I wasn't the biggest fan of the dal, it wasn't seasoned enough for my tastes; my friend loved it.  I requested hot sauce,  they didn't have any,  but she said they had fresh chilies, and brought them out on a bed of salad (a nice touch)  We also ordered the partha, naan and roti... they were all good.. nothing to write home about,  but good solid bread. The milk tea was very fragrant. We also ordered the dodhi pudding (a yogurt based pudding,  supposedly made with a long gourd)   it was delicious,  a bit sour/ salty... but still sweet.   Definitely worth trying."

The spicy tomato daal base with lemon grass shoots, chunks of shrimp and chicken disappeared in no time despite being family sized. Probably one of my top 5 soups ever! We also ordered a side of chicken lollipop that tasted better than the last time I came. Not super battered, crunchy, although I feel like it could use more flavor. I like to use dipping sauces as a compliment to the flavors in the chicken rather than necessary for taste. Otherwise staff is exceptional and food is great"

2638,LfPtY7hYpOsNTaxgfny_hw,4/4/2023,3 star rating,"Management says oat milk is $5 more a gallon than whole milk so the $1 per drink up-charge for plant milk is indeed a profit center, as a gallon yields more than 5 drinks. I was making you aware that you competitors don't up-charge so maybe you shouldn't either. Charge a few more nickels on all drinks to avoid the unnecessary friction with a consumer product choice that happens to be exploding in popularity. Bigger issue with all these places is consistency. A hungover barista can cause serious issues. Blank Street Coffee has raised $87 million over the last two years because they automate that barista process, and thus have a scalable, repeatable and reliable business model. Independent coffee shops better take note of innovation coming their way!"

The staff is always friendly and very prompt in making the drinks, even if the store is crowded -- I've never had to wait more than 3 minutes for a drink. They have a punch card rewards program, as well as a 10% student discount with a school ID. The outdoor seating arrangement is fantastic. It truly provides a nice vibe and a warm atmosphere.  Both the espresso and bakery Madman locations have it and they're both near this dog grooming place so you're always sure to spot a nice variety of dogs while sitting here."

The broth was full of flavor, and the beef was good quality. I have to say, it does irk me when the noodles are all stuck together in one big ball, and it's been like that most times I've been here. If they easily came apart, it would be no issue, but I had to work at it for a bit. But hey, maybe that's part of the experience.I've also had their crispy spring rolls and pork chop, which were really good. The pork chop comes on the side of the pho bowl and it's marinated really well. Really great meat overall. The spring rolls were pretty good, although I think they could be a little crispier. There aren't many ~good~ pho places in the city, so I'm happy to have this spot!"
2648,yvg56iLnpb2cDb1rCZrCUA,11/29/2022,4 star rating,"This is an interesting review to write because I didn't like the way some staff treated other patrons and myself. There was an argument where they didn't give the customer the correct order and still expected them to pay the price. Another instance, a customer had been waiting a long time to pick up their food but wasn't acknowledged so they took the food and were chased back in. It made me hesitant to continue my order. But the woman who brought my soup out was nice and I'm glad that I stayed.The food was delicious. I cannot take that away from them. I ordered the beef flank with the brisket and the meat was extremely tender. The soup came out piping hot. I never know what to season my pho with and with the initial taste, it didn't need much. I still added some sriracha, chili sauce, hoisin sauce, along with the basil, bean sprouts then squeezed the lemon over it. I also ordered a Banh Mi (chicken sandwich) and while I was waiting for it, the soup had cooled down enough for me to basically inhale it. That's how good it was. Although I feel that it took a bit for me to get the sandwich. Not the end of the world, the soup wasn't cold or anything. The Banh Mi was my first, so idk what to compare it to or what it's supposed to taste like. The chicken was sweet, I imagine it's supposed to be. When I dipped the Banh Mi into the soup, something I saw someone else do, it added so much to the flavor. The bread wasn't hard or dry, the sandwich was good on its own. The soup took it to the next level. I wanted to order a watermelon strawberry drink but was told that they were out and that the mango mix they had wasn't very good. I don't know if I should take it as transparency or them trying to get me out. There were staff members who would stand around looking for things to take. Maybe because it wasn't busy. If you're good at ignoring what's going on around you and want really good pho and Banh Mi, here's the place. Menu prices have also changed."

The place is very spacious and the menu was very simplistic. I ordered the number 1 big bowl and it had everything that I wanted from brisket, to tripe, and beef. I know this place is good when I do not need to add anything to the broth other than jalapenos. The broth was very clean and clear but very rich. Noodles were plentiful and there was a good amount of meat. After tax and tip, a big bowl was $15, which is very affordable. This is the perfect place to get pho and if you had a long night out, this is the best place to detox. One of the best pho places so far in NYC that I've tried."

2654,yvg56iLnpb2cDb1rCZrCUA,9/18/2022,3 star rating,It's a decent option for Vietnamese by Grand St with a wide menu although they don't have Bun Bo Hue or Bun Rieu. The food here is decent but pretty standard. We got the pork chop rice and a chicken curry - the pork chop was well seasoned but a bit on the dry side and the chicken curry sauce was a little flatter ( no coconut milk to deepen the flavor dimensions). The prices are probably the lowest in the area - you can get a rice box for less than $10. Overall it's decent and will satisfy a craving for Vietnamese if you want something quick and cheap.

There was a bouncer at the door checking IDs, who was super nice, and upon entering, the bartender immediately acknowledged us and took our order with no wait at all.We decided to try two frozen margaritas (one pomegranate and one lime - my go to for the warmer months) and headed to the roof. The roof was much more lively than the door stairs area, but both had their perks. Kinda nice to have two options all in the same bar. My margarita was perfect, exactly what you want without it being too fancy. My only complaint was the paper straw. I know this is environmentally friendly but it is not frozen marg friendly. I had to keep biting the straw to get the frozen pieces out. Still, not the bar's fault!We only stuck around for one drink since it was a school night but I definitely am looking forward to spending a bit more time here in the future. The lavender drink has my name written all over it!"

2690,SGT9FStEKqnGb51331ut4Q,11/7/2020,1 star rating,"Be warned their ""cocktails"" are basically shots over ice. All ice, tiny cups, $12 each. Ambience is lackluster. Rather than including a small tasting menu, they include a small, untoasted bagel with a minuscule schmear of cream cheese which pairs perfectly with their subpar drinks. A night of joy turned into a night of disappointment filled with the bleak darkness of regret. Edit:They charge you $4 per trash bagel and you need to have 1 per drink for the first round. Added pic of receipt, trash bagel is called ""andrew sandwich"""

The place itself is cute but I immediately had to run to the rooftop. The rooftop is cash only and offers only certain drink options - for full bar you'll need to go downstairs . The rooftop is cute - not much of a view but aesthetically pleasing .Drinks were fine - they're fancy cocktails that taste nothing like alcohol because there's probably none in there so I switched to beer. , I'm not from NY but I imagine 7$ for a cocktail during happy hour is a steal."

2697,okF1w-7gZNy2OB73SsjuYw,2/4/2023,5 star rating,Best whiskey bar in Brooklyn. Likely the best in Brooklyn and Queens. Possibly the best in all of NYC but I haven't been to enough whiskey bars outside of Brooklyn and Queens to make that claim.  No clue how a bar with this selection that's been opened for almost a decade has only 55 reviews at the time of this writing. The selection greatly focuses on special editions and hard to find bottles. It's a wonderful collection and the bartender did a fantastic job of helping us navigate it. He was extremely knowledgeable and made our experience wonderful. It turned out to be one of the best tastings of ever had.
2698,okF1w-7gZNy2OB73SsjuYw,10/16/2021,5 star rating,"Just had an awesome experience at Travel Bar this evening on our last (and only) night in NYC this weekend. We were pretty impressed by their selection and prices were pretty reasonable. Atmosphere was chill and relaxed. Kind of hipster/trendy but with a splash of that neighborhood dive vibe. Patrons weren't too loud or rowdy and definitely not stuck up or pretentious. BATHROOM WAS CLEAN!Husband had several 1oz pours with amazing recommendations from Bill, our amazing bartender. I had the whiskey sour, which I was supposed to nurse but I definitely was a bad babysitter- so good! Definitely not your typical ""I can get this anywhere just-add-whiskey"" mix.I must say though that the highlight of the night for me was Bill. He was very friendly and professional. Since we got there around 730pm and it wasn't too crowded, we were able to chat him up. Bill was extremely knowledgeable and took the time to educate me on the different types of whiskey/bourbon and trivia of certain distillers. But as the night passed on, we unfortunately had to share him with the other patrons. However, I noticed that he was really attentive to everyone in the bar and never mad us feel ignored or forgotten. Amazing service!Highly recommend!"

I ordered my whiskey sour and my husband who loves his bourbon ordered a taster. Throughout our time here, the owner was seated with us and what a great time we had! He was very knowledgeable on all the bourbon / whiskeys they had, and even suggested some for my husband to try. He chatted with us for a while and it was really nice of him. Also prices were VERY reasonable considering it's NY. We can't wait to come back here when we return to NY"

These guys know what they're doing and it shows! Secondly, talking w/the owners at the bar was an experience in and of itself! It's called Travel Bar for a reason! I don't think there is a place on the planet these two have NOT been!Thirdly, the crowd and ambiance is fantastic! I met an amazing couple from Scotland & St. Louis, respectively and we laughed and chatted the night away! Then a regular came in and joined in the convo! I was able to mark so many great pours off my Bourbon & Whiskey bucketlist here and the prices were shockingly reasonable! Do yourself a favor and stop in! Whether you're a whiskey veteran or a newb, this place will meet your standards or give you a proper introduction and schooling!"

2714,1yqrirjDVm40roP-NcU-Ig,1/16/2022,4 star rating,"This place has kind of been a running joke in our family because the space used to be a bar/lounge way back when, and we would question who would ever go there. Well, it's now more fittingly a Japanese restaurant.Ordered delivery from them, and it was quick. Their prices can't be beat. Their bento boxes are about $4 cheaper than their nearest competition. Note that (on GrubHub), they have two prices listed for bento boxes with no descriptions whatsoever. The one that's an extra $1.15 comes with tempura instead of salad! Also, the bentos come with a California roll, miso soup, a few pieces of broccoli, and two tiny shumai. Hell of a lunch special for ~$11!I went with the katsu appetizer (an entire box of delicious fried chicken cutlets for $9!). Very good.I also got one of their $15 specialty rolls (the Okean with tuna, salmon, avocado, yellowtail, and jalapeno), which was a bit disappointing. They also forgot to include any soy sauce with our order.I'd definitely order from them again since my parents were a fan of the bento boxes - they got the beef and the salmon. Maybe no sushi next time though."
2715,1yqrirjDVm40roP-NcU-Ig,7/10/2022,3 star rating,"Sushi tasted okay, Sashimi  wasn't too bad, but the Chicken Katsu Bento box tasted oddly sour. Ordered takeout on the weekend, wait time was over 30 minutes. This isn't the only store that offers bento box combos, and chicken Katsu goes well with that special Teriyaki sauce. So for the Fried chicken cutlet to taste sour, just doesn't really sit well with me. What was meant to be an enjoyable meal with the family turned into the Bento box left uneaten. Prices have jumped higher, the cashier didn't inform that combo Sushi/Sashimi cost less than ordering a la-carte. Told me I should've checked their WeChat account before ordering. Wonder if that's the new rule now."

The ambiance could use a little help, it's just kinda like your average coffee shop but there's nothing wrong with that! I like that they have pastry options as well as some more real food options. We tried one of the seasonal pastries, gingerbread muffin. And it was pretty good, not amazing, but it was flavorful. It could have been a bit more moist. Think coiffed is always reliable, the coffee is good, it's just not anything particularly amazing or special but that's not the role that most upper scale coffee places are trying to fill. It's exactly what it's supposed to be. I ordered a oat milk cappuccino, and it was delicious!"

2721,3Lj7gVcMG6hy9lv-4bdIBg,1/10/2022,4 star rating,"Needed something to eat, and a place to work. So I chose Think Coffee. If you are vaccinated, you can sit inside too (during the pandemic at least) and work along the wall where there is seating and tables, as well as outlets under the seats that you can plug your computer/devices into for any electronics that need charging or power. This café is very cozy, small, and intimate. You can tell that everyone who works here is like a little community, and I saw the manager or the owner walking around a lot and talking to the suppliers/delivery people. And it has a good vibe. The food is pretty tasty, and the price isn't too bad. It's overall good value to sit there for a few minutes to several hours and work or relax while drinking or eating something. It's a bit dark when I went but it's winter so what do you expect. Overall a good visit. And the coffee and food was enjoyable. TLDR; nice staff, decent food and value for price, pretty good coffee, interior is pretty nice, not super amazing upscale or anything, but a chill place with laid back people where you can work or hang out for a while."

Their coffee tastes great (I have tried several ones) and their food is amazing. I loveee the egg sandwich with avocado, even the bread seems homemade. Their sweets are tasty as well.

She took care of that line in the quickness and with a smile!  She was extremely polite and made our subway experience pleasant (which you don't always get while dining at subway locations) Minus 1 star, because of the parking. I think subway and other companies on that block shouldn't let the restaurant/hall take up street parking along with parking on the sidewalk .. I mean how is that even allowed? I almost didn't eat here, because I couldn't find parking. I was able to grab a spot in 711 parking lot, but was worried about being towed.

There is a decent seating area with a big flat screen tv. They also have free wifi. The staff is nice and friendly. I like subway a little better as a fast food place than other places because there are way more heathlier options here than other fast food places. Whole Wheat Bread, Turkey, Tuna, Spinach, etc. You can get apple slices instead of chips of cookies with the meal deals. I haven't tried it yet but they have breakfast options now too.

I ordered the burrata con prosciutto & tartufo nero, stinco di annello brasato, and shared the tiramisu and panna cotta dessert with a friend. The burrata was good, with the crisp of the veggies and the saltiness of the prosciutto. My friend had the piadina which was similar to my burrata but just a different cheese and on top of a thin flatbread. The braised lamb shank was amazing and just fell apart with the fork without needing a knife. I've had better mushroom risotto, it needed a little more seasoning. The panna cotta and tiramisu were both great, refreshing and creamy, respectively and weren't too sweet. They didn't skimp on the restaurant week portions because two of the three of us had to take half our entree to go. Overall, a great choice for restaurant week."

You could certainly taste the truffle which was a nice touch although I do wish the risotto was cooked more, it was a little Al Dante.The meal came rather quickly which we did absolutely appreciate."

It needed seasoning or marinating over night. The potatoes had flavor probably  due to the pan frying in oil with rosemary sprigs added to it.

The establishment is take-out only I'm assuming due to Covid but this place had orders coming in frequently. When I looked at the menu I was pleasantly surprised because I saw jerk chicken on the menu and realized I was in a Guyanese Chinese spot. I was so happy and got a large order of jerk chicken with fried rice and what I was craving (the chx & broccoli). Both dishes are delicious and now every time I crave chicken & broccoli I have to grab it from here. I can no longer get it from my local spot because it doesn't have the same flavors.

Being in Queens and the heart of ""Little Guyana"" aka Richmond Hill, it's at a disadvantage, because there are sooooooooooo many other great options in the area (and many of them do it better).- Their fried rice is good, but not anything to write home about. Again, if they were in a different borough, they likely would've gotten a higher star, but the competition in the area is too high. Personally though, I like the Lo-Meins here better (the Roast Duck & Pepper Shrimp in particular).- I do give them props though for working in more Chinese style dishes onto their WI/Caribbean menu. It's not something you see often in Caribbean/WI restaurants."

2758,TynT1ykBkQhXd6nuTK6JUQ,12/14/2022,3 star rating,"One of my favorite bagel spots in Queens, but with a few caveats. I've been going here for almost 10+ years now (even with their change of names and owners over the years). Their bagels are always freshly made in-house and coffee is really great as well.Unfortunately, the prices have really gone up and quality has really gone down. $18 for 3 bagels is pretty insane. The bagels are also pretty thin, occasionally burnt, and barely have any cream cheese. I'm well aware of the shortage but it's pretty unfortunate bc they used to be known for giving big portions of cream cheese.Also, one of the workers has overcharged me or messed up my order at least 3 times now. When I try to nicely ask why I was charged extra or ask to correct the price, she gets super defensive and one time even made me pay for 2 coffees even tho I specifically told her decaf and she messed up the first order. Really sucks to watch this neighborhood gem lose some of the value that brought so many people here in the first place."

Costs me about 5.37, but all I received was a thin layer of cream cheese which I didn't feel satisfying. This experience will turn me away from ordering stuff like this, but I do like their everything bagels. I probably will just order plain bagels only."

Service is attentive and friendly, and while our order took a bit of time to get to us, it was worth the wait.Any combination of spinach and paneer on the menu is a winner and absolute must try. They each have a distinct enough flavor profile that if your stomach is up for it, you should try them all. We got the Paneer Nori Rolls, Spinach Cheese cutlet, and the palak paneer bowl, which is accompanied by some tangy chutney.  The other highlight of the menu is the Date Cardamom shake, which is a generously spiced, creamy flavor bomb. In terms of texture and taste, this ranks amongst the best vegan shakes I've had.To round it out, we also tried the Quinoa Tabbouleh Salad, and while tasty, it was probably the most ordinary-albeit familar- part of the meal. Although the menu recommends it for cold weather, the bowl was fairly lukewarm, and it wouldn't feel out of place ordering it at a Chopt/Sweetgreen.Will definitely be visiting here again. If you're in the area please stop by!"
2768,NKI1VvfXYluRjnq4S6yEuw,3/12/2023,4 star rating,"Was skeptical about this place since I do like non-vegetarian meals for maximum satiety but was still interested in giving Divya's a shot a) because my friend chose this place for his birthday dinner, and b) I was intrigued by the concept of nourishment through Ayurvedic practices in place. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. While we were a large group and tried a plethora of menu options, my top picks were:Spinach Paneer Cutlet (5/5): my favorite appetizer of the night that paired really well with the sauces that came with it.Vegetarian Lasagna (4/5): the portions were great and flavors were indulgent as you would want from a lasagna but all while feeling nourished. Custom Bowl: for this I chose the Seared Paneer for protein (5/5), roasted veggies cooked to perfection (5/5), the lentils (4/5), quinoa and wild rice (4/5). The Carob Cake (5/5) was my favorite of the three desserts we tried, and the Pineapple Halwa was a close second (4/5), while the Pecan Cookie was auite alright (3/5).Other items we tried: Curry Bowl (3/5), Coconut Chips (4/5), Sunflower Mozzarella appetizer (3/5), Paneer Nori Rolls (3/5).The service, calming music and vibes, and the carob cake were the highlights of the night."

The interiors are warm and welcoming and I loved the music. I tried the date smoothie which reminded me of a holy Indian drink called ""charnamrit"", it was sumptuous though only half a glass, wouldn't have minded a glassful of that. For the main course, I opted for the quinoa which was presented nicely and surrounded by herbs. However, I thought the oils and spices in it were overdone, and it made for a salty and rather overwhelming dish, so I got a side of plain quinoa to mix in. In the end, the price added up for a meal I'd perhaps not have again. Having said that, I dabble with a fair bit of Indian cooking myself and so this perhaps comes from a more critical standpoint. I'm on the lookout for how to incorporate healthy protein-rich diets into a daily staple and this encounter with Divya's only helped me explore my ideas more. Their endeavor to nudge patrons to eat healthier and focus on gut health is commendable."
2770,NKI1VvfXYluRjnq4S6yEuw,1/15/2023,4 star rating,"Made reservations for a table of 6 for 7:15 pm on a Saturday night, and the place was fully packed. Nice, cozy set-up with some soft music in the background and noise levels at average is how I'd describe the ambiance at Divya's Kitchen.The menu is very inspired by Ayurdeva and focused on Dosha's (The five elements combined in pairs to form the three bodily humours) - but I couldn't quite translate/figure out how the food combinations contributed to the dosha's.Food overall is very much on the sweeter side, which my biggest disappointment. We ordered a few small bits which consisted on Spiced Coconut Chips, Spinach-Cheese Cutlets, Paneer Nori Rolls, and Roasted Sweet Potatoes. The table enjoyed Chips and the Paneer Nori Rolls were my favorite. The Roasted Sweet Potatoes went really well with their spicy green chutney - which was my absolute favorite of the evening! I was having chutney shots towards the end of my meal!For mains, the winner was the Season Kitchari ($18 + $6 Paneer Protein) - packed with flavor, followed by Vegetable Curry in Cashew Sauce ($21). I got the Carrot Risotto ($21 + $6 Paneer) - which was disappointingly on a sweeter side, but filling enough in terms of portion size. The sauteed leafy greens were forgettable, but the basil-parsley pesto was packed with flavor. The extra protein we ordered for Kitchari and Risotto again was on the sweeter side - quite disappointing.Service was absolutely excellent, attentive and friendly staff. Overall, we had a good experience, but might not return again. A definite one time try if you like a modern take on Indian food, on the sweeter side."

2774,NKI1VvfXYluRjnq4S6yEuw,4/15/2022,4 star rating,"Came here for a birthday dinner shortly after visiting another high-end vegan restaurant in midtown. In contrast, the vibe here is much more warm and inviting, casual but chic, and very down to earth. When I want a healthier vegan meal that seems more balanced, I always think of Divya's for their Ayurvedic meals.I came for the vegetable lasagna because it looked fantabulous in the photos.So after an extremely salty and overpriced vegan meal, this lasagna felt like a warm hug of your mom's cooking. That said, the vegetables (particularly broccoli) were definitely way overcooked, soft and mushy and very oily. You could tell this was prepared in a large batch and reheated multiple times. This lasagna would be great if the vegetables were still green and just cooked but not overcooked. The lasagna noodle also didn't have too much taste to it (like all the flavor was boiled out). But overall, this meal just felt very cozy and satisfying, so I tried to ignore the fact the vegetables were mush and enjoy all of the vegan ricotta and pesto. About half an hour after leaving I could also still feel the warm heat of the black pepper. I was quite surprised that this said Vata/Pitta.I don't have photos of the first time I came a few years ago, but also came with friends and tried the kitchari and some appetizers and the rose chocolate dessert but my company felt it was a tad overpriced and underwhelming. Anywhos, I really want to come back and enjoy some tea and kitchari. But I really hope there can be a tad more attention to detail on the food and making sure it tastes as fresh as it is.The venue and people are sweet. The other customers who eat here are also the friendly, warm, laughing, kind-hearted souls who make you feel like you're in company with high vibe people who share similar values."
2775,NKI1VvfXYluRjnq4S6yEuw,3/20/2022,5 star rating,"I'd never tried ayurvedic food before, but it seems to be characterized by nutritious, comforting foods that are vegetable-heavy and flavorful but not overly spiced. (And it avoids certain vegetables like tomatoes and potatoes.) At first glance, the prices seem a bit high for dishes composed of such simple ingredients. However, everything is so well-prepared and packed with flavor while still being really healthy, so honestly, I think the experience is worth the price.On my first visit, I tried the cucumber avocado salad, which comes topped with watercress and a lovely walnut-avocado dressing.Since then, I've had the chance to try a few other dishes that have been great across the board. One of their specialties, the khichari bowl, really exceeded my expectations. So comforting yet full of flavor. The cilantro-mint chutney that comes on the side adds even more zing. The roasted vegetables bowl was also great, especially those tasty beluga lentils! I also tried the sweet waffles available on the brunch menu which were also very good.For dessert, the carob coconut cake was great: moist, sweet, and satisfying. The ""pistachio fudge"" was not my favorite. It doesn't contain chocolate (despite the name) and is basically lumps of mashed dates with pistachio sprinkled on top. I think they should rebrand them as energy bites or something rather than a dessert. The ayurvedic chai is excellent both hot and iced. The date cardamom shake is a must-try!It's worth noting that they have a number of vegetarian-but-not-vegan options such as savory pancakes (made with buttermilk), some dishes with paneer, and the pineapple upside-down cake for any vegan-phobic friends you may have (you know you do)."

Unfortunately, it did not meet our expectations - to start, we waited 20 minutes for them to take our order.My friends and I ordered 1) lasagna, 2) vegan lasagna, and 3) vegetable curry, and each of our first bites was unanimously full of flavor. However, each bite after was more and more disappointing as we discovered new flavors. Not sure why I even bothered taking a to-go box; these were leftovers I was not looking forward to."

The salmon is particularly rich and flavorful and pairs well with the minty zing of the shiso. The ikura is on the lighter side, but still adds a depth of umaminess to the dish.

I found that the negitoro bowl was a good size and that was only because I added seaweed salad and a miso soup for extra cost! Without extras, I think the bowls are very small and not worth the price. The bowl costs almost $30 for extras! Very steep price! The flavors and toro tartar was good and fresh. The miso soup was nothing out of the ordinary. Overall, good bowls if you want to pay extras for fill it up. But good flavors and most importantly, fresh fish."

The taste is like a spicy salmon roll you can get in American sushi restaurants, but in a bowl.$17Goma shoyu tunaI liked this bowl a bit better. It had a more refreshing taste. There was lots of seaweed and a quarter of an avocado, yum! The tuna seemed like OK quality.For both bowls, the fish was chopped quite small and inconsistently. I like that the sushi rice had a chew and there was crunchy stuff in both bowls to make it texturally interesting. The high quality disposable chopsticks were nice too.Overall, I thought it tasted good, and price is about what I expect when dining in NYC."

This time I ordered an egg and tomato sandwich and a toasted croissant at the order counter. The woman taking orders seemed put off by asking for a croissant to be toasted, not sure why since it tastes a lot better if crisped and warm.Five minutes later the counter guy calls me to the counter and hand me a bag with only the egg sandwich. I asked if my croissant was still coming, since arguably that would come out at least as fast as the sandwich. The counterperson looked confused and went back and threw it in a bag to hand to me and I said ""I ordered it toasted. Can you toast it please?""  He looked exasperated and told the woman running the toaster, who also gave an incredulous look and threw the croissant on the counter by the toaster. I wait another five minutes while she toasts 20 or more pieces of bread and pastry for orders that came in after me, all the while my croissant is sitting there on the counter. I went up to the register and asked politely if they were going to toast my croissant and he seemed like he was at a loss what to do (throw it in the toaster maybe?) and was looking at the woman running the toaster. She still didn't put it in for 2-3 more minutes, seemingly finding anything she could be doing other than helping me, now waiting 12-15 minutes for a toasted croissant and me having to run back to my wife to take bites of my now-cooling sandwich. Finally the toaster worker throws it in a bag, smashing the side of the croissant in the process and the bag is rudely shoved at me without a word.Last time for me at Orwashers.

Didn't think this was all that impressive. 7) Whole Sticky Bun Babka. my favorite item from the store so far! Super buttery and soft with sweet pecan goodness on top! It did came with a hefty price of $17 bucks for a small loft however. 8) everything bagel. Good bagel but no scallion cream cheese? :( Overall, this is a decent spot.

I had only taken a piece of the baguette - so I took the remaining almost full $4.00 baguette and threw it in the garbage.

But this is a decent option in the area and it is a little cheaper too. Their bagels are bigger, more doughy and the cream cheese is a little runnier. They give you a heads up that it will take a while to toast the bagel as they only have one oven. We got an onion bagel with cream cheese. It was good. Long line on weekend mornings. One area to order and a separate area to pay."

They have a breakfast deal with $5.50 for a small coffee, bagel with eggs and cheese on it. I got a garlic bagel with eggs and cheese. They don't have any meat here, I think because it is kosher. They made my coffee wrong (I wanted black and they gave me both milk and sugar). They also were pretty rude. The bagel was pretty soft and nice, but there was barely any eggs or cheese. Definitely not coming back here."

The service was horrible, I came in a Saturday morning, the cashier was arguing with an old lady and the server had to ask me 3 times what my order was because he could not remember a simple bagel order and it wasn't even busy. Forest hills deserves a better bagel place with better people.... You'll get better service at McDonalds down the street.

Now I will never go back. There were dirty rags on top of bagels and when I kindly tried to tell the owner the situation was unsanitary he rolled his eyes at me and said have a nice life next order. Obviously I left after this. It's one thing to have an employee make a mistake. It's another to not care about food safety and sanitary conditions which this man obviously has no regard in addition to complete disrespect for his customers.

The mocha flavor seems to taste just right - not overpowering and not too light. The cake layers themselves are very airy and fluffy, and I love the various garnishes on top of the caramel drizzle - the chocolate decorative pieces, the brownies, and the chocolate cream filled pirouette cookies. I'd personally prefer a bit more buttercream filling in between the cake, but overall, I think this is a really unique and tasty option when you're looking for a cake. I think the price is relatively comparable (if not even a bit cheaper, though for a smaller size) to cakes at other bakeries around the area (Fayda, Martha's, etc)."

This lil shop is located right on Washington Ave and serves Caribbean food. I came in on a Tuesday really excited to try the food and found out that they only sell patties on that day :( My heart was a little broken but I was also happy to see they weren't sold out of the patties. I ordered the beef and jerk chicken with a Jamaican Kola. Prices are fair, staff is friendly and I'm team beef patty over jerk chicken #classic.

So on this bipolar November day lol  I took a stroll to Prospect Park and walked down Washington. The place was small but those are usually the best places. They had a variety of flavors to choose from but I opted for the mild beef Pattie with coco bread, which the gentleman went in the back for the fresh baked bread. The total was 4.75 and worth it! The coco bread was soft and had a sweet taste to it. But the beef Patty omg the crust flaky with a hint of sweetness, the meat was seasoned well and juicy. I wish I would've ordered 2 lol it was so good! Definitely will take a stroll again and probably try the jerk chicken patty and definitely the coco bread lol."

I used to love Tastee patty in brooklyn but they have fallen off in taste or are usually out but this place always have Patty's. I usually get the curry or jerk. my mother in law is from Kansas and always asks me to get her beef Patty's whenever she visits & I go to Brooklyn. I have also had their bake & saltfish 4/5, curry chicken roti 5/5 & their muffins are pretty good too. The upside is no stink attitude like the Jamaican restaurants so that is plus. They have other food items that I haven't tried but definitely get the patty's and the roti., you will not be disappointed, they are great."

After seeing numerous people walking in and out on a Friday afternoon and then again on a random Monday evening, I decided to give Little Miss Muffin a try. I ordered the curried chicken and jerk chicken patties, two of their most popular flavors, each for only $2.75. Given that empanadas are often $3+, this is a great deal.The patties came out fresh. The outer crust was perfect, somewhat flaky with good structure, while the inner fillings were flavorful. The ratio of shell to filling was spot-on. The jerk chicken was spicier (which my partner preferred).   Besides patties, they also sell muffins, scones, croissants, cookies, and hot cross buns. On weekends Little Miss Muffin serves hot food specials. A return visit is in my future!"

The sauce is somewhat sweet with a little heat.  I would recommend that you make the effort and judge for yourself, but it's 5-stars for me!"

We just wanted to keep it healthy and noticed a couple on a bench eating some very appetizing bowls. We asked where they got them and found ourselves at Springbone where business was bustling mostly with takeout orders. Since they had a free outdoor table, we decided to have lunch right there on 3rd Street.Their chalkboard menu had several options available - a half dozen bowls, five soups, and at least eight different kinds of bone broth. Jamie decided on the $12.50 Mexican Bowl with free-range chicken, black beans, guacamole, pico de gallo, and chili sauce on top of a bed of Spanish bone broth rice (photo: bit.ly/3n0eP7k). It was like a fresher take on a Chipotle bowl. Mine was the $12.50 Grandma's Chicken and Rice which interestingly used the same rice, chicken, and chili sauce as the Mexican Bowl.The switch out was the addition of braised Brussels sprouts and cashew white sauce (photo: bit.ly/3qDaERt). It was definitely comfort food and the use of bone broth in the rice was a nice touch. My one minor quibble was that I would've preferred my chicken in shards rather than cubes. While we were eating, we noticed a constant stream of customers picking up their orders. A good sign. We also need to try their various bone broths, which we know is good for us, and they're available by online order nationwide.FOOD - 4 stars...tasty, healthy bowls that use their bone brothsAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...a bit cramped inside but there are a couple of outside tablesSERVICE - 3.5 stars...a bit scattered but it workedTOTAL - 4 stars...definitely a solid option in the Village if you want to keep it healthy RELATED - Hungry in NYC?

I remember once they put my name as Jackie.- The service could be better. Often times I'm at the checkout counter just waiting for someone to appear.- Tables gotta be cleaned regularly. As we all know, some customers are not great at tidying up after themselves.- The new 2 for $12.99 deal sounds good if you want to have more than one item to eat, but let me tell you, that salad is smol. So smol in fact, that I wish I had just gotten the regular salad for $9.- That crunchy avocado toast would've been good, except the ""spicy avocado"" is genuinely very spicy. I thought it would've been like a white person level kind of spicy, but wow, I had to take gulps of water in between each bite..."

My friend and I made the mistake of ordering anything at all from here, but we wanted some Impossible Sliders. We'd had them before at another White Castle and they were surprisingly good. These...were not. To top it off, the staff was yelling in the kitchen about how they dropped our food. Pretty sure one of us ate one ""Yelper's Special"" that spent some time on beshitted ground. If anything is worse than eating off the floor of the L train at 3am on Friday night it would be this.That Coca-Cola freestyle was on point though. Had to earn that one star somewhere."

You would think the last place in Manhattan to afford space for a parking lot is White Castle, but you'd be wrong.We dropped in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon to redeem a T-mobile deal and, at first, the White Castle was empty, but minutes later, the hoards of hungry (and I think sober) people came pouring in. People eat at White Castle before 12am? And sober too? It was a revelation for me.The cashier was relatively friendly and the workers were churning up crave case after crave case, but we managed to get our meager 8 sliders, fries and onion rings in a decent amount of time. White Castle is White Castle, so I don't think I need to explain the quality of the food or how delicious it is no matter what time it is.

I'm not sure why they seemed annoyed because the restaurant was empty. How did these compare to the microwaveable ones I've had from the store? They tasted the same! Soggy and cheap. On second thought, the microwaveable versions are better because some of my burgers were cold in the middle. I had to spit some of those out.

Basically it's about the employee working there. I'm not sure what roles he plays, but the owners of this establishment should know that their counter person (man, light skin, black hair, above average weight) is a liability to their business. Clearly he has an issue with other Hispanic people (he claims to be Latino himself?) which has been highlighted by other reviews on Yelp. Not only is he a demeaning person, he also does it proudly and openly without a shred of worry about consequences.  He literally talks like a plantation owner (e.g., calls colored people ""boy"" with a slight southern accent) which is insane in 2022. This is the LES... it makes no sense to expose a business to this type of reputation around here. I think the owners should be aware and hopefully can shield themselves from any potential issues stemming from this employee's attitude. Thank you."

Began my love affair with Patacon Pisao during late night work thangs in Queens and they were pure bliss. Whether you order the Cachapas (which I recommend, get them all), or cubano or really anything, it's delicious. One shredded beef Cachapa usually lasts me 2 lunches or one big meal. Also, the prices have obviously increased over the years, but it's reasonable and like I said, this Venezuelan gem is a treasure. I wish I could eat here more, but it is on the heavier side, so I try to limit myself, but it's hard. I recently have been doing delivery from this LES location and it still arrives fresh, hot and once that savory and slight sweet from the cornbread hits you know you've made a right decision.  Don't forget to drizzle their sauces of course and the queens location offers tres leches, which was wonderful. I haven't tried it at this particular location yet, but I will if they offer it."

My favorite item is the Cachapa Pabellon, delicious and super filling. The place is quite small.. 3 small tables inside and a of couple tables outside. I would certainly recommend it for a fast, casual meal."

Kind of small, only 3 small tables and a couple seats outside... def smart to plan ahead during busy hours. Takeout worked well for me. The pabellon Patacon is my favorite because I'm obsessed  with plantains - you get sweet plantains, fried cheese, black beans and shredded pork sandwiched between 2 giant tostones. Prices went up a bit over the years but their portions have certainly remained consistent. In fact, my Patacon was so big I actually savored it over 3 meals. Good vibes and music playing"

I've been wanting to try these arepas for forever and my friend and I were looking for a casual quick bite before a concert so I decided to give it a try. They have a bowl of wipes for you to take so that helped a lot!I ordered the Paisa Arepa and requested for them to fry the egg rather than cooking it sunny side up. They did just that, thank you again!! There was a perfect balance of steak, chorizo, avocado, and sauce. The corn shell was nice and crispy; it remained crispy the whole time I was eating (and I eat slow) too! They also provide you with extra sauce. I added a little hot sauce and thoroughly enjoyed my messy meal. Definitely would return!"

I also got a sweet corn sandwich which I didn't like to much because it fell apart, but a fork and knife allowed me to get through the sandwich, alternatively, just fine. I would def come back here, most likely with an out of town person, for impressions and all."

She had awesome recommendations for cocktails and entrees. We had the papaya salad, spicy garlic noodles with pork, and imperial rolls. Although this restaurant is categorized under Vietnamese with a French twist, I think it's more so classic Vietnamese dishes with a few French dishes on the menu. A few items are a bit overpriced for what they are (why are 2 imperial rolls more than $10???), but servings are pretty generous and flavors are great! There's a beautiful garden patio seating area in the back that looked cozy, but the decor and vibes inside were welcoming and warm as well.Will definitely come back for the spicy garlic noodles!"

I believe it was their last day before they returned to Philly and I heard good things about this place so we decided to try it. It's usually pretty packed on the weekends for brunch so if you get their early, you'll find seating. It was summer so we sat in the back outdoor area. I believe they both got Bánh mì, my husband got the pho, and I got the fruit french toast. Everything was alright. But this isn't a place I'd go back just for the hell of it. The prices are extremely high and I'm not sure if it's worth the price. There are actual Vietnamese places that have better pho and better Bánh mì and much cheaper than this place. The food wasn't bad or anything, it's just overpriced. And also the service that so slow. It took them like 20 min to come around and take our orders. Our friends almost missed their train because it took so long. Honestly, I was really looking forward to this place but don't believe the hype around it. Slow service and overpriced food. I was not impressed."

Started off with the eggplant salads, which were fine. Then had summer rolls which hit the spot. The stars of the night were the pork belly buns and slow cooked lamb buns. We got three mains for the table. The Bourbon Battered Red Snapper, which was good to the last bite. The Flank Steak Hawker Noodles, were my favorite main. The Cumin Sesame Seed Marinated Chicken was solid, but my least favorite of the three. Overall we all left extremely stuffed and satisfied. I could not have asked for more. I'll be back for sure."

The food is served on a collection of vintage china.  They also have a very cute outdoor space.We stopped in for lunch. They have a lunch menu ending at 3:30 p.m.  We started off with the fresh summer rolls. They were good, but lacked a protein. Shrimp was an add on  option, and I would recommend adding it. The rolls were served with a thick peanut sauce, but it was very good. We also tried the crispy imperial rolls. They had pork and shrimp and definitely much tastier than the summer rolls.  We shared the lemongrass chicken bánh mì without jalapenos.  The portion was large and can be shared. It is quite spicy, so be prepared.   The chicken was amazing , so tender.  Service was ok, but not great.  We arrived close to 3, so there were only 2 other parties in the restaurant and our server was not very attentive."

Very fun vintage decor with lots of plants and old grandfather clocks. Would love to sit out there anytime we swing back by.For the food itself, I think they execute Vietnamese/Asian-infused flavors incredibly well into their menu. The Fried Chicken and Waffles had five spice chicken and sriracha butter, and their coconut milk french toast was divine. We also enjoyed their Pork Belly Hash and cocktail selection.I'm looking forward to coming back, and trying their banh mis as well as their dinner menu."

If you are not making the trip to eat at Bricolage while in Brooklyn, you are truly missing out on some AMAZING Southeast Asian barbecue. When I say Bricolage drops it like it's hot, ohhhhh boy, you better believe that plate is going to be sizzling with flavor!I went to meet up with a friend I haven't seen in a while last night & he chose this spot after checking out the menu. I trust his taste so I said, okay, let's do it! And we've got nooooo regrets. First off, the menu looked so darn good, we had so much trouble narrowing it down. I kid you not. And Bricolage did not make it easy because they had a huge selection of meats - duck, lamb, ribs, chicken, pork chops; you name it, they've got it!After making the difficult decision of finalizing our dishes, we were ready to feast. The staff was on point with timing - drinks came quick & food followed shortly after. Snap snaps for the chefs!Now let's talk about the food. The pork belly buns were like crack. I'm not a fan of fat in pork belly but let me tell you, the pork belly was charred and marinated so well, the meat just melted in my mouth. I have to say it's probably top 5 pork belly buns I've had. We had the ribs as our other appetizer & dude, it was doused in amazing marinade. Plus it was so easy to separate from the bone. The spicy garlic noodles were some of the best I've tasted; you definitely will get some heat from the hot peppers and you could tell the noodles were fresh because they were so smooth & chewy.  Bricolage didn't use traditional egg noodles for this dish; instead they changed up the game by using rice noodles that were a little thicker than vermicelli.Needless to say, our bellies were happily satisfied. We were super pleased with the service that we received as well. And the outdoor seating in the back is extremely cute - definitely worth checking out during the warmer months.Thank you Bricolage for an awesome dinner!"

Highly disappointed!After requesting to take pictures on the back where all the decor is; they made me stand up outside near on the door & took 2 pictures!There were so many people came after me without reservations & they were allowed to seat inside but for me they just made me seat on a corner on very humid & hot place infront ! I had been to much much beautiful places who has better tasted food & variations on the menu !People should do their google reviews very truthfully because it's important! Everyone doesn't have the luxury to spend a whole day traveling just to go to a place & have a horrible day!Now the food part, not many vegetarian options! Not many seafood either!And I do feel they have Racism issues ! They treat differently if you are not Asian ! Btw I am actually an Asian tooI guss me being a Muslim didn't help !Such a disappointment! I did heard good reviews from friends! Wanted to have a nice day all by myself but it was pretty ruined!

There was a backyard area with beautiful decor of hot pink and pale pink roses, as well as green leaves all around. We shared the truffle fries, which were only $8 and there was a generous portion. They were skinny fries, delightfully crisp, with strong potato-y and truffle taste. Truly addicting! I ordered the American Fried Rice, which was served with fried chicken, sunny side egg (which I requested to be cooked completely), as well as bacon. The fried rice was made with ketchup and raisins. The rice was cooked perfectly and tasted wonderfully flavorful. Normally I'm not a big fan of ketchup and raisins, but the ingredients paired well together. The fried chicken was absolutely delicious and well seasoned, with satisfyingly crisp skin, along with tender, juicy meat. The egg was also really good and the bacon had a nice crunch.I also got to try my friend's Thai Style Omelette with Crab Meat, over jasmine rice. The crab meat was quite yummy, flaky, and bursting with flavor. However, the rice underneath was really bland. Service was solid. Prices are pretty reasonable considering the area it is located in. I enjoyed my meal and would like to return for dinner to try the Waygu Truffle Garlic Fried Rice."

Both the dishes were very delicious!The salmon was well seasoned and not overcooked, eggs were delicious, loved the salad dressing on the salad (tasted like some light lime sauce concoction), and superb fries! The pad thai sunririse was very delicious too! The chicken was tender and well seasoned, the pad thai noodles were soft and well flavored. Portions were abundant which was good!

Pad Thai with shrimp - flavorful sauce, tender noodles, and yummy shrimp. My favorite is the Wagyu truffle garlic rice - our server helped to mix everything together, the Wagyu beef tasted like burger, rich in flavor and texture. We also ordered Thai ice tea and Lychee soda - Thai ice tea is fun to mix, they give you a bottle of huge ice cubes, tea, milk, and syrup (?); lychee soda also looks belle, decorated with blackberry and lemon, taste was a little on the bland side. Love the beautiful flowers around the place, dreamy and romantic. Service was quick, the only thing I wish they can improve  is they can be more flexible in terms of dining time. We were told that a table of two cannot be seated for longer than 90 minutes, we were a few minutes late for our reservation but apparently they started counting from the reservation time. Our overall time with our food is probably an hour or so. We were asked to leave even though we still hadn't finished our food and drinks...."

Then you go to the back and it's lovely! They have vines and flowers all over the walls and ceilings. It's quite magical and an amazing vibe. The staff is super friendly too!Pad Thai: 8.5/10This isn't my favorite pad Thai, but it was good. They add red cabbage and slices of apple, which I find untraditional but not distasteful. I thought the noodles were a bit thin and got stuck together. The sauce was very good though and the chicken and egg were very tasty after soaking it up.Thai tea: 10/10They deconstruct the Thai tea, and I LOVED it! Great idea. I  love that I could choose how much milk, tea, and sugar syrup to include. The tea is also made into ice cubes so you don't feel like your tea is getting watered down or is a rip off. I had plenty of tea for at least 1.5 of the glasses shown. Highly recommend!Truffle dumpling: 8/10The truffle dumplings were nice and crispy with plenty of filling. You could definitely taste the truffle. I wish the sauce wasn't so thick. I prefer my dumplings with a thinner sauce that can get inside and make the filling more juicy. Because the sauce was thicker it made the dumpling taste heavier and more dry.Chicken wings: 8/10The chicken wings were very small but there were a lot. I liked the flavor of the sauce. It was a nice spice level. I thought the chicken was juicy but the wings being so small were pretty soggy and not that crispy. Especially once the sauce got into them.Pumpkin curry: 8.5/10I really enjoyed the flavor of the pumpkin curry. It had some interesting vegetables: colorful cauliflower, bok choy, mushrooms, and pumpkin. The pumpkin wasn't cooked enough and was hard and tough instead of melting in my mouth. Overall I like the curry part but not so much the contents. Pinto Garden is a lovely place to get a drink and have a nice casual meal of Thai food. The Thai food isn't authentic and isn't ground breaking but it's good. I would come back for the vibe and a Thai iced tea!"

I would def go backMade the embarrassing mistake of ordering something as basic as the FRENCH TOAST (oopsie) at a THAI restaurant. I thought the Toast was overly drenched in syrup. I couldnt tell where the syrup ended and the toast began. The toast was just swimming in it. But my fault- my friend ordered the thai rice with eggs/chicken which looked great. Far superior choice. Anyway, I would definitely recommend. Understated from the outside- but a secret garden awaits you! Service was good- no rushing, no hovering- perfectly timed."

The host was clearly overwhelmed, received inadequate training or i don't know, because he was not doing a good job at maintaining the wait list. My party of 2 arrived and he asked us how many (to which my partner, standing next to me, said 2), then asked if there was anyone else with him (???????). He told us to have a seat & he'd be with us in a moment. Thought that was odd bc he didn't take our name/number. Other people who were there before us were losing their patience, as he kept asking the same groups, every few minutes, how many people were in their party. One woman mentioned they were waiting for over 2 hours; that is asinine. He wasn't offering any explanation to anyone, just repeating ""give me a second.""He lead us to a table, to which I asked for a napkin to wipe the seat bc there were crumbs on it. He looked at me partner and asked him ""what does she want?"" My partner repeated my request, and he mumbled under his breath as he went to get a napkin. At this point, I told him I'd do it myself, as my patience was thinning by the second.My omelet was dry. On the menu it stated it came with sour cream and salsa, but did not receive it with my order. I got the waitress's attention to notify her of this, and she said ""you want salsa and sour cream?"" Um...yes I do. The container barely had any of both condiments. My partner said his pancakes were dry. At that point, we were over it, got the bill even before I finished my meal, paid it and left. Never again."

But the lines move quickly. The staff is patient with indecisive customers.Sandwiches & Wraps: A simple hero or roll will cost you between $5-7. Some specialty items and bigger sandwiches will cost you $7-10Hot Bar: I have yet to try their hot bar which offers platters, rice, noodles etc. While it looks delicious the sandwich bar won me over.Credit Card: $10 minimum for cardsDrinks: Standard prices for drinks mostly $1-2 some costing $3-4Seating: There is room to sit 28 people. A few tables are single, most are double so if they are crowded expect to sit next to strangers.Cleanliness: The place is fairly clean. Chefs are constantly wiping down surfaces and cutlery. The staff often cleans the tables and wipes them down as well.OVERALL: I would highly recommend Hero Champ. It's steps away from the hipster food court of Industry City. There is a deli just across the street but I have not had any desire or urge to check them out, as Hero Champ satisfies my hunger needs. I visit them 2-3 times a week for my work lunches."

It was a blustery night, so we ducked into this unassuming bar for a drink to pass the time, and we enjoyed it so much we came back after dinner for round two!The bartenders were both super friendly and really efficient. The drinks were really tasty and they had some really fun names! They had board games and card games for us to play. They did a really good job of creating a warm and inviting atmosphere, all while dishing up some really creative and delicious drinks. I'll definitely be back next time I'm out and about in the UES!"

Always fun with a group get together. My friends all ordered old fashioneds and said they were terrible. You could tell the bartenders don't really know how to make classic cocktails here. Glad I stuck with beer instead."

Workshop is a pretty small bar but usually has enough seating. Busy for happy hour and trivia night. There's also free games you can play. Fun place for hanging out a bit. I was bored so we checked it out and had a few drafts. The one I picked was by Threes Brewery, the I Hate Myself IPA. It's appropriate. It's $9 for a pint. That's quite a lot and a knock on this place. Overall it was a good beer. This has flavors of candied peach, jackfruit, pine resin, and white grapefruit orangina. How could I taste all these flavors? The menu said these were the flavor notes. Cool place for hanging awhile. It doesn't have any bar snacks like pretzels or anything to slow your pace but you can bring in food. They also have trivia night which seems to be popular."

This was less than a block away with just enough seating for the three of us on a Sunday night. It was a cozy place with music and tv screens playing sports. It was not loud, allowing us to have conversations without screaming at one another. There was only one bartender, but she was efficient. I never felt that I waited for my drinks for too long. They have happy hour all day Sunday. But we opted for cocktails that weren't on the menu. The blueberry whiskey sour was very good and for only 12 dollars! I also had a glass of Pinot Grigio that was a good pour for 9! Rarely am I on the UES, but if I find myself nearby, I'll stop by for another drink."
2942,dfuedxl8OncQJuF_SWNKig,11/30/2019,3 star rating,"I visited around 9:00 on a Saturday night and it was a little busy but not uncomfortably so. Atmosphere: I found the interior to be cute and cozy, with dim lighting and candles and lights strung around. Plus, quirky decor and an indie pop soundtrack!Service: there were two bartenders working and both were friendly enough for the situation. Drinks: I usually drink beer but felt like having a cocktail on this visit. There are many cocktails on the list, ranging from $10-14. They have several different flavored gin and vodka tonics so I decided to have a tart cherry tonic, which featured gin, tart cherry, lemon, and tonic. It was okay. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly flavorful either. For my next round, I decided to go with a negroni and it seemed oddly heavy, like maybe there was too much vermouth?  I'm not sure what was going on but I got a blast of soda water added to it and it was more balanced out. I kinda wish I'd gone with a beer because they have a pretty good looking craft list. Next time!"

So I came here to add to the breakfast I already ordered. Don't judge me. I got the cornmeal porridge which was really good. I'm Caribbean, so some porridge in the morning always hits the spot. I like that it wasn't too sweet. I also got one of their house beverages. No, not the wine! Cause they're a juice bar. *Looks everyone directly in the eye*It was the sea moss and it was so good! It's made with almond milk and nutmeg and all those warm delicious flavor notes. If y'all catch me on another day.....I would've added rum to it. But...I had vodka earlier.

I was introduced to them by a friend who lived walking distance from their Crown Heights location and I've been hooked ever since.When leaving the gym one afternoon, I walked down Church Ave and nearly knocked someone over so that I could take a good look at what I believed to be a new Natural Blend location. The universe truly answers us because I always said I wished for there to be a Natural Blend in Flatbush and it is finally here!Okay, let me get the point of what people actually wanna hear about: ""the food."" The breakfast porridges are delicious. My favorite is the 7-grains porridge. Very hearty and filling. Even better if you get it with a pastry, like banana bread or lemon tart. The Ital stew is any vegan/vegetarian's dream. It's curry, packed with veggies, potatoes, pimento, and all the other amazing things that a Jamaican soup usually consists of but without meat. Don't get me started on the patties! The pumpkin and 'fish' are flaky, buttery, and too scrumptious!! Just get there already. Much love to Natural Blend! Sincerely, your favorite customer, hehe :)"
2952,vdaZ82A0z4J8Ftv60ZccFw,12/14/2019,5 star rating,"I'm so glad I passed by Natural Blend. This restaurant focuses on foods that are vegan/vegetarian/pescatarian friendly. Having Natural Blend as an alternative food option in the area is a definite plus compared to all of the fast food places in the surrounding blocks. The space itself is very nice. There are enough tables to dine in or even do work on the computer. I was in the mood for something light today, so I opted to get the ""Kale Mary"" smoothie. The smoothie was delicious! The prices are also very reasonable, and the ladies who work at the counter were very pleasant! I'd definitely be back again to try some of the vegan entrees!"

I have been a vegan for a few years now and I've come to accept the acquired taste of vegan cheese, but this Mac and cheese had NO TASTE at all, not even a lick of seasoning. I was so disappointed. However I did also order the fresh bread which was extremely delicious, super soft and yummy."

The food was absolutely delicious, i had the shrimp gyro and it was yummy. The rest of my kids and husband had the chicken shawarma. I don't eat meat, but based on how fast they ate their food i was able to tell that it was great especially because my boys are picky eaters. The service was great, the staff were nice and inviting. I love it here, my only regret is not coming here sooner."
2958,azCB19UzoGl7njg5FDudaw,2/9/2023,3 star rating,We stopped by Sumac as we had a yearning for falafel. My wife ordered pickled vegetables and a falafel sandwich and I ordered the falafel sandwich and a lamb gyro sandwich. We received a Meze platter and a side order of pickles and the sandwiches. The stuffed rice grape leaves are served very hot which we were not accustomed to and the lamb gyro had a hot Mayo type dressing. The pitas were a little old. Overall the food was decent but not outstanding. Price was a little steep at $64 (w/credit card fees). The service was excellent and kitchen is very clean.

2960,azCB19UzoGl7njg5FDudaw,8/27/2021,4 star rating,"Finally a Mediterranean restaurant that serves tahini sauce. There other sauce is a white Mayo type sauce, Which is pretty good. It's a wrapped Pita but at least it's a pita!! They don't toast the pita bread. They are Gyro (lamb) is very good the kebab (beef) and I would preferred My meat more chard.  They're not perfect however there's no place else on Staten Island you can get a decent tahini sauce on your kebab or anything else for that matter. The next problem is you asked for tahini sauce and they will forget to put it in the bag. YOU absolutely must check to make sure that you got your tahini sauce you ordered on the side."

And then Yelp has a coupon for a little precent off the offer, when I presented it.. She said has to leave a good review first and then she would do it. For $4?? Or $5!!?? Not worth lying about it.. I told her I'll pay the extra money.. But my reviews are honestly and straight forward.. She had good food.. Only thing was my date and me ordered two different dishes. The plates looked the same??? Food was GOOD & tasteful! Service was bilingual.. Poor Spanglish skills and improperly trained.. Not her fault, if the owner wasn't to busy smoking his hookah & only put more effort in te business.. Maybe! We would have a success!"

We have tried almost everything on the menu and haven't been disappointed. Chicken shawarma is one of my favorite. Falafel sandwich is delicious too. The first time we came we weren't crazy about the sumac fried with all the toppings now we sometimes come here just because of them. Great and very friendly staff.

2966,azCB19UzoGl7njg5FDudaw,2/26/2014,5 star rating,"From the outside looking in nothing about this place really causes it to stand out.  I've been told by regular they never see people come in and out but theyre still staying busy so I assume they make a killing from delivery and within the first 15 minutes of being thereI was proven right; the phone didn't stop ringing and the delivery kid was all over the place.After being seated our order was taken for appetizers and entre as well. We couldn't figure out what the menu exactly was country wise it was Mediteranean but wasn't country-specific. It seemed to cover Lebanon Syria and a lot of North African countries and also Greece. I asked the girl behind the counter where they hailed from and she said they were Egyptian.Our appetizer was lamb shawarma with fresh hummus with a fresh baked pita on the side. It was an ample portion for 2 people and I probably could have done with one more pita but cooler heads prevailed knowing that I ordered the mixed meat grill; I had high hopes. The hummus was freshly ground chickpeas I could tell cause it was a couple of chickpeas that had escaped the grinding it was garlicky lemony with some green herbs. The lamb itself was crispy and tender on the inside. the mixed meat grill consisted of lamb chops, minced meat kofta, grilled beef grilled chicken and shavings of lamb shawarma. It was served on a bed of yellow rice and a side salad of tomato cucumber and lettuce. The entree itself was good for 2 people but I will probably order double just in case. There's a nice selection of dessert and Mediterranean Teas. The service was good and kept coming back to us asking whether you were happy. This is definitely a smaller operation so be patient it's definitely worth the while.There is a free delivery as well good to know. As a first time review of Sumac I would highly recommend this place. This is a mom-and-pop organization and support small business! stop nitpicking and enjoy a taste from a different part of the world"

These are delicious; but small portion I haven't enjoyed any other dishes. I was so disappointed they stopped serving the fried curry salmon. The view is nice and the staff is friendly.
1,URflNuIV5PJZm4LcNACBPQ,12/4/2022,5 star rating,Went here for the first time and will definitely be back. Not only was the food delicious but so was the atmosphere. We went in the winter but I imagine this place is amazing in the summer. It's right in the water with a nice patio/bar area.  The food was so good too!
2,URflNuIV5PJZm4LcNACBPQ,3/31/2023,3 star rating,Food and drinks were delicious as always. Service was terrible. Add on kitchen fee?? Waited an hour for our check. Did not have a set waitress there was two women waiting all the tables on a busy Friday night. No one ever came to offer us a refill or see how our food was. It took us getting up and asking one of the waitresses for our check and a to-go box. Again an hour after we finished eating. They passed by us frequently as we were seat next to the bar and a couple next to us whom came in after us got there check before we did. Better off sticking to delivery or take out.

It has a patio with a retractable roof.So was our plan, we came here. But not everything goes as you planned. We sat a corner table, so we enjoy the view and weather. Right after we sat down, they decided. To close the roof. I said why? Oh their reply was the table next to us requested to close. Oh excuse me, i am a paying customer, you should ask everyone if it is ok. Second, they have indoor seating, if you don't want sun hit your face, go the f..k sit inside. Well that roof never got opened back until we leave.Food is incredible, had the calamari and mango salad. Then pineapple shrimp fried rice and tofu pad Thai. For desert fried ice cream and fried banana.Also, when we asked for the check, i saw gratuity added to my bill. You got some nerve!!! Don't please me but add the service charge!!! Terrible service!

6,URflNuIV5PJZm4LcNACBPQ,12/21/2022,2 star rating,"The portion sizes are shockingly small, especially for the price. Which would be tolerable if the food were at least tasty. I have NEVER eaten such bland food and for it to be Thai, a cuisine typically known for its deliciousness, this was a travesty of tastelessness. The crispy veggie rolls? Bland. The basil fried rice? Bland. I had to sprinkle seasoning on everything. The pad see ew? A touch of flavor. The Thai iced tea wasn't so bad but it was such a tiny portion for $5 I felt like I was being robbed! I ordered it without ice so maybe they decided to give me the amount that would be left without ice in it which if so? Petty. If that was the actual amount? Shameful. This was overall a disappointing experience."
7,URflNuIV5PJZm4LcNACBPQ,9/19/2022,1 star rating,Absolutely disgusting!!!!I will only recommend getting vegetables dishes  because everything else is old. Last night I order the jumbo chicken... OMG!!!!! It tastes like it's been spoiled for months now and they just season it to mask the smell. When I send it back to the kitchen they try to give me an old shrimp dumpling as a replacement. One thing I love about seafood is that the smell will always tell you when it has gone bad. Seems like the owners are too greedy to throw away old/ spoiled food.
8,URflNuIV5PJZm4LcNACBPQ,5/3/2022,5 star rating,I love taking people out to this spot because of the view. You can also take a ride on the jet skis before you eat your food. Make sure to come here during the sunset so you can get the best experience. I love the thai tea from this spot. The waiters are very respectful and will give you their best opinion on the food. If you go to rockaway beach make sure to check this spot out!The duck was good and the fried rice came in large portions. I was not disappointed.

I was livid but said ""whatever"" back to her and she seemed to have gotten annoyed by my reply. Management needs to retrain her or fire her."
12,NbbsBvKddxR9OV4TBChY7A,3/28/2022,3 star rating,This is a pretty typical McDonald's that serves pretty typical McDonald's food.  This McDonald's however is unreasonably slow at times and sometimes has a line almost out the door to order. They often turn their self-ordering kiosks off leaving your only option to go to the counter which has a line or sometimes no worker at all. When you finally place your order it also takes a while to come out. This location is also very inconsistent in whether their upstairs dining area is open as there is not much space to sit downstairs. I was extremely disappointed when I went during Saint Patricks Day and was unable to get a Shamrock Shake. This ruined my day as I was looking forward to a nice minty green shake. Visiting this location makes me all the more nostalgic for the other McDonald's location near 74th street that shut down years ago.

We came here for takeout and the service was fairly quick. You can dine-in or takeout. The ambience was chill. There's a good amount of seating. Staff was friendly and accommodating. The place was clean. There's no doubt about it that we chose the best pizza I've had in a long time. The slices are a decent size and the taste makes you want a whole pie to yourself. Slices are about $4 each. They offer a selection of sodas and juices. They offer specialty pizzas in addition to, regular pizzas, salads, calzones, appetizers, hero's, wraps, pasta dishes. For extra toppings it's about $3-$3.50 per topping. I'd highly recommend for the food, service, and taste! I'd definitely come back again when it town."
29,ynQ8NJB7SEAIkuUxopHPvA,3/2/2023,1 star rating,"When it's good, it's REALLY good, but when it's bad, good god! The 1-star is only because I feel bad for them. They are a neighborhood pizzeria that I want to support, but my guess is their rent is so high by now, that they have to just crank out the pies, factory-style. I've ordered from them on and off for the past few years. Most recently, I ordered 3x in a 2-month period or so. Twice the pie arrived a soggy, raw-doughy mess with tomato sauce all over the place despite requesting ""extra crispy."" The box in which it came already felt heavy in a weird way. Thats because the extreme sogginess of the pie went right through the cardboard smearing all over my kitchen counter. Since then, I've begun firing up my oven when I order from them in anticipation of a poor quality pie -- I've come to expect poor quality everything in NYC given the rents being charged, small businesses don't really stand a chance here anymore. They did give me a credit, but when it's so hit or miss on a $45 pie each time I order, I can't justify continuing to order from them as much as I want to support local.It's really too bad that this neighborhood has become what it has. A place that must primarily cater to tourists, i.e., who cares if they're served up inferior products; tourists are not repeat customers. And who cares if locals are annoyed, it's not like the other local pizzerias serve any better product (they don't)."

We were able to get seated right away, which was one of the few positives about the experience. We had multiple servers in a row come over to tell us the same thing. This would have been just comical but one of the waiter/hosts said he would go get dessert for us from a neighbouring place but never did. That would have been a better use of one of the waitress's time than needlessly coming over.My friends enjoyed the food (stuffed mushrooms and a salad to start), but I thought it was all mediocre. Worst of all was the bland veggie pizza: the toppings slid immediately off when I picked up a slice. Total disappointment."
31,ynQ8NJB7SEAIkuUxopHPvA,12/27/2022,4 star rating,"If you're visiting DUMBO and in ""pizza junction"", don't let Juliana's and Grimaldi's be your only two options! Ignazio is an oft forgotten gem right around the corner, but has even better pizza. Their ""The Pizza"" offering is a crispy pie that sticks to a few simple ingredients, but does things a little different than usual. The pie has more of a breadstick type crust, so it does not have the strongest depth of flavor, but makes up for it with an outstanding crunch. The sauce is really great and possibly the best quality of their pie. It is more on the tart side, but is well complimented with the oregano and other herbs on top. It works really well and tastes complex even for a basic pie.I've tried Grimaldi's and Julianna's about thrice each, and have done the same for Ignazio's. I can definitely say Ignazio's is the strongest of the three. However, my only criticism is that they could try and be a bit more consistent, as I did bring a friend once and we were disappointed to get kind of soft, soggy pizza instead of the usual crispy pie. Or perhaps this place does slices better than pies? I'll happily get another pie soon to know! Maybe it was just a one time mistake.The inside is quite chill, they have a cute little bar as well so it's a nice place to go with friends. Service is usually pretty smooth, and the dude (was it the owner?) hanging outside and talking to folks who ordered a slice was pretty chill.Overall a very underrated place! With the new L&B opening nearby I hope folks do not overlook it even more. I try to direct tourists here from time to time when I walk past the long lines for Julianna's and Grimaldi's."

The flavor and the amount of white clam on the pizza should make it soggy but it isn't.  The Pizza is not your average pizza, fresh, crusty and of course I did check off ""well done"" on my order preference so if that's what you like make sure you do the same.  The garlic bread is so awesome that it never made it home, as my 11 yo wolfed it down on the ride home.  I would try them again and when I picked up the pizza I checked the interior space and it is more spacious than Juliana's and have better view too.  I would not over this hidden gem if you are in the area.  This review is done by a local Brooklynite and not a tourist so take it how you will!"

I first stumbled on this place years ago when making the journeys to try the infamous Grimaldi's around the corner and didn't want to deal with the long 3 hour wait. This time would make it a solid 10th time and the pizza choice is still as good as I remember it. With the pandemic, there's an added option of outdoor dining now and they take credit cards too instead of just cash. Service is a bit slow when getting our server's attention since they may not be used to servicing customers dining outside. This didn't overall take away from the main experience and as an added bonus, who can honestly say they could have Brooklyn pizza with a closeup view of the Brooklyn Bridge in DUMBO. Yup if you need pizza options after touring DUMBO and need a place to sit, come here."

I lowkey almost gave up on brunch bc the last two places I went were lowkey overwhelming + just honestly places you should go to for din instead BUT Claudette led me back to my brunch ways We got the avo toast, wild mushroom omelette, Camembert and eggs, pommes frites, and Provençal olive oil flatbread. My avo toast was SO GOOD. Lowkey was skeptical at first bc the avo wasn't really smashed up and looked hard and cold, but the seasonings made everything so good -- it was tangy and a little sour and  little spicy and really creamy all at the same time, and the poached egg tied everything together. Pommes frites were excellent and the dijonaisse sauce was perffff wish they gave a little more tho. Provençal flatbread was good too -- at first we thought it was lowkey just naan but it was honestly really firm yet chewy and the olive oil was top tier. My friends liked their other mains tooFor dessert, we got the île flottante, which is basically this cream merengue dessert that was amazing and fluffy and had a really tempered sweetnessService was amazing the server was honestly our friend by the end of it Will def come here again hopefully for din SUCH A GOOD BRUNCH SPOT!!!!"

41,aTFkjo0scqmOgsFF5kuGXg,1/3/2023,5 star rating,"This restaurant is very on the line between a 4 or a 5 for me but just tips over to a 5. We came for brunch on a Sunday and easily got a reservation a day or so prior at a decent time. The interior aesthetic says upscale southern coastal vibes to me. Think, beige and cream. It's very open and there is quite a lot of seating. A nice place to come with a group of 2-4! Also seems very quiet, a good place to have a conversation. Add this as a spot to bring your parents if they are in town visiting.For food, we got the flatbread with the olive tapenade + pistacio tapenade. you can tell the flatbread is house-made and fresh. I absolutely loved it. We also split the french toast and the camembert and eggs. I have to say, I was very impressed with the food. I think it really speaks on the quality of the food when simple dishes are done well and the eggs were some of the best, fluffiest eggs I've had in awhile. When they were delivered to the table I was ready to load up on the S&P. They were so good and well seasoned that I didn't even need to add any! I was shocked. That bite of egg mixed with the creamy cheese on bread was everything I needed on a Sunday morning. My roommate was a huge fan of the french toast. For me it was good but slightly dry and needed more syrup. Still a nice option though. For drinks, my friend got an oat milk latte that she really enjoyed and I got a lychee iced tea. I was not a big fan of my tea and I would not recommend it, especially at $10. The service was great. The manager even came over to greet an check on us at one point. Overall, a great option for brunch and I look forward to trying their dinner. 4.6/5"

Food was solid but I was a little disappointed that Happy Hour was only available at the bar (had I know, we wouldn't have gone for the 5:15 seating). We were seated outside and the heat lamp are high quality! We did not feel cold at all even though it was probably 40 degrees outside. Appetizers - we ordered the truffle hummus, squash & fig, haricots vert, and brussel sprouts. I really liked the hummus (solid amount and you can definitely taste the truffle) and the brussel sprouts (very crispy and the flavors were great). The squash & fig and haricot verts were ok but didn't really stand out. For my entree, I (as well as three other people in my party) got the bouillabaisse, we all thought it was pretty good. There were generous amount of seafood (large chunk of seabass and also delicious giant prawns) and I really like the bread with aioli that also came with it. Although my one criticism was the lobster & tomato broth was a bit on the salty side. For drinks, I had the Pink Flamingo and Moroccan Margarita - both pretty decent although I liked the margarita more."

I was drawn to Awash in particular because its menu has customizable platters where you can choose the meats included and what size, since I think Ethiopian food is most fun when you get a giant platter to communally eat with your group. My friend and I came at peak dinnertime on Friday, but luckily there wasn't a wait and the servers seem to keep things moving. The inside of the restaurant is quite dim but nicely decorated with cool lamps, baskets, tablecloths, and a real candle at each table (watch out for it when you grab at your food!).We ordered an Awash combo for two that came with two generous servings of kitfo, special tibs (sauteed beef), lentils, collard greens, and beets. I found the tibs a bit tough and would get the other beef option next time, but the kitfo was DELICIOUS and I'm glad they gave such a large portion of it. Don't be afraid to try it because it's raw beef - it's kind of like the consistency of sushi spicy tuna, and amazingly buttery and seasoned. The platter is plenty of food for two and I'm happy to have leftovers for tomorrow. It takes a little while for the food to come out here, which was also the case at my favorite Ethiopian spot in Philly so maybe it's something to do with the cooking. We also had to flag down a server a couple times for water, which I needed since the food can get quite spicy. However, I wouldn't mind making this my regular Ethiopian spot - love the combos and the kitfo, and I need to return to try the lamb and honey wine!"

This is a restaurant you steer clear away from Manhattan for dinner.It is not the prices, those were okay. It is not the accessibility by subway, that is first rate. It is the service I received, for the food that I received. The food is decent, but it looks too white tablecloth here. Too neat, too pretty, and it looked scared to be eaten. It felt like I was eating eggshells. If the meal does not feel right, it will not taste right. After all, we eat with our eyes as much as we eat with our brains.As for the service, it leaves more to be desired. My server was pretty rude, especially when I asked for suggestions. I like to ask the servers what they think is good. Is it too much to give an honest opinion? You would have thought I asked her to marry me without even asking her on another date. I felt insulted.To add more insult to injury, I felt like an alien bug that had to be squashed immediately. When another customer came in that she knew, she was all jolly and friendly. To me, I was watched the entire time like I was under surveillance. Yes, I cheated a little to use a fork to eat some of this, but here? I do not care. The heck with it here.When she did come back to check on me, she asked me if I wanted more injera. I said sure, thinking it would be free. But no, this is Manhattan. I noticed when I received my bill they charged me extra for more. That is a crying shame. No where else since I started trying this cuisine has done this, and no one treated me like a second class citizen as I was treated here.Since the food is decent, that is the only reason I am saving this review from being a one star review. One thing is for sure, I am sticking with the Brooklyn location."

I ordered a beef, chicken, and vegetable combo as per usual and my mom ordered something similar but with lamb in it. We both also ordered only gluten-free bread and those were the only two orders we made that night. Of course, the food was great but it came in 45 minutes late and they only did one small side of the gluten-free bread and they gave a huge side of the bread with gluten in it which made absolutely no sense. Why would we want any of the bread with gluten in it if no one ordered it as a side or in general? We ended up throwing out the bread and sharing the small side because no one could eat it. It was a waste of bread, which was also a disappointing thing. I love this restaurant, and I hope to come back in the future, but this experience wasn't good."

It wasn't the best Ethiopian food I had, especially coming from Hawaii, they are legit way better Ethiopian foods on Oahu, but this is not the worst food. When it comes to their service, it was just nasty. I've noticed that they are kind to Caucasian customers. But they were very cold and unkind to me, and I was the only asian there that night. When I was ready to check out, they told me they don't accept discover cards. But I only brought that one credit card and didn't bring any cash. The waitress forced and escorted me to go to the grocery store next door to withdraw cash. And when she saw I was charged $1.99, she said: oh it's ok. Just $1.99. When we came back, I called their manager, and offered to have them cover the atm fee. But they did not cover it, and they demanded me for tips while lecturing me: if you use a discover card, you need to tell us in advance. I told her, no, I don't, because on the door, there's sigh saying they accept all cards."

Their cocktails were also very unique and had a nice twist to them. Servers were very kind and made great recs. 4/5 stars because the service is usually quite slow (although everyone is super kind and as long as you're not in a rush it's just more reason to enjoy!), and the bathrooms were not clean.

The fried pickles that came with the ribs were surprisingly good too - I never eat fried pickles, but enjoyed these quite a bit.The beer flight here I found to be a great value, you can try 4 beers for $12! And they had a decent selection on draft with some rotating options. That said, they had a wide variety of canned/bottled stouts (not surprised!).

The pretzel was large & not Bavarian but still satisfying. I sprang $2 for the cheese sauce & it was worth it. My son said the burger on brioche was just average, but it looked pretty good from my vantage point. The beer selection is excellent too. You can order with your server or digitally off your phone after scanning the code on your table. I'd recommend a visit for a ballgame viewing."

The past month I've been staying in FIDI before my move to Texas and have been beyond impressed with the level of service and quality of this location.  Bartenders (Devin, Alexa, Ori and Nick) all remember you by name, have your drink ready for you and are always open for conversation while still making sure everyone feels welcome and acknowledged.  Claire is great and runs a great crew making sure everything is perfectly executed. Food is high quality and consistent.  I am a very simple customer and went with the sliders as my main meal and they were phenonmenal. Stout is great for a post work happy hour, a work lunch or Weekend brunch.  Highly recommend Stout as one of my favorite spots in The City."

Leave the blame game in 2022 please and thank you We paid for a table almost over $600. STAFF of STOUT passed our table twice to offer rice balls and some onion pizza (once each ). We didn't get bottle service until after 1am and we were there since 10:30-11pm. Each staff member including both managers kept blaming it on the communication between the restaurant and the event planner. No juice, no water, nothing. We kept paying for individual drinks until they figured out what the issue is with bottles we already paid for. Then when they figured out we already paid for the bottles, they ran out and didn't have what we requested/paid for. IDGAF who's fault it is - we are the customers- just serve us until you guys figure out your communication. Hot mess. And I bet the manager will respond to this with an automated message about sending them a private message so they could work it out or they'll completely ignore this You guys were a hot mess.

We had the pao de queijo as well the beef and ham and cheese empanadas as starters. The pao de queijo comes with a gauva sauce on the side that is so amazing and even more so when you smear it all over the pao. The empanadas were flakey and super flavorful. I had the bauru as a my main - the filet mignon was seasoned and cooked to perfection and the bread was toasted and crunchy. For drinks we ordered a pitcher of caipirinha (like flavored) which was super refreshing. I think this is such a great spot and will definitely be back probably more in the summer as the caipirinha would be amazing on a hot day.

Also, I ordered the side of salsa, which for $4.00 I did expect to come with chips. Instead I received just a 1/4 full small cup of salsa. For the price vs return, it was a bit disappointing."

They've got a more spacious layout that allows them to have 2-4 people tables rather than the individual booths that some New York ramen spots have which was so nice to be able to sit and talk with friends. The waiters consistently checked on us to fill our waters and keep things moving and our food came out so fast after placing our orders! I got the Tom Yum Ramen and it was exactly what I wanted. It was the perfect blend of spicy and tangy flavors, the chicken was well cooked and still nice and tender, the noodles weren't over cooked and had a bit of firmness left to them, and the soft boiled egg really topped it off. I don't make it up to New York often, but this is definitely a place I would return to on future trips! Highly recommend if you're in the mood for good ramen!"

Although not the most authentic, it's tasty and filling. It's hard to find decent ramen lower than $15 in the city these days. I've tried both the Ajisen Ramen and the Tenderous Rib Ramen. While the ribs are good, some pieces are too tough for me so I prefer the Ajisen Ramen more (at a cheaper price!). The pork bone broth is very flavorful and rich. The Aijsen ramen comes with half a soft-boiled egg and 3 pieces of 'chashu'. Their version of chashu is a lot leaner than what you would expect at other restaurants, but it's still tender.Another highlight is their fried calamari. It's fried fresh and is sooo crispy and tasty! It's good with or without the sweet Thai chili sauce that is served on the side. I've also had their pork buns before, which I thought were alright. For $10, I highly recommend getting the fried calamari as an appetizer with your bowl of ramen.I'll definitely be back before the ramen weather ends!"

A day has passed and I can't stop thinking of it. I ordered it because its a non-traditional flavor, I waited about 15 mins-ish. My reactions:Interesting...Let's try the chicken firstThe broth is kind of salty maybe let's just mix everything togetherJ A C K P OT The chicken was everything I wanted it to be tender, good size, and just the right amount of sweetness. Once I stirred the broth which contained sprouts, scallions, noodles, medium size egg, & ofcourse the chicken, it was an immaculate experience. The lightly salted broth with the combination of Teriyaki sweetness. The broth may look heavy but it's light, I'd say in a range it would be 3/10 with 10 being heavy. The noodles are thin and a perfect amount. Overall 10/10 great amount of protein & carbs. GREAT pricing too. I literally forgot there were other people in the room, as I was also watching a show.

Crispy but not oily, with a very light sauce that didn't drown the tofu but gently flavored the crunchy crust. The ramen, however was very disappointing. The spicy tonkatsu was all heat and not much flavor, the noodles were lackluster and the char siu was bland.  The tofu was good- maybe this was just an off night for the ramen chef, so giving them 3 stars."

That's bad, if they can't clean these,  what about their kitchen, I doubt it's clean. my Ajisen ramen was tonkotsu soup today and tasted good, smell good and very hot. Noodles was cooked Al dente just how it should be, and texture and taste good. 3 thin slices of charsiu tasted great. It's plain but many toppings choice. I will try rice menus next time and I hope they notice that they must keep everywhere clean including condiments."

I got the tender ribs ramen and it was the softest ribs I ever had! Maybe the broth was a little too salty but not too bad. Very good for the cold weather.

Everyone was incredibly nice and accomodating. They bent over backwards to make sure we were able to get a table, even after we constantly had to delay them. The food and drinks were great as well. Everything from the complimentary chips and salsa to the Enchiladas del Norte, coconut margarita, and flautas we ordered were very enjoyable. The restaurant is a bit small so keep that in mind if necessary. Overall, I had an amazing night with friends and definitely want to return to try more items from their menu."

Every time I come here the hosts act like your non-existent but it's ok, I come for the nachos and margaritas! Nachos were the bomb yo! Loaded with plenty of chicken and melted cheese, more than enough to share with a fellow compadre. Margaritas were equally explosive, tasted great, no over-pour (please not at lunch). The server came around often to refill our dranks and they weren't stingy with extra salsa. Been here several times, definitely a Forest Hills favorite when I come visit."
92,j4dGkqL-OK9YH8Sl2eOWEg,10/9/2022,4 star rating,Order:- Chicken Enchilada (4/5)- Al Pastor Tacos (5/5)- Strawberry Frozen Margarita (4/5)- Mango Frozen Margarita (4/5)Pros:- Great tasting food - Large portion sizes - A lot of unique options to choose from off of the menu - You can mix and match different proteins if you get tacos - Free chips and salsa for the table Cons:- Very busy. You will probably have to wait for a seat - Small restaurant; I hope you don't mind sitting shoulder to shoulder with other people - Service can be a bit slow since the restaurant is very busy - A little more expensive than what I had expected Overall: Great tasting food. I will definitely come again but I recommend trying to beat the dinner rush

I like it. The food is alwaysss delicious! I have no complains except I didn't realize my chicken enchiladas was sooo spicey. I don't like so spicey only a little. I guess I just though I can handle it. But no I had to only eat the inside of it. I won't order that again.I been here couple of times so this won't stop me from going again. Service is always great and kind. They are pretty fast with their service. I have no complaints. The sauce and chips I always eat it all lol! I will definitely still be coming here!

97,j4dGkqL-OK9YH8Sl2eOWEg,8/8/2022,4 star rating,"5 Burro Cafe has been a mainstay in the Forest Hills dining scene and through its popularity has become one of the most recognized establishments in the borough. Through their drinks and festive ambiance, this has been a reliable choice for a place to check out day or night. It can feel tight in here and with good reason: it's like a slightly wider than average hallway of two top tables and a decked out bar for good measure. The decor is no doubt convivial with memorabilia with a little Mexican vibe and lots of photos, license plates, and beverage logos. It can also get really hot in here when there's too many folks, which can get hectic in a hurry. (#1)Drinks are the primary reason I come here. Their frozen margaritas have amassed quite a reputation in the community for being refreshing and incredibly potent. They have a stellar selection of spirits, including lots of tequila and mezcal for those who are looking for some added fun to the experience. If the choices are too overwhelming, aim for a 72oz pitcher for $34-36 and split it with 3 people. That's a good amount of booze for not very much money.Mexican food in NY has always been a struggle for out of towners and the food here is unlikely to change their minds (#2). The salsas, tacos, nachos, brunch plates, huevos rancheros, chimichangas are so-so in the grand spectrum of what's available in the area, but they're good enough in a pinch after consumption of alcoholic beverages. For some folks in FoHi, this is the most Mexican joint they'll ever find but for many others, this is just okay at best. My advice would be to enjoy a drink or three and finish it off with a plate of something hearty. I would predict little to no regrets, post consumption. __________(#1) Which also means: a long wait for seating.(#2) California, Texas, and any place with a solid Mexican community, you've been warned."

I personally thought the omakase menu was worth every penny. It was $120, but is now $150.We both got two drinks each, the Greenwich and Long Peach, and ended up really liking the cocktails. Love the Asian twists!The prix fixe menu was not limited to nigiri only, but had grilled/fried items and soups. Sashimi slices were fresh and melted in my mouth without any taste of fishiness. The variety definitely kept the meal interesting! Tangerine sorbet in the end acted as a refreshing palate cleaner.Overall, I highly recommend Towa. Everything tasted pretty solid. I appreciate the consistency from start to finish. My belly was super happy in the end!"
99,5ZgCfc1_fotAKUp7n3YJkQ,3/12/2023,2 star rating,"Service was a bit awkward. Although our reservation was for the a la carte menu in the dining room the hostess kept asking if we wanted to sit at the omakase bar since they didn't have enough reservations that night. Our waiter seemed new and a little nervous but he was trying really hard to call all the dishes by the Japanese name. It felt like the restaurant was in a soft opening state but it's been around for a year so it was confusing. We ordered...-Umami Tomato-- 1 star. This is a poached (?) and peeled tomato sitting in a jelly broth made of dashi and passion fruit. Warning, if you don't like passion fruit seeds do not order (high crunch). Also the flavor profile is more sour/fruity than umami.. would've been tastier as a dessert.-Truffle croquette -- 2 stars. Other review photos show really nice white truffle shavings but ours had limp and sad shavings of black truffle... so much so I did not take a photo. -Gindara Yuan (grilled black cod w yuzu soy sauce)-- 4 stars. Tasty but salty so will need to order a side of rice with it. The presentation doesn't look great. -Wagyu ishiyaki (DIY grilling)-- 3 star. Fun to do but the wagyu meat was sort of grey and did not look fresh. -Futomaki-- 3 stars. This thing was thicker than an arm LOL and was basically a sushi burrito cut into 4 pieces. Ate each piece in 3 bites which sort of takes away from all the ingredients inside bc you can't enjoy it at once.  The menu was very long and diverse.. I feel like they'd be better off specializing in a few dishes instead.The inside looked like an older Japanese restaurant.. this might've been intentional.The idea of this place is cool and I wanted to like it but for the price point it disappointed. Having spent more than $200 for 2 people you'd expect better ambience, service or food but everything was subpar."

101,5ZgCfc1_fotAKUp7n3YJkQ,2/24/2023,4 star rating,"Some things were an absolute hit, others were an absolute miss. Had to wait 20 minutes past our reservation time to be seated which was a bit too long for our liking, but the service was great and they made up for it by comping tea and dessert. -Ika Shumai (3/5): good but not my favorite. there were a bit too many textures within the shumai and the skin was a bit dry by the time it got to us. -Wagyu Tataki (5/5): one of my favorites for the night. the wagyu was so tender and melted in mouth and the truffle butter that came with it was to DIE for. would come back for this, melt in your mouth drool worthy combo of flavors -Miso Cod (5/5): so so soft, one of the best cods I have ever had. Literally melts in your mouth and falls apart instantly. Only complaint is that I don't know how well the yuzu paired with it. -Nigiri set (3/5): OK. fish was not extremely extremely as fresh as I would have liked, and not the most soft either -Uni Wagyu Maki (2.5/5): a bit disappointing. the asparagus did NOT pair well with the wagyu and uni AT ALL and the addition of the perilla leaf in the maki made the whole maki taste quite strange and not the most appetizing. We ended up removing the asparagus and perilla leaf to fully enjoy the wagyu and uni (uni was not the most fresh though)-Truffle Donabe (3/5): OK. also a bit disappointing. loved the mushrooms and the burnt rice but the dish was a bit too dry (rice could have had a bit more moisture) and the rice could have been more flavorful too-Hojicha Panna Cotta (1000/5); TO DIE FOR. literally not too sweet, such a heavenly roasted tea flavor, an extremely smooth and refreshing texture. I will dream about this -Teas (5/5): got the matcha yuzu and soba tea. loveddd the soba tea"
102,5ZgCfc1_fotAKUp7n3YJkQ,2/22/2023,4 star rating,"Would recommend this place for the comfort food, but not so much for the sushi.The uni egg custard has great umami flavors, but was a tad too watery for my taste. The grilled eggplant was really good, and the spongy texture also made it kind of fun to eat.The Toro shoyu was my fav of the night - highly recommend! The grilled and marinated fatty tuna was incredibly tender, and the overall taste profile was not heavy-handed but just right. The grilled black cod was also very tender and flavorful. They definitely do their grilled fish very well.The Uni Wagyu Maki was decent, but not as good as I'd expected. The asparagus was a weird element and just didn't work in this roll. We also ordered several pieces of nigiri, of which I was not impressed. While the unagi itself was good, the rice bed fell apart... An indictment of the itamae's artisanal skills. IYKYK."

104,5ZgCfc1_fotAKUp7n3YJkQ,2/4/2023,5 star rating,"Towa is Hand Hospitality's vision for sleek and modern Japanese dining. I think this place flies under the radar in comparison to their other restaurants, but I had a great dining experience here and would highly recommend it! I made a reservation for a party of four on a Saturday evening 6:30pm. I believe they have omakase reservations available at 6pm and 8pm, but unfortunately those were full. The restaurant was pretty empty when I arrived, but filled up pretty quickly by ~8pm. The service here is lovely and attentive, but borders on frivolous. My water was refilled almost immediately every time I took a sip. Impressive I'll admit. Between the four of us, we got all of the cocktails. They were all delicious. The cucumber one was a standout for me after trying them all! One person in our party is gluten intolerant and pescetarian. Our waiter was really helpful in trying to figure out what was okay to order and very accommodating. Their menu offers plenty of dishes, so we truly did not feel limited! We got the following dishes: umami tomato - 4/5: the first bite of this was amazing- it lives up to the umami in this dish's name. by the second bite though, it was overly acidic to me. truly a unique flavor though! uni ikura chawanmushi (steamed egg custard) - 3/5: super smooth and comforting! however smaller and a bit more watery than I expected. gindara yuan (yuzu black cod) - 5/5: lovely smoky and citrus flavor balanced the fish flavor in this dish very nicelynasu dengaku (grilled eggplant with miso) - 5/5: a surprise favorite for me! the presentation of this dish really surprised me-- i've never seen eggplant served like this. i thought the ratio of eggplant to miso for each dish was off, but the flavors and textures were delightful! ebi shinjo (fried shrimp roll) - 5/5: another dish with very well balanced flavors and textures. the fried rice paper surrounding the creamy shrimp filling created the perfect eating experience. majuro special (tuna sashimi, tuna roll) - 4/5: i think we could've skipped this dish. it was definitely good! it just felt like a dish that I could've gotten at any other sushi restaurant and fell flat in comparison to the other dishes. asari and sansai donabe (rice pot with clams and mountain vegetables) - 4/5: the rice texture of this dish is delightful- just a little bit sticky and al dente if you will. I imagine that if I came back and got a donabe with meat it would taste amazing! overall: I had a great experience here and would recommend it! I would love to come back and try their wagyu forward dishes that were recommended to us"
105,5ZgCfc1_fotAKUp7n3YJkQ,2/24/2023,5 star rating,"We came here first time last Aug and came back this Feb. The place looked cozy and the service was attentive. Instead of the omakase, we ordered several dishes on the menu:-Ginadara Yuan (grilled black cod): the fish was tender and well-seasoned- Wagyu Ishiyaki (grilled steak): you grilled the thin-sliced wagyu beef on the hot stone. It smelled so good and melted in your mouth. It came with different sauce and dipping. One of my fav here! - Yaki Gani: It was nice to see that they doubled the portion this Feb in comparison with our visit last Aug. the crab was well cooked and smoky, and the creamy crab miso sauce was just chef kiss!! Another fav fish!- Nigiri set: the fish was fresh but not too special.- Asari and sansai donabe (cooked rice pot with manila clams and veggie): the rice pot was huge and hot. The server would mix and get the rice for you. The rice was well-seasoned. While the other grilled dishes were somewhat small-portioned, this rice dish would def make you full.Overall, the price was a bit steep for the portion (except for the dish) but I still think it's worth it. I would highly recommend!"
106,5ZgCfc1_fotAKUp7n3YJkQ,12/30/2022,5 star rating,"TLDR: Towa is an awesome choice for modern Japanese dining, both an omakase and an elevated izakaya concept in one. Personally - I prefer the tables as opposed to the sushi counter. Don't forget to try the truffle croquette, the prosciutto maki or the yaki gani.We've tried every Hand Hospitality concept at this point, Towa became one of our favorites this year. We've done both a la carte and omakase, we prefer the former.For the omakase, it's a fair price point with some cooked dishes in between the nigiri courses. I would recommend the omakase for someone graduating from the more budget tastings into the mid-tier price range. If you're accustomed to the $200+ sushi-yas, you might be a bit underwhelmed.For me, the a la carte menu is something I find myself craving every couple of weeks. Towa is something like an izakaya that also happens to have omakase in the front. The team is great, especially the GM Natsuki and our favorite server Dana.The menu is broken up into various sections based on the style of dish it is. There are small plates, fried stuff, rice pots, noodles, sushi, etc.For the smaller plates, the truffle croquette is our favorite. A fluffy pillow of potato puree breaded in panko and topped with shaved black truffles. It's the grown up version of all those croquettes you ate when you were younger. It's rich, it's luxurious, it's strangely light on the palette as you eat through it.The wagyu tataki is a good choice too. On our most recent visit, we tried the monkfish tatsuta-age. So unique. Plump seasoned nuggets of monkfish with a very light batter and a squeeze of lemon to balance it out. Very unique.During the winter they also have a winter yellowtail shabu shabu. This truly caught my eye. The dashi broth is brought hot on top of a flame, there are some chrysanthemum greens, julienned carrots and thinly-sliced mushrooms to place in the soup. Sashimi-grade slices of winter yellowtail you can poach quickly in the broth. It's wonderfully fatty, the dashi is piping hot and it's perfect for the cold days lately.The sushi is good and there is a separate a la carte menu for the nigiri. The prices are fair but the nigiri is also on the smaller side. At $10 for a seared wagyu piece though, you can't really complain. The prosciutto maki is both unique and tasty. The outer slice of prosciutto is salty, the capers are briny, the dill and shiso flower lend this freshness of herb with a bit of sweetness from the crab and a creaminess of the avocado. It's a lot going on but it all works well together.Unfortunately my shrimp mazemen is no longer on the menu but the duck soba is excellent. The dashi is flavorful, the noodles are bouncy and the slices of duck are cooked to perfection.Our favorite dish on the menu though is the yaki gani. Period. Pieces of king grab are grilled in the shell and they're served with a side of miso sauce made with the crab innards. The meat is roasty, the sauce is rich and although it is pricey at $42; each bite your mouth will be filled with happiness.Don't leave without getting that hojicha panna cotta. The perfect accompaniment to the complimentary hot tea.PS - If you're into sake, the GM doubles as a sake somm."
107,5ZgCfc1_fotAKUp7n3YJkQ,11/30/2022,5 star rating,"Fresh seafood, delicate flavors, and an extensive menu highlighting quality ingredients are just some of the reasons why I'm still dreaming about my dinner at this Kaiseki style restaurant. I loved the minimal decor, our sweet and helpful server, but most of all it was the food driving me to pen this five star review.I'll start with the best dish of the night-- the otoro. Fatty tuna is always a fan favorite among seafood lovers, but theirs is extra flavorful because it's soy-marinated and lightly grilled. The meat was so tender and the grated daikon and pieces of soy marinated potato added textural interest and more flavor. A dash of yuzu for light citrus flavor, a bit of chili for a subtle kick, and a sprinkle of chives gave it a nice aromatic flavor. Honestly this dish was perfect.Moving onto the Sakizuke course, I have to shout out the Kanpachi carpaccio. Slices of the freshest kanpachi I have ever had the pleasure of dining on were topped with diced Asian pear, sliced radish, ponzu, dill, and aromatic extra virgin olive oil. Like the otoro, this dish was fatty but the citrus flavor gave it some zest and made it feel like a lighter dish.I wondered what could warrant the $25 for a sushi roll until the work of art that was the Futo Maki came out. I love the slice of okra in the center that looks like a star, surrounded by tamago, cucumber, kanpachi, shrimp, tuna, salmon, and kanpyo. The different colors made it feel like a piece of jewelry but in food form. Each sushi piece was enormous, filling, and full of flavor. The only dish I ordered that I wasn't too keen on was the tako soba. The slices of octopus were fresh, but as much as I appreciate subtle flavors in Japanese cooking, the sauce was a bit too subdued for my liking. I didn't find myself reaching for this dish on the table.Towa is a beautiful ode to kaiseki Japanese cooking, and is where I had one of my most memorable meals of the year, as I reflect on some of my favorites. The team behind Atomix and Her Name Is Han has proven to be restaurant virtuosos, and I will follow them to every single NYC restaurant they continue to open."

My heart says sweet but my brain usually wants something savory to make it feel like an actual meal. At Crepes on Columbus, I was able to resolve this age old predicament by ordering *the most divine and fragrant French Onion Soup* I have had in my life as the savory counterpart to my strawberry/banana nutella crepe. Really decent prices, this place feels like an authentic spot for a French lunch. Not a gimmicky crepe spot that spends more on decor than the food preparation. Portion size is excellent and the crepe itself was delectably thin but sturdy and soaked up the whipped cream and nutella very nicely. Servers were prompt and friendly. A quiet spot, but maybe that's because I went at 3PM on a Sunday. My boyfriend really enjoyed his caramel apple crepe, only said the creme fraiche was strictly creme."

You get to choose the base (can mix, I got rice and mixed greens), the protein, up to 3 sauces and unlimited choices of vegetables and toppings. I recommend getting no more than 3 sauces as it can be too much, don't make the same mistake I made. As for the avocado shake, I felt like it was a bit pricey.

My go-to order is two protein (ahi tuna + salmon) on sushi rice, along with a ton of toppings. Some favorites are edamame, garlic crisps, seaweed salad, mango, and more. It's amazing that you get an unlimited choice of toppings because so many other poké spots limit or charge extra. They give a generous amount and their service is pretty quick as well. They even give you a stamp card if you'd like. My family and I have started getting bowls about once a week here. Their drinks such as their bubble tea and smoothies are also very good. A bit pricey, but it always hit the spot if you're craving. Overall, highly recommend if you're looking for a quality poké bowl on staten island."

I came in and asked what was the point of doing that? If I didn't pay any mind I would've paid for it with no refund. When I approached the register I pointed out how the situation made no sense and instead of apologizing (like I would've) they each had an attitude and their solution wanted tried to give me a refund. I said no I want a sandwich which I got. The store manager needs to speak to employees over their attitudes. This happened around 2 pm and the employee by the refrigerator was very nice just not the other employees. I hope this fixes the issue in the future. I'm sure customers want friendly employees."

178,YFwncruQm44GTqn2jZ9BwQ,3/9/2023,5 star rating,"Budget friendly and perfect to split. It's fresh and sweet where you want it to be (mango chunks were bursting with summer sweetness) but overall the dessert itself is not overly sweet or filling. Even if you're 8/10 full after a big dinner, splitting the cup for 2 people was extremely doable. The mango-themed menu is giving Hui Lau Shan vibes, if you've ever head of the famous dessert franchise from Taiwan.= Special Mango Juice Sago & Pomelo (5/5) =Light, satisfying, and refreshing. The citrusy sour pomelo pieces cut nicely through sherbet-y mango ice cream. The mango puree moat is similar texture to red bean soup and it's much lighter than say, your average smoothie - but no heavy denseness. Sago beads are like tiny flavorless jello pearls, unlike boba that is chewy/sweet. Sago adds a nice texture and you really don't notice it much. This was perfect for us because I wasn't down for a heavy mille or cheesecake, or even a sundae because they seemed so filling for just two people. Service was fast. Restaurant is tiny. Tipped extra because the 1 girl who was balancing the entire restaurant on her shoulders was doing a great job despite tables and seats being fully maxed out. Bring cash!"

The ambiance was really chill, just people talking amongst themselves at the little tables and sharing desserts. The service was also really quick and after I got my food, they let me sit there and do work on my laptop for about 1.5 hours which I appreciated.I got the mango mochi which was $5.75 for three pieces (with tax, it was $6.25). This was a tad more expensive than I would have wanted because they weren't very large (hence the 4 stars), but the mochi was fresh + delicious and there was an actual piece of fresh mango in the middle which made it even more tasty. The mochi was warm and soft and not too sweet :)Would definitely come here again and try other things on the menu! Heads up, the space is fairly narrow and small so if you have a large group, I would suggest doing takeout, but if you're coming with 1-2 other people, then by all means stop by and sit down!Another heads up, if you want to pay with card, you have to purchase at least $10 worth of food. Otherwise, bring cash!"
180,YFwncruQm44GTqn2jZ9BwQ,3/2/2023,3 star rating,Stop by this dessert place since my nephew enjoyed it last time he came.  The mango smoothie was decent and the vanilla strawberry Sunday was alright.  Basic vanilla ice cream top with whip cream and chocolate. nothing too special with that dessert.  They have other dessert options as well that seems decent.  They do not have a restroom here for diners.  place is very small and tight about 3 small tables.

I think the biggest table can fit maybe 4 people. So, I ordered two items to go. Mango Mochi and Mango Pancake. They are both very good with fresh mangos. If I have to chose between the two, I prefer Mango Mochi more. The texture is so soft and perfect amount of sweetness.  The shredded coconut gives a suble flavor. The Mango Pancake is a soft light egg flavoured crepes stuffed with fresh mango and whipped cream. It was over stuffed in my opinion and better to consume at the restaurant. It can get very sloppy when you try to eat this on the go. They also have wide range of classic Hong Kong style desserts and cakes. Hot and cold options and drinks.  Leave room in your stomach if you plan to come here for dessert."
183,YFwncruQm44GTqn2jZ9BwQ,2/13/2023,4 star rating,"It was very cold when I came in but warmed up pretty quickly when I got inside. I ordered and it came out fairly quickly, around 5 minutes. The ice cream was mango-y and very creamy. The mango juice was more like a purée which I really liked as I was able to cover the rest of the dish in it with every scoop. The mangos were fresh and the rice balls were soft yet still very chewy. That gave the dish with so many different textures and tastes that you can change it up with every spoonful. My only complaint is that it's relatively small, as I was able to finish it alone after eating a meal. But overall, very refreshing and satisfied my sweets craving."

The Special Mango Sago with Pomelo was light and refreshing (though some mango pieces were a tad bitter near the peel). Not pictured, but we also got the Mango Pancake which was so delicious. The mango was super sweet, and the cream was perfectly light. I would definitely get the pancake again."

Came here for brunch on a Sunday with two others. We had a reservation for 11:30am and the place was pretty empty. By the time we left the place was fairly packed.I ordered a Cafe Latte which was alright. We got an order of the French Toast to share, which was my favorite thing of the entire meal. Not because it was exceptionally good, it was just the best thing we ate. My boyfriend ordered the French Onion Soup, which was pretty disappointing. The broth was sour which is an interesting take on french onion soup. For myself, I ordered the Truffle Omelette, which was just okay. The truffle flavor was very faint, the salad that accompanied the omelette was not very appetizing either, and I felt like I got a half portion of the potatoes it came with.Overall, everyone in my party agreed that the meal was subpar. Thank you, next!"

The croissant thing they give you instead of regular bread is a nice touch. Omelette didn't have much flavor, the fruit was good, fries were good, but my friend didn't like her penna alla vodka. She did like her cocktail, though I can't recall which one she got. Service was quick."
191,Gc7OVEIs4HodL4hw9U3C3w,5/1/2022,4 star rating,"Although Copinette is labeled as a French/American restaurant, a lot of its menu is actually comprised of tasty Italian pasta options. To start, we got the Fried Calamari, which were nice and soft- the softness was good in a way, but  it was also missing a bit of the crispy fried exterior. I also ordered the Mushroom Veal Bolognese. This pasta was supposed to be fettuccine, but it was actually more like spaghetti. Nevertheless, it was still tasty, as it was cooked to a nice chewy consistency with little chunks of veal/lamb in it. It wasn't particularly flavorful, but was still enjoyable. To drink, I got the Copinette Cosmo, which was a bit strong with the vodka in comparison to the fruity cranberry flavor, but good nonetheless. The prices ($24 for the pasta, $17 for the calamari, and $16 for the cocktail) were in line with other restaurants of this quality.The interior of the restaurant has a classy vibe with some trendy artwork. There is lots of seating both inside and outside. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the service speed was pretty quick.Overall, Copinette has a variety of high quality French, American, and Italian foods served in a classy environment."

193,Gc7OVEIs4HodL4hw9U3C3w,2/6/2022,5 star rating,"Wow I was completely blown away by my Restaurant Week dining experience here! When I was browsing menus, Copinette's definitely stood out to me and sounded so enticing, and their $39 dinner deal was relatively more affordable than $59 dinner deals at other places - music to my med-student-wallet's ears :)My friend and I made a reservation at 5 pm just in case, but the restaurant was relatively empty that Saturday evening and we were seated very quickly. I really loved the decor and ambience of the place - it somehow gave off cozy yet aesthetically modern and sleek vibes at the same time. Our servers were incredibly attentive about water and offering us butter & bread, which was so hearty and warm and much appreciated after we crossed 4 avenues in 20 degree weather to get to the restaurant!For the appetizer, I got the crispy tortellini while my friend got the French onion soup. I wasn't sure what I was expecting, since the tortellini I received wasn't exactly crispy, but there seemed to be another bread crumb coating outside the pasta skin. The filling inside was delicious and bursting with flavor! For the entree, my friend and I both got the pan seared pork chop dish and we were both amazed at the portion size. This was my first time trying a stuffed pork chop and it was incredible! The meat was so tender and juicy, despite the size of the cut - I'm so impressed at how well they were able to cook it! I had been a little anxious because I don't like blue cheese and the dish was served with blue cheese fingerling potatoes and green beans, but I enjoyed the sides immensely! The blue cheese flavor wasn't overpowering at all and everything on the plate just seemed to pair so well together. Needless to say, I definitely wasn't able to finish my entree and had to take part of it to go.For the dessert, we both got the peach melba (caramelized peaches, vanilla ice cream, raspberry puree and whipped cream), which honestly was what I was most excited to try. Even though I didn't really get a lot of raspberry puree in my glass, the dessert was so rich and indulgent and I can honestly say, this was one of my favorite meals I've ever had. My pictures definitely don't do justice to their taste and quality :) We never had to wait very long for our dishes, and I'm so glad I was able to check out this restaurant! I can't wait to come back on a special occasion and try other items on their menu!"

Good taste, good amount of punch and took us all to that happy place after our drink!For Appetizers, we got the Truffle Burrata ($16) and Super Lump Crab Cake ($19) both of which were excellent and very flavorful.For mains we got the Smoked Salmon Frittata ($18), Four Cheese Ravioli ($20), Truffle Risotto ($19), and Fettuccine Bolognese ($22). The vegetarian options were excellent and my Four Cheese Ravioli was very delicious. Our table enjoyed their meal and food overall was really delicious and for a change, really well priced too!Service was excellent, friendly staff, and food arrived within 20 minutes of ordering.

The food is good and the prices are reasonable for good quality ingredients without breaking the bank. The place is dimly lit and the shadows cast a romantic vibe throughout the space. The service was excellent. We were welcomed with a lot of warmth and enthusiasm. We ordered a bottle of Ruffino Prosecco and the bottle was perfectly chilled. We ordered the fried beef tortellini, crispy calamari with marinara sauce, Amish chicken breast, four cheese ravioli, and dessert. Everything was very tasty. The four cheese ravioli is very saucy for those that love to sauce it up. I'm personally not a fan but  it still tasted good."

I would say it's right on par with any other chicken and waffle spot! it was really good I enjoyed every bite & lick! they give you a special strawberry sauce to put on your waffles ugh so good! i'll definitely be back.DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS SPOT"

Later the one at the counter was clearly not doing anything but walking around with a visible face of discomfort like she did not want to be there. The food took very long to come out and when it did it was cold. The server sat us and we placed our drink order. Never came to check on us until the food was served. You can see people coming to sit down and at one point all tables were full. Minutes later the server asked for our order and The restaurant was  out of pretty much anything in the menu except for chicken, waffles, bacon or grits. Everyone else keeps getting their drinks, except for my table. Eventually the food comes out, still no drinks. Halfway through our meal we had to go up to ask for the drinks one by one because the server did not get the hint after two people on my party of six went to ask for drinks. The server explained she was the only one working... but I was still confused as to what that other lady was doing if she was at th establishment? Oh boy them grits and waffles were a disaster! The waffle was soft and cold... and the grits runny and watery. I asked for cheese on my grits and they literally slapped a slice of Krafts singles on top. They didn't even wait for it to melt or mix it. Just save your money or go somewhere else!"

They had a grand opening about 2 weeks ago. Tried it out today for lunch. Seems like a lot of ppl are excited as well, I saw a lot of deliveries being picked up. They have indoor and outdoor seating. Cash and card accepted. No liquor but tons of lemonade options, coffee and tea. We ordered the following:-Bacon waffle with shrimp $17+-Strawberry waffle with chicken $15+-Passion fruit lemonade $3-Strawberry Lemonade $3The waffles were excellent, would definitely come back for them. I enjoyed the bacon, it was mixed within the waffle.  The Strawberry waffles has like a Strawberry filling/jam that you could put on top of your waffle.  The shrimp was seasoned nicely but they were kind of small and fried hard. I added a piece of chicken thigh for $1.50! Not bad. Took home half the waffle and the chicken to finish later. They do have another location on nostrand which has a wider variety of offerings. For my next visit I'd like to try their waffle sandwich or the reggae pasta. Happy to have more variety in the neighborhood. Check out @ifancyny on Instagram for more"

Food was cold when served after a long wait of over an hour and chicken very salty ( couldn't even eat). They have got to do better.
237,lmcVbZaSfTtGdjRN5ejZiw,9/24/2021,4 star rating,"Ordered takeout from here and it was delicious! I got the chicken and cherry waffle and it was fabulous! The waffle was full of cherries. The batter on the chicken was crispy and flavorful, although a little salty for my liking. I would LOVE it if there was a spicy chicken option so I don't have to add hot sauce making my batter wet eventually. I think a clearer explanation of the dishes online would be helpful. The combo I ordered came with THREE huge pieces of chicken that I wasn't expecting so I had also ordered a side leg and I actually got two pieces with that. I had 5 pieces of chicken for 1 person! LoL. No problem. Food never goes to waste in my house! Boyfriend came home later and devoured the leftovers. Oh! I also ordered the passion fruit lemonade! It was so damn good! Looking forward to ordering from here again!"

As other yelpers suggested, portion size is a bit small, so it was a smart move that I ordered Bahn Mi on top of Pho. The pho did not look special by look, but tasted delicious, probably one of the top 5 places I tried in NY. Bahn Mi was crispy and delicious as well. For the price, I think I really enjoyed the meal! I will definitely order from here next time. Check this place out whenever you crave either pho or Bahn Mi!"

When I asked the cashier about it, she said that the prices online haven't been updated in a while, and there's a 5% fee to use a credit card. I understanding rising prices and credit card fees, but I do not understand not updating menu prices so you can have an accurate receipt total.

This one however is small and low key and doesn't. Also in 2020 you just order outside and wait outside. They've set up picnic tables out on the sidewalk, which on Lincoln Pl is a nice quiet space to eat unlike some of the busier areas of the city.The food is delicious and comes fast. I ordered and then waited no more than 5 minutes on a Thursday afternoon. And the tofu was fresh, the mayo was heavy (a bit too heavy for me) and the greens were crisp and punchy. It's all about those pickled julienned carrots and radish for me and they give a good serving. Now if I could only fit a bite in my mouth of all the ingredients. But this is just a general banh mi problem I think."

Thankfully my experience was far from negative.First impression, love the vibe.I came here randomly after two doctors appointments. I needed to eat some good food and wooosa. It was about 12:30ish and this place had a nice crowd inside.The Smith and the restaurant to the left seem to blend into eachother, same color on the outside of the building. It was a little difficult to distinguish which was which but just look for the clear glass window on the door with The Smith logo.The hostest greeted me as soon as I entered. I was immediately taken to a seat. Some of the tables towards the front feel a little awkward but i was thankful to be seated more into the center of the restaurant. I was close to the bar. This restaurant has a beautiful bar with seating, there's table tops, regular tables and booths. I sat at a small round table. I ordered The Gatsby drink. Actually love it. You can def taste the gin but the sparkling wine def stands out. The Pomegranate, hibiscus and lemon flavor is very very light but its there and delish.For a starter i wanted to try something different and got the Roasted Tomato soup. It was the absolute most amazing thing ever. I am so glad i took a risk and ordered it. I cant wait to return and have this soup again. I also ended up getting the Smith Bar Steak with salad and chimichurri sauce. The steak was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The chimichurri sauce had big chopped pieces of fresh herbed which I loved. I got the green salad with it and it was dressed with balsamic vinaigrette, really good. I pushed myself and got dessert. I was already beyond full BUT my waiter is the best at making the food sound so amazing when he explains what they have. haha. He was the best. I got the sticky toffee pudding. Omg omg omg. I didnt expect that. It was so delicious, soft, sticky and warm. They put a scoop of ice cream on top as well. The entire thing was just soooo good. It was my first time trying it but surely wont be last. I really enjoyed my time here. Its rare that i visit a restaurant and write a review next day...however  this place deserves it. My waiter, Nikolai was the sweetest. He was super knowledgeable on the menu and made really good suggestions. I hope that i get to have him as a waiter again.The bathrooms are unique. Love the photo booth down stairs. I also love the fact that all stalls are gender neutral and the sinks are outside. It gives the restrooms such a modern feel. Its quite nice to look at. Again, this place is a must visit."

We were asked if we were ready to order every 3 minutes and then kinda rushed to go when one of us was still eating so I took a point off for that. The bathroom is super clean with many stalls and then a shared sink area for all genders. There's also a photobooth downstairs where the bathroom is by. I ordered the Squid Ink Tagliatelle, which had shrimp in it. It was absolutely delicious. We also had fries for the table but it wasn't anything special, go get ur fix at McDonalds for cheaper!"

The interior of the restaurant is gives upscale and modern diner energy. The food was really good and pretty decent portion sizes.

The Calamari was a slight disappointment; the seasoning wasn't particularly noticeable and the skin was kind of soggy. The burger that I got was a pretty standard burger; nothing overtly special or terrible about it. The restaurant had nice aesthetics, though the service was a little bit slow during the dinner rush. For the price and quality of food, there are definitely better options in the area."
253,k5NAz3-goMXKoUqPfOZ1Hw,2/21/2023,3 star rating,"Casual American Brasserie with multiple locations across New York City, tried the one in Midtown East. Popular brunch spot, however not completely worth the hype. For a sweet dish, we ordered the Vanilla Bean French Toast, dusted with powdered sugar and served with caramelized bananas, which seemed to ruin the dish for us. To help balance it out, as a savory dish we ordered the Steak & Eggs and opted for the ribeye steak. This was bone in, served with mixed greens, hash, and sunny side eggs. The hash was flavorful however the steak was basic and nothing differentiate the steak from other brunch spots. Food looked better than it actually tasted. Definitely should reserve in advance as the restaurant has tendencies to be booked."
254,k5NAz3-goMXKoUqPfOZ1Hw,8/28/2022,4 star rating,"The Smith is a New York classic. I've been to various locations, and the restaurant quality is consistent.The Kale & Quinoa salad is my go-too order, and it never disappoints. I recommend adding chicken or shrimp!The roasted cauliflower appetizer was delicious, and the spicy tuna tartare was an insanely flavorful. My dining companion did not love the vegetable bibimap. It is served in a scorching hot mortar bowl, and it took a long time to cook off! The bowl continued to sear the rice throughout the meal, making it almost too crunchy. However, I'd you're vegetarian, you may enough the dish.Overall, The Smith is a pillar of mid-tier NY dining that continues to perform. The burger is a fan favorite, so I recommend giving it a try."

We had the whole private room space downstairs and it was great.  The service was on point as was the food. They let us come in early to set up and decorate. We looked into dozens of places to have my shower and the smith was the best bang for our buck for sure! I would highly recommend having a party here. They were very great to work with. And you know you won't be disappointed in the food! We had everything family style and it was a ton of food!!!! Everything was so delicious. For reference we were around 30-35 people.

Salmon tartare was nasty (salmon wasn't fresh and smelled). The burger was dry. I ordered medium rare and the inside was indeed pink, but the meat was dry and tasteless. The WORST burger I've EVER had. McDonald's should get a Michelin star compared to that. Good thing I ordered a side of salad which was good."

259,5QfE9v_IfCgAezqnHNzHWg,7/19/2021,3 star rating,So me and a few of my co worker's came to this spot for our lunch break and I'm so glad we did. First of all the ambience and decor is definitely my vibe and so chill and laid back. They played a great selection of music pop/hip hop kind mixed with r&b and they have a nice tv area where you can watch while eating.  I was unsure what to order but I decided to go with the falafel sandwich. Sizing is amazing you can eat half now and the other half later. The staff was decent there is a gentlemen not Filipino idk his race but he was rude and kinda stand offish they could have been a bit nicer lol which is why I didn't give them 5 stars. ( CUSTOMER SERVICE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME). Overall nice experience. I would return again to work on my business or just to come and chill in a nice lowkey spot in bushwick. Pricing is expensive.  My sandwich was 15$ I believe and with tax like $16.75.  This also came with tortilla chips and a sauce
260,5QfE9v_IfCgAezqnHNzHWg,8/9/2022,1 star rating,Very rude staff. There was only one man working there snd he was not friendly. Did not attend to me for well over 6 minutes when i was the only one standing by the register. I asked for a drink without ice because I am sensitive to cold drinks but he said he would have to charge me double because I would be getting double the drink without ice. I said just pour the normal amount you would give with one serving but leave out the ice... i do this a lot and i always expect less in my cup (compared to the orders with ice) so i'm used to it. But he said no. He said he could only do it the regular way so I just left instead. It's really disheartening because I just moved to the area and this place looks great and had lots of drinks that I was excited to come back and try out. But now after that negative experience I'd rather not spend any money there.

If you want to sit inside you have to get your temperature checked and fill out a form (or maybe just sign)? I opted to sit outside. I ordered the tuna sandwich which was great! Crispy toast and tuna was good with a surprise crunch of cucumber. The side of chips that comes with it is also really good! Not sure exactly what they were but they were crunchy and seasoned well! I first ordered lagunitas on tap then a Stella on tap. Both tasted odd to me. Will probably just order a beer in a can or bottle next time! Nice spot on Broadway, worth another try sometime."

Fortunately, you can walk a block in this area without passing some kind of taco vendor. So, I walked a few steps and ended up here. We walked past the small, open kitchen to a seating area and were promptly given menus and chips and salsa. They've got all the usual suspects - tacos, cemitas, tortas, flautas. I ordered chips and guac, expecting to be disappointed but hoping for the best. So many times, I've ordered guac and instead received a bowl of green liquid. I was pleasantly surprised when it came out -- you could tell it was actually made of avocado. It needed a bit of salt, but otherwise it was well seasoned and lacked sad filler tomatoes. Next came the tamale - we opted for jalapeño and cheese. It was a good size and well made but spicy spicy! And then I went on down to taco town. I ordered a basic bistec, my favorite lengua, and the oreja as a wildcard. The bistec was good but average. The lengua was the true stunner. I'm a lengua lover - beefy flavor, buttery texture - and this was on point. Unfortunately, my oreja was inedible. I've had great oreja from a truck so I thought a place with a real kitchen could do even better. Unfortunately, the texture was awful and rubbery. If I'm in the area and craving guac and lengua, I'll stop in but I don't think this will be on my regular rotation."

I tried it on a whim just because I was getting tired of my other Mexican spot up the next block. The food is always great! Authentic for sure! I like that they have a dining area in the back. There's one young waitress that's always there and this girl manages every table on her own, very well. And for the non-Spanish speaking peeps (Hipsters), shes bilingual. The Bistec a la Mexicana is my favorite. Huge portions. Fresh corn tortillas. The salsa verde is baller. And, the most important, the rice and refried beans are on point!! Although very good, they could use a tad more flavor BUT the consistency of both are what I'm judging. Well cooked Mexican rice and refried beans are hard to find. Black beans dominate this area for sure. Tamales on the weekends are the shit, sweet and savory. And if you want beer, they have it, in bottles, and a decent Imported selection. Theres also a spot to the left of Cholula that has great pan dulce, especially when its fresh outta the oven. Go to Cholula. Work your way through the whole menu. Shit is just good!!"

280,M8xnlKQOh0tl58LJCnPUVA,3/12/2023,5 star rating,"I thought I had already reviewed Ravagh since I went back in the fall time, but it was amazing. Granted, I went with close Persian friends who knew exactly what to order for the table. I was blown away by almost every dish we were served - just the bread alone is reason enough for me to return. Let's start with our apps - the Kashk-Bademjan or as I'd call it - the mashed eggplant dish. It was very new to me. It's mashed roast eggplant with hints of a nutty and herb-y taste - pairs quite well with bread (think of it like pita and hummus). The next one was actually not that special - it's the Shirazi salad (spot-on similar to pico de gallo except with the addition of cucumbers). Onto the entrees, we got the beef Koobideh, the jujeh kabob and the juicy dark meat chicken kabob. The beef and spicy dark meat chicken entrees were so good I almost gave a standing ovation. The marinade was something that cannot be replicated at home and the juiciness sailed beyond expectations. I do want to note that the ""spicy"" dark meat chicken was really not at all spicy but as you can tell, I still love it. The jujeh, however, was charred and dry. My Persian friends told me that jujeh (also commonly spelled as joojeh) was basically their country's version of rotisserie chicken so I was thinking that the jujeh was going to be like ""akbar joojeh"" but nope, it wasn't along those lines. Service was slow and there was miscommunication with our server (who was actually Mexican but he spoke an understandable amount of English and it led to a fee added onto our bill three times) but I would still 100% return."

285,M8xnlKQOh0tl58LJCnPUVA,3/15/2023,5 star rating,Luscious Persian restaurant with masterfully cooked meat (can't go wrong with any of them) + bread that comes in modest portions (albeit with too much of an emphasis on white rice and without the outstanding side condiments you would expect). $22 a dish. 4.75/5 stars as a dinner spot.

For appetizers we got the kotlet (beef and potato patty), and entrees we ordered the chicken Shish kebab and dark meat chicken kebab, and a side of fries. The portions were huge, and can be shared between 2-3 depending on how much you eat. The servers always check up on you and are very kind. We also ordered the chocolate mousse cake for my best friends birthday and it was delish!"

289,GVF4kvXupD18afjpLiPLHA,3/2/2023,2 star rating,Was with a friend last week and still can't believe how disappointing the food was.   If the food is better for dinner they should not open for lunch. There was a cocktail menu so we decided to try expresso martinis.  The cocktail tasted like instant powdered expresso was used.  We decided a bottle of wine would be better.  The menu is extremely limited and no traditional  entrees with tomato sauce.   If you only enjoy Northern Italian then you might find something .  When you say you're taking someone for Italian food there should be at least one parmigiana and a pasta with a plain or meat sauce.  No sauce on menu or specials. The backed clams were flat tasting and breadcrumbs were more like a batter.  Calamari was rubbery tasted baked not fried! Our server was very nice and accommodating.  The ambiance wad to be expected.I definitely would not return.

292,GVF4kvXupD18afjpLiPLHA,2/27/2022,2 star rating,"This is based on takeout I got from Marco Polo. I've never eaten in the restaurant. I've walked past them dozens of times and have always been curious, so when an Italian craving hit, my bf and I decided to try them out. Delivery came quick and our mains arrived warm. Unfortunately nothing was very good. We ordered the caesar salad, penne vodka, and chicken parm. It also came with several slices of bread. The bread was SUPER STALE. At least a day old. I'm surprised they deemed that acceptable to serve.  The caesar was ok, but we were not a fan of the powdered parmesan or the thick dressing with a heavy anchovy flavor. The cheese on the chicken parm tasted store bought. The pastas were edible.I really believe that you get what you pay for. Just a couple nights prior we went to another Italian restaurant, had a phenomenal meal, and paid the exact same price as we did for this takeout. Same amount of food. We are willing to pay for quality. If Marco Polo charged 1/2 the price, or even 2/3 the price, then my expectations would have been been lowered and the quality would have made sense. But something just isn't adding up here."

Our party of four were taken aback with the very reasonable menu pricing, especially during this period of the escalating cost of dining out. At an adjacent table were a group of well-dressed Italian-speaking diners. We asked our waiter who they were and he said they came in front Manhattan and were referred by the Italian Consulate. That's a pretty good endorsement! If you want something less formal, go Enoteca on Court next door, the sister operation."

About ten years ago, it changed owners, chefs, and decor. It became pedestrian, loud, and ""trendy"". We stopped going and found other restaurants to go to. Last week we needed a restaurant close by, so decided to try Marco Polo again. IT WAS DEVINE! The recipes were back to the good food from 30 years ago, the waters were attentive and drinks and food were served in a timely manner with charming wait staff. The noise level had decreased so it had become again, the comfortable dining experience that a fine restaurant should be. We were very pleased, and went back to make sure that it was not a fluke. It wasn't. From salad to dessert, the food was excellent. May we urge you to try Marco Polo again. You won't be disappointed."

Especially of their wonton eggdrop soup, chicken curry, and General Tso's. Delivery has occurred as quickly as under 15 minutes! No delivery charge.Ordering is very efficient.Once, my wallet disappeared right after I placed an order. They were so fast that they appeared before I could finish searching for it. They kindly let me have the food and allowed me to pay them later (which I did of course!). In another instance, they accidentally delivered the wrong item.

I considered leaving but decided to wait for my order since I had already paid. The woman at the counter was very rude. Then she came out to the tiny dining area to talk very loudly on her cell phone for an extended conversation.

They will not correct the mistake but they'll will yell at you and hang up on you. i.e ""That's not what you ordered not our problem!!!"" With the accent of course. It's better to go in person which defeats the purpose sometimes when you just want to order in. You could ask them to repeat your order when on the phone but they'll just hang up on you mid sentence. There's a Chinese spot on every corner, food isn't that great to experience their lack of customer service."

No pork, it's all veggies and delicious. The other places in the neighborhood make it really oily and greasy with pork. 3 stars only because I never order anything else except the hot and sour soup so I don't know anything about what others say about this place. Sometimes they aren't the most cordial people but if you're only there for a large hot and sour soup you are in and out fairly quickly so it doesn't matter."

Don't expect much in terms of service or ambience, but get ready for the amazing breads and pastries. Some of my favorites are the sesame ball with red bean paste, barbecue pork bun, and lemon raisin twists. Be prepared with cash since they don't take credit card!"
312,SiM5G8LqVW9XQaPLbFkD7Q,2/11/2023,5 star rating,This is the most consistently good Chinese style bakery around in Flushing. They have a very wide selection so it's a one stop place where they have so much to choose and they rarely run out of you fav items unless you go late in the day. My wife always picks up a couple of bag full of stuff from here every time she is in Flushing.   We grab stuff from their Chinatown location as well when we are there.
313,SiM5G8LqVW9XQaPLbFkD7Q,3/26/2022,4 star rating,"This used to be my go to Chinese bakery every time I passed through Chinatown.  For the Flushing location, I'd make the trek even if it wasn't on the way, just to stop in!  It's been a while since I've come back but recently I made my way once again.They have all the same staples: classics like pineapple buns, hot dog buns, egg tarts, cakes, etc.  Over time, I will say that not everything tastes the same as it used to.  This used to be my favorite spot for egg tarts since their crusts were especially flaky but I haven't tried it recently so I can't speak to the current quality.When I came this time, I got the following: milk tea with sugar, coconut cream bun (my grandpa likes these), two curry beef triangles, and pineapple bun/bread.  My grandpa has been trying the coconut cream buns from several places and his initial observation was that there wasn't as much cream in this one compared to Fay Da's.  The curry beef triangles were still as flaky as I remembered and I like these slightly better than Fay Da's personally for that reason.  Pineapple bread is a classic bakery bread and usually pretty good from most bakeries.  However, this was a bit of a let down for me because while it tasted fine, the crumbly part on top felt a bit dry and hard (and I didn't wait too long to eat it so that usually isn't the case).  This was a bit surprising to me so I wasn't sure if the quality had changed since I'd last gone or if it was just the batch that day.That definitely won't deter me from coming back to Taipan Bakery though I'd definitely need to retry the egg tart and other favorites to see if the quality has held up.  The curry beef triangles (ga li jiao) are still my favorite so I'm happy about that!  Definitely come by and try out their baked goods if you're in the area!"

Sure in Queens, there's plenty of Chinese bakeries to choose from but Tai Pan has remained my favorite over the years for their low prices, fresh and consistent food quality, and fast service. I also love to stop by for drinks. For non Chinese speakers- don't be off put by what may seem like brusque service (it's their way of being efficient and courteous, so don't take it personally)"

But the crowd can be hit-or-miss. I'm all for dive bars and the clientele they attract but... well, 90% of the people I've met here have been great. The staff is awesome... but bars like this seem to draw in a bunch of try-hards. You know the type...This bar is fun if you go with a group but it's not really a ""dive bar"" in the traditional sense. Feels like a regular bar role-playing as a dive bar.

The bartenders are always super chill and nice, the price is right on the drinks. Tons of beer and shot specials (my favorite is Coors and Whiskey) and there is food every so often for free. Last night they had Williamsburg Pizza which is a clutch a move because pizza is out of this world. Backyard area is great too, well though out and just a beautiful space for sitting outside and enjoying a beer. It can get a bit smokey, but smokers have been fully banished throughout the city to hey, they need a place too. Only minor complaint is sometimes inside the music can be insanely loud, like hurt your ears loud. But that's really dependent on the bartender who tending. So is the mix of tunes - I've heard 80s hairbands to Johnny Cash, so really runs the gambit. I hope Lady Jay's stays in the hood as long as possible, but I fear development encroaching.

The average craft beer here is $5-7, which considering how close this place is to the Williamsburg thoroughfare, is pretty decent.2) The patio out back is big, especially for a bar this cozy. Bonus points for the comfortable wooden garden chairs, and the tables that are equally suitable for storing your beer or kicking back your feet.3) The bartenders here are nice, down-to-earth, and attentive. That's not always the case unfortunately!So for these three reasons and more, Lady Jay's will be one of my standbys for my recommended Williamsburg bar crawl."

The menu contains so many different options that anyone can spend a year ordering from this place and always be pleasantly surprised. If I were to criticize one thing from here, it would be their patacon, but it's just my preference. The platano slices are way too big and thick that they overpower the dish. What I did was remove one piece of platano and eat the ""sandwich"" like that. However, everything else tasted amazing! Their yuca poutin has so many flavors. It was an explosion in your mouth. The crunchy arepa is very different from the Colombian one since the Argentine one is less thick. I love both but it's nice to get different interpretations of the same dish. The platano Maduro dishes were good but...again my preference...I would've preferred the platanos to be more ripe. However, I know how difficult that could be with consistency in a restaurant. The pepito sandwich was also interesting. Although I would say the description is inaccurate...it no way resembles a panini...the bread makes the sandwich. It was so soft and sort of sweet that it added a whole different flavor profile. Oh and the quesillo flan was also something new and I will try to add rum to my flan the next time I make it. The rum adds a different mild after taste that heightens the dish. Overall, whatever you order from here will be prepared very well and it even travels well-if you do not wish to eat in the restaurant"

There are some questionable stickers on the doorpost for young children who can read (avert their eyes or be ready to have some conversations). Service was gracious - you can order ahead of time and will be notified when it's ready. The food is solid. We had:Chicken empanadas - three to an order and freshly fried cornmeal shell, stuffed with juicy, shredded chicken and a bit of potato. Yucca fries (plain but the loaded ones looked good) - delicious when freshly fried.Pulled pork rice bowl - served with the juiciest and perfectly seasoned pulled pork, white rice and a mountain of black beans with shredded quest blanco on top. The portions are huge!A vegetarian patacon - loved the addition of the sweet plantain and the avocado working together. With the black beans and cheese. These are customizable- next time we'll add the sour pickle for a few cents - it could have used some vinegar to cut the richness of the other ingredients.Highly recommend this establishment for a tasty and quick Venezuelan meal."

I got a paisa patacon, vegetarian tacucho, and fresh passion fruit juice. All the food was pretty solid, but it didn't knock me off my feet (I had somewhat high expectations). I get a feeling it would've been better if I had the food when it was hot rather than having it wait through delivery.Paisa Patacon 3.7/5Lots of good here and this was the thing I really wanted to love. There was such a variety of flavors and textures which was good at some bites and odd at other bites! The sauce of this sandwich spilled a bit in the delivery bag. Overall, it was a great choice. Some of the meat was a little overcooked/salted. I think the biggest disappointment was the plantains. I wished they was more flavor to them and it was a little closer in texture to fried plantains. Vegetarian Tacucho 4.5/5This was surprisingly great. I loved the addition of the plantains in the wrap and overall the flavors and the sauce worked very well together.Passion Fruit Juice 4/5Spilled a bit in the bag which was really unfortunate (this was not factored in my review, since these things happen), maybe there was a better preventative than saran wrap? The juice was overall tangy and on the sweeter side for me, but still great--wish there was passionfruit seeds in it! Would love to visit the store and try more food in a more fresh state (not delivery) and see if there's a difference. I'll be back!"

Patacon Steak seemed to be well done a day old and reheated. Like trying to chew tire rubber with no flavor. The plantain top and bottom hard as a frisbee disk. The other sandwhich with ham was also stale tasting and tortilla a little less rock like. Empanadas were okay the only part of the meal that was tolerable. Most went in the trash and this was $38 dollars later. Ugg!!!We had driven from Bayside as we had read such good things were so excited and wanted to love this place. No such luck. This was a disaster and we've eaten at many varied places to try something new and usually enjoy it.I would Not reccomend to eat here or take to go either as we did.Huge disappointment and 1 star rating and that's a gift only because of the empanadas.

Our first time going.  CYO Rice bowl was ok but flavor of all ingredients was a little bland.  Beef empanadas and Tres Leches were good. Giving 4 stars because the Patacon Paisa sandwich was very flavorful.

The steak  and cheese wasnt that good either. I didnt have a pleasant time, should have went to John's next door or the other subway on Bay Parkway, the people and place is a lot nicer. Sad... I hate throwing people under the bus like that. Save you money, go somewhere else."

This time I came with hubby and decided to try a sandwich adding bacon. I saw they have a new garliky herb oil (will try it next time). Yes, it is fast food but it is fresh baked warm bread with all of your sandwich fixings. Quick, easy, hot and fresh delish sandwiches."

However, if you get the fat guy, hes not very nice and makes your sandwich sloppy. The restaurant is always greasy and full of crumbs. He rushes to slap together your sandwich so he can watch movies in the back room. He swears loudly in the backroom... very uncomfoetable."

The table opposite the counter seats 3 people and the entire table had food remnants on it. I was trying to be especially clean due to corona virus, with my bottle of hand sanitizer, and then I'm stuck with a filthy table. The other table was taken. They need to clean the art on the wall too. It was covered in sauce splashes. The food was good."

Would happily return here.

As others have already written about, could the line be shorter/time go by faster when it comes to receiving food and drinks? Yes - however, it speaks to the demand and quality of the food, and also, once I ate my food, I genuinely understood why the line was so long and would wait in it again in a heartbeat. As I'm sure all of my gluten-free people can relate to, it is very hard to find a decent bagel. Well - you have found it my friends!!! You also have delicious drinks and an assortment of pastries and baked goods. It's just truly the spot you want to hit up."

The staff seemed so overwhelmed and they were (understandably) snippy to customers. There were people in person waiting over an hour for a toasted sandwich. Or a toasted bagel with jelly. My iced coffee was terrible. It's super packed and there's nowhere for anyone to stand and wait for their orders to be called. The lady behind me placed her order and when it finally came out - it was wrong! And she waited over an hour! I want to go back for the AMAZING gluten free bagel, but I don't want to deal with the workers and crowd again. Maybe I'll order online lol."

Double Chocolate Zucchini Bread (5/5) - by noon they were already out of their top sellers (was hoping to try a cinnamon roll or donut), but this loaf was recommended instead and wow, I'm so glad it was. The highlight of my morning! I've been to other gf bakeries in nyc and was unimpressed, but this loaf alone I'll be back for!! Not at all dry, a little crunch on the edges, and fudgy in the middle!!BYO Bagel Sandwich (4/5) - everything bagel with chive cream cheese, lox, and tomato/arugula/pickled onion. To be able to visit nyc and eat a bagel sandwich on a Sunday morning is amazing. Definitely the best gf bagel I've had. Probably not worth $17 on a regular basis, but tasty and enjoyed being able to partake in the classic sunday nyc experience. Will definitely be back to try more baked goods and sweet dishes (like the ricotta crepes or French toast dippers!)"

This is no exaggeration - bagels that actually taste like bagels, donuts that are actually flakey, perfect focaccia, etc etc etc. There is truly no place like modern bread and bagel. Every gluten free person I've taken here has been genuinely shocked. The location is super small, so expect a line and a slightly chaotic environment! When you walk in, you order bagels at the far end of the counter and then walk to the cashier to order any coffee or pastries. There will likely be tons of people coming in and out but the orders come out really quickly, so you won't have to wait long for your bagels.My gluten-eating husband says that MBB's bagels are better than most gluten bagels!"

Also love getting sandwiches, dinner etc here. There are lines on certain days and times (especially weekends) so try and avoid that.

I ordered a bunch of cinnamon raisin and froze them and even I must say the taste is indistinguishable from regular gluten bagels. I was going to order, but shipping is $19 (worth it for next day shipping though and with gas prices).We were coming to the city and this was our must stop for breakfast. I pre-ordered bagels ($50 minimum) so we wouldn't have to worry about them not being in stock. For breakfast we had split the breakfast grilled cheese which was scrambled egg, onion jam and cheddar on gluten free bread. Since everything is gluten free we also had to try the brioche donuts. I am a donut queen, and thought these were so good that they could stand up to some of the greats of regular donuts! Banana bread was also delicious. We got a cinnamon bun but haven't tried it yet. Iced mochas were great!Everything is gluten free, they are closed on Saturday, and they are a Kosher bakery so you will find vegan bacon, etc. I highly recommend here if you are Celiac or have a gluten intolerance, foods you miss but without compromise in taste. Check out the menu prior to coming and think about pre-ordering or ordering online if you want something specific or are crunched for time."

The bagel was dense (not a negative for me!) & savory/salty, which I prefer! The cream cheese was delicious too but my issue is the ratio...we asked for a good portion of cream cheese because we ran into a similar issue a few days prior (minimal cream cheese is a big issue for me) & we still barely had any on them. There were parts of the bagel that had basically zero cream cheese (you can see what I'm referring to in pic). I really liked the bagel itself but the missing cream cheese was a big miss."

361,SD2eMaR0iP48UJtab_4nag,11/1/2014,4 star rating,Juice/Salad bars are hard to come by in the Bronx so whenever I find one it's like an oasis in a dessert. 3D's is in a scarce area too so it was great that it opened recently. It's a take out place that also serves full breakfast and sandwiches. It's takeout only so there's no seating. Smoothies are reasonably priced and the salads are a flat price for all toppings. Solid fare and good service although theres one counter person and another in the grill/deli. A small operation that has a pretty good menu. Ive had tilapia on a hero and the salad and they get the thumbs up. The salad bar could have more toppings but it's great that you pay one rate for all.  This is s great option in the area for quality and healthy food
362,olRNNJCJ2TJvPRmjBiOcGA,1/25/2023,5 star rating,"Silky Kitchen offers the real deal in authentic Hunanese cuisine. As soon as I walked in and saw Chairman Mao's Favorite Braised Pork a true signature dish, on the menu, I knew this place was legit. A onetime resident of Hunan, my husband claims that the food at Silky Kitchen is as good as one might find in Hunan itself. A self-defined fast casual spot, Silky Kitchen offers top-notch restaurant-level rice and noodle dishes, with spiciness customizable from regular to medium to spicy to extra spicy. We ordered the hot and sour fish noodle soup and the  stir-fried chicken with chili paste over rice. The former was mind-blowingly delicious. The fish was so tender and the soup perfectly tart. Every bite was heavenly. So heart-warming for a cold winter day. The latter was too spicy for my taste, although my husband, a spice fiend, loved it. The service was quick and efficient. The space was large, clean, and very pleasant, comfortably fitting multiple strollers. We will surely be returning--to try Chairman Mao's Favorite Braised Pork no less."
363,olRNNJCJ2TJvPRmjBiOcGA,2/19/2023,3 star rating,"I'm not sure why this place was marked so high. This was overpriced and okay in my opinion. I will say the service and ambiance is great, there is plenty of seating and clean restrooms available. We ordered the beef stew, stir fried chicken with chili and sweet rice cake. The stir fried chicken was good. A majority of their items are spicy so I'd recommend checking with the waiter to ensure you know what you're ordering, the waiter was extremely patient with us and helpful. The sweet rice cake was good as well but not the best. Personally though if you're in the mood for Chinese I'd recommend going to Chinatown for more affordable food."
364,olRNNJCJ2TJvPRmjBiOcGA,1/26/2023,4 star rating,"Very authentic hunan food and they do not come to play with the spice. I would consider myself good at eating spicy food from various Asian cuisines but whew the medium spice level was actually very spicy. I think what makes this place unique is that it's slightly-""build your own"" in the sense that you can choose spice level and whether you want rice or noodles with whichever traditional hunan dish you select. We got the Hunan Fried Tofu as an appetizer which was by far my favorite bc it took me right back to China. For mains we got Hot & Sour Chicken Gizzard with noodles and Pork Liver With Pepper with rice - I am a noodle person so I liked the noodle dish more but the noodle type they give is on the thinner side, not chewy so it wasn't amazing to me but the chicken gizzard itself was great (just warning that there are a ton of peppers in every dish!). Pork liver with pepper was also very authentic. FYI they do not provide free tap water unless you bring your own bottle!"
365,olRNNJCJ2TJvPRmjBiOcGA,2/26/2023,4 star rating,"A self-service Chinese restaurant with a decently sized sitting area. It is a fast-food style in that you order at the back of the restaurant, pick up your own food and tidy up afterwards, and thus they also do not accept tips. Got a bowl of rice noodles with stew beef on mild spicy, well cooked beef and noodles, the broth is relatively light - but I actually liked it, especially on mild spicy it is comfy and warm, but not so rich that would be heavy on your stomach. Would be a great comfort food choice for a weekend lunch."
366,olRNNJCJ2TJvPRmjBiOcGA,12/2/2022,3 star rating,"Seeing all the high reviews, I was a bit disappointed when I tried the noodles at silky kitchen due to the taste and the price. I ordered the spicy and sour fish soup noodles and thought the taste was very mediocre. The fish slices didn't seem to be very fresh and tasted more like frozen fish. For the price I paid, around $17 for one soup noodle, I had expected it to taste better. I've had better noodles for cheaper. If you're looking for casual dining then you might enjoy dining at silky kitchen since you pick up the food and can just choose where you want to sit. I came with my friend and we didn't feel rushed to leave since there were plenty of seats available. The cashier was also very patient as we were deciding what to order for a while. Not sure I'd come back but maybe the other more popular dishes might be better!"

It's quick and casual - cafeteria style. I had the spicy and sour fish noodle soup and pork/shrimp/chives dumplings the first night. The soup was flavorful and soooo good! I'd always wanted to try this dish but have never had the chance. The dumplings were delicious - super juicy and the sauce (some sort of sweet vinegar?) was the perfect complement. It was so good I returned a second time and tried the pork rib and cuttlefish noodle soup. This was a lot more bland, so it's good for days you just want something simple. The cuttlefish was surprisingly tasty. Overall I preferred the fish but there's a time and place for both.Definitely worth a stop!"

So, I can see it as a great casual spot for getting work done while having a meal. As for the food, we ordered the beef stew, which consisted of some really tasty pieces of beef. However, the broth itself did lack salt and wasn't spicy. We also got the stir fried chicken in chili paste, which had pickled vegetables that unfortunately overpowered everything, much to my dismay. The chicken pieces themselves weren't particularly special, but got the job done. The portions here are adequate, and you might find yourself taking food home."
371,olRNNJCJ2TJvPRmjBiOcGA,10/13/2022,4 star rating,"A solid experience. Self service. Reasonably priced.Limited options for the carbo challenged. We began with the pork, chive and shrimp dumplings. These were savory and juicy. Beef tripe salad was tender and lightly seasoned. The best dish was the string beans, nicely seasoned and crisp. As La Portena doesnt do carbs, I was a solo act on noodles. I plumped for braised Hunan beef. The server steered me to medium which was surely hot enough. The beef was tender, the spice was nice, but the noodles could use an upgrade. The broth worked well to unify the dish.Decor is pretty basic. I'd take out next time."

Decided to hop on their anniversary deal . So did everyone else. Lines weren't too horrible due to CoVid they let about 10 at time which made perfect sense. I have to give the workers who bust their asses in their especially with the specials going around. Wasn't so keen on the cashier who didn't give a damn about the people or wanting them to ask them questions. In & out was her mentality. Which is fine. The whole chicken with sides of sweet corn and mash and a dessert peach cobb came out less then $20 I was happy. Granted nothing had any flavor, but the amount of chicken they had to make with the long lines. Can't really complain. Would I come back to pay full price? meh... But when they have specials.

What horrible customer service. The two biggest offenders are MARICELLA and GLORY. There was another man child who answered the phone, who, after hanging up on me once, put the phone down on the counter and left me hanging for almost 10 minutes, before the ""manager"" picked up. This person was Glory. I told her that on 6/15/2022, I called to inform MARICELLA that my dinner was not included in the order that my husband picked up. (Mind you, this was after calling several times and she HUNG UP ON ME before she was finally able to ""hear"" me.) Long story short, she apologized and told me that she was going to REFUND my money for my missing meal.Checked my bank today, 6/16/2022, and no such refund was processed. They were quick enough to TAKE my money - I clearly see that transaction, but not so much with the REFUND. I ask to speak to Maricella - ""She's not in today, can I help you?"" says Glory. I tell her what happened and she told me that if Maricella (who is apparently her boss) said she was going to refund the money, it would be refunded. I try to explain to her that it was, in fact, NOT refunded. ""Well, this will take up to 10 days to get a refund."" Yes, I understand that it may take that time to ""process,"" but there was no such indication on my statement to reflect that she processed the refund.I informed Glory that I would be leaving a bad review for this location (naming both her and Maricella), as well as leaving a bad review on the ""survey."" Yeah, she hung up on me. Corporate is going to get a phone call from me tomorrow and I will be asking for them to refund the price of my entire dinner for the inconvenience.SIDE NOTE: What level of stupid do you have to be to leave an entire meal out of an order? When I spoke to Maricella, she said the meal was there - would I like to come back and pick it up? Are you for real? First of all, this was a pickup on my husband's way home from work. We live almost 2 miles away from this location. Did I want my husband to stop eating his dinner so he could go get mine? Were they going to give me the cold dinner that had been sitting there? ""No, no,"" said Maricella, ""we will make you a fresh dinner."" No, thank you. Refund my money, please.We will absolutely not be going back to this location and probably (if I have anything to say about it) won't ever be ordering anything from Boston Market ever again. What are the odds I get a refund at all?"

Both times I order chicken Caesars salad as my side and it always come with no chicken so I basically pay 1.19 each for 3 and got none and this happen last time when I order 2 individual meals and both Caesar's came without chiceken too. Why not just take it off the menu at this point. Also when you pay 2.90 more for garlic herb and cheese they give almost no sauce definitely not worth it. Won't be ordering from here again

I frequently order from Better when I'm at work but, it seems everytime I order from here there is always something wrong or missing from the order, delivery also takes an hour plus. The food and smoothies are pretty good, I think the staff just needs to take a little more time reviewing orders instead of rushing people on and off the phone. Im willing to try them again, it just sucks when you wait an hour + for a 2 item order and only 1 thing comes; then have to wait another 30-45 minutes for the other item...

It is in the perfect area surrounded by neighborhood locals, schools, and is directly next to the train. I went in with my parents on a Saturday afternoon around 1:15 for lunch... by the time 1:30 rolled around, the entire restaurant was filled. It's the perfect healthier option for take out or a quicker sit-down lunch. The menu is huge and filled with many options for just about anyone (smoothies, wraps, salads, burgers, sandwiches, and even vegetarian/vegan options). Service was friendly and attentive and ready to accommodate in anyway possible even it got super busy. The prices are definitely reasonable for the quality and amount of food given. Salads run about $11 (with a protein already added in) and wraps about $9.50; these are much less expensive healthy options as far as take-out goes. Finally, the food was absolutely delicious and I enjoyed every bite. I left full and satisfied! My only advice would be to order ahead if you plan on picking up your food as it does get crowded and busy in the restaurant. This place is gonna do great!"

I was very surprised when I noticed it on my bill along with the new menu which is very confusing yet it seems like the owners are going to be paying for the Range Rover payments with the $1.50 charge(Ciro's pulled the same crap) as I won't be going any longer‍.. Louis, I think the people should we give an explanation on why you are padding the bill with an extra $1.50 & not giving it to the drivers..Shame on you!!!"

They currently have five locations around Manhattan, and I was at this Upper East Side Breads about two hours before closing so some items had sold out or were low in availability. But no matter, there were still many possibilities to choose from! Plus, due to Purim coming up, hamantaschen were up for grabs. I had an apple one ($3.50) and was really fond of the filling. I also tried the pain au chocolat ($4.75) and a brownie ($4.50). The brownie was all right; I would've liked it to have more of an intense chocolate flavor, but the texture was spot on. Saving the best for last, the chocolate croissant was awesome. The layers were dainty and buttery, and the chocolate inside was rich and fudgelike. The employees were nice, and indoor seating, outdoor seating, and restrooms were available. I'm glad I got to snack on a few of Breads Bakery's offerings, and I'll have to sample their famous babka and other goods on a future visit!"

Although the website said you could order ahead for pickup, I was unable to do so & the message that it was unavailable. Warm, aromatic & very very crowded, the line for the bakery case/counter was almost out the front door. Mr T went to stand in line while I perused the rest of the bakery. I could tell he was not thrilled about the line & since it was cold outside, having heavy coats, scarves & gloves on made for an uncomfortable mix. Fortunately, I discovered that you could help yourself to the goodies on the shelves & go to the coffee counter to check out instead of the main checkout. Low and behold, they had my babka on the shelf, along with linzer cookies, a lemon loaf & pastilles. I grabbed my goodies & motioned Mr T to step out if line & join me at the coffee counter. He was pleased. The only downside is that I didn't get to look at the bakery cases & pick out a selection of yumminess & see everything that they had. The lemon cake was a bit dry, the cookies were awesome. The chocolate babka was a hit at brunch (warmed in a 350° oven for 10-15 mins) before serving & well worth the trip uptown.***wanted to add a note. We bought an extra babka & froze it when we got home. We baked it in the oven at 250° for 15-20 minutes on New Year's Day & it was delicious."

Okay coffee.Got an assortment of things to try. -Iced Coffee-Black and White Cookie-Chocolate Almond Crossaint-Spinach Bureka-Feta Bureka-Cheese Straw-chocolate rugelachThe Jerusalem bagel and the Cinnamon Rolls were the standouts from this batch. Soft and chewy and good flavor for each. The biggest letdown was the black and white cookie.  They makes theirs layered with croissant dough, which may explain the price, but I prefer just to get a traditional one from a good corner bagel shop.  They spend so much attention on the chocolate that I think the vanilla side is left behind. The second biggest letdown was the rugelach.  Too airy and lacking intense chocolate goodness, especially for the price.The other baked goods were fine, perhaps of typical high-end bakeries, but just didn't pack a lot of flavor for the price and I wouldn't personally get them again.Coffee was just average.Perhaps some items are a little overhyped, but overall if you've got the spare change to splurge here, give them a try. While rather expensive, I will eventually make it back to try the signature babka."
408,tD2l7pW7DxiyDPLlZ9URcA,6/7/2022,5 star rating,Breads Bakery on Third Avenue is still my favorite. You can sit inside now and today I used their restroom for the first time. It's dark in there so bring your flashlight! It's high tech toileting. You wave your had over the tank and it flushes. I love their baked goods. I'm really addicted to the Spinach Boureka. Every couple months I have to have them. Two makes a perfect size meal for me. I'm definitely returning to this location. I highly recommend because their employees are great too. Prompt friendly service was provided today. I'm glad I decided to eat here.
409,tD2l7pW7DxiyDPLlZ9URcA,7/23/2022,5 star rating,"A real New York gem and classic. Let me tell you why.CHOCOLATE BABKA***Arguably the star of the show, and regarded by many as the best vodka in New York City, After trying it for myself I am convinced that it probably is. Fluffy chocolatey and maintains this very multi gooey chocolate texture despite eating it multiple days in a row. Soft and satisfying and not too sweet.CINNAMON BABKA***Didn't love this as much as the chocolate Babka but that's because of the inherent flavor profile itself. This while also soft and not too sweet contains finely chopped walnuts, Raisins, and of course cinnamon. Yummy and a great breakfast option.BLACK AND WHITE COOKIE***Another one of their claim to themes this amazing black-and-white cookie might be nothing that you've ever had before. The cookie itself is layered kind of like a croissant and has this dog a crunch when you're able to get it fresh. The cookie itself has black and white parts and the white half of it is layered with frosting that is soft and not like a shell like typical black and white cookies but so good and has a deep vanilla flavor that is really enjoyable and will keep me coming back for more.RUGELACH***Also amazing, SO SOFT to the bite and chocolates but not too sweet. It's like biting into a cloud, how do they do it!? I've had a variety of their other items including the chocolate almond croissant, various loaves of bread, their breadsticks - I especially love their olive and cheese breadstick - and they're all really good. You can't go wrong here but the items detailed above in specifics are the best."

I checked out this place because this is the only location that has ""black and white cookie"". What I didn't know was it was a pastry form of black and white cookie and not an actual cookie. It tasted like milk chocolate and vanilla version of danish. Also, the cinnamon bun was very fluffy and has right amount of sweetness to it."

We had breakfast here (about $3-$10/person depending what you order), as a break from the over priced hotel breakfasts.  Also, I noticed that the local NYC workers would come here to eat or buy items too (which for me is a good sign)."

I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this is a Dominican empanadas place. The aesthetics are very clean, modern and hip with a small seating area inside. The staff was super friendly, our register guy even went out of his way and set up a cute table and chairs outside of the restaurant so that we can enjoy the beautiful weather while we indulge in our empanadas. We ordered quite a few and they were all super delicious and flavorful, the favorites were the Shrimp, Ropa Vieja, and the loaded chicken that came with tomatoes, bacon and cheese. Being Dominican myself, it took me to my childhood drinking the Morír Soñando (to die dreaming). If you've never had it, give it a try! it's a silky concoction of orange juice, sugar, evaporated milk over ice. It's a nice smooth light drink perfect for a beautiful summer day.I wholeheartedly recommend Empanada City, whether you're looking for a snack, lunch or dinner and make sure to try the Morir Soñando you won't find a more refreshing drink then this."

Upon entry, we were greeted with tantalizing food smells. The restaurant had no indoor dining option available but, two tables outside. I noticed that most of the cashiers and service personnel wasn't wearing any masks.One of them had an air bud in her ear and I had to keep repeating myself. I didn't notice any music playing in the background so, I am guessing she was listening to her own music. It was just annoying to have to repeat myself a few times when she could just removed her headphones.  Overall, I actually felt like the service was a bit lacking and unfriendly to the point of being rude.I ordered originally a shrimp and a plain chicken but, then downsized because of the attitude of the staff and because I was a bit annoyed that they charge extra for sauce (.25c). I feel like usually empanadas come with sauce and it's free.The plain chicken empanada ($2.50) was delicious and stuffed full with filling. Sometimes, you would bite into an empanada and get more air than filling. This wasn't the case here. The chicken was flavorful and tender. The empananda didn't need sauce but, when Farabe went to buy a container, they said they didn't have any available.  I like that the outer layer was crispy and not greasy. Also very cute that they have a mold that prints the flavor on the crust in case you order multiple flavors."

Staff behind the counter is frumpy and my past four online orders all had some mistakes. One was lost entirely, in others the sauces I ordered weren't added to the bag, were incomplete or got mixed up - with no explanation.I will keep ordering empanadas here - at least for now, but I sincerely hope that the expansion in delivery doesn't result in the quality of the local service degrading any further."

The bartender was an older woman, probably 60s? Who asked if we wanted a drink. We politely declined the first time as we weren't ready for a drink yet and we were there to meet up with friends to leave as a group. A couple of friends decided they wanted to join the others and get drinks as well. Myself and one other friend did not want any drink at the moment. The bartender came around and basically told us ""you're at a bar, you have to buy a drink. You can't be in here just to hang out. We're a business and this is how we pay our rent."" Appalled and disgusted by her comment, we left. 7/9 from our group were drinking and met the minimum $25 tab requirement. I don't see the issue of two people not drinking? Anyways, she was completely rude, passive aggressive and made us uncomfortable and our time there awful. For your own sake, find another dive bar in soho. If she keeps that attitude up, she'll have more trouble paying rent when she's kicking people out like that."

The other people I was here with noticed you and we talked about it. It's an ok space and nice it has pool tables but the smell was really unnerving.

453,HxC2ZN010NxAFwjTqUVpzw,3/18/2023,5 star rating,I can't believe I have never reviewed this heavenly establishment. I've been coming to R2R for roughly 10 or so years. I'm incredibly glad I don't live within range of this place because I'd eat this and nothing more. I don't care about service but some days it does seem like the people rather really not be around customers and I can see why that place gets so packed. It's not much of sit down spot but more of go home and be super gluttonous  Overall I do wish the chefs of this delicious coma inducing rice dessert could manage to cut down on the excess sugar in the puddings because it's really not necessary but as a once in a very blue moon treat this will always be the spot to hit up.
454,HxC2ZN010NxAFwjTqUVpzw,3/12/2023,3 star rating,"Like other reviews, customer service is nonexistent and unwelcoming for a store filled with cute designs and themes. Never tried rice pudding so wanted samples and felt an unwillingness when asking. The red velvet itself is pretty good and I do enjoy rice pudding after my first time here. The smallest size was heavy for both my partner and me so share with a group! Don't get one for each person. This was checked off my NYC list but feeling unwilling to come back"
455,HxC2ZN010NxAFwjTqUVpzw,2/27/2023,3 star rating,"Tasty rice pudding but portions are too big. Even the smallest ""solo"" size is good enough for 3+ people but you can only choose 1 flavor...One of the restroom was very stinky and literally had shit (dog? human?) on floor and hope they do better job at monitoring and cleaning."
456,HxC2ZN010NxAFwjTqUVpzw,2/21/2023,3 star rating,"Customer service was nonexistent. The staff don't look at you, greet you, or smile at you. They are quite strict about their 3 sample policy (you can try a max of 3 flavors). Also, when my friend ordered an epic (2 flavors), they gave 2 spoons and when I ordered right after, the guy didn't give me a spoon and told me to just get it from my friend.  The rice pudding fell flat to my expectations. They offer a lot of flavors, but some of them end up tasting pretty similar. I feel like the portion size is also too big. It's too much pudding to finish at once. If they had an even smaller option to the solo, I would be more likely to get again. The bowl it comes in is also super messy. It's so low, the pudding almost always spills out, so it ends up on the table, on your hands. Just unpleasant to eat from."

458,HxC2ZN010NxAFwjTqUVpzw,2/13/2023,5 star rating,"Rice to Riches in NYC is a must-visit spot for pudding dessert lovers. The portions are filling, and the many flavor options to choose from make it difficult to decide. The staff is quick and provides great service. I highly recommend trying the Category 5 Caramel, Chocolate Chip Flirt, and Coast to Coast Cheesecake flavors. Overall, a fantastic experience!Category 5 Caramel is a delicious and indulgent flavor of rice pudding available at Rice to Riches in NYC. The rich and creamy pudding is infused with a smooth and buttery caramel flavor that is simply irresistible. The texture of the pudding is thick and velvety, and the sweetness is perfectly balanced with a slight saltiness to enhance the overall taste. This flavor is perfect for those who love caramel and want to indulge in a decadent dessert. Whether you enjoy it at the shop or take it to go, Category 5 Caramel is sure to leave a lasting impression on your taste buds.If you're a fan of chocolate, the Chocolate Chip Flirt flavor at Rice to Riches in NYC is a must-try. The pudding is rich and velvety, with just the right amount of chocolate chips to add a slight crunch and burst of sweetness. The chocolate flavor is intense but not overwhelming, and it blends perfectly with the creamy rice pudding base. It's a dessert that will satisfy any chocolate lover's cravings.Coast to coast cheese pudding is rich, creamy, and full of classic cheesecake flavor, with a perfectly balanced sweetness that's not too overpowering. The texture is smooth, velvety, and luxurious, making it a treat for the senses. The crust-like topping is made of finely crushed graham crackers, which adds a delightful crunchy texture that perfectly complements the creamy pudding base.I highly recommend Rochelle and Brianna at Rice to Riches for their exceptional customer service. They were attentive, friendly, and went above and beyond to ensure a positive experience. I appreciate their professionalism and would gladly return to Rice to Riches to receive their outstanding service again."
459,HxC2ZN010NxAFwjTqUVpzw,11/27/2022,4 star rating,"This place just gave the NY twist to the humble rice pudding or as we call ""kheer"" in India. Quite a clever concept, easily appetizing flavors and decent prices. I was initially skeptical of trying R2R as am not a big fan of rice based desserts. But one bite into their cheesecake flavor and I was instantly taken aback by its deliciousness. It's perfectly balanced taste wise - right amount sweet, creamy and fluffy rice enhance the texture of this amazing dessert. I'm sure by now you must have bookmarked this place - just freaking go now!"
460,HxC2ZN010NxAFwjTqUVpzw,7/20/2022,5 star rating,"Context: not a huge fan of rice pudding BUT if I were to recommend a rice pudding to someone this would be the place. Similar to an ice cream parlor this place lets you sample the plethora of flavors. Vanilla, Panne cotta, chocolate, caramel, and many more. I went with the caramel and it overall tasted like a good caramel pudding with rice inside. The taste itself was overall well done but the texture is not my personal favorite. All in all, good service, trendy decor, and objectively good rice pudding."
461,HxC2ZN010NxAFwjTqUVpzw,7/2/2022,3 star rating,"The rice pudding here tastes better than it looks, but that's not saying much. I got the cheesecake and cookies and cream flavors. They were both pretty mediocre; they didn't really taste like the flavors as advertised, they were too sweet, and the pudding was too mushy for my liking. The cookies and cream one was better than the cheesecake one though. The portions are pretty large so I'd recommend sharing even their smallest size -- maybe if it was tastier I'd say otherwise. The decor of the shop is very interesting as they literally call you out for being fat and say that you're going to die soon so it doesn't matter if you eat a lot of calories. It's funny but a little uncomfortable given that these types of signs are all over the store. Regardless, I disagree with the sign; the pudding is not worth the calories because it is not that good."

464,RwFS9iF0fo9XrJuvduQdFg,9/19/2021,4 star rating,"Stayed here two nights in September while in town for a couple ball games. I would say that when I was trying to find a place to stay I wanted something close to things but far enough away from the main action, valet parking, and close to subway. This isn't the biggest building, and our room was somewhat small - but keeping in mind it's NYC - can't really hold it against the score. The main problem which ended up not being one was valet - there isn't any during Covid. ????? Ok? Down the street is a parking garage (no in and out service) and from Friday midday to Sunday morning it came to $108. Yikes but again - it's NYC. The most troubling part was the vaccine card policy in the breakfast area - as I had to show my card to checkin so why would I have to show it again? I'm staying there so obv I showed it, and this isn't a restaurant where people can just walk in and have breakfast? Bc of Covid you have to ask for housekeeping so make sure to do that. Overall it was clean, right down street from Grand Central Station and subway access, and I would stay here again no question"

Julio was adorable and so nice with anything we needed. The room was clean and the water pressure and temperature was great. Got super hot quickly. Felt like the AC could be adjusted because it didn't feel like it would get cool enough. The tv would also skip and the sound wouldn't match the show. It was every few words would glitch. All in all great deal for NY prices and was clean.

They were very gracious and refunded my one night stay. They said they got an exterminator to come look at the room and the exterminator found nothing and were unable to identify the insect we found in our bed. While the manager handled this situation gracefully I feel others should know there's a threat of unidentified bed bugs in this hotel

Nice location far enough away from the major tourist attractions but this is NYC baby...the 2nd greatest city in the world (sorry NY'ers, London rules)...nothing is that far. Lyft, uber, the public transportation will get you wherever you need to go. Youre not living here, your sleeping here and well worth it.by the way I had read a review about the girls at the front desk. They are truly the best! Exited to see you and doubly excited to help.

Tape left on the ceiling from a previous guest.  Shower curtain stained and mold in shower, desk chair ripped, air filter dirty with fuzz (hello Covid?).  A few times the hall reeked of marijuana.  No mini fridge or microwave. We didn't even mind no housekeeping unless asked for, but Hilton should be ashamed.  They are a hugely wealthy and successful international company and to allow this property near the UN to become so disheveled is shameful.  On a a fair note, I appreciate free boxed breakfast and water bottles.

471,RwFS9iF0fo9XrJuvduQdFg,6/14/2021,2 star rating,"Save your money!!!!!!!!! From the moment we got to this hotel there was nothing but issues. We had 3 rooms and of course only 1 room was ready at check in (3:00). We walked into this room and it had a sealed lysol ""Your room has been clean"" sticker. We walk in and it definitely did not smell clean more like someone had been passing gas in there throughout the day. Our toilet paper holder was broken, stains on the sheets and the tiny room looked super worn out.We found out that we had to schedule within 24 hours for them to come clean the room and restock everything, take the trash out etc. so that is what we did the following day. They never came and when we went back to the front desk the previous front desk girl never even scheduled it. When we told the girl working that one big reason we wanted our room cleaned is that my bed had stained sheets. She replied with yeah they wash them but a lot of the times all the stains will just stay in the sheets. The correct reply would have been oh no I'm so sorry I will send up new ones immediately. Which I did eventually get new ones and i changed the sheets.The entire weekend we had to go down to get new towels, ask for clean sheets and change them ourselves, restock our own things like toilet paper and take our trash out. The walls in this hotel were paper thin. We could hear the 6am alarm of the room next to us so clearly I thought it was my alarm. Our other two rooms thankfully smelled nice and seemed cleaner than the first, however in one of the rooms the tv didn't work and after 2 days that same room had all the water stop working. Seemed like issue after issue when it should have been a relaxing fun girls weekend for my moms 60th birthday. Quite unfortunate!Only reason this place earned 2 stars was our super nice front desk girl as we checked out. Also one other front desk girl who helped try to order us a lyft when we were running late for reservations. I ended up only snapping one picture of the super beat up chair in our room, however most of the furniture was like this (worn out, scrapes and stains)."

We ordered guacamole and chips, a kids cheese & chicken quesadilla, steak burrito, pulled beef burrito, rice & beans and sweet plantains. Everything was delicious. My husband enjoyed his pulled beef burrito and the spicy sauce that came with it. The kids went to town on the quesadillas and guac. I absolutely love sweet plantains, so they were a great dessert after my steak burrito. Portions are pretty decent, btw. The gentleman who took my order over the phone was very pleasant and patient, and answered all of my questions. My order was ready within 15 min, and it was an easy transaction. The bill came out to under $70 to feed a family of 4, which is a fair price nowadays. So I was very happy with the service as well!"

Tonight I ordered a swirl milkshake and it had an odd taste. I went back in and told them that I did not like the way it tasted and that maybe something was wrong with it. (Something I almost never do) The manager immediately says nothing wrong with the milkshake, the ice cream or the milk. He then takes out the milk tastes it and it says nothing wrong with it. Shrugs me off and does not offer to make me a new one, offer me something else or even my money back. We live in the neighborhood and have many friends that go to that location. They have lost our family as customers as well as my friends and family in the neighborhood. I guess the customer is never right at this location.

I came to the store to purchase an ice cream cake for my daughter who has peanut allergies.  I was assured that the ice cream cake I purchased was peanut-free, and it was produced in a nut-free facility. After leaving the store, I further inspected the ingredients on the label, I noticed that it clearly stated the ice cream cake was made on equipment that also produced peanut products. When I returned to the store and explained to the store manager that the information he gave me was erroneous, and requested a refund, he proceeded to rudely reprimand me (obnoxious screaming). After several verbal exchanges, he reluctantly decided to give me a refund. While processing the refund, he incorrectly issued another customer a refund instead of me.  He then went on a verbal tirade stating that he lost money -- it was HIS error.  He finished the process, threw the receipt at me, and told me to ""get the hell out of my store!!!"".PLEASE DO NOT SHOP AT THIS CARVEL LOCATION, TO DO SO IS VALIDATING SUCH RUDE AND INDECENT BEHAVIOR."

It's better than your typical Carvel, but at the same time they're a chain, people..... what do you expect? Mostly young inexperienced workers probably high-school or college-age kids. But most fast-food/chain places pay minimum wage so it's highly presumptuous to expect white glove treatment. And I actually like this Carvel better than most others. They honor the discounts they offer like certain days have BOGO on the sundaes and milkshakes. We went recently and my milkshake cup was almost full but the kid behind the counter went through the hassle of going back to add more ice cream and milk just to make sure it was full to the brim."

So after the 2nd time tasting the cuisine here, I can say it's not very good quality. The whitefish pieces are quite small. To have a side of grits with 2 pieces of fish is exorbitant at $10. The worst part was that the grits were incredibly watery and inedible. Not only was it very runny, the grits had no flavor and needed a lot of salt. I 100% advise strongly against ever ordering the grits here because they do not know how to make them properly."

The quality of the food has declined DRAMATICALLY. Everything taste OVER SEASONED, OVER SALTED, OVER COOKED or UNDERCOOKED. The collard greens I received today tasted days old and SALTY. The bake Mac was stale. The fried tilapia was BURNT. The chopped crab was EXTRA SALTYYYYY and just uneatable  The only thing I enjoyed was the corn bread (which they finally didn't leave out my order like they always do) and the iced tea which was a surprise because sometimes it's overly sugary or just right. Today it was just right. Not sure if they have new cooks who just don't care about the quality they're serving or the over all restaurant doesn't care anymore."

I'm not familiar with Chinese yogurt I guess what they use is similar to those other kinds?I didn't know what to get and was undecided about the mango or the original purple rice. After the really nice cashier explained it to me ""It's just like a smoothie! ""I realized that I'd rather try their purple rice $6.50, because the mango was probably similar to mango lassi.It was good, not too sweet, it's more like a supplement to Boba tea, can't compare it to rice pudding. The rice grains were a little too hard to be compared to cooked rice pudding also. There's a lot more chewing involved. It's not bad and it's filled me up after my light meal of dumplings, and hopefully the yogurt is good for my gut. But for $7, and watching them make the drinks which is just yogurt, a fruit or a grain ingredient, and liquid; I'd rather just make this at home."

I highly recommend trying yogurt drinks at least once!I got the purple rice yogurt and the mango yogurt. It's not a big drink for the price by any means, but if you're accustomed to paying ~$7 for a dessert drink, this is worth trying! The purple rice is exactly as you would expect in a yogurt drink, but it's not an unwelcome addition. The mango yogurt was great- the mango chunks/puree was light and sweet.

As a lifelong fan of kheer and rice pudding, I had to try this yogurt and rice. The spot is a cute hole in the wall with a pretty expansive menu that's fairly priced. I tried one of the signature drinks, Duomi's Purple Rice Matcha Yogurt ($6.75). It was definitely interesting. A bit tart, it tasted like rice pudding that may have started to curdle but not in a nasty way. I found it really rich and filling without being too sweet. The purple rice made it feel just like rice pudding as I found myself chewing rice as I drank the yogurt drink. It was around an 8/10 for me. While this type of drink may not be for everyone, I think it's worth a shot if you're in the area. The spot is very upbeat and in a busy area and seems to attract a lot of teens.

528,hTgz6L9PbB5f5fGF5lMWUA,4/6/2022,3 star rating,"I've been very curious about this new drink which seems to be on-the-rise in the beverage space.  The store is located on the rather upscale block on Prince between Roosevelt and 39th Ave.  Needless to say, forget about parking or stopping anywhere nearby.  Inside is just an ordering counter with some space for waiting.  I ordered the signature A1 purple rice yogurt for $6.50. There was no line except a small group who had already placed orders, but I still ended up waiting for a good 15 minutes before getting my drink.  They really need to get additional blenders to speed things up.  There is just one universal size for all yogurt drink, and while it feels smaller than a medium cup, the drink is dense and heavy.  So you do feel there's value and it will fill you up.  Now, this was the first time I had this rice yogurt drink and it was not what I had expected.  It's a lot thicker and not much taste except for some sourness - imaging mixing something like plain yogurt with overnight oats and cottage cheese!   If you're a health buff, you might like it; but if you're a sugar-loaded Boba tea addict or sport a taste bud that looks for heavy Sichuan spices, you will likely struggle.  What threw me off the most was the purple rice. It's not grounded and you have to really chew before downing it.  I suppose it's modeled after Boba, but this doesn't work for me.   So for me now the novelty is over and done, I don't see any reason I'd try it again."

The grape yogurt drink was real grapes blended into a yogurt drink with jasmine tea - fragrant but clashing sour/sweet. While I'm not a fan of yogurt drinks like this, but if you like sour yogurt drinks, you'll enjoy these."

I was asked what kind of rice I wanted and I told the server rice and beans and just got plain old white rice. Total fail. This place seems better as a bar than a restaurant. Heavy pours on the margaritas, but yeah don't eat here. Watch the game and have a beer instead."

We waited for 40 minutes and only reason we got the food because I went inside to pay for the drinks and cancel the food order. The food was not even hot, the servers were overall rude and I had to ask for my bill and pay. Food was nothing special and we ate our meals in half of the time it took to get it. I wish I would have read reviews from others before coming here. We were also missing some beans but at that point we didn't care after waiting for so long. There are many other restaurants in the area so please avoid this one.TIENEN QUE EVITAR! Me encanta apoyar a los establecimientos locales (especialmente a los restaurantes durante COVID), pero esta fue la peor experiencia de cena. Esperamos 40 minutos y la única razón por la que obtuvimos la comida fue que entré para pagar las bebidas y cancelar el pedido de comida. La comida ni siquiera estaba caliente y las meseras no eran amables.  Tuve que pedir la cuenta para pagar. La comida no era nada especial y comimos la comida en la mitad del tiempo que tardaron en traerla. Ojalá hubiera leído las críticas de otros antes de venir aquí.

Their scallion cream cheese is TO DIE FOR and their SEC is solid as well.I'd say the biggest difference between this and other famous bagel places are that the bagels are less plump and more chewy, rather than the dense cakey consistency at TSB.

We've been coming here roughly once a week to stock up on bagels. Buy 6, get 1 free. You need to come here early sometimes. On some days, some customers buy them out. My sister for example, when she came to visit from Texas. First thing she did was come here and bought out their bagels on the day she was flying back to Texas. There's no good bagels down there apparently.The service here is great, there are few table and chairs. This bagel shop has been in this neighborhood as long as I could remember.

There were a few times during the pandemic when they didn't have bialys at all or closed hours early bc they sold out of everything, but by and large I can count on getting a bialy if I come before 11 on the weekend. If they're out, I get a toasted sesame flagel with cream cheese. I've never gotten their bagelwiches but for your classic NYC breakfast of bagel and coffee, this place hits the spot.

I got the house of cardamom, rosemary road, spicy rooster and purple pig. Three of each and they even threw in a few extra!  I wish I could give them 5 stars but there were a few things that took them down a notch. First, one of the guys behind the counter was really grumpy to the point that he made me feel like I was a nuisance for asking if there was a minimum number of doughnuts for each flavor. I thought it was a pretty valid question but it seemed to annoy him to have to talk to me at all. The other guy chimed in and said there was no minimum so I planned to try two each of six flavors since it was my first time there and I wanted to sample as much as possible without being too annoying by getting one of each. So then the first guy was at the register when I went to order and I told him I wanted a dozen. He says ""OK so you can choose four flavors"". I was a little confused since the other guy said there was no minimum! But I didn't complain and just chose four out of the six I had planned. It seemed reasonable to have a 3 per flavor minimum even if that's not what they told me. Second, I didn't really taste a big difference between the flavors except the purple pig which definitely stood out and was my favorite. I expected them to be more distinctly different but they were otherwise so good it didn't matter too much. Third, they are pretty pricy considering they are bite sized doughnuts. $1 each with a minimum order of 6 is more than I'll usually wanna spend.

We ate the buns walking out of the store and after eating the fluffy, sweet taro filled buns, we looked at each other and literally ran back in. The woman was closing but had us come back in for another round of buns. I took a picture of the outside just so I could remember where to go for these again. It was such a wonderful mix of flavors and the texture was incredible. It's a small hole in the wall and we were in and out. Using cash will save you on the credit card fee, and I'm just so happy we went back for more. Of all the things we ate last night, this one stood out the most.

We had already done our fair share of donut eating last night and we decided to come in anyways. We ordered the taro buns and a loaf of bread and made our way out. We ate the buns walking out of the store and after eating the fluffy, sweet taro filled buns, we looked at each other and literally ran back in. The woman was closing but had us come back in for another round of buns. I took a picture of the outside just so I could remember where to go for these again. It was such a wonderful mix of flavors and the texture was incredible. It's a small hole in the wall and we were in and out. Using cash will save you on the credit card fee, and I'm just so happy we went back for more. Of all the things we ate last night, this one stood out the most.

675,rehmlZmUNL2AthW-VTXJJQ,2/24/2022,3 star rating,"Hmm..........I'm torn. On the one hand, I had a very delicious sweet and sour dish from here with a decent Thai tea. The pineapple in the sweet and sour actually didn't bother me and it was jam packed with veggies which I really appreciated. The broth was sweet and savory, exactly how it should be. Perfection. On the other, I had the worst ginger meal here ever. I mean woah! The ginger was all encompassing and so strong you can barely taste anything else. The ginger was most definitely fresh but far too much. Dishes require balance and this one had none. Overall, I've ordered here a few times and some dishes are better balanced than others. Also it could just be hit or miss with whoever is in the kitchen. Not sure. No stamps unfortunately, but if you're in the neighborhood  and in a bind for Thai, go for the sweet and sour anything."
676,rehmlZmUNL2AthW-VTXJJQ,1/12/2022,4 star rating,The only reason for this place not getting a 5 star is because of the poor seating. It's winter & the seats next to the door gets hit with the cold air once the door opens. The heat isn't on either or just barely on. Food: delicious! If you want spicy and I mean real spicy .. they will make it! The shrimp was made well. The duck was delicious and moist. The seasoning was on point. The soup was yummy. The curry puff pastry was great. The Thai Iced tea made well & not sickly sweet or super bitter. Decor: needs some revamping. Seating isn't very comfortable. Staff: friendly. Parking: it's either good or really bad!

684,vx2JV9juVzSBRGWHOZCTAQ,2/23/2023,4 star rating,"We feasted, y'all. We popped in (no rezzie) for a very late lunch on a Friday afternoon. Thankfully, they were able to immediately accommodate our group of three. The restaurant is extremely cozy, and they do have a spacious patio for the al fresco diners. We started off with bread and olive oil, grape leaves, and lentil balls (more like lentil patties). The beau had the Sultan's Delight (chunks of lamb or chicken in tomato sauce over eggplant puree), while I opted for the chicken shish kebab. But we didn't stop there! You can't dine at a Turkish restaurant on a chilly day without ordering a few cups of Turkish tea and Turkish coffee, along with walnut baklava, kazandibi (turkish custard). But my favorite dish out of this entire experience was the börek (spinach and feta in filo). It came highly recommended in a lot of their Yelp reviews, and I'm so glad we ordered it. Afiyet olsun! (may you have an appetite)"

My only qualm is the chicken didn't come with hummus you had to order it separately. However, they had a good selection of wines. I enjoyed that they had Turkish music playing and had great service. The waiters checked in throughout to ensure if we needed anything. Great service. Overall, would recommend.Ambiance - 4/5 Value - 4/5 Food - 5/5"

While in New York we took a break from pizza and food carts on the corner and went with some mediterranean. Stumbled upon ABA which is super close to Central Park and IS. A. MUST. if you enjoy this cuisine and happen to be in NYC. First great indicator was the hospitality, friendliness, and compassion from the staff. Despite this being our first time here, they treated us exceptionally. No rushing, no pressure, just excellent service. We ordered the Iskender & doner kebabs, sigara borek, manti, hummus, and baklava. All were absolutely delicious! So tender, robust flavor, and prepared better than some places I've been to in the Middle East. Out of the hundreds of restaurants in NYC, we came back again the next day because of pleased we were with our experience. Overall had an phenomenal experience at ABA and would highly recommend this place to anyone. Can't wait to come back."

It's really improved a way much better. Everything got so tasty. now they have a lunch special menu which is three courses appetizer, main, tea or desert $19.95I had a lentil soup which was amazing like deserves more than 5 stars. They served with warm bread calls pide. As a entrees I ordered Adana kebab. Even though it's a lunch special, the portion sizes are pretty big. The Adana kebab was so juicy and well cooked. Al the spices are the right place. Then of course I won't pass the Turkish dessert. My favorite is rice pudding. It was excellent. After that I could not stop thinking about ABA's food and I also ordered for dinner as well. I had a kibbeh soup and almond pudding. If you are around there I extremely recommend ABA. Now, can't stop thinking about it. IT WAS SO GOOD"

The staff was attentive and gave recommendations and answered questions well enough.Coming to food, tried the lunch menu - 3 course pre-fix. The appetizers came promptly and accompanied bread, quiet fresh and well sized portions. Entree tried chicken adana, and very well seasoned and flavorful rice and salad - perfect meal. Followed by Turkish tea. They even made off-menu item - Kunefe for us on request but it was a 15 mins wait, well worth it.Overall a great Turkish spot and must try if you are in the area."

I came here for lunch on a Saturday and the restaurant was only about half full. The waitstaff was very quick and responsive.We ordered the lamb shank, grilled whole branzini and grilled dorado. The portions were massive and a very good deal for the price. The lamb shank was extremely tender and melted in my mouth. The fish were wonderful as well--grilled to perfection. For dessert we had the baklava and pudding. The baklava was nice and crispy but I found both desserts a bit cloyingly sweet.Would definitely recommend this place for a lowkey meal around Columbus circle!"

692,KvLrI20Abz6F9WzAIHmyWQ,3/2/2020,3 star rating,"With Cafe R and the hotel having a deal for us to get free breakfast was a great idea we thought we should try out their 10.99$ buffet deal. Their breakfast deal with Hotel Pennsylvania was very grim and didn't have a whole lot of options but that's what you get for free. With the complimentary breakfast it included fresh fruit, your choice of either bread, or types of danishes and or muffins, choice of juice or coffee. The highlight of the meal was the muffins. The muffins was were always so moist and flakey. The fruit didn't always taste fresh and were really soggy by the time you got to them. The reason behind the 3 stars is their buffet. We wanted to eat cheaper on our last night in NYC and we decided to eat here. Huge issue here with the buffet is that nothing is named, no hot lamps and all the food were almost as cold as the outside temperature. The chicken tenders were the only thing worth eating even though it was cold. I highly recommend coming early when they first put it out so you're not getting older colder food."

695,KvLrI20Abz6F9WzAIHmyWQ,5/6/2022,3 star rating,STEER CLEAR OF THE BUFFET. It's overpriced and today I found a bug in my rice. I was already back at work and my break was over so I wasn't able to go back.Other than that the variety is good and so are the prices. The breakfast is hard to beat in terms of taste and price. Some reviewers have experienced poor service but I have never any issues and I've been coming her for 3 or 4 years.
696,KvLrI20Abz6F9WzAIHmyWQ,6/23/2021,1 star rating,"They sell overpriced buffet food that's been left out for hours. I got a stomach ache and abnormally bloated after eating a freshly overcooked steak (the cook was multitasking and left it cooking for longer) and vegetables that were slimy, mushy and not fresh. I went right back to tell the owner or manager and he said he was going to check with another manager and told me to come back tomorrow. Bad customer service. The staff aren't approachable or nice. I was waiting to place my order and the cook washing pots and pans in the back got upset when I politely asked if the kitchen was open and who I could place an order with (it was still open and not around closing time.) He said it was obvious that he was busy and then begrudgingly prepared my order. Every time I've come here, they've been understaffed (bad management.) There weren't nearly as many food options as there used to be because of the pandemic. On multiple occasions, the bathrooms weren't clean and barely had any water to wash your hands or to flush the toilets (I've unfortunately seen piles of disgusting things inside of them.) It seems this business is getting worse over the years. I wish the food tasted as good as it looks in the picture that I took of it. I'll add it to this review."
697,KvLrI20Abz6F9WzAIHmyWQ,5/4/2019,2 star rating,"Went here because we had a food coupon we didn't want to waste. Went around 11 in the morning so their breakfast counter was shut. The place is okay with a buffet area and made to order counters that are open at different times. They seem to have little bit of every cuisine. The food counters are okay price wise but the buffet and on the go items are a total rip off ($3 for a cup of yogurt? , no thank you!). Ordered the scrambled eggs with toast, instead got an omelette (too lazy to scramble 'em eggs bro?). The buffet items were heated with steam from the bottom so basically they were barely warm. Some tables weren't clean and the floor definitely needed some cleaning. I'd say breakfast is the only worthwhile time to go here. Avoid otherwise."

Huge space, nicely done. Freshly made at lunch time 12:45pm. Enjoyed an under $4!!!! Fabulous & so delicious lunch/snack. Wanted to just try a little to decide if things were as good as they looked, and yesssss, they are!I had the freshly made, lightly egg battered, White Fish, & a bit of lobster with melted cheese. Both really good. Where on earth can you get this for $.Nicely made food items. Lovely looking fresh fruit salads, too bad a woman was tasting it!! NO TASTING!! Minus ONE STAR because, I feel they should have a self serve water put her, or huge covered water container with a spout, like Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken has--it's even filtered water at Blue Ribbon.I asked for a cup for water, figuring they'd at least have self-serve pitchers, but she said to ask the Juice Bar station....so I walked the 1/4 mile lol, place is huge & nice, juice bar pointed to their sink behind counter. I said never mind. I got the feeling he would have let me go behind counter & use sink to fill my styrofoam cup. Just a feeling.So MY SUGGESTION is to have a self serve COLD Water area. Good eats are here. So I actually ate here for under $4, which is also under $5!  Lol"

The food is like a ""greatest hits"" compilation of everything you can grab and go in the frozen foods aisle of your food store. They have 200 bagels on the line EVERY ONE OF THEM PRE MADE WITH CREAM CHEESE.....Why would you pre-make every bagel with the same spread? Even if you don't offer any other spread at least give people the option to take the bagel plain.You proceed to ask this question to the person working the line and they look at you like you have 12 heads growing out of your shoulders......

Its so convenient on the same block as Jack's. Woah baby what a spacious food court with stations on both sides of different varieties of food from Pizza, Burgers, Chinese, Mexican, Sushi, and so many more of which I took a quick glance. I went for the Hot & Cold Buffet and I remember to take a plastic container than styrofoam. Definitely a lot of more choices for the Hot Buffet than I have seen at as the cashier agrees with me as it was her 4th day hehe. I showed her my Yelp check-in 10% off for Cooked Food but wouldn't it be everything since they have to cook the raw ingredients...am I right? lol There's more seating upstairs as well some tables by the cashwrap area. I noticed a live band going to perform as I was leaving Cafe R. If you are around the neighborhood and starving, come here since its open 24/7!"

The server seemed a tad surly at first but I think that was just a communication/culture difference because he was very attentive throughout our meal. He did only give us the lunch special menu at first (the usual ""over rice"" dishes for $8.95) but we were in the mood for other types of food. The beef in the chow fun was very tender and the duck super flavorful and juicy. We asked for some ginger sauce to go with the duck and they gave a very generous portion! The fried rice was a bit on the bland side but that complemented the duck and pork bits in the rice very well. The downside was the wonton soup, broth was really salty. Overall, we would come back if we're in the area again."

We came here on a Monday night for dine in. It was just us dining so I have to say, we felt safe. All the staff had their mask on and there were bottles of purell on every table and they offer disposable chopsticks and cups to up the protection of their customers. Lastly, they also ask for our contact info to stay in compliance for covid tracing so that was a plus. As for the restaurant, it is well spaced out and they have a partition to separate each table, which was a huge plus in my book. Now to the best part, their food! We ordered their saute chinese cauliflower, twin lobsters with egg foo noodles and peking pork chops for dinner. All the dishes were flavorful, well executed and helped hit all the right spots. As for service, our waiter was super attentive. I guess because we were the only people dining there but regardless I appreciate the fine customer service he provided. It make us felt well taken care of.  Our waiter also told us they they are usually more busy during the lunch time as people like to take advantage of their $15 lobster deal.  All in all, I like this place. They offer great service and their food are always consistent and tasty."

The soup we ordered was super good! The flavors were on spot, not too salty! I didn't like the crabs too much, the breading had a weird taste. My favorite dish was the fish and tofu. The fish at first had a weird sweet taste to it, but it goes away. The seafood dish with the noodle bowl was not my favorite. It was really oily near the bottom. The lobsters tasted like how they would at any other Chinese restaurant."

We also got vegetables that was cooked on a nice thick sauce. Finally we got salt pepper pork chops, there was a bit of spice, the garlic crisps, and the meat was so tender and delicious!

712,M4SNcEH7lEOqv7ts8azqAQ,2/10/2023,4 star rating,A super divey dive bar that I was told was a rite of passage for visitors to the Lower East Side. Came here on the way to another bar and we all took a shot of their special Assjuice (this tasted like pineapple and you couldn't really tell what liquors were used). Plenty of indoor seating and the crowd was quite eclectic. They have games as well as TVs.
713,M4SNcEH7lEOqv7ts8azqAQ,12/5/2022,5 star rating,Cheap dive bars are really hard to find these days. This one pretty much fits the bill and I'm kind of floored that I've never been here. Everything is $2 off until 8pm. Which rounds everything on tap out to be about $5. After happy hour ends there's canned beer for $4 and something as well called 'ass juice'. I was tempted. Trust me. I was tempted. But the ass juice will have to wait for another day. Someone said it tastes sweet. But they didn't comment on if it's actually good or not. It was just a 'it's sweet/no comment' kind of description. There's a pool table in the back and I guess they allow outside food because they didn't seem to have a problem when I brought in slices from a $1.50 pizza shop next door. Wasn't too crowded when I went and surprisingly more sanitary than other dives I've been to. So kuddos for that.

I picked up one day and the next day I did delivery. Estimated delivery  was 1:40pm on the website but it was delivered by 1:20pm. So quick! Classic Falafel: so tasty! The cucumber salad in it is so fresh, the arugula is flavorful, the falafel is crispy. It is quite filling. Cheese hawawshi: it's a cheese burger in a pita. The pita bread is called Baladi bread but it's much better than a pita. It has flavor. Hawawshi is not like your regular cheeseburger. This is much tastier and healthier. Not greasy at all. Dukka fries: those spices are flavorful. I tried the various dipping sauces. The hibiscus tahina is best with the fries...or just have the fries alone without any sauce. The spicy sauce was way too spicy. My co-workers were tearing and sweating.  I tried both the hibiscus limeade and the mint limeade. I like the mint limeade the most. It's refreshing. I will try the salads and bowls next."

The meat fillings on both Hawawshi were really good with nice blend of spices that packed really good flavors.Unfortunately, they were way too over seasoned. They were way too salty to the point where it was BITTER and overpowering other spice blends. Very unfortunate because fries were great and both Hawawshi could also have been so much better had there been less salt."

You order from a large touch screen and pick your good up at the counter.They do a lot of take out - it's mostly 'bowl' formulas but there's a few seating areas inside that are a mix of counter stools and tables.Service is swift, or normally is, the third time we visited I think they misplaced opt order because it took about 15 minutes and only arrived after I chased it up. The food the first two times was very flavorful and enjoyable, the third time everything was very bland. I'll put this down to them having an off day/staffing issues and will come back to give them another try as the first two meals were so enjoyable. I recommend any of the bowls, the meatballs are tasty and the falafel one is great too. The Dukka  fries are excellent and I like the condiments they have here too. The portions are generous, and the prices are great especially considering you are in SoHo."

The decor is very colorful and interesting with different merch and pantry items in the back.I got the spicy hawawshi burger and the total was $10.34. I was blown away by the flavors, and it wasn't too spicy. The beef patty was juicy, and the orange-carrot slaw balanced out the flavorful tahina and harissa-raisin sauce. I loved the bread too; it was super soft.This is an amazing quick-bite spot that feels unknown near Soho, I'm definitely recommending this spot to my friends."

Spicy Hawawshi ($11) - this is a pretty large burger, but it did get really soggy on me quite fast so I ended up having to fork-and-knife it. The bread is on the tougher side, but the slaw and sauce helps to soften it up. It wasn't particularly spicy, but the harissa tasted great.

This restaurant took the opportunity to take advantage of the CoronaVirus situation and not only raise their prices, BUT add a $4.00 service and HIDE that fact until AFTER the order had been placed.

The menu offered a wide range of options, and I decided to try the duck, lobster with squid ink linguine, oysters, and pâté en croute.The duck was cooked to perfection, with crispy skin and a juicy interior. The accompanying sauce was a perfect complement to the dish, adding a rich depth of flavor. The lobster with squid ink linguine was equally impressive, with the pasta cooked al dente and the lobster perfectly tender. The use of squid ink added an unexpected but delicious touch to the dish.The oysters were some of the freshest I've ever had, and the pâté en croute was a delightful surprise. The pâté was smooth and flavorful, encased in a flaky crust that added a satisfying crunch.The service at Gotham Restaurant was impeccable, with the staff being knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. The ambiance was also noteworthy, with elegant decor and a cozy atmosphere that made for a truly enjoyable dining experience.Overall, I highly recommend Gotham Restaurant for anyone looking for a top-notch dining experience in New York. The combination of delicious food, fantastic service, and a great atmosphere makes it a must-visit."

Interesting that the same font and name appear on both my gift card and the bill we received.We spoke to the manager twice who was unmoved by our dismay and insisted that the restaurant was a new entity.So they want the old reputation, reviews, font, and name to be the same, but not honor any old agreements or gift cards!

745,_gzXNKarTxagBp6_PkmQKw,1/19/2023,4 star rating,"The good and the bad about places like Gotham is that they've been here for so long they too often rest on their laurels and feel customers should worker harder to sample their culinary creations and pay the up-price more than they should make the effort to work hard to justify and earn the prices they charge.We are not adverse ever to paying for good food. But, when you have to wait forever and a day for the meal to come out, especially at a place as seasoned and as high end as Gotham, it makes you pause and wonder if they need to do a bit of a stop and do a temperature check (pun intended.)Food is consistently good, just slow to get there.Service is consistently good, just be prepared to pay extra for the attitude that often accompanies it.But ... it is Gotham and that's a good thing too."

While the bartender did his very best it still ended up being a disappointment because the kitchen was so incredibly slow that it took over an hour for my second course to arrive (this was pate, not something complicated!). He and the other gentlemen behind the bar were very apologetic and kept grouping together in a threesome to discuss how long my food was taking - at one point exclaiming to me, ""this is insane!"".I left hungry because I couldn't chance waiting another hour for the rest.The bartender comped my drinks, which at least was some consolation.

By the time I post this review, post COVID times, a new talent emerges as Executive Chef: Ron Paprocki.  Of course the hospitality was on point: lovely greeting, offering to take our coats, and seated immediately on arrival. Red Carpet treatment for sure!Reminiscing at our time there, where the restaurant looked quite sophisticated, it was also intimate at the same time.  The atmosphere was still, and sure, whereas the staff seemed to be a little stiff our, dining experience did not waiver!  We decided to go with the 3-course tasting menu, and even though you order the appetizer, the entree, and the dessert; the restaurant gives you several amuse-bouches to tease your senses.  I loved their little take on a mushroom soup.  There was also a little wonton crisp with a citrus-like flavor, smoked salmon with creme fraiche, as well as a lemon sorbet with fruit cubes.  The fresh-baked foccacia were great with the easily melted butter topped with sea salt.  For the appetizer, I had the fish tartare with yuzu vinaigrette. The delicately cut raw fish were tender and truly showcased it's natural flavor without being overpowered by the accompaniment.  When you taste all of the ingredients together, it all melded beautifully. Next up was a wonderful Berkshire Pork Belly; and while the portion was a bit small, the flavor was BIG! Cooked perfection, not overly braised, and very tender. The jus and the seasoning was right on the money.  For the dessert, I had the winter parfait which had the right amount of sweetness and creaminess. Every dish was beautifully presented, and more importantly, tasted great. The combination of service, food, and ambiance, the experience was well worth a 5 stars review."

Because I just grab a coffee when I'm in the area I go to the public space nearby to enjoy my coffee. When I need to sit outside that means I can only shop here when the weather allows.

Here is the food rundown.  Got the frisee salad.  Very good.  Shrimp cocktail was ok.  My daughter got the tuna entree. I tasted it.  It was good.  The children parmesan was a special.  It was very good.  The steak frites was a miss.  Probably should have gotten the porterhouse.  Overall a nice place.  I would go back.  Unfortunately there were a couple of misses as far as the food goes.  Prices were fair

I come into the Knickerbocker around once a week to talk to my friends in a comfortable atmostphere that is inclusive to everyone-the wine by the glass and cocktails are well priced and no problem if you just want dessert or an appetizer. Friendly and professional service. I just wish they would bring back lunch!
816,wejLjvNQxkVfV4OGgMXgog,5/6/2022,5 star rating,"On a par with many of the city's fine steak houses but in a much more casual atmosphere and a lot less pricey as a TBone for two at $100 is what passes for less pricey these days.Taste wise everything was fine.  In addition to the above T Bone, we also had a shell steak and a filet mignon.  All were cooked to perfection.  The salads (Caesar and wedge) and the sides (mushrooms and spinach) were also steak house worthy.  Even the alcohol prices seemed reasonable for Manhattan.  Definitely worthy of a return trip."

I will go back, but just for the bar."

I wanted and sandwich and they were still there and still great."

Everyone is so friendly and polite.  I went there for a chef salad and what I call their special salad dressing is so delicious.  I have been back on more than one occasion.  Not to mention, there fried bologna, cheese, and egg on the roll yummy!  Oh my gosh, the bacon cheeseburger deluxe with the crispy fries...finger licking good!  I had my co-worker purchase one when she left from work on her way home and the next day, she told me how delicious it was.  My other co-worker always gets the zombie sandwich and just recently tried the gunna.  This is the BEST DELI IN WASHINGTON HEIGHTS"

If you're in the area, it is totally worth the visit. Portions are quite large and one sandwich can sometimes be two people. Go for the Hot Mess or Cuzco."
826,qwUPVBeV6oLdiCKHQvru5w,1/22/2023,1 star rating,Racism and assault at tasty deli! DO NOT GO HERE! RACIST EMPLOYEES ASSAULTED HOMELESS MAN AND CALLED HIM THE N WORD REPEATEDLY. I was walking in front of tasty deli and the men who work here were assaulting a homeless man and calling him the N WORD. Completely unacceptable. The community needs to be aware of this. For Yelp: if they try to get this taken down I have photo and video of what happened. It is very important that people in the neighborhood know this is NOT a safe space to enter.
827,qwUPVBeV6oLdiCKHQvru5w,8/26/2022,4 star rating,"When in Washington Heights, there's a deli on every corner, but Tasty Deli really stood out and lived up to its hype! The employees are lively, the sandwiches are so flavorful, and the prices are pretty decent. Definitely ask for what they recommend because all my friends were VERY satisfied with their orders.I ordered the Rico Suave sandwich which had chicken, grilled zucchini, mushrooms, cucumbers, mozzarella, and a bomb chipotle sauce. The sandwich itself was MASSIVE and could probably serve as 2 meals. The combo of flavors was unmatched and it still had a little kick of spice with the sauce. Would definitely get again!We also ordered one BB Lover sandwich with brisket beef, cheese, BBQ sauce, bacon, and grilled onions. The meat was overflowing so you definitely get what you pay for and the sauce was smoky and rich. The sauce to roast beef ratio might have been a little off because you can taste the two more separately than together, but overall it was a banging sandwich. Just might have to become a regular here:)"

I've only been twice so my opinion could change over time but so far, it's been great.They have a pretty extensive menu of sandwiches. The most recent visit, I got the Zombie sandwich which includes lemon seasoned chicken, parmesan cheese, pesto, and marinara sauce - it was delicious and could easily be 2 meals. It seems like their sandwiches are rather large and they have a good selection of wraps as well. Will visit again to try more sandwiches!"

832,u4VGf3gIEtNx6_35cilQLA,2/5/2023,5 star rating,Small location but same great tasting treats. Right on Metropolitan between other shops so it's easy to miss. I got a birthday cake here and it was incredible. Their birthday cake truffles made me tear up which sounds like an exaggeration but I'm not joking I love them so much
833,u4VGf3gIEtNx6_35cilQLA,3/13/2023,3 star rating,I ordered the pie slice and it was pretty tasty - like butter and brown sugar flavor with a gooey texture.I was excited to try Milk Bar for the first time but the experience was a little odd. The woman working was on a phone call and I felt I was interrupting her conversation. The price is pretty high for the small size/experience but it's a popular name so that factors in a bit.

I was searching for a spot that doesn't close when the clock strikes 9 or 10pm. I really wanted the strawberry shortcake cake truffles, but it's seasonal so couldn't get it. The new seasonal truffle that will come out so they said to wait for that one. However, I did get the make your own or build your own pint. Really cool what goes in it! It was tasty! I don't think you can go wrong with what goes in your own ice cream pint. I will definitely go back and make it again."
836,u4VGf3gIEtNx6_35cilQLA,1/17/2022,5 star rating,Cake was ordered in November for a set birthday in January.  Cake arrived on time packed with reusable gel ice packs.   It was wrapped and sealed nicely to preserve its shape.  Cake tasted fresh and was a great surprise to have on a special occasion.
837,u4VGf3gIEtNx6_35cilQLA,8/26/2022,2 star rating,"Unfortunately, my most recent Milk Bar Williamsburg experience wasn't as good as my past visits. The birthday cake slice, which I was excited for, didn't taste fresh. The cake was not not moist and the icing was a bit harder than I remember, which was disappointing. Maybe I came on an off day and got an older cake? For $11 a slice, however, I was expecting more. Staff was friendly."
838,u4VGf3gIEtNx6_35cilQLA,11/24/2021,3 star rating,"3.5 stars.I've actually never had Milk Bar cakes before and have always wanted to try them. I got a slice of their classic birthday cake as well as a slice of the chocolate birthday cake. Honestly, I think it's overhyped. Both were too sweet and the cakes itself weren't very moist (although it wasn't necessarily dry either). The cakes were very crumbly and the frosting was definitely on the sweeter side, which I was already anticipating. The birthday cake slice had small pieces of crunchy crumbs that I actually thought was a bit too much. The chocolate cake had chocolate chips within the cake and had the same frosting. Definitely need to try yourself to judge the flavors and I'm glad I got to try it but be prepared for some sweet cakes. They also have cookies, ice cream and other popular items that I've tried and enjoyed in the past but definitely on the sweeter side."

My Favorite pho of this place is The Mama Pho because the dish has Ribeye, Beef Meatball, Tripe, Beef Shin, Marrow. I don't mind the Rib Eye packaged for take-out Pho's is served raw and the broth must be re-heated to 212F or above in order to cook the raw meat. But the potion of tripe and vegetable seems to be less and less overtime. Shrimp summer roll is just umm....., too much noodle inside and I'm not crazy about the sauce. I always have to make my own hoisin sauce, but I can't complain. In the day I'm lazy to cook, as long as the taste is not too bad I'm okay."

But, today I ordered the Mama Pho which comes with beef balls, tripe, beef shin, marrow, and ribeye. What I received was just ribeye and the noodles. The beef shin is in the soup.

873,Jh6wMPv4IK9jUpWMGj4J9g,1/4/2023,3 star rating,"I'm a fan of Pho and I love Vietnamese food so much. I'm glad there are Mama pho at least 3 locations nearby and this location is the closest. My Favorite pho of this place is The Mama Pho because the dish has Ribeye, Beef Meatball, Tripe, Beef Shin, Marrow. I don't mind the Rib Eye packaged for take-out Pho's is served raw and the broth must be re-heated to 212F or above in order to cook the raw meat. But the potion of tripe and vegetable seems to be less and less overtime. Shrimp summer roll is just umm....., too much noodle inside and I'm not crazy about the sauce. I always have to make my own hoisin sauce, but I can't complain. In the day I'm lazy to cook, as long as the taste is not too bad I'm okay."
874,Jh6wMPv4IK9jUpWMGj4J9g,11/7/2022,2 star rating,"Unfortunately their quality has really taken a turn for the worst. My boyfriend and I have been loyal customers for the past year and sometimes we'd even order twice a week! The portion has dramatically changed since we first discovered this place. For the past couple of months, we've noticed the portion changes but stuck with it anyway because their broth does something to my soul. But, today I ordered the Mama Pho which comes with beef balls, tripe, beef shin, marrow, and ribeye. What I received was just ribeye and the noodles. The beef shin is in the soup. Also it seems the noodle portion is getting smaller while the bean sprout portion is growing. A bit disappointed as this really used to be our favorite place."

876,Jh6wMPv4IK9jUpWMGj4J9g,1/6/2023,5 star rating,"My goodness, where to start?Hands down, this is the best pho I've had in NY. I've tried Nha Trang One in Chinatown and Mama Pho blows this place outta the water. The broth is SUPER flavorful and beefy. You know it's good when you save the broth for later and the fat becomes super solid. They give plenty of meat. Meat to noodle ratio is on point. Even the meatballs are to die for. The best thing? It's open 24/7. If you're looking for pho, this place should be your #1 pick."
877,Jh6wMPv4IK9jUpWMGj4J9g,1/1/2023,1 star rating,This is not Vietnamese food. So bland. Got a lemongrass chicken banh mi and it hardly had any flavor and very little chicken. What it did have was a sharp piece of bone that nearly cracked my tooth.The summer rolls were filled with raw (not pickled) thick stalks of carrot and cucumber. Very bland and hard to eat
878,Jh6wMPv4IK9jUpWMGj4J9g,8/18/2022,3 star rating,I came here on a week night by myself - was pleasantly empty. It was pretty clear the place was more focused on the online orders than in room dining. Many of the tables had half eaten plates from previous diners that weren't cleaned until I asked. The food was great but the ambiance was a little sad.
879,Jh6wMPv4IK9jUpWMGj4J9g,2/11/2023,2 star rating,"Good for late night pho cravings, but honestly overpriced & very very skimpy with the meat. Paid like $15 for pho that came with 4 pieces of meat. All broth and noodles it's boring inside no music playing, just one person working. Not very welcoming or helpful at all."
880,Jh6wMPv4IK9jUpWMGj4J9g,1/6/2023,5 star rating,"This review is for take out: I've had this pho 3 times so far - quality is consistent each time. Their broth is one of the best I've had here in New York, and it's clear they take pride in the taste and quality. The portion of meat is also generous. Overall, the pho makes me nostalgic of pho from my home state of California - which says a lot!"
881,Jh6wMPv4IK9jUpWMGj4J9g,9/8/2021,3 star rating,"One of they few Pho restaurants in Williamsburg. Avoid dining in because you'll get the same experience if you took the food to go. They are operating as a take out place, so your experience will not differ.The broth was flavorful, the noodles were of perfect consistency, and the meat was not overdone. The only issue I had was the portion size. The food was gone in two bites, so the value isn't there. You might need two order two or three portions to call it a meal. Might come back when they up their portions."

Shazammed his stuff all afternoon. Great drinks, great vibes, bar snacks and tons of games if like us you find it impossible to leave. Again, his taste in music was next level. Thanks man! You made a rainy winter afternoon the most fun."
883,ND97mueQmRiUKiN3HZ4vcA,1/7/2023,4 star rating,Oooh this place is definitely a vibe after dark!! I went there to meet a friend for some drinks and ended up chatting the night away. During that time the disco lights came on! The drinks were great. There were cold and hot options which we enjoyed especially the apple cider with bourbon. The pretzel and french fries were enjoyable. The wings were okay but tasted as though they had been sitting out before coming to us. However the wait staff was very gracious to help us resolve the issue.All in all- a nice go to spot in the neighborhood. I'll be sure to take advantage again.

I grabbed a quick drink with a friend here. They have happy hour daily from 3pm-7pm (including weekends). I got the spicy pomegranate margarita, and my friend got the hot toddy (both winter.specials). I loved my cocktail. Great presentation and taste. My friend liked their hot toddy, but I think it could have had a more interesting presentation (no cinnamon stick, might have been cool in a glass mug).I'll definitely be back!"
885,ND97mueQmRiUKiN3HZ4vcA,1/9/2023,5 star rating,LOVE this place. It's very cute and such a lovely happy hour spot. I've now been a few times. It's a great spot to bring friends too because they have a collection of board and card games in the back! The bartender was also great 10/10 service and drinks!!

887,ND97mueQmRiUKiN3HZ4vcA,5/21/2022,5 star rating,"I LOVE The Barlow! The Barlow is kind of like my Cheers except that I've never seen Cheers and I don't think the bartenders know my name. Otherwise, yeah, I think it's like my Cheers. I am here almost weekly - whether we're celebrating a long day being over, a new job, or friends in town, there's always a reason to come. Their drinks are always exceptional. Though I often opt for the frozen drinks (the frozen machines are back ON, people!), they also have fun regular specials (I once had a sriracha margarita, which was exactly what it sounds like). More recently, my friends and I have also made it a mission to try everything on their food menu. Everything is good, but their hot dog, in my opinion, is the ultimate stand out. Other regularly ordered items for our group include their grilled cheese (+ bacon), wings, and chips and salsa. One thing to note is that The Barlow does get quite crowded, especially on the weekends. Still, people here are kind and cool. Nobody is ever hoarding a ton of chairs, and the staff is always helpful if you need to grab an extra seat for someone. I've sat in every part of this place (at the bar, outside along the side of the restaurant, outside at the front umbrella tables, in their more ""sofa-y"" chairs, in the dim ""dining room"" area) and every seating option has its charms. I most often like to sit out front, because there are always tons of cute dogs to hang out with. Despite them being more and more crowded every time I come in, their quality of service never diminishes. Definitely recommend, especially if you're a Crown Heights/Prospects Heights local!"
888,ND97mueQmRiUKiN3HZ4vcA,3/28/2022,4 star rating,If you're in for a calm location to have a drink this is the place to be. It's a very lovely and cozy decor that I loved as I walked in. you can pick anywhere you'd like to sit if there's seats available but I prefer the bar. The staff is very friendly and know very well how to make a drink. I've been here 3x and they've never let me down. They offer tiny bites if you have a appetite but this isn't a place to have a full meal because it's mainly a bar. I will definitely be back.
889,ND97mueQmRiUKiN3HZ4vcA,3/24/2022,5 star rating,"Love this place! Always bring my friends and family here whenever they're in town. The grilled cheese, soft pretzels and the hotdogs are amazing! A neighborhood staple that I highly recommend."
890,ND97mueQmRiUKiN3HZ4vcA,8/6/2021,4 star rating,I'd rate the Barlow four and a half stars.Nice location at an oversized corner offering plenty of outdoor seating. They got a great selection of craft beers on tap including lots of local options. They got a decent selection of whiskeys and cocktails. They seemed a little understated with a bartender and one front of the house attendant. They two guys were hustling which I appreciated. They've got a couple gender neutral restrooms. They also have a kitchen serving up plenty of bar classics.
891,ND97mueQmRiUKiN3HZ4vcA,3/20/2022,5 star rating,"I would give this bar more than 5 stars if I can - great vibes, happy hour and value. Very beautiful interiors and great selection of cocktails. Great date night spot"

Wait staff are all nice, listened when we asked for things to be less salty, and asked if we needed his assistance in taking a family picture too heh.Ginger & Scallion Lobster Yi Mein: we originally order two lobsters, then the waiter asked if we wanted to add the noodles as it would be only $10 more. Best decision ever! Their lobsters are big and meaty so there were many pieces to go around for five people, plus the yi mein at the bottom of the dish was seriously so flavorful and delicious. We still think about that dish often and want to go back (it's been about 1.5 months). A classic dish done very, very right. Clams in Black Bean Sauce: flavorful bean sauce! Everyone loved the sauce and kept adding it to the fish dish that we also ordered. For the most part, the clams were pretty big but there were definitely some baby ones. Second favorite dish though!Deep Fried Fish with Sauce: I forgot what this dish/fish was, but it was a huge chunk of fish that had been deep fried, served on a hot plate, then sizzled when the peppery sauce was poured on top. I actually really liked this as well, but I don't think my family was expecting it to be fried, so they didn't enjoy the texture of the fish as much. I'd say a pretty juicy fish though!Beef Stew Bean Curd Casserole: the tendon wasn't very tender, but the beef definitely wasGarlic Pea Shoots: super garlicky, sooo good, but I do think this one was on the oily side"

896,3TMP2pncE-0LwoDukbaqlg,2/22/2022,5 star rating,"Classic HK Style family dining without the fancy restaurant prices. While many joints in Chinatown are very economical, this one does it with a wide variety of fare and the decor is inviting. This place has had a few face lifts, name changes and have been ever-changing since I've been frequenting it as a kid to adulthood but one thing that's been consistent is the good food. Something about this address I guess. Maybe the chefs in the back are the same?! I kid, I kid.With so many options in Chinatown, this one checks all the boxes. Menus are in both English and Chinese. Seasonal specials posted on the wall. TV in the main dining area. Tables of all sizes to accommodate the small to larger groups. Best part, the menu options! There truly is a dish for everyone... My family is the exact example of that. Lots of veggie dishes and tofu options. Proteins: beef, pork, chicken, fish and seafood. Covers it all. If you can't find what you want, they can possibly make it - just ask. I was even able to order my kiddos favorite, tomatoes and eggs. Simple yes, but believe it or not, not many places make it and so tasty. You laugh but we're happy campers here. Eat family style or individual plates. I totally recommend the eggplant. This is a great go to for dinner to go if you're not wanting to dine in."

My favorite was the fried fish filet with corn and the sautéed garlic bok choy (not on the menu, but was on the mirrors as a feature). The price was well worth it for a lunch special (10.99 a dish), tho I was surprised they charged for rice. The wait staff was very pleasant and nice, however, they were SO busy bustling around - everything was ""go go go"". They had as many take outs as they did diners, and the turnover was quick. The decor with the vintage photos of HK was so fun to look at too. Totally would recommend!"

After you order a bunch of bagels they throw them all in the bag with the condiments on the bottom so it's not like they're actually buttering the bagels for you.  They don't separate the bagels either - all the flavors mixing together in the bottom of the bag.  At least use a sleeve / divider / bagel bag. Why in the world would it take 15 to 20 minutes to place bagels into a bag?  It doesn't make sense to take a 15-second order and mix it in to the queue with hot food - they should be a separate bagel and pastry person.

906,4ybYFlOeJdTyziaFkuc5Fw,2/10/2023,1 star rating,This location is a train wreck ever since they started the sip club. The milk for coffee isn't labeled correctly....there was almond milk in the container labeled half and half. So many times they run out of coffee or even sugar. The owner needs to get their act together. The workers there just don't give a crap about customers. The Panera in Williston park/mineola is so much better than this location and the LN location should definitely take notes and learn from them. I'm driving an extra half hour to the other locations even though LN location is just down the block from me.

But the experience at the chipotle at 200 Varick Street was BY FAR the worst chipotle I've ever been to. The staff was rude and welcoming. When we got inside i can see that in the back of the prep area, not the line but in the back an employee was eating food... I'm pretty sure that's a health violation. When we ordered it seemed like we were being pests to the employees. When we sat down, we noticed that the white rice was uncooked and inedible. I never ask for receipts but i felt the need to ask because i feel it was necessary to write a review. As we're eating we overhear your manager in the back of the store that we're ""bodying (slang word for enjoying the food) of the food"" so we said something to the manager and he came over. We told him about the rice and he told us that ""4 other people complained about the rice."" And when we asked him why he was still serving the rice, he had no response. We told him about the unwelcoming staff and we felt that the manager did not even care about our feedback. Later on, in the back, we overhear a female employee saying ""fuck them, i don't give a fuck about that bitch"".   And the manager didn't reprimand his employee about making that comment. Later on, the manager was being really sarcastic about our comments and mocking us saying ""smile, guys. Be nice to costumers.""When more guests come in, we tried to warn them about not eating the rice and they tried kicking us out. Overall very disappointed in our experience."

I have only been there during the pandemic so I can really only speak to the actual coffee itself and the nice service...oh and the LOCATION! This spot is the perfect place for your ""coffee & a walk"" dates/hangouts. This cozy spot is located just a block away from Washington Square Park. It is also located by a bunch of great food in the NYU area. So it's a great spot to grab a little pick-me-up after enjoying lunch at a nearby spot!I tried the Mocha here and I have to say I was pretty impressed! It wasn't overpowering in sweetness, they used a single-origin cocoa, the milk was the perfect temperature (not too hot!). I feel like burnt espresso taste and over-steamed milk is far too common in cafes, but this place knows what they're doing! I truly enjoyed this beverage, zero complaints! I will definitely be making this a spot to stop by next time I'm in that part of the city!"
933,rd0VGG_d_qNp_aBW_HJM4w,6/25/2022,5 star rating,The definition of a great hole-in-the-wall coffee shop. Would highly recommend if you're going to grab and go. I got the mocha here and it was substantially better than most mochas I've had - it had the right amount of sweetness and a noticeable but not overbearing chocolate note.
934,rd0VGG_d_qNp_aBW_HJM4w,7/3/2021,4 star rating,Got the mocha and it was pretty good. Not as much caffeine as I would've liked. I'd go back if I was in the area. Would probably get cold brew next time

Has a hint of chocolate and not sweet at all.This isn't really a place where you work from since the tables are so tiny and there aren't any outlets. It's perfect for catching up with a friend or just grabbing a quick to-go coffee!"
937,rd0VGG_d_qNp_aBW_HJM4w,3/3/2021,4 star rating,"I wonder if it's due to COVID, but their store really has turned itself into a hole-in-the-wall where it's literally just a counter you can order from. There are 2 tiny tables with few chairs in front if you want to sit. It's actually not bad if the weather allows. I ordered Latte with Almond Milk and despite of serving it in paper cups with lid, they still create the typical heart latte art. Much appreciated. The latte was really good! I feel like the coffee was not too strong, which is great to have after lunch time so you don't have to worry if it will disturb your sleep hygiene. Service was quick and nice. There might be a lot of places with cheaper coffee than here, but for the taste I think it's reasonable"

A friend of mine who appreciates fine coffee invited me here and I'm glad he did.Third Rail is small, and the offerings are limited. Yet this works perfectly for Third Rail as they make exceptionally good iced brew coffee and some mighty delicious looking pastries. I enjoyed the bold, deep, rich flavors Third Rails Iced brew delivered. Genuine flavors of a fine roasted coffee, not simply a bean that has been burnt beyond recognition and called ""coffee"". The inside is small but we got a small table to enjoy our beverages. The ambiance is pleasant, a balance of people working/studying and those of us small groups of friends that just were enjoying a damn good cup of coffee. I traveled about and hour in both directions just to taste this coffee and it was well worth it. I highly recommend a visit. Or two, or more....... Enjoy!"

But lately There's a Barista that can't get it right. Even after I told them it still came out awful - I should have just gotten 1 instead of 3!!He runs machine too long and adds too much milk or something else. Bad.The women that work there have never disappointed, so I will not get coffee there until I see who's Barista that day or this fellow can prove he got it right."

(One of each) and a margarita. I wish they were bigger or at least a bit less expensive. I felt they were small and I felt like it was expensive for 3 very small tacos and a drink. The place is nice and I did not see a bathroom/restroom. In addition, It's by the pier, and they have a beautiful park for kids right beside it. It's a nice place to go and spend the evening. We had fun!"
943,eCD1l-Xx3QqnhrSsoccgMg,10/18/2022,3 star rating,"Was here with one other person after walking through Domino Park and a few other spots. They have a steady business thanks to the number of people visiting the park and the nice views so they could get away with terrible tacos but they actually had alright ones. The chicken tinga was a little bit bland even with their hot sauce but the al pastor had pretty nice flavor though the pork was perhaps a little bit dry. As another reviewer mentioned, they could definitely add a bit more pineapple but it was fine. Around 4 to 5 bucks per taco which is pricey but hey it's Williamsburg and it's inside a park so it's pretty expected. Also had a agua fresca. I believe it was hibiscus and watermelon and I remember it being refreshing and pretty good being not too sweet. Perfectly alright park food but if it was anywhere outside of this park, I doubt they would stay in business with this price model."

I might visit the location in Brooklyn to see if it is better but at not too sure after this experience. The tortilla was cold, not heated on the griddle which would have helped. For $12 you got two tacos with a little cotija cheese and salsa verde.  The chicken was shredded and had a spicy sauce but it wasn't very flavorful. The sauce quickly made the tortilla very soggy and this happened before I got back to my seat. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this food choice at Citi Field."

Such a great location right by the water, and a great stop on our walk through Williamsburg."

The pork was a little dry but I put some of their hot sauce on it which made it better. I liked the sweetness of the pineapple in the taco. The outdoor seating is colorful and cute. I had fun playing the cornhole that they set up.

A truly wonderful and authentic German restaurant experince that should not be missed.We came at lunchtime on a Sunday afternoon and the place was full! The Hofbrau draft  beer on tap was served cold in a stein and so delicious.The Deutsher salad as a starter was beautifully full of goodness just as I had remembered; the Kaespatzle delectably creamy and comforting! The entrees, Jagerschnitzel with home fries and red cabbage, and the Wiener schnitzel with steak fries and creamed spinach were out of this world. Portions are so generous that we had to half home along with a piece of the Black forest cake.Service was fantastic and the mood was relaxed and welcoming. Be sure to check out their adjacent store filled with all kinds of fresh German meats and salads and other German products."

Although it needs a good dusting.The restaurant is connected to its German pork and grocery store through an inner hallway next to it's bar.Street parking is a bit difficult to find. There are two dining rooms with the one we were in having perhaps 14 tables and 6 booths. There is also another private party space that we did not see.There is a straight bar where patrons get to enjoy watching sports.Service was timely.We had several items:1. Chicken Jaegerschnitzel - great (huge portion)2. Vennerschitzel - - great (large portion)3. German salad - same as you would get at Juniors for free but here it will cost you and without pickles4. German potato pancakes - very crispy but tasty5. Red cabbage - mixed I liked it, my partner - not)6. Spinach - very good7. Black Forest cake made with Schwartzwalder - fantastic8. Bread - mixed (I thought a bit heavy, hard, and lacking taste; my partner thought okayBoth entrees were serviced on a bed of scalloped potatoes - excellent.It seems like they have their regulars who go there frequently to socialize in small groups or couples - mostly seniors (day time).Food came out in reasonable (not fast but acceptable) time.Prices are moderate but portions on entrees are immense so it's like getting two meals in one. I watched every group leave with minimum of at least one carrying a take out leftovers. We both had as well.If you enjoy German food, like a casual atmosphere and haven't stopped dining out due to higher restaurant prices you should give this a try.See my photos for some dishes and menu as of February 2023.Bon Appetite!Carson"

I'd honestly just go here for a loaf of bread and a beer. But no no, i always order something :) I ordered the Huhn Jagerschnitzel - I love that they have a bar portion which is half the size of the regular plate. I still couldn't finish it! Thick juicy piece of breaded chicken with a savory mushroom gravy. Their homefries are also really good. The other item we usually order is the gulash!

I went with red mat for the Jaeger Schnitzel and my friend went with the pork chops.The food is magnificent.  I love Jaeger (veal) Schnitzel and the way it's served with some gravy (rich and full of flavors) and potatoes makes it perfect.  An ultra large portion but I managed to put it all away.  My friend's pork chops were also LARGE and juicy and tasty and he had to take some homeLoved the strudel at the end and went home stuffed.  This was quite the lunch.  I highly recommend that everyone comes here at least once.  But, I'm sure after one try, you'll comeback.  I haven't had this good German food since the Luchows on 14th Street days.KUDOs to the team at Zum Stammtisch"

On the outside as well as the inside, the restaurant resembles a German town (very cute and cozy). I arrived for lunch and watched the World Cup in their outside area, which was fun. I ordered the Munich mule, the pretzel, the veal with mushrooms, and the sausage platter. It all was very very good. The staff was very nice and available, which is nice when seated outside. Also, the restaurant gave us free German scarfs to use as we sat outside that we got to take home. I am going to return one day, as this place was great!"

I like introducing people to this spot because it's literally like time traveling into some small town in Germany. I adore it. The people I take here, I know are gonna love it. My roommate is from the Midwest and literally blew her mind when we went. Just took my friend from Seattle here last night. And she was still raving about it today. The details of this restaurant are truly beautiful. It's always families celebrating some grandparents birthday. Because there's no subway, you rarely bump into the hipsters. It adds to the charm here. Anytime I come, I always feel welcome. Last night our waitress was a doll. She took so many photos for us. She never rushed us and helped us have a great experience. Don't judge our gluttonous order. We had to try the large pretzel. We both loved the sweet mustard and the horseradish cream dip.I then got the spätzle without bacon and the German salads. The salad has beets, carrots and cucumbers. The spätzle was cheesy perfection. My friend got pork chops! They were gigantic!!! She fell in love with the restaurant last night. Our pilsners were a nice light comparison to our decadent food. Even though the restaurant was almost closing, we were still offered dessert but we were busting at the seams. Our waitress said her hot tip is to order dessert first! Ha! Next time. Prost!"

Few minutes later she called back and asked if I still wanted the food and she would make it at that moment.

I don't eat pork and no one in my house does either so they're getting tossed out. I'll never order from them again, I suggest you don't either. I used the packets and my hand to show how tiny the wings are. The only thing decent was the veggie fried rice but even that needed a little chili oil on it. This was 25$ including tip."

We ordered Chilaquiles, Yucca Fries and the beef and chicken tacos. The chilaquiles were done very well with chihuahua cheese and the mexican crema tasted very fresh! My friend enjoyed her tacos and claims they stood up to what she ate when she lived in mexico city. While not on the bottomless menu, we had to try their take on an espresso martini -the 24/7 which had a smokey vibe because it was made with tequila. It was AMaZInG. Def worth a shot!

But if you're looking for authentic and bold flavored this isn't that. They do have a good variety of flavors for their tacos and I enjoyed the fried fish one the most.

Fish Taco - This was average, I wouldn't order it again because I didn't like the sauce. The fish was battered perfectly though.

And my boyfriend's burrito was also cold, but worse he said the pork tasted old. And before you say it was a delivery issue, I picked it up almost immediately.

They don't serve food but they'll allow you to bring your food inside, just clean up after yourself. The outdoor patio is super cute and during the summer, it's always busy and fun."

My bf and I stopped inside for a drink on a Saturday night and had a great time.Dark, speakeasy and chill vibes inside with the game playing in the background. It was actually very cool inside and big with a decent amount of seating. Only one bartender working and he was generous with the liquor in every drink he made. Good vibes and a place I'd hit up again if I were in the area!"

985,6ByP77RSnZRZyLfAZOaWHQ,5/23/2021,3 star rating,"Went for a quick drink at The Gate on Friday evening. A pretty standard dive bar with a nice selection of beer and in a good location for people watching.Quality: The Gate is a typical dive beer bar. They have a constant rotation of beers on tap, showcasing both local favorites and some unique beers from across the country. They also have a few old world beers, and I assume they always keep Guinness on the menu. If none of the draft beers catch your eye they also have forty or so can options as well as a couple of cocktails. During our visit I ordered a Brooklyn Cider Bone Dry and a Firestone Walker Velvet Merlin nitro milk stout. Nice pours and served at a good temperature. I also always love to see some emphasis placed on nitro beers. Quantity: Standard draft pours for beers, unless noted on the menu.Value: $5-$9 for Draught Ales & Lagers. The bar is cash only.Ambiance: The Gate is located on the corner of 5th Avenue and 3rd Street in Park Slope. Across the street from a busy park, it has a ton of foot traffic every night of the week. They are not currently allowing guests to drink inside. The darkened interior is currently an emptied out room, where you just order and grab your beer. It isn't too problematic because they always had a large fenced in patio area, and now have spread additional tables onto the sidewalks surrounding the building. Classic rock music played inside, but outside it was frequently overwhelmed from the noise of the sidewalk and street.Crowd: This bar is always busy with nice weather, and this Friday was no different. It is in the middle of the action, so it is a great place to sit back with a beer and watch the chaos of the neighborhood.Service: They currently have QR codes with the menu on each table, but you go inside the bar to order. The bartenders were friendly and efficient, keeping things moving and preventing guests from congregating inside.Parking: A fair amount of street parking in the area."

We were a  party of 4-5ppl sitting outside on a Saturday afternoon. That's when 5th avenue is pedestrian only. We had a few rounds of beers. When we left someone in our party left an unfinished banana on the table. The guy who was cleaning tables threw that banana  at me. I was stunned. When I approached him to ask  what his issue was his sentiment was: ""I am not gonna clean your garbage!""  Whatever the motivation behind this ridiculous act may be I will try to avoid this place at all costs. The bartender was jerk as well despite us leaving hefty tips. There are much better spots in the area with much better staff and selection."

They offer such a wide variety of smoothies, teas, coffees, boba, rolled ice cream, vitamin/mineral supplements, açaí products, and more! As of early February 2022, there is only about 2 areas near the window for indoor seating, as their back seating is closed due to COVID, but most people seem to drop in to grab their drinks and dessert to go.We got the thai bubble tea and chocolate rolled ice cream. The thai bubble tea was really nice at 30% sugar, and there wasn't an overwhelming amount of ice in the drink (which I love!) The boba pearls were cooked a little too long for my taste, but nothing too bad.The rolled ice cream...I know it's not the prettiest, but this might have been some of the best ice cream I've had. So so so creamy and rich, and was not melty am even after 10 minutes or so. The chocolate flavor came with oreo smashed in pretty well, some pocky sticks, whipped cream, and you are allowed THREE additional toppings (most options are chopped fresh fruit.)As their menu is so extensive and has such unique products you can add in, I would love to come back and try more items off their menu.

I decided to grab a smoothie before heading to work, and I will never be back again.I went in for a watermelon lychee slush. The workers were acting werid with the order, so I went around to see the fruit and figure out if something was wrong. The worker quickly grabbed the blender, added lychee syrup, and started blending. I looked at their fruit and saw no watermelon. I saw two stacks of tomatoes instead. T_T I'm sure you can figure out where this is going.I asked why they would put tomatoes when I asked for watermelon. They told me that's what I asked for. Lol wow. I pointed to the picture and stated it's a slice of watermelon I did not ask for tomatoes. The young worker looked panicked and asked the older woman to come over, as he suddenly did not speak English.The older woman said it's good for you. Have it. I said you can't just put whatever you want without knowing someone has an allergy. She told me to swap it, the fruit looked really old, so I just asked for a refund. She was pissed off.

Prices are fair, not dirt cheap like I expected them to be, but very fair. I like that this place has a central american twist on a lot of the dishes adding chorizo, jalapenos, and rice and beans to a lot of options. While still staying true to New York diner style food like pastrami sandwiches, bacon and eggs, french toast, pancakes, etc. It's an awesome mix.For around $10 a person you can leave this place satisfied and full. The look and feel of the diner is definitely the best part and a lot of that is due to the friendly staff and train car style architecture they've kept in tact over the years.Breakfast combos definitely seem like the way to go here and that's exactly what I did. Pastrami sandwich was average but good. Would definitely make this a regular breakfast spot."

It wasn't even well packed. They should've wrapped the iced coffee in plastic so it wouldn't spill. The Cuban sandwich was awful! One pickle and not even a lot of mustard. Look at the picture for reference. I was really disappointed. Also the food was cold but that might've been the drivers fault for dropping off another order before mine. Wouldn't recommended delivery here

Today we ordered when we saw it on uber eats and it was horrible.  Disgusting.  We got a bacon and egg on a roll, disco fries and the wake up omelet.  All nasty. The food was bland, no flavor. The bacon was fatty and gross. The roll looked like someone stepped on it and the home fries were now raw and had not even a grain of salt on it. Then the disco fries had american cheese on them and had some water gravy that was not good. Disco fries are supposed to be made with mozzarella so idk why they used the nasty synthetic tasting american cheese on them. We were so disappointed. Definitely don't recommend this place AT ALL."

My husband and me walked into with our hungry child we patiently waited for our server to sit us down but instead got seated by the grill cook.we sat down decided was we were about to have we waited about 25min before we got up and walked out! I've worked in the food industry and understand that it can be really overwhelming but to see what we were the only people inside waiting to get served and to still take a really long time to at least ask you what you would like to drink is insane! After we stood up and about to walk out the cashier (girl with glasses) decides to say we have to wait that she's just the cashier while the ""waiter"" is in the back just on her phone!

The first few times, they charged me $16 even than another time $18 and now 17.09 than 17.40 than 17.30. I honestly want to know why is the price ALWAYS changing. And when inquiring why, she replied ""it's only a few cents"" and insulted me by insinuating I was being trouble maker for asking about why am I always being charged a different price on the same exact orders.

Have ordered from newer folks lately and have to remind them that I requested writing on the cake ...(it's on the receipt).One should order at least 2 days in advance esp if you want writing on the cake. Light whip cream is good, however strawberries are seasonal so hit or miss most of the time...they used to use strawberry preserves inside (which I prefer), but now use real strawberries... Cakes are made fresh daily along with bakery items. Have to try some of the other items.Have tried the rolls before - sometimes moist and other times dry.Overall good bakery in Chinatown."

We told the waiter and he said that's how they always serve it? Have never been served such little meat on a philly. Waiter obliged and ordered more cooked meat from the kitchen.-Grilled chicken deluxe: had a nice grilled taste but could have used more chicken. They also could have used a slightly thicker bun so it wouldn't fall apart as the one used was of the lower grade kind carried in a standard supermarket. This was the only okay item we got.-beef sausage: only 2 halves were given, other diners usually serve 3.-french toast: made with standard sliced bread so very light and not your standard thick/challah style bread. Slightly cinnamony but mostly bland. In addition, one of ours had a large piece of eggshell in it. To top it off, the ambience is below average.I feel bad saying it but this is one of the worst places I have been to. Would not recommend."

We told the waiter and he said that's how they always serve it? Have never been served such little meat on a philly.

They also could have used a slightly thicker bun so it wouldn't fall apart as the one used was of the lower grade kind carried in a standard supermarket. This was the only okay item we got.-beef sausage: only 2 halves were given, other diners usually serve 3.-french toast: made with standard sliced bread so very light and not your standard thick/challah style bread.

The Applewood smoked bacon was yummy.  Next time, I'd try the Nori fries, the popcorn chicken, and jalapeño popper eggrolls.The Tokyo Highball is on draft...just ok.

Dunno if I would classify it as that, but it's definitely fun. It has nice decorations that do seem Japanese inspired but with a Western slant. Can get crowded if you don't get there early. No reservations for a party less than 6 so it's all walk ins. The tables are a bit small so very intimate environment.The staff is very helpful. I originally wanted a milkshake but she mentioned it'd be too heavy for a first drink, so I tried one of the highballs. The food is pretty good too. Would recommend the sando!"

We went to another bar and waited for the text.Ordered the Panda Fizz and thought it was really refreshing - Barely tasted of any alcohol so it's definitely dangerous! I also tried the Ichigo Milkshake and didn't like it that much. The literal boozy milkshake just did not do it for me.Overall, I thought Katana Kitten was really cool to check out. FYI, this place plays 80/90s music."
1066,kIzVGUWS2b5H_b-G0Q0-0g,3/7/2023,3 star rating,"3.5 stars! If I had the option, I would sit at the bottom level again. The top level is definitely livelier, and if you're looking for more of a party vibe it may be better for you. Downstairs, it was more intimate where I could actually talk to and hear my husband. We shared:- Hinoki martini ($22): grey goose, spring 44 mountain gin, fino sherry, junmai daiginjo, hinoki tree essence. Beautifully presented in a wooden box, the shape of the glass was also interesting (a cone) sitting in a pile of ice. The drink was STRONG, but if you're into martinis you would probably love it.- Panda fizz ($18): haku vodka, pear, calpico, lemon, pandan, lava salt. Not as much pandan flavor as I would have liked, definitely a refreshing drink.- Ichigo milkshake ($20): remy martin 1738, mount gay rum, l'orgeat almond, fresh strawberry cream, dale's pimento bitters. The favorite of the night. Not too sweet and had a nice flavor."

Luckily, right after we got there, a few people left and me and my date were able to get a seat. The service was great, and the drinks were tasty. We opted out of food due to later reservations nearby, but I would definitely come back to try. By the time we left (9:45) the place was getting full and there were maybe 2-3 parties standing by the bar. Melon lime soda- 3/5 for me. It was okay, but I really wished I could've tasted the matchaPanda fizz- 4/5. This tasted like a fizzy calpico Amaretto sour- 5/5, by far my favorite drink of the night. It wasn't overly sweet like Amaretto drinks can be, but just the right amount."

I've never had mortadella that thick cut before, but it was good. The milk bread was a bit thick, so the overall ratio of the sandwich wasn't for me (I acknowledge this is more my preference).We also got the nori fries. Deliciously salty! Make sure to drink a lot of water. It came with a curry sauce, which was a very different flavor from many fries I've gotten in the past, so I appreciated the more unique take.The karaage calamari was also good, but I've had better elsewhere.Overall, I enjoyed my experience and would return on occasion, I'm not dying to go back."

My group opted to wait at Do Not Fred Alligators nearby.-Nori Fries (4/5): the crinkle cut fries were not too thick and the fries were nice and crisp. the japanese curry sauce was a bit heavy though-Amaretto Sour (5/5): I surprisingly really liked this one. I loved the egg white and the sweetness from the plum-Panda Fizz (5/5): I would liken this drink to Calpico... nice light, refreshing flavor that was really delicious! -Melon-lime Soda (4.5/5): this drink was extremely light and tasted very refreshing-Ichigo Milkshake (1/5): too sweet for me lol. But others really liked it!"

Definitely some of the best drinks I've had - Calpico swizzle is really good and so is the amaretto sour. Great ambiance, but it gets SO busy and kind of loud? Maybe not the best place for small talk. We were lucky to get bar seating, but there were tons of people just standing behind the bar. Be prepared to wait a while if you get there during peak hours. Also I love the panels in their bathroom LOL"
1071,kIzVGUWS2b5H_b-G0Q0-0g,12/15/2022,5 star rating,"The 50 best bar list people know what's up. Katana kitten fully qualifies to be on the list for more than one reason. If you don't have reservations, they accept walk-ins. Which then makes this the second stop on your night out, because the wait is usually pretty long. Long enough for you to get a drink, if not two, at a nearby bar. But I promise you it's worth coming back. My boilermaker drink order that night was not the best choice. I'm going to venture a guess and say it was the ichi-mas. It came highly recommended and was told it was a blend of a beer and a Japanese whiskey, which in theory sounds great, something I'd enjoy on a warm summer night but not exactly what I was looking for at the time of my visit. Nonetheless, the food more than made up for the lackluster drink. The nori fries with Japanese katsu curry is the poutine I didn't know I needed. The fried chicken sando was delicious. The chicken was fried to perfection and got along famously with the aioli slathered bread. The Katana kitten staff are more than just staff, they are like family to each other. It happened to be a staff members birthday when we were there and they actually had a mariachi band come in and show him and us the best time. I will be back here to try the other drinks and most definitely for the nori fries!"

She told the man in another language [pictured] of the mistake after telling me it was a $0.50 up charge - which I was aware of and was fine... however, because he was visibly annoyed that he had to make another 1, told her [in their language] to charge me $1.00 instead, so she changed it. Aware of what he had done [especially bc I order the drink all the time] I told her no and gave her the $0.50. I'm all about principle and if that's how his attitude is going to be because of a mistake, he should not be assisting customers [nor did I feel 100% comfortable with him making my drink.

However be warned of a few things: I say decent sushi, because it's tasty, but definitely not spectacular! If you've been to sugar fish, NoBu etc you will definitely NOT be blown away by any means. However, if you just so happen to be close by & have a serious craving for sushi, this place will definitely hit the spot (: Also, I have never gotten treated badly here, not once. I've come to terms that many restaurants that do PRIMARILY take out orders don't usually have warm & cuddly customer service. Do they have seating? Yes. Is almost always empty @ least when I've come there? Yes. So, all this to say, don't come here for the hugs. Do stay for the sushi & the delicious green tea ice cream! It's a definite must!"

Lesson of the day: A Health grade does not mean the fish is fresh. Sashimi is only a dollar for a reason. Spend a few extra bucks and get it fresher from somewhere else. Also sashimi is supposed to be the best cut of the fish ... if that was the best cut I don't want any of the first at all. And also it was cut was too thick and clumpy. I also tried the yellowtail with jalapeño appetizer as its one of my favorites. You could tell the jalapeño came picked from a jar. This should always be served with a fresh thinly slices jalapeño for optimal pairing. I was highly disappointed."

The vibe of the restaurant feels like a high-end Greek diner, but the menu is certainly Italian. Location is ideally convenient to Penn station, trains, shopping and Madison square garden.We had the pappardelle Bolognese, calamari, and a seafood scampi dish all of which were ideally prepared. We ordered drinks as well, as they have an extensive wine selection. The cost for dinner was less than $50 per person, which was value considering the quality, service and location. The next time we're in the area, will certainly be back."

The staff was the only saving grace here. My veal was maybe an eight inch thick with a terrible butter sauce for the noodles. My spouse got the branzino which looked really good but again was just bland, the appetizer was decent as a basic though well seasoned calamari but the breading was soggy and the marinara flavorless. I asked for cheese on my pasta and I got a very old small plate of already grated cheese as the final nail in the coffin. If this were some throw away meal for 30 bucks a person sure I can stomach the bad food. But for the price and flavor just walk away. As always happy hunting"

It also list the calories, etc.  The salad was $10.99. It is a few bucks cheaper that Chop't. Chop't is also a chain where you can build salads, etc. The price was decent and didn't break bank.

I ordered through ritual during non peak hour so I got the salad right when I arrived.I made some slight customization to the Thai chicken crunch salad. I added some roasted turkey and shaved parm. I also got kale instead of romaine lettuce. Since I ordered the dressing to be mixed in rather than on the side, I couldn't really tell whether they are chicken or the turkey that I paid additionally for. They were cut to pretty small cubes. But almost every bite of veggies I got some protein so I guess they must have added the additional turkey. The veggies overall is fresh. The sauce enhances the taste of the whole salad.

I didn't want to spend $10 for a foot long so got the 6 inch for $6. In most subways I can usually choose the bread. I asked for the whole wheat and the person at the counter said we don't have that and kept on insisting I order the Italian bread. I finally asked is this the only bread that you have and he said yes. Im like why have a list of choices when obviously there are none. I was a bit confused with the menu up on the top part of the wall. The prices were quoted a certain way, but the actual prices were off.

The first time I went this subway was 3 days ago, asked for a $5 foot long and they said they didn't sell them so I had to pay $10 for 1 sandwich and if I wanted any other sandwiches I had to another $10 which was ridiculous. Then I went and got a cup so I could get some fountain soda and I got sprite, I didn't drink it until i got home and when I drank it the soda wasn't sprite it was seltzer. I'm not joking either the second time I went to the subway I made sure to check if it was sprite but it was still seltzer. So I told one of the employees that it wasn't sprite and that it was seltzer and that he had to change it out for sprite and he said that he couldn't do that and than said that's what we got, and when I asked for the pizza sub melt on their secret menu he said we don't sell that here. I don't even know if this subway will be updated like the other subways with better furniture, WIFI, and USB ports, and especially better service because this subway has the most rudest employees ever.I gave this subway 2 changes and both were horrible experiences. 1 Star."

Then I went and got a cup so I could get some fountain soda and I got sprite, I didn't drink it until i got home and when I drank it the soda wasn't sprite it was seltzer. I'm not joking either the second time I went to the subway I made sure to check if it was sprite but it was still seltzer. So I told one of the employees that it wasn't sprite and that it was seltzer and that he had to change it out for sprite and he said that he couldn't do that and than said that's what we got, and when I asked for the pizza sub melt on their secret menu he said we don't sell that here.

I'm not joking either the second time I went to the subway I made sure to check if it was sprite but it was still seltzer.

The bread is hard as stone, the veggie patty is hard as stone, the wrap paper is messy and disgusting. I said if no cookies, cancel this item, they just didn't deliver the cookies, but no refund. Most importantly, I was hungry and didn't want to waste $22 dollars for delivery this shit. I ate it. Then I had a serious stomachache, and had to eat pain relief.

It's a fusion of Mexican tacos and Japanese food. Now I know what you're thinking, but it was seriously the best taco places I've ever had. Plus it's fast and cheap! The pictures don't do it justice! This taco place is a mixture of Japanese food and Mexican. Now I know that sounds weird and not appealing but you're so so wrong. They have very unique tacos, drinks, burritos and bowls! If you're ever in the area, check them out! And get the shrimp tacos"
1282,PqX9bDlDCc6qOZd2vw4tYw,10/3/2022,3 star rating,"Ordering is a little confusing. I wasn't sure if I needed to sit down to order or go to the register to place order then find a seat? So I went to the register and when I got my food it was in take out containers. Sat at the bar regardless, and ordered a few more items which were served in plates and was billed afterward for them. I would recommend this place if you want to try the fusion stuff because their crunchy tacos are the better of the item that are on the menu.  The soft tortilla tacos, personally, were disappointing. Was there from LA and I know our street vendors would give any taco place outside of LA a run for their money. I am spoiled in that regard and biased as well because I know what a good soft tortilla taco should be. Maybe use better quality tortillas to give your soft tacos a little more umph, because at best they're mediocre. The tortilla should not be an afterthought. It is part of what makes a taco great. I tried all except their tofu, veggie, and lentil tacos (no judgment if you liked veggie tacos just not my preference). I liked the crunchy curry beef best only because it is what I expected something fusion to taste like. It was crunchy, the taste was there. Also liked the Chipotle shrimp taco. It reminded me of shrimp tempura but with more taste. Overall a place to try if you are feeling adventurous. I do not think I would go again unless I absolutely wanted to feel the texture and specific flavor mixture of the crunchy tacos. All else was just ok. Try it for yourself for sure if you are there."
1283,PqX9bDlDCc6qOZd2vw4tYw,10/1/2022,2 star rating,"Out of all the food choices in Chelsea Market, we chose this one since it was Japanese-inspired Mexican cuisine.-----Bento Box: choose 2 tacos + 1 side ($13.32).We picked two Japanese Curry Beef tacos and Japanese Rice & Beans as the side. While the taco shell was crispy, it was hard to distinguish a curry flavor and the meat was not that tender. For the side, it tasted primary like Mexican rice and the black beans were still hard. We only ate a couple bites and discarded the rest.Expensive for the portion and quality of the food. A single taco costs $5.05 and a side is $5.51. The box included a side of chips but no dipping sauce.-----The business is located in the block with PIA and Tings. Some of the customers sitting at the bar counter had the food served on actual plates instead of takeout containers. Perhaps it needs to be specified when placing the order at the register. Prices are as-is. Wi-Fi is available via the market."

It was a snap decision while visiting the Chelsea Market and Food Hall, and we all wished we had done something else.We were seduced by the thought of Mexican and Japanese fusion. Two particularly flavorful cuisines that we all happen to enjoy. The menu sounded great, and we decided to go for it, without checking Yelp. Mistakes were made.We ordered one of every taco on the menu in the form of bento boxes with the exception of the tofu based one. The two best were the curry beef and the shrimp taco. The rest were decisively bland, as were the ""gyoza"" taco shells that we were overly excited about. The blandest item of all though was the burrito one of our party ordered. The chipotle chicken inside literally had zero flavor. All the other fillings like the beans and rice, also flavorless. Not even the Hot sauce we asked for could save it. It was mostly wasted.Very disappointed. Those two cuisines are two of the least bland on the planet. No idea how they came together to produce this letdown... But they did. Whomp whomp."
1289,PqX9bDlDCc6qOZd2vw4tYw,7/6/2022,3 star rating,"Stopped by here on a day trip to the city. I was curious about the Japanese Mexican fusion concept but was a bit let down. It seemed like two cuisines existing separately on the menu rather than a melding of both. Bento Box- You get two tacos and a side. I got the spicy tuna taco, carnitas taco, and the takumi slaw. I enjoyed the spicy tuna taco wonton shell but there was barely any tuna in the taco itself. It was filled with veggies instead. The carnitas were soft and the tomatillo sauce was flavorful, but the tortilla didn't taste homemade. The slaw is actually a side salad. Loved the sesame dressing but felt a bit misled by the description. The chips were really a bummer. They weren't crunchy and tasted a bit stale.All in all disappointed with the place. To top it off when I asked the employees about what options had dairy in it for my lactose intolerance, they couldn't give me answers. Probably not the best place for dietary restrictions. I don't plan on coming back."

The roasted corn went so well with the tacos, and the tacos were juicy, crispy, and filling. - I went for the Mandarin salad. I'm a huge sucker for sweet and savory meals, and this hit the spot. The chicken adobo with the kick of sweet from the mandarin was amazing. New lunch inspo idea!Recommend this place even if the line to order can be a tad long."

They did have good music (In my opinion) playing loudly for the party vibe.The waitress was nice but very slow and English was not her first language.  It seemed she wasn't always clear on what we were asking for. Like salad dressing which didn't come with the salad. She brought out a different dressing then we asked for.Overall the food was tasty especially the lobster Mac n Cheese. It was cheesy and full of lobster a good start.  The bottomless mimosa option is always a plus with me. Besides the service I  was highly disappointed that my supposedly med-rare steak.  Which came out more med-well and cut into pieces like I was a child!?!?!  No wonder they didn't give me a steak knife...lol...smh!   Is precut steak really a thing!?!?!"

Before she arrived, I had a drink at the bar. I forget what it was called, but I believe it was a mix of a frozen margarita and a frozen sangria. Whatever it was, it was bomb and on the stronger side, although it was fruit forward. We were seated outside in the back. It was hotttt back there, which made it a tad bit uncomfortable. There was a DJ playing some afrobeats, dancehall and top 40. The vibes were vibing! We opted for the bottomless mimosas and got the chicken and waffles and the salmon and waffles as our entrees. Both were really yummy. I loved my salmon, which was cooked to perfection! The service wasn't exceptional, as we had to flag down different servers each time and often waited a while for things, but I'd most definitely go back and sit at the bar."

They allowed us to sit at the bar while we waited. Since it was over an hour wait, we decided to just get a table and order and wait there. The staff here was very welcoming and understanding. I thought we were going to be seated inside, but we were taken outback, which to my surprise, was heated! Once seated, it took a bit, but a sever came over and took our orders. Unfortunately, our server wasn't as welcoming as the other staff, and that seemed to be a continuous theme with him. We all ordered steak and eggs with a side grits. The food didn't take too long to come out, but wasn't the quickest either. The food was great, we all had no complaints there. My friend asked the salt and pepper and that request was ignored, and my other friend inquired 30 minutes later, which was then brought over. Every other request was met with a side eye or an attitude-- we didn't understand because we didn't ask for much, he never checked on us,  never provided water, and when it was time for dessert, I was provided a dirty spoon. The hostess saw me relentlessly attempting to get his attention and came over and was very apologetic-- I just didn't care to be ignored and didn't understand why he such a poor disposition. The vibe was pretty cool otherwise-- they had a DJ and played mostly reggae and a little R&B. I was a little turned off by the server, but say this is a decent brunch option for 90 minute bottomless mimosas. The menu is limited, however, $48 pp with an entree and mimosas is a solid deal."

So impressed by how far vegan food has come and rly enjoyed how they put together each dish. 1. Buffalo buns- a super hit! Felt and tasted like real meat and loved the fresh picked onion in there. The buns were also very fluffy and felt pretty authentic to me2. Kale Caesar- a well done kale salad is so rare but this was perfection. Great amounts of dressing, loved the crouton, and the little mushroom bacon bits were packed w umami3. KFB- major kung papa broccoli vibes! Very sweet/sour, beautifully fried, and pleasant to eat :)I recommend all the dishes we got and will for sure be going back for more. Two things: definitely need a res, and the staff was not super friendly or attentive. But! They still served us well and it didn't effect our experience."

I will only eat Ladybird's decadent, perfectly salty, truffle-infused, velvety al dente offering. And if I am sharing with you, I might even fight you for it. When choosing from a wide range of exciting vegan options in New York City, I will always land at one of my trifecta: Coletta, Spicy Moon and Ladybird. I suppose one might call this comfort food and normally that's nothing I gravitate towards (Szechuan and Italian are my mainstays), but again, Ladybird surprises me with its arancini (tiny crispy rice balls with slightly cheesy centers), deep fried mushroom bao buns, the best kale Cesar you will even dig into and the aforementioned mac and cheese.I haven't yet mentioned their Rose sangria. This, too, is perfection.And service, each time I've been, is nothing short of phenomenal.All enjoyed in a luscious little lair where you feel you might run into Alice, herself.

We were coming for brunch and I decided on the French Toast (8/10), Impossible sausage (8/10), and a whipped coffee (10/10). I'm a hot coffee drinker, but the whipped coffee was nice and creamy. It was a cool coffee, not too sweet, just right. My daughter ordered the Chick'n & Waffles (8/10)  and ""Ladybird Reunion cocktail "" (9/10).  If the food was hot, they would have gotten a 10/10.

For food we got the KFB, Potato Au Gratin, and Buffalo Maitaki Bun. The KFB was so good! Perfectly crispy with the right amount of spicy and sweet. Never thought broccoli could taste so good! The buffalo maitaki bun was probably my favorite, wish I'd gotten 2 orders of these! I'm not a huge potato person so the gratin was my least favorite but it still had good flavor.

Service was excellent as well throughout dinner. The highlight is of course the pastas. We got the king crab pasta special along with blue crab pasta and squid ink pasta. Surprisingly, the squid ink with shrimp and scallops was the best. It had the most interesting flavor with a great mix of textures. The other 2 pastas were fairly similar but I think the blue crab had slightly more flavor but not enough crab. The special had more crab but not quite as much depth of flavor in the sauce. Unfortunately I missed out on pictures of the appetizers, but the fluke crudo and beef tartar were the highlights even though the fluke was outrageously tiny. The entrées were nothing special, would stick to the pastas instead next time around. We got the steak, halibut, monkfish and none were particularly great. I thought for a NY strip steak, it was too chewy, but well seasoned and cooked properly. The portions of fish were super small but nothing blatantly wrong or surprising in any way. This place is definitely worth visiting for the pastas and appetizers, but they need work on their entrées."

Some dishes I'd like to highlight is the swordfish, risotto, and deer? or duck (unfortunately don't remember) but those represented great flavors, textures and temperature. Melted in the mouth.The cucumber radish dish definitely has potential - I do wish it was a little bit colder to give it a more refreshing, clean taste.The fish with cauliflower on top also has great potential. Enjoyed the fish in itself but the flavors didn't feel like they blended as thoroughly. Desserts were solid. Overall was a lovely first time experience here"

The dessert was cheesecake and was interesting yet tasty enough that I ordered one to go for the daddy taking care of the baby. Servicewise, I can see why they lost their Michelin star.

The risotto is very flavorful but I do find it strange that many ingredients were foreign to me and not throughly explained. My favorite part of the entire meal were the modernized desserts.What separates some of the greatest restaurants with Michelin stars to Ai Fiori is the service. It wasn't per se underwhelming but nothing to rave about similar to any other higher end restaurant in Midtown.

They also had a good beer bucket deal - 8 beers for $30. Add in the pool table and this is a decent place to stop in."

1324,w3t0p9aamiYGjn_Uubu2WQ,10/5/2020,3 star rating,"I would classify Winners as more of a dive bar than a sports bar, but their three prominent screens behind the bar would say otherwise. Seeing as divey + sports are among my favorite things in life, it's not hard to fathom that I've been here a time or two sloshing back a few or twelve. Like any place, one's mileage may vary. And in the case of Winners, I think having the right expectations will be critical to a semi-good if not great time. Some things to know:* Bartenders are your friend. Tip well and enjoy the heavy pour!* It is strictly cash only here. Credit cards are as foreign as English is in Elmhurst. (#1)* Not that it's dirty in the slightest, but a dive bar is a dive bar is a dive bar. Bathrooms might be worth skipping if you can.* They serve food here; Chinese food apparently. I've never had it. I'm not sure I want to. But when drunk, the idea of ::insert any protein:: fried rice or any of their fried seafood sounds like a fantastic idea. Most of the items I spotted on the menu were in the $13-18 range.* There is a pool table. Get your sanitizer ready. (#2)* When in doubt, go for the happy hour specials. A bucket of beer for $15 is a solid deal anywhere but at one point in time they also had $5 well cocktails as well. * Good company is a great way to take in any experience, good or bad. Bring a couple of friends and make sobriety a thing of the past. (#3)____________(#1) True story.

Drinks suck my friend thought her drink was over poured and I thought my drink taste like water. Best advise don't go!

What you put on a bagel MATTERS.  The tuna had no veggies. No powdered seasonings to make up for lack of veggies....not even a lil garlic powder and onion powder.  Also it's was a lil smear of tuna.  I could not finish it.  That's not a NY tuna on bagel.  The veggie cream cheese tasted good, it was just missing half the serving size.  Great for kids grabbing something before school or the older folks grabbing something to gab over.  I will give this a pass."

Btw it's the sidewalk portion of the mini mall near the Dunkin' Donuts, not inside near the parking lot. *for anyone else like me and can't figure it out *Anyways, when I found it there was a line outside, despite it being bone chilling cold. That's always a good sign. I picked up my order, bacon egg and cheese on an everything bagel. So simple but so easy to mess up. I'm glad I was not disappointed. The bagel tasted fresh, chewy but not gummy, and the everything seasoning was everything with that hint of salt that so many others miss causing them to fall flat. The bacon ratio was perfect cause we all know places tend to be stingy. My only complaint was the egg ratio was sparse. It looked like there was literally one large egg on it, not 2 or even a jumbo or something. But I was satisfied. I'll definitely be returning."

They're not inedible or anything, but they're very fat, doughy, bready, soft bagels and lack the flavor and chew I personally prefer in NY bagels. The scallion cream cheese I got was almost all cream cheese with only a little scallion mixed in. It has very little scallion flavor, and I would not recommend. I can understand that people would go here bc the bagel options are scarce in the area, but in my opinion, it's def not a 4 or 5 star bagel by any stretch of the imagination."

My friend went 30 minutes before to see if we could get a table and we had to stand. It was a post season game, but I'd definitely try to go early for a table if you go for a game day!"

Additionally, we were charged for an extra drink (Woodbridge) and one of the drinks being mislabeled in the receipt, we did not order champagne which isn't offered in the menu. Overall, it caused a collective extra cost of around $16.Despite the service, I have nothing else but praise for the food and it's definitely worth it just for that.

Your typical idea of a firefighter bar from a tv show or cheersy type vibes.  The food is decent but the wings are great, as are the burgers; this may be a blanket statement as I ordered my wings fry with medium sauce on the side and absolutely adored the crisp ones and unique Buffalo sauce.  My burger too was the firehouse version and I added sautéed 'shrooms.... This was the juiciest burger, my goodness I was in heaven every bite of the way! Crisp thick bacon, mushrooms onions peppers and the goooooiest cheese just truly hit the spot.  What an epic lunch vibe ad I sat out side with a nice sunny breeze assisted by a fan they have set up on the upper wall of their built-up outdoor seating.I'll say it was so good that I was excited to come back (problem being I did just that, immediately the same night with a friend who coincidentally wanted to stroll in... the problem I mentioned is her burger wasn't as good and when we moved to the tables on the 38th st side of the building we were swarmed with little tiny bugs of some sort, 3 in the full wine glass, burger covered, pelting my big doofus nose, walking across the table... it was terrible, I chugged my beer hoping to bounce quick but the waitress never really came back until I went inside twice to find her.   I've been here about five times over the past few months as I live within steps of the spot... I can't say I appreciate this particular waitresses consistent vibes or lack there of, but the bartenders I've encountered have all been solid to interact with.I don't think the other apps look at all worth it but the burger and wings are a great choice...Prices... pretty good for midtown Manhattan if you ask me, except that I didn't like paying $2 for mushrooms and $$30 for a burger and a beer on lunch then again, that included a tip so no biggie, especially taking into consideration how great of an afternoon I had dining with the pup on our lunch date."

Sometimes for lunch I'll get the BLT on whole wheat everything. I'm always tempted to try an egg sandwich but haven't yet.

We went for a birthday party which is the only reason I stayed until the end. The waiters are all young kids who, while doing the best they could, where obviously untrained and ill prepared. The food came out at a glacial pace and we had to keep asking for additional luxuries like butter for the stale bread and forks for the barely warm and sparsely plated food. I'll certainly not be going back here again!"

A lady walks in and goes behind the counter doesn't greet my or anything. I decide to take my money else where. Some guy standing outside having a full blown convo asks me what did I want? At first I ignored him. He then says 'I'm the owner what did you want?' Clearly he lacks customer service because who talks to a potential customer that way. What business owner lets a potential customer walk into their establishment and doesn't greet them knowing there's no staff at the counter. Please save your time and money.

1426,Ig4LSE3TRPs5nSsfTgnniQ,3/11/2023,5 star rating,"Whether hidden or not, this place is an absolute gem. The whole place is a vibe with the ambiance. Seems like a quaint location, so if possible, make a res unless you don't mind sitting at the bar. We started with the guac because of course. It was well made and balanced. Those chips had the right amount of salt and were wildly crisp. Kids asked for a whole other order! For drinks, we went with an old fashioned that was a palate pleaser, but the adult capri sum was too fun! It reminded me of a nice rum lunch, but had a strobing ice cube that instantly brought a smile to my face. The kids' lemonades also had a similar ice cube and tasted like fresh squeezed lemonade, which was fantastic. Ended with some rosé that never disappoints. For entrees, kids went with the usual chicken tendies and a burger. Both tasted fine and the chicken tenders were quite crispy and had the right flavor. We also had the Mexican surf and turf burrito. The burrito leaked a bit, but surprisingly didn't ruin the tortilla or anything else on the plate. The meat had the right flavor and spice, while the salad had an acidic, but refreshing dressing. That Mexican shrimp and scallop cocktail though! My goodness was that heaven served in a chip. I am overly picky when it comes to Mexican shrimp cocktail and this exceeded any and all expectations. Filled to the brim with protein and the flavor was fresh, acidic, and delightful. Great place to slip in for some guac and drinks or a full meal of your heart desires. But seriously, opt for the meal and fun drinks. They also have a cat robot that's uber cute bringing your food out. Absolutely loved seeing this thing maneuver through the place."

The food is an interesting mix of Mexican and Asian. Why 3 stars? That's something management needs to fix. First, the orders were rushed. Entrees came while we still worked on the appetizers. For no apparent reason, the place was not busy. The drinks are way overpriced for the amount of pour. It makes you feel a little ""stiffed"". Don't let my picking stop you from coming here."

But, $7 cortado and not attentive service stopped me from going there. I can find a place where to spend 40/50 bucks on an omelette and get appreciated as regular customer a bit more."

1437,kMljfja7weqfl_lzspjzHA,5/26/2022,4 star rating,"I came here twice with friends - but make a reservation because this place, although big, seems to be one that's typically PACKED! My meal started with the vegetarian Nicoise Salad - I appreciated that it was vegetarian, and that it actually tasted very good. The most disappointing part of the salad was that we eventually finished it and there was no more of it left on the plate. Not sure what they put in that dressing, but it really transformed something simple into something delicious and nuanced - with notes of something tart. We also ordered the deep fried artichokes. I was afraid that after the salad it wouldn't shine as much, but it did! The edges of the artichoke were light and crispy, and it came with this tangy sauce. Unfortunately, the second time I went to this restaurant, the artichokes were no longer on the menu. I've also tried the mac and cheese - it was really good, and a classic. It was clearly made with very high quality cheese, and it melted in your mouth. This dish is quite heavy, so it's better if you order this when you're really hungry. That said, I ordered the vegetarian rice bowl the second time I went, and it was quite disappointing. It was rice and vegetables floating around in a soup. The textures in this dish were inconsistent. Take caution that the soup in this dish was extremely spicy. The reason I got this dish is because that second time I was at the restaurant, the chef would not add garlic/herbs to the plain pasta for me. Understandably, the restaurant was quite busy but I would have appreciated one or two more vegetarian entree options, especially since the artichokes I had ordered the previous time were no longer on the menu. I felt like my options were limited to a burger, plain pasta, mac and cheese, and a spicy vegetable/rice soup bowl. That said, dessert was really good. The first time I had chocolate pudding. It was really rich and tasty. Unfortunately, I did not have enough space after the meal to finish it. The second time, I ordered the beignets. They were nearly bite-sized, and came with a jam and a syrup sauce. They were both really good, and the beignets melted in your mouth. If I come back (if this restaurant brings back the artichokes or more vegetarian entree options), I will definitely order the beignets again."
1438,kMljfja7weqfl_lzspjzHA,4/2/2023,2 star rating,I've always enjoyed my visits to Cafe Cluny until last night. The restaurant was lively but had a few open tables. Our server was attentive at first but after she forgot to put in our order it went downhill from there. Once our food finally arrived we put in a drinks order-two beers and a glass of wine (nothing complicated) and we still had to ask our server twice before getting our drinks. When the drinks did arrive we were all but finished eating. No apology. No reason for the delay. Just poor service. The food was yummy but we won't be going back any time soon. I emailed to share my shabby dining experience directly with the restaurant but didn't hear back from them. All in all the dinner left a bad taste in my mouth.
1439,kMljfja7weqfl_lzspjzHA,11/17/2022,3 star rating,Pricey for run of the mill new American food and the cocktail I got was in a very small glass. I had the lobster roll which tasted good but didn't have a lot of lobster in it and the fries were a bit too short for me as you can see a bit in the picture. What I did like about this place was the atmosphere - great to catch up with friends and the staff was nice enough to get us seated inside upon request even though our reservation was for outdoor seating.

We decided to give Cafe Cluny a try after hearing lots of good things. The service here was great! Everyone was very prompt and friendly. We made a reservation beforehand but they had a lot of walk in availability as well. The inside interior of this restaurant is very cute and intimate. We sat outside, it was a little cramped and slightly smelly. The drinks here are on the smaller side, but they are great quality and my gin gimlet was perfectly prepared. What was disappointing here was the food. The chicken was a nice texture but the flavor was seriously lacking. Additionally, the ""Brussels sprouts"" that came with it weren't actually sprouts, all I got were the leaves. The Au jus was also unremarkable. The fries here were also okay, nothing special for the price. For 30$ I think there are definitely better chicken dishes in the city. Overall I'd probably come back for drinks, but I wouldn't grab dinner here again."

I don't know what they were doing for people who only had cash.  One person was making the food  & the other was bagging.  For what they had to deal with, they did an okay job. But definitely understaffed! The fries were old & cold, as was the hot fudge for my sundae. I didn't think it was possible to have a bad tasting hot fudge sundae.  The mixer on the McFlurry machine wasn't working so they couldn't mix the oreos into the ice cream- so my son got ice cream topped with oreos instead of of a mcflurry.  Had someone been at the register, they might have been able to tell me this & I woulda ordered something else.  I already don't like coming to McDonald's, but the kids love it so I decided to treat them.  This put me off of McDonald's even more!  Really bad visit."

What appears to be a hole in the wall at first, transforms into a cozy, homey, feel good spot sprinkled with fairy lights. The waiters - who have all worked here for years - warmly greet regular patrons and get you seated. A few important notes before we get to the food: this place is strictly cash only, and t's only open from 5 pm onward. Try to get here earlier as there's usually a 45 min wait. On to the food: everything you get here is a win. Portions are large and sing in your mouth. For appetizers, would recommend the ciabatta with balsamic olive oil. Yum. My favorite entree is the Fettuccine Ragu with Shellfish. The shellfish was a tad sandy this time but was fine the last time I was here. Can't say I was a huge fan of the cannoli (too sweet for my taste), but my boyfriend quite enjoyed it. Absolutely fave dessert here: Panna Cotta.

""Noodle Pudding"" really makes you think (they do have noodle pudding on the menu.)This is an old school, cash only establishment with a menu that changes every day (they post it daily on Instagram.) They have a house red that is pretty tasty for $17 a bottle. Everything on the menu is classic and delicious from the octopus and potatoes to chicken Milanese. Make sure to order what they have on special, like the gnocchi or porcini mushroom pappardelle.The ambiance and experience of this restaurant is worth it alone, not to mention the quaint vibes of the neighborhood."

Average age is retirement and average color profile is porcelain. I guess I'm one of two (sometimes). The best thing about noodle pudding is it's an establishment, long serving the neighborhood with its classic and homemade Italian food. The worst thing is that it's an establishment, long serving the neighborhood so with that you get a certain attitude that I don't exactly jive with anymore.But regardless of that the food is very on point. Tasty to the last bite. And generous in portions. Make sure you bring cash money because they're still holding out on anything else. It comes from the chef who often feeds regulars it seems and caters to that clientele (see above vibes description). I prefer a to go since this is my hood so I can enjoy the comfort of homemade Italian food at home in a cozy environment. Everything I've tried here is delicious pasta."

Atmosphere: soft lighting, large and small tables, feels like an authentic local Italian spot. Price: average nyc $$ paid around $40 per person on a date. Portions are very large and they do not skimp on seafood though! Tuna steak: largest tuna steak I've been served in nyc. Comes on a big salad with capers and other veggies.Seafood ragu fettuccine: YES. First Raghu I've had that hasn't tasted only like tomato sauce. The seafood really shines in this and they have so many different types of fresh clams and seafood. Spicy Garlic bread: TO DIE FOR. Both extremely buttery and saucy but also really crunchy-this was the winner of our dinner."

The slices were steaming hot and generously sized. I tried a plain slice and a lasagna slice. The lasagna was messy due to the heavy toppings so I had to resort to using a knife and fork. But hey, no skimping! Yum. The plain cheese slice was also extremely cheesy though lighter with the sauce and featured a thin crust. Diners appeared to be a mix of solo folks, friends, and families. Good spot!"

1494,5Uo_a_Kl53O_yKglSR5nBA,5/27/2022,4 star rating,They offer a lot of good looking pizzas and sandwiches.  I ordered a plain cheese slice and it was really a very generous size slice.  It had just the right ratio of sauce and cheese plus their crust was light and crunchy.  Next time I am definitely taking a sandwich home.

The review is for both locations as my experience has been very good with both. The pizza slices are big, cheesy, greasy and delicious. My go-to's are the chicken and tomato, garlic knots, grandma's, and chicken rolls.  The slices are very flavorful and have enough wetness and crisp in them that every crunch feels like you're being filmed on a pizza tv commercial. Last time I ordered the 9 slice grandma's pie, I ate 7 slices in one sitting. Worth it. But hopefully you get the point of how delicious their food is. The only downside I have is that doing cardio to burn it off requires alot of effort, but I'll handle it.Anyway, if you're looking for good delicious pizza thats been around for longer than most people in this App gives Rosa's a try. You wont regret your decision."

They have all the classics and more! (I.e. ravioli pizza)I tried the classic Sicilian with sauce on top and cheese on the bottom. Wish it had more sauce like the famous L &B Spumoni in south Brooklyn. But still it was nice.The lasagna slice was HUGE! Can easily fill you and your girlfriend. The slice was very sauce and well balanced. Had anoles amount of meat, sauce and ricotta. Highly recommend! The size is comparable to Artichoke pizza slices.Cheers! Would be back for more if I'm in the area."

Their sauce is delicious, nice level of sweetness and this crust is perfect. Enough structure without being too thick. Big fan of their garlic knots too. Caesar salad is pretty solid but going to ask for dressing on the side next time, was way too wet for a salad when I ordered for delivery this week."

I am a sauce gal (some might say saucy) and you can TASTE that the sauce is homemade with love. Perfect combination of tangy, not too salty mozzarella, sweet, sauce with lots of tomato flavor, and a crispy crust. I totally understand now why Rosa's is an Astoria staple and often referred to as one of the best places for a pie in the neighborhood. Brava, Rosa."

I was browsing for a local pizza spot close to my apartment and wanted to reconsider Rosa's  after a long hiatus. I kept coming across images of their grandma pie and told myself I would give it one more shot. Although ordering and picking up a pie is quite a logistical disaster, the grandma pie that I got tonight made up for my last experience and the wait tonight. Although this place does not have any sort of rhyme or reason with their ordering system, the quality of their pizza has improved since my last visit and I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived home and opened my pizza box. Thank you for quality pie tonight and I look forward to trying the other slices soon. Disclaimer * I took 1 star off due to having to wait an hour when I was initially told 30 minutes. I also was confused why none of the workers wore a mask nor any hand gloves when dealing with food, money, cheese, pizza toppings, etc."

They have an adorable cafe in the back with delicious savory and sweet items. The food is Italian. I had a delicious risotto ball ($4.50) with roasted eggplant and ricotta salata inside. It was a generous size and a great snack. You can get three balls for $12. Their cookies all look fabulous! I tried the chocolate chip and I really enjoyed it. I can't wait to return."

But seriously, this place was almost created for a cookbook nerd slash baker like myself!! Which is why I was introduced to the shop in the first place. Even people who know me knew I would love this place. When I had to downsize my apartment, all my books went to my sisters garage but my cookbooks. My cookbooks! I couldn't dare shove them in a dark room. They are meant to be displayed. They bring me joy and they guide me in creating beautiful meals and treats that make my friends and family happy. The curating of the cookbooks is impressive!! I saw so many of my favorites from local bakeries cookbooks like Baked, Four and Twenty Blackbirds to local restaurants like Buvet and Nomad. Then the treats section had heavy hitters like Dorie Greenspan. Vegetarian cookbooks had all the staples like Moosewood. And there is even a food memoir section. I have meaning to get Colin Atrophy Hagendorf's ""Slice Harvester"". This little punk rocker ate a slice of pizza at every pizza joint in Manhattan and lived to talk about it. I already started reading this and it's hilarious!!!  Oh then there's the cute little kid sized kitchen area with food books like one of my childhood favorites Maurice Sendak's ""In the Night Kitchen"". And I also had an obsession with child size kitchens from the day my little brother was born. I got to play with one and I wanted one ever since. And if allllllll that wasn't enough. They have more of my favorite past time, coffee and treats!! I wanted the pistachio lace cookie but they were all devoured by the time I got there. From what I hear Lipari makes these Italian treats. I think I feel future BFF coming on.Yesterday was independent bookstore day. If you spent a $100 you got a free tote (Baggu brand so yeah...quality) and if you bought a cookbook you would get a free cookie. I bought a coffee, a good memoir and chatted this young ladies ear off. I'm pretty sure she regretted pouring me regular coffee but she was super sweet.And last but not least. The bathroom here is huge. I absolutely love the Andy Warhol cake print and the measuring cup vase for the flowers. I will be visiting more often until my move in is complete! Ha! Alright...

The shop and cafe comprise a wonderland unto themselves, but Archestratus Food & Books is so much more than that. Paige has carved out a space for events as carefully curated as the book selection as well as created a community.

The combination of flavors was unique, and delicious enough to warrant a second drink.I also ordered the egg sandwich, consisting of scrambled eggs, American cheese, pickled chili peppers, and tomato aioli on a brioche bun. The sandwich was good, and a fitting complement to the drinks, but it wasn't nearly as memorable.I would definitely stop by again for the ambience and the brunch cocktails, as these factors make Clover Club a great place to get together with friends."

The clover club cocktail is a drink that was created in Philadelphia even before Prohibition. This bar was ranked one of the top bars in the world and is the sister bar to another top bar Leyenda across the street.My first drink was the clover club ($16) which I had to order because it's their namesake drink. It was delicious, easy to drink, and the egg white added a nice texture. I asked the bartender how many he makes a night and he couldn't give me a number and said, ""A lot."" My second drink was the pineapple smash ($15) which was a sweeter drink from the pineapple. I noticed that they add the green chartreuse as a float on top versus in the drink and the bartender said it makes the drink more rich.They also have happy hour Monday through Friday 4-6pm along with a large menu selection for dinner.

The steak appetizer was delicious and cooked to perfection.I finished the experience with their spin on a Negroni using mushroom-infused Campari.  Very tasty, and a serious cocktail that warranted slow sipping.Friendly, knowledgeable bartenders.  Prices were very reasonable for the quality received.  The Clover Club was a better experience overall than the pretentious cocktail bars in Manhattan.  Will definitely return!"

Or maybe I'm just a grandma now??I had a much better cocktail experience at Barely Disfigured, which I'd recommend over CC. They do have an extensive drink menu, but nothing really caught my attention. I ended up getting something similar to a spicy marg, and while she did warn me it would be spicy, it was just a little toooo much to blend well with the drink."

The second time I was there a little miscommunication occurred and I ended up reaching out to whoever in charge via email and just tried to get clarity on the situation. One of the owners called me back and was just so genuinely amazing. Great person to speak to. My fiancé and I went back a few weeks later and they just went over and beyond to make up for the miscommunication. Right there showed me this place not only has amazing drinks and amazing food but the customer service is great. Made us so extremely happy. The place is very cute; I love the ambience. Definitely a cute spot to have a birthday outing or some occasion. Again, I can't stress how amazing the food and drinks were as well! Love it here!"
1541,wua1Rw6xlIm6VYVy44G87g,3/18/2023,5 star rating,We came here for my daughter's 16th birthday.  We were searching and searching for restaurants online and my wife happen to see pictures of the wall of books and stained glass.  Classy and out of this world quality and service. My youngest chose lobster salad and mushroom side. Oldest went with a mushroom starter and my wife had the diver scallops.  I had the halibut- we were all impressed.  The deviled egg (quail?) was a great beginning.   Four waiters brought our dishes out and the BEST part??Everyone from the restaurant signed a birthday card for my daughter.   No tacky singing- just a high class card and simple candle when we had desert.  Yes- we each had dessert that were equally tasty and beautiful to see. We would definitely return and recommend this to friends.
1542,wua1Rw6xlIm6VYVy44G87g,2/27/2023,4 star rating,"Late review. Came for RW with the ladies. They are one of the few that allows you to order from the regular menu plus they did give my friend a birthday card and sang to her, so 4 stars.The portions are generous and the food is served promptly. Ambiance is beautiful and great for a birthday celebration. The only thing I want to bring up is how salty a lot of the items are. For appetizers, we got almost everything on the menu since there were five of us. My favorites were the tartare and pasta. The arugula salad was a salt lick - the dressing plus the Parmesan cheese made the salad so salty it was inedible. However this was resolved with a quick note to our waiter who kindly replaced our salad and put the cheese separately (we didn't use it).For mains, the standouts were the seafood dishes - cod and scallop dishes were amazing. The lamb was delicious too and a very generous portion. The pork chop was cooked to the most perfect temp and was tender and juicy. I wasn't that impressed with the beef which I felt was outshined by the other mains. Many of the choices had additional supplemental charges from $5-$15, so make your choice wisely. Dessert was lovely and a great ending to the night."
1543,wua1Rw6xlIm6VYVy44G87g,2/23/2023,5 star rating,"Wow, this place is for the date of all dates. Can't overstate how gorgeous the interior is. When you walk in, you're in the bar area, which is more of a lounge with sofa seating, tables.. I honestly don't even remember exactly what the furnishing and decor was like but it is all very cute and well done. Make a far right into the dining room and it's totally romantic and lively (as well)! Flowers all around, white table cloths etc.. the vibe is definitely datey but could also work for a group of friends, or family. the menu ranges from veg to meat options- we went with the fish and scallops- obviously a $$$ kind of place but worth the visit in my opinion. Before the meal, they served bread and an amuse bouche- a taste of something with fish. It was all great- no complaints.The service was a little on the slower side, or on the more relaxed side, depending on how you look at it. Much better than waiters who hover over the table trying to snatch plates or utensils away trying to clear tables. overall, had a great experience. woo wooo"
1544,wua1Rw6xlIm6VYVy44G87g,2/15/2023,4 star rating,"My boyfriend and I came here for Valentine's Day last night. We had a 9PM reservation and they sat us right away. Our seats weren't ideal, they put us extremely close to the table next to us. Every time they needed to get up they would physically have to move our table to get through. We sat side by side in a corner booth and my side of the couch had been worn out so I was extremely low; I folded up my jacket and sat on it to give me a boost. It also happened to be our anniversary so the waiter gave us a card with staff signatures that said Happy Anniversary, very thoughtful. They also gave each table one long stem red rose, which I kept!Dinner began with an amuse-bouche of Oysters; we also got bread/butter and started off with two glasses of Chardonnay. Oysters are not my thing but my bf ate both of them and he said they were great. The menu was pre-fixed so we got to have a 4 course dinner for $175.00. There were 3 choices for the first 3 courses and 2 options for dessert.For our first course we started with the Big Eye Tuna Tartare and Ossetra Caviar. The tuna had great flavor, it had apples and a sort of citrus taste. I just wish they served it with rice crackers or something instead of nothing. The caviar was fresh, the presentation was also very nice but I wish they used something other than the potato chips. The chips were very salty and so was the caviar itself, so there was a lot of salty flavor happening.For our second course we both had the chestnut agnolotti with black truffle and Brussel sprouts and WOW. SOOOO GOOD. Wish there was more on the plate so we both could have eaten another round.For our main course we had the Wagyu Sirloin and the Diver Scallops. My steak was cooked medium, super soft, and had great flavor. Loved the creamed spinach on the bottom, the sauce and the wood mushrooms on top. The scallops were also very good, especially combined with the cabbage and black truffle vinaigrette.For dessert we got the Baked Alaska and the Mille-feuille. The baked Alaska was great; it was chocolate cake with passionfruit caramel & banana ice cream. The mille-feuille had blood orange and vanilla ice cream wasn't my favorite. Over the two the baked Alaska was definitely better.In the end, it was a great dinner experience. The atmosphere was very nice, I loved the decor/vibe of the bar/dining area. We didn't really see much of our waiter only in the beginning to take our order and just once/twice to refill our water. Our favorites were the agnolotti, wagyu sirloin, and the scallops. If we ever come back that would be my order!"

The ""Bar room"" is nice, always busy, good service also. I used to sit in the couches on this side sometimes when I'd pop in here after work with friends. The cocktails are amazing here! I ordered shishito peppers and little gem lettuces before, but I'd mostly come for a sip or meeting. So recently, I dined at the Temple Court! Very intimate ambience and prompt service. We ordered NY Strip Steak, Big eye Tuna Tartare, with side of crispy fingerling potatoes. They serve a little bread and butter at first. The steak was medium and super juicy. I enjoyed it, the tuna tartare definitely was flavorful.  For drinks we got a scotch, and myself espresso martinis with reposado. Everything was a delight here, and maybe I'll be back for dessert next time!"
1546,wua1Rw6xlIm6VYVy44G87g,1/23/2023,5 star rating,"Dreamy, sexy and gorgeous--a dinner at Temple Court will not disappoint.My friend and I dined here during Restaurant Week and for $60 (which of course doesnt include drinks, gratuity and taxes), they offered a delicious 3 course meal. A reservation via Resy was confirmed on one of the busiest nights during the week--Thursday, but I snagged the reservation prior to RW.We were brought to the table quickly and greeted by the hospitable server. There were no missteps during our entire dining experience as service was stellar and ambience was over the top stunning. This restaurant celebrates you and at the same time, you can celebrate it--any occasion--Temple Court lends such a charming vibe.When it came time to order drinks, I was ambivalent between choosing Rose or Reisling. Fear not, I was able to try both before selecting and I went with the smooth Rose. It was time to choose our courses. My selection was Mussels, Codfish and the Chocolate Cake for dessert. My friend ordered the same main, Codfish, but deviated with her appetizer and dessert choices. Hers was the Agnoletti (which is a type of Ravioli) and Lemon Meringue Tart for dessert.Prior to being served our first course, Amuse Bouche (sweet potato soup) and two flaky dinner rolls were brought to the table.The Mussels were a pretty good sized portion (I'd say around 10) served with 3 slices of charred bread. The sauce was a bit creamy and I devoured the entire plate in no time. It was flavorful and executed very well.The Roasted Codfish was delicious and  a very generous portion placed on beans, vegetables and sprinkled with a few Vongole. It was outstanding  and my friend agreed. The Rose wine accompanied the meal very well since I kept everything pescatarian.The grand finish was dessert and mine was a chocolate ganache cake topped with ice cream and sprinkled with Amaretto cookie bits. It was a dessert that reflected the entire meal (service and ambience)---amazing.Some Restaurant Week menus can be hit or miss but Temple Court was a wonderful experience especially if one has never eaten here. Like me.It's a truly great experience when a restaurant hits all the right notes across the board--food, service and ambience.This described Temple Court.I want to return---and soon."

They were still not accepting walk ins. There are limited numbers of parking spots around the restaurant. Be prepared to spend some time if you are looking for street parking.Restaurant week comes with 3 menus at temple court. I chose burrata, hanger 6 coconut sorbet.Burrata - cheese is a little dry, and sauce was too sweet. I liked how well it was presented. All ingredients were fresh. I liked how everything was except dryness and sweetnessHanger steak - well cooked. It's probably one of the better meat dishes I had in a while. Portion was good enough for 170lb men. Very flavorful and juicyCoconut sorbet - hated the most. This was not a sorbet. This was a corporate grocery grade sugar bombed ice cream... i was really disappointed with this and left the entire desert. I dont recommend this."

The combination of taste, flavors, and textures was amazing. I will get that salad everytime I go back. It's really not a question. MUST MUST MUST have. Live Music - Monica and I went on Sunday after church. We walked in around 1pm and there was a three piece all female band playing covers of classic R&B songs from the 1990s, and 2000s. They were great. They said they play every Sunday for 2-3 hours. So, if you want some easy listen live music - this is your place. Cocktails - We had coffee and shared a mezcal based cocktail that was pretty impressive. We looked through their menu and wanted to grab other drinks but, since we went hard the night before, we refrained. Pro tip: Sit far away from the door in the winter but avoid sitting directly below the opening that looks straight up to the roof. Long story short, there is a draft if you are in a seat that is below the iconic view up. It was pretty annoying every time the door opened in front of the restaurant there would be a draft that went through the 4 tables that were in our row."

So we started waiting... after 15 mintes they said our table opened but had to be cleaned, which took another 10 minutes.  Then we got seated but waited another 10 minutes for our server.... finally we were able to order... but then the food came slowly.  Service was a solid 2 stars.Food was avocado toast for one person, Beekman Breakfast for 2 others, French Toast for a fourth and Salmon plate for me.  The Salmon was good but didn't have enough cream cheese with it. The avocado toast was bustin'.  The potatoes with the Beekman breakfast were undercooked and weird.  French toast was good.  Food overall was about a 3.5.  Then the bill came....$175 and a $30 tip got the total to $205.  That averaged $40 a person.  And yes the 2 kids got orange juice, and there was a spare yogurt granola bowl ordered. And yes it is New York.  But I am sorry... that is just too much for what we got.  So two stars.  Would try to never go back.  In fact, I think there is a Starbuck's across the street...."

Plus they're open 24 hours. That alone gets it 2 stars. So what gives?First and foremost, the service is rough. I know they must deal with a lot of angry people but the staff is constantly giving serious 'tude here. It doesn't matter if you're ordering inside or via the drive-thru; it's very much a your mileage may vary situation more so than other locations I've been to.Secondly, has anyone seen the prices? When did meals get this close to $10? This isn't the airport. To make matters worse, it's even more expensive on delivery platforms like UberEats and DoorDash. It's very easy to rack up some serious $$$ without actually ordering a lot.This might really be a NYC area issue, but after a certain time at night the dining room is loaded with crazies. There is a viral vid moment ready to happen at any time; dodginess has no bounds really.Lastly, don't even think about using the bathrooms. Don't do it. Get your food and get out.

My most recent experience at this mcdonalds was the worst i've seen in 25 years eating at mcdonalds. I order two breakfast meals #4 and #6. I said it 5 times and she charged me for two sandwiches without the meal. I don't understand how you can get this wrong. The menu says #4 or #6 meal. I did not say bacon egg mcgriddle, i said #4 which is the meal picture on screen. Then to make things worse, she told me she cannot cancel the order, so i will have to order the drinks and hash brown separately. Okay fine, i will order them separately. Then she tells me i cannot use the same credit card to purchase this meal. I was like WHAT???? I never heard such thing... fine forget it. I use another credit card. Now everything is ordered in two receipts, I wait for my food... I got my food and then drinks, but i ordered a large coffee... they try to stiff me with a small coffee. On top of all this, they forgot to add Apple pie to my order... but whatever just like i did not order it.I don't know what happened after the renovation. Maybe the workers pissed because all their coworkers got replaced by the new fancy ordering machines that was put in place. This Mcdonalds establishment definitely got way worse. I was fine dealing with service with no smile. I'm not big on customer service, i just order and go, but this is ridiculous!!!"

That did not stop me from contributing to this business and I decided to go in. Ordered my favorite Chinese bakery item which is a pineapple bun. I had to tell the lady what I wanted and she got it for me, they have a divider inside I guess because of COVID reasons still. I went back outside and walked a few blocks to finally eat my bun. This was hands down the best pineapple bun I ever had. It was still warm and fresh out of the oven. Perfect texture, crumbly, and sweet. Hands down my new favorite and best in NYC.Next time when I'm in the area I'll make sure to revisit. 5/5 stars"
1612,_4UvguU5z2hMsHXlYedFXw,1/28/2023,3 star rating,I tried the Portuguese egg tart and sponge cake. The egg tart was 7.5/10 and good for the price! It hits for spot if you're craving egg tarts. These egg tarts taste almost exactly like the one from Double Crispy Bakery a block away so I don't think you can go wrong with either bakery. The sponge cake (6/10) was very eggy which I like but it was too dry.
1613,_4UvguU5z2hMsHXlYedFXw,1/4/2023,5 star rating,One of my favorite places in Chinatown to get egg tarts and Mochi! It's a very small bakery. No seating but I like to take mine home to eat so I didn't have any issues with that. Its also probably why they have one of the cheapest desserts in Chinatown! But that's not the only reason why I keep coming back for more. Their Mochi's are big with a perfect chewy consistency. I'm obsessed with their fresh mango Mochi but also really like their red bean green tea Mochi. The egg tarts are also really good egg flavor and flaky crust. I like to take it home and pop it in my oven to heat it up but if you're lucky you can catch these fresh and still warm when you buy them.
1614,_4UvguU5z2hMsHXlYedFXw,8/30/2022,5 star rating,"I initially came across Tao Hong Bakery when looking for places to get egg tarts in Chinatown but unexpectedly found that the mochi here are a must try! My friend and I got 2 egg tarts, a mango mochi, and a green tea mochi to share. The mochi were soft and chewy, and the mango one had fresh mango inside of it making for such a creamy, fruity, and delicious treat. We found that the mango mochi was quite a bit softer than the green tea one (which held its shape a bit more) - not sure if this is because of the fruit/cream inside the mango one or if it's just because we waited until getting home to eat the mochi so they were sitting for a little.I'm craving a mochi now as I'm writing this review, but Tao Hong does also have a variety of breads/other pastries and drinks I'd like to come back and try. Overall, this is a small but unexpectedly delicious and underrated bakery in Chinatown. Definitely come check it out while you're in the area!"

The people in the bakery are also very friendly. I want to try other items from the bakery. I look forward to trying other items off their menu. The pork buns were fresh and tasty.

And super inexpensive, $1.25 each!!!  And don't forget, right next door is Chinatown's most famous but least expensive BBQ (pork, chicken, duck). Always a line but worth the wait! (Red awning).

If you like HK-style pineapple buns, then you should definitely try the pineapple bun here. I loved the flaky, crispy, sweet, and buttery topping. It's perfect when paired with their super fluffy bread. If you're lucky and stop by early enough, their pineapple pork bun is life-changing!I also tried their hot dog bun and pineapple kaya bun.

I had to tell the lady what I wanted and she got it for me, they have a divider inside I guess because of COVID reasons still. I went back outside and walked a few blocks to finally eat my bun. This was hands down the best pineapple bun I ever had. It was still warm and fresh out of the oven. Perfect texture, crumbly, and sweet.

1623,_4UvguU5z2hMsHXlYedFXw,1/4/2023,5 star rating,One of my favorite places in Chinatown to get egg tarts and Mochi! It's a very small bakery.

But that's not the only reason why I keep coming back for more. Their Mochi's are big with a perfect chewy consistency. I'm obsessed with their fresh mango Mochi but also really like their red bean green tea Mochi. The egg tarts are also really good egg flavor and flaky crust. I like to take it home and pop it in my oven to heat it up but if you're lucky you can catch these fresh and still warm when you buy them.

My friend and I got 2 egg tarts, a mango mochi, and a green tea mochi to share. The mochi were soft and chewy, and the mango one had fresh mango inside of it making for such a creamy, fruity, and delicious treat. We found that the mango mochi was quite a bit softer than the green tea one (which held its shape a bit more) - not sure if this is because of the fruit/cream inside the mango one or if it's just because we waited until getting home to eat the mochi so they were sitting for a little.I'm craving a mochi now as I'm writing this review, but Tao Hong does also have a variety of breads/other pastries and drinks I'd like to come back and try.

You'll be eating off of paper plates and your table will be sticky, but whatever you order will be good, tasty, and consistent. Manny and Jose have been feedings folks at this spot for almost three decades and they've done it consistently and at super cheap prices. Some of my personal favorite orders are the pastrami and egg platter, gyro, and burger...but you really can't go wrong no matter what you order.

At one point tou can get a huge meat pattie that was greasy delicious and bigger than the bun with fresh fries made with real pirates. All for the special price of 2.75 (1998) we had great memories here. Now it's a lil different and sadly we rarely go back. During hurricane sandy this place was packed every morning. You get a monster breakfast combo for under 5 bucks. Including home fries 2 eggs any style bacon whole wheat toast and coffee. I find it halarious that after almost 20 years of a crappy tv they put in a plasma almost 50 inch tv it's huge, never thought I'd see the day ;) lol"

The food is absolutely amazing and the prices are unbelievable. All breakfast orders come with hash browns and 2 slices of bread all for only $4! They have other diner food such as sandwiches and burgers (all at an affordable price), but I stuck to the breakfast items to start off my day with a hearty meal. The chef seems to be very passionate about his job, it was a joy to watch him cook. Great service, great food, great price and great people, can't beat that!Side note: They do free delivery."

Its always packed on the weekends and during the weekday morning rush but the coffee is strong and right and way better than Starbucks I love this place its a fixture in Richmond Hill and the prices, are fair As long as Jose is cooking I dont mind the beat up furniture and cramp space Manny needs to rid himself of that giant soda cooler that don't work and invest in smaller ones."

Having lived abroad for the past seven years, no trip is complete without paying a visit to Manny and Jose. The old Cheers addage applies, though where Jose will not call you by your name he will warmly address you as ""papi"" or ""mami.""This place is beyond grundgy and divey in appearance, as it is on Jamaica Avenue conveniently located right under the 121st Street train station, but don't let it fool you for a second as the food is beyond worth it. All the food is cooked right in front of customers as well. This place is and forever will be referred to by two names: ""the diner"" and ""grease spot.""Gyro Platter - Frozen gyro patties but produce is fresh and there's a shitload of French fries and it's SO damn cheap too.Pastrami Egg Platter - Great for hangovers, my brother's personal favorite order. Homefries or french fries.Breakfast Special (homefries, two eggs, bacon or sausage, toast, coffee or tea) - Also great for nursing hangovers. Easily bests whatever breakfast concoction the Classic diner, formerly known as the Olympic diner, formerly known as the Junction diner has to offer.1/4lb cheeseburger - This makes McDonalds look like an Olsen twin. Also very cheap. Enough said.Grilled Chicken Sandwich w/ mozzerlla, tomato and hot sauce - My personal favorite and in many ways my own sandwich appointed by Jose years ago. Also cheap (catch the drift).Also, if you are impressed by teppenyaki chefs, wait until you have seen Jose work the grill on a weekday morning."

I had just missed my train and wouldnt be seeing another for a good 10 minutes. I decided to get a cup of coffee. The joint was empty for the exception of the man who was dining at the counter. I walked up to the lady at the register and asked her for a large coffee, regular. I am a very polite person. I used to work at a coffee shop and really hated when customers were demanding or rude... so i make sure to say Please and thank you all the time. Well. Ms. Thang slammed my cup on the counter (a styrofoam cup at that! BOOOOOO!) and filled it with my coffee. She plopped it onto the counter and stared at me expectantly.Oh, im sorry. Am I supposed to know how much it is by your GLARE?""how much?""She rolled her eyes and said ""$1.20"". Wow thats cheap. I took out a dollar and in record time grabbed a quarter out of my pocket. ALL while Ms. THANG tapped her foot impatientiently and breathing heavily. I took my coffee. said THANK YOU. and walked out. She sucked her teeth.I seriously hope she has a better day. My coffee? it was okay. Kinda watery but def better than dunkin donuts."

We ordered beef negimaki, shogun roll, and nabeyaki udon.We were intrigued by beef negimaki from its eye-catching photo on the menu, but the real thing? It's good but not something I'd get again. The sauce was good but the beef was a lil tough and the flavor gets old after eating two rolls. Shogun roll was a nice addition but the highlight was the nabeyaki udon. The dashi broth was flavorful without overwhelming you and they gave huge shrimp tempuras. Overall pleasant experience."

The platter of fish, though , was large and the fish tasted fresh.  That's the top requirement as far as I'm concerned!  The Love Boat is a mixture of sushi, roll plus nigiri, and an assortment of sashimi.  Everything on that platter was very good!So, when I crave sushi in the neighborhood, this will be a better alternative to the two other local places we've tried, not for the quality of the fish and the cost, more than one place and a lot less than the other!  I'd probably do takeout, though!"

This is awesome now that the Coronavirus is scaring everyone away from public spaces.The food is always fresh unless you come before closing, that's when you might get the ends of certain things. I've came on a few occasions right before closing and they had no lettuce and another time they had no cheese. The staff always greets with a smile and provide great portions -- who doesn't love a good scoop of rice / beans. I love Chipotle and I appreciate the consistency of the taste. There's plenty of space for eating within the restaurant. They have 1 rest room which has a line most of the time I visit but otherwise it's like every other chipotle."

We are too busy, they said. If we serve you, we will be here all night. OK then...Please either lock the door when you're not serving people anymore, or change the sign on the door to 11 AM - whenever we please. All right, I get it. We are amidst a national labor shortage and so they are shortstaffed. I get it. But I had to eat Chick-fil-A yesterday because this place turned me away before they were supposed to close.(Life is pretty grand - Chick-fil-A is bomb)"
1671,cGQZOrC0Dn_-E2a8CGhh0A,11/14/2021,2 star rating,The one employee I interacted with was pretty nice but the restaurant is filthy. Like every single table was dirty. Floor was sticky in some areas. There was no line and only a couple of customers sitting. Yet no one was cleaning. Troublesome for a restaurant but even more troublesome during Covid times. There was literally outside food from Dunkin Donuts on the Chipotle pickup cart. I only came into grab a bottle of water and use the bathroom. I don't think that I would trust eating from here with how unkempt the restaurant was.
1672,cGQZOrC0Dn_-E2a8CGhh0A,1/20/2022,1 star rating,"This Chipotle is a disaster location. I don't know how they continue to operate in this space, but it is really not okay from so many perspectives.To start off there's always an alarm going off or some weird set of sounds by some of the doors. It's like they haven't figured out how to fix it, and there's no reason for that to continue. It's quite annoying, but really the least of their problems.If you show up during the hours listed on the door you will not be guaranteed a meal. I have shown up at 9:35 and not been able to get a burrito. Why? Because they close at 10...or so they said. I was quite upset. Additionally if you go early you might not be able to get all the ingredients you want. It's highly likely that they won't have onions and peppers until an hour or two after they've opened!Also, without fail, 1 in 3 times they try to make a me a burrito they fail at wrapping it. I've never seen this at any other chipotle. This chipotle on multiple ocassions scrapes out what's in the burrito and puts it in a new tortilla. Every time they have done this i've ended up with nearly no guacomole because it's somehow not scraped into my new burrito. The last time this happened I tried to talk to them about it. They didn't seem to care.Don't go to to this chipotle. Burrito Box is close by, there's a Dos Toros not too far away, really you have a lot of options. This is not the right one!"

1674,cGQZOrC0Dn_-E2a8CGhh0A,7/1/2020,2 star rating,"I love chipotle! But at this location, it was my first time ordering delivery. I ordered a bowl with barbacoa and steak, 1/2 and 1/2. I ordered it with lettuce, sour cream, cheese, and guac (and extra freaking $2.70). You know how many avocados I can buy for $2.70? A hell of a lot more than what they added.I would appreciate a HEAPING scoop of guac for that price. Everything else was very minimal too.As another yelper mentioned, I'm usually full from chipotle and this is the first time I was not full. It's very disappointing!! Especially for $18 (bowl plus tax, delivery, and tip). Sooo not worth it.I'll try a different location next time. Not this one again."

There was only one other person in line behind us at the time. Once we finished ordering the food, the chicken rice bowl that my girlfriend had ordered Barry had any of the toppings that we asked for. The bowl on the right in the picture barely even had any lettuce and was only filled half way. Definitely not worth the time and money of going there and getting food."

They have a huge menu and every visit I spend about five minutes looking at it.  And even though they offer a ton of options and varieties, I usually only ever order my favorites...watermelon or blood orange ices.  So delicious and refreshing.  It doesn't have that artificial taste like some Italian ices have.  Other items on the menu are milk shakes, ice cream, ice cream sandwiches, sundaes and icai bowls. They have a lot of sugar free items as well.  We love Ralph's and we'll continue to come but I have noticed that prices have steadily gone up.  Sigh, I guess that's not too surprising in NYC."

Since I don't travel to queens that much I wanted to get a little bit of everything. Started off with their Ralph's sandwich. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have anymore waffles in an early afternoon. Their other options were cookie, pound cake and pancake. I went with cookies for my chocolate chip fudge ice cream. You can also heat up your Ralph's sandwich and get a drizzle on top. If you like fruity pebbles, you should try their fruity pebble milkshake. I just thought their straw was a little too thin for their milkshake. It was kind of hard drinking it. Obviously since you're at an Italian ice place, you had to order one. They have four sizes (kiddie, small, medium or large) . I tried their blue Hawaii which is basically blue raspberry and their root beer. Planning to come back here again to try more from their menu."

I absolutely love coming here to grab something cold and delicious, especially during those really hot days during the summer.The inside has a few seats in the front but most of the place is used to store all the different flavors of flavored ice. My favorite is definitely the soft serve. It is incredibly thick and smooth. On Tuesdays, you can come with a friend and you both can get a Twister for the price of one. It's the soft serve with a water ice that you can put in the middle. It is really tasty!I also really love the strawberry cheesecake creme ice. It has chunks of actual cheesecake in it.A great place to go if you want to try different flavors of ice cream!"

Plenty of time sthey've told me that's its CASH ONLY. So I would go across the street to ATM.However I was there a couple of weeks ago to pick up my food and the young lady behind the counter swipes a customer's debit card and total was $9.50Today I ordered my food and give the other young lady my debit card and she looks at me and says you need  $15 minimum.Very rude. I just walked out. But I will not be going back. I am looking forward to speaking to the owner when I see him. You need to post it somewhere that you take debit/credit and minimum is $15.The rules should apply to everyone not whenever you feel like.

Everything looked and smelled amazing.Though the ""feel"" is French, I was taken back by the offerings on the menu.French, Italian, Indian, Mediterranean, BBQ, along with the specials gave me the impression that the chef was trying to be all things to all people.   My first course was perfectly sliced thin prosciutto, accompanied with fresh greens, mozzarella with a dollop of an olive tapenade that brought it all together.My wife started with a roasted beet salad, with a light vinegarette that was just heavy enough to stand up to the beets without overpowering its earthiness.My Tandoori Chicken rivaled what I've had in some of the best Indian restaurants in NYC. Flavorful with a touch of spice. Outstanding.My wife enjoyed the Lobster Ravioli in a light vodka sauce and hasn't stopped asking me to return tomorrow, the day after and the day after...The desserts were all homemade, including the ice cream which paired perfectly with the strawberry trifle and the banana foster soufflé.And the people next to us couldn't stop raving about the fresh banana pudding.If I could give 10 Stars, I would.Bravo!!"

They have a bunch of great vegetarian options as well. My boyfriend enjoyed his Duck and said the caramelize glaze smeared on top really gave the duck the kick it needed!

The servers are very nice and it was crowded for a Friday lunch.I ordered the duck confit. The duck was very soft, and the skin was crispy. It seemed to be cooked well, but it was missing flavor. It was served with mashed potatoes, which was tasty. The mixed vegetables looked like the bag of frozen mixed veggies you can buy at the grocery store. Not much flavor but did not taste bad. Probably a hit or miss depending on what you order."

The reviews seemed positive and the food looked authentic yet unpretentious, so I made an early dinner reservation and was promptly seated in their outdoor area which was outfitted in chairs and tablecloth covered tables.We started out with the escargots gratinée ($17) which was more of a salad with crushed walnuts and escargots nestled atop a garlic buttered toast. I thought the toast was interesting but I do enjoy snails so no complaints from me. For the entrées, we ordered the scallops Provençal ($31) that sadly did not taste too fresh-- the scallops were slightly mushy-- but were basted in so much butter that it was really good. The ratatouille on the side was a nice nod to Provence. I had the roast salmon bearnaise ($27) which came with a braised endive and roasted tomatoes which complemented the fish well. We also ordered the beef short ribs ($30), amazingly filling especially with the mashed potatoes. Overall, I thought the dinner service was quite nice and definitely had a very charming and cozy neighborhood feel to it. I will be returning for a lunch when I'm in the area.

The pita sandwich came with freshly grilled onions, tomatoes, some greens, and one large lamb kebab. Best part of the sandwich was how fresh everything was, showing they that take their quality seriously. It is a tad on the pricey side, which may be the only downside.Overall, would definitely recommend if you're looking for a quick bite that's relatively healthy"

Miznon offers a new kind of Mediterranean street food in Chelsea Market which is an indoor food and retail marketplace.I ordered the Rotisserie Broken Chicken and it came in a pita with tahini, za'atar, spicy green peppers, and scallions. The verdict is in and it was phenomenal. The chicken was absolutely delicious, very tender and full of flavor. Each bite was spectacular and I found myself savoring every morsel.The tahini, za'atar, and spices all blended perfectly with the chicken and added a depth of flavor that was unmatched. The pita was soft and warm, providing the perfect vessel for the delicious fillings. The spicy green peppers added a nice kick, making it a complete and satisfying meal.Overall, I highly recommend Miznon in Chelsea Market for anyone looking for a delicious, casual dining experience.

You can watch the open kitchen slide in burger patties (popular!), ladle in braised meats (my favorite), scoop in their world-famous baby cauliflower (my wife's order), stuff in a fried fish filet, etc. They do a good job of dispersing the ingredients so most of the bits are balanced.The long hot peppers they serve on the side are dangerous! They get way spicier towards the stem.The space is big with tables, counter space, and big seat-like steps lining the side, and it's one of the less crazy-busy stalls in Chelsea Market.

I simply needed to use the restroom and as nice as the workers were and clean the interior was, I became a patron.It is something as simple as the gesture of letting someone use the bathroom, which we've all had positive and negative interactions with store workers over, which may make or break first impressions for potential customers.Thanks God for the crew that took their time out to chat with me afterwards and share some words about how our days are going. It's really nice to be one with the community and I hope we may all move forward in this non-dismissive manner."
1720,RWo0FLTUCNpZLXs3BvzEKw,3/6/2023,2 star rating,They changed the takeout boxes to a much smaller version. The mashed potato tastes better now (more creamy) but corn bread is now spongey and bready. They've started serving quail/pigeon instead of chicken because the bird was tiny.
1721,RWo0FLTUCNpZLXs3BvzEKw,6/7/2022,1 star rating,"Not sure what happened to Boston Market Bay Terrace, before the pandemic the food and service had at least been decent but now it has gone down the drain. I ordered a 1/2 chicken bourbon bbq flavor and a 1/3 dark chicken sweet Thai garlic flavor. What I got was no flavors for both and instead of dark chicken I received white chicken which was very dry. In addition the sides were just not good. The cornbread was not crispy at all but instead soggy. If this was a one time thing where they were extremely busy I would give it a pass but there was a total of four people on this Tuesday Evening. It may have been due to pandemic or what not but Boston Market has had a tragic downfall. I hope other locations will be better."
1722,RWo0FLTUCNpZLXs3BvzEKw,9/28/2022,3 star rating,I've been ordering delivery from this location for a couple of years now.  Always the half white meat chicken individual meal.   Always a decent sized portion with acceptable sides.  The price for this particular meal has increased by $4.00 - a substantial increase.  To add insult to injury the portion size of the chicken has been reduced by almost one half.  I mean come on -- the price increase was bad enough but to offer the measly sized chicken breasts they are now using is a step too far.   I used to be able to make a decent size portion of chicken salad with one breast.  That same portion of chicken salad now requires two breasts.  So they imposed a 25% price increase coupled with a 50% portion decrease.  It's just not worth it anymore.

I went in today to find out that the cream spinach now costs extra. I was going to get a family dinner for four with dessert, around $40. Now you've gone to far and have lost me as a customer because of a two dollar extra charge! It's the principle of the matter. This is an extremely stupid policy. You were great once, no longer.

I was having some trouble choosing what I wanted to order, but I ended up getting the market bowl. I got chicken with sweet corn and the garlic dill new potatoes, which I was craving! I also asked for gravy on the side. The service was pretty nice. As for the food itself, the chicken was kind of dry. The corn was sweet and tasty and the potatoes satisfied my craving but were not flavorful enough. I enjoyed the food and it was filling, but for the price I would not come back again."

It's one of those rare fast food places where there's something on the menu that pleases everybody (as long as you're not pescatarian). Ha ha It's also a bit healthier than other fast food fare.This review is for the Bay Terrace shopping location. The mall only has a handful of food options so when you're marathon shopping like I was this past weekend, the value and speed of getting my meal was a huge factor.Try: the prime rib that's only offered on select days of the week. Currently (April/May 2018) offered on Wednesday and Sunday's after 5pm. Comes plated with a choice of two sides and they give you some ""au jus"" and horseradish sauce on the side. I did use both generously because I wanted to but it didn't need it. I love horseradish so it's just something I do.The Mac and cheese is always a win as are the brownies.Skip: maybe it's this location, not sure but the meatloaf my sister ordered was too mushy and I miss the old sauce. I think it used to be tangier and like a reddish color. It's now served in a gravy like base. Not a fan. Makes the meat too soft and you can't taste the meat, you only taste sauce.The location overall is kept clean and plenty of seats unlike many others I've frequented. Also, the servers were very pleasant and moved the line with efficiency."

We waited in line to order (about 5 minutes) and then grabbed a table and waited about 15 minutes for our food. The foodstuffs they sell in the front of the shop is really fun to browse, if you're trying to kill time. It did feel like a long time to wait for a sandwich, but to be fair, it was a huge sandwich. I didn't get cell service in the restaurant, but luckily they have a (slow-ish) WiFi network that you can hop on for free. I got:- Italian Combo - This was a delightful sandwich. So many ingredients and they combined to make something amazing. Next time, I would get this without the mortadella, but that's just a personal preference. My friend got another sandwich, the name of which I've forgotten, but she also loved hers. My one complaint is that boy is it expensive for a sandwich. Other than that, highly recommend!"

Now there isn't much seating (one 4 seater and 2 at the countertop) so it's better to order to go or for pickup. We ordered the meatloaf and the delight. My favorite hands down was the meatloaf, just enough tomato sauce on the meatloaf and the pickles and peppers give it a tangyness and spicy that makes you want to keep eating more."

I've heard theories that chinese food places use cat instead of chicken and LET ME TELL YOU, it seemed like this was the case LOL . either that or the chicken  was a zillion years old, slowly rotting in their fridge. Not only that but for a chinese food place that is a few blocks from my house, they took 40mins to get here. that is 20 mins too long for me. call me impatient but  I was STARVING. at least i won't have to worry about the calories of the food since i couldn't eat it.YUCK.Never Again."

Most people complain about cashiers being rude and food not being good but I have never experienced this and so I think you all should try it for yourself. There is this cashier there (Jheanell) going by the name on the ticket she looks young no more than 20, and she wears glasses and braces. She is the most manner-able cashier there. Every time I get in she greets me with a smile whilst the others just stand there waiting on me to order. She is very very fast and looks like the most knowledgeable person there. The only problem I have with her is that on the slow shifts she have she looks uninterested, but on the faster shifts she is just there doing her thing. On a Friday evening the place can be packed and in no time u see she cashed out all 30 of us and is just waiting on the food to come around. Sometimes I witness her wash her hands and start sharing food as well. The other cashiers are okay but they are slower and less likeable than that girl. They dont seem to be able to share food so they just stand there doing nothing if they are waiting on the food. The servers are okay. My favorite is Marlon. Whenever sunday morning or Monday evening when him and the cashier with the braces work, I get really good food and FAST. On other days it takes awhile for my food to be shared and then the cashier bags slow. Overall it is okay. The food is definitely authentic Jamaican food."

I have grown up in rough neighborhoods all over queens New York. With that being said, there is absolutely no reason , no rationale for the behavior of the female cashiers at this place.  Nothing justifies their behavior. NOTHING. They talk to the customers as if customers are dogs, you come in there to order food and they act like as if you are doing them a favor by ordering the food that YOU PAID FOR. The disrespectful attitude, to the hissing of the teeth , to the slamming your debit card on the table when they give it back to you. What could these girls have been through to behave like this ? Prison time ? Sexual assault ? Are they traumatized. They forbid you ask a question about their menu. How they are still in business only the devil knows.  If you go to this establishment make sure you are prepared for an argument with one of the female cashiers , ( especially the one with glasses don't know her name ) an argument  filled with profanity.The girl yelled at me and gave me a dirty look because I asked her to put the cabbage in a separate container.  I wake up everyday and treat people with respect , I have been through a lot in life but I know not to take it out on people."

Both times I've been here the same cashier has been nothing but polite, patient and friendly with others and I. I felt sad reading some of the reviews about her as I awaited my meal so I had to address that AND I don't know this lady from a can of paint. The food, especially the pork which is all I've had is heavenly. I've read complaints about the meat to rice ratio but I've never had this issue at any Caribbean food establishment as I  ALWAYS ask for ""just a little rice please"". That's the trick right there, specify what you'd like in your box. You're welcome. The jerk pork was crispy and so tasty. Note well, if you get the sauce it's fiery no rass! Whatever size I get I'm always left with food for a next day. Nb: it's even tastier when re-heated, yes that's possible. Their rice and peas I enjoy and I'm not a fan of rice or peas. It's a small takeaway joint with the queue my second visit out the door. If you're looking for the latest Caribbean dance/cookout /club/concert, they display the usual flyers, newspapers and magazines that you'd find at these spots on one end of the counter. Like it?

Truly a great waiting spot, convenient in this TriBeCa zones. NYLS is just across the street too.I have the standard Ham and Swiss Panini and the promotional Dragon Drink. Again, the space/lack of crowdedness is a real plus. I can be here for the next 4-5 hours without any problems. However, I highly urge the management to install a lot more power outlets. Not only is this an obvious necessity for, dare I say, all customers that dine in, the trend is quite clear where all these customers aggregate at the booth/outlets accessible spots. Why not just invest a bit more and expand such necessity to more sitting areas, i.e. the long bar tables/stools?Adding that, aka keeping up with the trend, would definitely make this specific Starbucks location a comfy atmosphere with its very own trade dress--in oppose to that of the general Starbucks trade dress--vibe."

Pros: they remember your name; they are super friendly towards customers; they have only made a mistake once with my order but I turned out liking what they made me much more than what I asked for (even though it was $3 extra)Cons: the line wraps around quite quickly in this location and it seems they have trouble managing it; I witnessed some staff drama that could have been taken care of in the back, not in front of customers; tables in the back are often sticky and don't seem to be wiped down often; at busy times (8-9, 1-2) it will take 15-20 minutes to receive my order even when I ask for something simpleOverall, this is a good Starbucks if you work or attend class in the area. Even though I like studying in public places, I wouldn't study here because as mentioned, the tables don't seem to be wiped down as often as it should. It also gets pretty crowded so I'd most likely find somewhere else to go and read. It's good if you have time to wait around for your coffee but if you want something quicker I'd recommend perhaps using their mobile app or going to a non-Starbucks location closer."

I understand this is mostly the customers' fault, but the restroom was out of both toilet paper and the seat covers, and there was some mysterious liquid ALL over the floor. Nevermind the stains and pieces of toilet paper stuck to everything. **Price & portion, 3/5** Grande sweet cream vanilla cold brew with extra sweet cream ended up being $6.75. It didn't matter because I used my stars to redeem a drink, but I swear this is almost $2 more than the exact order I get in the Bay Area, California. Why the upcharge?**Taste of the food, 3/5** Cold brew tasted watered down, even with the extra sweet cream.**Other notes** A good amount of indoor seating available."

I was starting to become disappointed with the Starbucks franchise. But the staff here are absolutely friendly and patient. The decor is also very nice. I would come back to this location just for Starbucks. Hopefully the pandemic will be over soon so that we can sit in and enjoy the ambiance.

Again, the space/lack of crowdedness is a real plus. I can be here for the next 4-5 hours without any problems. However, I highly urge the management to install a lot more power outlets. Not only is this an obvious necessity for, dare I say, all customers that dine in, the trend is quite clear where all these customers aggregate at the booth/outlets accessible spots. Why not just invest a bit more and expand such necessity to more sitting areas, i.e. the long bar tables/stools?Adding that, aka keeping up with the trend, would definitely make this specific Starbucks location a comfy atmosphere with its very own trade dress--in oppose to that of the general Starbucks trade dress--vibe."

It wasn't until after my food was paid for and I was too far to ask for my money back, that I saw the horrible pics and reviews. More than one photo shows food with roaches, (including the cover pic!) for this particular Yummy Taco. I did a thorough inspection of my burrito before biting into it, praying that I didn't come across anything with antennae. My food was critter-free but I didn't feel good about eating it. Honestly after seeing pics of food items with insects and shrimps with the black goop unremoved, I'm shocked that this place is still in business.

This isn't the sort of place for food enthusiasts or even people looking for Mexican food. Yummy Taco is one of those uniquely New York take out places that combines Chinese and Mexican cuisines to create something that isn't quite either. It's the Frankenstein monster of food joints. As Hunter Thompson might phrase it, Yummy Taco is "" a high-powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live, and too rare to die.""

It seems clean on the inside and they've really stepped up their décor recently. And by décor, I mean a giant Asian mural of some temple and karate or kung fu fighter posters adorning the walls. I'm on the fence though with how I feel about the food. They use traditional jack cheese on their quesadillas and their meat tastes surprisingly delicious. Get the steak and cheese quesadilla! But it never seems to digest well for me. I also like their fries. But the cheese sauce if you get any comes on the side in a Styrofoam cup. Boo. And its cheese wiz. I've been here once when there was a guy getting arrested for a drug bust also. It's that kind of neighborhood. Take your food to go.Last night I came in for a hankering for a cheese and chicken quesadilla and was disappointed that they gave me a less than half-filled salsa container. :( That's kind of icky. I'm wondering if they didn't fill it up all the way or if they accidently gave me someone's partially used salsa. Guys, you have potential for being a delicious shitty taco joint. But step it up and watch these little things that make me fear for my health. Last note, I'm confused about the pricing. The menu for a cheese and chicken quesadilla said $3 something with some change and he charged me $4. Do they really charge you for tax on a taco? Or is the menu labeled wrong? I'm sorry, but normally if I go into get a crappy taco or Chinese take-out spot and they say on the menu this item is $9.50, they don't charge me $10. But I still have a soft spot for this place because it is 'yummy'."

Today I had an issue with seamless and the order was wrong I was charged for multiple of something I only asked for 1 of on top of missing items. I contacted seamless to correct the matter and they refunded me for the order. Replaced the order. Shortly after replacing the order for the correct items the restaurant calls me and starts being real disrespectful. Telling me I am bad people and flat out being rude!!!! That I only wanted items for free. Why would I want four of one order! It's nachos for crying out loud. Even if you felt something was wrong you still do not call you customer and yell at them. If you had a question or an issue about the refund contact seamless, they are the ones who provided the refund and felt I was correct for what I said. Never doing business with them again."

It was so noticeable that even my boyfriend noticed and later brought it up. We managed to get seats by the bar and gave the bartender our booklets to redeemed our drinks. That was the end of our service. I love a good flavored frozen drink; and it pains me to say that the drink was okay. Maybe the other flavors is where its at? Maybe. We didn't stay long to find out.

A strange but cool coincidence had my sister and her niece in town at the same time. We all are from the SF Bay Area, so it was truly wonderful.My 21-year-niece picked BBC to meet for dinner. It was a wise choice.Although I had eaten earlier, I noshed on some quesadillas and mountain of tortilla chips. We washed it down with some Margaritas. Aye caramba!The food was very good. It was my first time having Mexican in New York. Here in California we are spoiled as there so many types of Mexican cuisine--and most are good to excellent.The service was also good as we nearly closed the joint down, but were not rushed. Nice. I've bookmarked this place in my Yelp app so that I have a Go-To Mexican joint when I'm in NYC."

I went to the bathroom which you have to walk sideways to get inside & out. I came back & grabbed my drink & tipped him then I had a seat outside & waited to be served. The woman who served me was nice & accomodating. I ordered chipotle shrimp chimichangas & the vanilla rum flan. I loved the chimichangas & the flan but the beans were extremely salty & the rice had a funky spice to it that I couldn't put my finger on. The frozen pom margarita wasn't worth its weight."

Food is on point and Pre covid it's a fun atmosphere.You don't have to order on seamless- if you go to Baby Bo's you can order from their website so that's what we did.We ordered 2 Venice beef burritos ($16 each) and an order of guacamole ($9). Normally I put sour cream/hot sauce on mine but it honestly didn't need it as it was so flavorful on its own.It was delivered quicker than we could have imaged (under 20min) and I ate it so quick I didn't even get to snag a picture of the burrito. So yes I recommend this spot.

Hojicha Latte ($8.45) - Some of the best hojicha I've had! Very few boba spots offer hojicha on their menu, so I was excited to see it here. The tea was strong and flavorful, and the boba was perfectly chewy. A must-try!  Taro Bobo ($8.90) - Loved the combo of jasmine tea and taro! The taro puree was mildly sweet and the texture was mostly smooth with small chunks of taro. I recommend mixing the taro puree to make the drink more homogenous. The drink already comes with taro puree and boba, but I also added grass jelly and it really brought everything together. The mixture of textures and flavors was delicious!   Loved both drinks I tried! The tea and boba were fantastic. Aside from the drinks themselves, they have quality cups, which were sturdy, rather than the usual flimsy plastic cups. Highly recommend giving this place a try! Can't wait to come back!"

It was good, but not outstanding."
1920,mr7ySdvwhvjHi8cp93eTAQ,10/22/2022,5 star rating,"TL;DR - Probably one of the best bubble tea shops around the area. A bit pricey for bubble tea (~$7.50 for a drink including one topping), but all drinks comes in large and consider the area, the increase in price is worth it. Also remember to ask for a stamp card (might not do this anymore) or put in your phone number to get rewards, every 9 drinks, you get one free.   Rose Jasmine Green Tea (Left on picture) - Overall, a great drink. Did not taste the rose flavor, but the jasmine flavor is present. I got bubbles included and they were a bit overcooked, but still have the firmness in the center. Got the recommended sugar and ice levels (unsure what it was as they just said regular sugar and ice) and felt it was a good fit with it not being too sweet which allows you to taste the tea flavor.Mango Yakult (Right on picture) - Good flavor, they use real mangoes as opposite to syrup flavor that other shops use. It is very creamy and has a thick consistency. Went with regular sugar and ice and the regular sugar level is good enough as the drink was not too sweet."

I usually go for milk tea but this looked so good I couldn't not.They also offer pup cups which I'm not even sure what they are but if they're anything like their other drinks, I'm sure my dog would love it."

I was walking to get takeout, it was hot out, and I figured, what the heck, let me get bubble tea. This was an excellent impulse. I knew this place was going to be good when I saw all the cups of fresh fruit in the counter case. You can tell that everything is quality and handmade. There were lots of intriguing flavors, but I went with the golden passionfruit, which came with lychee gel and boba. It took a while to make, but given the freshness I didn't mind. Very young crowd inside. Cute storefront.My drink was superb. Some boba tea places phone it in, but not here. This was the best drink I'd had in a while."

The first time I came, I got the Coco Mango, which was delicious and filled with so much good stuff including real mango pieces, coconut pudding, and crystal boba. The second time I went (yes, it was that good I went again), I got the Peach Berry, which was delicious as well. This one was more on the refreshing side compared to the Coco Mango, as it was a bit slushy (in a good way). It had lots of fresh peach pieces in there with some strawberries too. Even with no sugar added, it was sweet enough for me with the natural fruit sugars. Each of these was around $8, which is fine considering the quality of ingredients and quantity of toppings.The place itself is a bit on the small side, but there are a couple nice glossy wooden tables/seats inside. The lady at the counter was friendly and helpful. The service speed is decent.Overall, if you're looking for any type of tea-related drink and you are in the Hell's Kitchen area, this is a great place to visit!"

I had the Four Seasons Oolong Milk Tea and it was really good. It was a bit pricey, but I really liked it. It's honestly one of the best random boba's that I've ever had.

Terremoto Coffee is not some big chain of faceless coffee products, but a more personalized and thoughtful coffee spot. high quality. well-prepared. genuinely friendly. it is a joy to be in the small space inhaling coffee aromas--knowing that joy is distilled into each cup of brew. the Americano here is stellar bc it is a simple coffee drink prepared proficiently and the end result is a flavorful hot cup of coffee. there's not much seating inside the shop but there is some seating outside of it. the staff here is hospitable.  nothing like walking on a crisp Fall afternoon with a cup of coffee of Terremoto to keep your temperature up and rewarding your taste buds with some subtle yet, pleasantly layered flavor in each sip of  coffee."

1930,9-ornJr0G_IHkl6FpcCNzw,1/19/2023,3 star rating,"Honestly, was not too impressed.  I came here because I saw them on Too Good To Go where you can purchase a mystery bag at the end of their business day.  While the bag wasn't the greatest, I was more angered by the service of the worker that day.  They were not very friendly at all, and kind of just brushed me off.  It felt very rude, and not just in the snooty barista kind of way, this felt unwelcoming.  Wouldn't come back again, there are plenty coffee shops in this area."
1931,9-ornJr0G_IHkl6FpcCNzw,3/26/2023,5 star rating,"They have super interesting and quality alternatives to coffee for folks who can't consume caffeine. The barista there is super professional and kind at the same time, so ask him if there is anything if you have a hard time deciding what is good for you! I will definitely revisit it when I am in the hood."

I ordered a space oddity again (latte with rose syrup) and received a regular latte. For a drink that costs nearly 8 bucks, I want what I ordered and am pretty annoyed I basically paid double what a regular latte costs. I didn't get to try it until I was at work and now I won't be able to step out to get this fixed, but it shouldn't have been wrong in the first place. I also tried calling the number listed here and no one picked up. Not sure if I'll be back."
1935,9-ornJr0G_IHkl6FpcCNzw,10/24/2022,5 star rating,Stopped by here for a latte over the weekend. We tried the terremoto latte which had a caramel flavor in it. It wasn't too sweet which I appreciated. I loved the creaminess of the latte and the espresso was very smooth. They had fun live music going on outside. Definitely pricy but would come back to try more of their speciality lattes

My expectations were high just from the appearance of it. The donut looks so fluffy and creamy and delicious. So I went in to purchase one along with a cup of coffee. Total came out to around $11-$12 which is expected for a NY coffee shop and especially a French coffee shop. However, the only thing enjoyable that day was the cup of coffee and the friendly customer service. For a $6 donut it was disappointing. The donut tasted a bit stale and the cream ratio was a bit excessive. The donut tasted like a stale brioche bun. The cream was actually not bad. It was a bit on the lighter side and wasn't too sweet but there was just too much of it. Perhaps I got a bad batch. I might have to skip the French donut next time I try out Le Pain.

1981,dscslnybf6U6T8NNaiQ6lw,6/29/2022,4 star rating,This is our Go To Coffee spot - they consistently make the best in whatever kind of coffee or drink you order - we come here like 3-4X / week taking away a STAR coz lately they are always out of half n half - this is a few weeks or a month now - what's up ???

When I got home to ate it, I sprinkled a little powered sugar on it and it was heaven.The employee was so wonderful and nice while helping me. I wasn't able to catch his name. In any case, I'll be back again!"
1983,dscslnybf6U6T8NNaiQ6lw,10/23/2022,3 star rating,They close at 8 but basically implied that I needed to leave 30 minutes before closing. I've worked in cafes for over 5 years therefore I can attest that this is not a normal occurrence that should occur. I was slightly annoyed over the fact that I was taking an online exam (which I would've competed in 10 minutes from the time I was told I had to leave)
1984,dscslnybf6U6T8NNaiQ6lw,7/4/2021,5 star rating,"Great if you are looking for a regular cup of coffee, something sweet to eat or something on the fancier side. I always go for the nutellaccino with oat milk or a chai.  They also have breakfast sandwiches and pastries, my go tos are the ham and cheese pie or bougatsa(cream pie). They now have outdoor seating which is great if you are not in a rush and want to enjoy your food and coffee. Hands down favorite coffee spot in the neighborhood."

Also, there is food menu with  brunch treats such as eggs Benedict and others. If you are in the area, this is your local ""go to"" place for coffee/ snack fix."
1991,VexbNobbahnCexe693zWCA,2/5/2023,5 star rating,"I'll be forever rooting for this place because they are a neighborhood staple. The line always stretches outside the front door, rain or shine during peak hours but it goes by quickly so don't get off line :) Even with a newer Starbucks opening up across the street, there is no comparison to the quality and value you will get from Coffee Spot Cafe. I have lived here for over a decade and every morning order my chocolate raspberry iced coffee or my French vanilla iced coffee. If you're in the mood for something sweet, the breads and pastries are all made fresh until they sell out and let me tell you, they are all out of this world... the apple cranberry slice, vegan chocolate cheesecake, cinnamon banana walnut bread... the list goes on and on. I've sat and had eggs, sandwiches, salads and soups from here as well and the service is always friendly and the girls at the counter always remember us ""regulars"" and what we order. They are cash only and by all means - good for them. I will happily support them. They're prices are so affordable that you really can't complain about being cash only. Thank you for being such a staple in my life! See you in the morning!"
1992,VexbNobbahnCexe693zWCA,10/30/2019,2 star rating,"This place has super cute decor. So I stopped in to have some soup. Ordered the chicken noodle soup and a Kompote to drink. The kompote had no fruit flavor; more like colored sugar water. The soup took a long time to bring out. I thought it was because trey were microwaving it. Maybe,  but that's not the worst part.  The ""chicken soup"" is really a powered yellow broth with boiled noodles and dill sprinkled on top. No chicken, no vegetables, no resemblance of chicken soup. It was served with 2 slices of dry brown bread. I felt deceived.Wont be back"
1993,VexbNobbahnCexe693zWCA,12/17/2021,5 star rating,After trying this place again it has been great. I recommend checking it out if in the area. They have expanded a bit and it feels great. Amazing bites to eat too. They have grown a lot. Check it out!!!
1994,VexbNobbahnCexe693zWCA,7/4/2021,4 star rating,Still love this place and I love that they are expanding. Hands down best coffee shop pastries I have ever had. Removed one star because we are in the 21st century and it is time to start accepting credit cards! Cash only is super inconvenient.
1995,VexbNobbahnCexe693zWCA,1/9/2022,5 star rating,"It's a unique place but you have to be selective with their food. The soups are great and so are the home made bakery goods, havent tried coffee. Considering this place is run by unsophisticated 20 somethings fresh outta the old world barely standing Ukraine or Belarus I'd say the service is good. I wouldn't order their sandwiches or salads just based on the cleanliness of be place.  I'd visit again the interior looks orderly and welcoming."

They were never the friendliest but that's fine as long as the service was okay. Now, with a pandemic, they should be taking precautions. They don't take temperature. There's a sign saying wear masks but I see many Russian patrons not abiding. I stopped going just for this reason"

Done.I thought this place was spectacular and looks super nice (guess it was recently renovated).Burrito was massive and very tasty - especially for the price I was paying.I'm amazed it doesn't have 5 stars... Maybe my experience was different from others but:-I didn't find it to be bland at all, especially with the salsa they gave me-my burrito was wrapped perfectly (I dropped a total of three grains of rice and used no foil/waxed paper... downed it like a savage too)VERY disappointed in other reviewers making negative comments on the RACE of employees / business owners?!?! Seriously WTF people? We need to be better than that.If anyone has issues with language barriers (I personally didn't), they have numbered paper menus on the counter - just tell them the NUMBER and you'll be good. Plus I think the cashier has to convert your order to the numbers anyway. Just walk in there and say ""B9""  and they'll hook you up with the best steak & chicken burrito you'll get in Manhattan for a bargain price."
1999,EzKvmyYk-7xQZ47Me-NDwg,1/24/2023,1 star rating,This place is horrible. Period. Nearly 15 dollars for a burrito bowl that has half the amount of food & 10% of the flavor as something you'd get at chipotle for 10 dollars
2000,EzKvmyYk-7xQZ47Me-NDwg,8/16/2021,5 star rating,Delicious if you are craving something cheap and quick that feels a bit more authentic than Taco Bell. The crunchy tacos are yum. I highly recommend the guacamole taco. Cheaper than grabbing chips and Guac if you are just craving a bite. The chili taco is supposed to be similar to a ground beef. It's ok. Worth the price. The bean and cheese flour tortilla is a light snack. Like a small soft taco. For $10 I got 3 things. Def going back when I need a takeout craving.
2001,EzKvmyYk-7xQZ47Me-NDwg,6/27/2020,5 star rating,"Today is the first day Taco Today reopened. They reopened with a new look & great taste to the food. I got a Chicken Quesadilla, all I can say is the TASTE is GREAT!!!!!Get your food today."

2005,EzKvmyYk-7xQZ47Me-NDwg,12/30/2020,4 star rating,Don't complain this isn't authentic Mexican if you eat burrito bowls from Chipotle!  I started eating at these Chinese run Mexican places years ago because it was cheap and the food is also very good and filling.  There used to be one every ten blocks or so but now  they're hard to find so happy there is one left in UES. The beef tacos have a nice Smokey flavor and the chicken is thigh meat are seasoned well.  The portions are huge as believe it or not it's cheaper than Taco Bell's where I spent over 10 on lightly filled tacos. The pandemic has made me appreciate the simpler foods you can get delivered or pick up wearing sweats and I'm going to add this place as a place worth saving so keep and open mind and give it a try. Tip: if you're not going to eat their food right away ask them to skip the  lettuce and tomato's which will make it mushy and bland.
2006,EzKvmyYk-7xQZ47Me-NDwg,7/6/2017,3 star rating,"This is an okay takeout place. I wouldn't call it ""authentic"" Mexican, but it really isn't that bad. The steak enchiladas had plenty of cheese (some of it not totally melted). The steak had good flavor, but was very dry. I also didn't appreciate that the salsa was very water-y.They also shorted be $3 change, which I didn't realize until I had gotten home."
2007,EzKvmyYk-7xQZ47Me-NDwg,11/22/2020,1 star rating,I was sick for 2 days after eating here. Very upsetting because I used to like it but I can't take a chance to go back in the future after this experience. Be careful if you eat there cause it's good but risky

A very upsetting experience.  I won't be back to this location.  Also, the floor needed to be mopped.  Ambiance was mid quality due to cleanliness.  2/5 stars as of 1/4/23"

The shop is cute and great for taking instagram pics. There's also a simpsons character outside where you can pose with. I think the drinks here are more for instagram because of the brightness and color. But everything tastes like syrup and the tea quality was not good."

Located on narrow Bayard St in Chinatown, Vivi also carries popcorn chicken and a couple of other savory items. Vivi is super tiny- but packed real good with bubble teas and slushies. Recently visited on a Sunday and was crowded. So crammed- my daughter actually placed the order then waited with me on the sidewalk. Even after all these years, it was only right to come where it all started for me. Prices are slightly high for the size I feel- but the perfectly cooked tapioca pearls is how I remembered them."
2013,WxNlqGSsj_2TCodkx9Sa4A,11/30/2021,5 star rating,"Coffee Jelly Boba and Vivi Signature Fruit Tea. Just...just, perfection. Places like this make me realize how much we're lacking in Charlotte. The great thing about getting both of these to share with someone is that the Coffee Jelly Boba is delicious, rich, and creamy with plenty of milk, yet the Vivi Signature Fruit tea is fresh and bright and vibrant that also acts as a palate cleanser so you can enjoy the Coffee Boba as if it were the first sip again!Charlotte, NC might have one or two Boba tea shops that I would say are noteworthy, but still are way out of NYC's league. I guess I gotta enjoy it while I'm here!"

My party was a little more daring and ordered some of the more ""fancier"" drinks with jellies, which they enjoyed. I will say, service is quick considering we did order like 6 drinks and we were in & out of there quickly. That was definitely a plus since we were in a hurry. It's not a place I would normally seek out but it definitely satisfied my milk tea craving and everyone else's too!"

Very quaint and adorable straw selection as well!"
2017,WxNlqGSsj_2TCodkx9Sa4A,11/25/2020,4 star rating,"Suuuuper tiny storefront. I've been visiting this Vivi location once or twice a month for the last six or so years. My recent visit was the first time since March 2020 and they've renovated! It looks great! Nice that they were able to revamp the place during quarantine and I hope they continue to get business during these times. With the renovation comes some changes. Mainly, the bench with Homer Simpson is gone and I don't think he'll be making a comeback either.ALSO, NEW HOURS OF OPERATION: 12 PM - 6:30 PMThey pared down their counter space for customers and the stools are gone. I personally love that you can't sit down anymore because some people/tourists looove to hang out and clog this tiny store in ye old pre-covid times. Not a negative in my opinion that the seating is gone. This place is too small to have too many people inside at once. Will the bar stools return? Not sure, hopefully not. It's not that big of a deal to begin with.The door has signs posted that let's you know that you need to wear a mask before entering and to remember to keep your distance when you queue up to order. Remember this place is tiny. Anyway, service wise, the girls are nice and they're protected by a plexiglass a the front counter. I've got 0 complaints with this place and brand in general. I frequent their Ave U Brooklyn location much more but I always stop by here if I'm ever in Chinatown which is usually once a month. They've got a nice selection of bubble milk teas, fruit teas, slushee's and snacks. You can't go wrong checking them out. I prefer Vivi over the likes of the other boba stores on this same block because their teas don't taste powdery."

They have a buffet for lunch and they offer soup which is nice during the real cold days. Their hours are good too for those who come into the city early like myself.The staff is also pretty friendly, but the prices can be pretty crazy, almost convenient store like. Be careful with how much you order here. It will add up quickly.If you are looking for one item, then this will turn out well for what it is, a simple deli."

As I walked in, the smell of delicious Jamaican spices and aromas hit my nose and sets off alarm bells in my stomach. This is gonna be good.I desperately ask if they are still selling ackee and codfish. Its my absolute favorite but its never sold past 11am. The friendly guy at the counter checks and thankfully there is some left! I ordered a small portion with boiled potatoes, plantains and dumplings and obviously an orange D&G soda to wash down the goodness. All for $8.50...yes.I opened my container and let the smell wash over me. Theres so much flavor in each bite, I thought I had died and gone back to the Caribbean. Also, it wasnt as oily as some others Ive had which is a plus for me :)If youre ever in the neighborhood, stop by this authentic and fabulous Jamaican gem."

A few minutes later, I was finding street parking and going into Mike's.It's a small place, a few tables but mostly servicing the take out crowd. I looked over the menu and opted for the medium size jerk pork dinner. It came with two pieces of plantain, rice n peas and cabbage. To drink I got a Sorrel Ginger bottled drink. The jerk pork dinner was tasty, not very spicy but filling. I had asked the guy at the counter to give it a good blast of jerk sauce and it soaked nicely into the rice. The Sorrel Ginger drink had a nice sharp ginger bite to it, like authentic Ginger Beer. Overall, 5 out of 10 for the food and drink."

I'm usually there in the morning around 8AM for breakfast, and the service has been incredibly fast. The staff is pretty nice as well, and will strike up conversation with you while you're waiting in line.I usually get the 2 for $4 breakfast sandwiches (two bacon egg and cheese croissants for $4). It's a price that you literally cannot beat anywhere else. Though my wallet is thankful for the deal, my arteries are probably going to be quite unhappy with me in a few years' time.I also recently tried their new French toast breakfast sandwich (it was a sausage, egg and cheese sandwich with French toasts as bread). It was a bit bland, but definitely pretty imaginative as an item. That being said, I can't fault an individual location for serving up something almost certainly pre-made.It's a good place to stop by if you're in a rush on the way to work, and you want a solid, cheap meal."
2041,I-tX4VWJJrrwBQ6E7_wwYw,6/6/2018,2 star rating,Over priced meals. I clearly had a number 4. Small fries small sprite and a bacon king burger. All that came out to 11$ not cool.When I get home from work on Wednesday for some random reason I kept on burping. I go to sleep and I had to wake up in the middle of the night to throw up. I threw up about 6 times I was stomach sick the whole day then yesterday night I was still throwing up about 2 more times. I had to call out from work 2 days in a row. Due to this problem. I believe  the meat on the burger was no good. Be careful with buying burgers here.
2042,I-tX4VWJJrrwBQ6E7_wwYw,2/20/2020,1 star rating,This place is too crowded and someone took my bag of food. I went to get a straw and they took it. When I went to tell an employee they didn't believe. I was like I am not going no where if I don't get my food. This will be my last time at this Burger King.

2044,I-tX4VWJJrrwBQ6E7_wwYw,4/21/2017,1 star rating,"I've had enough of this location. I had an issue with my order a few months ago & received a call from the owner who was very nice. He apologized & offered me a free meal (which I decided not to retrieve). Since then I experienced minor issues which were tolerable but nothing like today. They're credit card system went down & after waiting several minutes, the system was still down & I left empty handed. Not even an apology!!! No manners at all from staff. Moving forward, I will never return back to this store & will take my former loyal customer dollars elsewhere.Manners make a difference as do solutions."
2045,I-tX4VWJJrrwBQ6E7_wwYw,11/27/2018,4 star rating,It's still fast food.  I will say service is polite. I'm not sure if they are still doing the price change thing on the weekends anymore - however during the week if you just want a burger on the run - then this is the place.  It's also very clean given the amount of students they have in their traffic.
2046,dYfJqwaQ0Z-7bPVveG1iQg,11/6/2022,5 star rating,Great 'real' Irish bar(Or at least real NYC/Irish bar). Stopped in for lunch and had a rare burger and a draft IPA...both of which were fabulous. I sat at the bar and was surrounded by the lilt of Irish accents...including of course the barkeep.The service was great and the atmosphere that of a pub. What's not to like!?!
2047,dYfJqwaQ0Z-7bPVveG1iQg,3/30/2023,1 star rating,"Came here for trivia. Menu has higher than normal prices even before trivia starts. When we asked about it the waitress said ""You don't have to stay"" in a nasty voice. They offered a limited menu because its so busy with trivia even though the entire bar area was empty. When we got the bill our group of 4 was charged a 20% gratuity. At a bar. With 4 people. We are pretty sure the waitress added this on herself knowing her service was terrible.We have been to 10 other trivia spots and every single one offers a gift card for 50 dollars and 25 dollars for first and second place. This place offered sutter wine which is 7 dollars in the supermarket.Food terrible and pricey. Drinks terrible and pricey. How do 4 people buy 2 drinks each and get 2 appetizers for the table and spend 200 dollars?We will never come back here again."
2048,dYfJqwaQ0Z-7bPVveG1iQg,10/15/2022,2 star rating,I rarely give anywhere less than 3 stars. But honestly the service here was terrible. They forgot a drink order and a food order. This was on top of already taking an excessively long time to bring out both food and drinks. While the wait staff was generLly pleasant they were pretty nasty when we asked to fix the wrong charges on our bill. Drinks were fine and the food was just ok. (With the exception of the cheese curds). But I have absolutely no desire to return.
2049,dYfJqwaQ0Z-7bPVveG1iQg,2/2/2023,3 star rating,I stopped here for what I hoped would be a quick to go lunch. I put my order in online and when I got there I still waited 30 minutes to get my order.  When I got there no one acknowledged me for quite a while and I asked to pay while waiting to save some time but they also didn't follow up on that.  So then I was left rushing around to get back to work and eat in time.  I ordered the Buffalo chicken wrap with fries. It was OK. Definitely not my favorite. It had huge chunks of celery in it. Which I don't typically mind but they were so big it was a little overwhelming. The fries were good though!

It had great ambiance, fair prices, great food and drink, and the laid-back atmosphere we were hoping for to watch the game and have a few drinks. The staff are all so kind and attentive. Our server didn't miss a beat when refilling our drinks and bringing out our food. It was a great experience, and it's in a great location. I definitely recommend this spot if you're looking for something low-key and relaxed. We loved that it wasn't too loud or playing thumping music like some of the other bars we passed by."

2052,dYfJqwaQ0Z-7bPVveG1iQg,12/5/2020,5 star rating,"A safe haven in the pandemic! Your typical Irish pub: warm, welcoming and good food/beer. We had been here a few times pre-pandemic and have always been huge fans. But wow, the wings have always been amazing. Super crispy and wonderful. Beer is cheap and plentiful. I'm not even a big beer drinker and I had the Murphy's Law Red Ale which was awesome. Entrees and dinners here are always surprisingly good not to mention the super friendly staff and waiters. There are so many TVs with all the current sports games on both in and outside now! What more could you ask for?! The management here is going above and beyond to comply with all the current Pandemic Regulations. I'm so happy to see a spot doing everything they can during these though times. They've invested in heaters outside which you can actually feel! My husband and I had a great little evening here. We dined outside but the inside is also so beautifully decorated with garland and lights for the holiday season. If you're looking for a night out at an Irish bar and restaurant without the massive crowds, this is your spot! Can't wait to go back again soon."
2053,dYfJqwaQ0Z-7bPVveG1iQg,12/6/2019,3 star rating,"Three stars here means decent bar experience. We were a little disappointed in the quality of the pub food, however.I love pub and tavern food. Murphy's Law wings were a little dry, not juicy. The Shepherd's Pie was also just ok, not the superblast cozy comfort food wow that you get at some other taverns when you order Shepherd's Pie. Bartender was extremely nice, however. Old Fashioned Cocktail was A plus. The Guinness from the tap was amazing. When you get a Guinness that has been properly managed, the taste and creaminess are unbeatable. That was the case here.Big TVs dominate the scene. So if you are looking to watch a game and have a perfect Guinness, this place fits that bill perfectly."

Pros: - Delicious food and drinks, we went to their Norfolk Street location often and this location is just as good with an even better space. Love and recommend the Crab Taquitos Ahogados, Steak Huarache, Hanger Steak a La Parrilla, Fish Tacos, Enchiladas De Camarón, and Crab Taquitos Ahogados. I love their Passionfruit Margarita - Large fun and festive space perfect for brunch, dates, and celebrations. There's a semi-private room (with an en-suite bathroom) in the back that can easily sit 16 guests, which is where we sat. During our dinner, there were 3-4 other bdays happening- For large groups you're required to partake in the four-course prix fixe menu: Guacamole and nachos for the table, followed by an appetizer, main course, and dessert. The price is $50 per person, plus tax and gratuity. Drinks are separate and are à la carte. You choose four dishes from the ""Para Empezar"" menu and four dishes from the ""Plato Fuerte"" menu to create your prix fixe menu. - They include a custom-printed menu which is a nice touch -  Great service, everyone was so attentive and friendly My friends enjoyed the ambiance, food, drinks, and we left happy and full. Thank you for a wonderful evening!"

The night we were there it took a little time to get our second round of drinks and had to flag down our waiter but it was a busy night!Their margaritas are so freaking good. My husband loves the steak tacos, i love the fish tacos. Their nacho platter is huge. Guacamole also delicious. We've never had a bad thing at La Contenta!"

We were here for dinner and ordered the nachos, the chicken and fish tacos and the chille releno and all were yummy! It's not the best Mexican I have had but it's a very good alternative.

We didn't get any appetizers, but we each chose a drink from the menu - there are lots of great choices! My friend and I both ordered the Chile Relleno, and we both agreed it was really good. It was cooked to perfection and the flavors were great. It also had a really nice spice kick to it. My boyfriend got the Birria de Res, and he said it was really good, but it only came with two tacos, so he basically had to eat most of it like soup. Not sure if they forgot to give him a third taco, or if the dish just comes with two. Overall, we had a great time and the food was really good."

To my surprise it was a pretty busy place that evening I haven't heard much of this place but I do like Mexican cuisine.We ordered guac and chips for the table. I ordered a shrimp enchilada as my main. The guacamole was served in a bowl that already had a few chips in it, along with another smaller plate of chips. The chip to guac ratio was very off and we ended up having to ask for more chips every time, which isn't a bad thing but the service was definitely a bit below average. Our server returned to our table once every rare occasion. It seemed more of an understaffed issue since our server was one of two or three servers working the packed restaurant. The shrimp enchilada was not bad. In summary. The food is about average. Drinks are not bad here. Service could use a bit improvement but that probably lies more with a staffing issue."

2066,elYM_Q52kprd1DYN3ty3rA,10/7/2022,4 star rating,"This review is for the food court only.The dishes here are honestly pretty dang good, surprisingly given that it's a furniture store. The meatball portion is very generous since they give you like 13 meatballs, some mashed potato, and veggies. The veggies didn't taste very fresh but the meatballs with the sauce was very good. You can hard pass on the strawberry ice cream - the texture was so weird that it didn't really resemble traditional ice cream at all.Also, the prices were actually pretty cheap for all the meals you can get here."
2067,elYM_Q52kprd1DYN3ty3rA,11/5/2022,2 star rating,"New rating descriptions on Yelp indicate that 2 stars means ""could've been better.""  That's exactly how I felt about IKEA's restaurant in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, which is nothing like Brooklyn Heights.  Red Hook is a rawer part of Brooklyn, and NYC, that is gentrifying and getting hip.  It is on water and affords views of Manhattan and Upper New York Bay.  That said, this IKEA is in this general area and also on the water.I wish they'd bill this listing as IKEA Restaurant.  It's the categorization that led me to the this listing and most people are correctly putting their restaurant reviews here.An IKEA (Restaurant) almost always starts with 3 stars.  That's because, at the very least, it's predictable, reliable, and a good value.I went in right before closing time after being on the waterfront at Red Hook at the pier facing the Statue of Liberty and Governor's Island, and next to a field that is a dog park.  I got delayed in eating.  That's because there are usually cool people and rambunctious dogs at dog parks.It looks like IKEA's main platters have gone through the typical reshuffling.  I know it's NYC, but I didn't feel like dropping $10 for a small slab of their salmon.  I can do that at Denny's.  So, I noticed a chicken option on the menu board.  It looked nice and round in the photo, so, being tired and hungry, I didn't ask any questions.  It was a bone-in thigh.  The bottom line is that I couldn't salvage much chicken from it, and it took some work, like all bone-in chicken does.  A boneless chicken breast would have been nicer and has often been what IKEA offers.  It came with a vegetable and, by the end of the evening, the vegetables had gotten a little colder.  I saw those vegetable medallions I like.  (I've complained about their price of $1.99 on some other IKEA review, because that's the price for each one!) I asked if I could swap out the vegetable for a vegetable medallion.  It's not handled as an upcharge, but like you were buying one outright.  I'm telling you ... these vegetable medallions are bank for IKEA.  Overall, my main platter and accompaniment came in at about 2 stars.I did like the slice of strawberry shortcake.  It was $2.49, if I recall, and it was very good.  I'd say 4 stars for that item.  I've come to find that the dessert section at IKEA is probably the most reliable part of the eating experience.I glanced at the soup and salad.  They didn't look too appetizing.  But it's nice that you can get free coffee or tea with your IKEA card.The employees were pleasant enough.  One restaurant employee helped me find an outlet for a phone camera that had been working overtime for the preceding few hours.  The security lady at the entrance was also very helpful in telling me where to go ... no, not that kind of ""where to go.""The other reason for the 2 stars is a level of unkemptness in the restrooms and escalators not in working order.  This isn't what you'd expect in what is supposed to be a bastion of Nordic orderliness.This IKEA is supposedly accessible from Manhattan by a ferry they own.  It sounds like they sometimes run it for free and, at other times, it requires a fare.  I had an MTA card and the subway comes close enough to IKEA.  I used the Smith and 9th station.  I don't know if I'd recommend walking the remaining distance.  I took the short bus ride ... albeit on a regular sized bus.  I believe they also have a shuttle from that subway station.  Also, a ""local"" can easily drive and park here, despite New York City's narrow expressways with 3 lanes in each direction and not much in the way of a shoulder.  The store is raised such that parking is available under most of its entirety.  I'm glad I took the subway and, at this point in Brooklyn, the station is an elevated one.  I was able to get some great views looking back toward Manhattan.  Not only that, the lyrics from Rod Stewart's ""Downtown Train"" were going through my head and the whole experience was more ""true to form"" NYC than having driven or taken a private ferry to indulge in its typically value priced cafeteria food."
2068,elYM_Q52kprd1DYN3ty3rA,1/30/2023,3 star rating,"Obviously IKEA is known for their furniture and whatnot but the cafeteria is a nice break in between shopping. I think their Swedish meatballs are fairly good and you can choose I believe 8, 12, or 16 meatballs. The peas are the worst part of the meal and I personally don't like the jam, I tend to eat it with just the mashed potatoes, gravy and meatballs. The chocolate cake was a nice addition and all fairly cheap. Drinks seem to never be in stock though which tends to be annoying each time I visit."

Absolutely love going there and had not been there since before COVID. I went there with my daughters to just window shop and walk through the Marketplace...ended up with a bag of Knick knacks and a whole dresser! The aesthetics are always inviting and increases the motivation to look at all the new things that have in stock. There has been some remodeling in the store which added to the ambiance of the unplanned shopping adventure. If you are looking to do some remodeling or improvements you need to check out IKEA, will not be disappointed!"

The salmon dish was amazing to the point where I even ate the lemon. Very impressed considering it is a home goods store.

2072,elYM_Q52kprd1DYN3ty3rA,9/3/2022,4 star rating,"The closest IKEA option to the city and still takes over an hour or so to get to. You have two options to travel there. On weekends take a FREE water taxi from the city with stops at Pier 79 (40th & 12th Ave) and Pier 11 (Wall St.). From Pier 79 it takes approximately 40 min to reach. Cruise along the Hudson in this two story boat and see views of Freedom Tower and Statue of Liberty. The first boat departs at 10:30am from midtown (pier 79) and last departure back is 5:05pm. The other option is taking the subway to Brooklyn and then waiting for the free shuttle that takes 20 min to reach IKEA, which might be daily. If you take the boat on the weekend it'll save you time and it's free! Go shop and get off at either stop on your return. The store is always busy on a weekend and expect lines early in the famed cafeteria. Being that it's cheap food and not much else around there, a great option to dine while you shop. There is also fast food sold after the check out area. To make things run smoother, they installed kiosks to order and then pick up at the counter. This looks like it's helped lines move faster. Happy they offer veggie dogs now too! Whether you plan to buy much or not, hop on the ferry and enjoy the ride there. Grab the famed Cinnabons and take a walk through the store. Restrooms and elevators available."

The beverage of choice was raspberry sparkling and the still lingonberry- delicious and refreshing.  They do have free still water and ice.

Gordon Ramsey once said if the menu is long, run! But this place is an outlier cause normally it's true, longer menu = not fresh food. But I adore this place. I catch myself craving it once in awhile. I usually order their sushi cause it's actually the best quality around this neighborhood. My husband and I usually order over the phone and the nice lady will give us a pickup number. We normally order the sushi sashimi platter and a random item or two. Their fish is fresh and presentation is good. They have some expensive fish items on their menu like bluefin tuna and uni bowls. They also have a lot of cheaper alternatives like their sushi party trays."
2080,2txI-FAVf7q0SHNPcnjm7Q,11/9/2022,2 star rating,Food here is mediocre at best. I tried the sushi platter b $42 and it was underwhelming. It has two rainbow rolls and eel cucumber rolls or spicy salmon and scallops on top. The rolls fell apart. The spicy scallops taste good. The rest just didn't taste fresh. Try ninja on 86 street. It's much better. The fish balls and rice rolls $7 was good and so were the tripes. The pearl noodles $10 that's stir fry was a little hard. I would just stick with the classic Cantonese dishes here. At this time it is take out and cash only.

We ordered the Salmon Feast and four rolls (two spicy salmon california, spicy scallop california, and eel cucumber) to-go. Service was relatively fast but can be improved as the staff member did not take the initiative to ask if we were ready to order. It is not our first time ordering from Longevous Joy and for the longest time, we felt that the quality of the food is average. However, the food that we ordered this time is mediocre at best. The rolls used to be made with imitation crab meat, cucumber, and avocado. Now, the rolls are made with imitation crab meat and cucumber only. Prices continue to increase but cannot be justified by the quality of the food."
2082,2txI-FAVf7q0SHNPcnjm7Q,8/1/2022,3 star rating,A year later and they still seem to be at a 3 stars for me. Ordered takeout here a week ago and was excited to see that they offered omakase at such an affordable price.. decided to give it a try and I don't recommend the $38 one because the uni and salmon roe over rice was terrible I might settle for sushi flight or Tsukuba market sashimi next time.. was quite dissapointed about that since this is one of the few places in Brooklyn that I trust my raw sushi with. The seared toro was delicious along with most of the sushi just the sides were terrible. They have added a lot of items to their menu and their takeout menu is like a book now. I do recommend the egg drop beef noodle that one is really good.

2087,wTCR-EUTLX4UoPUPdxWVJg,3/19/2023,5 star rating,"Although Blend has other locations (Astoria, by the water) my go to will always be their LIC location on Vernon blvd.  The vibe, music, friendly staff, and absolutely delicious PR fusion food is top notch.  Bathrooms (2 gender neutral) are kept clean which is very much appreciated. They have specials Monday - Thursday; I went on a Monday night and took advantage of their Monday all night happy hour drink specials ($7 per drink).  My group and I had their sangrita and mojitos.  Sangrita is a frozen mix of the margarita and sangria, one drink you are good, two drinks, who knows where the night will lead!  As far as food, my o my their dishes are great.  We got the chicken tenders/fries and Mango juice off the kids menu for our little one.  The fries were string fries, crunchy and good flavor.  The chicken tenders were good too and the Mango juice got rave reviews.  We got a chicken empanada from the appetizers, although on the smaller size for a $4 empanada, it is full of flavor and comes with a tasty dipping sauce. Main dishes we went with the vegan bowl ($12), arroz con pollo ($17), and pollo a la plancha ($19).  Some of their prices increased from the last time I came, but their portions and flavor stays consistent (which not all restaurants stay true to).  Everyone gave two thumbs up for their meals and as usual, I absolutely love the pollo a la plancha; rice, beans, maduros, and a breast of chicken sliced and covered in a kick ass lemon butter sauce.  My group surprised with a birthday flan, they gobbled it up and it had whipped cream drops around the plate. Obviously I still recommend this spot for anyone looking for a good time with great drinks and even better food."

2089,wTCR-EUTLX4UoPUPdxWVJg,3/26/2023,3 star rating,"The service here is exceptional and while some of the foods are delicious, some are not so much. We were a party of 17 and had a reservation so we had a prefix menu with all their most famous options and appetizers. From the appetizers the Maduros and the chicken chunks and empanadas are good. But the calamari is bland and soggy. As per the meal, the churrasco is amazing but the pernil is super greasy (full of fat) and the tilapia is bland. The desserts are not the best- the flan was horrible, the chocolate cake was horrible and the bread pudding was okay. As far as drinks go, stay away from them because they're all bad. The mojitos, the mule, the pina coladas, the rum punch. I kept changing my drink each time in hopes of finding one that was good and none hit the mark. The server was amazing so at least there's that!"
2090,wTCR-EUTLX4UoPUPdxWVJg,12/23/2022,4 star rating,"Came for drinks with a friend on a weekday Thursday shortly after work. I believe on Thursdays they have $7 martinis and was shocked to find out they had lychee martinis. These were so good, the place wasn't super packed and my friend and I were able to catch up. He got some food and said it was pretty decent but I think $7 martinis were such a good deal. I wish they had their HH prices and deals online though."
2091,wTCR-EUTLX4UoPUPdxWVJg,6/24/2022,5 star rating,"I was in the area and came here based on a recommendation by a friend. I had checked out their menu online and scanned my choices, all of which were very tempting. I decided on the Queso de Cabra Salad with grilled chicken and avocado. The salad composed of mixed greens, spicy pecans and crispy goat cheese with a sherry vinaigrette. The grilled chicken appeared to be seasoned with some kind of pesto- looking marinade and the goat cheese was deep fried. The meal was packaged in a plastic container within a very durable bag- the kinds that your mom thinks is a ""good bag"". The meal itself, carried well to my other destination and was one of the best salads I have had in a very long time. The portion appeared to be small, but was $13 and supremely filling. My only complaint was that since they have amazing food and the places was PACKED for a Friday afternoon at 1pm, order your food earlier. Despite preordering, I was waiting there for about 20 minutes because the cook was backed up. However, the wait staff is incredible and they even offered me a free can soda for the extended wait time. It was honestly a VERY nice gesture considering. Therefore, I am leaving by them 5 stars. I can not wait to come back to experience their full dinner service!"
2092,wTCR-EUTLX4UoPUPdxWVJg,1/17/2023,5 star rating,"I've been to all 3 Blend's in Queens, and the best culinary experience you will have by far is at Blend LIC. The vibe is more family oriented which I love! The food is absolutely delish and their chef ROCKS! The food is consistently good and the portions are generous. I've tried their camarones al ajillo app, churrasco, lomo saltado, pollo a la plancha, and most recently I tried the paella. Literally everything on their menu is a must try! The camarones come with nice fresh warm toasted bread which is great for dipping it in the delicious sauce! The service is always wonderful as well! A special shout-out to the Manager, Roberto! He was super attentive as there was an issue with my reservation and he quickly was able to accommodate me, which I greatly appreciated! The bartenders Joselito and Brian served us delicious and strong drinks - I've tried the passion fruit mojitos and their margaritas, and both were just the right amount of sweetness. Recently I made my own drink and had a mezcal Manhattan which was amazing (see pic!). The lovely hostesses Justice and Melissa were both very professional and kind, and our server Keilah Marie was attentive and accommodating. The Busser, Servando,  constantly refilled our water glasses and he definitely contributed to the excellent experience we had at Blend! A big THANK YOU to all the staff at Blend LIC for delivering a wonderful all-around experience to your customers! I hope your bosses know how lucky they are to have you :) Looking forward to seeing you all soon! Cheers ~Susan"
2093,wTCR-EUTLX4UoPUPdxWVJg,10/3/2022,5 star rating,"I highly recommend this place. Our server name is Jenna, she was super friendly, attentive and helpful.  She ensures our time there was great and we enjoyed. For drinks we tried a variety but my absolute favorite was the Fiery dragonberry mojito. If you like sweet this is the choice for you. For appetizer we got the short rib arepa and the chicharron de pollo skewers. Oh my gosh@ they both were amazing. Especially those skewers! Absolute must try. For meals we got the Churrasco steak topped with shrimp and the Arroz con marisco  those were delicous too. We finished the night with a mix of desserts and they all were delicous too. You can't go wrong with anything on the list. I definitely can't wait to return."
2094,wTCR-EUTLX4UoPUPdxWVJg,10/15/2022,4 star rating,"This is a great casual Latin-fusion cuisine eatery situated on bustling Vernon Blvd in Hunters Point. Reservations aren't required and walk-ins are welcome. Came in at 8pm on a Saturday night and only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. Casual atmosphere with seating inside and outside in a covered area on the street. The food was reasonably priced and the food was pretty good. I had the tilapia, a side of chips and guac, and a Patronjito cocktail (very boozy). For dessert, we ordered the chocolate cake, which was a bit underwhelming to be honest. The service was a bit on the slow side because there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant (for both inside and outside seating) on a Saturday night and she was stretched pretty thin. She had a great attitude and was very nice though. She even both single-handedly presented a birthday cake and sang a Happy Birthday song (in a bright-eyed, very chipper way) for the table next to us.  All I know is: Whatever they're paying her, it's not enough. Overall, I enjoyed eating here and will definitely be coming back for more casual nights out in the neighborhood.  I just hope that they hire another person to help out with serving on busy weekends."

Bosses nowadays feel that because of their positions, that they can get away with allowing misbehavior if they choose. Conflict resolution should be practiced with the intention to find the solution and pointing out and focusing on problems only perpetuates the problem."

2144,_WD-5-QpxTpOkRIBfrspdA,1/8/2023,2 star rating,I was in the mood for ramen and my usual places were not accepting online orders. I ordered from this restaurant and simply hoped for the best. The broth was meh (taste was so so and some of it spilled during delivery because it was hot and I think it warped the container) and there wasn't enough broth for the noodles. The pork pieces were dry and chewy and tasted like the pork in your pork fried rice. I ordered 2 boba teas (strawberry and taro). The taro was much better and the strawberry one was overly sweet. The ramen was $18.95 (rip off). The teas were $6.75. Not work the price whatsoever.

Great for a date night, especially catering to their pretty big loyal customer base of couples who were married there, including us...WEDDING: My wife and I got married at BK Winery in 2022, and by golly they delivered. -The staff is experienced, attentive, and great at catering to couples and their family and friends. This ranges from their kitchen staff, the servers, the coordinators and managers, and every other person down to the coat check guy. -The food at our wedding, served French-style, was wildly popular, with some of our guests claiming it some of the best wedding food they've ever had. -The decor and ambience are wonderful for an urban wedding, especially the green wall and skylight. Structurally speaking, the humble façade and the too elongated main room are not perfect, but it makes me excited that they're moving to a bigger building next month.

The second I stepped foot into the ceremony room I was in awe. The room was breathtaking. The attention to detail was impeccable. I think everyone who walked in here was speechless and had to take a moment to look around and take it all in. The staff was lovely from start to finish. The wedding coordinator, I think her name was Lizzie, was just amazing. She is an absolute professional and was really on top of her game from the moment we walked in. The winery had a back room that remained private for the bridal party, absolutely clutch considering we had several purses and things that we were able to keep up there and grab when needed. There was a bigger back room that was open to the wedding guests where they had an additional bar and cocktail food. It was so nice for people to have multiple different rooms to go into throughout the wedding. The ceremony was perfect; romantic and whimsical, like I said, magical. Once the ceremony finished people moved into the main room where the bar was for cocktail hour while they transformed the ceremony room into the dining room. The bartenders were fantastic. Quick and friendly. We were able to utilize the front outdoor space with hanging lights because the weather was so beautiful despite it being an October night. The cocktail hour food was money. Cheese, meats, passed hors d'oeuvre that people are still raving about days later. When they opened the doors to invite us to our tables for dinner, we were stunned all over again. The tables were gorgeous. The flowers on the table, the candles, the plating, just everything was an absolute dream. Everything was served family style. Appetizer was a fall salad, incredibly fresh and tasty. Entrees were a mix of fried chicken, a pasta dish and the juiciest steak I have ever had in my life. Staff would walk around with huge platters and serve guests whatever they wanted. The quality of the food was unlike anything I've had at a wedding before and I have been in a LOT of weddings. The flow was perfect. After dinner it was time to dance. The dance floor is smaller than what I'm used to but sort of in the best way because everyone was close together dancing, laughing, singing and it brought everyone together. People could be on the dance floor, outside, in the upstairs back room or back at their table in the dining area. There was plenty of room for everyone. There is not one thing I would have changed about this venue or the staff. It was truly the perfect day celebrating my sister and new brother and I highly highly recommend the Brooklyn Winery to anyone and everyone for a wedding and also for dinner and drinks. Just fantastic. Thank you all!"

I feel like overall you shouldn't be able to have as many people there as they say because it gets really really crowded and loud. Also the chairs in the dining room aren't very comfortable and it feels very separate and far away from the dance floor even though it's not. The food was good and I liked the family style playing but by the time I got my food it was slightly cold. The charcuterie board and drinks were amazing. The place has a great lay out and bar."

I've been to A LOT of weddings and this one (besides my own wedding) had the best food!  The cocktail hour passed h'ors d'oeuvres were quite tasty. My favorite were the mini grilled cheeses. When we were seated we had a salad then came all of the entrées! It was an interesting setup that the dining part was in a separate room than the dance floor but right after eating all of the guests were on the dance floor.  I loved that it was family style and we got to try everything. I enjoyed the brussel sprouts and smashed red potatoes. The entrees were salmon, steak and buttermilk fried chicken. I was so full I could only have one piece of each but it was delicious! I'd love to go back here for dinner! The bartenders were very attentive. During dinner I ordered a drink from a server which they said we could do instead of going to the bar each time we wanted a drink. I never got my drink and ended up having to go to the bar to get it after 15 minutes...I guess they must've forgotten.

Since we had a rainy day in the city yesterday we wanted to do something indoors that would also practice social distancing and this place really was perfect! We weren't quite sure if reservations were required so we called and asked if there was any availability and to our surprise they allowed us to just walk in! As soon as we walked in, they asked for our names and relevant details and took our temperatures which made me feel very comfortable knowing they're taking the proper measures during this time with Covid going on. The entire staff was wearing masks properly which I also appreciated. The customer service here truly is impeccable since our waitress made us feel very welcomed and even provided us with her top red wine recommendations since it was our first time there! She suggested we go with the Malbec and we ordered half a bottle which to our surprise came in a graduated glass beaker which really reminded me of my college and high school lab days haha (this was actually a cool touch)! Our waitress would refill our water and wine glasses and somehow would pour each wine glass so perfectly even that my boyfriend picked up on it!The ambiance here is truly beyond words since its beautifully decorated with romantic candle lighting, antique plates, wood tables, and wood accents that gave you a homey yet upscale vibe... Not only did I fall in love with the ambience but the Malbec wine we ordered was truly one of the best red wines I've ever had! The scenery here really gave me that romantic and intimate date night feel where I could share some excellent wine and conversation with my boyfriend. Not to mention we ordered the French fries that were actually extremely DELICIOUS and the perfect sharing dish that both my boyfriend and myself were obsessed with! I would totally recommend this place to couples/friends/ family, this place deserves a 5/5 rating! Will be coming back for sure!"

My one complaint (and I understand this is partially a decision made on the couple's part) is that even in pre-COVID times, this location felt very, very cramped, no matter what room/part of the wedding we were in. In pre-COVID times, it would have been merely annoying to bump into someone every time you turned around, but with COVID, it was incredibly uncomfortable, and I wound up leaving early.As mentioned, it's a beautiful space, but we needed a reduction in people of at last 20%."
2173,2cqg0qGfC6bEC1AKGazSXg,6/22/2020,3 star rating,"I haven't ordered from here for a while and so figured i would. I ordered the ""lemon flavored pork chops"" with rice and beans as well as sweet plantains. The price was pretty decent actually and the order was delivered within 30 minutes. When the food arrived, we opened the bag and noticed that they did not send beans with the order. So we called and asked about it. We were told it will take an hour or so for our beans to arrive. The place is about a 7 minute drive from us. They committed the error but we have to pay the consequences. I was beyond annoyed and said ""forget  it"" because clearly I didnt feel appreciated as a customer. They also said ""remind me next time and we can send more beans"". I mean did they really think we would order again from them? And what will reminding them about it on a future order do for us at the current moment? Smh. So we made our own beans which defeated the purpose of ordering in. The pork chops were small and had NO lemon flavor as detailed on the menu. It came with what appeared to be a sad attempt at a side sald which contained 2 slices of cucumber, a grape tomato sliced up 3 ways and a few strands of lettuce. The pork chop was a little over cooked with several parts being inedible due to being burned. The rice was moist and tasty. The sweet plantains were very good. Soft and sweet as well as cooked properly. In all i have to give my review 3 stars because the main attraction was the pork chops that left little to be desired. They were small in size, over cooked and seasoned differently than advertised. Add the inconvenience of having to make our own beans because they forgot to deliver it and told us it would be an hour for a small order of beans and there you have the rating. Will I buy from again? Probably not as there are so many other options in my area for similar food."

I even had leftovers for the next day too!The price was $14 (shocked initially) but well worth it!On a Sunday, no one could help over the phone in english. A patron helped.

One person maybe got their meat first, another person maybe got their rice first or even just their beans and STILL had to wait 20-30 minutes for the rest of the food. So not worth it. The food was bland. I didn't pay for the meal, fortunately but I would have left if it weren't my sisters in-laws who were supposedly friends with the employees!

They take a single entree and divide it into two, passing it off as 2 for the price of 1. We ordered chicken and fries. One order came with 4 nuggets and the other with 5. Both had Minimal fries. What's the point? I personally think it's dishonest and false advertising. We also ordered the daal fry. It was too oily and tasted weird. I she  been eating daal fry for over 4 decades. Trust me..I know my daal. I felt a bit queasy afterwards. I was not sure where this was leading but I didn't want to find out. So I threw it out. Anyway, we did the BOGO for the biryani a few days ago. Same song. One whole entree divided into two masquerading as a buy one get one free. I believe this place under new management and has a new staff. Hence, the downhill slide in quality.  I ordered to avail of the 2 for 1 deals but in the end I found it just wasn't worth it. There are better options for Indian than Spice kitchen. Listen, if you are going to promise something, please deliver! This is just outright lying.Needless to say, me and spice kitchen have had our last hurrah together. Won't order again...ever."

Fellow Yelper, hope you read this review in time before you put in that $55+ order. 1) Their Malai Kofta now is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DISHES. I saw in another Google review that someone else also had this experience. They are shockingly different.2) The chicken tikka masala tonight tasted like it was floating in Campbell's tomato soup. The consistency and flavor were literally the same as canned soup.3) The chicken is hard and chewy, as if it had been frozen.4) The samosas were absolutely disgusting and smelled like an old freezer.5) The cilantro chutney was horrible and tasted nothing like cilantro chutney the two times we've ordered before from here.Indian takeout is expensive (often over $50 for two people), and wasting money on food with this level of inconsistency is unacceptable. The new owners knew this and purposely duped Spice Kitchen's old customers. I never leave one star reviews, but this one sent me. Goodnight y'all, hope you go out of business."

I use that word knowing how intense it is, but some of what we ordered was completely inedible, some of it tasted rotten, and much of it was simply poor Quality, using cheap ingredients. The packaging and portions are also different. The mango Lassie was disgusting, it tasted like thye purposefully used sour ingredients that has gone bad. We immediately threw this out to avoid getting sick. The samosa chat had more chickpeas than samosa and they were hard and undercooked. The samosas themselves, as well as the mint and tamarind chutneys and the yogurt sauce were all bland. We also ended up throwing this away. The basmati rice had huge chunks of cardamom pods that are extremely unpleasant to bite into without knowing they are there. The chicken momos were the strongest menu item that we ordered but their presentation has completely changed and they don't look like any Momo I have seen personally. They also came with no sauce. Perhaps the most egregious menu item was my shrimp tikka masala. What I received was a bland Curry devoid of spice or flavor, with criminally small salad shrimp. If you have ever ordered Chinese American takeout and gotten shrimp fried rice or shrimp lo mein, you know the very tiny salad shrimp that I'm talking about. These were even smaller than that, and for an $18 entree it's criminal to charge prices for garbage. These miniscule shrimp were dry and rubbery, completely inedible and almost hilarious in the fact that they were being presented as real food. Adding insult injury the food was lukewarm by the time it arrived because it was late, but the restaurant never updated their delivery times on their app. It's obvious that spice kitchen is no longer invested in service or quality, I would avoid this at all costs. Customer service, quality of food, and price points are all abysmal right now."

Excited, I placed my usual order with them only to receive less than half their usual portions. Their chicken chow mein looks and tastes like broken spaghetti in spicy canned tomato sauce with bits of undercooked/raw meat. Just got off the phone with a manager at this once fine establishment and received no response for why their chow mein looked and tasted the way it did. I had to clarify multiple times that this was the same Spice Kitchen as before their hiatus. They will in all probability not last long. This is heartbreaking and disappointing. Clearly there has been a complete overhaul of their kitchen staff and their new chefs have no idea what the hell they're doing, so I absolutely cannot recommend this place anymore. Please stay away!"

I hadn't ordered here in the recent few months so I decided to get something to celebrate my Friday evening. So I ordered a chicken biryani. But to my surprise, it's nothing like what I had before. As a matter of fact, it doesn't even taste like chicken biryani. It was basically saltless rice fried in excessive oil and they didn't even use boneless chicken. If I didn't know any better, I would have thought this was made by a rookie. I'm extremely disappointed by this and I'm probably never going to order from here ever again. Another thing I forgot to mention was this place used to offer free delivery with a minimum order of $10.99 or something but now it's $3.49, which isn't much, but you would think this meant the quality of food would improve too but alas! I think the old chef has been replaced with a complete newbie. Either ways, really dissatisfied in having to eat an oily rice with no salt and be sold as a chicken biryani!"

Unfortunately there was a loss in the family, and they decided to move back home. I wish them happiness and thank them for the many years of delicious food and good service. I was really hopeful that the new owners would be at least half as good, because then they still would have been awesome. And I know the food can't taste exactly the same, but not only was it not as good as far as flavor, the quality took a dive. The orders were wrong, and missing items. I gave them some time to find their footing but it doesn't look like they care to. I no longer recommend this restaurant at all."

The other recent reviewers are right, this is no longer the same business that served great tasting food with decent portions and friendly service.I ordered my usual Chicken Tikka Masala and Vegetable Samosas. I have NEVER seen a tikka masala separate before in my life until tonight. There was so much oil that I nearly threw up just looking at it. The few pieces of chicken in it were lost among the curdled mess, tasted none of the tikka marinade, and the little I tasted was bland. The rice was bland and dry. The samosas were large sized but tasted awful. I don't know if they gave me expired food or it was supposed to be that sour. The mint chutney was a blend of sugar water and mint.I must have thrown 95% of the food into the trash. Waste of money and time."

My family has tried buying the frozen soup dumplings to steam at home from here, but it's really not the same, so I don't recommend getting them to go at all! Sadly, there's usually a wait time whenever I go, but they make the queuing process fairly easy with a sign up sheet taped by their entrance. However, if you have a party of 7 or more, you can call ahead to reserve their big table. The cherry on top is the free tong sui they serve you at the end of the meal.

We waited about 10-15 minutes before they brought out the food, so around 6:45p.  The dinner was a mini buffet with 'salad' (just leaves, nothing in it), pasta, chicken, and bread. The pasta was 'meh', the chicken was dry. Then as we're eating, there's all this commotion and apparently the band wanted us out because they wanted to get people seated in our seats and they wouldn't perform until we left! So, instead of the place telling them, ""Sorry, it's our place and they paid to be here..."" they had their cake and ate it too; kicked us out before we could even finish, but had no problem keeping the full money.What a horse crap way to operate, especially since they clearly are desperate for people (having to lure tour groups there). Pro tip for their management; if they want keep taking one-off tour groups' money then sit them somewhere else or get them earlier so you can have to seats back... instead of kicking out paying customers literally with forks in their hands."

She also added food to our bill that was not ours. As we told her she just walked away, mid convo! How strangeThey add an automatic tip as well which she definitely Didnt deserve. I'd recommend she quits or gets fired, she is not fit for this role. To be fair they are severely understaffed. Maybe 3 servers for 300 people on a Saturday night? The The venue is nice actually. Good music experience too, but would be so much to just have staff that give you 20-39 seconds to order a drink? I eventually went up to the bar, they were better there, that was the place to get drinks."

However the bathrooms are out of the way all the way in the basement and the tables upstairs are to close together . We got tickets to see a live band and we got VIP tickets , but the only thing about that was because it had tables , the view of the stage is horrible and if the dance floor is crowded you don't really get to see much ."

It appears they don't really care, which is unfortunate, as evidenced by lack of replies via email or other reviews we've seen posted online.We ordered 3 burgers and a bottle of wine. The lamb burger (and their fries are awesome, btw) were great. The two regular burgers were a disappointment. One was ordered medium without a bun due to a gluten allergy (your server was great to mention that the fries are cooked in the same oil where gluten is present, kudos for that), but there was no real alternative to not having a bun (no lettuce wrap, no offer to put it on a salad, a different starch, etc.) Not a big deal but a little surprising. The second burger was ordered medium-rare with no mods. Both burgers arrived overcooked--well done to be exact. We decided to send the supposed medium-rare one back, but it seemed like it was a little bit of a production; the staff seemed shocked and annoyed, glad we didn't send both back! Surprisingly, there was no apology; again, not a big deal. The server took the burger with the toppings back to the kitchen and left the plate with fries so the diner could eat while the burger was remade. This was appreciated, but when they brought the new burger out, there were no burger toppings included, it was literally the burger and bun on a small plate. We didn't bother asking for new toppings since everyone was already bothered by us. Honestly, the burger should've come replated with fresh fries and a new toppings, that's typical of service. The most unexpected part, imo, there was no effort by staff or management to check if the burger was ok after it was remade. To be fair it was, but shouldn't someone check? It seemed like another diner, not with us, also sent his burger back, but we were unaware of the specifics.We were not looking for comped food or a fine dining experience, just normal service. It's not often we send food back, we know what it's like behind the scenes, we've spent time in the industry. My guess being Memorial Day, the normal staff wasn't there, but I assume there was a manager present? Disappointing, sorry to say!"

When it came time to order i decided to get the namesake burger with a side of their house fries. A solid burger with no complaints! The service here was amazing and the vibes as the night continued here was also great. I'd recommend coming here for dinner with a small group for a guaranteed great evening.

It was light and not heavy.After meeting friend over coffee, went back to order lunch for the kids.They have Value Duets for $7.99 (these are fixed item 1/2 sandwich plus soup) went for the Napa Almond Chicken Salad Sandwich with Wild Rice Soup. Soup was a tad salty. Sandwiches were awesome.Never had their bread bowls (sourdough bread) before. Saw so many photos from Yelpers so you got me ordering one with Chicken Noodle Soup. ($8.89).***Tip- If you Taking Out or Pick Up or Carry out. Make sure you have all your items before leaving the store. The ladies who prepared the food order did not put it the Chicken Noodle Soup. That sourdough bread bowl would have been naked and lonely without the hearty soup.Tables were not clean. Had to switch tables. Did not see anyone cleaning. Bring wipes."

Can't say the grilled cheese lived up to its name because it was far from grilled. Barely cooked on the exterior and was still smushy like any ol' white bread. American cheese smacked between some white bread is not the worth 7-9ish bucks (but I guess that's Panera for you). The tomato soup is plenty and I plan on making my own grilled cheese and eating it together (I'm sure I can get a couple more sandwiches out of it).

I wasn't all that hungry because I had to eat before hand or I would have fainted by the time it was 7 pm. My guy had a heavy lunch so we kept it light and simple. I got some uni nigiri and he got some salmon nigiri. Although we cannot eat, we always can drink. We shared a sake and it was pretty good. It was called ""A drop to the soul?"" I don't know if it touched or even tickled my soul, but it was clean sake. For $20, not bad at all. I had time to study the menu because my guy was running late. I looked at other people's reviews and pics to get a general idea of what I wanted. I wasn't all that impressed with the items on the menu and they were missing tamago and ikura in the a la carte section... The uni wasn't the freshest looking uni when it came out. Overall, an okay place. The staff is super nice and the interior is very Japanese. I am not sure if it was intended for me, but when I came back from the bathroom, there was a space heater by me.

I ordered today for delivery to my office and was underwhelmed even though I didn't have high expectations to begin with.I got the three roll combo for $14 which came with either soup or salad; I opted for the miso soup which was fine but nothing notable. For my rolls, I ordered a spicy tuna, a salmon avocado, and an Alaska roll. The ratio of fish to rice was admittedly very generous so credit where due there. However the quality of the fish was questionable and I don't think I would ever order from there if it weren't for the lunch special.It was fine and I wouldn't warn against it; however I won't order from there again unless I had a distinct reason to."

Anyways, food overall is cheap, chicken burrito is usually very popular. However I had cravings for shrimp dishes. Therefore I ordered the shrimp taco, shrimp fajita and shrimp nachos. I discovered that the shrimp was breaded and fried, there out of the three orders, shrimp nachos was my least favorite. I did enjoy both the shrimp tacos and shrimp fajitas. I'd definitely return to this place for the shrimp tacos. It's $15 minimum to use credit card and I believe there is also a small fee for using it so bring cash."

We moved and are now closer to the better Taco king on bell blvd which is now closed, RIP. Thankfully this taco king is on grubhub and we can order from here again which has been disappointing each time so far - the food itself is still good but the price is more and they actually give smaller quantity. The S2 came with like 5 thin strips of chicken, only was able to use one tortilla and my side of rice and beans was all rice and a small layer of beans on top. Quesadillas are significantly smaller too, but I do like that they use the little boxes for them. We used to always be able to add cheese to the S2 for an extra dollar when calling them directly, but since this taco king uses grubhub drivers we understand that they can't accommodate this request (which she told us very adamantly) even tho I'm pretty sure there's a way for them to adjust the grubhub amount bc of modifications anyways BUT w/e. They told us there's an option to add a side of cheese, but rly....it's $4.00, why would we pay $4 when all we want is a bit of cheese sprinkled over the combo like it's rly not a lot of cheese. I saw an option to add a side of tortillas amounted to $1.50 and wrote in the comments that I don't want tortillas just want some cheese and we called them to make sure they got the message, the lady started giving us SO MUCH attitude about how she told us so many times before and they can't do it and getting nasty.

Reminds me of the loyal, losery friends who you didn't really want to be seen with but they always came back to you. Actually, it's more like the player who can do everything well. They are like the 5-tool player of Chinese take-out. They have crappy Chinese, good chinese, Japanese sushi and bento boxes, Thai food, and more. The menu goes on and on in so many ways. Their sushi is has great rice and the temperature is just right. If this in a restaurant, it would be much higher rated and appreciation. Like if Happy Kitchen has this food, it would be awesome."

I have been eating here for years and years. The delivery man never listens to instructions and he is rude over the phone. Sure there might be a bit a language barrier but I've encountered Chinese speaking language barrier delivery people many times so I know that isn't the excuse for his behavior. He will keep hanging up the phone and if you keep calling he will leave you ignored while still on the line. He doesn't listen. Food is good, delivery man not so much."

I always like the outside seating at this place, there's on particular spot just under the AC unit which I wouldn't sit at since you can hear the AC sound throughout while dining. Overall a nice spot!"

We now live in Astoria but it is still one of our to-go-to stops when we are in the neighborhood. Nice outside set up and decent AC inside on hotter days. Great wine selection and while the food menu is on the smaller side, what they offer is great (fantastic cheese selections). The last 2 times we have been there Jo (I believe is her name?--from our receipt yesterday...short light hair, lots of tattoos) and both times super kind and attentive service. It's off the beaten path on a picturesque block of Havemeyer and well worth the short trek a few blocks off busy Bedford."

Really a great spot for drinks and snacks with friends. Not too much foot traffic nearby so the bar is less rowdy than similar bars of this size. We had a nice time here.

2304,sMwo18huDJ_KmKoLwcrBUQ,11/21/2016,4 star rating,"Thank you Campo Bello for satisfying my craving for Spanish food! I ordered the beef stew and a side of plantains...then added a side of yellow rice at the end. The beef was very tender and flavorful. The plantains were crispy on the outside and it just melts in your mouth. Oh my goodness, the food exceeded my expectations and it was worth the $9.45. I wish I had room for the tres leche cake, that looked really good too ( AND IT WAS ONLY $3/slice). There are three parts to the restaurant: catering, take out and sit down. The service was quick and the waitresses were all pretty nice. It was spacious, but it was sorta weird how the restaurant was divided... On the side note, you can't buy the take out food and sit down at the tables. You have to eat it outside of the restaurant."
2305,sMwo18huDJ_KmKoLwcrBUQ,1/10/2022,2 star rating,"I used to be a regular customer. When the owner was by the takeout area, the service was great and the food then was also very good. Haven't seen him in the last 2 years and I've gone to a nearby Spanish food place for my food now where there's better service and the food is tasty and excellent. Went there this Sunday to buy pasteles and maybe something more because the other restaurant was packed and they had run out of pasteles.  So I enter, and there's only one young lady in front of me and we both wait to be attended to at the takeout area. I see only a few people seated at one table waiting for their food. 3 women are behind the counter  and 2 of them seemed to be making plates of food for the people at the table. Very slowly, having conversations between them and the third one looked to be doing a phone order. She finally came over to the lady in front of me after about 6 minutes and took her requests for take out.  After finishing with that she just walked around trying to look busy. Filled up 2 plates with plantains that had just come out from the kitchen. and placed them aside meanwhile conversing with the other 2  who were still going in slow motion for the table people.  After me waiting patiently for 10 minutes after the lady in front had been served, she finally looks in my direction and decides to come over to take my order.  I just took 2 of the 3 pasteles that were left. All the while she's very disinterested and too casual behind the counter. Terrible service in my opinion. I would have ordered other foods, but I wanted to get out of there ASAP.  They used to be a busy place.  I can see why they aren't busy anymore and their dining room almost empty while at the other restaurant I go to , it's always busy and crowded. I get service much faster even with people in front of me and the food is better.  The owner of Campo Bello should come pay a surprise visit and see how lax his employees have become and how they're costing him a lot of lost income."

2307,sMwo18huDJ_KmKoLwcrBUQ,4/7/2019,5 star rating,The food is is great! They have a section for take-out and for eating in. They also have a section for catering  parties.  If you're eating in do not go starving because the wait is long. We waited yesterday for our food at least 45 minutes. As courtesy they should (like other restaurants do) serve some warm bread with butter to munch on as you wait. The portions are big!! I guess from all the waiting they figure you're hungry. The staff is very friendly and very attentive.  Spanish music is playing all the time but not loud that you cannot speak.  I am Spanish so I know about Spanish food and you won't be disappointed.  The only set back is that the restaurant is in a not too great neighborhood.  I've never encountered any problems.  Just be alert.  There is parking in the back of restaurant.
2308,sMwo18huDJ_KmKoLwcrBUQ,7/31/2018,2 star rating,Food is good here but service is horrible.  Ordered for delivery twice.  First time food took a long time but it was good so figured we would try it again.  This time delivery said 2 hours but we ordered early so figured we would wait since the food was decent.  Waited 2 hours only to find out from grub hub they canceled our order.  And only found out because we called the restaurant to find out where our food was.  They hung up on us.  And the. We got a call from grub hub letting us know that our order was canceled.  Sounds to me like they don't really want to do delivery.  If that's the case they need to stop offering or advertising for delivery.  Especially on grub hub!  Will never order from this place again.

The also serve breakfast which is very delicious. The food is decent ""for Staten Island"" it's definitely not the best Spanish food I've had but it's great for the island which is limited to authentic Spanish flavor food so I say this no disrespect to Staten Island.Today's sit down experience was simple, a few dollars over priced from what I'm use to in other Spanish spots. No big deal!!! today my chicken gusido had so much slimy skin I couldn't enjoy it to my full advantage. Soup was a bit cold, Weird I no bc it is in a hot buffet setting. Not sure where that went wrong.Beautiful buffet everything looks so amazing an fresh, when you come an if you come in starving you want to order everything. The desert is good I enjoyed flan an the Dominican cake in the past.Not the worst an not the greatest it's decent food. Servers are very nice as well as the cashier. It's a huge place you can even have an event here in the right side room when walking in. Very clean all around an all the severs have nets on there heads an gloves (A+) I'm a huge fan of elephants an there's elephant figures all over I love it. It used to be a Chinese buffet spot a few years back. One day asked about the elephants an they had said it came when they took over the business an converted to Spanish food. Cute place I'll  be back for a quickie here an there I'm a Regular for the coffee an breakfast delivery."

It's was 6 o'clock in the evening and they said they ran out of pernil. And they bought out a chicken soup without chicken.  They didn't say anything until questioned and then decided to tell the customer that  they were out of chicken as well.  Yet they served the soup that way.  The taste of the food that they did have wasn't bad, which is why they got the two stars.  But we asked for three dishes before we were actually able to get a dish."
2313,ZybTcEwBUeQqiiyyBpoiPQ,3/25/2023,5 star rating,Mambo No. 6If you're in Flushing and hungry for authentic Chinese food but not looking for a sit down.  Wonton maybe? Go visit White Bear on Roosevelt by Main St Flushing. Shown in multiple YouTube influencers and TV shows.   They rarely say a word. You will be ordering from a magical glory-hole-like window.  I always come here.  Few pro tips:1. Bring cash2. Look at menu prior to stepping up to glory hole. 3. Order with confidence!You'll enjoy this food. Prices has gone up a lot but still worth it. Remember you will not have seating.  You can always pull up to a hydrant to eat.  I always order No. 6 (spicy wonton).  It's what they are well known for.  Come on down!
2314,ZybTcEwBUeQqiiyyBpoiPQ,4/1/2023,4 star rating,"According to every food vlogger on TikTok, White Bear is a MUST in your Flushing food crawl.However, I personally just thought it was okay. The food came out incredibly quickly, piping hot. My friend and I got the popular #6, wontons with spicy sauce/chili oil. $10.It was decent, but I felt that it wasn't anything crazy special. A little bland, if anything. The portion size is OK for the price.Definitely wouldn't hurt to add this location to your food crawl. It's near all the other popular spots."

2317,ZybTcEwBUeQqiiyyBpoiPQ,2/13/2023,3 star rating,"I wanted to like this place. I really did. I love spicy wontons in general and when I walked up to this booth (literal window that you walk up to on the street), I see two women hand rolling fresh wontons. Looked delicious. I ordered their popular spicy chili wontons for $10. I think it came with 12 of them. When we first opened up the container, we were drooling because they looked so good. Then we had our first bite. Something was missing. The flavor of the meat and wonton skin was actually good and I thought the skin/meat ratio was good (unlike some other reviews). The meat was moist and everything tasted fresh. But like I said, we thought it was missing something. The chili oil on top was a bit deceiving. It was not spicy at all. It needed some more spicy and also some vinegar to make it more sour and liquidy. Maybe a splash of dark soy sauce too. I don't want to bash this place because I want them to continue to do well. The wontons were quite good. I just wish the sauce was improved. A simple remedy would be to put a bottle of vinegar, some chili oil, and bottle of soy sauce by the window so customers can add it to their wontons as they want."

We got the Chili Oil Dumplings, which was No. 6 on the menu. I thought they were really tasty, but I do wish it was spicier. The place is cash only and their storefront was only doing ToGo when I was there. So this place is a quick stop for some tasty bites!"

Didn't have a strong impression of them then, and still don't have a strong impression of them now.The store was takeout only now and only take cash. The #6 Wonton with Hot Sauce ($10) went viral, but they also sell a ton of other options like noodles and rice cakes. The prices have also increased tremendously.I think the #6 had around 11 or 12 wontons. The name says ""Hot Sauce"" but just like last time, these are not spicy! It has a chili oil on it, with a very prominent black bean seasoning. The smushed black beans were all I could taste, with a ton of oil doused onto each wonton bite. The wonton skin was also very doughy. I didn't find these enticing to eat more either. One was enough for me. At around $1 for each wonton, these are jewels in a bowl! I would pass and wish these were actually spicy like their presentation."

2321,ZybTcEwBUeQqiiyyBpoiPQ,3/4/2023,5 star rating,"Spicy wontons here are very solid! It's $10 for 12, which is a little more expensive than other places in Flushing. It's just a window where you order, and the food came out almost instantly. The wontons are generously sized, and the skin is really nice and thin. I liked the flavor of the pork filling, as it was well seasoned and still pretty juicy. The sauce had good flavor, and was only slightly spicy. I wish there was a bit more of it though. Overall a little overhyped, but still solid."

A hole in the wall spot owned by an older couple, is well known for delicious chili oil wontons. I used to love coming here for their chili oil wontons.

The space is somewhat small for the foot traffic they get, decorated with a ton of floral and other IG worthy decor. We had a reservation and was informed upon arrival that we'd only have 90 minutes to dine, although we definitely stayed longer than that.My gf ordered the Massaman Curry w Crispy Half Duck ($30), which overall was good. The duck meat was on the dry side, but it was fine when you drench it in the curry. I got the Salmon Stone Pot ($25), which was interestingly served in a super hot stone pot, which remained hot for a good 15+ minutes. Consisted of a seared salmon, Tom Yum Fried Rice, and an egg. Was not very sure of the proper way to eat this, but I ended up breaking the salmon into pieces and mixed it with the fried rice and egg. Slight spicy kick to it and overall was delicious."
2325,F8WAp6PLIhM_0mNbVTsSzg,2/13/2023,4 star rating,"After reading many of the rave reviews, I decided to try the Massaman curry (takeout). This review is purely about the food. Massaman curry - Delicious sauce with authentic flavors (I've had this dish in Thailand many times) but fell short of expectations. The chicken was sparse and the ingredients appeared hastily mixed together. There was a small piece of plastic included with the sauce. Last time I checked, that wasn't part of the recipe...Coconut sticky rice - Very good. Definitely better than the store bought brand (Costco sells). Not much more I can say. Wish there were because I really wanted to experience the amazing food everyone else had."

My friends had the green curry with a mango mojito. They were  both delicious. Just the right amount of spice and kick.Both came with a salad and either dumplings or spring roll. The only downside is it is extremely tight. Tables are right on top of reach other so conversations did not feel private at all.Just be aware that their last call for lunch is at 3:30.

Some of the best and flavorful pad Thai I've had. On top of the delicious food, service was great and the restaurant itself is beautiful.

It has a lovely design and each dish is presented great, but the flavors did not match the look.Quality: Bangkok Degree was a bit more style than substance. Each dish was presented beautifully and the space is lovely, but I just did not love any of the food items. The Homemade Spring Rolls were my favorite bite, but the sauce dumped on top and bottom did not make sense. The Chicken Pad Thai was fine, but it lacked that sweetness needed to pull the flavors together. I did not like the Crispy Duck Rice. I thought it was going to be presented together, instead of do-it-yourself. The duck was also overcooked and tough. The Mango Sticky Rice had good flavor, but the decision to leave it in the skin just made it tough to eat.Quantity: Decent sized portions.Value: $8 for Homemade Spring Rolls. $16 for Chicken Pad Thai. $30 for Crispy Duck Rice. $10 for Mango Sticky Rice.Ambiance: Bangkok Degree is a Thai restaurant located in Park Slope. It has a very colorful and chic design. Lots of greenery, decorations, and neon lights. There is a large bar towards the back of the space, which almost gives the impression they are a cocktail bar first. The music selection was not my favorite, a weird techno mix. They also need to do something about the front door, which does not automatically close, and no one follows the sign. Every time someone comes in or out a cold gust of air fills the space.Crowd: A couple of other guests, lots of take-out orders.Service: Friendly waitress, and food was out quickly.Parking: Plenty of street parking nearby."

And as you can see from my 5 star review, the rumors are quite true.The crispy duck with massaman curry was a 10/10. The duck was deliciously tender and juicy with a nice crunchy, crispy skin on the outside layer. The curry was also so good since it was a mix of potato, onion, peanut, and coconut milk. You can taste a bit of the coconut come through in the aftertaste. Unfortunately the lychee iced tea was terrible - it had the weirdest taste ever. Just avoid this and you're golden."

The drinks are very imaginative and well balanced. We also split appetizers: the burrata is rich and creamy, a perfect pair with the whisky flight. The shishito peppers are presented with a smoky dome (tip: take a video when the waiter unveils it). The highlight was the bone marrow: super rich, meat marrow with decadent garlic toast.

We had probably one of the best spots in the house, since we could hear the music and see performances while being isolated from the noise of the bar - honestly, most of the floor was loud, and most of the balcony area is out of view from the stage. For one of those cute tables directly in front of the stage, I think you'd need a reservation.The food was all delicious, though don't expect large portions. Wait staff were nice and didn't rush us when we finished eating, allowing us to enjoy the music a bit more."

It's sexy and the live music was fantastic.If you've been wanting a fun *fancier* but not ""break the bank"" date night; I would absolutely point you in this direction.They have an unmatched selection of whiskey cocktails. It's fun to watch the servers bring down some of the more unique bottles from the ceiling. The food was a mixed bag. Because we came for restaurant week we got an appetizer, entree and dessert. Apps were great, mains were ok, dessert was delicious. I think there are some hidden gems on the menu I would like to try if I came back.My date got steak and I had stuffed pasta. It was VERY mushroomy and had a unique aftertaste. I'd opt for something else in the future.The service was ok, we had to flag down our server once or twice for a drink refill.Overall still a good experience and I'd come back.4/5"

No complaints here.   The part that makes this place even more magical though? The staff and management. They take the time to really make your experience what you need it to be. We had a Sommelier to our table giving us some of the best single malt recommendations. We know our scotch but this was a treat to have this gentleman guide us through some uncharted waters. Since it was our first time we did the flight of single malts but when I return and believe me, I WILL RETURN! I intend on doing some rare scotch tastings by the dram.   They also offer one of the coolest things I've seen. Buy a bottle from them and they will store it in their reserve for you, so when you come next time you can just drink your own bottle! Brilliant. I will be doing this for sure too! If you haven't been here, it is a NYC MUST!!!! Do not miss and make sure you make reservations or you won't get a table. I also recommend their merchandise at the front too. They make an amazing barrel aged coffee that is delightful! And much more cost effective than the one they sell at the Starbucks reserve store in Chelsea. Thank you guys for a transportive experience, the ambiance was killer! Till next time!"

2383,3oB2_2vpeIyxJt1GvlcZBA,3/5/2023,5 star rating,Crab roe soup dumplings were wonderful. Great flavor but also the texture of the dumpling skin was perfect - thin enough for a great chew while thick enough not to be too fragile to get the dumpling to your mouth to enjoy the broth inside. They also have black vinegar with fresh CRISP slivers of ginger to liven the dumpling after the soup is all gone. I came alone for a quick snack and now will return with a larger group to experience more of the menu. This bodes well for the next visit!

I walked over with a coworker around 1230 and there was no wait for the tables.The restaurant is nice inside and clean. The staff were very friendly and set us right away. We ordered the regular grandma's pork soup dumplings and also the pan fried soup dumplings. Both were really great with a lot of flavor, but the original soup dumplings were better because there was less breading.I also ordered the pork shredded and garlic sauce, and it was so delicious. Definitely worth trying. They do not hold out on the garlic. they have a good lunch special here that includes an entrée, a spring roll and a soup for $15. Overall for the lunch special, an entrée and two kinds of dumplings our receipts ended up being around $50 so pretty good price for two people."

Seemed like an interesting spot, offering a drink each, three dim sum plates, and an entree to share. I think the deal was for somewhere around $50 but there was also a deal on Groupon which made it less, so... why not, right?It was a very nice and more ""takeout"" looking place, fairly empty, though I saw a lot of to go orders and delivery.We ordered our food and drinks, which didn't take too long to do. The server didn't allow for dim sum substitutions, which I get it - but my sub would have cost less than the dim sum.The dim sum was fine, nothing to really write home about. I liked my dumplings, but didn't care for their spring rolls or shumai.The entree is listed as ""family style"" but that was pretty misleading. The rice portion was so clearly for one person and we ordered the general Tao's chicken - which - sure, if you were nibbling at it could have been for two, but not comfortably. We weren't really overly pleased with the food or experience overall. I would have honestly preferred takeout. The food was just okay. I was mostly disappointed with the portions above all else since we did end up having to order more. Not a really great Groupon. Takeout would have been less than half the price, more food, and I wouldn't have expected an actual nice evening out."

Cute little spot for a quick Asian bite though :)"
2389,3oB2_2vpeIyxJt1GvlcZBA,1/3/2023,4 star rating,"In hindsight, I wish I would've just gotten 10 orders of the spicy wontons in chili oil. They stole the show and had so much flavor! We also ordered General Tso's which was a little better than your neighborhood spot. Tasted a little fresher, and served with really delicious broccoli and white rice. The pork bun was good and had a nice, fluffy texture, but the filling was very minimal. The soup dumplings were another favorite. The filling was tasty but nothing overly spectacular. The dan dan noodles were not the flavor I was hoping for. I had previously had these at a Sichuan restaurant and these fell a little short of my hopes. Moral of the story: Order LOTS of wontons in chili oil with maybe 1 or two other things."

It is upscale fancy Chinese restaurant with lots of dim sum offering and some typical Chinese food at uptown prices.Lunch specials (egg drop soup + 1pc vegetable spring roll with bowl of rice) $15 with 2 rice plates at $17/18. We ordered:2 lunch specials- Kung pao chicken + hot pot chicken and 1 roast duck noodle soup. We ordered pork soup dumplings + crunchy wontons for appetizers. The appetizers came last. The 2 chicken dishes were very similar but kung pao is more saucy (chili oil). Both chicken dishes had similar seasoning/spice that gave us a werid after-taste and the chili oil seem to give us a werid numbing/tingling feeling in our lips. Both spring rolls were COLD (not even room temperature). Rice seems old/dried out. The noodles in the soup was different from picture on menu and looked like spaghetti noodles not Chinese noodles. The crunchy wonton are very crunchy but still pink/reddish (see photo). Soup dumpling barely had soup inside- was dried out. Next time we'll stick to chinatown for the soup dumplings.Bathrooms are nice and clean. Place is spacious and lovely. Great for groups and great service. There looks like there is a outside back patio.

I wanted to celebrate my wife for being published in a fashion magazine for her work on a fashion editorial as a MUA. She looooves dumplings, and I found a great bargain on Pulsd. (Let me tell you, download the Pulsd app! STOP paying full price when you can literally enjoy NYC at half the cost!)The place was very nicely put together, clean, and the service was spectacular (thanks Kenny!). The food was truly delicious, served hot and fresh, and the beer was icy cold on a rather hot early eve!Wether you're looking for a great place to eat lunch or dinner, this is a great spot to head for! So many yummy choices!And be sure to let Kenny know we recommended Baodega! Cheers!"

The Rose Milk Tea had bits of actual rose in it, was super creamy, and at 50%, it was just sweet enough. They use creamer as the ""milk"" in this drink so I highly recommend switching to a non-dairy alternative if that's a concern for you. Unfortunately, that makes the drink even pricier for an already pricy drink. But the quality and flavors are definitely there so you won't regret it."

The bowls are the perfect portion, their fish is always fresh (I get salmon/tuna), they're generous with the toppings, and my bowl stays intact because it's filled to the top. The only caveat is that each poke bowl runs you $18.95 online without the extra costs. It's expensive, but so tasty, so I'll keep coming back.Their drinks are good and standard too. Can't wrong with a passion fruit green tea."
2398,t01jp2WFJvAWh_TGk7Aguw,7/26/2021,4 star rating,"For those that like rose milk tea, Infinitea offers a great version of the drink. The rose milk tea is light, smooth, refreshing, and slightly (but not over the top creamy). There's a nice rose floral flavor to it that's not overwhelming. It's the one drink I enjoy here. I've tried the classic milk tea and mango green tea before, neither were memorable. I believe the rose milk tea is the standout drink. I recommend to get it at about 50% sweet. I've tried 100% and 80% sweet before and both were too sweet for me. I also prefer not to get the boba. You can walk inside like a normal tea shop now and there's some countertop seating along the edges of the wall. The A/C in the shop is comfortable for a hot day."

When they were on 214th and Broadway, in the Inwood section!!My favorite was always the Chocolate cake! In fact both of my brothers had their wedding cakes from here back in the day. Today I was looking for a cheese cake. So we ventured out to Washington Hts! I bought a cheese cake with strawberries on it! So glad we did. I picked up some of my favorite chocolate cake, a little carrot cake and a chocolate cheese cake. All small sizes. My husband had the cappuccino which was excellent!!

Since the old front workers been gone the people at the counter have a bad attitude to the customers not all, but  especially the short guy that sometimes he is cooking and other times working the from counter.  To hear him tell a customer for asking questions about the cakes on display and calling them basically stupid and dont know how to read is pretty disgusting.   This really show me that his behavior and bad attitude he is the one with an IQ the size of his shoe!  If you don't know how to communicate with the customers in front and cant treat the customers with respect go back to the back of the kitchen and stay back there cooking!Happy Thanksgiving!!"

A recent visit to Washington Heights was the perfect opportunity to check out the hype myself.The custom, orange-and-green neon signs and backlight bakery display span two walls and pop out against the muted tiles and dimly-lit room. The walls are otherwise decked with memorabilia representing Carrot Top's many accolades. A few varnished wooden tables and green-cushioned chairs are dispersed around the space.I popped into this location midday, and there were a few other folks browsing the options. One staff member was brusque, while another was clueless, but I still managed to successfully secure a slice of carrot cake and a brownie.The carrot cake was intensely carrot-y and perfectly sweet. The cake itself was dense yet moist, slightly grainy sporting large chunks of walnuts, complemented well by heavy cream cheese icing. Brownie, in contrast, was a letdown. It was nearly as dense as fudge, yet strangely didn't taste overwhelmingly sweet or chocolatey. Further, it was overwhelmingly walnut-y, with a layer on top and large chunks many mixed in.My items set me back right around $10, expensive on paper, but fair considering that each individual item could easily be divided between two folks. While I admittedly don't love carrot cake and wouldn't usually order it, I would return to Carrot Top for their spot-on rendition."

I actually had to make two attempts to come here in one day, the first I tried biking and got caught it the heaviest downpour of rain I've been in for years, so I turned around defeated, got a change of clothes, and took the subway instead.It's absolutely a decent slice of carrot cake, moist, carroty, and very sweet icing. Lloyds Carrot Cake it the other bakery that claims to specialize in carrot cakes, and Carrot Top is the clear winner between the two.I'll be coming back, but it's a stretch to call this the best carrot cake in NYC - I've definitely had better so set your expectations accordingly!"

When we cut into the cake, it crumbled as if it was previously frozen... My husband thought I was imagining it and said ""why would a bakery do that?"" The cake itself was good, and we were happy with it. We decided to give their strawberry cheesecake another try and picked one up for a birthday celebration to help redeem the bakery. BIG MISTAKE! I can confirm that they do freeze their cheesecake, as when we cut into the cake after several hours of bringing it home, the strawberry as well as the center of the cake was still frozen. Worst part? I couldn't get a slice of the cheesecake on to a plate without it crumbling into numerous pieces. When I serve it, it looked like slop. Even worse than that, more than half of the cake tasted like really bad freezer burn. Gross!!  We had to throw it out as it was inedible. For over $40 for a medium cheesecake, you'd think they would sell a freshly baked cake. But nope, they probably mass produce it, freeze it, and sell old cake to unsuspecting customers. Unacceptable!I hate writing negative review, but it had to be done. Won't be picking up any more cake from this establishment, and I can't recommend this place either."

The employees would place a large breakfast order every morning. The food would come fresh and delicious. It is your typical bakery which serves breakfast options, cakes, muffins, etc. As the name states, it is most popular for its carrot cake which I have tried several times.This week I was in the mood for some sweets so I decided to order a chocolate cake and muffins. I ordered a carrot muffin and a chocolate muffin. Both muffins were packed with flavor and healthy portions of carrot/chocolate. The chocolate cake was large for the price. However, the cake was very dry and didn't have much flavor. There was a lot of icing on the cake but it just a pure sugar that I didn't care for. Overall, the cake was just way too sweet for me. If I come here again I would go for the muffins but probably will pass on the chocolate cake."

But I do think that if you enjoy a not-so-sweet carrot cake you may enjoy this. They also added a generous amount of walnuts in the cake.

If you work in this area you will frequent the same places most of the time. My breakfast is an important meal. If it sucks, it can potentially ruin the rest of my day. As with most food establishments in Times Square, prices at Starlight are a little overpriced. I come here because of the convenience and my food has consistently been prepared exactly how I ask for it and usually in a timely manner. I've only gotten breakfast here but they do offer quite a variety of items for lunch or snacks as well.The coffee is terrible. I'll stick to the free coffee at work. There are better places to go but sometimes a 2 block walk further can make me late so this has been my recent go to when I'm short on time."

I go here only for convenience. A run to Starlight means something quick and easy, but speaking for the food, very uninspiring and most sandwiches end up being dry. Ingredients do not seem so fresh. There are much better delis around this area, within same price range, but the service/food will be much better. Otherwise, I personally would avoid in any other case.I have been going here for a number of years, and I witnessed a steady decline of quality. The food is just not good, and the selection is noticeably limiting. I have tried a share of Starlight's sandwiches, and I found them to be terrible. The meat is always dry, the bread stale, the cheese mediocre. The quality of the cold cuts are not great and most come pre-sliced. Sandwiches in general are just not prepared with as much TLC as I have experienced at other small local delis like this. You will end up paying $8-10 for a below average sandwich. They have options for a variety of sandwiches and salads but not much beyond that. Soup is not an option here and nor is a self-serve salad bar. Their staff has been obnoxious to generally friendly. It is never too busy in here that I had to wait in a long line, so there goes a plus."

I think most of us have fond memories of Carvel ice cream.  On my last visit I was curious about their new product, butter cream. The nice young lady (I'm sorry I didn't catch her name, as she did a great job) offered me a free sample of the soft serve, and I knew then that I had found the flavor of my small milkshake.Butter cream is a delightful slice of fall fun! (There is a sentence I never thought I'd write, but I stand by it!!) The soft serve at this location is always perfect, no ice crystals, and great texture! Another favorite, which this location always seems to have on tap is the pistachio flavored soft serve.  I recommend you pair this flavor with ia fudge brownie Sundae Dasher, you can thank me later. Don't forget a pack of the iconic Flying Saucers which they always have in stock and freshly made with associated flavors and add ons to choice from. Head on over for a treat, even at peak times, the line moves fast and they have a cupple of outdoor tables for when the weather is nice.

I ended up trying the Churro ice cream flavor that was advertised. I got it in the waffle sundae cup with churro topping pieces (not the crunch). The crunch pieces are similar to cinnamon toast crunch. The ice cream was delicious. It was more than I bargained for so I had to take the rest home with me.

The gentleman on the phone said they had several other options which were in stock, so I dropped in a got something else which my son and the guests enjoyed. Although they sell Carvel cakes at local grocery stores such as the nearby Stop & Shop, I suggest coming in to this Carvel store so that you have a much higher chance of getting a fresher cake, and you will certainly have more options as far as flavors and sizes. They can also more easily personalize something for you. There is an adjacent parking lot so you easily can pop right in and out. It was nice to see that they also had a large container of hand sanitizer for their customers to use. The two ladies who helped me were very friendly and efficient. No doubt I'll come back here.PS: I didn't look up the Yelp reviews on this location before I decided to come in so I was pretty surprised that there were so many bad reviews over the past year.

2473,9v4l7pz4J709z0mkqUpQbw,2/12/2023,5 star rating,I never leave reviews but really like this place. I'm slowly making my way through the entire menu. So far my favorites are Khao Soi and Red Curry both with fried tofu and one spice. Also the Eggplant Basil with one spice. My dog and I love the sweet coconut rice and make sure to get it either as a side or as the mango dessert each time :) Everyone is very nice and accommodating. They make my Thai iced tea and Taro tea with boba less sweet for me which are delicious drinks that go well with the food. Lunch specials are a great way to try some of the dishes. Only minor challenge has been getting the spice level right for my taste so from now on I'm sticking to one spice (mild) because I figure that's better than it being too spicy. Can always add spice but can't take away. Thanks everyone at Savory Thai!

Food is delicious and reasonably priced, and workers are sooo gentle and kind. Definitely a down-to-earth place, which is unique for New York City. Roti is phenomenal (if you like roti on the oily side), and the Thai fried rice, pad woo sen, massaman and red curries, all wonderful. They practically gave half an entire duck for my sister's duck red curry! So generous! Needless to say, I'll be coming here very often"
2475,9v4l7pz4J709z0mkqUpQbw,2/11/2023,4 star rating,Loved visiting this place! It's easy to find. And the food was just WOW! The lunch prices are unbeatable. Extremely cheap and comes with sides for $10-12! I ordered the beef basil w/ crispy spring rolls and the portion size was great!Only downside is limited seating! Might be best to carry out unless you are alone!
2476,9v4l7pz4J709z0mkqUpQbw,3/29/2023,5 star rating,11/10 food and service. Best meal I had in the week I spent in NYC. very homey and the food is some of the best Thai I've ever had. Perfect portions. Great music too. Also very affordable despite its locale in Williamsburg. If I could give this restaurant 6 stars I would.
2477,9v4l7pz4J709z0mkqUpQbw,3/2/2022,5 star rating,"Delicious Thai food for a fair price in Williamsburg! Both the drunken noodles and fried rice were super flavorful. They don't skimp out on meat and the portions are solid for what you pay. I've had their drunken noodles twice now and the spice levels were very different, once super spicy and today was mild, but it's still good regardless. Staff are super friendly and gave a free Thai tea with check in, even for take out. The restaurant is tiny so take out was perfect! Seats about 4 inside."
2478,9v4l7pz4J709z0mkqUpQbw,8/21/2022,5 star rating,Cute restaurant. The food is great! Got the appetizers and drunken noodles. One of the best calamari and wings I've ever had.
2479,9v4l7pz4J709z0mkqUpQbw,8/7/2021,2 star rating,"I tried their drunken noodles lunch special on a weekday and it was very mediocre. The flavor was simple, but my biggest issue was that my noodles were stuck together while cooking so I had large chunks of unflavored noodles. I went around 1:45PM and there wasn't a lunch rush, so I'm not sure why this happened. If you check in, you also get a thai tea or iced coffee, which works for take out. It wasn't good at all, so you're not missing out. I think I saw the guy pull a cup of premade powdered thai tea from their fridge and add ice or water to it..."

The string beans and green peppers in the pad krapow were so fresh yet had the perfect crunch to them. Their pad sew ew noodles (I asked for no Chinese broccoli) were also so good and the portion was plentiful.  And lastly, don't sleep on their Thai iced tea - it's the perfect compliment.New neighborhood go to!"

No employees have  clean tables around here even though it should be a protocol especially now during a pandemic. Does the CEO of this franchise even give a rats ads? Knats and flys all over me and my food. This is unacceptable in 2021. Its should be illegal to serve food here. And on top of it all the security guard is sleeping on the job most of the time. Wowwwww McDonald's! I think you have enough money by now to pay someone to clean all these germ ridden tables. You can do a little better than that. This is the first and  last time I will be coming here I swear. RONALD FIX THIS PLACE GOD DAMNIT it's a SHITHOLE!!!

Sometimes it's a hit or a miss. I only go when I have no other lunch options! They're also more pricey than the normal...If I felt like fighting crack heads I would go back and get it fixed.

No employees have  clean tables around here even though it should be a protocol especially now during a pandemic. Does the CEO of this franchise even give a rats ads? Knats and flys all over me and my food. This is unacceptable in 2021. Its should be illegal to serve food here. And on top of it all the security guard is sleeping on the job most of the time. Wowwwww McDonald's! I think you have enough money by now to pay someone to clean all these germ ridden tables. You can do a little better than that. This is the first and  last time I will be coming here I swear. RONALD FIX THIS PLACE GOD DAMNIT it's a SHITHOLE!!!

Went inside, pretty small location with just a few seats along the wall. I ordered a medium iced Thai tea (50% sugar, regular ice). And it tasted PERFECT. It wasn't too sweet at all so the 50% sugar was the perfect choice. I also got the salmon avocado roll which was really good too!! Not that the roll was covered in sesame seeds and the taste was empowering - lucky for me I like the taste of sesame seeds but not everyone does so big note on that! Otherwise, awesome location in the Union square region. Service was also relatively quick too, took a few more minutes that I had expected but that's fine & wasn't a problem overall!"
2584,Hm69skfQVxxToBm_VeZuVg,10/29/2022,3 star rating,"TL;DR - Review is only for the bubble tea that we got. Thai Ice Tea and Lychee Green Tea. Both teas were pretty meh to below average. If you are in this area, I would recommend FIFTYLAN Union Square which is only a couple of blocks away for great tea. Overall Ratings - Factoring in taste and costThai Ice Tea - 5/10. Tasted nothing like Thai Ice Tea and tasted more like a generic bubble milk tea. Not too sweet and the bubble were chewy but no flavor. Mainly disappointment was expected a Thai Ice Tea taste only to get a regular bubble tea taste.Lychee Green Tea - 5.5/10. Tasted the Green Tea flavor which was strong, but no Lychee flavor. Sugar and ice levels were good. Got the Lychee Jelly that tasted like normal Lychee Jelly."
2585,Hm69skfQVxxToBm_VeZuVg,9/2/2022,3 star rating,"[NYC BOBA TOUR STOP #35]My other stops on the boba tour: yelp.com/collection/4dXT…Trutea is very unassuming- it's a bit like a hole in the wall, but there's some bar-like seating and one table available for eating and drinking since it's a poke/boba combo place. My friend and I sat at the one table for awhile, catching up and such, and the employees were very nice about it! We ordered (rating): Mango Green Tea with Boba (4/5), Dirty Brown Sugar Milk Tea with Boba (2.5/5)Okay, so what I loved about my dirty brown sugar milk tea was that the tea itself was very creamy. I always worry about watery milk teas, but this wasn't! I thought there was a solid tea flavor in there and that it was unique. It was a very pleasant surprise. The thing is, this felt like it was their regular milk tea with brown sugar along the side of the cup and because of that it was entirely too sweet. With the sugar level on this drink was not adjustable, this ended up feeling like straight up sugar being pumped into my veins. It had just the right hint of milk tea in it that kept me drinking it but man oh man will the dentist be happy to get money out of me with all the cavities he finds in a few months. That milk tea was really what saved the drink because I also found that the boba lacked chew and was slightly on the slippery side. For Manhattan boba, the prices are super decent ($5-6 range). I feel like usually I find myself paying $7+ for a cup now, so I'm glad places like Trutea still exist where they give it to us for a little bit cheaper. This is the type of boba place where I feel like I have to come back to form a full opinion on. I want to try a milk tea where I am able to adjust the sugar and maybe one of the fruit teas. My friend for the most part liked her mango green tea, but it definitely doesn't seem like it's made with fresh fruit. It is giving fruit syrup. That doesn't necessarily make it bad, though- it's just in this current market when so many boba places make fruit teas with fresh fruit you might be disappointed. BUT I can't be sure you'd be disappointed which means I'll be returning. TBC!"

2588,Hm69skfQVxxToBm_VeZuVg,9/5/2021,4 star rating,"Good option if you need something quick to eat in the area, but their specialty bubble tea is underwhelming and pricey. Food/Drinks: - Poke Bowl: Solid with a good range of toppings and fresh fish. They do have signature bowls if you don't want to go through the hassle of making your own. There are also vegetarian options (tofu and veggies). I chose the medium sized build your own bowl (2 proteins) with spicy salmon and tuna. Be aware that the ""spicy"" fish version means the fish is diced and seasoned, so not the pretty cubed fish pieces you think of in a poke bowl. The customization is pretty standard where you can choose your vegetables, sauce, and crunchy toppings. They have you place your order by using a marker to make your selections on a laminated version of the menu. They do allow you to pick white or brown rice or mixture of salad + rice as the base of the bowl. I recommend doing the combo of salad + white rice, so you get the best of both! In addition, I always like having onions and jalapeños in my poke bowls as they go well with the fish and add a lot of flavor. Avocado costs extra (booooo). I chose the wasabi yuzu sauce, which has a light flavor, but the wasabi does come through.- Dirty Bubble Tea: their take on the brown sugar bubble tea. I got the milk tea and not the fresh milk version (they offer both). The medium size is quite small compared to other bubble tea places, so for the price, this is expensive. The straw they give you is the normal size straw for bubble tea, so it is comically long for how short the container is. In terms of taste, I think it is inferior to other brown sugar bubble teas that I have had in the past so not worth it in my opinion. I'm not a big sweets person, but there wasn't enough brown sugar flavor. The bubbles were soft but with still enough bite for texture. They allow you to customize the amount of ice and sugar in it, but you can't do that for the brown sugar bubble tea option. The pricing on Yelp is not accurate because the medium brown sugar one was in the $6 range. Atmosphere/Location: This is located on a busy street in Union Square. It has the vibe of a fast casual chain, but I did like the adorable colorful display of tea mugs on the wall. It has a few tables inside the small storefront, so you can eat there if you want to, but there is no outdoor dining option (you can go to Union Square park nearby to eat while doing some people watching). Service: Friendly and efficient! I had some questions about the bubble tea and poke bowls, and they were able to easily answer them for me. Food/drink came out very quickly, and they packaged everything, including utensils, since I decided to do take-out. Overall: If you are looking for something fast in the area, then this is a good spot to get a poke bowl, but don't expect amazing bubble tea!"
2589,Hm69skfQVxxToBm_VeZuVg,7/14/2021,2 star rating,"I'm pretty disappointed with the drink I got - a ""medium size"" taro milk tea with white jelly pearls instead of regular because they ran out. Because it was fairly expensive (they charge tip despite being a counter-serve place, so it ended up almost $7), I really wanted to like my drink. The container is small, probably ~10-12oz if I had to eyeball it. For these prices, you can easily get bigger drinks at better places. Frankly, the drink I got here didn't taste any better than kung fu tea or any generic place. The taro flavor is very artificial. On my way to my subway station, I passed by at least 4 other boba shops that I've been to before, that are better and less pricey. I personally wouldn't make this purchase again."

2591,Hm69skfQVxxToBm_VeZuVg,3/6/2022,5 star rating,"HIDDEN GEM ALERT. Honestly, this place has the best combination of poke and bubble tea that I've seen in the city. While their portions are not as insane as Pokéworks or other spots, the quality is consistent and true and is easily one of the best cuts of sushi you'll get!! This is no exaggeration. They serve miso soup alongside their bowls, but this miso soup is honestly an afterthought. Go for the milk tea and Poke. Seriously - this one is a must try for Asian cuisine eaters."

2595,6wik3tA4cRw7NA9KvNHidw,5/15/2022,3 star rating,"Kung Fu Tea is one of the more popular bubble tea chains and there's a nice tiny location here. In terms of chains I prefer it heavily over Vivi (a place where even the 30% sweetness feels like eating a sugar cube) and slightly over Moge (due to their prices being absurd) but I think the tea flavor is better at Gong Cha. However, there are other choices as well. HaWa has better fruit drinks but not better tea and DebuTea has a couple wonderful (somewhat overpriced) specialties and also just has better tea. I also prefer Coco slightly but there isn't a location nearby so it's hard to compare. All comparisons aside, my preference here is the taro milk tea. It's not as good as some of the recent Taiwanese/Hong Kong imports but none of those exist in this area. Compared to other locations of Kung Fu, I find there be a bit too much milk here. Unsure if this is part of the lack of consistency others note. If it was the usual, I'd probably give it a 3.5 and round it up but a tea chain needs to be consistent. 3.5 rounded down."

2599,6wik3tA4cRw7NA9KvNHidw,11/30/2020,4 star rating,"We are big fans of Kung fu tea. It's truly our favorite bubble tea chain in the city at the moment. The honey milk tea is incredible: try it with the earl grey tea, I promise it will be heavenly. The variety is spectacular and there's absolutely an option for every bubble tea palate. This particular location has an odd arrangement that's probably fine during pre-covid times but is awkward to say the least for this period. It's impossible  for more than one person to be inside at a time. It would be really helpful for there to be one person handling the orders and another instructing folks to wait outside for their drinks. We stood waiting for a solid 10 minutes while one maskless woman and her son did who knows what in there and refused to leave so anyone else could get inside and get the ball rolling. Their hours are also a little too late in opening for my liking - my kids are definitely hankering for their bubble tea fix around 11, so a 12 start cuts too far into the lunch timing. That said, it's truly some seriously good bubble tea. Highly recommend Kung Fu overall."

However, they're still really good, and the fruit teas here are among the best. Especially the lemon black tea which absolutely rocks my world. If it's not on the menu, demand it! Other fruit teas (Berry, Orange, Grapefruit) must also be ordered off-menu as Black Tea instead of the meh Green. Also the Lemon Black tastes good as a Lemon Oolong, but everyone else hates it because they have bad taste.Let's finish with a rap...I don't like beans in my drinks, not even MUNG FUIf you brought the tea, it's already been BRUNG FUIf you're seventeen, sorry bae, but you're too YOUNG FUBut if you want Lemon Black Tea, you come to KUNG FU!It makes some of the rivals taste like eating cow DUNG FUIt's at the top of the ladder, while you're on the lowest RUNG FUYou'll love if you're easy going, even highly STRUNG FUSo if you want a Lemon Black Tea, you come to KUNG FUI tasted it and screamed so loud that I collapsed a LUNG FUI carried on screaming and sounded like Angus YOUNG FUThey played Sting on the radio, but I'm already STUNG FUBy the wondrous Lemon Black Tea they serve at KUNG FUI went to the toilet, opened Snapchat, then I SUNG FUCame back, took my pants off, and the girls yelled ""HUNG FU!""In walked Barbie and immediately I'm SPRUNG FUAnd you should come and get a Lemon Black Tea from KUNG FU!WHAT"

It was pretty empty, but the bartenders were super friendly and attentive, the other patrons were also chill, and I had this amazing cocktail with lavender in it that I can't recall the name but it was DELICIOUS! Do I need to come back here just for the lavender drink?? I'm a bit hooked! ^_^"
2606,N-T9SPVMkAynCOCVm0OgPA,8/14/2020,1 star rating,"Drinks are fine but as one customer noted, the bartender turned our experience sour. The bar next door, Earls beer and cheese, is a far superior bar with welcoming warm staff with craft beers."
2607,N-T9SPVMkAynCOCVm0OgPA,5/17/2019,5 star rating,I'm really looking forward to the opening! The bar started to go downhill when the previous owner just wanted to sell/stopped tending to the place. In the past this bar has had almost consistently AMAZING staff in the past. And I've had the pleasure of meeting the new owners whilst walking by (and got a sneak peak of the renovations) - the New owner is extremely attentive and I truly believe he has to the ability to return the place to its former glory or better!
2608,N-T9SPVMkAynCOCVm0OgPA,10/13/2016,4 star rating,"They make a mean cocktail here! I came with some friends for happy hour, and we had some great drinks. They have $4 draft beers (only two options but Laguanitas IPA was one which is a pretty decent beer), $5 house wines, and $8 well drinks. I opted for a cocktail because I know that's their specialty. Their well drinks are still hand-crafted. They don't have premade sour mix, so the bartender made me a whisky sour with fresh-squeezed lemon and sugar and topped it off with a lemon rind. It was so good, so I had another. They also have free chips you can get with your drinks - literally fun size bags of chips that are hanging on the wall behind the bar. We grabbed some Cheetos and Fritos and were pretty happy. I will definitely be back."

2611,N-T9SPVMkAynCOCVm0OgPA,11/15/2019,2 star rating,"Cool neighborhood space and you would think friendly neighborhood vibe, but hmmm not so much. An inattentive 12 yr old looking ""bartender"" quickly turned the vibe sour. Arrived early, 5:30pm, to meet a friend - the only person sitting at the bar. Got the picture? There's only 2 of us at the bar - yet no greeting & no offer of a drink. I notice the dude is under water setting up 4 cocktails for some folks in the back, but after 10 long minutes it's finally time to ask for a drink.Note to bartender: Learn to multi task by acknowledging your patrons with a quick ""I'll be right with you"" and maybe slide over a cocktail menu if you have one - especially if your bar is pretty much empty"
2612,N-T9SPVMkAynCOCVm0OgPA,8/20/2018,5 star rating,"The Guthrie Inn made some excellent cocktails and had a breezy fun vibe that made this traveler feel right at home. Although it doesn't offer food, the Guthrie made one of the best cocktails I've had in some time. The Berry Bourbon was boozy and delicious, and I consequently enjoyed far more than I planned to on my last visit.The room is small and cozy, and the bartenders were friendly. The music varied pretty wildly between my two visits; the first evening it was a solid hip-hop playlist (I may have stealthed a couple of Shazam IDs that night). The next time was an early 00s playlist; at one point the whole bar belted out Avril Lavigne's ""Complicated"" together. It was a bonding moment.I'd certainly visit the Guthrie the next time I'm in the neighbourhood!"

Most beers are $5-8 and if you get there for happy hour it's buy one get one making it pretty affordable for NYC.It's also a great spot to stop by before a show at Mercury Lounge since it's basically across the street!

We always tip so this was out of pocket and does not make me want to come back"

During happy hour they have a deal for buy 1 beer and get another for free or something of that sort. Just hella laid back and I can't emphasize enough how helpful and chill the bartenders are."
2616,H8mnryiCI02N00g9vuFDLg,11/1/2022,2 star rating,"So I came here last night for Halloween and the vibe was definitely excellent. Halloween spirit. Rock music (I hate going to bars with loud hip hop). Drinks were a bit pricey but it is in nyc so to be expected. So, why two stars then? The bartender when I calmly said ""whenever you have a chance "" that's really all I got out before she started calling me rude and I'm yelling at her and I'm fucking her job up, yes she cursed at me. Excuse me? That's how you talk to your customers??!?! Even my friend standing next to me saw this and agreed with me and the other people at the bar. I realize it is a busy night and I have no problem waiting for my drink. She is super lucky that I am not an asshole. I believe in treating my enemies with kindness. So on a 43$ check I left her a 30$ tip and wrote on it. ""Next time be a bit more kinder."" Not everyone would be as nice as me. My buddy was begging to leave 0 but I couldn't do such a thing. Maybe she'll think twice before mouthing off to a customer again and I hope she reads this review and she'll know who it is. So after that I payed the bill and walked to the bar across the street with a much nicer bartender in a just as busy atmosphere. I hope she reads this and learns from her mistake because next time she might get someone who isn't as nice as me and will leave nothing and possibly give her an attitude back instead of just taking her shit and smiling, like I did. If it wasn't for the vibe of the place and the music I would have given the place 1 star because of the bartender last night. I have worked in bars and fancy restaurants for years and no matter how bad a customer would ever get or whatever (I wasn't even being rude)  you don't talk to them like that!"

Very friendly and homely crowd in a nice area, plus a classic jukebox with a projector playing interesting and eye catching films and videos. Very chill bar that seems fun on weekends. Search and destroy sticker behind the bar which was a bit of a bummer since the store seemed to be full of fake punks with racist and sexist imagery alongside shit service. Other than that a v nice bar to hangout at during the weekdays."

I met my friend there for drinks on a Wednesday evening and was thoroughly impressed to see that the space lived up to his description.Again, this was decried to me as a ""no frills"" bar where you can grab drinks at a fairly cheap price. It was definitely no frills in the way you want it to be though. Nice staff and wide drink selection. I can see this as the spot where locals have been coming for years on end and don't plan on ever leaving. While we were there however the music was blasting pretty loudly. We tried to escape it by moving further into the space as opposed to staying seated at the bar but unfortunately it followed us there as well. What was cool though was that they had a movie projected onto a screen on their back wall. Apparently they do this daily so I'm wondering if they have viewing events on occasion as well. Seems like that be a great thing to attend in a place like this!Overall seems like a decent dive bar in the area to possibly grab a drink with a friend. My friend and I actually went to the bar next door after since they had outdoor seating. Three stars for good service and cheap drinks."

It can get really crowded inside, so if you're dining in, the seating upstairs is nicer and much more spacious than the few tables downstairs. Food is what you would expect from any other McDonald's, and the few times things have been missing, they've been quickly corrected. Location is very convenient on 86th Street, but just be prepared to wait a little longer than some other locations."

Finding establishments that take food allergies seriously is not always an easy task . The managers at this location take the time out of their very busy schedules to listen carefully to my instructions regarding cross contamination, they even go the extra mile to fulfill my order themselves. I'd like to thank Jin, one of the managers who I encounter most when I'm there. Jin is extremely accommodating and extremely careful with the handling of my order. Thank you all."

Tbh we weren't planning on ordering from this location (read my last review abt service & delivery for clarification), but my sister misread the address (she thought this was the other 86th St location).Anyways, delivery was EXTREMELY fast. From the time we placed the order to the time it arrived, it only took 20 minutes, perhaps even less. The food was warm and tasty and DO YOU SEE THOSE BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN HASH BROWNS? We also got more condiments--extra butter and ketchup--than asked for. AND SINCE WHEN DOES MCDONALD'S OFFER COMPLIMENTARY APPLE FRITTERS? I was going to give this place 4 stars, but the free apple fritter really did it for me. Ngl it looked kinda ugly, but I had never tried the apple fritter at McDonald's before and boy was it sweet deliciousness. Will definitely be ordering apple fritters the next time around!"

The staff is okay but, a few times I had to keep saying ""excuse me"" to get their attention as they were busy on their phones or talking to each other."

It doesn't have pandan jelly but instead they have red jelly,  pudding,  ube ice cream, corn flakes,  shaved ice,  beans (not sure what kind) It's best to give it a big stir before drinking it. It was ok to be honest."

This I would maybe eat again.Cheese Pandesal - Wasn't a big fan of this version.Kalamasi drink - Not bad, just a tad too sweet for me.Service was definitely slow, but can easily be overlooked.

They didn't have a menu from what i saw or maybe I wasn't looking hard enough? They do have one online if you want to reference that with what you see. I just went by what I saw in-person which was displayed out. I had to ask what each were and saw this slice of Ube cake which was so tasty. I asked for the ube cheese cake to take home too.

The owner is super friendly and welcoming to recommend us their must-try items for our first visit. We had their Ube Cake with Flan and Garlic Bread with Cream Cheese. The food was so good, especially the Garlic Bread, it was delicious and perfectly balanced between savoriness from garlic and sweetness from cream cheese. The Ube Cake was also tasty and creamy with soft texture."

It was great/perfectly fine/didn't notice them treat anyone poorly. It was a Wednesday so not packed but a few other tables were full. We had wonton soup, shared the shrimp wonton in hot oil and the dry cumin beef and salt and pepper squid.This place had been talked up to me for a while and didn't disappoint. The soup and wontons were solid but nothing crazy. The squid was better than I thought it'd be. Didn't taste frozen, even if it was, and they didn't deep fry the hell out of it to cover anything up. The dry cumin beef was killer. Would order again. Def want to go back with more people to get more food!"

It's sad walking in to be the only table for a Saturday lunch, I remembered it when it was so packed and we had to wait for a table. Definitely will be back to support. One thing tho is their service, it's lacking because we got our food before we even got our water. Also the Dan Dan noodles and the beef noodle soup was not as full as it used to be."

It's low key ambiance is more suitable for a fast-casual dinner but the Sichuan food you'll get here delivers authentic flavors.My boyfriend and I ordered our favorite Dan Dan noodles, Beef Noodle Soup and Fried Buns with condensed milk dip. This combo made for a rather carb heavy but comforting meal. The dishes were cheap, delicious, and filled with a heavy dousing of Sichuan chili, pepper flakes, white pepper. The heat of the dishes were tolerable for even though who can't handle too much spice. We started off with our cripsy fried dough buns. These soft pillowy dough squares introduce a unique texture to the meal. Next, we enjoyed our springy Dan Dan noodles garnished with ground beef and green onions. The dish is best enjoyed after a heated mixing so the chili oil and disperse and make the noodles even smoother. The richness and fattiness of the beef and oil made this an indulgence dish. The beef noodle soup had all the richness and complexity of the beef tendon and bones coupled with some delicious noodles. This dish was my favorite since it wasn't as oily as the Dan Dan noodles. Overall, Grand Sichuan is a great choice for quality Sichuan food in Bay Ridge. Be prepared for some feisty flavors that will blow you away."
2647,83ZcxzvtHX2PmsH_wPReOw,12/8/2021,4 star rating,"This place is such a gem in bay ridge. I would've never guessed that a Sichuan restaurant near me would be so tasty. I really needed redemption with a good Chinese meal because of some not so good ones that I've been to lately. We ordered so many things to try and I was so happy. Like I wanted to cry from tears of joy and the flavor gods were singing to me.We ordered: sliced fish with red soup in hot wok (medium spice level, string bean with minced pork, Sichuan wonton with red oil, beef tendon with spicy pepper sauce, sliced pork with fresh garlic paste, and potato noodles with minced pork with sour soup.The food came out so fast and everything was super fresh. The entree portions were huge and even the appetizers were a really good size. All the meats were so melt in your tender with so much flavor, and tingly spice. I love Sichuan because of the slight numbing and tingly sensation. Appetizers: The pork with fresh garlic paste was so interesting: it was tender pork that were sliced super thin wrapped with a crunchy cucumber topped with this delicious sweetish, garlicky sauce. I put the whole piece in my mouth, like oh my god!!!!!! Same with the Sichuan wontons, I put the whole thing in my mouth. The meat was seasoned so well and the hot oil wasn't too spicy. The tendon was a tad bit too salty for my liking but it was tasty. I loved how tender the beef shank was cooked down and also there was tendon pieces in there too.Entrees: The sliced fish wok was so good because it came with a bunch of Napa cabbage and you can get rice, too. Our waitress was really nice because we wanted to split everything so my party of 4 can try each thing. We separated the noodle soup in 4 bowls. The texture of potato noodles are so cool, it's super springy and bouncy when you chew it. The sour soup worked well complimenting that bouncy noodle and salty pork. The string beans were fried and then sautéed with minced pork. The string beans had a little bite to it and was not over cooked."

I have been here countless times through the years and they have never disappointed me. My go-to's every time would be the sliced pork in garlic paste, beef tripe in hot chili oil and the sliced fish in red soup. The spice level is perfect with every dish they make. Don't feel intimated with the menu, the staff speaks english really well and will answer any questions you may have. They will even give you suggestions that matches your spice level preference."
2651,83ZcxzvtHX2PmsH_wPReOw,11/14/2021,5 star rating,"Probably the best szechuan food I've had in nyc! I ordered the sliced pork with fresh garlic paste, a twice cooked pork and the chengdu fish (less spicy). One of the biggest problems when I get szechuan food is that the food is just super spicy but has no other flavor. Some restaurants think that just loading peppers in a dish will make it authentic szechuan. I love that even tho a lot of peppers are on the food here, theres still so much flavor in the food thats not just unbearable spice. I love everything we got. Everything I had here was better than the super popular and basic szechusn places in the city. I especially loved the chengdu fish. The soup that the fish is in is thicker than usual which i found to ensure theres a lot of flavor left on the fish. It also came with cabbage, tofu and lots of peanuts that gave everything a nice texture. Will 100% be coming back here soon"

The inside bar was still crowded but we were informed that the kitchen had stopped serving food. A bit disappointing but understandable, so we ordered two glasses of wine anyway. Both were great! Typical wine bar pricing, around $15/glass. About 5-10 mins later we were told it was last call which made us feel a bit like we had to rush. The posted hours were open til 11pm so I'm not sure if this was typical or not. I'd be back to try the food, just remind myself to get there earlier!"

It was a bit of a wait (clams took 15-20 mins - we were ok with that), but they brought EVERYTHING out at the same time - including our soup. There was so much stuff on the table we had to ask them to bring the burger back to the kitchen until we were at least done eating our soup. Strange they'd bring apps out at the same time as the meal. Food tasted ok. Wished the olives were warm but overall they were fine. The burger was my favorite. The mushrooms and cheese really brought the flavor out."
2657,lhVXYTziF6ZKs7Ex4uRzqQ,5/29/2022,5 star rating,ADORABLE quaint Upper West Side wine bar. I went there for dinner last week and sat by myself at the bar and had the best time! The bartender was SO friendly and they had a great playlist on that everyone was enjoying. I ordered the salmon entree. The portion was surprisingly huge and it was maybe the best salmon I have ever had in my life. I wasn't expecting the food to be above average. It is pricey but worth it. :)

Every single item I have gotten here tastes good.As with most of this planet, prices have gone up in the past few years. But each time I eat from here, I'm HAPPY afterwards, so that's what matters.Quality establishment. I pass by almost daily, and there are always a few empty tables there, and they deserve to be filled.I rate it 5/5 by Riverdale standards, but I totally understand if people rate it 4/5 when factoring in the cost. But it's owner-run and they have used fresh ingredients for a DECADE now. Consistent! Go there. Good place."

The food was delicious we got a bit of everything. The customer service was excellent the sweetest servers make all the difference. They have so many options to choose from and they also serve wine and beer!! From Greek.  Restaurant is cozy it was able to hold out party of 9 but definitely call ahead to be accommodated with seating they were able to squeeze  us in last minute. Fantastic spot for Greek food. The spreads with pita is a great starter. The gyro and the tilapia  are delicious and cooked to perfection. The service is very nice and attentive. The Greek Coffee was great like an espresso. Love this Restaurant,such a beautiful decoration!and the food were great portion and reasonable !fast service,fresh,highly recommend it. Check out dessert very yummy would definitely visit again"

Spent a couple of hours roaming parts of Riverdale,  really just the west Bronx, and I'd done my food research ahead of time.  It looked like this was only open for takeout, but as we came upon it (lots of possibilities for lunch on Riverdale Ave!), we saw some little tables set up on the sidewalk out front.  Perfect  - and I'll almost always choose Greek food over other cuisines. I had the mesogiaki salad. Generous bowl of mixed greens in a lemon vinaigrette with probably at least 1/4 cup of walnuts drizzled with honey, chunks of apple, and 3 or 4 good slices of grilled halloumi cheese (that's what drew me to it!).  Plus, a warm, quartered white pita.My husband chose the falafel in pita and he was very pleased!  Lots of falafel, with veggies and tzatziki sauce.  He ordered a side of fries - I sampled of course  - very crisp and delicious!If I lived in the neighborhood I'd eat here at least once a week!"

Got the Greek Express Grill and Spanakopita.The Greek Express Grill was REALLY good! The chicken had good smoky char grilled flavor but was still tender. The Gyro Meat tasted very fresh and good quality.The spanakopita was also really good as well, a good mix of Feta and Spinach. Neither one overpowering.The staff was REALLY nice and everything was VERY authentic. It can be a tad pricey, but the food's taste makes up for it."

2670,K0UNoqk1PczdaiZfoMRbEA,4/2/2019,4 star rating,"Small cozy restaurant in the Bronx that serves some solid food.  First off, it is sometimes hard to find parking around especially with the construction going on.  We finally got parking and made our way in. The restaurant only has a handful of tables but it wasn't packed for lunch so we had plenty of room. We started with the spinakopita and the zucchini croquettes.  I didnt know zucchini croquettes were a greek thing but I went with it. They are served with tzatziki and were pretty good. They had a crunchy exterior and didn't taste oily even though they were fried. The spinakopita was very think and looked like it wasn't as fresh as I would expect. I know this because the dough wasn't flaky or crisp. The flavor was actually pretty good though so not the worse thing in the world.For lunch I ordered the halloumi salad since I am half cypriot and love that halloumi is popping up everywhere now. For those who dont know halloumi is a cypriot cheese that is grilled or sauteed and holds together well. It is a little salty and has a high melting point so it stays together well. The acidic dressing complimented the cheese and the freshness of the greens brought it all together.It was a quick lunch and I enjoyed it. The service was prompt with no frills. This greek food isn't stuff you would call your grandma raving about but it is solid. I like what they are doing plus they have wifi which is always a positive. Good job Greek Express!"
2671,K0UNoqk1PczdaiZfoMRbEA,2/11/2019,5 star rating,"Can I just say that I'm so happy and full right now? I became anxious when hubbs called to say he was on his way home and would pick up some take away from our neighborhood Greek restaurant. I was nervous because I just don't like the service or the food from the restaurant closest to our home but I was prepared to order something from them because I know he had a rough day and I just wanted him to be able to get home as soon as possible and decompress from all the worries he experienced today. While looking for the menu on Yelp, I searched Greek...and low and behold, Greek Express came up on my search list and the rating looked promising. Even better, they're located near our home as well. I quickly called hubbs and gave him the address as well as my order.First off, let me say that they must prepare foods with lightening speed because hubby got home with record timing. The food was warm, fresh and tasted oh, so good. I think we've found a new spot for our Meditteranean fix and any place that has halloumi has my heart!The Grub Rundown:Gyro Platter - ample gyro meat, choice of rice or fries and PLENTY of warm pita. Hubbs ordered this and, of course, I had a couple of bites for prosperity *wink wink*Halloumi - four grilled pieces of halloumi cheese, served with greens and lemon wedges. I liked this a lot but I'm sure it tastes way better if eaten in the restaurant, straight from the kitchen.Hummus - the color threw me off but the flavor is completely on point. They gave us so much warm pita for everything. We really wanted for nothing.Octopus - I took a chance ordering the octopus for take out from a place I've never eaten but after all of the rave reviews, I had to try it out. I'm glad I did. It was tender, well-seasoned and cooked well.Kourambiedes (Butter Almond Cookies) - very tasty and I'm glad I compromised the calories to try this dessert.I've already confirmed with hubby that this is our new Greek spot, no pun intended (well, maybe a l'il :D)."
2672,K0UNoqk1PczdaiZfoMRbEA,7/30/2020,4 star rating,My first time ordering they charged me $420 for a chicken gyro on a $20 delivery. They corrected it immediately food is great delivery within the hour.

The 17 min i was in there NOT ONE PERSON came out to clean the seating area (which was filthy) every table was filthy and the garbage can was quite litterally exploding over with garbage!

2684,FeiuQm8tXEmmhcm-ep8Tug,2/4/2022,1 star rating,"*** Manager Ming was extremely rude. After my interaction with him, I walked out of the restaurant without placing an order.  There's no way I would give him/them my money. ***I had just landed at nearby JFK airport. I was staying in a lodging a few blocks away. I was looking for a simple vegetarian meal. I walked into Sunny and asked the woman taking orders whether they cooked their rice in water or chicken stock. (We vegetarians and vegans can't eat the latter.) She didn't know and had to ask Ming, who appeared to be the manager. He wasn't very far in the back, but she had to call him a few times. He ""huffed and puffed"" as he approached me and asked what I wanted. I asked the question. He gave me a glare, told me they cooked it in water, and stormed back to the back of the restaurant before I could ask my next question. So, I went back to the woman taking orders, and asked whether they put lard in their beans. She didn't know and had to ask Ming again. He stormed out and told me he didn't have time to answer my questions!!I got really clear that if he didn't have time to answer my questions, I didn't have time to invest my money in his restaurant. But I do have time to write this review to warn other diners/customers. By contrast, three other nearby restaurants were polar opposites: The gentlemen in Yumze Food were very helpful.  The manager of Palma Restaurant, which is one or two doors away from Sunny, was extremely gracious in reviewing his menu. And Jasmine of Tacos Y Mas, which is where I ended up eating, was amazing -- and the food was yummy and the price was very reasonable. (See my glowing,  5-star review of them.)Key point: if you're in the neighborhood and want to avoid the wrath of Ming, you have several excellent options nearby. (I need to acknowledge that we're all human. We all have bad days. Maybe Ming was having a bad day. Even so, his behavior was extremely unprofessional. If this is the only review that speaks to it, then maybe it was an anomaly. However, if there's a pattern in the reviews of bad customer service in general, or with Ming in particular, then take your business elsewhere.)"

Ordered the chicken quesadilla with french fries, house special fried rice with lemon pepper wings and shrimp teriyaki with fried rice. The house special fried rice is not like the chinese version at all in case your wondering but it does bring a good portion to share and a lot of meat! I tried the chicken wings which werent bad and werent small. The quesadilla was okay and  reminds me of the ones they make at the tex/mex chinese restaurants. The fries however were really good. My shrimp teriyaki was tasty and had about five shrimp in all and lastly the fried rice was rather bland for my liking. Good size though. Overall the price wasnt bad for all the food(under $30.) The staff is really friendly and the place is clean.  I did notice a lot of random people come to sit down inside the restaurant for some time then they leave. That was strange for me but IDK. They only accept debit/credit for orders over $10. They have an ATM inside."

Not only did she answer, she continued her conversation with whomever, customer or coworker, never once said hold on, didn't even apologize. While she takes my order, she didn't seem to really be paying attention since I had to repeat a few items. I thank her and all I get is ""yea"". 1. I hope I don't get spit in my order 2. She needs to work on her customer service skills because it's HORRIBLE! This isn't the first time I order with her. Sunny's should really consider training her properly or hire a new person."

The food overall was great! The timing was a hour wait. The next I'll order will be only when I buying for a large group or maybe pick up.

If you are going to order from here, I highly recommend them. The only reason I can't give La Lupe a higher grade is that all of the meat was horribly dry and they don't double up on the tortillas. So, things fell apart pretty quickly. The flavors are excellent though and I might order from them again. But, next time I'll be sure to have a fork on hand."
2737,v7hwkFxrz2pORrT9Fiiovw,8/23/2021,3 star rating,I happened upon this place after a visit to my physical therapist. What attracted me is the chalk board sign advertising birria and happy hour There is a sign saying if you want to sit at the bar one must wear a mask . Agreed I simply ordered a birria and a chicken taco with a palerma to drink. I might have to edit the drink make later There are separation placards between each table and the menu is done by QR code. Once one knows what they'll like they can order from the bar tender and pay at the same time Once your food is ready he announces it and the patron picks it up from the friendly looking cooks. It is different. One serves themselves water no ice as well. I ordered a side of rice and beans and a shot of tequila . If you want casual Mexican food and a chill environment please check this place out. I also busted my tray to the right of the kitchen because it felt like the thing to do

Walked on over and headed straight to the counter. I'm having a conversation and tryna figure out what I want -not really noticing how unusually long the server is taking to take my order;it's not at all busy. He is purposely ignoring me. I'm talking anyway,so I wait till he's good n ready to take my order.             After bout 15 mins or so.  Get  the food.. walk home and realize  there are no sauces in the bag -and my order is wrong.  So damn. I walk back ..told the server politely my order is wrong and I'd like some sauces.The server takes my order to the cook and the cook says  my order is right.  I TASTED the meat at home which was chicken -I ordered PASTOR. TWO COMPLETELY different animals! Completely baffled -I left with the tacos that they finger fckd with while looking at them ... any RESPECTABLE establishment would have handled this differently. Instead, the owner would  rather defend bad service and suggesting maybe that rug industry workers deserve less than nice customers? (And has an OUTSTANDING ability to answer as if she was present.  There was no disrespect on my end to your staff)   No worries .. won't be going back. ;)"

I usually order spicy kani, shrimp tempura, and spicy avocado or salmon avocado. For such good and fresh sushi, that is the most affordable price I've seen on the island. Also, their sushi burritos are amazing! I get the  tempura shrimp burrito usually but also have liked the citrus burrito. Definitely worth trying. Even during lunch special hours, they deliver in less than 30 minutes majority of the time. I've ordered from them well over 50 times and can't wait to order again."

The restaurant is not fancy at all and kind of felt like I was eating at my friends house with their family. But nonetheless I gave it a shot and the food was awesome. The scallion pancakes are delicious. I ordered a dinner combo which actually came with egg roll AND soup, or instead of an egg roll you could get a soda instead. The egg drop wonton soup was delicious and just to my liking. But the General tso chicken was Better than most places I tried. It was crispy and savory with a good amount of sweetness. And they didn't saturate it with sauce. Also, the chicken was a perfect size and not soggy. I also really enjoyed the fried rice. It actually had egg in it which a lot of places aren't doing. I love egg in my fried rice lol.Overall I wish this place has better reviews but I personally really liked it. Oh, and the delivery service was booming, although not many people dined in."

Now, if a business does not want to honor an in-house coupon why bother offer it!Body language is a universal language. I don't need to speak Chinese to understand. This happens time and time again and now I'm really annoyed! After my very first order with this locale I reviewed my bill and the menu. I noticed I could have used the coupon, the owner never bothers to automatically offer it. (What a shame!) Since then the scenario is always the same. I order two dishes: a special combination and new dish on the menu to try it out! And every time the owner keeps asking anything to drink? My answers as  always been NO thank you! My total order always comes to be over $15.00.Now, here is the cliff hanger; WAIT... WAIT...with the combination you get an egg roll AND soup or soda. I SAY I DON'T WANT THE SOUP AND EGG-ROLL I ONLY WANT THE SODA.   My total order is always above $15.00. I want to apply my coupon for above $15.00 which entitles me a free soda.  So the freebies for my order are two soda.  I have tried the soup AND egg roll and it's not to my liking, so instead of throwing it out I forego what I don't like.AND, Every time I make sure I speak slowly and I ASK for the sodas. Time and time again the owner wants to give me wanton soup! I said I want either a seltzer, ginger ale, or sprite. When it comes to pick up my order I REPEAT MYSELF because now the owner wantes to give a no name COLA DRINK! BASTA! (Enough!)I will keep in mind about this because a really like their food as it is well balanced and not salty for my palette. I will go back when I'm in the vicinity AND UNTIL I find another Chinese restaurant that I like.  Interim, I will keep my guns loaded at all time.If you ask me, two sodas is way cheaper than soup AND egg-roll. Do you really think losing an unhappy customer over two sodas is worth IT!"

I usually come with a small group and order one of the entries/stews such as spicy pork bone & vegetable stew, or codfish stew, so far my experience has been consistently good. I especially like the side dishes. They are tasty and you can always order more for free. Although they have different side dishes every day, you never know what you will get that day.They always have seating for the smaller group if I come here before 6:30 pm. That's one of the main reasons why I come often. I know a lot of people have been complaining about the services. This place has been getting busier and busier especially because they started to combine tables to get more people to sit down. There is honestly not that much stuff considering how full this place can get. Since I always come by myself so with a party of 2. I didn't really need too much service as long as I sat down.

Not one to argue wife asked if they even tried some traditional Korean soup, they did not. So we came here on a whim ignoring all prior yelp reviews stating otherwise.Restaurant was clean and well kept, a/c blasting to tolerate anything hot, and service was kind and attentive. We order 2 starters: japche and hae mool pa junand (seafood pancake) and 4 different soup dishes: sulung tang (ox bone soup), kamja tang (spicy pork bone & potato stew), - spoiler alert: they were all Authentic & AMAZING!

I really wanted to order the Bulgogi Bibimbap, but they only offered it with a Lunch Special option, making it a little more than I wanted to spend. This came with a spicy seafood tofu soup. Since I have low tolerance for spicy food, I asked if it could be made mild. Thankfully, they were able to accommodate my request. Before our meals arrived, we were served a few complimentary little appetizers, including sizzling egg, pumpkin, macaroni salad, green squash, pickled radish, kimchi, and other veggies. This was an unexpected and pleasant treat. I really enjoyed the pumpkin, which was in a slightly sweet syrup and perfectly soft. The egg was tasty as well.Then came the soup, which was just okay for me. There wasn't that much seafood - mostly clams, which I dislike. Also, it tasted quite bland. The Bulgogi Bibimbap was pretty good. It came with plenty of vegetables and raw egg on top, which I mixed all together with the rice and meat. The vegetables were cooked well, as well as nice and fresh. The Bulgogi was delightfully tender and well seasoned, but there wasn't that much of it. Service was great. Our waitress was friendly and everything came out in a timely manner. The prices were reasonable, especially for the Korea town location."

At the end after paying  one of the busboys picked up our credit card and we were telling him that was our card, he took it away and thought it was another table after we already told him it was ours (minded he had never come to our table previously) then realized we weren't lying and gave it back to us. Naengmyeon - enjoyed it, decent portion, sweet taste, only one piece of meat in the whole dishSeafood tofu soup - comes with clams and octopus, lots of tofu, overall decentBibimbap - a little undercooked, added some gochujang for more flavoring, decent Not the cleanest (my seat had green onions on it) but typical setting (Korean music, rowdy inside, some decorations)Food: 4/5 nothing amazing but tasty food overall Service: 2/5 half the staff was rude, half were niceAmbience: 4/5 nothing out of the ordinary just could be cleaner"

We were excited to come back and do our barbecue right at our table again. This two-story restaurant in Korean town is a madhouse, but once seated we found some peace and quiet to speak. we're glad we made a reservation, people are lining up at the door during peak hours on a Saturday night. Make a reservation to avoid disappointment. We ordered the BBQ combo for 2 which consisted of marinated beef short ribs, marinated beef prime rib eye, and marinaded pork ribs. All the combo sets came with either Soo doo boo; spicy Korean tofu stew or Doenjang Chigae; soybean paste stew, we chose the latter. It also came with banchan; bunches of small plates of nibbles like sprouts, hotdogs, radish, and kimchee (they boast that their kimchee is premium), and Gyerranjjim; a Korean steamed eggs. As our server fired up the stove, our table turned festive. The servers occasionally come to our table to check on the meat, cut them and turn them and serve it to us. The staff was in a rushed mode here but it did not mean that we had to reciprocate it. It was busy but we didn't feel rushed. We had a lovely night here. We came out full, satisfied with a craving fulfilled."

It never disappoints. They give a great amount where sometimes I can finish it all myself; sometimes I can only eat half and finish the rest later. When my family visited, I ordered a bunch of dishes from here for dinner: drunken noodle, thai fried rice, shrimp dumplings, chicken skewers, and pad see ew. It was truly a hit! The only thing I wish was that they would be true to the spice level. Sometimes when we say we want medium spicy, they keep it at a mild. Maybe it is because they have customers who expect that... but not us! We want  and can handle the spice. Lol.Because I only order via DoorDash from here, I have never been inside. One day, I hope to drive all that way to finally see it in person."

I typically like ordering from this place because of its extremely flavorful crispy duck salad, which is my go to at Thai restaurants. It has plenty of veggies cashews and pineapple. Somehow it has just one leaf of romaine lettuce lol. I also ordered pad see ew which was okay. The drunken noodle was super delicious. It had peppers greens and mushrooms yum!I've ordered pad Thai and pineapple fried rice here before and don't recommend either. They're very dry and plain."

I usually order from a different Thai restaurant that costs more but I wanted to try golden Thai out since it was cheaper. The noodles are a bright red which I've never seen before in all my years of eating Thai food (the picture doesn't convey it as how it looks in person) & even the egg is dyed red! The fried dumplings was also terrible & definitely not made the same day AT ALL, $7 for 3 small & disgusting fried dumplings is a rip off."
2771,tk_hI5v8KufzFaIP57_57g,2/6/2021,3 star rating,"I hate to do this but every time I order I'm disappointed with the portion and the price..First, it was the soup, then the pad thai and lastly the curry puffs. The taste is always good but definitely not worth the price..especially because of the very small portions (even the sauce cups are filled halfway)I understand that times are rough during these times, especially for small businesses but jeopardizing the cuisine and restaurant's integrity just to make money and stay is business might be understandable but not appreciated by clientele. Hopefully, it'll get better."

The staff was kind but only informed me about being unable to change the sugar level of a drink after the drink was made and I had arrived. I wish they called to inform me before making it so I could've asked my friend if she still wanted it or if she wanted to change it to a drink that does allow for sugar adjustments. KFT should also update the app to let people know which drinks don't allow sugar adjustments rather than making every drink have a sugar adjustment option even though some do not allow it. I love their original KF milk tea with bubbles but wanted to try a new flavor as I haven't been visiting much. I tried the Rosehip milk tea and it did not taste like rose. I was expecting it to taste like rose milk tea, but it tasted like strawberry. I was disappointed, I personally don't like strawberry milk tea and felt that it was false advertising name it rosehip when it was strawberry. Tl:dr - all drinks let you change sugar level on KFT app, but in reality, some drinks do not. They made my drink and only informed me when it was made and I had arrived.

I ordered on the app for the first time because it's 95 degrees out and no one wants to stand on line for that long. On the app I ordered two drinks with the option to choose -ice option. One passionfruit green tea and Milk Green tea both with room temp ice. Of course I wanted an iced cold drink with regular ice so here I thought their app option for ice says ""room temperature"" meaning regular ice. There was only 4 choices- no ice, less ice, room temp and more ice. HOW DID I GET A HOT DRINk?!?! I went to ask if I can change it to cold they said no and that it was my fault for choosing the ice option. ?????!!. Seriously. They even wanted me to pay for the cup of ice but they gave it to me because they didn't want to remake me another drink.. how much is it to remake another drink KFT? Ridiculous. 95 degrees out and heavy traffic area. Never coming back. And Oh, they were talking smack in chinese and they didn't think I understood it because I spoke English to them."

2828,puyaYqa6h_I4DWzNBKfspA,5/2/2022,4 star rating,"This place is relatively new to the neighborhood, the only cafe and grill in a predominantly Muslim neighborhood. I first came here when it first opened, and had an Italiano panini. Their paninis are freshly made right on the spot, none of that semi warm premade stuff that most delis and grills have. I always come here for a bite to eat after school and before work, I plan on trying almost everything on the menu! Their tex-mex is pretty good too, my sister and I always get the super nachos. Overall its a great place with good service."

It has potential to be great if they just add enough of the B part. And it's too dry, add a little more mayo please. I have tried to order other vegan options from their menu but they always seem to be out."

2831,puyaYqa6h_I4DWzNBKfspA,4/9/2021,1 star rating,"I've lived in the neighborhood for a while and was always curious about trying Soho Cafe, but it was a mistake to try it out today, and I won't be going back.It started off okay - the sandwich I ordered sounded really good, and my order was marked ready for pickup within just a few minutes of placing the order. When I walked into the store, there was one woman in line ahead of me and one couple seated waiting for their food. Despite the fact that it didn't seem particularly busy, the cashier seemed pretty stressed out. She called the couple up to the counter to pick up their food, and when one of them made a request (I didn't hear what it was), she snapped at him and told him that he was going to have to wait in an impolite tone.As this was happening, another woman walked in and barreled straight past me. She got the attention of one of the guys making food and asked for a menu. Then, she took the paper menu and stood in line behind me. When the woman ahead of me finished paying, the cashier looked straight past me and asked this other woman for her order. I had been waiting there for five minutes, and in a small space with only a few customers, there's no way that the cashier actually missed me. I was literally standing right in front of the register.The woman behind me started to order, so I quickly cut in to say, ""Excuse me, I was waiting."" The cashier actually seemed annoyed with me for doing this, and the woman ordering didn't seem to care either. The cashier basically said, ""Calm down, I'll get your sandwich."" I have no idea why she would intentionally pass me over in line and then act like I was doing something wrong by informing the other woman that I was waiting. I do see now that there is a pattern of bad customer service here, so I wish I had read these reviews before ordering.Anyway, the sandwich would have been three stars. It was fine but overpriced for $9 when I could walk into any bodega nearby and get a sandwich double the size for the same price."
2832,puyaYqa6h_I4DWzNBKfspA,4/10/2020,1 star rating,"I did yelp this place before placing an order on postmates, so let me begin by saying I had low expectations as it was, but the price point was good for a basic place and they had things I was craving - nachos and a quesadilla. I was even excited that the quesadilla came with curly fries (or regular if you prefer). My order was SUPER late - I understand part of that would have to do with postmates, but my postal mate was waiting on the order for a while and these were simple things to prep. My nachos were super dry, burned, the guacamole was just sliced and brown avocado. The cheese was only on the top so the rest of the nachos were just overdone chips. Cheese quesadilla was LITERALLY melted slices of kraft cheese. What a joke. The only thing kind of decent was the curly fries but even those were soggy. I took a chance because there are some 3 star places that surprise you. This was not one of them."
2833,puyaYqa6h_I4DWzNBKfspA,8/31/2021,1 star rating,"Never eaten here but I was so hungry I decide to give it a try. They have an extensive menu and vegan options so I was excited. WORST black bean burger I've ever had, they forgot my avocado which they charged me for and my sweet potato fries were soggy and BURNT. Safe to say I won't be eating there again."
2834,puyaYqa6h_I4DWzNBKfspA,8/17/2022,2 star rating,"The only reason I am not giving one star is that I like the food and the Mexican chefs are very nice. Now for the BAD PART : the manager is nasty and knows nothing about customer service. She cops an attitude when I complained that my order has ingredients NOT listed on the menu. WHAT IF I HAVE ALLERGIES ?! I feel like we've entered a stage where customer service has utterly died. Either servers and cashiers have a nasty attitude or they act like you are bothering them. One place I go to the guy is on his cell phone regularly watching videos. But that's another story. GUESS WHAT !! I am in the service industry and my tips and reviews are dependent upon me giving excellent service. IN ADDITION, I take PRIDE in my service. You my dear need to get a different type of job. I understand you work hard, but you are consistently nasty; no smile, no hello, no thank you. Guess what : my money pays your salary. And you have just lost my business !! Was it worth it ?! Get the crappy grin off and put on a smile !! No wonder you are getting bad reviews !!"
2835,puyaYqa6h_I4DWzNBKfspA,12/2/2020,4 star rating,Found this place when I was on the bus. I like going here for my breakfast or brunch and they have good customer service and decent prices. Also lots of treats for that sweet tooth in you and now they have a coffee station for those that love their morning cup of joe. Good place to get yah grub on so pay them a visit morning or afternoon and from what I see they offer delivery through Uber eats and doordash.
2836,puyaYqa6h_I4DWzNBKfspA,1/28/2018,4 star rating,"A very good eatery that offers a lot of variety.My favorite thing here has to be the salad mixins here. They offer a fairly good selection of things to add to your salad and a lot of different sauce options. The produce is fairly fresh and its a unique service for the area that I know of. Its the only place I know in the Kensington/Church-St region that offers this and its not a service I know exists in Borough Park or even Windsor Terrace.They sell burgers, breakfast, smoothies, coffee, sandwiches, etc. They really do have a lot of variety and most of it is decent. They have good breakfast platters but some things I have had here (pancakes) have been weak compared to a nice dinner experience.The staff is fine and the place is clean. Its not empty all the time but never too crowded that you can't find a table most days. Its not loud and its very casual.Overall the variety and quality of the food here is pretty good. That alone makes it worth coming here to eat and relax."

When you walk in, it feels super TRENDY and glamorous, Cocktails were delicious according to every single person who had one. I would come back just to try more of their cocktail menu. We had the pre-fixe menu completed with a pasta dish, steak, and petite desserts. The food was honestly not that memorable to me. The ambiance however; was gorgeous and the service was very attentive to our large party. The restaurant is connected to this architecturally BEAUTIFUL staircase that leads you to the Armani store. Felt like you just walked into a fashion world's dream. Envisioning a ton of photoshoots just on that staircase alone."

We followed the server's recommendation and ordered the sea bream entree.  The skin of the fish fillet was perfectly seared.  The couscous at the bottom of the fish fillet compliments the dish really well.  We ended the 3-course dinner with the chocolate mousse dessert that comes with passionfruit sorbet.  They also brought out some mini cookies, compliments of the chef.Service was so attentive, and I saw them ironing the table cloth when they prepared for the next reservation.  I did not take a picture of the bread, but the olive oil for dipping tastes so good."

I hd a slow day at work and decided to treat myself to an upscale lunch down the street. I had read only great reviews and my experience truly lived up to what everyone says: exceptional service, tasty food, and generous portions.i started off with complimentary cauliflower foam and bread. the cauliflower foam tasted like soup - so savory nd full of flavor. The bread is also quite nice - lots of flavor, soft interior/crunchy exterior.got the crudo as my appetizer which tasted great - what makes this stand out is the quality of the fish. the spaghettini is definitely the star of the show with lemon zest to add a kick of flavor, really enjoyed this part of the mealvery happy with my experience and will be returning"

A beautiful, elegant, and pristine place for a dinner date, business lunch, or going out with the girls.  Portions, although small, are very tasty and pleasing to the palate. Not too far from the train station. Very nice decor; just take the elevator up and enjoy. Regular menu prices are not too bad. Drinks are $$$ more than your average price. Be ready for a hefty bill. Even with restautant week, our bill was $218. But the experience is well worth it, I would say."

I stopped in for dinner with friends and must say I had a great time. The waiter's were very pleasant and attentive to our table. I was here during restaurant week however as it was my first time dining here I wanted the full experience and ordered via the main menu. I enjoyed the two amuse-bouches prepared by the chef and the three different breads sent out to the table. We ordered the Manzo Affumicato appetizer which was smoked slice beef and caramelized onion- decent. The Branzino was a crispy fillet with black garlic sauce and burned leeks- everything together tasted divine. For dessert, the chocolate cake was moist and rich, the earl grey ice cream provided a nice balance to it. There were no misses.Overall Experience- 8/10. Tip: if you want pictures on the staircase it closes at 6pm so plan accordingly"
2845,zTK8reqKrmV7U71YVHYYjg,1/21/2022,5 star rating,"Visited Armani Ristorante during NYC Restaurant Week and it was a wonderful experience! The restaurant is very classy and has a very elegant aesthetic. The marble staircase connecting the store with the restaurant is very impressive and sleek. The crowd is mostly professionals which makes sense since it is located in midtown. I want to start by commenting on their excellent customer service. Our waiter was very tactful, polite and knowledgeable. We ended up spending 3+ hours there and nothing felt rushed / they never asked us to leave after we were done with food. The food was excellent. I tried the zucca squash shoup for appetizer and the pasta for main dish. Both tasted great. I was not a huge fan of the chocolate mousse I tried for desert but found it ok. If I go back, I will try the second option with the yogurt sorbet.  Overall a fun night! Highly recommend this restaurant for both restaurant week and regular dining."

When I entered, there were two parties dining, where one party consists of two young females possibility from high school enjoying their afternoon snack of pancakes and dumplings while the other consists of two middle-aged men.I ordered the vegan duck and cold jellyfish. Such items are usually served as appetizers when eating at a family gathering. The vegan duck consists of mushrooms wrapped in tofu skin while the cold jellyfish was lightly flavored.While waiting for the food, I saw that a server was making dumplings. Next to the enterance were two unopened boxes of HDTVs."

By far, the real star of the show here is the pan fried pork buns. My coworkers and I were raving about the pan fried buns here because they are so exceptionally well made. The dough is very evidently handmade -- pillowy and slightly sweet, while the bottom is crispy. Inside is super juicy (careful not to burn your mouth!). Literally you have to come here just for the pan fried pork buns because they're so amazing.They have quite a large space for Chinatown too, which is always a nice plus and service was pleasant."

For around $9 you get a decent dish with rice and soup.  They serve tea too.  I have to say the quality of this lunch dish at this price is way far exceed the expectation.  I ordered a spicy sautéed chicken and the moment you put into your mouth you will realize it is fresh right out of the wok.The only thing I have to complain about is their wifi.  There is no wifi available at this location. probably they don't know how to set it up properly.
2892,n1elkLPlnQX_PArLvuVVIg,12/7/2022,1 star rating,Came here for lunch on a Sunday and the food and service was horrible. I already have a low base for the service for Chinese restaurants and pretty much expect nothing but for them to take my order and give me food but they couldn't even do that. We sat down and waited maybe 25 mins asking 2 separate people if we could get a menu before we got one. And then had to wait forever to get someone to take our order and every step after required us flagging down multiple people. Every waiter just looked confused like they didn't know what they were doing. The food also was not good. We got the Xiao long bao (pork) and it was the last dish to arrive and at that point we were already done eating. The skin was super thick and it was not good. They also didn't give us the dipping vinegar and we had to chase somebody down for that as well. The scallion pancake was super super greasy and not flaky as well. Basically there's no reason to come here bc the food is bad and the service is somehow worse. It's a huge waste of time. Do not recommend.

Order entirely too much food and beer.If you need suggestions on food:Get all the soup dumplings (at least two more orders than you think you need), all the noodles, the boneless crispy duck if you want to get weird with it, and the Spicy General Chicken (for some reason they don't want to give Tso his due). One of your friends may pretend not to want the latter because it's sweet and inauthentic, and if he really insists then don't let him have any of the deliciousness. It's the most popular dish in America for a reason."

It's my way of saying Thank you for consistently delivering a high standard of desserts year after year. It also is very dear to my heart because they are Black woman-owned business.I heard good thinks about this place and I was planning a big themed event that needed an awesome cake. I wanted to confirm that they were indeed great before suggesting going with them so I pulled up and grabbed some cupcakes for myself and the party host to try. When I (low key cake aficionado) and the party host (self proclaimed dessert hater) bit into the blue velvet cupcake, it was love at first bite! Moist and light with a beautiful blue hue. It's all that and a bag of chips!!!The customer service is stellar online and in-store. The turn-around times are a game changer; 24 hours for a completely custom cake or dozens of cupcakes?!? And rest assured that they will be good, to your liking and fresh. I have ordered a custom print fondant cake that was the highlight of the event and most recently a dozen custom cupcakes that were ready in under 24 hours. The price is on par with the product that you receive.I highly recommend ordering from this bakery!"

2901,0iQn4DlREs7ma8OQxnU_1w,5/15/2022,5 star rating,"This is a bit overdue but still worth sharing. I wanted to treat myself for my birthday in February. I've heard great things about BCakeNY, so I decided to purchase a few treats for my personal consumption during my birthday month. Their website is a fairly easy platform to use and I really must commend them for offering such a great variety of cakes and treats which do not require the customer to step into their store. There are complete cakes for sale, as well as cupcakes with designs, cookies, and even DIY kits - all very cool and innovative. I decided to purchase 4 cake jars of different flavors (lemon, bailey's rum, blue velvet, and vanilla). The cake jars are $12-14 each depending on the flavor. They do offer gift box packs of 2 or 4 jars however, they are limited to either a liquor mix or regular mix. I have no idea what either of those includes since it isn't outlined on the site. There are pictures too but I'm not sure if they are accurate to what you'll receive. Nonetheless, I've never had their cake before and I did not want surprises, so I ordered al la carte.You can order for pick up in store, shipping, or delivery. I live in the Bronx, so getting to BCakeNY is a bit of a journey on my own. Delivery is $105, (out of the question). So, my only option was shipping, which is $25. Pretty steep if you ask me, but it covers 2-day shipping. I was hoping to get the treats on or before my birthday but that did not occur. Once you place the order, you'll receive a confirmation, then a shipping notification, but no tracking number. My birthday was the 9th, so I called on the 8th asking about the tracking number. I was graciously notified by the staff that my treats wouldn't get to me in time as there seemed to have been some error (on their part) with my address. As a result, they resent a new shipment of treats overnight via UPS. Exceptional service, if you ask me. I received the replacement shipment with no problems and on-time. The cake jars were packed secure and well presented in a cake boxed filled with colored shredded paper. Again, I ordered lemon, bailey's rum, blue velvet, and vanilla cake jars. All tasted very fresh and require immediate refrigeration. The cake itself wasn't as great as I had anticipated but they were good enough that I would have it again, I just wouldn't say this was my go-to place for all of my special occasions. The texture was pretty moist and the flavors were mildly sweet, without being overpowering. The buttercream frosting was tasty, its texture being light and creamy; I'm guessing it was oil or fat based because it solidified when refrigerated. The blue velvet came with cream cheese frosting, which was a little too sweet for me. Among my favorite, I enjoyed the vanilla and bailey's rum cake the best. The latter wasn't overpowering which I was surprised about. It had a nice tinge of the rum that when combined with the moist, sweetness of the cake, it creates a nice mouthfeel. I would suggest allowing the cake jars to sit at room temperature for a few minutes before eating, so that you can really enjoy the flavors. Once I started doing that, I really got to taste and enjoy the cakes. Overally, I enjoyed my cake. It was a great treat to celebrate my birthday. I also commend the staff because they were very helpful whenever I called with questions or concerns. I'd definitely return but it's not at the top of my life due to distance and essentially, I didn't fall in love with the cake. Five starts all around for great service and good cake."

Looked for the email and found it [didnt respond to the email] she then went on to tell me it is easier to just order online.... okay We went online. And my boyfriend wasn't comfortable so he went IN PERSON to order the cake. You would think if you go in person, talk to someone, there is no way to fudge the pooch-- wrong! After showing them a whole picture. [although they had it in the email] They messed up the cake sooooo bad. It's like they didn't even check for quality before they let it leave the store. The number 12 was bigger than the cake itself. NOOO decorations just one symbol on the cake. It was like a horror situation of what I asked for VS what I got. I did call and express my concerns and frustration. They then allowed us to bring the cake it to be fixed. The fix was doable. But you spend 200$ on a cake. You shouldn't have to go behind them and tell them how to do their job. Cake tasted good. I give them that. Red velvet. One star for taste"

The place looks as if the color orange vomited on it and they didn't bother cleaning up. Not only do they have Christmas ornaments hanging, but they have Christmas lights as well. They have signs written in marker, one of them saying ""Cash Only"", which is unfortunate. I was going to order an $8 meal with my card but only had $3 in cash which bought me a chicken taco.First things first, the ""tex-mex"" food is made by Asians. I have nothing against them other than the fact that I don't believe the food tastes Mexican. In fact, the chicken in the taco tastes like chicken teriyaki. I could only imagine that's what they're using. The taco comes with chicken, lettuce, tomato, and American cheese, wrapped in a flour tortilla. To be honest, the poor quality can only be excused by it's cheap price. At least it doesn't taste horrible, but I would just rather eat at Taco Bell."

I decided to eat the soup in the restaurant. The soup had broccoli, white button mushrooms onions and a piece of grilled chicken cutlet cut into slices.  It tasted more like Chinese soup than Mexican. I was given one small pack of  pico de gallo.  I used that for the soup. Since i wanted one for the taco when I was done with the soup I asked for another container of pico de gallo and I was given it.  When I ate the shrimp tacos, it contained 4 shrimp, shredded cheddar cheese which was not melted lettuce and diced tomato.Both the shrimp and the chicken was well seasoned., moist and tasty.  The chicken was grilled which was a surprise since it was in soup."

Also, really didn't care for the rush job by staff as ordering and stopping by continually as to our possibly ordering more.  His asking us to put the spent wings on a plate for him to take away during one visit was just so over the top.  Drinks may be reasonable, but there's really no reason for me to return here.   Just a really weird dining experience."

Menu wise, there are a lot to choose from. Ideally, I wish they would have a popo platter that you'll see on Chinese menus so I can have a selection of appetizers instead of having to make the hard decision to narrow it down with one or two. In the end, we shared the calamari and wing appetizers and I ordered my own chicken pad thai. Both appetizers were fantastic. Highly recommend them both, esp the wings because it's done so nicely. Though for my pad thai, I thought it was okay. It didn't have the wok hey (charred flavor) so yeah, just thought it was okay. As for customer service, I love how quick and efficient the worker were.

Just to preface that I usually expect massaman curry to be more on the sweeter side of curries and to be thicker yet very flavorful with chunks of vegetables. I did not really get that with my dish. The flavors were not as intense and only lightly sweet and the vegetables did not seem to have absorbed the flavors from the curry. It was also a little off putting biting into larger pieces of onion and soggy peanuts.However, the portion size was generous and came with a side of white rice for a reasonable price.

Everything came out within 10 minutes of ordering, which is almost a little too fast because most of it ended up being lukewarm. The taro spring rolls were the best dish by far but the curry and pad thai didn't have a lot of flavor. we also forgot to ask for a higher spice level so maybe it was just super mild? The servers were very attentive though and the lychee martini pitcher we ordered wasn't watered down at all. Would recommend getting pitchers or coming for happy hour deals"
2925,nFszVPUX4tj-oarjfBO0nw,3/20/2023,4 star rating,"I was short on time for lunch and I figured I'd be able to get some good thai in NYC. This place was a few blocks away from my hotel and had some pretty good reviews. I ventured over, but I couldn't find the entrance. The restaurant is next to the dumpling place, you can see the signs for the restaurant, but no signs for where the entrance is. So, for those who plan on visiting, the entrance is to the right of a stair case that goes up. There are 2-3 steps down that lead to the entrance. Anyway, like many places, I preview the menu so I don't waste too much time. And with most thai places I go to, I usually get the massaman curry. This was no different. But, I didnt realize they offered a lunch portion, on a Sunday. I got it with crab rangoons, as an appetizer was complimentary. These were lunch portions, as well. 2 round rangoons, which were fine. Don't let the yellow interior color throw you off. They were pretty good, along with the chili sauce they were in. The massaman was interesting. A different flavor than most massamans I have had. This one seemed to be on the sweeter side, almost tasting like nutmeg. It threw me off for a minute, but the taste grew on me. It was pretty good. And the portion was the perfect size. The entree also came with a free soup or salad, but I declined, even though it was free. And an even better part? This meal cost me $13, plus tip. Not a bad deal for NYC.."

I tried a few of the other spaces on the property (Bar, restaurant, rooftop). They all fit the vibe of the hotel.

We called hotel staff to unlock the door and after 5 attempts and 40 minutes, they finally were able to unlock the door. We were outside in 30 degree weather and I only had on a dress. I had enabled the safety lock on the door while we were getting dressed, which became another issue. They had to break through the door lock in order to get into the room. Once inside, they unlocked the balcony door and inspected it. We were told the door shouldn't, but it has an auto lock that the staff should be more aware of. It's dangerous for families staying here as well; god forbid a child got locked out.After getting out, we missed our dinner reservation so the night manager escorted us down to the restaurant. We waited for 10 minutes so the night manager could inform us the restaurant was full due to an error on their part with the booking system. At this point, the night wasn't looking great as we had nowhere else to eat!They tried to offer us a lobby couch and a small table to have dinner on, which is not what either of us were picturing. After another 15 minutes they pulled a table and chairs from somewhere and gave us a makeshift place seating. We were the only ones in the restaurant not having the same romantic dinner experience as anyone else. Dinner was okay, but you're better off going somewhere with better food.Overall I was very disappointed with the experience, seeing how the Candlelight Series hosted there made us want to stay! If you choose to stay here beware, you might be stranded on your balcony with staff who will tend to you at their own convenience."

This is one of my favorite rooftops in NYC, with one of the best views of the skyline.This rooftop has it all - views, food, drinks and live music. There are three main areas you can chill at.- Poolside: If you're looking to sit, chill with friends, have some food and a drink with some background music that's the place for you.- The Rooftop Bar: If you're looking for an outdoors party, go hang by the DJ booth. Grab some drinks at the bar and you'll be sure to have a fun dance party. - The Water Tower: This is my favorite of the three. Floor-to-ceiling glass windows with an amazing view of the skyline. Beautiful lights that give the place an intimate vibe. A small area to make it feel like you're in someone's living room. And of course, live music to make sure you're dancing the night away.In terms of food... We kept it super simple and ordered:- Chips & Guac: The Williamsburg Hotel is one of the ONLY places I've been to with more than enough chips to go with more than enough guac. It was the perfect serving for a group of 4. And it was obviously delicious since there was not even one chip left.- Baja Fish Tacos: I was SO surprised by these. These were SO good!! The fish were cooked to perfection and were actually crispy - which I loved! The sauce was on point and honestly the perfect complement to the fish - it was a Chile Arbol Aioli, and was just the right amount of spicy and creamy. Delicious. These are definitely on the smaller side so keep that in mind depending on how hungry you are!For drinks, I tried the Laguna Sunrise, and was very happy with my choice. It felt like I was sipping on Orange and Cantaloupe juice, but with a hint of sweetness/flora to it (which was probably due to the saffron). Loved it.Only reason I'm giving this place a 4 and not a 5 is that it's actually easier and quicker to get up and order directly at the bar than at your couch/table, which was pretty counterintuitive. If you want a couch/chair/table and want a break from dancing/standing around all night, make sure to grab a reservation at sevenrooms.com/reservati… - Shoutout to Austin who was super nice and super helpful in getting us booked at the greatest area!"

This was my first time at the Williamsburg Hotel Rooftop Bar and it certainly won't be my last. We didn't stay long as I didn't have a jacket and it got really chilly, despite it being a beautiful day in November. To get to the bar, you walk over by the elevators and wait in a line to get on to go up. The line was short so we got up within minutes of walking in. The views were gorgeous and I could only imagine hanging out here on a warm summer night. I didn't eat or drink so I can't tell you how that is but I can surely tell you that this is where you want to come for a fun night out."
