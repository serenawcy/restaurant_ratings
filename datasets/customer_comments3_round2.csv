We ordered a miso soup, a sashimi plate, and three rolls to share. I myself do not eat sashimi typically and prefer sushi, but I tasted a bit of the tuna sashimi which was incredibly fishy. The three rolls we ordered were bad- the rice was stale and the seaweed was chewy. The two of us ate one piece each of the three rolls and couldn't eat any more of it. Maybe it was an off night, but it was not for us. That being said, the wait staff was friendly, attentive, and efficient."

The sushi was pretty good but I really expected to be wowed and I was just content (#imclearlyspoiled). The menu is pretty limited, which I saw as proof that 1or 8 was legit and the fish was fresh etc but the meal wasn't super memorable. For the price and reputation I expected more but still - 4 stars and a really solid (and even maybe one of the better) sushi choice in this neighborhood."

We stepped into the restaurant and were a little nervous as there weren't many people seated, as we made our way back into the restaurant, we realized there was more life and the front was more of a bar. We started off with a special which was fried chicken dumplings, essentially they took apart the wing, stuffed it with dumpling and then fried the wing. It was killer! Then we had a couple of pieces of nigiri, classic and always good. Then, a spicy tuna roll and a yellowtail roll. Seriously, I'm not being dramatic when I say that this was the best Spicy Tuna roll ever, we ordered 3 of them.This place is good, tucked away in Brooklyn but absolutely worth the visit. Don't forget the Spicy Tuna, I promise you will regret not getting it."

They have an excellent selection of munchies, ranging from quick bites to whole plates, and all of it excellent.The food *is* stellar, thats for sure, but the real star of the show is the sake. Ken, who mans the bar out front, knows his sake, and they have an excellent selection to pick from. There are quite a few by the glass, but if you can, go for the bottles - they are *varied*, and happy-making across the board.Yes, it is a bit pricey, but then again, that's williamsburg for you..."

5,MM5P9cKlzovYLcf5qf2SwQ,5/6/2021,5 star rating,"This strange name is from Japanese phrase Ichi ka bachi,  means challenging your luck.It took me a while to get the meaning since we don't use this phrase that often anymore.Their Japanese dishes are all superb!  I was really impressed by their elaborate cooking and display.Shishito peppers were plump and fresh, best I ever hadeven in Japan or Spain where it's very popular, too.Kimpira was tender and mild, too mild for me. I like strong soy sauce and sugar plus  chili taste better.Broiled Saba( mackerel) was juicy and fresh.Wish it came with daikon oroshi ( shredded? radish )Tonkatsu ( pork cutlet) was not sliced. Wondered why!Also not much cabbage ( must for Japanese)Salmon skin cucumber role was very tiny and not much  salmon skin in it. For the price it is wimpy.Rose wine by the glass $9 was cool and easy to go with our food.The service was polite and professional.We ate outside, bit chilly, so hope to sit inside ( looked very elegant) very soon.Also a little bit more easy reading menu on the glass window and store name.Too quiet PR around this busy restaurant row area."

This very may well have been the best sushi I have ever eaten in my life and I very much look forward to returning. The service was impeccable and atmosphere made me want to do a chill tango."

Overall, it was just okay for me. My favorite sushi piece was the Hokkaido Scallop or Hotate with Shisho and Yuzu. This piece melted in my mouth. Scallop was nice and sweet."

I know we're going through inflation so whatever ... my 2 friends and I stopped by after we had lunch somewhere else and stayed for a couple of hours catching up. they did not rush us or anything even though we just ordered a pitcher and 2 appsVery chill atmosphere. The staff was attentive and the owner was nice and seemed very grateful to have us there."
11,LyCE268_fz_MAZieFZY1lA,2/2/2022,5 star rating,"El Cantinero is nothing fancy, but it really hit the spot for some margaritas and chips on a recent weekday afternoon. Located centrally in Greenwich, El Cantinero is somewhat of a hole-in-the-wall spot, and, complete with its low ceilings and Christmas string lighting, really reminds me of the family-run Mexican spots I grew up eating at in Texas. I am always on the hunt for a taste of home, so we sought out El Cantinero when in the city recently. We decided to sit on their covered and heated sidewalk tent, and ordered a pitcher of quite strong margaritas and their chips and salsa, which really hit the spot. We enjoyed whiling away the afternoon chatting andpeople watching in one of the city's most beautiful areas. El Cantinero is the perfect spot for a taste of authentic Tex-Mex in the middle of Manhattan."
12,LyCE268_fz_MAZieFZY1lA,10/6/2022,3 star rating,"Once again here we are after quarantine for the first time. My margaritas were good but they were taking long to bring our drinks. I had to ask twice in order for them to bring my drinks. Also,  we order some nachos and they were not so good. Then, the waiter Osvaldo/ Oswaldo had the audacity to complain about the tips we left after we told him that our drinks were taking forever. We left a percent of tips based on the amount that we consumed and the service. Tips are always a suggestion based on the service provided and as a previous food inspector I know. After that, he went and was asking if his service was good enough."

18,LyCE268_fz_MAZieFZY1lA,6/23/2022,2 star rating,"This place was really overpriced and bad. I got a chicken quesadilla which was tasteless. I could taste that the chicken was boiled and had no flavor whatsoever, on top of that it was $20. On the contrary, the mango margarita was pretty good and because it wasn't happy hour it was $15 which is what an average drink would cost.My friend got the nachos ""deluxe"" and what came out was 10 chips topped with salami and cheese and half of the plate filled with lettuce. The place next to them looked better and had an happy hour until 7, so i would recommend the place next to them"

20,rPXlTqHLYKcXyADOeqzwbg,5/6/2017,4 star rating,"This is a Starbucks, so I'm primarily rating them based on their service and location. Their service is pretty good. The staff is pretty friendly and I've never received any sort of ""attitude"" from them.They don't have a lot of seating  and the place is a bit cramped and rush hour can be a bit inconvenient. I don't usually hang out at Starbucks' so it isn't an issue for me as I'm generally in and out. But, if you like to sit down and enjoy your order, probably not a place for you."
21,rPXlTqHLYKcXyADOeqzwbg,3/12/2018,1 star rating,I don't think so.I LOVE Starbucks.  This location leaves something to be desired.   I wanted to purchase a gift card.  The cashier had some difficulty programming the card.   He asked me to wait a moment and someone would help me.AND.....there I stood.   And stood.   And stood.    Does anyone follow up?   I finally lost my temper and someone came to assist.     Very disappointing.    Poor service.   Staff was busy all around the store talking and having a good time.   Won't be going  back.
22,rPXlTqHLYKcXyADOeqzwbg,4/30/2011,3 star rating,"This Starbucks handles mostly a work crowd, but they deal with weekend tourists with aplomb. There's a modicum of seating, but their bathroom queue takes awhile since everyone and their mother is always trying to go.If you're around Battery Park, they'll do if you just want to pop in and out. Friendly staff."
23,rPXlTqHLYKcXyADOeqzwbg,6/25/2015,5 star rating,"This is the friendliest Starbucks in the entire fidi, but always swamped with tourist looking for a reprieve.  Coffee always fresh and my flat white is an actual flat white, not a faux latte filled with the 2-3"" of foamy grossness."
24,rPXlTqHLYKcXyADOeqzwbg,1/18/2017,1 star rating,"I have been coming here every day for more than 10 years, they are in my building. The staff there is usually friendly, and some of the guys there actually joke with their customers on occasion. Today, I was unfortunate enough to be serviced by one of the rudest people I have ever encountered...don't know her name but she is a short, chubby, African American woman who just cost Starbucks a loyal customer...I will never go back thereHere is what happened:- A friend of mine in front of me ordered a Pike roast coffee and received it right after he paid for it.- I ordered a Pike roast coffee, paid for it and she immediately took the next customer (made me wait on the side)- The guy that was in back of me ordered a pike roast, paid for it and she made it for him right away (at this point I am confused but didn't say anything...continued waiting patiently)- A 3rd guy ordered the same coffee as I did  (tall Pike) and she made it for him right away.At this point I asked her if she was making mine....she asked me what I ordered and I replied that it was a tall Pike...she took the 3rd guys order and gave it to me. When I asked why she made me wait, she replied ""I only have 2 hands"". When I went to question why she was making coffee for everyone else and not me, she just turned around to end the conversation.Management should really do a better job at assessing their employees at that location. Absolutely everyone else there are so nice and pleasant....this lady should really not be working there. Hey...it's Manhattan and they will make tons of money without my business, but I am never going in there again and making sure none of my friends do as well!"
25,rPXlTqHLYKcXyADOeqzwbg,6/5/2019,1 star rating,Came by today (Jun 5) to try and order a late night coffee. Lazy employees closing the store at 945 when it is supposed to close at 10.... they shake their heads at us that they're closed. Starbucks managers needs to look into this and make sure these clowns are working their full shifts.
26,rPXlTqHLYKcXyADOeqzwbg,5/25/2016,1 star rating,"The barista working the bar on May 18th at around 1:50 pm was the rudest person I've ever encountered taking my order anywhere. She literally yelled at me because I didn't tell her I was scanning my phone to use the app. She seemed so pissed, like she wanted to fight me. This was nuts!!!!!!!!!! Also, this occurred right after someone's order was taken behind me..Another time one of the workers was coming in for their shift. I was waiting for a drink at the beverage bar and she literally pushed past me saying EXCUSE ME!!!!!!!!! Knocking me over to one side. Seriously?"

28,rPXlTqHLYKcXyADOeqzwbg,12/30/2017,5 star rating,"I would 1000/100 recommend this Starbucks!! It's my favorite out of all the ones I've been, so I was kind of surprised to see the low stars. I take the ferry to work every morning and when I need coffee I always make extra time to stop by this location, even though there 2 others right by the ferry. I've never had a problem with any of the staff and the drinks always come out really delicious. There's one barista in particular that is outstanding, but unfortunately I didn't ask for his name (basic functions like that are non-existent for me around 7 am lol). He's always very courteous and polite and today he was sweet enough to give me a free upgrade because they didn't have the ingredients for the drink I wanted."

30,WWHsb35bc_39qSIc1f-pGw,7/3/2018,3 star rating,"Good acai bowls, but not the best. I had the one with peanut butter and it really hit the spot after hours of volunteering in the park on a 90 degree day. Most smoothie places have an option to turn your smoothie into a bowl and add toppings, but you can't do that here. Although they have the option to make your own acai bowl, I was disappointed at how rigid the employee was when I asked for one of the smoothies as a bowl. She made me feel like I was crazy for asking this. It's basically the same thing as making your own acai bowl but just having a smoothie as the base... And I even saw that they had smoothie bowls on the online menu. Anyway, the acai bowls here are not bad but there are other places that have fresher ones for a similar price."

They literally are the nicest people, I usually get the acai bowl and they make it nice and pretty and take their time. I had the complete opposite experience here. The store was nearly empty and the girls working were so rude. I ordered the acai bowl and it was nothing like what I usually get. Absolutely disappointed. And when I asked them why it didnt have the usual coconut and honey they said it doesn't come on this kind of acai bowl. I thought it would at least taste okay but she didn't blend it well and it's actually like eating sand, with chunks of ice. What a disappointment"

36,WWHsb35bc_39qSIc1f-pGw,8/4/2018,1 star rating,"Lately the female employees who have been hired here have really turned me away from visiting. Particularly the woman who works at the front counter on Saturday nights - she should definitely not be in customer service. She insists on touching the one sample cup allowed for each customer. Never a welcome, never a smile. Just a disgusted look when you ask for a sample cup. I took two and she grabbed the second one back straight up out of my hand. Management reading this - you want customers? Send your employees to Cust Service Training 101. Or let them go for incompetence."

The selection was fine. I mixed in salted caramel with a cookie flavor. The toppings were standard. I was excited that the line was short considering it was 12 pm on a very hot day. This line took so long. We were standing there while our frozen yogurt was melting. The cashier was taking a very long time to ring up customers. There are two cash registers and there were two cashiers in one. There was a man in front of me that insisted on hearing all items on the menu in detail. It wasn't until someone behind began to complain that the cashier opened the second cash register.  I agree with other reviewers my cup was over $6. At that point, most of it melted.  They should really consider opening an additional cash register when the line is long.It is frozen yogurt and it does not stay frozen for long!"

Starbucks online had a sale going for the weekend buy one holiday drink get one free. YAY!!!!!!!!! Honestly I would have no problem ordering two for myself! ahah... but my boy came along (just means get to get bigger sizes and still try to different drinks because hes good at sharing :)) There was a line, but I thought it would be worth it.  Waited about ten minutes in line. Waited another ten minutes for our drinks. I ordered a Caramel Brulee latte. GROSS. Where was the caramel? Where was the flavor of the crisped sugar on top? WHERE WAS THE ESPRESSO!?!? Really I'm pretty sure there was NO espresso in this drink! WTH.They either was so busy they forgot or they forgot to change out the beans between orders.. IDK.. but there was no espresso! It literally tasted like warm watery milk. ICKKKKKKKK. The boy ordered a peppermint mocha. Same problem with the mocha, NO ESPRESSO!! There was way less mocha chocolate than normal too. It was like a really watered down hot chocolate that wasn't even mixed well! The only thing they did put in it was WAY TOO MUCH MINT SYRUP. ughh its was overwhelmingly alchol-y tasting. GROSS. I've ordered enough of these exact drinks at other Starbucks' to know what the normal range in variation tastes like... These drinks couldn't even be compared to my least favorite drinks in the city. In fact I accidently dropped a whole drink and spilled it everywhere. 3/4 was still left and I DIDNT EVEN CARE! Not caring that you dropped the majority of a $5 drink is not normal...  WORST STARBUCKS EVERRRR."
49,dtSIpPFoQDxQ4UwLOD1iUg,8/5/2014,1 star rating,I see that a lot of people complain about the fact that it's busy. Well I believe that when you go to the mall you should expect every place in there to be busy. Especially the only coffee place. Especially when people who work there look out for people who work in other stores in the mall and make their drinks before yours even if they are at the end of the line. Sure I understand they need to go back to work and it's nobody's concern what you need to do after a mile long coffee line. Anyway I can wait even through that for my best tasting cup of coffee. See in this shoppe though I haven't gotten any great tasting coffee like in any other Starbucks. My boyfriend lives across the street from the mall so it's only natural that we'd come here for coffee. But NEVER AGAIN. In the past 6 months every time we've bought my red eye in there it always ended up in the garbage cause the coffee is badly burnt. It's not drinkable. So I might as well through money in the garbage. Saves me the trip across the street. Don't they have some quality control from Starbucks corporation???

I ordered a detox juice which has apple cucumber kale and ginger. Definitely sounds like it can cleanse my body. The juice settled into different layers when I got it, it looks very healthy and appetizing. It's refreshing in a sense where it's easy to drink, not too sweet or heavy. You can taste the fresh cucumber and kale taste and a hint of ginger pungency. Highly recommend this over a smoothie if you have eaten a meal before."

They're a local business that I'm happy to support as they don't skimp on the toppings and offer the option to customize any of their signature protein shakes. Straight off their menu, I highly recommend ""Thicker than a Snickers"" :)"

Great to have after a gym session or just on the run! Their shakes and açaí bowls are so good and you can customize anything although their menu staples are already amazing! I've been getting the powerhouse bowl a lot because it already has protein in it and it's so yummy! I would also recommend the bunch of oats shake!

It was refreshing on a hot day, but nothing special. The smoothie was also a bit muddled in texture and left a heavy aftertaste.I ordered for curbside pick up, but upon arriving and called the restaurant they said I can come in to pick it up.... then what is actual curbside pickup? I wanted to minimize contact with people in the store, so I opted in for curbside pickup and so that they can bring the order to me. -_-"

I ordered a Bayside acai bowl with NO granola and almonds due to dietary restrictions and allergies only to find out my request completely went unheard. I understand if it was busy as work orders can get confused but I was the ONLY customer and repeated it twice.. NO ALMONDS AND NO GRANOLA. A complete waste of my time and automatically trashed. Terrible. Will not return again. Suggestion, lower the music volume if you cannot hear customers orders correctly."

We had the shrimp wonton soup, the beef and broccoli platter, the duck lo mein & the spring rolls last time we ate here, everything was very good. Just we aware of two things:1.

They won't tell you and it will be very hard to read in the check since it's handwritten, but I did the math, in multiple occasions and they do charge for it. So unless they treat you like royalty, I wouldn't double tip. I fall for it many times because I didn't know, but one day I double checked because the math didn't make sense and I figured it out. When I asked the server he looked pale and gave me a shy smile... so now I know. 2. Unfortunately even though they have a cozy atmosphere inside I would eat outside only, because not so long ago we had lunch inside and they were not enforcing the vaccine card verification, we felt a bit uncomfortable, but there were no tables available outside, the waiting list was long and I was in a hurry. *** I went after this new covid wave started two weeks ago and they did check my card and ID. So I cannot assure they don't or they do regularly as I have had to completely different experiences within a month. As crazy at it looks, I've been to at least 4 places in the last month in Chinatown and none of them verified guests vaccines cards. I am a bit nervous yes, but I haven't had covid since this started and not planning on getting it any time soon. Lol. So yeah, this kinda stuff is important to me. That's why I'm giving 4 stars.

80,iV5yy8EbjsPoYWtjRhB61Q,5/12/2018,5 star rating,"My bad, I did not realize they were cash only. When I made reservations, that probably should have been brought up. But I had to be a big shot and tell the owner that I had dined their previously when asked. This a an Italian restaurant that has a Sicilian chef that is friendly and accomaditing. The dining room has limited tables, and the restaurant can be somewhat tight when seated. But that all does not matter whatsoever because the chef can really provide you a dining experience that you will not forget. We had the muscles and cauliflower as appetizers, and I had the home made pappardelle pasta with mushrooms. What a wonderful delicious meal. We had also cannoli for dessert which was the best we ever had. Why? Because they were not sugary sweet, just perfect. Just one issue seem to present itself. We had an early seating, and the chef's partner was making some of us feel anxious by rushing us through dinner. I get it, he did not know us and was afraid we might make it a four hour tour.  I don't care, the meal was fabulous,  but I will next time take the later seating."
81,iV5yy8EbjsPoYWtjRhB61Q,6/27/2022,5 star rating,Best Italian food in NYC.  Salads & appetitzers are fresh and delicious; pastas are absolutely incredible and flavorful.  Giuseppe's hospitality is also unparalleled.  Highly recommend!!
82,iV5yy8EbjsPoYWtjRhB61Q,10/24/2020,1 star rating,"Really wanted to like this place, but have to say the experience was not for me. We came here because my boyfriend loves gnocchi and we had heard good things about theirs.Found out the place was cash only and asked about an ATM on site, but was directed to one around the corner-- not a crazy deal breaker, but I think in 2020 if you're going to be a cash only place in NYC that enforces a $40 minimum per person... maybe have an ATM on site? Service here is... strange? You have one person taking your drink orders and then another actually taking your food order? Ok sure. After taking our time to decide our drink choice and food choice we ordered a bottle of wine with who we thought was our server and tried to order our entrees, but was then told our sever would be with us to take our order. Server arrives and was this guy we observed earlier chatting up and laughing with other tables when we first arrived. Based on reviews, I think this guy was the chef? We tell him this is our first time here and he responds with excitement about telling us what this place is all about. So I think ""Oh, nice. We're going to get some really awesome service and leave super happy and laughing like those other people."" Nope. Attempted to order, but was cut off. Server then proceeds to recite by memory all of the specials and appetizers -- basically reading the menu (all of this was listed). I get the novelty around this, but it honestly went on for an awkward amount of time especially given the fact that we already had our menus for 30+ minutes and ordered drinks already. Maybe it was the wine, but my eyes started to glaze over a bit.When we finally get to order, he asks us if we'd like an appetizer and I politely decline as I wasn't super hungry at the time (late lunch). He then proceeds to ask my bf the same and he had to decline twice as the sever kept pushing us to share one. Honestly, we didn't appreciate being made to feel bad about not ordering appetizers. Bf got his gnocchi and I got the mushroom truffle pasta and the food was really good.Unfortunately, we got pretty much no attention afterwards and my bf pointed out the server/chef-man visited and chatted up every table except ours after. This is a small place so it really left us feeling like a second rate table. Didn't help that we were seated in the dark at the boondocks with world's smallest table.Needless to say we skipped out on dessert because we just wanted to leave at this point.Some might find this place charming, but I feel like if you don't fit a certain profile of clientele you really get treated differently. We had a good laugh about it after, but we won't be back. There are plenty of great Authentic Italian places in the UES with food just as good that don't force an ""experience"" on you.tl;dr: Cash Only. Food was good. Condescending staff. Maybe get takeout instead (if they even offer it)"

88,iV5yy8EbjsPoYWtjRhB61Q,9/22/2018,1 star rating,"This is the most accurate 1 star I could have ever given. I am almost thinking about upgrading the others. A friend of mine comes from NJ and wants to eat pasta. I yelp and get Nica Trattoria with great reviews. We get there and get a table. The host was an older gentleman, which seemed to know how to do his job. Anyway, we should have noticed that something is off when he took the order from the table next to us and the customer says something like  ""I would order if you'd let me and not be so in my face"". I didn't eat, as I was not hungry, but my friend ordered a Caprese salad, seafood pasta and we both ordered San Pellegrino and a wine, which was the 3rd most expensive bottle. Around $100 worth. He eats, we drink etc. We still have wine in our glasses and I see my friend getting uncomfortable. I ask him why and he says he thinks the older gentleman wants us to leave. I am like ""no way, the tables are empty, it's just 830pm, we still have wine"", but Lord behold!!! The host comes to me and says ""we will need the table soon"". We were there for about 1 hour, with a bottle of wine bought. I turned and said ""we still have wine in our glasses"". He said ""oh no, take your time"". Really? My friend felt extremely awkward by the whole incident and wanted to leave. THE ABSOLUTE WORST TREATMENT I HAD TO EXPERIENCE IN AN NYC RESTAURANT and I've been here for 4 years. The most deserved 1 star rating I ever gave. Oh, and don't get me started on cash only and other ""house rules"". Anyway, us, as patrons, are to blame as well, if we accept being treated like crap or even more considering that ""wow, this must a good place"". Needless to say, never coming back!Additional comment: Someone added the photo below to point out the ""house rules"". Like I said in the review: we were there waiting for 30 mins for the food, 1 hr to enjoy and we bought 1 BOTTLE of wine. If the owners think I am an alcoholic to drink with a friend a bottle of wine in 1.5 hrs they have the wrong person. Please New Yorkers, avoid these kind of places, that are mediocre at best and pose as fancy places just because they are rude."
89,iV5yy8EbjsPoYWtjRhB61Q,12/8/2019,5 star rating,"This is to this day (not to say that it won't change tomorrow), my favorite 'authentic' Italian in the UES. It is very small, only 8 tables, cozy, hole in the wall feel. The chef, staff, host, owner are friendly, talkative, informative, and it seems everyone has been going there for a long time. It transports you to feeling that you are truly in Italy, which is a rare occurrence for NYC. The restaurant is cash only, which adds to the authenticity.  The menu is small, and also talks about the history of its Sicilian origins how authentic the restaurant is. I am on the hunt for the best gnocchi in the city, and to this day, I have found the best gnocchi here. Right here in the UES. It is soft, pillows, billowy, melts in my mouth. It is heaven. This is your classic, authentic, italian that people travel all over the world to NYC to try. It is absolutely worth whatever it takes to find yourself at a table here."

We got to enjoy several lovely songs during our meal which was such a great experience. They are all super friendly and provide great service as well. Definitely the highlight would be our server counting out change while singing beautifully! So impressive.The food was also great! I got the Yankee Doodle burger (that is topped with Mac n cheese) and waffle fries, highly recommend. Others in my party got the chicken fingers (well seasoned and flavorful) and the chicken pasta (also good). We were lucky to go on a Thursday in January, so didn't have a line at all, but it would be worth a wait. Definitely had a great experience!"
91,K144ThGmoIjX6Wh5-_Rn4Q,12/27/2022,4 star rating,"Famous for being the one restaurant in NYC where all of their waitstaff are trying their best to become unemployed there. Atmosphere: This is why people come here. It's a typical 50's style diner but it's draw is the singing staff. Each of its waitstaff are doing their best to become Broadway notables. So one minute your waiter may be grabbing you refills and the next he is belting out ""Defying Gravity"" from ""Wicked."" And all of them can sing. Makes for a lot of fun. 1 StarService: It's pretty good. It's a very popular spot with no reservations so show up early. Your waiter may change as you evening goes on as they switch in and out from singing to waiting which can lead to a few missteps, but all were very nice. 1.5 StarsFood: There was nothing that we ordered that floored us (except maybe the cheese triangles of all things) and there was also nothing that I would call disappointing. Just average fair. Everything was hot though, except the fries were more ""warmish."" 1 StarOverall: Really a once and done kind of thing for me, although I did enjoy it. It is a cool experience to see people with so much potential and talent working hard to meet their goals."

95,K144ThGmoIjX6Wh5-_Rn4Q,1/10/2023,4 star rating,"A great activity for tourists. Food is on the pricey side for diner food but you're mostly paying for the experience. Food was pretty good considering it's based on entertainment. Loved that all of the waiters are amazing entertainers and would multitask waiting and performing. Con: about 1 hour + wait based on number of the group. Groups of 2 and 3 went faster than groups of 6-7. Regardless of being in line longer than others, if your group number doesn't fit the seats they're trying to fill, then you'll be standing in line longer and longer. Overall, would recommend for the experience but be ready to stand in line for a long time as with any experience in downtown NYC."
96,K144ThGmoIjX6Wh5-_Rn4Q,12/2/2022,5 star rating,"Ellen's Stardust is an institution and a must do at least once (but probably more) in your life. It's an old, sticky diner on a corner in Midtown. The main draw here is the amazing waitstaff who are or were Broadway hopefuls.  The singing and entertaining talent is impressive and the atmosphere inside the restaurant is super lively and very fun!Don't ever be deterred by the line outside.  We came here at 12pm the day before Thanksgiving. We were a party of 9 people and waited in line for 45 min, tops. If the weather is nice, the time flies by while your taking in the sights and people watching. They were very efficient inside and out, moving everything along. To that point, you shouldn't expect a long and leisurely meal. When you're done eating, you're done! Setting the expectation is everything. The food was pretty decent too - better than I expected. I got the Reuben and it wasn't bad. My husband got the corned beef hash with eggs and it was really good, actually. It was made from scratch and not from a can. We also shared the French toast which had berries, coconut and a delicious creamy sauce. My son's chocolate chip pancakes were huge and tasty but a little tough/chewy actually. They have a bar and fun drink options! Go and enjoy!"
97,K144ThGmoIjX6Wh5-_Rn4Q,1/1/2023,4 star rating,"Our family had a BLAST at this New York diner, famous for its fabulous singing waitstaff who deliver a nonstop parade of showtunes and pop songs. Yeah, the food is nothing to write home about (although my Rueben was solid and my kids loved their Cookie Monster Shake), but the entertainment is worth every minute of the visit. Tables are crammed atop each other on both levels of the diner, but you'll appreciate the camaraderie as you and your fellow patrons are serenaded by a cast of supremely talented performers during dinner. Many of the servers have already had roles on Broadway, and all of them are auditioning for a gig on the Great White Way. At the very least, witnessing the gifted singers at the Stardust will leave with a greater appreciation for just how difficult the road to showbiz success can be -- if performers with this much talent are waiting tables, how much luck does it take to make it on Broadway?So jump in the queue on 51st St. (it moves pretty quick), slide into a table with a cocktail and some grub, and settle in for a show at The Stardust that you won't soon forget. A MUST for theater lovers visiting the Big Apple!"

Ellen's Stardust Diner sits in New York's theatre district on Broadway and boasts a faculty of aspiring talents that will serenade as you eat your on your diner munchies. A must go for any local or tourist alike, looking beyond from that of a restaurant, it's really a themed establishment that provides an experience.Taste: 4/5Service: 4/5Ambience: 6/5Value for money: 4/5Let's start with the value for money numbers, the food and drinks are definitely overpriced in relative to diners in the area, but what you are really paying for isn't just the food, but for your singing waiters and waitresses. A shake is $17 versus a place nearby that goes for $13-14, so your average mark up is probably 25% more.We had:1) holy moly French toast: An excellent sweet dish, with cream! Recommend for throes who love sweetness 2) chicken and waffle: solid but hurts to pay $27 for it, not as worth it as the toast in my humble opinionPS, they charge an automatic 20% gratuity.Given how well they sing, and the atmosphere, I'll definitely be back!"
99,K144ThGmoIjX6Wh5-_Rn4Q,4/4/2023,3 star rating,"If you're a tourist, this place is definitely worth a visit! The performers are all fantastic and the atmosphere is really cool. However, be aware that prices can be a bit steep due to the many performances they offer. Additionally, gratuity is included automatically in the final bill and the performers may also collect tips during the show, which can feel a bit awkward. Despite this, I had a great time and would recommend it to others visiting the area."

Stick with plain cheese slices for $2. Can't go wrong. I do like the spicy beef patties with cheese and pepperoni, as well. Can be akin to a Tarantino film in there late at night, but I like that."

104,XOB4qyZTf_drgGVrBpVUhw,6/25/2016,4 star rating,"There's nothing like a NY slice of pizza! Walking around the area today looking for a place to grab a bite and I came across Lenny's.   The ""$1.50 slice"" sign outside is what really brought me in.   Once I got inside I saw the sign for garlic knots 3 for $1 so I added that to my list also.  The people behind the counter were working fast to get everyone's order in.  When my slice and garlic knots were ready I handed him  card and then I was told they only accept cash.  I neverrr have cash on me so I told him I'd look for an ATM.  As I walked outside he met me from the side window with my food and told me if I didn't have the cash its OK.  I was shocked he said that but I was determined to pay for my food.  He told me there was an ATM in the back of the store and I went there and made a withdraw. I paid for my food and dined in.   I was going to give 3 stars but I bumped it up to 4 because of the great service.  He was going to let me have the food for free.    I hope in the future they begin to accept cards because a lot of business can be lost by declining customers with cards .  Great food overall!"

We have eaten at the restaurant but most of the time we order delivery. I was surprised to see people had trouble with delivery because they are one of the best we have encountered, on time and polite. When we had to call about something once the person on the phone was nice as well. The pizza is great and I have also enjoyed their pasta with meatballs. My husband love their caesar salad. We order from here at least 3 times a month and consistently have good food."
109,XOB4qyZTf_drgGVrBpVUhw,7/16/2011,3 star rating,"In any other neighborhood, I'm not sure I'd give this as high a rating, and to be honest the pizza isn't really that good - it's okay, it's better than going to the Little Ceasar's around the corner, that's for certain. It's Brooklyn, though - and to be honest - I've had better Pizza in the Maryland Suburbs. So that's a disappointment.  The real story here are the sandwiches and the chicken - It's hard to mess these things up, but if I wanted tenders I have to choose between here and Crown, Kennedy, or KFC - I pick this place every time. The cookies are $0.50 each and they par-bake them and heat them up to order. I appreciate that. The guys working the counter are nice enough, and they'll talk to you and joke around with the neighborhood guys - so that's nice to see."

When I called to get a refund, the boy talking to me handled the situation horribly. He was persistent in arguing with me about the food and hung up on me. It was ridiculous. I've worked in the restaurant business for years and when a customer had an issue with the food, we valued their opinion and took it off the bill. That's what you do. I will never order from this place again. Luckilly I was fully refunded by seamless. Now that's a respectable business."

Raised by my Chinese mother and grandmother in Hawaii, where tasty Chinese food is prevalent, I am honestly unimpressed with Chinese restaurants here in NYC. So when I first tried Zhong Hua 8 years ago for some comfort food in a cold winter, I was pleasantly surprised. Their Chinese food is wonderful on my Chinese American taste buds; and their scallion pancakes- authentically made just like the ones I have had in Taiwan and China. The place might be cheap but they def know what they are doing. I have been a loyal customer for 8 years, and will remain so for years to come!"

It was 80% cabbage with barely any chicken, some scallions and carrots, and it was watery as hell. The pancakes you're supposed to wrap them with were dry, tasteless, filo-like wraps that tore very easily. I guess it was cheap but holy crap was I surprised by the poor quality..."
114,C9ZHnwxy9E-iWAQEW0uOVQ,3/12/2017,5 star rating,Great people. The food is unbeatable for the price. Cheap eats in great location. Get the salt and pepper shrimp. Also try the homemade ice tea  and bbq spare ribs.

116,C9ZHnwxy9E-iWAQEW0uOVQ,10/4/2008,1 star rating,Certainly cheap but the quality is pretty low. It's Chinese. Cheap Chinese isn't that hard to find. I almost never throw any food away unless it goes bad and their scallion pancakes I did. So greasy and not appetizing at all.
117,C9ZHnwxy9E-iWAQEW0uOVQ,1/24/2016,1 star rating,"First off, I never write reviews but I had to leave a word of warning from anyone thinking of ordering from this place. I waited for my order for over an hour and a half and once the food finally arrived it was barely edible. The chicken in the chicken fried rice and general tsos didn't even look like chicken, more like scraps of who knows what. I tried it and it tasted chewy and outright gross. Never ever again. There's much better Chinese restaurants in the area."

I am leaving this review as hopefully a push to the owner to clean up your restaurant. Flies were literally overhead and on the table. The entire restaurant looks tired, which is acceptable, but dirty is not. I always order a spinach and feta omelette with tomatoes on the side. Everywhere. This is the only restaurant in recent memory that has used frozen spinach. Not the worst thing, but when coupled with the overall dinginess and the flies...no thanks. Will not be back."

The inside is old yet beautiful (don't expect glamor when walking in), yet that helps set the obeisance when you have great food, amazing staff that knows the history and a medium wait for your seat.. well worth it! Allow me to start. First and foremost, it's a diner where movies and TV shows are often filmed. If you're a celebrity junkie, Brad Pitt and a few others have sat, acted and ate here. Stephanie our waitress was funny and joked alongside with us. Ask for her when you're considering this place. She was on point with our orders and never missed a beat with our coffee refills. I cannot talk too much about the food because I was stuffing my face and forgot to take a photo, yet the plate for all four of us was cleaned, and their serving size was more than generous.To end this review, this is my new go-to diner."
127,W0c-FS060axwxHcCtJwuRw,11/13/2021,1 star rating,Disgusting burger and fries tasted like they were cooked in week old dirty oil. They actually wanted to pick up the food that I complained about.  Makes me wonder.

I sat at the counter and took in all of the nostalgia: old menus, green counter tops, and some signed portraits. After a free cup of OJ was served I ordered the bcaon omelette with a bagel. The portions are big and filling and the plane bagel was great with butter. Things may not be farm to table but everything tastes freshly made."

It's your classic diner; pancakes, bacon, coffee & eggs. I came here for a Friday brunch and ordered the blueberry pancakes with banana and whipped cream on top. My partner in crime ordered the strawberry pancakes. We were both extremely satisfied.Service was good too! We ordered a lot but it came fairly quickly. To anyone in the neighborhood, I highly recommend Broadway Restaurant. It's a great diner on the UWS that definitely deserved moreProps."

It's totally renovated from the 80s when it was new n lots of mirrors but it's still the same in many ways. New owners/ managers are nice but it will always belong to Gus, he ran it like a tight ship n may he RIP. He made that diner n hopefully it will be around a long time"

The menu is extensive and the service is quick. I haven't had any trouble getting a table right away even during their busier weekend hours. You're not coming here for a gourmet meal, but the food is adequate and like any diner, you have to feel out what is good and what isn't. The omelette platters are standard. The burgers are good with a smokey burger king-esque taste to them. Good crisp fries. Hot Reuben sandwich, yes. Tuna melt, no."
132,ObjazJwm92h-gBq5nJUz0w,10/10/2022,1 star rating,"The service was slow and inaccurate.  I never received my food with everyone else so I told them to just wrap it to go.  I never received my starter or the refill on my beverage that I requested.  When I did finally eat my meal at home, it was average at best.  There are some excellent diners out there, unfortunately, this is definitely not one of them....go try one of the good ones."

Today we ordered a grilled cheese, two soups and two salads. $58.00 before tip and we came to pick it up. My salad. A Cobb salad looked great. Fresh chicken, bacon and egg that wasn't gray. The lettuce however was rotten. To the point it was mush and inedible, probably downright unsafe to consume. I called the diner and had the salad brought back to be replaced with another. I specifically told them to please check the batch of lettuce and if it's no good let me know and I'd switch my order to something else. I get the second salad. Again it looks good, I turn over the salad leaves and sure enough. Just as rotten. This time I didn't send it back because honestly, who wants spit in their food?This is simply a danger and an easy way to contract food poisoning or in best case scenario bad diarrhea. A quick quality control check when a customer calls you to inform you of an issue would have easily solved a second bad batch of salad but I guess cutting corners is the way to go. This will be the absolute last time I eat at this establishment. It's a shame really."
134,ObjazJwm92h-gBq5nJUz0w,8/2/2022,1 star rating,Let me tell you what I went through tonight w this diner and you tell me if you want to deal with THEM ! They were closed for weeks and weeks and recently re-opened to new owners . Its 8/2/22 and its 837PM and I call up to ask when do you close and girl says 10pm so I say so if I am there by 930pm we can eat / be served and she repeats we closet at 10 OKEY DOKE so I drive over and get there at 915PM and all the lights are off around the outside and it looks run down / closed BUT I see people inside so I go to enter and the doors are ALL locked shut - yet the sign on all doors read OPEN 7AM - 10PM ! So I call 4 x and this old man finally answers and I tell him doors are locked and I am outside and just called !!!!!! and was told you CLOSE AT TEN !  He comes to door at 915PM and says we closed and I am irate and after 5 minutes of yelling HOW CAN YOU CLOSE AT 915 PM  it says 10PM - he says we want everyone out by 10  SO I say then make the sign say we close at 9 !!!! After a major back and forth battle he says let me ask my kitchen and he comes back and opens the door - he says to me you have to be done eating and OUT by 10 no matter what even if you are not done eating - he made me promise we'd be fast - WE sat and there were 6 other booths/ tables eating that were in before us - so we order fast - we eat fast and guess what its 950PM and all the Other 6 tables were STILL IN THERE EATING as we beat them ALL so why did you break my chops !!!  and torture me JUST HORRIBLE way to treat customers and do business !!!!

We all arrived within 10 minutes of each other.The first one to arrive saw lots of empty tables, so she asked the host if it would be OK to wait for her friends at a an empty table, and was told 'Yes.'The waitress came quickly to take her order, but she explained to the waitress that she preferred not to order until her friends arrived. I was the last one to arrive. I didn't even have a chance to open the menu, when the waitress wanted me to give her my order. I explained I needed a few minutes to look at the menu. She returned one minute later, demanding my order. When I said I needed a bit more time, she said her shift was over and I would have to give my order to the next waitress. She had a major chip on her shoulder!     The next waitress took our orders. I had a large salad plate, which was OK. Both my friends ordered pastrami on rye. The pastrami sandwiches came without anything on the side - no pickles, no coleslaw, no potato salad. The busboy delivered our drinks, and we asked him about the pickles, etc. He promised to tell the waitress. But nobody returned with pickles, etc. We kept looking for the waitress, but she didn't come around until it was time to ask if we wanted desert. When we finally had a chance to tell her about the pickle issue, she said we should have asked her!I really hope they train their wait staff better in the future. Bridgeview is conveniently located for us and it has a parking lot."

They have family photos behind the counter when you walk in, the staff wears uniforms (shirt/tie/vest), and there's a private parking lot out back so you never need to look for parking!In traditional diner fashion, the menu is expansive and has just about everything under the sun. The food is ok; my go-to for diners is always the cheeseburger deluxe and the burgers at this place were just about what you would expect. The price is extremely reasonable and makes up for any of the food's shortcomings.  There's just something about it that's just really pleasant. Sometimes it's nice going to a restaurant and getting the same experience that you would get 25 years ago. I will continue to support these places and come here whenever I have the chance and I hope you do too!"

I don't know why she asked us to follow her to sit in a place that was not clean and when I asked to be placed in another table she tell us to step out of the place to the lobby we wait out there .The gentleman saw us and remind her that we was waiting so then she asked us to follow her. The food was horrible first of all they don't serve the French toast as usually serve in other dinners it was just white bread soak on eggs than frayed the manager once asked us if we need help.I responded someone is helping. I appreciate, the guys who bring the food and the coffee guy were  nice, what's bothering me is this woman who receive us ,I thing she should be more courteous and nice."

I usually come for breakfast sandwiches which are usually AMAZING but recently started trying their hot food. Omg it's so delicious. There's also a buffet area that has items like lomein, bbq chicken, rice, etc. plus they updated their chips selection which includes the fancy brands popping up these days including kettle chips and others. Of course they sell hot bagels as well, which is made on the premises. The last thing I ordered was a cheese omelet meal which came w home fries and buttered toast for $7. It didn't disappoint.

I feel bad for all of the workers from delivery staff to chefs and counter people its huge space so it will be interesting to see who occupies the space.there are3 other chirping chickens in manhattan I'll have to visit just for all times sake.i apologize for any errors in my review  but I literally can't see what I'm  trying only a message from yelp telling  me to mention food service  ambiance...sorry yelp not helpful.
153,L65-2QsNv3y7-tu6xGLAUA,12/27/2019,4 star rating,"I went to Chirping Chicken for lunch and got the Chicken Shawarma Sandwich. It was basically a gyro, with chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and tzatziki sauce inside. The chicken (which is this restaurant's specialty) was slightly above average- tender but also a bit burned. For $9, this was a decent deal.The lady at the cashier was super friendly and the service speed was pretty good. There is adequate seating inside this restaurant, though it seemed like a lot of the customers were getting their food to go.Overall, Chirping Chicken is a solid choice for an affordable lunch. I would especially recommend it if you are a big fan of chicken, as this restaurant has many different variations of chicken dishes."

My family absolutely loved the food! I quote my father ""I haven't had chicken this good in a while, very juicy-tender & seasoned just right!"" So glad he enjoyed the food as my father is a very picky eater.  He was looking at the menu for a good 5 minutes after eating. Will definitely be back!"
156,L65-2QsNv3y7-tu6xGLAUA,9/21/2018,3 star rating,"I honestly did not find my rice and beans with 2 piece (drumstick and breast) to be quite appetizing. The overall dish was alright and there was nothing really special about it, nor does it really stand out from your typical chicken dish. The flavoring/seasoning on the chicken could've been stronger and the beans tasted as if they just opened a can of beans and poured it over the rice. I haven't tried their other menu items here yet, but I'll be sure to give it a shot the next time I decide to return (if I decide to return). Overall, I'd say take your chances with this place if you're contemplating giving this place a try. The venue was relatively empty when I stopped by at about 5:30 in the evening and people were just loitering here (deliverymen and customers). Even in the Times Square/Theater District neighborhood, you can tell a good chicken place by the amount of people dining there and the aroma of spices that engulfs the whole block and Chirping Chicken does not meet those requirements. The staff working here were pretty friendly, so I'll give them that."

One of our family member's cats loves human food and he literally cried for the chicken cutlet. He loved it so much. I've seen this cat turn away from Peruvian chicken! I'm not a fan of their rotisserie chicken. I just don't care for it. The pita bread is pretty good when fresh. The potato salad.. cole slaw reminds me of food I had in high school or I guess a typical deli. The fries are almost like McDonald's but not as salty. I actually liked the chicken nuggets. It's much better than your typical fast food chicken nuggets... It looks like white meat, but at $7 for a small... I expected way more. It's like a snack for a lil kid!This place is pretty packed in the evening."

I can't believe they call that a large.We also ordered the carrot cake and what was given to us was half a slice... the whole bottom of the carrot cake was missing... like they didn't bother grabbing the whole slice correctly to place on the plate, so I asked for a different slice (if I'm paying $5 for a slice, it better be a real slice, not some halved barely there slice). I can tell they got annoyed but I was also annoyed receiving that measly slice. Carrot cake was really good, but the way it was served wasn't."

I probably wouldn't get that again.When I paid, I forgot to scan my app for credit for the meal and the receipt did not have a barcode for me to scan after the fact (usually there's a barcode).

First off if you are not a New Yorker, then you will see differences as far as the atmosphere and people,but its not a bad thing at all. But the two waiters I had, gold! No issues they were on it and the new associate I met and spoke to for about an hour both agreed that this is a great location.Unlike me they are a daily regular there.I would too if I lived close . I have been to other locations here in the district ( F street,) and they were far from nice( except the union station one) , and the establishment was bigger and less congested. I ordered my soup, coffee and toast, ordered some stuff to go and had a great conversation. They did not rush me they just kept making sure that I was fine. Its a great place for coffee and yummy avocado toast! I cant wait to go back when I visit home. I always stop in when I am coming from the Japanese Book store( I made an updated review on) I am thankful for the atmosphere, and the chargers at the middle of the tables when come in and make a left. They were life saver considering both phones died! I have no idea why they say the service is slow , they had everything out to me so quick and boxed the stuff I didnt eat. Like I said before, its my go to place when I am in the area. Great quick coffee date, business meet or hangout spot."

Now I love supporting small businesses, but when you start to rob your customers that is a whole 'nother issue. We ordered takeout from here some months ago and we were disappointed with what we got. I ordered from here tonight and we feel totally scammed like the first time. Living in south Brooklyn, we don't have authentic Indian food locally. We ordered from Ashoka Grill and while the food is tasty, the charges for what you get does not match. We ordered lamb vindaloo and chicken masala and what we received was 4-5 lamb cubes in a sauce with a ton of potatoes and  dried out chicken breast cubes in a tikki masala sauce for a whopping 50 bucks!!!!!! Never again, please avoid... The fact that we spent an upcharge for Uber Eats made this more insulting, My advice, show up in person and tell them what you expect for dinner!"

The vibe of this place, at night, is packed and dark and very loud. I didn't mind the vibe but where we were sat, it was extremely close to the other table. I understand it's New York and space is hard to come by but it was just a weirdly close space as opposed to other places to sit in this restaurant. All of the workers were really nice and accommodating. Our used plates were always cleared from the table and several people came to check on the table. The food also came out in a nice amount of time, we didn't wait long at all. My favorite part of the meal was the bread. It was cooked perfectly and the sheep's milk cheese was silky and tasty. I ended up getting the rigatoni dish which was very tasty but way too rich. It actually made my stomach upset because of how rich it was. The unfortunate part of the meal was my friend's dish where she requested no peas and it was literally packed with peas so it made the dish even smaller of a portion because she had to eat around the peas. I wish the waiter would have recommended something else after she asked for no peas or told her it was a small dish. This is not a place id revisit even though I really wanted to like it so bad."

Whatever the tomato sauce situation was was delicious. 3. Mezzi rigatoni. A huge portion and so much flavor! Another great winter dish. 4. Uova medonese which also had such powerful flavors. And of course, 5. Lemon ricotta pancakes for the table. How could we not! They were as amazing as they looked. Everything was 5/5! Also got a side of bacon. We did ask if it was thick and they said no and that was not true, but it was delicious nonetheless. Last of all, the beet juice (Roots #3) was SO good. Heavy on the ginger but I felt so healthy."
198,pk89jzL1RsE9U0thf_z6tw,4/1/2022,5 star rating,"I was pleasantly surprised with a birthday dinner at Locanda Verde, and I was thrilled to be back there after so many years.  The dining room was completely packed and buzzing with patrons, even on a Sunday evening.  Our small table was positioned near the window, along the side of the restaurant, which gave us a view of the majority of the space, including the bar and open kitchen.I started with a glass of 2020 I Clivi Friulano ""San Pietro"" from Fruili, which was crisp and delightful.  When it came to the food, the gifters of that generous meal had selected the restaurant because of their special ""Celebration of Black Truffles from Umbria"" menu, though we wound up only ordering dessert off it, which I will get to later.  In the meantime, we decided to share a bunch of courses from their regular menu.We started with the Lamb Meatball Sliders, which were topped with caprino Italian cheese and pickled cucumbers.  The little burgers certainly were an odd mix of flavors that worked really well together.  They might have looked like traditional beef meatballs, but a bite revealed the gamey flavor of lamb, which was a bit of a mind tease.From there, we moved onto some pastas, where we opted for the Spaghetti and the Mezzi Rigatoni.  The spaghetti had a creamy, fishy sauce and contained peekytoe crab and bottarga di muggine (grey mullet roe).  Calabrian chiles added a subtle kick to the dish.  The rigatoni, on the other hand, possessed a more robust, earthy flavor with its lamb bolognese sauce, which was topped with a scoop of sheep's milk ricotta and a sprig of mint.For entrees, we selected the Roasted Duck, which was served with baby turnips and farro.  A pomegranate jus had been drizzled over the ingredients, making it a comforting and seasonal winter dish.  The Olive Oil Poached Halibut, on the other hand, was delicate and provided a slight relief from the heaviness of the rest of our meal.  The beautifully cooked fish was served in a broth infused with fennel, capers, and lemon.  While both of these main courses had some accouterments, we were still enticed to order a side of the Brussel Sprouts, which had been caramelized, along with pancetta, in an apple mostarda.  They were heavenly! Before the dessert arrived, I joined my companions in transitioning to a mocktail, one of which blended grapefruit and ginger beer and the other combined cucumber and lime, but both were extremely refreshing.  For dessert, the warm pear tart was elegantly composed from a poached pear surrounded by a flaky pastry crust.  It was served over an Italian cream and surrounded by pomegranate seeds and crushed almond amaretti.  Lastly, the Warm Dark Chocolate ""Lava"" Cake from the truffle menu did not disappoint.  The warm chocolate brownie was decadently topped with fresh hazelnuts, a scoop of black truffle gelato, and black truffle shavings; it was sinfully delicious!It was fantastic to see that Locanda Verde was still drawing a substantial crowd so many years after its opening, but it surely earned that distinction with its stellar food."

I dropped off a cake to surprise her with before our 5:45pm reservation and they usually have a fee of $6 per guest but they waived it for us. They provided a complimentary candle and brought it out as a surprise after our entrees. Appetizers: highly highly recommend the sheep's milk ricotta and steak tartare! Both were generous portions. The ricotta was a creamy almost greek yogurt like texture. The steak tartare had the perfect balance of truffle and was topped with a small sunny side egg and crispy bacon. Entrees: I ordered the bucatini which was a good portion as well. The guanciale, which is an Italian cured meat made from pork jowl or cheeks, provided the perfect meaty balance in the red sauce. My friend ordered the cacio e pepe which she enjoyed but I thought was a bit watery. Both our pastas were cooked to al dente perfection though!The service was great - our waitress was so friendly and the sommelier was knowledgeable and accommodating to our budget/preference.

We went for brunch this weekend, and I had reasonably high hopes since I'd been for dinner a couple years ago. Overall decor was nice, not too loud or busy in the AM and an aesthetic restaurant.The pastry basket was pretty good (+1 to croissants) albeit a tad overpriced at $27 for 5 pieces, only 4 of which were good.The brunch entrees were passable at best: pancakes, waffles and mezzi rigatoni all got fairly mediocre reviews from our group, considering they were pricey ($34 for the rigatoni) as well. That being said, can't fault portion size - could only finish half of my pancakes so at $24 perhaps pretty great value.Service was great, the staff was very attentive and kind.However, and here is where the review gets spicy - the food quality in the end was a bit of a disaster. Two of us (myself, ordered pancakes + friend, ordered scramble) got bad food poisoning a few hours later, without eating any food in between. I honestly didn't expect my first experience with food poisoning in NYC to come here given the lack of care I put towards what I eat, but this was a brutally painful evening and morning after.All in all - their dinner from what I vaguely remember was fairly good? Brunch not so much. Take your chances, and certainly do not order the pancakes. (Maybe that's on me for ordering lemon pancakes at an Italian restaurant)."

I found the service to be slow and the food was lacking for the price. If I am dropping over $200 on brunch for a family of four, it had better be worth it. I had the Porchetta sandwich, which was underwhelming. The only standout dish was the roasted chicken that my son had. Everything else was, meh."

Reservations are highly recommended for weekend brunch, as they fill up quickly. From what it sounded like though, walk ins didn't take too long, but I'd err on the side of caution and say make the reservation!The restaurant has a lively ambiance, but seating arrangements still allow for private conversations. I ordered the green shakshuka & my friend ordered the chicken kebab. The shakshuka was really tasty and not heavy - I really enjoyed this for a light breakfast! I only wish there were more pieces of bread. The chicken kebab seemed to have really good flavor as well. Prices are to be expected for the city, and service was excellent."
230,Zabkjf2HIT-ZAPmgMF3Lvw,3/10/2023,3 star rating,"I've heard a lot of hype about this place, but I don't think it's anything special. It's just another breakfast place in my opinion. Considering the food was nothing out of the ordinary and didn't have anything special about the taste, I don't think it was quite worth the money. If you want to go to a brunch place that looks trendy/nice, then is place is fine, but if you want legitimately good food, maybe go elsewhere."
231,Zabkjf2HIT-ZAPmgMF3Lvw,11/20/2022,4 star rating,"We went for brunch and ordered drinks to start. The cantaloupe mimosa was refreshing and light. I almost wanted a little more cantaloupe to highlight the flavors a bit more. The peri peri wings were wonderfully flavored. They were packed with spice, cooked well. My only critique here would be that I would have preferred for the skin to be crispy. The maya bowl was wonderful. Everything in the bowl was fresh, portioned appropriately. My poached egg was cooked to perfection and the avocado was bright and green. Their green sauce adds more intensity to the flavors. When you combine a bit of each item in the bowl you can build the perfect bite. My only criticism here would be that the liquid pools a little at the bottom of the bowl, probably from the squash spaghetti. Maybe if they plate it differently or put some grains on the bottom it would soak that up. Despite the wait, I would come back. The service was friendly and knowledgeable. There was a bit of wait to get fresh black pepper , hot sauce and no check on how are food arrived or we were missing anything but they were very busy and understandably so. The place is small, unpretentious and clean . A quaint place to gather for a casual brunch with fun eclectic music."
232,Zabkjf2HIT-ZAPmgMF3Lvw,11/23/2022,4 star rating,"After hearing about this spot for a bit, my husband and I checked it out on an early Sunday morning around 9:20 am. We got there just in time because about 10 minutes later a waitlist had started. Aesthetically, this restaurant is lovely with bright decor and fun music playing, while we enjoyed our meals. We ordered the Mediterranean breakfast, poached eggs with roasted tomato and halloumi, zucchini chips, a matcha, and a latte. Matcha - My husband absolutely loved the flavor and said it wasn't too sweet like some cafes make it.Latte - Was delicious. The coffee was bold without being bitter.Zucchini chips - These were your standard zucchini chips nothing too special. Though the sauce it came with was very flavorful. But, I'd probably skip on these next time.Mediterranean breakfast - This included: a salad, pita bread, labne, avocado, and two eggs. The green sauce it came with was delicious and really added a kick to the dish, which would have been bland without it. Overall, a light, refreshing breakfast. Poached eggs with roasted tomato and halloumi: Absolutely delicious! The pairing of the roasted heirloom tomato with the grilled halloumi and poached eggs. OMG. Went so, so well together. The sourdough bread given to dip in the egg yolk was a nice touch. Overall, we really enjoyed our experience. Everything we ordered was delicious. But, some things to keep in mind: - This place gets packed very quickly. The seating is very close together, and despite the waitstaff being super nice everything can feel a bit rushed because of the demand. We didn't feel comfortable sitting around for too long. - The portions are small, especially for the price. If you want more than a little bite, be ready to spend more than some other places."
233,Zabkjf2HIT-ZAPmgMF3Lvw,3/13/2023,3 star rating,"Jack's Wife Freda was a natural spot for my bucket list when I moved to the city! Came here for brunch with my girlfriends, and luckily we were able to secure a spot without too much wait. That being said, considering it was a busy day, the service was a bit subpar. Considering we were seated outside, that might explain why it took us so long to get our food. We ended up splitting the shakshuka, which was a little disappointing considering the price point. It didn't pack the punch I normally expect from the dish, but our table did enjoy the sauce that came with the zucchini chips. Overall, I think it's good to go once, but I don't plan on coming back."

Upon arriving I saw a long line but assumed it would be different for those of us who came with reservations but it was not. Even after having had reservations my friend and I were told that we would either have to eat at their outdoor dining area or wait to be seated inside and that the wait time could be between 15-20 mins or longer as their is a waitlist. My friend and I were born hungry and decided to sit in their heated outdoor dining area. The heated outdoor area was not ideal as the heaters didn't do much for us and we were both freezing and our food also just became cold and hard cause of how cold it was... I ordered the schnitzel and my friend ordered the Peri peri chicken. My schnitzel was delicious and I really enjoyed it. My friend said her chicken dish was seasoned well but dry. So she didn't enjoy it as much as she wanted to. Overall, the service by our sever was great. He was friendly and attentive but the overall experience felt a bit underwhelming."

The line was a bit on the longer side due to peak hours, but our waiter was super nice and gave us a free Nana tea because of the wait!I got a Rosewater Waffle, which didn't taste bad but not worth $16 imo due to the portion size. The drinks were pretty decent; I don't remember the exact drink I got but it was a bit on the sugary side. I thought JWF was pretty average out of the brunch places I've been to; for the price point I don't think I really got my money's worth.

I have my Yelp gal pal Sara saying they're expected hotel guests to arrive by Uber. Uber this! Long Island City is a strange bird to me, it's not a place where you can stroll the streets amongst the many warehouses.I was able to find street parking not too far from the hotel. Once inside, I'm feeling the chic vibe. I see my buddies in the lobby, back slaps happen and we take the elevator to the roof top.The roof top has a commanding view of the city. Spectacular. The wedding was completed and now we had a cocktail hour. The bartender made some nice drinks, they dropped a few BOPs (Brick oven pizza) on the table as I talked to the various guests. Then, we all jammed into the two elevators to the floor below where the wedding party was starting. The bride and groom kept it simple, buffet style. Carved meat, salmon and roasted vegetables. Very considerate to folks with different dietary needs. The bar was outside on the patio. I thought they had Patron but it was Don Julio. I had the bartender line up shots and we had a party in the sky.If you have a *small* party, The Boro Hotel was a nice place to have an affair. The rooftop alone is worth the price of admission, weather considering."

241,dS2dWAIU7p9rKdAgOvzVkQ,2/16/2023,1 star rating,This hotel is extremely unprofessional and likes to scam people out of their money. I stayed in the Boro Hotel back in December from the 6-9th and payed a security deposit that was supposed to be returned days after I checked out. I check out on the 9th and was told I would receive my deposit back in 2-3 days and I said okay. The next week I still hadn't received anything back so I made a claim with my bank. They refunded my money that same day and I was content that the situation was done and over with. Until recently I checked my bank statement and I see a $ 404 claim reversal from the boro hotel. I contact my bank and they tell me that I must contact the merchant to resolve the issue and when I call the hotel to talk to a manager or someone to help me they left me on hold with no one on the line for over 20 minutes. They haven't reached back to me or even acknowledged what they did to me. Please don't come here they are just trying to get your money. I am upset to even have to be dealing with this mess months after this trip occurred.

I booked it on hotel.com and when arrived it was almost $90 more than the online reservation which was annoying to say the least. Its about a three block walk from the subway station which isnt bad for getting in and out of the city. Check in went quickly and we were off to our room. We were only on the second floor so it wasnt an amazing view but a nice view of the city none the less. The attached restaurant was nice and a great place to have a quick drink and snacks after a long day of travel to NYC. The room.. well the room was very bare bones.. the floors were beautiful and the bathroom was HUGE with the biggest walk in shower ive ever used with amazing water pressure. The bed was super comfortable and I slept so well the few nights we stayed. The windows were HUGE which allowed for so much natural light and if anyone knows anything about it me its how much i love sunlight. Otherwise it was just a room, nothing fancy about it. It actually had weird paneling on the wall with the TV that didnt seem to fit into anything else."

247,dS2dWAIU7p9rKdAgOvzVkQ,7/13/2021,3 star rating,"This hotel has a great restaurant. I do highly recommend. Unfortunately, we were misled about the parking situation, which resulted in us getting a $65 parking ticket. I'm writing this review so future guests can avoid this happening to them. We were told by Miriam, who checked us in, that it was no problem to park on the street overnight. So that's what we did. I hung my handicap placard up just to be on the safe side. Sure enough, we found a ticket on our windshield the following morning. As it turns out, they did street sweeping that particular morning. Obviously, we had no idea, and found out the hard way. I called the hotel earlier today, and attempted to ask them to give their guests a heads up about the street sweeping on Friday mornings. It was actually Miriam who answered the phone. She immediately turned defensive when I mentioned that it was actually her who told us it was ok to park there. She said she always tells guests about the parking (she did not), to be sure not to park near a hydrant, because they would tow the car. She said she got a ticket herself last week. There was no professionalism involved in the conversation. She definitely did not plan on owning the fact that she neglected to mention the street sweeping to us. I finally had to hang up on her, because she was becoming more aggressive and defensive, completely missing the point of the phone call. There didn't seem to be any managers on the property to talk to about it, unfortunately. So if you are planning a stay at this hotel, keep in mind that street sweeping is every Friday, from 8:30 to 10:00 a.m."

My friend and I sat in a local park and devoured the pie. It was incredible! Perfect texture and the vegan ranch was insanely good. The cashier was pretty rugged but it fit the vibe.

She said she heard of vegan pizza spot in Brooklyn. Went to yelp typed in vegan pizza and Screamers pop upped. We got a Sicilian pie and a regular pie. It came up to over $50. I was skeptical at first because of the price but it was worth every penny. The Sicilian pizza was thick and ""cheesy"" with zesty tomato sauce dripping off of it. Both pies were amazingly delicious."
262,ZQJar03Q1n0oWgGA3ip3nw,7/29/2021,5 star rating,"I love New York-style pizza, slices hot out of the oven and loaded with cheese, but my lactose intolerance makes it hard to enjoy these days. The solution? Screamer's. All their pizza is vegan, the slices are delicious, and when I'm eating them, I don't even miss the (dairy) cheese. They usually have a bunch of different slices available to choose from, or you can order whole pies.On our last visit, we got the (seitan) pepperoni, which was great, and the Screamer slice, with garlic oil, vegan cheese, cremini and oyster mushrooms, and almond parmesan, which was amazing. If we lived close enough to do regular delivery or takeout, I think we would probably be ordering that Screamer pie all the time."

It is a tiny indoor space, but it you wanted to stand and eat your slice at the stand up counter you are welcomed to do so. I opted to just take it to the park up the block, and enjoy it via open air. Go check out Screamers, if you want a quality vegan slice at a reasonable price. The staff is very chill too & will answer any questions you have."

There is something so homey and sweet about this location and the workers seemed generally nicer here than there. It was such a great experience and really amazing food. My sister and I had gotten a couple cheesy slices, ate those then got a vegan sundae at van leeuwen then went back to screamers for more pizza :O lol!! The pizza is VERY thin but that isn't a bad thing .. possibly New York style?! Idk I'm from Jersey.. don't hurt me :P. My favorite part about it all .. is unlimited nooch........ vegans rejoice. woohooooo!!!! Definitely check out screamers for decadent pizza.. don't be wasting your time on cows milk pizza."

I visited Massachusetts and had some BOMB pizza up there, and I am afraid of not finding anything to the same expectations. I like my pizza, somewhat thick(not so much bread-wise, but Cheese, Sauce, and Ingredients). So far, here in NY, no luck on that, but I went here and tried their ""Screamer"" Pizza, and the Size of that slice scared tf out of me. That slice was Paper Thin... But*** the flavor of it made me happy. Didn't look filling to me at first glance but the flavor was awesome, but heads up- if you are not an oyster fan, the texture of the mushroom might be iffy to some! Other than that, I'd have to try more to actually Recommend this place. If anyone sees this and has any recommendations to try... please let me know! Thanks."

Warm and fresh out of the oven he handed me a large chocolate chip cookie and smiled. He said that was because it was my first time there. It made such an impression on me that I will return and I highly reccommend everyone explore it. They have food and desserts as well.The cappuccino and cookie were as good as I expected them to be.

The turkey was lightly cooked and complemented with the right amount of cheese. Overall, the crepe was soft, delicious, and left me very well satisfied. The other crepes were also very delicious. I recommend this place if you're looking for a good breakfast."

I've frequented this unique cafe for several years; sometimes it is the main reason I make a trip up to New York from Washington, DC. Its croissants are the best I've had in my life and they surpass those I've had in Europe and other culinary capitals. Everything else on the menu, of course, is also delicious (I often eat their savory and sweet crepes). During the pandemic, HBC has maintained its high-quality cuisine and beverages."

I got the chicken thigh sandwich with goat cheese and roasted red peppers, and a croissant. I had high hopes for the sandwich but it really wasn't that great, it reminded me of the kind of sandwiches you get in corporate offices during catered lunch meetings  . The croissant however was a winner! Pillowy soft and buttery, and I could tell they warmed it up it for me. I'd definitely go back for that!"

I must say Harlem Blues Cafe was a perfect find. I walked in a on rainy day and met up with a close friend visiting the city. She instantly fell in love as I did. I ordered the Salmon salad with the mint lemonade and wow was I surprised. The salad was tasteful and my drink was refreshing ( I almost ordered another one!).

We got takeout via their website.Mixed Grill - chicken, lamb, and sausage + 2 sidesA great way to get a taste of everything! Surprisingly the chicken was the best of the lot. The lamb was a bit stringy and the sausage a bit dry. There also wasn't an option to pick 2 sides when we ordered online (not sure if that's a bug), I just got 2 scoops of the cucumbery-tomato salad. Otherwise would highly recommend going through their own website for ordering.Appetizer mazza - this was great. Hummus, baba ghanoush, a hefty scoop of the spiced tomato, salad, with falafel on top and generous drizzle of tahini.Falafel sandwich - we were actually so full from the appetizer we didn't get around to this until the next day, and it was still delicious.Will definitely be coming back!"

The Tomate was a skimpy piece of toasted bread loaded with slivers of raw tasteless tomatoes.  We also had the Champignons.. one piece if skimpy toast with mushrooms and cold tiny chunks cheese. It all  had an awful moldy tatse.  I am hoping this was just an off day since I really like the place.  I was expecting it to be similar to the wine bar Le Pif that was on Broadway between 70th and 71st.  The food there was excellent.If anyone who works in the kitchen reads this.. please make improvements!!!  .

EVERY time glasses were emptied we just waited. it was clear he was never going to refill them (unless asked - service 101 shit).The last time i thought, i have a new glass of wine, let me go to the bathroom and see if my empty water is refilled by the time I'm back. Laughable3) Now I'm just being petty lol the goat cheese crostini (chevre chaud au four) - delicious but this was actually a cheese dip with bread & crostini on the side4) Deviled eggs were great5) mac and cheese was maybe cheeselesss? not even at the level of olive garden or kraft, much less a nice wine bar6) we were done with our plate of olives.

They have a smorgasbord of snack foods for all appetites. They sell beef and veggie burgers - single or double - in a bed or onions- with or without cheese - on a melt in your mouth heated soft bun, fish sandwiches and clam strips, chicken sandwiches, chicken rings and mozzarella sticks. The traditional French fries, drinks and milk shakes and dessert. Their cheesecake on a stick is delicious and addictive. Their milk shakes are so thick that they kinda dry your throat out. You have to order a drink to wash the milk shake down. It is suggested that you sample a few menu item. Unless you are a bourgeois, fork and knife, restaurant table with waiter/waitress type, I think you will like some of the food."

Although I wish the drive thru was a little faster. Overall no disappointments.

There just weren't enough redeeming qualities to round up to 3.The food itself is usually pretty good. It definitely fills that craving and White Castle is one-of-a-kind when it comes to those little burgers. Beware though... They are open 24 hours a day so it can get addicting!As far as customer service goes, there really isn't much. Almost every time I have ordered from inside, the staff is just chatting and mingling amongst themselves rather than servicing guests. The last time I was there, I waited almost 30 minutes because somebody forgot to fry off some mozzarella sticks. There was no apology or anything and it seems like management is non-existent unless you ask for them.And the drive-thru? Fuggetaboutit. On average, I probably sat in White Castle's drive-thru for 25 minutes. You're better off going inside.Also... I once ordered online (terrible app, btw. not user-friendly at all) and figured going through the drive-thru to pick-up would have been quicker (since it was an option in the app) and I was still told I had to come inside anyway. What a waste."

I remember when they had the chicken rings in hot sauce seasoning and the hidden valley ranch flavor too. The service here is actually better than all the other ones in Queens. The one on Queens Blvd is slow whereas this one is quick, somewhat friendly (they do act mechanical at times) but I've never had an issue with receiving the wrong order or anything being missing. They do their job well.Favorite thing to get is the bacon double cheese sliders, with onion rings, extra ketchup and tarter sauce and a chocolate milkshake."

They do have some American options on the menu like steak and fries but I've found that they overcook the meat so best to go with straight Mexican food.VERY cheap. You can get a meal for less than $10 and be stuffed. Also quality of ingredients (for the Mexican food) is pretty good. They also have an old juke box with old Spanish music which my grandmother loved when I took her.

Apparently they also have a great vegetarian burrito with avocado, rice and beans. The vegetarian I know swears by them. But beware the burritos are huge but cheap $5.25 each. Decor is very mexican with the typical mexican fabric as curtains and a juke box that plays mariachi music :p Small tables. Come for excellent, cheap, authentic mexican food! Highly recommended!"

The food was amazing and will get to that soon. First and foremost try to make reservations so you are not left to be standing in the cold. We tried to make reservations but nobody picks up the phone and it's a recording. Ok so we could have made it online but if you do not have access one would think the phone option should not make be an issue. Anyway the guy handling the front door is amazing and was super nice. He set us up at the bar al we would not have to stand in the rain so super kudos to him. But after getting to the bar, it seems like the bartender had an issue and began reprimanding the front door guy. So there is no hostess at the front so this poor guy is doing two jobs...like over and beyond type work and getting reprimanded at the same time. Well thankgoodness our time at the bar was short lived because a seat opened up for us and we were whisked away from the confusion!Now I can start talking about how delicious the meal was! We did not do a boil as planned because we were not super hungry and decided to do a little bit of everything from the shared meals. We were not disappointed at all. Each dish was seasoned to perfection and tasted so good. I would definitely go back knowing what to expect on the front end. Once you get past that everything goes uphill from there and you will enjoy the experience."

The biggest reason I do not recommend because they told me the fish was okay to eat at room temp and anyone who has ever eaten sushi before knows that that is the best was to end up with food poisoning. Makes you think that they don't know the proper handling of raw fish."

I order my food to go and sit to watch the ladies picking snow peas with their hands as they walk back and forth answering the phone and tending to customers, no gloves no wiping of their hands. A few customers walk in after me each were greeted with a smile hello and so forth. So I get my food and the woman handed it to me and we locked eyes. A stand off who would use their manners first. Welp neither of use did. I get home to open my the chicken fried rice and we'll no chicken we let's not say no chicken how about 1 chicken strip cut up. All 3 of my chicken friend Rice's were the same. The amount was so small it's insulting. Not to mention the seaweed on my sushi is less than fresh like chewing elastic."

I'd give it 5 stars but the staff was awkward. Had to ask for something to drink. And the staff took turns eating taking up tables and had poor table manners. Just weird people but food was good

We looked over the menu and one of the waitresses came over to take our order, I said we needed a minute. Three minutes later the other waitress came over to take our order, and again I said we needed a few minutes. When we were ready to order I got the snow mountain roll and a miso soup. My friend ordered a Kani salad, a shrimp tempura and a few other rolls. The food came quickly and was delicious. Immediately after I finished the waitress rushed over to take my plate, even though my friend was still eating. After my friend finished she quickly took his plate and gave us the check. Kind of like they wanted us to leave. Overall I will come back for the food, maybe order pick up."

THE WHEELS ON THE BUS GO ROUND AND ROUND, ROUND AND ROUND, etc... Staff should consider asking the family if they can use headphones or to at least turn down the volume for the sake of other patrons. We noticed other tables also in complete awe of the lack of respect. We didn't finish our meals- got the check and left."

We added the pork roll for an additional $6 and very yummy. Will be back!

They had great service and were really kind/accommodating to my mom who uses a wheelchair. We got a few different items family style - Yellow Curry Chicken, Shrimp Summer Rolls, Pork Spring Rolls, Yu Choy and Tofu. Everything was very yummy. I particularly like the yu choy and tofu dish. This felt light, but was a great dish. I also really loved the curry flavor, but do wish that the chicken was a little softer as some pieces felt a little more dry. My family also tried the pho (I was too full so didn't end up having), but they really liked it!"

Their menu is super cute, with a lot of watercolor illustrations of the dishes they have. We started by sharing the fresh summer rolls (included 2), which were very refreshing and came out super quickly. I got the lemongrass pork over rice, which came with a fried egg. The flavors were bright and the dish was filling without being too much. I'd like to come back and try out their pho and other dishes!"
387,f_OiLWqldSmNy1MAvtWlPQ,3/9/2022,3 star rating,"I got the pho and a banh mi. For a craving, it did its job and hit the spot. It wasn't bad, it just tasted like any other NYC pho place, which doesn't compare to Houston, LA or any other place highly populated with Vietnamese people.I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if I was in LIC and craving pho again, I would come here, though the prices are a bit high for what you're getting.The pho portion is a good amount and the broth is ok. I asked for spicy on the banh mi and they had Thai chilis in there! I've never had a banh mi that used Thai chilis for spicy. Usually it's sriracha and jalapenos, but I didn't mind the difference."

The meal consists of eggs (I ordered mine scrambled with cheese) , French toast, bacon (I ordered Turkey bacon) and your choice of grits or potatoes. I went with the potatoes. The food is soooooooo good. And did I mention the French toast is the best in the world?!?! All that goodness for $16 which is an absolute win in NY. Peaches has multiple locations and I went to the one on Lewis Ave in Bedstuy. I'll tell you right now if you are the type that doesn't like to be bumped or tight spaces the seating may drive you crazy. Especially if you go for brunch. You're  literally shoulder to shoulder with other patrons. But the food is so good and the service is so fast I just dealt with it. They play R&B music at just the right the volume and the energy is all around positive.It's also worth noting that there are two sides to Peaches with separate entrances. The door with the Peaches awning is not the main entrance. That's the overflow side. If you are facing this awning the doors where the host is located will be to your left a few feet down. It's a residential area so parking will be based on time of day, day of week etc. I went on a Sunday after church around noon and found park one easily around the corner. Overall an awesome dining experience. Go to Peaches and please get you the French toast."

I'll be honest, I wasn't super hungry when I ate here so I didn't get what I wanted (fried chicken) but instead opted for something lighter -- shrimp and collard greens. The collard greens were sooo good (definitely in my top 5). The shrimp were also good, but I feel like it's hard to mess up fried shrimp. I'll come back! They also gave me a complimentary slice of cake for my birthday! Loved that."

Southern black owned restaurant in bedstuy great for groups, a date, or just a solo seat at the bar. The Nashville hot fried shrimp was my favorite packed with flavor and right amount of Nashville the kick was perfect. The Mac and cheese came in second, nice amount of cheese and pull loved the taste. And last but not least the Brooklyn wings were good. They were sweet but with a nice slight kick which evened out the flavor nice crunch to the skin I enjoyed all 3. The drinks were also made well not too much alcohol but enough to have a good time. Our bartender was very friendly music was good and the ambiance was chill. Highly recommend"

The place is kept pretty clean and the open-access soda fountain is a big plus! Definitely use coupons if you have access to those! They help you save so much and get a meal that is worth it. When it gets crowded it can take awhile to receive your order, but if you ask an employee about why you have not received your order yet, they will probably get it for you as soon as possible. As for the food, it is typical Burger King food and I don't have many complaints about it.

402,R77_xh3sCUE0jM73fvCsJQ,11/4/2020,2 star rating,"Had a weird experience today. I pulled into the parking lot at Burger King and ordered some food for curbside pickup. The order was made at 3:48 PM. An important thing to remember if you've never been to this Burger King is that there are two parking lots - one smaller ""back"" parking lot and a larger one that's by the drive-thru speaker. The larger one has the curbside pickup spots. I initially parked in the smaller lot and I thought that maybe they wouldn't find my car so I went to the other parking lot. I waited until a little after 4:00 and I called the restaurant. The person I spoke to sounded a little confused and then said that they ""already gave my food to the driver""?? I asked her to repeat that since it didn't make sense and she confirmed that they gave my food to the driver already. I said that didn't make any sense since I wrote down which car I was in and that I was in the curbside pickup spot. She said she'd be right out, and then someone from the kitchen came with a bag containing my order (not sure if they had it all along or if they hastily made my order again). I asked him what exactly happened with my order and he said he had no idea.All in all, not the best curbside pickup experience I've ever had. The food was not terrible (it's never really bad here) but obviously it didn't taste as good given my experience."

The restaurant looked clean and the service was relatively fast considering the amount of people in the restaurant. When my order was ready they bagged it in a plastic bag for me which was really nice. I also asked for barbecue sauce and I was provided at no extra charge.The restaurant was clean and free of debris and the drink station was fully stocked.No complaints, it was prepared correct and I didn't have to cook it.

But to have that pool table so damn close to the bar and have the people playing pool to RUDELY keep telling patrons TO MOVE, not even ask nicely - is annoying and irritating. They should move that pool table further away from the bar.

It offers a variety of beers on tap and liquor.  Besides the seats that surround the long bar there are about a half dozen high tables of various sizes and big screen TVs playing sports scattered about.  There's a jukebox and photo booth in the back by the rest rooms.  The overall setup is highly geared towards socializing, so it's a good place to hang, meet friends, and watch the game after work or on the way to or from somewhere, like dinner, as the pub has no food.  The strength of Brady's is really the patrons; they can make or break the experience.  I got to spend a few hours there after the St. Patrick's Day Parade, amongst hoardes of locals, firemen, and it was just a great vibe.

It gets a little confusing outside because there is a restaurant next door that looks exactly like it and there is someone outside peddling you to go in there, but it is NOT the same restaurant (you will notice that even though they look identical, that one is empty). Curious as to the story behind it...It's BYOB but luckily there's a liquor store not too far but wish we realized that beforehand so we could have picked something up on the way rather than leave after we ordered. A lot of the things on the menu come as 1 piece/serving so when ordered to share, just be aware of that. The server definitely had us over ordering though because he said it wouldn't be enough. Needless to say we ordered WAY too much and ended up coming home with leftovers, which we still love, but probably would have not ordered quite so much. The ambiance is very fun and lively!"

We were disappointed to realize the menu was pre-fixe when we arrived (wasn't told beforehand or online) without the option to choose which appetizers or entrees we received. The restaurant was decently busy and there were a couple other parties with the same birthday dinner idea. I'm not sure if this caused staff to get overwhelmed, but they were quite unresponsive and rude. They also rushed us and took plates we were still working on. They never even gave us dessert. When it came time for the check, the bill came out higher than expected. If we ordered items off the menu ourselves like we planned, the total would have definitely come out lower. However, we didn't have that option and our bill could've been a made up number for all we know. After we paid, there were other servers coming up to our table saying ""where's my money?"". It was very bizarre and showed a lack of communication on their end. Overall, this dinner wasn't a great experience and left a bad taste in our mouths when it was supposed to be exciting and celebratory. Important things to note: cash only & BYOB"

The chicken tikka masala is bland and tasted like it was made with canned tomatoes and yogurt -- no salt, pepper, etc. Yes, the ambiance is fun, it's BYOB and the prices are very cheap but it isn't worth it. This is Americanized Indian food and everything here is so bland down to the side sauces and raita dipping."

Planned a dinner with a girlfriend and we made it happen.We called for a reservation and didn't have any problem. They reminded us they were located upstairs...for good reason. The restaurant is surrounded by three others that try to copy their style and poach their customers. Luckily, there was a guy posted at the front of Panna II Garden, ready to correct awkward situations. The venue is nothing fancy, but the lights truly are quite magical and fun. Since it wasn't busy, we spent a lot of time taking pictures! Food wise, we tried a number of items. We ordered a lot for a decent price! Here's what I thougt of our meal:Papadam & Chutney - great starter snack. could've used a warning on the spice level for some of the chutney options, but I guess that's part of the fun. Coconut Soup - Honestly seemed like just warmed coconut milk with shredded coconut and some salt. Not necessarily bad, but?? Ground Meat Samosas - These  samosas were tasty and filling, not very memorable though. Chicken Tikka Masala w/ Fresh Naan - I was looking for more sauce and flavor from the chicken. I also wanted the naan to be fluffy. All were lacking.Tandoori Shrimp Mussallam - Flavorful and juicy! Well-spiced. Plain Biryani - I always look forward to the fluffiness that come with biryani, but this really did not deliver at all. Vanilla Ice Cream - complimentary, a nice and simple end to the meal.I did get to try my friend's Mango Lassi, which was excellent! Perfect take quelling the heat from the aforementioned chutney. When we paid for our meal, we didn't receive our change for the longest time, which would have been a 50% tip. That was an awkward end to the meal. Overall, not a great dinner experience at all food or service wise. I admit that I can see myself returning just for the lights, though. All things considered, I still consider this as a cool East Village experience."

The staff was super friendly, apologetic about the fact that they have to close early because of COVID (not their fault). And we met so many nice local men and women! We met a few tourists like us also. Everyone was super chill! No attitude, which sometimes we have a hard time with in Manhattan. Queens is different, IMHO. No cover. And drink prices were average. And I'm sure this bar like many is struggling to stay alive, so we were happy to pay $10-12 per drink. We tried to be generous with tipping also :-) Thanks Hombres!!"

I am thankful that I woke up in my bed 14 hours later and immediately went to the hospital for what I soon found out was a detox of Rohypnol (roofies) found in my blood test. Someone had roofied me. I don't know if it was the bartender or the old man who was talking to me and offering me drinks (that I refused) but it happened and I'm writing this review so that anyone who is ever thinking of going to this awful hell hole thinks twice!

I went to put in my order and the front lady ignored me then finally handed me a menu telling me to order with her and she took the order of someone else that was after me. I told her she skipped me and she said she didn't when I told her the other people didn't even have a menu yet and she took their order. Then she's saying it's because they went to sit down and I told her that doesn't matter cause I was in front of you. VERY RUDE. Wonder if their manager knows.

We were served:Bread & Butter- the butter was a cross between a biscuit and a First Course: Arctic Char & Almond Soup- love seafood so both were on par in terms of taste. I liked the former more while my bf liked the latter more in comparison. Stand alone, they were both great.Second Course: Lobster Squash Agnolotti and Polenta. The Lobster Squash Agnolotti is not one you want to skip. Absolutely amazing!Third Course: Duck & Steak- of all the courses, I rank this one #4. However, the Duck was better than the Steak. Fourth Course: Fig Cheesecake & Chocolate Pudding- Good dessert but maybe I was expecting to be blown by these further.This was my first 5-course dining experience in the city and there were some big hits and only teeny tiny misses. The biggest hits, surprising to my preference, were the vegetarian items served. This makes sense since the head chef specializes in this domain; and personally the star of the night for me was the Squash Lobster Agnolotti. A month later, and I'm still thinking about the agnolotti served there.Expensive meal but you get the best bang for your buck if you go with a +1 and order one of each item on the menu.

We ordered the beef tartare, their flatbread and their chocolate chunk cookie. I will say, the burger was quite delicious. It's not my top burger in NYC, but it is definitely up there. The chips were also quite good, especially when dipped in the onion aioli dip. You can tell they were made with duck fat, they were very rich. The flatbread that we had ordered felt a bit too oily for my taste but it did have some nice flavors on it. The beef tartare was good but I don't dream about it. We all loved our drinks, we got Old Fashions. The standout to me, however, was the milk and cookies. I'm telling you, these are some of the best cookies I've ever had. I encourage you to order these, even if you aren't the biggest dessert person. Overall, a good meal but it's not at the top of my list to come back to.

The Lobster Squash Agnolotti is not one you want to skip. Absolutely amazing!Third Course: Duck & Steak- of all the courses, I rank this one #4. However, the Duck was better than the Steak. Fourth Course: Fig Cheesecake & Chocolate Pudding- Good dessert but maybe I was expecting to be blown by these further.This was my first 5-course dining experience in the city and there were some big hits and only teeny tiny misses. The biggest hits, surprising to my preference, were the vegetarian items served. This makes sense since the head chef specializes in this domain; and personally the star of the night for me was the Squash Lobster Agnolotti. A month later, and I'm still thinking about the agnolotti served there.Expensive meal but you get the best bang for your buck if you go with a +1 and order one of each item on the menu.

We ordered the beef tartare, their flatbread and their chocolate chunk cookie. I will say, the burger was quite delicious. It's not my top burger in NYC, but it is definitely up there. The chips were also quite good, especially when dipped in the onion aioli dip. You can tell they were made with duck fat, they were very rich. The flatbread that we had ordered felt a bit too oily for my taste but it did have some nice flavors on it. The beef tartare was good but I don't dream about it. We all loved our drinks, we got Old Fashions. The standout to me, however, was the milk and cookies. I'm telling you, these are some of the best cookies I've ever had. I encourage you to order these, even if you aren't the biggest dessert person. Overall, a good meal but it's not at the top of my list to come back to.

I would say the return of the concord is delicious, tastes like fruit punch. Morning glory is more on the sour end. We were served warm Angel breads with butter on the side. It was delicious! We ordered the pre-fix lunch menu. As appetizers, we ordered corn agnolotti and autumn green salad. Both were amazing! The autumn green salad had burrata cheese under and apple slices on top. Can't go wrong with it! it was delicious. For the entrees: swordfish and snowdance farm chicken. They were decent, but not comparable to the appetizers. We also ordered bacon and cheeseburger off the menu as an added entree. The burger and the sauce were good, but nothing special. The beef patty and the burger sauce were good. Desserts: chocolate pudding and caramelized cheesecake. I loved the chocolate pudding. The popcorn inside wasn't necessary in my opinion. The caramelized cheesecake came with a fig sorbet and a fig itself. Enjoyed it very much! Lastly, we ordered the pumpkin martini which was good too.

490,HD0e3eHwv573qHZOJJitWg,6/24/2022,5 star rating,"How do you define the perfect meal? Food can only taste so good, so the meals that stick with me come down to the memories. Sometimes I meet somebody fascinating at the bar, sometimes it's an exceptionally lovely waitress that I never forget. Or sometimes the flavors, textures, and temperatures of what you eat are so perfect, that they provoke dreams.Yes, for the first time ever, I had a dream about the food I had at a restaurant. I came into Aurora Soho for lunch two days ago, after my parents suggested it. I ordered the Cacio e Pepe. Walking out of the restaurant, I'm not sure I even realized I'd just had one of the greatest meals of my life. There was nothing revolutionary about the dish, no flavors I'd never had before, it wasn't a creative or novel rendition of the classic Italian pasta, it was simply, as far as I'm concerned, the dish in its perfect form. The noodles, perfectly thick, and perfectly al dente. The sauce, perfectly rich and perfectly subtle. The pepper, perfectly ground and dispersed so only once or twice through the meal I got a little bite of intense spice. The rest of the day, I couldn't stop thinking about it, it was constantly in the back of my mind. Gastronomy is art, and like art, there is something going on beyond our conscious response to its presentation. If we can't trust our memories, our dreams, to tell us when we've experienced something exceptional, then we are not true art critics. Aurora Soho is a restaurant where masters perform. Masters of creativity, maybe not, but masters who through skill and understanding create the highest example of their craft. Perhaps not masters like Picasso or Dali, but masters like Caravaggio, or Matisse. ""For, Picasso is the better artist, but Matisse is the better painter."""

We had made a reservation for Saturday afternoon through opentable, which was super simple and quick, just in case it would be busy as NYC is opening up again. When we arrived, the host seated us within 5 mins. There are both indoor and outdoor seatings available with plexiglass separating different groups for Covid guidelines, which I really liked because it was slightly crowded. Our waitress (shoutout to Guadalupe) was amazing and so attentive to what we needed. Gave us enough time to look over the menu, and throughout our time there, was proactively checking on us and refilling our water.There are so many diverse options and to our surprise, the portion sizes were greater than expected. We got the Nutella French toast, prosciutto Benedict and crab Benedict with a side of truffle fries. Definitely worth every single bite and price! Everything was cooked and seasoned so well. They also have lots of drinks available, kinda strong though. Overall, I really liked the experience here from the food to the service to the ambiance. Absolutely recommend!!!"

It started out somewhat promising: excellent spritzer with an aperitif called cappelletti. Think if Aperol and Campari had a sweeter, more floral baby. Appetizers were delicious: croquettes which were basically oblong arancini with a yummy truffle sauce. Hubby ordered the grilled artichokes. Very tasty. The entree is where the meal went terribly wrong. We ordered the ribeye for two. Our server told us it would be about 32oz and some of it would be bone. Cool. Dear reader, it was not cool. What came out was about 32oz of protein of which only about 4oz was edible. Aside from bone it was all gristle. Not delicious ribeye marbling. It was nasty, fatty gristle. Think Old 96'er from The Great Outdoors (RIP John Candy). Our server checked on us and my husband stepped aside and let him know how unacceptable it was to charge $125 for mostly gristle. They gracefully took it off the bill and now it's 11:15 and I'm starving and stuck on the West Side Highway. TL;DR: don't eat here.Edit: my husband wanted me to add that the server was very good and we tipped him well. We felt bad that he has to work at such a scammy place."

So horrible I had to stop and write this for the possible benefit of other human beings.To start with, their NYC tap water (by all accounts the best tap water in the whole world) had a burnt oil smell. Took forever to get a simple order of a few burgers. Our bill was so late I had to take a walk to the cashier to see what was going on - all workers having a chat while we waited. When the bill arrived, there was a total (including the tip, already printed on the bill - I guess that is a new thing, ""mandatory ti""p) - and an open value for ""more tip please""?? I guess they assumed we were not locals? Go figure. The waiter *really* wanted us to pay in cash - why, I don't know - quite insisting actually.While we waited for our check, we had more than enough time to watch huge rats peacefully strolling around tables and patrons. :barf:Yes indeed, quite a horrible experience. If I could give zero stars, that's what you would see in this review. Anyhow, if you want to visit the place, try checking it out on Halloween for a matching experience."
505,EGS6y6WsPkNs8PZ2X6bHOA,8/9/2021,3 star rating,"While in the middle of a busy area of SoHo, this restaurant stands out a bit as your regular burger joint without any major fancy frills. The outdoor dining setup is pretty nice and extremely spacious - given that I thought their food is just fine, I am impressed they are able to keep their business going (it also wasn't very crowded when we went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon). I ordered the Plant Based burger, and there was a menu of 4-5 specific vegetarian options which was nice. The burger was just fine - nothing to sneeze at, although the patty was one of the largest I'd ever seen. It was ~$15, so I was surprised it didn't come with fries/pickles on the side; it was stuffed with lettuce and had a couple of pickles but that's it. We got fries on the side which were quite good. This place is solid but probably would not come back given how many other options are around it."

Painkiller was fine but a bit too orange-juice heavy. Not enough people working -- difficult to get our order taken / flag down a waiter.

She was impatient and had an attitude very stuck up girl. She clearly doesn't know how to socialize or be nice to the businesses patrons. She walked past our table A FEW times after seeing 5 plates piled up and refused to take them. She made the bus boy do all the labor and could care less that our table was completely cluttered!!! She must be mad she has to tip out the busboy & makes him work for his $2 she gives him.  Also no napkins were given, or offers for refills. The thing that made me post this was when an old man in his 80s **eating ALONE** asked her to wrap up his food , she replied with ""I'll get you a box""........ Ummm the poor old man shouldn't have to sit there & pack up his own food with his fingers after asking for the server who's job it is.  What happened to customer service?! Atleast do it for the old man. The hostess as always was the classiest & sweetest employee in the place. Oh and the orange juice was disgusting and watered down!!!! They need to get Tropicana!!!!!"

Several blocks away from my old high school haha.Nonetheless, it's good food with decent prices and friendly staff. Their chairs are a bit clunky but comfortable. I don't recall much of their decor besides the chairs. Had a basic order for an impromptu dinner here; spicy salmon and a ginza roll. Also ordered a taro bubble tea which was really good. My friend had a more complex order which I didn't bother to figure out because he simply pointed to the pictures in the menu sooo it should be easy to replicate if you recognize it from my photos lol.If I were in the area more, they'd probably be my go to! I recommend checking it out. I'll try to stop by again and order more interesting menu items, but alas this is all I have for now.

Went in for lunch one weekday and while most restaurants in the area are typically teeming with customers, this place had only 2 other tables occupied. That's the first red flag. Second red flag is the exorbitantly high prices for rolls. The reason, buy one get one ""free."" This place is a joke, service is nice but the food is subpar at best. Fish is lacking in flavor and pieces are small. Paid for two salmon roe sashimi ala carte and the eggs were not fresh at all. Shriveled and not glossy, they seemed to be a few days old at the least.The kicker?They charged me $1.00 for sriracha in a saucer, you know, like if you go to a reputable restaurant and ask for a condiment. Charged me also $1.00 for spicy mayo served as a condiment. Im surprised my glass of water wasn't $0.25 for the ice and $0.10 for the cup.Credit card machine was down so they took my card number down. Told them I was on a lunch break and I needed to go. They took their time and didn't tell me the machine was down till I got up and walked to the register and asked what was going on they took almost an hour and a half. I wouldn't come here for a free meal let alone pay for one again. Stay away from this place."

I like their bogo free appetizer and special rolls when dining in. I usually order the sunomono, rock shrimp or Star Wars. I like the sunomono. The quality of the fish is not bad and I like the sauce that's drizzle over it. The rock shrimp and Star Wars are very similar. They are both fried shrimp but with different sauce. The rolls are pretty cheap compared to the city. It runs from $3 and up and they have a good selection of rolls. This is one of the few places that have mango and apple rolls. I like the eel mango roll, tempura rolls, futo maki and Alaskan roll. I order the spicy salmon and tuna sometimes but I prefer their other rolls. From the special rolls I usually get the dragon roll and soft shell crab. Our bill usually comes out to be around $40-$50 for two people and we are always full."

I love the buy 1 get 1 deal they always have for house special rolls. This spot always serves big pieces of sushi as each roll is stuffed with filling. I personally enjoy the Mega million roll and Volcano roll. The restaurant could use a decorative update but it seems most of its business is from take out so this may not be necessary. It is never packed and there's always plenty of empty tables. The service is good and rolls come relatively fast. The waitress gave me and my friends free green tea ice cream one night!

I ordered seaweed mushroom soup, two veggie rolls (oshinko and a custom roll) as well as two pieces of inari from the a la carte menu. I also had tea to drink and it was perfectly brewed, no bitter taste from over-steeping. (Simple but important detail!)I felt it was a good amount of food for me though if you are hangry you could throw in an appetizer or another roll for good measure. They also have teriyaki veg options if you want something more filling. Not sure if it's a marketing gimmick but I like that they offer low sodium soy sauce. (Americans tend to abuse salt). The ambiance was nice and service was really friendly. My server was very sweet and patient and kept refilling my tea without me even having to ask. I asked her if they could make a custom roll for me with avocado, cucumber, and mango (I really wanted something with mango) and they happily obliged. Prices are super reasonable and they have great vegan and vegetarian options for rolls. Usually you only see the avo-cucumber option but they had a full section! I want to try the fried banana roll next time.  The only negative is I wish they had non-disposable chopsticks and cloth napkins for dining-in. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone that is plant-based."

Extra seating upstairs as well.Today I ordered the Jimmy T on a ciabatta bread. Good choice in my opinion.

They are currently running an April madness event with a featured sandwich on different days of the week.

It has proven to be a solid bar choice with every single half a dozen times that I've been here. Bartenders are super friendly and quick with the cocktails, which are always strong and leave me without complaints. The beer selection is plentiful and offers a decent variety. Sure, the bathrooms are a tad on the gross side and the smokers completely take over the small outdoor space, but neither of those things is enough to keep me away. I would describe the overall ambiance as fancy divey - dark, fairly large, yet somehow still cozy. I am all about their skylight - unique feature for a bar of this caliber. More times than not, I stay out way too late when I hit the Manor, but it's hard not to with their great music that always keeps me humming along and makes me forget that they stay open until 4am most nights.

Walking in, I heard Mac Miller playing in the background and a great crowd enjoying what appeared to be finely crafted cocktails (not a margarita mix in sight) and I knew Yelp had led us in the right direction once again.The bartender, a casually dressed dude with a beard,  greeted us at the bar and asked what we had in mind. They had a nice little cocktail menu, but I was unsure and let him know I was leaning towards something whiskey-based, that wasn't sweet, and wasn't your typical old fashioned. He quickly suggested something he'd been making which was similar to an old fashioned but with a sick kick from ancho chili syrup. This drink, along with a tequila and sherry drink my companion ordered, was right on the mark. It wasn't too sweet (which for me, is a low barrier), and the bite hit you at the end in a subtle fashion towards the back of the throat. My friend's drink left a taste of sherry in your mouth that was delightful and helped me forget about the tequila (bad past with tequila).Beyond that, the ambiance and music went from great, to epic. With Mystical playing as we were leaving, making me reminisce HARD about those nights out at the club in college. Ahhh, the early 2000s... May we never forget...The highlight of the bar though was the bartender. I didn't catch his name, but this dude would have me coming back night after night. And the tunes."

Flora is run by kind and attentive owners who serve high quality and delicious food. They have an authentic (I know this word doesn't mean much these days but it's true) approach with many imported italian ingredients. Everything is dependably delicious; my favorites are the burrata (sometimes available as an appetizer and sometimes in pasta), eggs in purgatory, and meatballs. They also have hard to find (actual) Italian sodas like chinotto and spuma nera which have flavors more similar to herbal bitters than sweet soda flavors. The spuma nera, served with a slice of lemon and ice, tastes like an aperitivo (almost like a cynar spritz!m)! Highly, highly recommend Flora for an afternoon drink, coffee, lunch or dinner."

Nice if simple looking outdoor tables, etcWe quickly discovered it has ""those chumps won't know the difference"" written all over it. The welcome was lukewarm -possibly because we have kids?? Which reminds me there are no kids menu options. The selection was very small - which would have been fine had the dishes turned out to be good. Not so; we ordered a pasta dish that was basically tasteless and over-drenched in olive oil - (and I really love olive oil!!) Seemed completely overpriced especially considering the excellent competition nearby, be it Provini or Piccoli or Bonafini across the park in PLG.

I scarfed it down too fast and forgot to take a picture, but I'll definitely be back. The dish was around $19, it comes with mixed greens and bread with olive oil all together plated nicely. Definitely filling! It wasn't drenched in tomato sauce and the eggplant was sliced not too thin or thick, you were able to really taste the eggplant texture. Their dinner menu isn't big, a few entrees and pasta, some sides. This must mean their other dishes are just as good. Not a place to come if you're looking for fettuccine Alfredo. The family comes from Italy and I believe they source a lot of their ingredients from their too.I'm a fan, and definitely want to come back to try their brunch.

We ordered the arugula salad and  mozzarella di Bufala to start. We ordered the fish special, fusilli con gamberetti and the eggplant parmesan. The arugula salad tasted fine but the pear was brown when served which makes me think it's old or not fresh? The bufala was good. The fish was mushy and pretty bland tasting minus the tomato sauce it comes with. The pasta was bland, texture was good though. The eggplant parmesan was not good. It was way too over baked or something and I honestly wasn't sure what I was eating.We finished off with the Chocolate Cake with almond flour and the sheep ricotta. The cake was good but the ricotta was so gamey it was like you're licking the sheep's private parts. My friend gagged on it. The service was great. Our waiter was extremely friendly and it's a cute place to sit and chill. Personally I'm not a fan of their food so I can't say I'll be back for seconds."

""Brunch"" without eggs and only select items offering greens or sides; one salad was just chunks of cheese with very hard toasted bread and bitter arugula.I want so badly for these guys to succeed but the fact is, their strengths are those of a café (buttery pastries, bread, coffee) but their size and menu reach toward being a restaurant. It's really confusing even for a European-American couple to navigate. Hopefully they take this as constructive criticism because the neighborhood could use this place.

We originally planned to go to a popular Mediterranean spot a block up, but there was a long wait at 1230pm on a Saturday. So we walked down and found Flora. All three outdoor tables were miraculously open, and they could accommodate 4 adults and 2 kids (though no high chairs for the 2 year old). I was grateful we found it, as there weren't many other options nearby, and we were a large group during a busy weekend brunch/lunch rush. The service was good, we were checked on frequently, though they did seem to forget my cocktail, which they quickly rectified. The food was fine - the menu was authentically Italian, even the sodas were Italian branded. The portions were small-medium, was fine for us. I had the tomato mozzarella panini - it was average. The side salad was tiny. The pasta bowl looked sizable and ideal for the kids. My cocktail - the Venetian Spritz not only was pretty but delicious (and strong!). My cousin liked his Italian beer so much, he ordered a second. The kids enjoyed, as they had plenty of space to explore outside (as well as chat with the neighbors at the next table!). Overall a pleasant outdoor dining experience."

As two people who traveled for years to Italy, we go here weekly and primarily because the food is fresh and delicious. For those who complain about the ""small portions"" you might be better off going to the Olive Garden. Service is great. Many wonderful things that remind us of Italy. Our Italian friends who live in NYC say it's one of the most authentic Italian restaurants and are also regulars. If you want a big bowl of pasta filled with salt and red sauce with free refills check out the Olive Garden. If you want actual Italian style food come here."

The menu is so extensive today I picked two sushi (1) firecracker roll which included tuna, crunch, eel sauce, spicy mayo,  shrimp tempura, crabmeat, cucumber, avocado; (2)  HEART ATTACK: spicy salmon, spicy mayo sauce with soft shell crab and spicy tuna and avocado.  Both choices were delicious, great  presentation! The service was excellent ! Due to COVID19 there is no indoor dining but you can order ahead and pick up or order while you are outside the restaurant and then go around the neighborhood while you wait for your order. There are plenty of stores to visit while your order is being prepared.  I most definitely recommend this place for your sushi cravings!"

Maybe it was something else I ate. Maybe I was constipated. Shit happens, you know? (pun intended)I gave Sushi 33 a second chance because I have a never-ending craving for sushi, and I do not want to break the bank. I ordered a few pieces of sushi and a few rolls.

I wish it was warmer indoors mid-December because I had to keep my coat on while eating. I ordered their egg with veggies over rice with fried tofu, oddly this was served packed in a tin container while my sushi and miso was on plates. The omlet was great tasting but a nice presentation would've added some appetite stimulating points. The fried tofu was soggy could be because the moisture from it being packed in the container or because they added sauce over it than below it or both. A nice crunch to contrast everything would've hit the spot. All in all I will come back and give it another try."

The restaurant itself looks like your average NYC Chinese restaurant but it's cozy inside with Japanese emblems and artifacts. The sushi is made right at the front counter and the place is clean. Parking can be a little tough but I usually go after 7 pm when it isn't as bad. Definitely a must try! (Their spicy crabmeat roll is also really good!)

Since the restaurant is pretty small, the staff are attentive and your order also comes fast. While I can't say that it's the freshest or best sushi I've ever had, it is definitely decent for it's price. I haven't had any bad experiences with the service or food in the three to four times I've been there.Recommended for one of those Netflix and chill nights. For date night? Maybe not.."
568,7KvhIbqUyJ-B_37hOh4PxA,8/18/2015,4 star rating,"When the munchies grabbed ahold of us late one night, we desperately scoured Yelp, looking for a place to grab a bite. It seemed like this place was the only one in the area that was open but when my fiancé saw the lone dollar sign next to the accompanied 'sushi bar' label, he was wary. ""Um...cheap sushi usually means bad sushi,"" he warned, already looking for other alternatives. Unfortunately, everything else was closed and fatal hunger eventually overtook suspicion. We're so glad it did. Two blocks off of the busy Queens Boulevard, Sushi 33 sits tucked away on a quieter street. Its diminutive size (there are about six tables in the small space, tops) and bare decor make it all the more unassuming, but they rock those low prices like no other sushi joint I've ever seen.  We ordered solely from their roll menu, none of which were more than $3.75, but our eyes widened as we perused the other pages, especially the tempura platters and sushi combos, which were also decently priced. Special rolls like spider rolls and others with fun names like Heart Attack (soft shell crab, spicy tuna, and avocado on the inside; spicy salmon, spicy mayo, and eel sauce on the outside) are understandably a little more expensive, but still very reasonable. Sushi and sashimi a la carte items are sold by the piece, and each are only a dollar. We ordered a mango salmon roll, sweet potato rolls, and something called the A.A.C roll, which had asparagus, avocado, and cucumber. We liked all three and particularly loved the sweet potato roll, which says that it's precooked on the menu but seemed surprisingly warm when we chowed down. Some of the pieces seemed more tempera than sweet potato, but for $3.25, I was happy. The service was prompt, friendly, and it was nice to be able to see the chef freshly preparing our rolls right at the sushi bar. Best of all, we were able to enjoy a decent sushi meal for two for  around $13, which I consider an amazing deal. The restaurant seemed clean and the ingredients fresh. I'm terribly glad we have a place like this in the neighborhood, and because it's open until 11 at night, we'll be sure to come by again when the late night tummy rumbles strike again.Added plus: the full menu and online ordering for deliveries are available online at beyondmenu.com/21956/new… ($10 minimum for free deliveries)"

They have social distancing markers on the floor. If people want to order takeout in person they should be allowed to. This would be much less of a cluster F than making everyone order on the app and congregate on the skinny sidewalk with oodles of maskless Doordash/Uber Eats/wherever they're from couriers where nobody is more than 2.5 feet apart let alone 6 feet.Back in the late summer and fall before indoor dining was restored they allowed you in to order. Don't know why they went back to this asinine setup with the security guard playing bouncer, doorman and waiter. If I order at 4pm and the app says 4:15 pickup, I shouldn't be waiting for my food at 4:27pm. If locations in midtown let you go in to order I don't see why this one can't.

Nonetheless, Soogil was an incredible and DELICIOUS experience. The dishes were so creative, fresh, flavorful, and every one of them melted in my mouth. The timing of the tasting menu was a tiny bit rushed - I personally was way too full by the second to last dish (the kind of full that results when you eat too fast). I could barely make room for dessert, which is unheard of for me. Speaking of dessert, the jenga tower was probably my least favorite dish, but I'm guessing that's because I'm not huge on black sesame flavored things and because I was about to keel over and perish from how full I was. Soogil is also a relatively affordable tasting menu, so I would definitely try to make a reservation if you anticipate being in the area!"

They were very kind in writing happy birthday and having a candle on the plate :) they were also able to make substitutes for my pescatarian friend and a mock tail for me. I thought the presentation of all the dishes were beautiful and my favorite was the caviar tuna that came out first. We didn't do any of the add ons and were quite full. The Jenga tower (not pictured) dessert was yummy but the pieces of fried dough were a lot so didn't finish eating those.

Some dishes were even great, and you can tell from the photos. But the service? Probably the worst, and I really like to think I'm lenient. I came 5 minutes early to my reservation and they made me feel like I was hours early. I had to wait outside for 30 minutes in the winter time. We were seated and the first course came out promptly, but after that we waited at least 30 minutes between each course. After the 2nd course, we were waiting for so long that one of the younger staff members offered us complimentary champagne which was nice... BUT one of the head waiters (or so it seemed) who sat us down and explained the menu in the beginning FORGOT about us and REINTRODUCED himself to us after the 3rd course.... My boyfriend and I had to remind him that we were waiting for our 4th course... We asked him when our course would be coming and he said he would check on it right away. After that, whenever he brought in a new course he said ""is that fast enough"" in an extremely condescending way. Even when we left, he mentioned how we came too early and made it seem like it was our fault. So condescending and rude, especially for a $4-500 dinner. Felt the worst for my lovely boyfriend who was so excited to take me out."

My favorite was the sun choke coup, though it's hard to pick one stand out. For dessert, I preferred the jenga tower over the foie gras + dalgona, but that's because I'm not a huge foie gras fan and the mousse with the sweet jelly and ice cream was a bit bizarre for me. I opted out of the additional course and was quite full by the end.The staff was also so friendly and accommodating -- when I jokingly said my cocktail wasn't strong enough, he offered to add more soju to it -- and the restaurant is really quaint and peaceful.

By far one of my favorites for the night, I had my doubts on such a simple dish but it blew us away Scallop - the salad has a refreshing contrast to the scallop, and the scallops themselves are tender and great flavor Foie gras - I've only had foie gras once before and had mixed feelings, but this was pretty good! Soft and went down smoothlyShort ribs - medium rare and savory, what else could you ask forUni bowl - definitely worth trying, and a good amount of uni. Very soft and tasted fresh Mango panna cotta - soo refreshing and fresh. Zi liked this more than the churro tower but my dinner partner liked the churros more. To each their own"

The ingredients were all super fresh, and each bite truly brought out the flavors of each ingredient.

I was right to say the least. I am grateful that I had matcha latte at Café that specialize in making there drinks from scratch. No commercial short cuts to be precise. Starbucks matcha latte was soooo creamy it threw me off. Like it was too creamy. It honestly some how felt like creamer was in it instead of milk. It just was too thick. I just don't even know how to describe it. It's not even on their menu. I just ask them because my co worker was getting something to drink for me. Matcha Latte is a bit grainy. It's basically green tea. So it's a bit strong but good. The taste you kinda got to get use to. So I can understand why maybe this is the reasoning behind Starbucks creating a creamy one. Something easy that people would like.Unfortunately, I don't like it because I got introduce to original matcha latte early on. so if your like me you will likely not like it. If you never had matcha ever and don't mind a creamer version, then hit any Starbucks for it. I personally don't think it's great because of the fact that's it's not on your menu. I guess it's apart of the Ghost Starbucks menu. Ha! Who knew it existed."

En-route to this location I place my mobile order and ""cha-ching!"" off with my $6 Starbucks goes before I even step foot inside the store.In NYC I frequently use mobile ordering & think it's a travesty that not every business doesn't embrace this concept. This Starbucks location is one of those rare locations that seems to not only want to take your $6 before you arrive but they want to ransom your beverage upon arrival. When I got there I saw no ""mobile order"" display as I'm accustomed to at other locations. It seems the staff holds my beverage freaking hostage behind the counter making me insist on handing over what I paid for.

605,l7xJlfmn8N4DD1oxfR_rIA,5/17/2019,1 star rating,This location is probably the most under staff Starbucks I ever been to. It was 2:00pm in the afternoon and I had to wait 19 mins for my grande ice coffee. Two people at the register. One person wiping down and cleaning and two people making drinks. I counted 21 people waiting for drinks. When I got my drink I noticed people waiting before me were still waiting for their drinks. People had this annoy look. Piss poor store management. Not a good customer experience.

I was right to say the least. I am grateful that I had matcha latte at Café that specialize in making there drinks from scratch. No commercial short cuts to be precise. Starbucks matcha latte was soooo creamy it threw me off. Like it was too creamy. It honestly some how felt like creamer was in it instead of milk. It just was too thick. I just don't even know how to describe it. It's not even on their menu. I just ask them because my co worker was getting something to drink for me. Matcha Latte is a bit grainy. It's basically green tea. So it's a bit strong but good. The taste you kinda got to get use to. So I can understand why maybe this is the reasoning behind Starbucks creating a creamy one. Something easy that people would like.Unfortunately, I don't like it because I got introduce to original matcha latte early on. so if your like me you will likely not like it. If you never had matcha ever and don't mind a creamer version, then hit any Starbucks for it. I personally don't think it's great because of the fact that's it's not on your menu. I guess it's apart of the Ghost Starbucks menu. Ha! Who knew it existed."

Walked in here around 4:45pm and it wasn't busy at all. Was able to go right up to the counter and order my drink. The dude was nice and took my order and I was able to scan the free birthday drink on my phone. I got the venti size because the free drink can be used for any sizes. If it is your birthday, make sure to open up your Starbucks app and use your free drink on the largest size possible to get most out of your freebie. The lady made my drink pretty quickly. Probably had to wait like a minute and it was ready. Was able to located some straws on the end of the counter. The island didn't have them. I also asked for a bag and another guy was nice enough to give me a bag. There are also seating upstairs. Nice Starbucks. Not too crowded and pretty chill spot to sip on some coffee after work."

We were in there for about 5 minutes, and this guy almost knocked the door down and threatened to call the cops on us for using their filthy bathroom.

The barista made one/two of my drink and handed it to me. I still stood there because I was still missing one. They obviously acknowledge the fact that I was still there but didn't ask what else I needed til I said excuse me. Service was extremely slow. There was two people at bar. There's no reason for it to take more than 5 mins to make a drink. The store wasn't busy at all. Also I ordered a drink with whipped cream. I did not get my whipped cream. I'll probably go to a different location around since there's plenty!"

For you the customer you should be able to make your own decision yourself and decide whether you want to tip more than 18% for Bad Service  or not . Waiter skimmed or conned . They have the Ba#* to ask you by CROWDING you and following you if you stand up   IS everything okay ? It's definitely not OK . Im not CHEAP but I am a professional and definitely not STUPID . I'm an Astoria native many other great places to try . I wish the manager the best of luck he or she may not know .

Bland and the sauce they used is like something one would get from the local grocery store shelves. It borders on criminal!The presentation is not what I expected. I have never seen Thai food served where they put the Curry and rice all together on a plate for you. That is how they served ""Green Curry with Rice."" Usually the Curry and Rice are served separate and you are then in charge of mixing your meal. Expect lots of rice and very little Chicken.The Red Curry with Noodle was presented in a similar manner. I did not have either meals but the feedback was that it was ok.I shared the spicy noodle dish, which was not as spicy as I would have liked. I ended up asking for Green Chilis to add to the spice level and that made the meal more palatable. Overall, not my place for Thai food. I felt that Joya fell way short in making good, tasty Thai food. Their fare is probably more suited to an Americanized bland palate; if you are serious about Thai food, this is not the place for you.I would have given this place two stars but the bathroom was smelly and the service slow so 1 star it is.We concluded that this visit was a one and done!"

We ordered the epitome of basic Thai food - pad Thai, pad see yue, spring rolls, chicken satay... Ummm the best pad see yue I've ever had! First off, it came with a lemon wedge which was the perfect shot of acid. The chicken was plentiful and really juicy... not to typical dry chicken breast strips you sometimes get. The sauce on the noodles was really well balanced. The noodles themselves were really well cooked, not too soft even though they had been sitting in a takeout container. Such a pleasant surprise!  The spring rolls were, of course, excellent. Delivery was efficient and timely. Will definitely be reordering Joya again!"
663,pSSajdYNKTyAGV8-fk7fWQ,8/25/2022,2 star rating,"My partner  and I love Joya's food as it's extremely delicious, fresh and we have been there so many times that  we can't count. My review is not related to the food, it's directed to the quality of service. We usually go there on weekends but this week we went on a Wednesday evening. So, to begin the man seating us had quite an attitude with us but I didn't let that get to me and moved on. Then the young waitress was kind off rushing us to order so we asked for fried calamari and right off she said there was none.!!!!! So while we deciding which appetizers we would order she again came back to take our orders and out of the blue.... She said she was informed that they DO have calamari. So we ordered it. During this process she never asked anybody neither went to the kitchen to ask!!!!! So then we placed or entrees order and more than 45 went by which by then a party of 6 People came in 25 mins after us and they got their food in less than 8 mins !!!!  While the waitress delivered their plates  she realized I was watching her and then she and another server were at POS Machine giving us looks and talking about us. So by then my partner went in to talk to the host and he had this careless attitude and never checked on our food. But by then 19 mins later our food was delivered to our table ""lukewarm""  and I'm pretty sure our food was just waiting to be picked up. Anyway we began to eat and the waitress ame by to ask how was everything and I told her nicely that in all the years we have been coming here we have never waited so long for our food, and then she gave us this sad story that she was working alone !!!!!.  But then we felt we were being rushed to finish our food. Mind you when we go to Joya on weekends the place is packed and food is always brought to us within under 8 mins not 45 mins with an attitude plus she forgot to bring cutlery and when we asked for the hot sauces she gave us a lecture and said no. I had to tell her we always order calamari and get the four sauces to dip the calamari. Anyway. From now on I will not go to Joya on a weeknight. To me this was a huge dissatisfaction and disappointment as I did work in the food Industry for more than 22 years and this was not the way I expect to be treated when I'm paying !!!!!!  So instead of keep looking at your cellphone you should pay more attention to the customers just like the water boy/ bus boy he was so nice to everyone and was working his ass off. I also wanted to be known that we love this place ambience and cleanliness but customer service needs to improve fast as I have always invite people to come and try but if you keep treating people like this you'll know what is gonna happen. The weekend staff seems to know what to do. The Wednesday staff are so lost. ( except the bartender!!!! And the kitchen staff)Oh and also and Asian kitchen staff kept fighting and arguing with the host they our entire stay at the place. They were so damn loud it wasn't nice."

I ordered the pad Thai, the red curry noodles (in pictures, I also have a video), and the spicy chicken and pineapple fried rice. Though I didn't receive the best customer service while ordering, I didn't pay too much mind to it because I just wanted some food. I hadn't eaten all day and it was already around 2/3 in the afternoon. When I got the food, which came out pretty fast (within 10 mins of waiting), I went straight to my car and started sharing some food with my sisters. It wasn't until I got in the middle of my bowl of red curry that I saw the longest hair. The hair was at least 6-8 inches long. I know that this was not my hair because I have short 4C hair that is currently loc'd. I immediately went back to the restaurant to return the food and receive a full refund. When I got back, the same man was there and I explained to him there was a hair in my red curry. He tried to get me to refund the one bowl only, which I then explained to him that I wanted my full refund back. He asked if there was anything wrong with the rest of the food and I told him I was uncomfortable consuming the rest after finding the hair in my bowl, and the conversation stopped there.He did a post void for my order and without a word, put my receipt on the counter and walked away. I would like to add, he didn't hand me the receipt and it almost flew off of the counter and he walked away without even an apology.If I could rate 0 stars, I would. The customer service was absolutely terrible. I would never recommend this place, even to my worst enemy."

Breakfast with your parents, late night meals after a night at the nightclubs, diners seemed to be a part of some great memories.This diner has the classic look and feel of a diner. Service was casual and friendly. Probably my most frequently ordered food at a diner was the Pizza Burger Deluxe, a burger topped with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese served with french fries, coleslaw, and possibly a few onion rings. So, my roadmap of memories demanded I get this personally iconic meal. Along with it, I also ordered an Atlantic chowder, a Manhattan clam chowder that the diner felt it was important to make their namesake soup.The soup was pretty good and served with sliced bread I stead of the standard bag of oyster crackers, truly a nice touch and gave you a feeling of indulgence. While I prefer the creamy New England style clam chowder, the tomato based broth of the Manhattan style clam chowder is a nice alternative and, as a side note, was my father's favorite way of having clam chowder (another memory connection).The Pizza Burger Deluxe was also good. It captured my memories of late nights and youth, of innocent childhood, and made me also realize what made me love this style of burger in the first place. Tomato sauce and mozzarella perfectly compliment a burger.One of my dining companions had t but e turkey club and it looked pretty amazing, as well.If you find yourself in this neighborhood, this is a good choice for a meal. I recommend a visit."

Mind you the picture on the menu showed a well press crusted brown sandwich. The service was equally bad, was seated quickly and ordered coffee, tasted burnt like the last bit in the pot on the fire and this is about seven on a friday evening. They took over twenty minutes to come take our order although the place was almost empty. Had to ask for the cole slaw and pickle that came with the meal. Come time to pay there wasn't any one who was able to open the register to take our payment, waited fifteen minutes to pay. Can't image how this establishment  can function and make money like this, every one seemed to be clueless... Will stick with Classic Diner a few blocks away."

The iced chocolate is a refreshing treat on a hot day as well as the other iced drinks.  The pastries look pretty good and I was a little hungry, so we tried an egg and tomato croissant.  Too bad they haven't gotten their oven/toaster working yet because the croissant would have tasted really good if it had been warm and toasty.  Luckily, we heated it up at the office, thank you/no thank you very much.  Hope these guys are around when it gets cooler so that we can try some of their hot drinks."

I came in because I saw the $2 everything sign and compared to all the coffee shop nearby it sounded like a deal. However not EVERTHING is $2. The egg on a bagel is $2.50. I thought they charged me incorrectly the first time I brought it so I brought it again just to confirm. They also have seasonal drinks or specials for $3. Spacious place but not a lot of seating. 4 small round tables with 2 seats and couple of bar stool by the windows. I didn't try any of their drinks but a lot of people do stop by and order them. I have been stopping by here for sandwiches only so this review is solely based on the sandwiches. Egg on a bagel - egg, tomato and bagel. They bagel was hard and tasted like it's been out for a long time. Tuna sandwich - it was pretty good. I had it toasted and the staff did a good job at it. He was able to make the bread warm but kept the tuna cold. Egg on a croissant - egg, tomato and croissant. The egg was so salty...Egg and avocado - egg, avocados and croissant.

Also can't forget to mention that every item on their menu is $2 (plus, La Colombe coffee!). Can't beat these prices and you also can't miss them - they're advertising their products and space pretty well, with their prime location directly across the street from Starbucks.I'll definitely be back for a quick coffee and snack in the near future."

It comes with chopped up pieces of pork with more minced meat at the bottom. The noodles are a bit thicker than the tamashii ramen. It is definitely not the traditional ramen flavors, more soy sauce forward in my opinion. The tamashii ramen was on the lighter broth side, not as creamy or umami as I expected. The noodles for this are also thinner. We ended up mixing the two broths back and forth to balance out the flavors. Overall it's decent ramen.

The chicken was absolutely delicious but portion was lacking, unfortunately. For $3, I expected a bit more than 5 small chunks. The egg had a nice soft boil and complemented the bowl nicely.

It is a full meal indeed and very satisfying.

When the ""error"" was found and corrected, no apology from the curt and cold staff member. Staff encountered on my stay was kind and accommodating. The hotel well situated, close enough to lots of visitors sights, but removed enough from the overwhelming crowd is a bit dated, for Sofitel hotels are usually swankier than this location; example the Washington DC one.

It is indeed one New York's better hotels. It's one of those that are, of course, pricey, around $400/night range when add all those pesky little things in like taxes, resident fees, destination fees, etc., etc., etc. But if you want to be in a hotel with the best of staff and a super location near Rockefeller Plaza, Times Square and Broadway, this is the place and well worth the premium price. I was in room #1804 and couldn't have asked for anything better. The décor of it had a certain understated elegance and the bathroom was complete with a shower along with a completely separate and individual tub. The hotel has one of the best of concierge services ever along with Gaby, a very good in house restaurant and bar. But I might add that Sofitel is located near some of the best restaurants of New York, which for a foodie Yelper like myself makes everything super special. Besides the high price with all the silly add-ons of destination fees, resident fees, etc. (but this is true of every hotel in New York) the only other minus I found was a totally crappy Wi-Fi system and a computer room of only three computers, one of which never seemed to work, that seemed to have been taken over as a children's playground,"

We changed and went to our show, afterwards, walking back to Sofitel at 10PM, we were looking forward to room service as a nightcap. First of all, the room had no menues, or instructions on how to reach room service. When we did finally call the front desk, we were told the menu was on the TV...really...it would be nice if there was a card or something that informs a guest of that. Then we were informed room service ended at 10PM...thanks a lot...other hotels have room service at least intil midnight. The front desk couldnt care less...good move...youve lost loyal customers for life, and others who will read this you'll never know..."

This place is around the corner so we pick this one.They participate in the restaurant week but the restaurant week menu, similar to other restaurants, are pretty much over priced. We went with the regular one. Now the food:We shared grilled octopus as a starter. The ladies opted for the seared scallops and the gentlemen went with New York sirloin and bone-in ribeye. I didn't have any beef as I'm not a big fan. The octopus comes in with bacon and potatoes decorated around the main presentation. The sauce is a bit creamy and goes pretty well with the octopus itself."

They helped coordinate flowers, chocolate covered strawberries and wine to be delivered to my parents room during my mother's bday and they were so helpful with all of it that when it was delivered it was perfect!

704,P-qjkvDDyQprOWj1yV8ZYA,11/20/2019,4 star rating,Had a great time at Sofitel New York. I came as a wedding guest and the venue was set up well and the staff were well coordinated. The food was cooked well and the night went smoothly. I'll need to book a room one day to review that aspect but overall Sofitel had good service and friendly staff and that's a plus!
705,P-qjkvDDyQprOWj1yV8ZYA,9/2/2019,1 star rating,"The Sofitel may appear to be luxurious, but sadly, it's a facade. The staff certainly seems kind, but their actions are not genuine. I had a few problems with my reservation and interactions with the hotel staff.The first being that we had booked a room with a king bed. Upon arrival, they had downgraded us to a queen. We requested that if a room with the initial criteria was canceled by another guest that we be offered a room switch the following day. However, there was nothing available for the days to come... nonetheless, the problem persisted. The problem continued when I requested a roll away bed. They had said that New York law did not allow a roll away bed because of fire hazard laws and that a roll away would not fit in our room. Let me clarify, I had originally booked a room with a king sized bed, a roll away was only appropriate to accommodate the original agreement - but to no avail. I had hustled my way up to my room to assess whether or not a roll away could fit. As an engineer, it could have easily fit without blocking exits. Not to mention, I have stayed at other hotels that were able to accommodate the same request. That's not all ladies and gents!We had requested for one more comforter, as they had not changed our sheets nor our comforter while we were away. For a hotel of this standard, I expect my sheets to be changed and not to simply have my bed half made. Regardless, they had no extra comforters. How is that possible? You're trying to tell me that there are no extra comforters? How are they rotating the sheets when guests check out? Are they reusing the same ones without washing them? Seems to be unsanitary to me.With all of this said, if you aren't a millionaire or have a title with your name, then don't stay here. The staff will treat you like you're worthless."

Although we have one here in LA, I had never been. The customer service was great. Almost the entire staff spoke French which was definitely a vibe. During check in, they told us they were upgrading our room as a birthday gift and surprised us with complimentary champagne with macaroons. It was super sweet and thoughtful. We had a beautiful view of New York City from our room. The rooms were extremely clean and in excellent condition. If it is your first time visiting NYC, Times Square is literally a tourist trap. This hotel is 1-2 blocks away from Times Square. Close walking distance but far away enough to get away from all the tourist noise and chaos. I can't wait to go back!"

My only complaint is seems like whoever prepared it might have been a little to generous with salt but overall it was delicious!This place has a back room along with a spacious garden in which you can enjoy some of the beers they have for sale.

Personally, I'm just not a fan of kimchi or fries.I ordered online the avocado toast without cottage cheese. I am not a fan of it, never liked it, I don't like to eat dairy. I marked that I didn't want the cheese and I wrote in the memo that I didn't want the cheese. I noted if they can add tomato instead of the cheese, that would be great. What did I find on my toast? Cottage cheese. I was highly disappointed they totally ignored what I put down!Despite the cravings my friend gets, I will not be going back.

If you walk to the back, there's a beautiful study garden, filled with plants, with peaceful, no-lyric music playing. It's a student's dream; so serene feeling and easy to focus. The pictures do no justice. It also has both fans and heaters so that you can tune the temperature according to the day's weather. My only complaint is that there are no charging ports in the garden (you'll have to go inside) and the policy of no laptops after 5, but I understand that they want to change the environment to being a beer garden in the evenings.As far as the food, their chicken sandwich is AMAZING. Me and my friend don't even like dark meat but agreed that the sandwich is so good that we didn't even notice. The coffee, i'll be honest - it's mediocre and the place would benefit frommore flavor offerings, but the ambience makes up for it."

The space is sooo soo cute which is why I kept going back. It was such a relaxing environment - both the backyard and the outdoor seating near the sidewalk. It's quiet enough to do calls and cute enough to be a nice background during video calls. I will say though, the wifi could be better. Its always been very slow. The menu is really hit or miss. I think I've tried every OG item they've had. The coffee isn't the best. I think it's too watery. (I've tried the place they get the coffee beans from and it's delicious! In Brooklyn!) Bubble tea is okay. My favorite has always been the bee puffs and breakfast sandwich. They still taste delicious. I don't recommend the ham and cheese croissant, way too much cheese and ham. Also didn't like the pork buns. I liked them back when they first opened and used roast pork, but now that it's made with pork belly pieces, it's way too fatty. The prices have increased A LOT over the years and I can't justify going there anymore. Also, the laptop rule is inconvenient for those who work till 6pm or would like to unwind with a glass of wine and video call someone after work to talk about their day."

The caramelized onions were literally the best I have ever had in my life. They were browned to pure perfection, couldn't even recognize them. Standard sauteed shrooms and the burgers themselves were juicy but with a wonderful crust.Fried chicken sandwich was great. Got it for a family member and he appreciated it.Do note that they charge you 4 percent extra for using a card.

That might explain why my workouts werent all too effective... but anyway, it was a beautiful location, with exposed brick walls inside, an open (ish) kitchen, and old-school diner stools, it had a retro-burger-joint meets dive-bar vibe that was pretty awesome.Unfortunately, when Hurricane Sandy hit, his restaurant was destroyed - but in an incredible come-back, he ended up opening his Mill Basin food truck, Hard Times Sundaes, and went on to start a franchise.I was incredibly excited when I heard he was opening a new location that was closer to home, offering free burgers, fries, ice cream and egg creams for their grand opening - and obviously... I wasn't missing that!I was not dissapointed, one bite of that burger and I was brought right back to the good ol' days. I seldomly went to the truck as my co-worker normally brought me a burger, but it was usually the highlight of my day.My favorite menu item is the signature burger - a double with cheese, bacon, caramelized onions, and all the fixin's.I've been to the Dekalb Food Hall location as well - and they're delicious too, albeit a bit disorganized - but I'll get into that in a different review! :)"

Prior to going this past Sunday, my husband called to make reservations stating that it was our wedding anniversary and that we would like a nice table. The person who answered the phone, an older man, was rude and brushed him off. When we arrived, we noticed a nice six-seat table near the patio and asked if we could sit there. The restaurant was barely crowded but the maitre d (likely the same person who answered the phone) said we could not be seated there in case a party of 6 came. This would have been a reasonable response if it were a Friday or Saturday night, but at 3 PM on a Sunday afternoon? Not to mention, there were many empty tables... Our waiter was very unenthusiastic in his greeting. He stated the specials. We ordered baked clams as an appetizer. My mother ordered the halibut oreganata (on special), my aunt and husband ordered the prawns with saffron risotto (on special) and I ordered the linguine nero with seafood. Our clams arrived and for $15 they were shameful- overcooked to the point of being rubbery. A very rookie mistake. We did not say anything because the service was so disinterested, we did not think it would make a difference. We awaited our entrees with bated breath, but were extremely disappointed for the following reasons:1) My mother's halibut was so, so dry- it was beyond well done. There was insufficient sauce and lemon to redeem the fish. 2) The prawns were inconsistently cooked- some parts were dry and others were under-cooked.3) At NO point did any member of the staff come over to see how we were faring with our dishes. 4) My pasta dish was the best-tasting, but it was one note.The best part of the meal was dessert, namely the tartufo.

From the look of things I was expecting an enjoyable, yet pricey meal. The place seemed to be busy. To my surprise things seemed to take a turn for the worse.After we were seated we asked our server 3 times for a cocktail menu to start. He seemed to ignore us. As we sat and read the menu we ""enjoyed"" a basket of cold bread. To start we ordered appetizers. They seemed to be satisfying. We ordered the baked clams, oysters, calamari and octopus. Throughout the course of our dinner, I started to get irritated with the way the waiters were serving us. The server kept putting his arms over my shoulders and in my face in order to provide me with water and collect my plates. When he served me another clean plate he plopped it in front of me. It was very uncomfortable having someone on top of you with no etiquette.As we sat there waiting for our dinner, the table was a mess. I remember waiting a while for our food and saying to myself, it would be nice if someone came and cleaned up. Minutes later the server comes over, reaches over my shoulder and using his tool scrapes all the crumbs and junk in my lap and on my white shirt. I looked at him in complete SHOCK. Never have I ever dealt with a staff that was so careless and stupid.For dinner I ordered the veal martini. Needless to say when it came out it was paper thin, cold and overly drenched in lemon juice.Overall the service ruined my time, the food wasn't terrible.

I suggested we stop to have a drink and an appetizer. It was 9:25 (the restaurant closes at 10:00). I asked the Maitre d for a table, and he said they were closing. We said ""ok"" and were on our way out when we heard him say ""I don't allow people in tank tops in my restaurant"". First of all....he could just tell us that we were not wearing the appropriate dress code, and we would know for the next time. Second, the comment was clearly made for us to hear. I'm not sure who he was talking to, being that there were only two tables with patrons. We were wearing shorts and tank tops because we were getting exercise and the temperature was 90 degrees.  We just wanted to support a local, family run business during this hard economic time.I am not saying that I would not visit again.

I substituted the fried for veggies. ( sorry forgot to take pics). My lady friend ordered the Bronzino filet in a butter sauce. They had whole Bronzino as well.. I was shocked that they only had 4 fish dishes and they are located right on the harbor. Her fish was fishy tasting. That's a big red flag for me. Everything else was pretty good. We ordered a pear salad and sausage and broccoli rabe which was surprisingly good. Usually I find restaurant broccoli rabe to be bitter but this one was delicious. The salad was your average salad, nothing to write home about. Lastly the service was extremely attentive, clean, nice intimate setting and parking right out front. I found the prices slightly high but not that bad. Maybe I'm just being a cry baby like she said to me in the car."

It takes me 10 minutes just to complete a order for delivery over the phone.The food takes over an hour to be delivery and I live fairly close to this place! The service sucks.When I receive my food. The spoon and forks are always missing. They give you too much rice and a little size of meat(Chicken, Pork, beef, ect..) My food is always cold when it arrives!!Buying food from this place is like playing a game of Russian Rollet! This place kind of sucks! Get someone that knows English please!"

I ordered through Eat24 -- a lunch special which included white rice, red beans and a Sprite. I also ordered a slice of guava cake, one of my favorite desserts. First of all, they took forever delivering my food. Forty minutes to be exact. It's not like they have to cook anything, the food is already prepared. Second, the guy who brought the stuff wasn't even going to give me a receipt unless I asked. Then they gave me a bottle of water instead of the Sprite I requested. I called the restaurant to tell them they got it wrong and the woman on the phone told me they ran out, so they gave me water instead. How about calling the customer and telling them what else is available before making a decision on what they want to drink???Finally, these fools sent PINEAPPLE cake instead of the guava I paid for. That was the last straw. Called them back and told them about it -- ""We didn't have guava cake so we gave you pineapple instead."" SERIOUSLY??? And instead of being apologetic about the whole thing the two women I spoke with (one of whom claimed to be a supervisor) were rude and all they offered me were excuses. I called Eat24 and complained about them. The operator called the restaurant herself and told them next time they don't have an item in stock, please call the app so they can remove it from the menu. And she also made the manager give me a partial refund (for the Sprite and cake). I'll be keeping an eye on my bank account to ensure the money goes through. Otherwise I will be paying them a visit."

761,hayvcF_cFMSYa1Ha7PWbVw,3/20/2017,4 star rating,I recently ordered some takeout from China Glatt which is close to my workplace. The restaurant itself is clean and roomy.They have a massive takeout business and very good sushi and great crispy noodles and a delicious but strange pastrami egg roll.Their Chinese food dishes are very good especially for Kosher food.There wait service is very good and is responsive. The prices are quite high probably because the food is glatt kosher making the price to value ratio below average for this type of restaurant. It may help if there were more coupons available for this restaurant.All in all this was a very good experience and I look forward to returning in the near future.

Food: Let me give you an example: I ordered egg drop soup, it was good, not best I had but it was good. My Daughter ordered velvet Chicken Corn soup... she received Egg drop soup with ""canned"" corn and two pieces of chicken size of the quarter coin. No it was not corn soup :)Let me give you second example. I ordered chicken broccoli. I love Chicken Broccoli ! It was good, it was really good. Brown sauce wasn't best I ever had, frozen broccoli. I understand that... Chicken meat cooked good but for $20 I got hmmm Maybe 10 quarter coin size pieces of chicken AND NOW my wife ordered Happy Family dish... description said it is Chicken, Beef and Steak with hand selected vegetables. NO reason to not believe them, white clothed tables, very high prices if we are talking Chinese food... So she received: Same chicken broccoli as I with some extras: 2 slices of zukini, 3 slices of carrot, 2 baby corns and: 3 pieces of beef - size of the quarter coin... and ONE piece of steak that was size of the yes... you guessed a quarter coin :) My daughter, little girl... ordered Little Schnitzel.... French fries were probably cooked long long time before we ordered and reheated in the oil, Littel Schnitzel... 3 chicken Nuggets... like the ones that you buy in frozen section :) I would forget about my Fried Rice :) Hahahaha Fried Rice.... Some type of mixture that didn't look like rice, didn't taste like rice... I didn't find any vegetables or egg in my so called ""Fried Rice""I know ""Chinese"" food pretty well, I'm talking about the food sold as Chinese because it has of course nothing to do with China :) I visited probably all Chinese Restaurants on the East coast from north all the way to South Florida. This restaurant is not only a joke, but it is a rip off, waste of money and absolutely NO NO. They are also charging 15% tip without noticing you about it... of yes menu is telling you about on some random page, small font... tricky very tricky....Food: 3/10Service 4/10Prices 1/10Experience 3/10I do not recommend this place, prices are ridiculous, food is on the very poor level."

So be warned!I had a lot of fun at this bar, did not expect some inexpensive dive bar to be sitting around Midtown. We saw some pictures of this Harry Potter shot that had sparklers and were sold immediately. That was the first thing we ordered. Continue reading for spoilers... Don't ask me what was in the drink, I only remembered it was sweet and easy to drink, came with Hogwarts uniforms and wands, but didn't get any sparklers. Perhaps it's a big fire hazard with drunkies around.Well, why not continue the fun? They have a huge booklet of all the drinks available, listing out the base alcohol and whether it is a theatrical shot or not. Or you can just look up on the walls, they had them listed out. And so we tried out Hamilton shot (not gonna waste my shot! get it?) and a Pokemon shot. More easy to drink shots and lots of moments to scream and shout the lyrics like some karaoke bar. If you're not in the mood for some bougee rooftop bar and you're a huge musical fan, honestly what's stopping you from coming?"

But obviously you won't let yourself get that dizzy and pick a place for a decent bite. Here we have the Asian flavors one wants on a cold day, and what better to get than pho? Nothing! The noodles are silky smooth, which was perfect. The broth was alright, not as potent as I would like it. The deluxe version with the meats were average though, which was disappointing. I was hoping for the traditional slices of semi raw beef that you would get at the places in any Asian heavy neighborhood but eh, you'll take what you can get, right?"

There wasn't very much meat in the pho and you only select one cut. The broth was pretty good. The strawberry lychee smoothie was better and not too sweet. Seating is a bit of a mess when it's busy. It is a small place and seating is first come first serve. I went when there were no available seats and there is that awkwardness when a table finishes and there are multiple people waiting to find seating before ordering or with food in hand. Honestly, I would give it another shot for the chicken wings because they looked really good from another table and have to try their banh mi to be really sure. But would definitely try the other location. The staff seemed sparse and the ones that were there didn't seem to care too much to be there. There are also no bathrooms at this location."

A forth of my sandwich was missing meat entirely. At $13 plus $1 extra for choosing steak... please don't play with me like this. I also got vegetable rolls, and guess what? For $8 you can get (3) ""spring rolls"" which by their definition is a large piece of phyllo dough rolled tightly and deep fried. Was there anything inside the ""spring rolls""? Couldn't tell you.

I do not expect chinatown prices when I visit Vietnamese spots in other neighborhoods, that is completely unreasonable. However I DO absolutely expect Chinatown quality when you're charging me 15+ for a rice bowl that would be $8 on Baxter street.The first time I came here my tofu banh mi was good and bigggg so it was completely satisfactory. Unfortunately, I have since found out that the meat here is not seasoned D: I got the chicken rice bowl for a friend after vouching for this place off the strength of my first experience with the sandwich, and I was told it had no flavor! I don't eat meat but she was going to put it in the garbage so I tasted it to see if I could save it (I would rather eat the meat than throw it away) and agreed, there was not even salt on there. I managed to make some makeshift sauce out of coconut aminos and sweet chili sauce that I had in my pantry to save it lols.All in all two wheels is the best viet I've had on the upper east side and the food is not bad, but all of the Vietnamese food I've had elsewhere has been significantly more flavorful."

As other reviewers have mentioned, they serve fresh dishes that are very tasty. I tried the chicken Vietnamese crepe and lemongrass chicken banh mi. The crepe is kind of like a taco and comes with your choice of protein, bean sprouts, mesclun lettuce and herbs like cilantro. The amount of chicken was generous and it was well flavored. The banh mi sandwich was even better than the crepe. The baguette was very fresh, the daikon radish and carrots were nicely pickled, the chicken was piled high. There was also mayo, cucumber, cilantro and jalapeños on the sandwich. I'd definitely order it again. I'll be back at Two Wheels and hope you check it out as well!"

Most of the sandwiches revolve around chicken -- either grilled, with red sauce, with mustard, with vegetables or cheese, whatever. I've never been disappointed.The best sandwich is probably their sausage and peppers. They rarely have sausage, so I've only gotten this once.The sandwiches are always made quickly and the people doing so seem professional. However, they aren't the most accurate people to deal with. Something is always off. This isn't due to a language barrier. I honestly believe they don't give a f.u.c.k. about their jobs. You can ask for black olives, and the olives are green. A spinach wrap becomes a wheat wrap. That kind of bullshit. Whatever.The funny thing is that the prices are always different from time-to-time. This is strange, right?A sandwich and a bag of pretzels goes from between 8 to 9 dollars, the cents are probably randomly determined to how short the cashier is in his own pocket."

It was incredibly juicy and flavorful. And the cost?

So I end up eating breakfast at work, then having snacks later in the day.That leads me to finding good, reasonable breakfast options in the new neighborhood my company just moved to. There are plenty of delis around this area--a lot of those one-offs that are Guy & Gallard clones--where you'll pay silly prices for a buttered roll, and there are carts here and there, where the coffee is pretty much always shockingly awful. But then there's Bono's, which looks like hell, but it seems like they're always hopping. Four guys in the morning working quickly on the griddle. It's never crazy busy when I'm in there later in the morning, but it's clear there's a lot of turnover of food. The coffee's decent, an egg sandwich is the best price you'll get in several blocks around, and maybe just because I'm getting the same thing when I go in there, the prices have been consistent, unlike what other reviewers have mentioned. Best surprise is that their rolls are particularly good.Also I like that they arrange little faces out of bell pepper slices on their model pancakes in the deli case."

I came here with a friend and the wait time was 45 minutes. It was super busy, but this place is usually crowded.  Luckily, there were a few spots available at the bar. If not, we would have to wait a long time for a table. There were many bartenders working, thus service service was speedy. I popped in on a Saturday and they are serving brunch. I think it's a great place for brunch! I ordered the Smith Burger- cheddar, bacon shallot jam, crispy onions, house pickles, sauce, potato bun. It was a combination of sweet and savory.  I barely touch my salad though, I should have ordered the fries instead. The ambiance was great - trendy and calm. 5 stars."

However, the outdoor patio had some availability on a crisp, chilly morning. After being seated, I ordered coffee that was pretty strong for my liking (just me). For my breakfast entree, I selected the Simple Scramble with scrambled eggs, apple smoked bacon, home fries, and mixed greens. The dish was what I expected and satisfying. The greens lacked dressing so I left them. Otherwise, the bacon was crisp and tasty and home fries were good (wanted more than were served on my plate), and the eggs were well prepared. I like that the restaurant has many non-standard food options available along with drink (inc. alcoholic) selections. This makes for a great family breakfast!Allow me to add that the interior (in the back past the prep walk-through) is quite beautiful. I enjoyed observing the wood ceilings and elegant fixtures. The atmosphere was warm and friendly."

I didn't think it would be too bad for one because it was early enough but it was a 40 min wait. Now I know for next time.They have both seating inside and out. The inside has two separate large dining areas, and I was seated towards the back. It was packed, busy, and loud! My server came by very quick and was very attentive. I started with the burrata for an appetizer which was creamy and full of flavor with the tomatoes. It also came with the bread. For my meal I had the smith burger done medium and it was perfect. I ate half of the bun but the burger was great with the dressing and the onion pieces. The fries were small and thin cut. For dessert I splurged and had the s'mores cup which was the perfect finish to my meal. Overall the food was solid and the service was great. It was so loud I left with a headache after but definitely a good brunch spot for solo dining!"

I'm not going to lie, when I walked in I thought the place to be smaller than it actually is. They have outdoor seating with heaters a few tables in the front, and then a larger dining area in the back. They have bathrooms downstairs and a handicap restroom in the larger dining area. The food we ordered was *chef's kiss*. The black truffle arancini was absolutely divine, they were perfectly fried and melted in your mouth. I also really enjoyed the crispy sesame calamari. The citrus and avocado salad was also delicious. The pastas- rigatoni allá vodka and ricotta gnocchi were fantastic- I was tempted to take an order of each home with me. The deserts were also delicious. I liked the birthday cake but absolutely loved the sticky toffee pudding- I did not think I would even like the toffee pudding, but that was one of the best desserts I've had in a long time."

As soon as I voiced this to the representative by the name of Sidel or Sadel (the receipt is barely legible), she sucked her teeth, rolled her eyes, and preceded to voice out loud in the presence of 2 other employees ""I'm so tired of these damn people"" and slammed the window closed. When it was time for payment she lied about being able to use a coupon from the McDonald's app and snatched the phone and card angrily when it was presented. She then shoved the food angrily out the window and asked that we move up while our last min order was prepared. It took everything inside of me not to retaliate in the manner in which I was treated, I instead decided to vent my frustrations to the appropriate channel and I am hoping that something is done about this. McDonald's prides itself on bringing smiles to customers faces and providing great service. It is Management's responsibility to ensure quality services rendered and to make sure that customer needs are satisfied, I am quite certain that none of this is taking place at this location and I also believe that management is involved in the mistreatment of patrons. Had I been a terrible customer I could possibly see the need for this behavior and even then it would still be unacceptable! Clearly I'm not the only one who is disgusted by this and honestly something needs to be done. If McDonald's as a franchise cares in anyway, someone needs to be held responsible as this is not the first time."

I pull up to the last window and am asked AGAIN ""what was your order?"" Do you not communicate with each other? Why do I need to repeat myself three times? Oh and it gets better. I ordered an apple pie. After being asked 3 times what my order was the lady at the last window says ""we're out of apple pies so I gave you chocolate chip cookies""My response: ""But I ordered an apple pie""She says: ""well we don't have anymore that's why you got the cookies.""Me: ""I'm allergic to chocolate!!!!"" (FYI I'm not allergic, I just hate it with a passion!)She walks away and tells the manager ""give this lady the oatmeal cookies""The place isn't that big and you guys have microphones. If your out of something what sense does it make to have someone wait 15 mins on line only to find out your out of pies? And also, the drive thru is sooooo confusing! It has two entrances (when someone is hungry and impatient this could be an issue). Also the entrance on Kings Hwy has a bush blocking the view so you really can't see if there are any cars coming thru the Church Ave entrance. Overall: There's too many McDonalds to chose from. I won't be choosing this one again"

I put my order through on Yelp and walked over to pick it up. It was ready fairly quickly and I didn't have to wait long at all. I ordered the Dry Aged Beef Potstickers and the Incredible Har Gow dumplings. I was so excited but unfortunately was not impressed. I ended up sharing them with my friends who also did not like them. The dry aged beef Potstickers didn't even taste cooked. The meat was so mushy and soggy, and came with a weird smell. The the shrimp ones (har gow) had a strange smell also. Unfortunately, I wouldn't return."

There's something more glutinous, chewy, sourdoughy, almost translucent but thick at the same time... and the way it's fried makes it something I thought about hours after I ate it. We got the dry aged beef potstickers, the pork dumplings, the veggie dumplings, and 2 pork belly bao buns. Actually the five stars is also for the bao buns which were, as promised, really good. Really hard to eat daintily, but really good. The bun is so thicc it doesn't really fold so you kind of have to go in mini pizza instead of taco style. But the bite through the pork belly and the pillowy bun with all the juicy and crispy seasoning was one of the best bites I've had in a while. The pork dumplings were juicy and tangy sweet - piping hot. They and the dry aged beef potstickers were smaller than expected, maybe half or 3/4 the size of steamed dumplings you get at the usual Chinese spots and there were only five of them as opposed to the usual 6. It's usually 6 right? Easier number to share if you're sharing dumplings with someone. Actually hold on a sec... DEAR EAST WIND ... CHARGE MORE AND MAKE IT 6!!! Speaking of which these dumplings are more expensive than you are used to but the lady is there rolling out the dough and making them in front of the shop and the ingredients are definitely a pleasant change from what you are used to. Reading some of the other reviews here sounds like some people out there don't know how to handle a little stank on their meat which brings me to how subtly delicious the dry aged beef potstickers are. I wouldn't be surprised if I got one of them on a huge plate at one of those Michelin star tasting menu places. Anyway, while the meat dumplings are smaller than you expect, the veggie dumplings are larger. They are filled with fresh julienned vegetables and topped with a pleasant green sauce and crunchy sesame seed. I almost stopped by to grab another order of them the next day as a snack. Looking forward to spending a little extra money trying these special dumplings again, also looking forward to trying some of the bowls on the menu. Oh but before I sign off, I will say, if I weren't an ignorant white Chinese-food-lover I would deduct half a star in demanding dumpling sauce ... isn't there supposed to be special dumpling sauce? With these dumps you just get soy sauce and sriracha and the soy sauce is too salty and overpowers the dumps. Why no dumpling sauce with the soy and the vinegar and the oil and the garlic and whatever the heck else is in there? DEAR EAST WIND... I WILL PAY A DOLLAR EXTRA FOR A LITTLE TUB OF DUMPLING SAUCE TO GO WITH THESE FINE DUMPLINGS! Ok, That's all, I'll be back soon sauce or no sauce."

The potstickers were my favorite since the beef was bountiful and tasted fresh (which is funny because it is dry aged beef.) The soy sauce and hot sauce went great. I usually don't like bao but this was nice. I would order again. I will say this place is popular and only allows one person inside at a time so you may be waiting outside awkwardly with others while picking up/ordering."

The pork is juicy, beef is tasty, shrimp dumplings are my favorite and the sour plum drink is awesome! Would love to come back and try some of the main dishes on the menu.

Is it yummy: yes (although I am giving less stars because it isn't totally my favorite kind of food, but it is still good). Is it truly a ""snack shop"": yes - if you get a couple things, you could have a full meal here and share it with a friend or your grandma or brother or mother, but it isn't necessarily a spot to sit down and enjoy a meal together. A quick bite? Yes! If you LOVE Chinese food, you should like this place. If you are on the fence like me, you probably won't regret going, but I did go a second time and would definitely be fine if I never went back."
860,MlboKouxmGPxV2swgCh2AQ,9/7/2017,4 star rating,"Nicola's is a casual and unpretentious Italian restaurant that has the feel of family dining. Sizable restaurant with several tables that has not changed its ambiance since I have been going here in the last twenty years. I mean nothing has changed; no upgrades that I could notice since the 90's. Definitely an older crowd with loyal regular customers that the owners obviously cater to. The menu is small, specializing in Northern Italian food. Pastas are followed by short selections of sole and shellfish, chicken, and a longer list of veal's and chops. Their squid salad is very good among the appetizers, along with the Clams Casino; some of my favorites. The service is usually good, but this time it was a bit off probably because they were all adjusting to the busy season restarting. Our entrées were excellent as usual; Veal Milanese and the Shrimp Marinara was fresh and tender. Next time I will try the Stracciatella, an Italian egg-drop soup. I also will try the Pollo Scarpara as well. I have been here often and the food is always good, and plentiful. Mangiare as they say!"

It's like a trip back to the 1990s. You might feel the need to tuck in your shirt and wear a belt. The prices are high but there is value of you order well. I don't know why some dishes seem very generous and others not so much.  Good selection of specials. Ordered a red snapper livornese, which was $50 and enough for two people. Mussels entree was more than enough for $33. Both were delicious. Pasta special was spaghetti and meatballs. You get the idea. I would go back when I'm in the mood for this type of place and don't want to walk too far."

865,MlboKouxmGPxV2swgCh2AQ,2/13/2016,4 star rating,"First, the negatives, since that's what seems to be overrepresented on here: 1) it is expensive, 2) the service is not very good, 3) it is mostly old people (I don't really care about that, but seem people do). Those are all legitimate points that I really can't argue with.However, in my opinion, the food is good enough to overwhelm those negative. The chicken parm and eggplant parm are among my favorites in the city, and their red sauce is fantastic. I'm not a veal parm person, but people I trust love it. Many of their pastas are good too, but not quite to the same extent as those other dishes. I get the complaints, but if what you value most is food quality, I would definitely recommend Nicola's (and their sister restaurant, Parma, which is very similar, just slightly cheaper)."

The clams are not fresh and I've had indigestion all night.  My sister had the special halibut, $52 for crap! Overpriced and overrated. We would have been better off at Chipotle."

869,MlboKouxmGPxV2swgCh2AQ,8/6/2017,3 star rating,"An acquaintance wanted to go out for dinner and mentioned that one of his favorite places was Nicola's restaurant on East 84th Street. I haven't been to Nicola's since the mid 1970s when it was started by one of the original waiters from Elaine's, one of the most celebrity-infested restaurants of that era. I admit that this would not have been my first choice for dinner, but still, I was curious to see how the place had changed (or not) and I did have nice memories of being at the restaurant in its early days. Sorry--the restaurant doesn't seem to have changed at all other than the crowd being older. In fact, I would say that it seems to survive on regulars who have been going there for years. In terms of the meal, it's the kind of typical Northern Italian cuisine that would have been considered an alternative to red sauce Neapolitan most people were familiar with in 1975. I ordered the halibut, which was perfectly poached in wine sauce and topped with mushrooms. It was very good. It was fresh. The portion size was large. The pasta special, rigatoni also was excellent. So, it serves good food and caters to an older crowd. In terms of the physical restaurant, nothing seems to have changed since the 1970s. Based on aesthetics, there are many Italian restaurants on the upper East side that offer comparable food, many being less expensive, but having a more festive, brighter atmosphere. The culinary world has changed, Nicola's has not. It's good for what it is."

Our food took TWO HOURS to come out despite us having a reservation. They completely forgot an order at our table and that one took additional time. Also, they didn't even offer us a discount! Unreal.2. When the food came, it was ""ok,"" nothing special. It was overpriced for what it was.3. Only some people were bag checked and not all which was extremely strange. 4. Unlike other places in the city, they did not check that people had vaccine cards and yet had a large number of unmasked people everywhere. With this delta strain, it just didn't feel safe. 5. We were seated near the extremely loud and WORST DJ I have ever heard in my entire life. I mean we couldn't even hear each other when we tried to scream at each other loud. The DJ left me truly speechless- most horrific butchering of music I have ever lived. 6. The server didn't even know what a mocktail was and when asked for non-alcoholic drinks said they didn't have any. They're not hard to make and the restaurant gets to charge a good margin for them- makes no sense. They get one star from me although my friends asked if there was a 0 star option.

Not being able to eat out anymore, McDonalds is now our only quick and safest option. They recently renovated their entire restaurant. The drive thru has been expanded. The inside looks a lot cleaner overall (at least from the outside). They removed the mobile order waiting spots, so now you have to go through the drive thru even if you ordered from the app. I often use the app so that I can take my time getting everything in without leaving my house first. This also eliminates the need to deal with cash or having them touch my credit cards. In a time like this, you want to return home quickly and limit your outside social interactions as much as possible. Sadly, the staff is still slow to get things ready and I find myself sitting in the lot waiting another 10 minutes. They never look at the order details either, and I find myself missing all the sauces I had indicated. Things can definitely be more efficient and smoother but at a time like this, beggars can't be choosers.I just hope that they follow sanitary processes when handling the food.Stay safe everyone!"

We were given a total and drove around very carefully.We paid, waited and got our food.  As we drove down the street a took a bite of my sandwich and my tongue started feeling scratchy and numb as if I burned it.  As I chewed, there were hard little pieces of something in the food.  I opened the sandwich and saw there was two skinny pieces of dried up bacon in the sandwich!  I am allergic to pork!  We did a u-turn and I took them back inside. The window guy saw me and tried to hide away. Within that few minutes of me being there, I started feeling very ill.  The manager finally came over to me and I explained the situation (allergies, etc) and requested a Benadryl (she said she didn't have anything but a first aid kit?).  Instead of them apologizing, I was asked for my receipt and this little boy came and attempted to tell me what I said!  When I refuted and put him in his place, I excused myself to the restroom because the bite of food had taken its toll.  I guess she thought I was kidding because this manager had the nerve to opened the bathroom door and saw me hunched over the commode heaving and expelling my insides.  I came out got the remade sands and let the manager and the ill-mannered boy that the way this was handled was quite disrespectful, lacked in customer service and responsibility on their part.  The parting words from this woman? Make sure you check your food before you leave and sorry you got sick.  My words for the GM to this location is to fix the lights in the lot and on the menu board, its a safety hazard.  Train your employees to be responsible, professional and attentive to the customer's actual orders, not what they would eat themselves.  I will drive across Queens, go to LI or even to Manhattan where the employees value their customers and their health. My bf got me some Benadryl thank God, but I lost my voice and regular taste buds for 3 days.  Thanks a lot Arby's."
899,HOOnjWhiBJianjZ2YzBifA,11/13/2018,1 star rating,"I had a classic lamb gyro. The bread was unheated and stale, you had to bite so hard to break thru it. It was to be served warm and soft in texture. My friend had a brisket sandwich. The meat was 50% fat and looked like it was made by Dupont. Dreadful looking. The lamb was tasteless.Now contrast that to the TV commercials where everything looks great. They have the meat alright! But it's poor in quality.We protested and they exchanged the orders.They served my gyro with a soft warm bread. No problem with returning what you find lousy.Bottom Line: Courteous with the exchange process, but the food  is inferior. They apparently have no quality control. I would never go back."

But dont just think they are bakery shop, they offer some great selections of sandwich, food, snacks etc.Food: as always, I am here for dessert - eclair with nutella is great, and layered cakes are also good. I think they try to appeal large audience by making some unique flavors but you know, sometimes it is best to go with traditional one. I really recommend anything with Nutella.Service: caring and nice. They try to explain some desserts that are uniquely made in Italian fashion.Overall: 4 stars! COME SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESS"

Great if you just want to take home some pasties or relax and eat in their outdoor ""patio."" My only problem is that I want more...much more. You know it's good when friends in Astoria rave about it. You know it's great when they start coming in from Manhattan!! Try it - you'll love it!!"

Never once has anything that we've purchased here disappointed us. I don't think any other place can recreate the amazing cakes, pies and savory baked goods from here.

Their specialty is Neapolitan pastries and desserts and they are unique and exquisite. I went with Italians who said these were some of the best pastries they have had in NYC! The highlights were certainly the Sfogliatelle and Apollina Nutella, and we loved the Zupetta as well. The many folds of delicate pastry on the first two were incredible and the ricotta and Nutella fillings respectively were delicious. The Zupetta had a sweet custard with sour cherry in the middle. All the sweet flavors paired perfectly with a strong espresso. Here they also provide a small glass of water with your espresso too!There is plenty of outdoor seating, most covered, and the staff is friendly and fast.We were very tempted to get one of their focaccia pizza as well, a fresh baked square of cheesy goodness, but decided to just get sweets this time. We will be back for more pastries and the pizza as well!"

The treats are so delicious and are Napoletana. We tried the lemon cake, zuppetta, and I got a few strawberry jam cookies to go. They were SO good. Light and buttery with sticky, sweet strawberry jam in the middle. I wish I'd gotten a container full. I'm pretty much going to have to ask my friend to pick up some of these and bring for me from now on. Service was warm, personable and super friendly!"

It boiled down to the fact that it didn't taste good.Filet mignon: cooked to medium and from appearance looked perfect medium but it was dry and didn't taste good.  This was a complete miss.This is a beautiful place and would be great for appetizer and drinks.  However our entrees were not good and at this price point should have been much better"

Now to my review,The day started off great, we ordered apps and then our main course, one of the apps came but then they forgot to bring out the rest of the apps. We had to flag down our waiter who was barely paying attention to our table,  then after we consumed the apps, our food literally took almost 2 hours to come, when I got the steak which I ordered medium rare, not only was it NOT EVEN WARM and cooled medium well, super dry due to being too cooked, and the fries that it came with wasn't warm either,  Dessert took a long time as well, this whole dining experience took about 3 1/2 of our time, which is ridiculous because halfway through our meal, the place was more than half empty, *** if you want great view, Come and visit**But do not come here for service or great tasting food, it was mediocre at best, it was so disappointing that I wished we at at shake shack downstairs instead!"

The dress code is also really relaxed, but I personally wouldn't come here looking too casual (that's just me).The wine bar below is a nice place to stop by prior to or following a meal here.It's a regular spot that will stay in our arsenal for years to come."

The Hudson Yards space was very different. Much louder, DJ, nice view.Nice cocktail list and a decent liquor list. The good thing though is the food is the same and is very good. They have the best octopus in the city as an appetizer. Also the Milos special - zucchini chips with Tzatziki sauce is great. Excellent place for fish. I am not a dessert person so you will need to explore that for yourself."
915,lnrlmxRwXwx5pru2iPKx1w,12/29/2022,4 star rating,"My family and I enjoyed dining at Milos. All the food was delicious, especially the octopus, lamb chops, and fish. I do think it's worth noting that the tomato salad and baklava were a bit of a let down. The tomatoes did not feel super fresh and the baklava was super hard and inconsistent in sweet and spice distribution. Given the high prices of these items, I expected them to be a lot better. I went to another Greek restaurant in the city (and heard about other ones) that are cheaper, but give the same or even better food."
916,lnrlmxRwXwx5pru2iPKx1w,12/24/2022,4 star rating,"Been here twice in the last year, and both times they did not disappoint. The vibe is definitely pretty professional (not surprising given the proximity to all the offices in Hudson Yards). The Milos special is one of the best appetizers I've ever had - the eggplant is light and savory, and it's fun ripping into it to reveal the tzatziki in the middle.  The lobster pasta has a generous portion and is presented nicely (with the pasta heaped in between the lobster head and tail). Also really cool to see all the different fish on ice in their fish market. Hope to go again."
917,lnrlmxRwXwx5pru2iPKx1w,4/4/2023,1 star rating,"You walk into this beautiful restaurant with a great atmosphere. We sat down for a late lunch/ business meeting which was a 3:30pm reservation. They sat by the window with a view of the vessel which was fantastic. Immediately we were greeted by our server and asked about drinks. He came back a few minutes later to check on food orders and it was just down hill from there. He stated that their kitchen closes at 3:30-3:45 so we needed to hurry and get our orders in. We had a few people with dietary restrictions so we asked what could be done. Rather than making suggestions he told us what we were going to have. Which one of the things I told him I would not eat so I do not want that, but again insisted that was what he was going to bring, so I again told him nicely to do not bring that because I will not eat it. Through out the whole time we were they we felt the vibe of being rushed. Because we where there for business this was not the type of situation that was appropriate for us. Again and again they came back to the table pushing to see if we were done. Eventually a woman came over to the table which I am going to call either the manager or owner and told us we needed to finish up so they could set-up for dinner service. While my co-worker was still eating his lunch off his plate, literally taking a bite, someone took his plate out from in front of him. In total we were there for about an hour or less. I've worked in the restaurant business before and totally understand it's difficult when a customer comes in right before closing. But here is the thing, we called and made a reservation for 6 people at 3:30pm. If the kitchen closed at 3:30-3:45 and you could not accommodate our party then the reservation should not have been accepted. The fact that the reservation was accepted we should not be rushed through a meal and told that we need to finish up. Im not sure how long they expected a party of 6 to take having a meal but I can tell you at minimum an hour. The error was 100% on the restaurant and they should have taken ownership of this."

We were originally seated right in front of a large group that was being extremely loud, which bothered us a little but not enough to ask to switch seats, but the lovely waitresses offered to move us to the front where it was more quiet. We shared the wings with buffalo sauce - solid. I had the house burger and it was sadly on the blander side. The fries that came with was solid though. Maybe I didn't order the right thing. I'll come back and try something else because I do like the place! Also clean bathroom - huge plus."

The holiday decorations and friendly bartender created a welcoming environment and we ended up staying for longer than planned. It felt so homey to be surrounded by warm lights, good friends, and delicious food and drinks. I gotta say, the buffalo chicken wrap was so much better than most other wraps I have ever had. The chicken was crispy, but there was still plenty of spicy buffalo sauce. There was a good ratio of lettuce and tomato too. And it was wrapped so expertly that I could pick it up and put it down without fear of it falling apart, defying the laws of wrap physics! The fries were also, like, so good! Salty and fresh out the fryer. We ate every single one. We wanted to try the daily special lobster ravioli, but it was sold out so we pivoted to the penne vodka, which was fairly standard. I had such a lovely time here. It is in a convenient spot, just tucked away down Cliff Street. Pop in for a drink and a meal if you are around South Street Seaport."

That is, if we had a reservation.The only way to get in was bypassing the worker by the entrance, and with how popular this place was, there was a line. A number of us didn't have reservations, and while we were rejected the first time, check for reservations online as the times are different from the time they state!Our server was really courteous and always made sure to swing by our table to see if we needed anything, despite attending to so many others. Other than the service, there wasn't anything spectacular about the menu options or the food. The Mussels ($19) looked like a lot, but they were the smallest mussels I ever had. The sauce was so salty, although I did enjoy the complimentary bread to dip into the sauce.The Smoked Bacon Pizza ($25) was unfortunately the worst restaurant pizza I ever had. It was like eating plain cheesy bread, with some potatoes and dry thick bacon pieces splattered on. I'm surprised they told us we would have to wait 1 hour for seats at first, as many of the tables were empty for the rest of the night. The place was huge, with much dedication put into their storefront and interior than on their food."

It was easy to get to and within convenient walking distance from our hotel. The holiday decorations were really beautiful and welcoming. They offer private cabana-type tents outside if you do not want indoor dining. Unfortunately, our experience was subpar. Service was very slow and we found ourselves having to flag down and ask for help on several occasions including drink refills, questions about food, and getting the check. The server was very inattentive as well as all other staff in the place. The food was also just so-so and for a bill of over $200, we felt it was not worth it. We left disappointed."

Our server seemed very understaffed , as he seemed to be covering all of the outdoor seating area on his own. I had to ask 3 servers for a pitcher of water and it took over 10 minutes to Arrive. The food was not the best this time - ordered the ahi tuna nachos with the pork belly pizza. The nachos initially tasted ok but the guac was very brown and didn't look too fresh. The pork belly was rather dry - would not order that again. I'd be interested to try again as I've had fond memories at this restaurant pre Covid, it's a pity if quality has declined since"
943,G-QVCv1Lsz-15ZcjI7J2WA,7/28/2022,5 star rating,"Good thing we made reservations because the place filled up rather quickly despite just opening for the day (they open at 12). Our server checked in with us frequently and was pretty spot on with her recommendations. We shared:- Mussels (Crowd favorite! The sauce is especially great for dipping bread! If you enjoy mussels, definitely get this. Good portion size too!)- Ahi tuna nachos (Tasty! This dish has great flavor and the wontons were crispy, but it would've been even better with larger pieces of tuna... I scooped up more greens than tuna.)- Truffle potato curls (Great side dish for sharing. Loved that it was topped with herbs and romano cheese.)- Lamb lollipops (Good, esp. with the goat cheese, jam sauce, and pistachios, but they are definitely lollipop sized. You can finish each one in one or two bites. Also, there are only 3 pieces, so you will need to order more if you are sharing with more people.)- Beurremont Burrata (A very light, refreshing dish. It was fine, but not particularly memorable.)Drinks:- Frose (+$1 for strawberry, blueberry, or peach). Great for a hot summer day. Had the strawberry frose and loved that they used fresh strawberry puree.- Margarita (+$1 for strawberry, blueberry, or peach). Friends had the peach and strawberry margaritas. I tried a bit of the peach margarita and it was very strong. My friends felt sick after having 2 of them so be careful (could've also been the heat from hot, sunny weather lol).Great views (not right at the water's edge, but fairly close), good service, and good food!

Being the fat kid I was, well I wasn't even that fat in nursery, I was average. Even still, that was not enough for me. I asked for another ""fourth"" and they said no. So what do 4 year old kids do when they're not given what they want? They whine. So I whined, asking for one more piece. I was starving. It tasted amazing. I just wanted one more piece.

984,U9mM5NTEqiIFYJUZ69VX-w,4/12/2022,4 star rating,"Love it that there's a decent alternative to that other mexican grill named after a smoked jalapeño!  This chain is going places!  After the Yelp Elite Event introducing Hot Peppers in Astoria, I found out about this one in Springfield Gardens, which is way more convenient if you're driving.  If I don't drive into Astoria again, it will be too soon.  Anyhoo, turning onto Springfield Blvd from Union Tpke, we got a parking spot immediately, just past the store.  There are a lot of UberEats and GrubHub drivers coming to pick up here, so this is some good luck.  Otherwise, we'd have to drive around looking for a spot.At the order counter, you're presented with an overwhelming amount of choices, way more than you'll see at that other unnamed mexican grill.  All ingredients are prepared fresh.Choose your creation: bowl, burrito, tacos, nachos, quesadilla or saladBase options: fresh greens arcadian, mix romaine lettuce for saladbrown or cilantro lime rice with black or pinto beans for everything elseProteins: grilled chicken, chipotle honey chicken, steak, carne asada, spicy braised lamb or garlic butter shrimpVeggies: roasted vegetables, onion &  peppers, tofuSpreads & Dips: guacamole, spicy guac, creamy garlic, soy picante, tangy tomato, queso, spicy quesoToppings: tomato salsa, spicy salsa, verde salsa, corn salsa, shredded cheese, shredded romaine, sour cream, fresh cilantro, lime wedge, tortilla chipsSauces: chimichurri, mango verde, chipotle greek yogurt, lemon herb, pink vinaigretteYou can literally come up with a million different combinations and not eat the exact same thing twice in a row.  We've only tried the bowl up until now with slight variations in the ingredients, but once the bowl is loaded, you can easily feed 2 people or save the rest for lunch the next day."
985,U9mM5NTEqiIFYJUZ69VX-w,1/4/2023,1 star rating,What a freaking disappointment!  The staff is inept in putting a simple taco together.  The guac was brown instead of green!  They just slap the shit on! Too expensive for shitty service!  It doesn't deserve 1 star.  Had to choose it in order to post this!
986,U9mM5NTEqiIFYJUZ69VX-w,3/17/2023,2 star rating,I will start off with the food is pretty tasty. The service is normally fast. And the inside is quite nice. I'll continue with the parking is atrocious. Cars are double and triple parked out side on the street all times of the day. I don't know where they go because none of the business are even crowded. I believe it may be their Uber pick ups. On numerous occasions I have ordered a quesadilla which are usually delightful. You see I enjoy cheese very much so I request that they put their delicious queso directly into the quesadilla for an extra cheesy treat. The first time they obliged and it was decadent. The next few times they refused without a reasonable explanation by just saying it would be soggy or they cannot do it. I expressed my pleasure with a soggy quesadilla so long it had extra cheese but they still would not do it. I conceded even though in the same quesadilla is queso. What really upset me is they started to charge a fee on taking out food that is if you require a bag. This new practice makes it seem like they are trying to profit off of bags. The law does exempt them from charging the bag tax but they started this new practice I can only assume from the outrageous inflation we have been dealing with here. I just hope they don't lose sight of the customer service and quality to pinch literal Pennys from their customers.

Meaning you never know if they're actually going to have steak available, or if you're gonna get shredded chicken or grilled chicken pieces.

Food is good  with reasonable price but sadly, did not had a good experience on today's comeback.  I ordered online via their site. I placed my order hour and half before my requested time. I was thinking that I provided them enough heads-up. My order was for a family of 5, all burrito bowl only changing each one choices. Unfortunately, when I came in on my pick-up time, a mess just happened.  I said my name to the associate,  I was given  somebody else order, glad I  have this habit of checking. Then she looked up in her computer and confirmed that my order was not ready yet. She asked another co -worker to work on my order. I waited. It did not take long but noticed the rush in doing it so I was expecting an error. I asked the associate how will I identify each order. He has no answer  until I suggested to mark each pack. I don't understand how customers with group order identify each order. There  was an error again when I checked my ""new"" order. I was missing one order of chips. It was corrected but I did not hear any apology from the staff for the wait and for the mistake. When I get home and served to my family, three orders were missing the guacamole, then one order instead of black beans, had pinto beans instead. A good service is a big factor for any business success."

Although the bar offers a laid-back experience with hardwood floors, exposed brick, weathered wood bar, and golden glow of candlelight, I found it to be stuffy and boring.

They had a nice selection of tap beers, wines and cocktails. Beer & the house wine were the only happy hour items. However, when my sister and I asked if the prosecco was on the happy hour menu, the bartender said, ""No, but that's okay, do you want to try it?""The bartender made friendly conversation, relating to us in a way that made me feel as though I was in Chicago rather than NY where few people interact with people they don't know.

I ventured to the second room and downstairs the second time for the event and it was an old rustic-y feel with corks all over the ceiling!

Not a full-blown wine bar per se, though the choices were varied and decent. Had the rosé on tap, v pale Garnacha from Navarra and pretty tasty: rose petals, strawberry, good acidity. Did not make it to the other rooms, and a mellow happy hour crowd was in evidence, so I can't speak to other reviewers' comments about how packed it may get. A couple of French (hip) tourists and mostly laid-back 30ish locals.Simple offerings- food from 5-9pm (lite snax and 2 [v small] sandwiches,) 5 classic cocktails, 6 beers on tap and 8 bts, 16 wines. ""The Classic"" sammie was fresh and tasty. Like the funky reggae soundtrack. Good bartender (tho not super-well-versed in vino, but again, as it's not a true ""wine bar,"" whatever.

I went to this diner for brunch on 3/10 between 1:00pm-2:45pm. I sat down with my family , myself, my wife, and our 3 children, 10, 3 and 1 years old. I sat in a booth : when you enter , to the left when you walk in through the front door the booth all the way in the back by the window. I ordered my food and received 3 different plates with hair on it! (PLEASE RUN YOUR CAMERAS TO VERIFY MY STORY). Anyway, we found the 1st hair in my food so I sent it back, then we waited about 30 seconds (I was waiting for all the food to arrive so I could snap a photo for my Instagram post) and as we were waiting my 10year old sees ANOTHER hair (an eye lash to be specific) on his pancakes! So I call my waiter immediately and he comes and takes the food and then we start actively looking around and we found ANOTHER hair in my steak dish! (PLEASE RUN YOUR CAMERAS TO SEE THERE WAS NOOOO FOUL PLAY ON MY END). At this point we are disgusted! So I get up to speak to someone and they said they will replace the food (but my wife decided she doesn't want to stay and eat) because HONESTLY who would want to stay after finding 3 hairs?!!!!!!!"

No one at the front at first but within about just a minute I was greated by a singular server. This server was very polite and welcoming and seated us in a nice booth right by the window as it was pretty empty. We were obviously served immediately, genuinely one of the greatest and politest servers i've ever had. Even put on sports up on the TV and asked us what we wanted to watch because we were there alone. Overall great customer service."

The restaurant wasn't packed n there were 4 tables available on the side n 3 on the other. It was 2:30 in the afternoon. After we sat down the waitress came took our drinks and our food order. We already knew what we wanted after waiting so long. So fun husband and I was having a nice time talking when we realized it's been over 30 mins n no one came to check on us or even gotten the food. There were 2 couples who came in about 10 mins after us and had already gotten their meal. We had our 2 year old with us whom at this point was extremely hungry and cranky. We spoke to the manager it took another 20 minutes before we had gotten our meal. We order some chicken tenders and I ordered eggs and pancakes. I swear like they have to wait for the chicken to lay the egg. They were lucky we didn't make a big scene. But it's was a very TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.

The noodles are great. Salt, pepper and togarashi is on the side for seasoning! The noodles come unseasoned and youre supposed to season to taste ^_^ The seafood pancake is well worth the price as well. The portion is huge and it's loaded with seafood. They provide kimchi and radish as banchan and they refill it pretty quickly as soon as you're done with it. Utensils are on the side drawer of the table The menu is concise for the time being, but their food is comforting and well worth the price. Would recommend!"

The kimchi and radish kimchi compliments it so well. I haven't had any other dish here, but I have seen many people eat the jjajjangmyeun, which is the black bean noodles, which I might try next, since the people eating it seem very satisfied with it. The Naju Gomtang tastes authentic and is seasoned to perfection. So no real need to add anything extra when it's served to you, but it's there on the table just in case you want to add more. I like how the utensils are in the hidden drawer at every table. That's a nice touch.Would I recommend this place? 10 out of 10. If you're looking for an authentic Gomtang spot, I say this is it, hands down. Will definitely be back! :)"

1018,1RPmCa-HdxG-K5n-w2XY8w,10/8/2021,2 star rating,"Wow, this is a first.  I didn't expect to be gaslit at a Korean joint so soon after opening, and for the wrong reasons.  When it came to Korean comfort food, I stay away from the 'cue or any of their spicier concoctions - partly because my GI tract doesn't handle them well, but also because piling on spices disguise off-flavors.  I find joy in fresh ingredients and deep, rich flavors.  Comfort food like hottheok (crispy brown sugar filled pancakes), sujaebi (pasta soup served in a flavorful broth), or gukbap (soup served with rice and accompaniments on the side), which are simple but not easy to get right, which has a satisfying flavor without piling on the chiles.  The closest freshly made-to-order Hottheok is at Hodo Kwaja in Toronto's Koreatown.  Sujaebi is served at a few places in Auburndale - like Arirang or Daesung.  As for Gukbap, the only game in town is Paksanbal Baps - a beef bone soup served with meat, glass noodles, mushrooms and banchan on the side - spicy or non-spicy is your only choice out of a menu of exactly one item.  The ajimma there claimed a recipe passed down for at least 3 generations and at least 6 hours of prep time.  So, Naju Gomtang is here to try and give the little old lady at Parksanbal babs a run for her soup making money, but will it work?  Well, the menu says that the soup will be less milky (since no bones were used), and it's made for hours on end, possibly longer.  So there is a bit of a backstory with Naju Gomtang - Naju used to house a slaughterhouse for the Japanese colonizers of Korea.  The good cuts goes into cans for army rations, the pelts and hide were made into army boots and belts, the locals end up with whatever leftover, and just like any cherished food items born out of profound poverty, you try to make do with what you have.  Toss the crap bits into a constantly manned cauldron, then turn it into an never-ending soup - keep skimming the gamey fat off the top and throw the rice in to bulk the dish up.  Eventually the flavors meld and you got yourself a highly nutritious and deeply satisfying soup.  So according to a writeup done by Michelin (the Gourmand folks) - this was the origin of the soup.  And according to the menu itself, adding some spicy sour juice from the kimchi will enhance the flavor further.So when I got my serving of the Naju special (20 bucks) several things went through my head.  First, the cabbage and radish kimchi seems more sour than usual.  Then there is the soup, which tastes odd - the beefiness isn't quite there, and I distinctly caught something off-putting...sour notes and this anchovy-like flavor.  Considering that gomtang suppsed to use soup soy rather than sea salt for flavoring, I was wondering if their soup soy had some anchovy extract (which is used sometime in seafood sujebi soups), and why this tastes...a little bit fermented - like there is this funk on the broth.  Then I caught the passage on the menu about adding some pickle juice into the soup on the menu and an LED bulb went off in my head.  Adding some kimchi juice into the bowl did somehow made it  better - the sourness complemented the soup and it became much more palatable.  The older Korean family sitting near us seemed to enjoy theirs, slurping it down with serious aplomb.  Hmmm...if Naju Gomtang was supposed to originate from humble roots, then maybe it's supposed to have a slightly sour flavor, much like how Budae Jigae was a poverty food born out of spam and beans bartered from American military bases, combined with sour expired kimchi?  In that case, maybe it was supposed to taste like that.  But here's the thing.  During my research the Michelin article never talked about the slightly sour flavor profile, and the English language writeups of Naju style Gomtang restaurants in Seoul never mentioned it either.  So what the heck is going on?  Is it supposed to be this way?  Either ways I felt like I was being gaslit, and to be honest...you can add kimchi juice into the Park Sanbal gukbap and it'll taste much better.  I am not sure if I really enjoyed it even with the kimchi juice and I definitely did not without.  I didn't find it to my satisfaction.  The missus had the Jajangmyeon - she said it was okay but there are better examples out there.  The pajeon scallion pancake is actually a good one, crispy light and very well executed, but that's like going to Mickey D's, hating the burgers and only enjoying the fries...not a great reason to visit.  Daesung on 162nd also make an equally good pajeon.  Service is okay with their ajimmas and the restrooms are reasonably clean.  Credit cards are accepted.  Not sure if I'll return for another try, though."

The beef noodle soups were good but we thought they were overpriced.  The jajang myeon noodle dish wasn't good as my daughter was really disappointed since she usually loves this dish.  We tried it as well and we agreed with her.   We were expected several dishes of banchan but they only gave larger portions of kimchi and kimchi radish as we prefer to try several banchan instead.

Got the Special Gomtang and upon tasting the soup,  my appetite went away. I could clearly tell they didn't cook the boil the bones in the soup for a long time because it tasted watery. Seasoning was nowhere to be found so had to add a generous amount of salt, pepper, and gochugaru. At that point, the gochugaru and pepper made it edible. I think the customer demographic has changed, which in turn, changed the flavor of the soup to be less intense. Not coming back."

Ultra plush vintage sofas, lamps, drapes.... and Village-Esque low key vibes. We booked a reservation for a table so that we could relax our tired feet after dancing. We arrived a little after our reservation time and the woman I spoke to was very kind and accommodating. We collectively split the table rental of $100. We arrived and the bouncer was very attractive and kind. We met with  Kaina the bartender who led us to our table. Our couch was a little sunken so we switched to the crush velvet red vintage one. The art work here was super cool and sexy. Loved it. There was also a backyard patio garden. The DJ was great! I felt that he played a nice collection of 90's classics. My friend knew all the lyrics and it was like a blast back to our college days ! We enjoyed that. There was no dance floor so that kinda sucked but we knew it was a lounge and made use of the space around our couch.The only things this place is missing is more straight bachelors and a dance floor."

1036,OHnzI28Pd89TUhSs7tCDrQ,12/12/2019,2 star rating,I got a wrap from here it costs 8 dollars and they put barely any sauce and barely any avocado. If you advertise something with avocado I expect to see avocado in there. It also said it was grilled chicken but there was shotty cold roasted chicken inside. I will not be returning waste of money and not tasty

The Cobb Salad which is supposed include grilled chicken, avocado, tomatoes,hard boiled egg and greens, came full of greens without avocado and tomatoes. Chicken tasted most like boiled but definitely not grilled. Plus I added Gorgonzola cheese for another $2 and everything comes up to about $11 with so many things missing. And to deliver just a simple salad took them a hour. Never be back!"

So I check Grubhub for nearby breakfast places, and this place topped the list. $10 minimum, no delivery fee, it was a no brainer. But it seems like the real no brainer was the chef that doesn't know the difference between an omelette and scrambled eggs. I am baffled. I am disgusted. I've been bamboozled. But above all, I am hungry, so ima eat it. But these buffoons will never get another cent from me."

I continue to order here because the quality of their bagels and sandwiches is typically pretty good, but lately when I order when I receive my food it's cold or not what I expected! Today I placed an order at 11:30 my food did not arrive until 1 o'clock when I open my package it was the wrong sandwich, already mad that it took them over an hour to deliver my food I called the store, for them to do absolutely nothing for me because they insisted that whatever I ordered was in the bag!!! Nobody at the stores speaks fluent English so it is hard to understand them and for them to understand you, and when I asked for a refund they said they couldn't do it! All I wanted was to wake up and eat a bagel, now its hours later I still don't have what I ordered!"

Worst service (or lack thereof) I've ever had in my life.  I wish I could filter them off of my list of restaurants so that I don't make the same mistake of trying to order from them again.

They allow people to jump ahead in line and then make fun of you for saying something.  They still manage to give the line cutter his order (who didnt pay for it) before they give you yours, maybe because they all crossed  the same border.  They also can't package an order.  Clearly, they don't know light butter and pack a very greasy toasted, buttered bagel with all of my other items causing them to get greasy.  These morons are making $15/hr and can't handle a small bagel store.  I really haven't been here in a long time since they charged extra for pre packaged packettes of salad dressing that were always, but the better bagel store on avenue N had an enormous line and I was in a hurry..  Everyone's time is valuable morons.  And don't call me sweetheart as you're laughing and apologizing to me for my inconvenience, you dirtbags. Where's Trump?  Where's  the DOH?   Oh and their bagels aren't anything special and muffins are stale.  I should've walked out and left my order on the counter. If the bagels weren't for my children I would have.  I may have footed the bill for the line cutter too.They overcharged me on every item to cover the illegal's sandwich.  Where's management?"

Wish we were able to utilize the couch area in the back but I presume it was already reserved. Food was delicious. Loved the tartine and patte on the charcuterie plate. All the cheeses went well with our wine selection ($48 Merlot and $50 Cab Sav) and an overall great experience, seeing as we broke a glass and it wasn't a big deal. Sorry about that!"

Turks and Frogs is an adorable nautical/antique-themed wine bar. The front bar room is cozy without feeling claustrophobic and the back seating area is decorated with dark leather furniture. I can't remember which wine I ordered, but it was exactly what I was in the mood for; the bartenders really know their stuff! Another great West Village wine bar."

1049,6qx9qmfSte3wCUZ2Lqpmow,7/23/2019,1 star rating,"Wow the food here is complete trash. Wanted to get some drinks and a bite to eat, but it turns out that most of the food they serve comes from a can or out of a package. There's nothing more that I hate than Turkish/Mediterranean places offering stuffed grape leaves on a menu, only to have it come straight out of a can. In NYC this is unacceptable. All of our appetizers were garbage, the hummus was chunky, the pita bread tasted like it was out of a bag, and the babaganoush was mediocre at best. The romantic vibe of this place doesn't make up for the fact that the quality of food and drink here is abysmal. If you go here for a date night, don't order any food-- it's embarrassingly gross."

All I can say is this is the absolute perfect place for a romantic excursion - the soft light, the tasty wine, and close quarters help you forget you're in NYC and can make you feel that perhaps, maybe, you're in France in a little wine bar off on a side street.Take a date here. You're love it."

Turks and Frogs had a different layout than I imagined, but beyond the lively bar room there is a really comfortable back room that, despite the large group of drunk giggling women that entered conspiring to foil my date, is great for long, sprawling conversations. Luckily, their voices died down in my head the moment I ceased focusing on them.So, the people here are definitely cool, laid-back, and chill, which makes for a nice, Mediterranean vibe. When I walked in, they must not have noticed because no one ever welcomed me or offered a menu. I'm not fussy but it seemed odd. No matter, I like seating myself. We were then asked if we were waiting for our order and I slightly irritably implied that a menu would be nice. I mean, the place is small, so there aren't that many people to keep track of. A minute later, the dude came to get the menus, which was also kind of odd. I mostly found it amusing. We tried a bottle of the Turkish white (Emir from Çankaya). It was a decent, crisp, light-bodied white. Fairly innocuous and a nice quaffer, but not much to it. I was curious to try a Turkish white but I suspect the reds might be more interesting.Somehow I failed to register the music, but it must have been at least decent. Awesome place for a date or, apparently, for a gaggle of girls (in the back room)."

My roommates and I saw it and had to walk in after debating for almost an hour on where we should go. I was really happy that we stumbled upon Turks & Frogs. The staff recommended a delicious Rose which we ended up getting a bottle of and splitting it in 3 for a very reasonable price. We ended up sitting there sipping and talking for hours. Everyone who walked in seemed to enjoy themselves as well. A place filled with good vibes.

Some of the specials look gross like they've been sitting out all day but they do give you a ton of food when you order. Wraps have been decent but nothing special. Service is a hit or miss - most of the staff aren't too friendly and they nickel and dime you here for everything. For example, an extra side of sour cream is $1.50 for a tiny container, even if you opt to not have the salsa like comes with it and swap it for the sour cream. They very clearly advertise the chicken quesadillas with peppers and onions included inside but don't actually put peppers and onion inside and when you ask to actually get the peppers and onions they try to charge extra.... for something that's listed as an ingredient on the menu. Pay attention to what you pay for. I only come here because it's very convenient to my job location."

I discovered this place and it's one of my favorite places to go for lunch. Their hot food selection has a decent amount of variety, tastes good and includes the option of vegetables. It's almost like home cooked food that won't cost you an arm and a leg. My large plate of hot food (a protein and two sides) along with a drink usually runs me 13.00...and it's usually so much food that I have leftovers for dinner. Breakfast is good too. Only complaint is the smelly homeless dude that sits outside and begs for money. He smells so bad that I sometimes won't go here just to avoid gagging from his stink prior to eating."

A platter means just that-it comes with homefries and toast-it's never on my plate. I go there a couple times a week and it's always a different price for the same exact order. I asked why that is and the answer? Oh the other girl rings it up differently. I asked that girl the next day and her answer? The prices go up. I believe there is a big gap in communication as they always ask you to repeat your order 2-3 times and still get it wrong. Time to find a new spot."

I was a little disappointed that I wasn't able to use the 10% check-in offer and was told that it doesn't work anymore and should've been removed on Yelp.

The location is not too hard to find if you intend to look for it, otherwise you might just walk right by it! The shop itself is pretty small compared to the other dessert shops in the area- seats less than 20 I think! The tables are desks similar to what you'd use in schools which I think is super cute- the decor inside is very cutesy! As for the desserts, we tried their dessert with taro balls, grass jelly mixed fruit combos, mango pomelo combos- I checked in with yelp for a 10% discount which was great and they also offered me a free pudding because I spent over $30 (yay). I tried tried mango pomelo and one of the taro  dough ball dessert (cant recall what it was) but both were great. Very similar to the ones I've had from other spots. So overall, this is a great asian dessert spot and if I ever crave for any, this would be one of the places I'd consider going to. The only thing that bothered me a little was the wait time. I ordered 8 things and I guess they had just opened the shop not too long before I arrived but from the time I ordered to me walking out, took nearly 25 minutes. Cant tell if I was impatient or that is normal."

It gets really quiet at during close to their closing hrs as we were the only ones in the place.  Small but neat seating area.  We dine in and ordered the following to eat in:Mango and pomelo sago soup- was ok.  Too little mango and the sago were clumped together as it gave me a feeling of nit being fresh.  Durian Supreme- i think this was the most expensive desert on the menu at $9.95.  Was only ok for the price.  Not enough durian for the price and a scoop of black stick rice could've replaced for more durian.   We bought two other items to go for our friends:-passion fruit crepe cake- he says was good for $5 comparable to lady m.-durian pudding- came in a cute little plastic milk jar.  Wish it was glass though $3.  She said it was more of the milk taste and less of the durian taste.  All in all.  A better location for a late night desert run but why not go the extra mile for better quality and less expensive desert at Let's Desert on Bath Ave? Their durian soup is so tasty and half the price of this place even their mango sago soup was filled with fresh mangos!  Everyone go to Let's Desert instead!

However only because I've been ordering delivery from them so frequently due to their wide selection of bubble teas and cakes. By this point I've tried a fair amount of their mille crepe cakes, and can say they are quite good with a wide assortment of flavors. My favorites are probably the matcha and durian."

Made fresh, I got my Reuben with some fries and upstairs we went to take a load off and enjoy our afternoon deliciousness. To say that the sandwich was good is an understatement. It totally hit the spot.

1091,NVq6ZTNnQucOBNn5m6ubow,10/17/2016,4 star rating,One of my favorite diners I've been to. It's a little hole in the wall joint and the spacing is very limited. But I've never had an issue with seating and I usually come during Saturday or Sundays around noon.Service here is great and that alone makes this place five stars.  The waiting staff is very kind and attentive. The owner is usually behind the counter and is a pleasant person. I usually ask for a million things when I eat and after the food is served and the staff always comes through without any attitude.The food is pretty good quality for a diner as well. I usually get the chicken gyro with fries and the portions always leave me full when I walk out. Every time I've come the food quality has always been consistent which is a plus.Prices for the meals are so cheap too for a diner in the area. You can easily get a meal for two for about 20 dollars. I don't think that's a bad deal!I recommend this diner if you are just coming off the train or around the Bensonhurst area on weekend afternoon.

Live Jazz) without leaving the Bronx, but in comes a list of no's.The bartender was either having a bad day or just plain horrible sad to say. Additional Staff training is needed......so we attempted to order bottomless Bellinis with our brunch.....but inside of them telling us they ran out of ingredients they just brought us a horrible substitute of Peach Schnapps and Cranberry juice with I'm assuming club soda  Nasty!!!The upside the Live Jazz musicians were on point.As for the food it was just okay. Sidenote the menu options are strict to the timing of when you visit i.e. ...... No Dinner menu items etc during brunch hours.I had the CHARLIES STEAK & EGGS (over easy egg, fries, or house salad), my girl had the Pancake stack and had to ask for syrup (Why ?). The BRUSSELS SPROUTS simply coated in parmesan & lemon were decent.Suffice it to say we won't be coming back here anytime soon. Which is sad I was looking forward to adding another Bronx eatery to the arsenal and not always having to travel into Manhattan for a vibe. Oh well another time will yield a different experience."

It is flavorful like mexican corn, but you can taste mayo in it. The Fried Chicken Burger with egg was good, but it didn't settle right in my stomach all night. It left a bad after taste. The safe bet is to order the Salmon if anything. That was very good."

So when the spot in Fordham Bronx blasting horribly loud music, made my ear drums numb, we ran out ofd to downtown Bronx (3rd avenue bridge area). So while looking for the resturant we had in mind, we passed by this rest. and the smell of steaks (or may be hunger or the cold) we ditched our plans to goto the intended place and hop into this restaurant. Glad we did. It was an awesomely warm ambience (it was sickening cold outside) and hence very soothing to the skin along with the retro feel very relaxing to the mind (i dig exposed bricks walls- they have it)I got the fried chicken, which was crisp and juicy and fresh! Loved it! Drinks were good, but since i am late in reviewing (its not on the menu anymore) but it was whisky based, it was good that I had to order another. My date had pan seared salmon. We shared the food, bit let me tel you they had these garlic-y fries that were out of this world! I have recommended this place to many, and they all had positive reviews.

1105,o-xxl9iFJczUbJeZe3-pQw,10/15/2022,2 star rating,"Sometimes this is what hype gives you: a disappointing, overpriced brunch.Three things I look for in every brunch spot: venue/location, vibe, and food The venue/location is great, there's so much space and there's an indoor-outdoor option. However, when we got there, we were told the wait was 30 mins., Eventhough we saw there were available space inside and 2 vacant picnic tables outside. They have a separate kitchen and coffee bar, but when we asked if we may order coffee ahead, we were told that it'd take 15 mins. to have our drinks. But we still said yes, we waited outside until our table was ready.They brought in our coffee. I don't know how my friends (2 of them, there were 3 of us) think about their coffee but mine was ok. I wanted Iced Mocha with almond milk but the hostess/waitress said they don't have almond milk so I opted for regular milk instead. *When we saw the bill, they charge the espresso and chocolate separately. My drink was $9.50 ($6 for the espresso, $3.50 for the chocolate--- or the orher way around, can't remember exactly but it was $9.50 total for that one coffee order) ---which, btw, is still a bit overpriced even by New York City standard.The vibe:It's ok. Nothing exciting. The food:As someone who's been going to brunches for years and have tried different places across the city, their menu doesn't appeal to me as much. Nothing out of of the ordinary or new or creative. The menu itself isn't very straightforward. As someone who's not that much of a health nut I had to Google what ""warming and cleansing ayurvedic sprouted moong dal"" was or what ""biodynamic yoghurt"" is and its difference with regular yoghurt. Anyway, I opted for the ""third chakra""-- a plate of sliced avocado (which wasn't a very thinly sliced, 3slices), 2 eggs (which was burnt on the bottom), and mushy sweet potatoes with turmeric. It was a disappointment. I have had better plates of eggs and avocados for less than $25! And since I wanted some toast to go along my order, I asked for toast on the side --which, I found out upon getting our bill, was $5! This place is nothing but a disappointment. Don't waste your time giving into the hype. There are far better weekend brunch spots in Brooklyn with better tasting food, more creative menu, and cheaper."

After a 45-minute wait in the blistering sun, we quickly decided to go with the special plate including an assortment of slides. While we were looking forward to an elegant assortment of tapas, we were greeted with what looked like a thrown-together collection of leftovers.We had specifically asked for the egg dishes to be put on the side given my girlfriend's dietary preferences, and they appeared to intentionally put the egg salad and boiled egg right at the center to muddle the flavor of everything else. The cheeses and spreads were OK, but just about the worst value for money I've seen in New York.Despite this major goof, we were still charged $5.50 for extra toast when I asked if we could have ""one or two more slices"". This was certainly not made clear by the waitstaff.Conclusion: avoid."

1109,o-xxl9iFJczUbJeZe3-pQw,8/2/2022,1 star rating,Walked all the way here just to try and find this place feeling like an idiot. For autistic people I can't recommend because there are no instructions and no signs on how to find this place and you will end up wandering around. The phone number on google also doesn't work and the website is a joke itself. Literally just a website where it says that they don't even have a phone yet but you can send an email if you have problems. This is just rude and super discriminating towards people with different brains. I left and now that there is no suitable alternative for me as a neurodiverse person - I'm paying for an Uber to go to a different restaurant because I'm too drained. Really disappointing and devastating experience as a person who has autism. A simple street sign is all it takes but seems like you are to good for that.
1110,o-xxl9iFJczUbJeZe3-pQw,7/29/2019,4 star rating,"Getting to this gem of a cafe is a journey unto itself. Arriving at the address will only put you in front of a large lot in the middle of Bushwick's industrial cityscape. Creep down the strange driveway and you'll spy pink exhaust pipes poking out of a brick building. Once you enter the premises you'll be rewarded with a splash of pastel pink across the stacks of dishes and the espresso machine in the brightly lit space, long picnic tables covered with various tchochkes and the smell of fresh sourdough toast that accompany most dishes. The husband-wife owners take turns tending to their baby between taking orders and preparing food.The menu promises a veritable cornucopia of fresh greens no matter what you order, whether it be the ""Summer on Toast"" or one of the many sandwich boxes, each of which is accompanied with generous sides of sourdough toast, organic grass fed butter, organic avocado, and salad. I opted for the most Mediterranean of sandwich boxes, which came with large cubes of feta cheese, cold and creamy and perfect for spreading on the olive oil drizzled toast. Two wedges of fig take center stage, adding a fresh sweetness to the savory salad. Everything about this sandwich box- the olives, cheese, avocado, sprouts, tomato and even the lettuce- all screamed 'FRESH' and delighted the herbivore in me.For a more omnivore friendly meal you can order the sandwich box with smoked ham, which is heaped bountifully onto the plate and is the same pastel pink that is signature to the cafe. A dollop of dijon mustard punches up the ham, which is so tasty when combined with the crunchy cornichon pickles and salty marinated green olives. Somehow all the competing textures -- the creaminess of the avocado, the chewiness of the bread, and the crispness of all the vegetables- do not overwhelm the tastebuds. My beverage of choice was coconut water, served from the coconut husk itself.I have since read and heard the owners can be over zealous about allowing you to take photos inside the space. Kind of odd, considering how photogenic the place is, and how even former anti-photography chefs like David Chang have come around on Yelpers and IGers. That's their prerogative I guess? Seems like it's probably alienating some customers."

It smells: When you walk in there's an indescribable smell that knocks you off guard. It's a combination of food, chemicals and what smells like the byproduct of some sort of manufacturing. Isolation: Once you catch your bearings you'll notice a soul crushing amount of bulletproof plexiglass separating you from the workers. I don't know about you but I don't want to give a business my money if it thinks it's customers are violent thieves. It's just bad vibes. Scary people:As you're taking this all in you'll notice some scary human behavior, there is ALWAYS someone mentally I'll hanging out. I'll share my most recent experience: normal 20 something girl looked to her boyfriend when she was paying for their food. Across the restaurant he responds with a balled up wad of money that he throws AT HER. Not to her. As she picks it off the ground he says, ""here you go since that's all you care about"". He was not joking around. Wow. That is some anger. To try and shame her in front of others in the most depressing place in the world. First of all of you're going to accuse your lady of only liking you for your money maybe you should BUY HER KFC instead of just chipping in. And secondly you're at a disgusting and depressing KFC. Not some fancy restaurant. I doubt she's with you because you chip on $5 for a 10 piece. Other depressing things about this KFC. This is where the old ladies hide out to avoid getting robbed or hassled when waiting for the bus. If you see an old lady in the KFC Ask her what she's waiting for and then talk to her for a little bit. Make her feel safe. Other than Peaches hot house, this is the best fried chicken in the hood. Better than Popeyes or crown. The chinese joint is decent for fried chicken and they're super nice and appreciate your business so I'd rather support them. It's not as sad in there."

Also there's no flavored syrups :( Definition of pretentious Brooklyn hipster vibes It was weird. There was a tiny table in the back corner directly next to/behind the tiny laptop bench and I was like can I please just sit there and do my work just until I finish my coffee no one can even see me over there and they held a firm no. Not even any explanation why even tho I was like what is up with this rule ??? SO WEIRD LOL????"

It's not the establishment's fault that I was completely overwhelmed and stressed while drinking my chai, but that drink was unfortunately underwhelming and flavourless. The music is way too loud for me, so I experienced sensory overload and felt uncomfortable here. If the drink was yummy, I would get it again, but it wasn't, so I have no reason to ever return.  The additional star is for the kindness of the staff and the interior decoration."

I ordered: -tomato basil bisque-Thai crunch salad -avocado club egg rolls -garlic cream fettuccine with chicken Of course it taste better in the restaurant when it's fresh and hot since it was delivered and kind of far from my place. The tomato bisque was kind of salty and the garlic cream fettuccine was so dry, i couldn't even eat it after one bite. The Thai crunch was okay but the avocado club egg rolls was my favorite."

It was a Saturday evening so I understand it may have been a little chaotic but the restaurant didn't seem extremely busy. Regardless once seated, the experience was great. The waitress was attentive to our needs, Always asked if we needed anything, how the food was which is Nice. She introduced us to CPK Rewards which is a cool thing the restaurant does to gain points towards free food etc. The food itself was great I ordered the chicken Piccata, amazing flavor and well presented on the plate.

Overall, I really enjoyed the scene of Manhattan, and it was busy when we ate there.

Reason why I give them a 4 not a5 is for the curb side pick up. It is just a dumb idea. There is only one lane going in and out and for someone to stop and wait to get food backs up the entire road. People start to honk and the. You have to do a loop or two so you don't block traffic. Do not order curbside and they should get rid of it

1151,eOGMqI7T2hPN4CzFdyzmSg,12/1/2014,5 star rating,"My experience here was extraordinary, and it made for extremely happy guests, namely, one very happy young man celebrating his Bar Mitzvah. Located close to the grandeur of the corner of 5th and 59th, approximately 200 people attended the ceremony and after party at the Harmonie Club, ""One of New York's oldest and most prestigious private clubs"", from 10:30 through 5:30 on a Saturday afternoon. The entire event took place on various levels of the club, with the religious ceremony happening in the Main Dining Room on the 5th Floor, the cocktail hour taking place in the Harmonie Room on the 3rd Floor, and the after party taking place in the Ballroom Suite on the first floor. Each space was gorgeously appointed and, frankly, quite stunning. The Ballroom Suite, split into a main area with two salons, was perfect for catering to the needs of both the adults and kids. While the adults got the dining area, the kids got both salons, complete with a lounge area and a gaming area with blackjack tables and slot machines in line with the casino theme of this particular Bar Mitzvah after party. (Lucky kids!)The staff of the club was absolutely amazing! Not only were they on their game on virtually every level imaginable, most I encountered were very personable. During the after party, while dealing with the serving of salads, dinners, and desserts, my specific table's waitress was an absolute doll and conversed with us in a very genuine way. They helped guide us to different areas of the club when need be, mixed and served us drinks with professionalism, and made us all feel welcomed.As for the food, our cups runneth over! For this ceremony, there were stations for both kids and adults. Admittedly, a lot of the adults slid over to the kids area during the cocktail hour to snag a few of their delicious fried mac & cheese bites! It's not to say the tables of crudities, cheese, stir-fries, and made - to - order pasta plates weren't appreciated, but! Those fried mac & cheese bites were amazing! For the after party, we were served a delicious mozzarella salad with heirloom stewed tomatoes, artichoke hearts, grilled squash, and a pesto drizzle that was delectable. The mozzarella was fresh and soft, akin to a burrata. The beau and other guests at our table were actually glad two of our table guests never showed up; we may or may have not taken their salads and split them amongst ourselves. (Waste not, want not!) We had a choice of steak or salmon for a main course. Those who had the salmon loved it; I partook in the steak, which came out as a flavorful medium-rare fliet mignon with a small scoop of mashed potatoes, asparagus, and carrots. The plate was perfect throughout. For dessert, guests were all offered a plate of small cookies per table and a delicious individual apple tart with vanilla bean ice cream per guest, along with a choice of coffee or tea. I am unsure of what delicious items the kids got, but I did see an ice cream bar on their side of the dining area, which made me burn with jealously just a little. Ha! From start to finish, attending this event at the Harmonie Club was an honest to goodness treat. I doubt I'll ever return unless invited to another ceremony here, but at least many of us can share in memories of this wonderful day."

The only thing I will say is my tab was $5 because I only got one beer but the minimum on a card charge was $10 I believe. The bartenders were really nice though.One thing: this place does NOT have food BUT they let you bring in food from outside which is awesome because my friend ordered Domino's (I know I know) to the bar and we had a blast.I would definitely go back.

The Philly wrap is consisted of prime rib meat, provolone cheese, sautéed onions and sweet peppers on a whole wheat wrap. Within less then 10 minutes my sandwhich was ready and I was ready to eat!!

As a native Oklahoman and self proclaimed queso expert I am thrilled to have a national outlet for those moments when I can't get decent queso outside of the south. That said, the experience was disappointing. The queso itself was good enough to satiate that cheesy need. A tad spicy, and a bit less creamy than some. This is because they use real cheese. But a restaurant quality queso will still be smooth and not be velveta. But overall, not bad for a chain. Mostly I couldn't believe that at the chipotle test restaurant that they served chips that they may have picked up at the NYC dump. Some were so stale they were like chewing bricks. Some so soft it was like dipping queso with pasta noodles. I asked for a second bag and the unconcerned staff just handed out a second back of yesterday's leftovers. Poor form chipotle!"

The parmesan added some creaminess and cheesiness to top things off. I also added chashu pork for $3 and it was tender and delicious as well. All of this is to say that I was in umami heaven. This was well worth the $27 ($24 + $3 for the chashu pork). My only complaint was that there was only one piece of uni there. I also tried a regular ramen bowl with broth, which was tasty as well.It's kind of a small place but there is a nice interior with seating both inside and outside. The service speed was fast and our waitress was friendly and attentive.Overall, if you have any interest in noodles, you simply must try this dry noodle dish at Jun-Men Ramen Bar - might be the best noodle bowl you will get in NYC."

Great ramen optionsI had the uni mushroom ramen (which is dry / no broth) and it was beyond delicious - was incredibly impressed. They served a good portion (which felt needed given the $24 price tag) so I had left overs to take home as well.If you're a mushroom pasta lover - this hits all the right notes in the same way. Super umami and rich, definitely on the heavier side but it's a nice treat. I also tried the broth if my friend's pork bone ramen and it was legit - exactly what you would want/expect"

The ambience is cozy and an overall great restaurant to visit if you're looking for a homey, lowkey meal.My party and I arrived here after an exhausting leg day workout. We were famished and were met with a small, intimate setting that was Jun-Men Ramen Bar.In terms of the food, the pork bone ramen was your typical tonkotsu ramen in the city and got the job done. Simple as that. However, the real showstopper was their dry uni mushroom ramen served with uni, roasted pancetta, porcini butter, truffle oil, fried shallots, scallion, parmesan cheese. This was something I'd never tasted before and was packed with umami richness."

I got the spicy pork bone broth and as always, it's light unlike other pork broths which is why it's one of my favorites. My friends enjoyed their pork bone ramen and poke bowl as well.  We came in on a Friday evening, and there was no wait which was great. Waitress was also attentive.

But, the reason why I'm rating it so low is because the workers are just straight up rude. I love listening to music in a store, but if an employee can't even hear you and you need to raise your voice to get their attention is not okay. And for the employee to also catch an attitude with me was uncalled for. Legit all the customers waiting had no clue if their drinks were ready or not because NO one was able to hear a thing. I preordered my TWO drinks and it legit took 20-25 mins for me to receive my order when I got there. It wasn't even busy on top of that.

Not sure why the kitchen thought it was okay to send out a burger with such a small beef patty that it looked like it belonged in a slider. On top of that, it came with none of the ingredients listed in the menu, no lettuce, no tomato. Sent that back real quick. Drinks also took about 15-20 minutes to be brought to us, non alcoholic too, so they clearly just forgot about them.The biggest issue though is the service. It's really bad. I've given this spot a few tries hoping it will get better because the back patio really is a cute place to have food and drinks. But, no more. The servers seem lost and whenever I speak to them they never say anything back, like no communication. It's very odd...Waiters take forever to come around and check in, which they rarely do because they just disappear. Even basic things like napkins, water refills aren't done at all. You have to constantly ask and when you do all you get are blank stares. I worked in the food industry for years so I'm always sympathetic but this has happened too many times here and doesn't seem to have any sign of improvement. Seriously, folks, it's cute decor wise and all, but save yourself a headache from this food and terrible service. Go elsewhere. Or you know, go, and see for yourself"

Although it was drizzly, we opted to sit out back on their covered patio. It was cooler & very pleasant. Our server Randy was accommodating & boasted a friendly, positive personality. To start, I ordered an IPA I hadn't heard of before. I believe happy hour runs until 6 & all beers, (most?) wines & even the sangrias are $5. This is a great deal, especially given that several of the beers are upwards of $8 or $9 outside of happy hour. I had such a taste for sushi grade tuna, so I ordered the Grilled Sashimi Tuna Wrap with baby spinach, wasabi dressing, tomato & caramelized onions. It came with French fries, but I swapped them out for a fresh mixed greens salad (an upcharge of $1.50.) The tuna was cooked just as I requested--very rare, barely a sear! The wrap was well-prepared, delicious and substantial enough for me to take one half home for another meal. This dish really hit the mark for me! I can't speak more highly of Garden Café & would happily return."

I ordered the crazy salmon roll and my boyfriend got the eel roll and the avocado roll. Might I say this is some of the best sushi I've had in awhile and at a very affordable price. Sushi was sooo fresh and the fish were all so buttery and flavorful.Also got the vanilla tempura ice cream at the end and that was life changing. Such a good combo and it was the perfect amount of sweetness!! Definitely coming back again!

Originally I went with M.Y. for a post-climbing dinner and was pleasantly surprised by the 3 roll combo for 20 dollars. This combo also includes a soup or a salad.We then went back a few weeks later with N.S. and T.H. to have a quick and easy meal. The fish was still fresh, the service still lovely, and the food was still fast. On that visit, T.H. had the ramen which unfortunately was not super amazing especially considering there are some other, better Ramen shops in the area.So why only 4 stars? It's a pretty standard sushi bar with good quality fish but the rest of the menu still needs a little refinement. Will I keep coming while I live nearby? Of course! I love good fish at a great price."

The fantastic roll was a pretty large and had a hefty amount of topping. The spicy tuna is SPICY, but fresh. Philadelphia roll was okay but the cream cheese was a bit sweet to me. My other favorite item to go was the miso soup. It was a pretty large size which was nice, I was able to save some for leftovers. Will definitely be back!"

Second,  the rolls are packed with fish.  As in, most of the roll is seafood not rice.   Some places it's the opposite. Third, they seems to have a high standard for cleanliness.  I was going to post photos, but I couldn't put down my chopsticks to snap a pic."

Though the smell of the chicken is amazing, unfortunately the flavors aren't as mind blowing. I wouldn't say that this is my favorite place to get broiled chicken. The skin is a bit underwhelming and the meat itself is not as juicy as I'd like it. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. If you have be in the neighborhood often, this place is gold.

The pita was soft, there was a lot of food on the platter, and it was all decently good. Nothing to complain about, really. Additionally, the woman who helped us was very nice.

Pros:- It's still as delicious as I remember it being 15 years ago (the chicken and ribs, at least)! - The pita bread they serve with the meat tastes good. Cons:- The sides are just okay; the sides I had were nothing special. Unfactored Cons (didn't affect my rating): The prices are not great...but they are not (too) bad for the mid-east side Manhattan. The reason I didn't factor this into my rating is because they probably pay $1b per-month in rent and that's not really their fault."

It is sad because the food is a nice alternative but the service turns you off completely from this place. It seems to be a consistent complaint by customers. I always order items that I am charged extra for and consistently never get whether it be through delivery or pick up. If you add up all the money they have ""stolen"" it is a substantial amount. When I called during my last order that was missing $10 dollars worth of ""extras"" I was told just come back to the store and get it. That was the third time that week alone that it happened and that was their response. Several time I received the poke bowl with no dressing whatsoever even though I paid for extra dressing. If I wanted to eat plain lettuce I would make it at home.  Poor service turns you off completely!"

But then after all of the options it just got to be a bit much so we decided to ditch that and order açaí bowls. We did the build your own and it turned out pretty well. The peanut butter that I ordered in mine was a bit mealy. It tasted like it wasn't the best quality. The açaí itself was superb. It had no ice chunks in it. The mixture was blended perfectly. I really enjoyed it very much. The next time I will order almond butter instead of the peanut butter. Hopefully it's better quality. Other than that it was pretty great.

I refuse to continue to support a business that can't simply cater to their customers' needs and satisfaction. There's nothing worse than spending your hard earned money somewhere that makes its customer feel like crap.

It was this item on the menu that enticed me to come to Burger King since I haven't been to Burger King in over a decade. The experience is below par. It reminded me why fast food joints suck. Even with the impossible burger, I wouldn't go back. 1) On a balmy 80 degree evening, the AC wasn't working. It's really an unpleasant experience. The impossible choice of staying in a warm room with the smell of fried oil or a balmy New York Street in the summer with the smell of exhaust and semi-dry urine. We stayed in the Burger King and sweated the whole time we ate our meal. 2) The Impossible Whopper was not great. The Impossible patty was burned and bitter. I've had impossible meat at different places and Burger King has the worst preparation. In summary, I'm glad that Burger King has the Impossible Whopper on the menu, but the execution needs significant work."

Meat felt like it was cooked a while ago and just sitting in a warmer. I don't what starter they used for the sourdough but I didn't get any accents I expected. The onion did taste as if it was cut within the hour and the entire sandwich was wrapped well with my number on it. Once I walked in it took roughly 10 minutes for my order. None of the workers looked happy to be there and the guy next to me is eating a salad while killing a shake. Lots of tourists here but not too loud. It's pretty clean as well. Never see myself coming back unless I get another burger for a penny but I do hope these workers get compensated a couple dollars above minimum or Burger King should work on building a better morale.

1295,oo4y63gB623zySTadO1b9Q,6/21/2021,1 star rating,"Racism and anti blackness are alive and well in Brooklyn and this bar is a a part of the problem.I went to the Rosemont last night to celebrate a friend's birthday and within minutes of arriving and hopping on line, one of the unprofessional folks at the door made a complete scene. This happened after they went out of their way to randomly *yell* out to snap at us after listening in to a literal private conversation completely unrelated to the bar, and tell us that ""if we don't like it here, we should just get the f*ck out."" I'm not sure where this line of thinking came from, or what provoked this person, but the rest of the incident began when I, a black person, made a sarcastic comment about the irony of the person at the door going out of their way to treat a black folks poorly on Juneteenth. Is this person really employed to listen into peoples mundane private conversations and then threaten to throw them out? I guess so.Despite this persons threats to not let us into the bar, we ended up going in, ordering drinks, and then reconsidering after gathering the gravity of the prior incident. My (white) friend went out to confront the person working, at which point she was told that the person working was ""not a racist,"" and couldn't have done anything anti-black essentially because they aren't white. Sure. That's definitely how that works lol.Either way, the owner of the establishment who was initially not present, came forward to tell us that we--and definitely not his own staff--were ""causing trouble and needed to leave."" As convenient of a narrative as that may be, if a customer indicates that they experienced prejudicial behavior from staff at your establishment and your first instinct, especially as a white person, is to blame the customer, you're doing a bad job.The other person at the door yelled after us after we left to, ""go to another bar like Three Dollar Bill or something!"" And, they're right. Go to a bar that isn't racist! Spend your money elsewhere. As folks in previous reviews have said: the actions that this spot has taken are not indicative of an establishment that is likely to change. The bar owner is more committed to protecting problematic staff members than making black people feel safe and welcome in the establishment. We ended up going to Metropolitan instead and did not encounter any problematic behavior from the staff, and also appreciated the pro-black statements made there during the drag show."

Interesting mix crowd here everyone from gay men to boho chick ladies to the hipsters of the area always like a place with a good mix crowd.

Late happy hour specials is what brought us here goes till 9pm we got some Blue Point beer nice & cold can't go wrong for $5 dollars not bad at all, The bartender she was nice & attentive.We enjoyed a few drinks, very chill place good vibe & as long as the happy hour goes late worth the try."

Two weeks ago, I was a victim of a hate crime at the venue that my friends and I frequent pretty often.I was hanging out in the back patio on my birthday while a bucket of urine was thrown across the privacy fence. Multiple workers of the club including the bouncer expressed that this wasn't the first time that this has occurred. Coming from Orlando and the Pulse incident I believed Rosemont was not only a safe space but one that cared about their patrons.Getting in contact with the owner of the club after filing a police report that night was a hurdle as they responded to me two weeks later. Being that this has happened before, I highly advise everyone especially my fellow LGBTQ+ family, to NOT participate in the narrative that is The Rosemont. It's honestly disgusting that an establishment can be aware of things like this happening within our community but do nothing to hinder it from repeating itself in the future."

Remember that as that could be critical.A Vernon Blvd / LIC staple of a petite French bistro, Tournesol is a cute spot you gotta pay a visit...if not just to see their iconic mini-car parked out in front!While, some may think that French cuisine is inherently heavy, Tournesol offers out an array of dishes for any appetite and/or 'food-guilt' tolerance. From steak frites to several seared and roasted fish dishes, and an assortment of dessert, there's really something for everyone, which is generally an impressive feat, but noteable here with a pretty concise and managable menu.Kind of surprised I didn't review Tournesol yet, but recent went for dinner while my folks were in town. They have both indoor and outdoor seating - this time we opted for indoor as it was still kind of early and not too too busy. For apps, we got:Sauteed snails with tarragon sauce - these were great! if anyone's iffy about escargot, this dish will change your mind!Salmon tartare with avocado and grapefruit - really smart concept of cutting the rich tartare with the acidic grapefruit, works nicely!Homemade terrine of duck liver with fig chutney - we're a family that likes their liver (could be genetic/ethnic) lol, and this was pretty delightful.Aaaaand for the mains, my folks got the Pan Seared Skate A L'Arrabiata and Pomme Anna, the Seared Trout A La Meuniere with Almonds, and I opted for the Roasted Hake with Asparagus and Gaspacho. All really well-prepared, light dishes (which we kind of keep an eye out for, gotta justify dessert!)...everyone was mooore than content. I've also had the mussels in previous visits, and those are damn good too!But why stop there when we can have dessert?! The profiteroles and the creme brulee are definitely crowd pleasers!I was a bit concerned during the pandemic lockdown that we may have lost Tournesol, but suuuuuper glad they made it through...just a great local spot."

1305,4ruGQrxkRfZSFkrCSrJYSw,10/6/2022,1 star rating,"My husband & I came to this restaurant about a year ago when indoor dining had just reopened since COVID & we remembered it overall being a positive experience. The woman who served us was kind, welcoming & overall provided good service.However, I was disappointed by our experience this time around, about a year later. As Asian Americans, the judgment & prejudice we experienced was pretty apparent this time & I feel nothing but offended & disappointment that I had spent my money to be treated this way.My husband & I had wanted to go out to enjoy the nice weather after it had rained for the past few days. The moment we stepped in & were shown where we could sit, I sensed snootiness & judgment from the owner/manager. He didn't even say anything to us & just gestured a couple of tables where we could sit.When I ordered the hanger steak & fries entree, he proceeded to ask, ""What sauce?"" Being that I wasn't sure what he was referring to, I asked if he was referring to the fries, to which my husband jumped in to  choose a sauce for the steak for me (he's more familiar with French cuisine than I am). I felt even more judged by the owner/manager - as if I was an idiot for not being familiar with French cuisine, that they utilize sauces for their steak. (I'm sorry...?) He could have given me more context (ie. ""What sauce would you like for your steak?"") or even given me the options. The sauce options weren't even printed on the menu (or at least not in English). It honestly felt as if he already knew that I wouldn't know what he was talking about & he had set me up for that. A group of French young adults arrived later & were seated beside us. The owner/manager's attitude towards them was COMPLETELY different. He even listed out the specials to them. He didn't list any of the specials to us, nor did he offer us bread when other tables were provided with it immediately. Overall, it was hard for me to enjoy our time there during our meal. I couldn't help but notice how differently we were being treated because of our looks - because we aren't French. He never came to check on us, didn't ever ask if we needed anything, how we were doing, but was attentive to other customers who clearly, were not people of color.It's sad that you pay money & provide people business to be treated this way. I'm sure many of us can relate to working with clientele - it's not easy, but it's also not that hard to not be a jerk to the people you're serving. I'm wondering why my experience last year was so different? Perhaps it was because they had just reopened indoor dining since COVID & wanted to ensure good business? Who knows, nevertheless, we won't be coming back here ever again.Not to mention, the steak was terrible. I asked for medium rare & it was burnt & it came sliced. That means they weren't sure how it had been cooked so they had to cut it open to check. What's the point of even cutting it when you can see from the outside that it's already been burnt?"

We got the noodles, string beans with chicken, orange chicken, and teriyaki chicken. The food was just ok and did not have the authentic Chinese flavor that I am used to. In addition, the food is very oily and honestly does not taste that great. There are plenty of better options around especially since there are so many places in the food court. The teriyaki chicken was not juicy enough and the sauce was too sweet. As for the service and workers, they were not the most friendly. They were impatient when I asked about what the choices were since I could not identify all of them. However, they allowed me to sample the ones that I asked about, so that was nice. They seemed rushed to finish my order since it was pretty crowded and I felt that I could have received better service elsewhere."

I never tried this chain before and I really wanted to try something besides the usual Chipotle meals. The good thing about this place is that they let you sample their food, so it's good you get to try before you buy. I sampled one of the cashew shrimp and it was sooo delicious. I decided to get cashew shrimp with fried rice. The fried rice wasn't anything special. The meal was a little more than $10. The portions were small so it's not that filling. I later learned that you can order for pick up, which is what I should have done since I would have been able to use the YELP weekend coupon code. I might come back here again for the cashew shrimp though. Sooo good"

They have more traditional desserts with ingredients like red bean, actual tarp paste, mochi, boba, sesame balls, etc. If you like dessert on the sweeter side, you can't go wrong with the egg waffle pancake with icecream. The waffles are warm with crispy edges and the icecream is cool and rich. It's an amazing combo."
1326,eTEbLjRuIdXcMJLVMlaSBA,12/1/2022,3 star rating,"My sister and I passed by this Meet Fresh location a few weeks prior on our way to dinner, and since the two of us love Meet Fresh, we decided to stop by afterward and grab a little something. Unfortunately, our visit left much to be desired and we walked out feeling altogether quite unfulfilled.When we arrived, we ordered the Q Mochi which is advertised to come with 8 pieces of mochi (4 original flavored and 4 brown sugar-flavored), caramel sauce, and toasted coconut flakes. The process of placing our order was pretty smooth asides from the fact that the cashier seemed to struggle with scanning our barcode on the Meet Fresh app. After placing our order, we looked for a table (there were plenty since the establishment was completely empty) before hearing our order being called at the counter. When my sister went to retrieve our order at the counter, she noticed that it didn't look quite right--she knew since it was different from what was pictured on their menu and we had also ordered it previously at another Meet Fresh location--and asked the staff, ""Isn't there supposed to be some kind of sauce on this?"" Only then did the staff member say, ""We're out of sauce."" The end. No ""We're sorry, but we're all out of caramel sauce,"" but just ""We're out of sauce."" I mean, do the staff not do inventory? Had we been told earlier, perhaps we just might have ordered something else.Not to make a big deal out of it, but without the sauce, and the toasted coconut flakes, the mochi wasn't all that good. The texture was there, and the brown sugar mochi tasted slightly better than the original flavored mochi since there was a subtle sweetness from the brown sugar, but again, it was pretty underwhelming.TL;DR: Definitely not a location I'd recommend to others."

The creamer didn't add any flavor to it, would have preferred to pair it with condensed milk which I would think would taste much better. However, it was still good and I enjoyed the grass jelly shaved ice, it was sweet. Total cost was about $20.

We always get the same thing, because it's our favorite thing. This bowl was perfect for a hot day, and comes with half grass jelly ice and regular grass jelly too. It is refreshing, has a Jello-like texture, and not too sweet. It is topped with taro balls, sweet potatoes taro balls, and red bean. Meet Fresh's taro balls are probably my favorite. They are super chewy, amazing texture, literally bounces right back when you chew it. This applies to the sweet potatoes taro balls too, but there's taro filling inside. I love that combo, and a must try if you haven't done so. Red bean is a great add-on to this dish. It is on the sweeter side, but added a good kick to the icy grass jelly bowl. Overall, this place never disappoint, and we enjoyed it each time. Ambiance: 4/5 - Located in the East Village, just a couple of blocks away from St. Marks. They offer indoor seating with enough tables and counter spaces, but packed most of the time, and there's outdoor seating too. The interior is clean and well-designed with Chinese music in the background. A great spot for some good Taiwanese desserts with friends. Indeed a busy, but fun atmosphere and vibe. Price: 3.75/5 - Price are on the pricier side. We decided to make our own ice grass jelly bowl with taro balls, and added some sweet potatoes taro balls and red bean. The total came up to be around $12. My sister always get Meet Fresh when she visit NYC, so I guess its worth the price, since she always crave for it, the quality is there, and we enjoyed it a lot. Service: 4/5 - Nothing stands out too much with their service. The staffs are nice and friendly, took our order fairly quick and gave us a buzzer after we paid. You pick up your order with the buzzer or sometimes they bring it to you, all depending if it's busy at that time. We do need to clean up after ourselves and put the dishes in the cleaning station. BLUF: One of the best spots in Manhattan for some Taiwanese desserts and treats. They got an extensive menu, ranging from their signature bowls, shaved ice, milk tea, and other desserts.

Like all other Maman locations, the décor here is beautiful, sort of rustic French provincial.  The shop, from the inside and front, is very aesthetically pleasing.  I've been to several other Maman locations and have found that the food offered, from the pastries to the salads and sandwiches are usually a match to the décor, both in presentation and taste.  Their Chocolate Chunk cookie is well known and is on Oprah's Favorites list.  So, you know I was excited to stop by.I hurried after work to grab something but unfortunately was a little too late.  I got there about 45 minutes before closing and all of their pastries were already gone.  Bummer.  Only drinks were available for purchase at that point.  I ended up just grabbing a honey lavender latte instead.  Was the drink good?  Yes, it was excellent.  I loved the slight aroma of lavender with the smooth but strong latte flavor.   It would have been hundred times better if I had one of their pastries to go with it though.  Luckily, I work near this neighborhood and I'm already planning on coming by another day.Another thing I wanted to note is that they are donating 100% of the proceeds from today to Ukranian families via Welcome Baby.  The money raised is used to fund baby packages and will be sent to the Ukraine and Poland. This kind of philanthropy is something that Maman has been doing since the beginning of the pandemic; they've been donating the proceeds from the first day of each new store from the past two years to charity.  How can you not want to support a business like this?"

Eat an entire one and you'll be satisfied but not incapacitated.I've enjoyed all the flavors I've tried so far (brown butter coconut, white chocolate pretzel, white chocolate rose and nutty chocolate chip), even if I haven't yet been totally blown away.

I have a Colombian bakery two blocks away from me and I refuse to go there cause their bunuelos can't touch Rico Pan.With so much surrounding this bakery, even if you didn't want to go out of your way for it, something you're doing is going to bring you in this direction.

Their baked empanadas are fantastic. It's more like a flaky texture. They have spinach and cheese and beef with egg and maybe chicken? I don't remember. A bit on the pricey side as far as empanadas go but they are well portioned on the inside. The tres leches cake is great too. Lots of milk on the bed of the bake. Best way to describe it is like a saturation of a chinese sponge cake. The creme tasted almost we and not too sweet in an overall taste. Nice and cinammonny. I still prefer the one at the canateles on 78th and Roosevelt I think it is but this is good too for a desert. Balvin was here once in a food tour with action bronsen here I believe as well.

Stopped in here to pick up some Empanadas to bring home for a no-brainer dinner after using up all my energy eating myself stupid in Queens.  The staff was super sweet and helpful, and it was just the sort of understated, Mom & Pop type spot I tend to root for.  Thus, I really hate to uh, Pan it, yet so it goes:  Got a mix of Chicken and Beef Empanadas; both baked and fried.  The fried ones were greasy and the filling for the beef ones was off-puttingly mushy for lack of a better way to describe it.  The Chicken filling had some texture, so I preferred that, but it was nothing I'd hurry back to eat again.   Hubby tried the Baked Empanadas and was similarly disenchanted.  On impulse, I'd grabbed a link of Chorizo, which comes with your choice of a tiny Arepa or a Boiled Potato.  The Chorizo itself was bland and dry, and the Arepa that I'd chosen wasn't any better.  If you're intent on trying this, you should definitely go with the Potato accompaniment.Also got a Bunuelo, which I reheated and tried the next day.  Now I have never eaten one of these, but I expected it to be similar to my newfound carby crush, Brazilian Pao de Queijo.  Alas, it was much heavier and on the bland side.  Maybe this is the way these are traditionally made, but I wasn't a fan.The aforementioned sweet counter ladies sent me home with numerous containers of housemade hot sauce.  It had a vinegary kick that turned out to be the only real bright spot, foodwise, of this whole experience.  Be sure to ask for some if it's not offered.Ultimately, the food here filled me up alright.  With a deep sense of regret.  Up until this point, I'd enjoyed a day of utter deliciousness and was saddened to end it this way. Three stars, but only because I feel like I'm not familiar enough with this cuisine to justify being overly critical.:("

Admittedly, I found out about this place because I saw it featured on the Instagram stories of J Balvin and Action Bronson (I guess they filmed a segment of Action's show here?) and I assumed it had to be a good Colombian bakery. The bakery is small and appears to do a. Eey good trade. It was busy on Saturday around 1:30pm. The older woman who served us was very lovely and did not rush us at all while we decided what to have. I only heard Spanish being spoken but if you're a non speaker don't be put off from coming as all the staff were friendly to everyone. We purchased chicken and beef empanadas, chorizo and buñuelos. The chorizo. Freaking delicious. It wasn't overly oily at all but full of flavor. The buñuelos we're fluffy and slightly sweet. Delicious. The empanadas though, probably some of the best I have ever had. Don't forget the aji!"
1348,ty5KbGZXQlqbiK1KXWn3EQ,8/21/2017,5 star rating,"Sometimes, the universe aligns everything for you. I had been dreaming of pandebono (literally. My massive craving managed to manifest itself in my dream), was visiting a friend in Woodside, turned a corner and found Rico Pan. There was a pretty decent line that made it seem just popular enough with the locals. I came for the pandebono and fell in love with the buñuelos instead. As every review of the buñuelo says: it's lightly crisped on the outside and soft on the inside. It's neither too dense nor too sweet on the inside, with just the right hint of cheese. It's absolutely delicious. So what's the difference between the pandebono and buñuelo? In my super non-Colombian and layman way of describing it, aside from the physical characteristics (the buñuelo is a ball and the pandebono is a flatter, denser, cheesy bread), the buñuelo is sweet and the pandebono is savory. They are both delicious. What's great about Rico Pan (and the few Colombian bakeries I've been to), is that despite how busy they may be, they've never been nasty to me for asking a bunch of questions and have kindly pointed out what is what. So don't be intimidated if you're not Colombian or Hispanic, asking questions is how you learn. And get buñuelos."

1360,LR6nRVRoP0g_wqqlIE8Ynw,8/19/2022,5 star rating,"A small chicken shop with high tech. You walk in and order from a kiosk and just swipe your credit or debit card. They don't take cash, but you can use a separate kiosk to convert your cash into a cash filled card that you can swipe just like a credit or debit card.Now about the food. We had the MSG sandwich. a mega-crisp, huge buttermilk fried chicken breast, sweet chili dipped, with sweet soy mayo, sesame seeds, and scallions. It was delicious and sloppy. I will order pickup through the web next time and take it home where I can have a roll of Brawny towels by my side.  And you will need to wash your hands and face afterwards. They have flame broiled chicken with or without sides, bowls, chicken tenders and salads. All the chicken is brined for 24 hours resulting in a juicy chicken. I can vouch for that since I have been brining chicken and turkey for years. The prices are incredibly reasonable, and the staff is personable and will help you through the ordering process if you need it.  I will be back here to try the flame broiled chicken dishes. Go to their site and peruse the menu. If you're a chicken maven, you will definitely find something you like. The sides are interesting too. Not just fries, but items like charred broccoli, rice and roasted beets topped with goat cheese. Believe me, you can have this food for supper, and you will be sated without being poor. This is how chicken should be. I found Brine by googling Union Square restaurants, and they somehow included this one which is one 8th Avenue near 15th Street. Lucky me."

I really like signature thigh, broccoli and sweet potato meal. The name of this place implies that they will be great with chicken but they are also really good with the sides and that is just as important. It's a small place but there's usually plenty of seating and they also have outdoor seating for warmer weather. The staff here is usually very friendly and I also like the upbeat music, it's a great spot to grab lunch away from the office."

You order at the screen when you walk in. I ordered the asian flavored chicken sandwich and it was the best thing I had.  The chicken was the most moist fried chicken I have had on a sandwich. It puts all the other fast food chicken sandwiches to shame. Unfortunately, the original chicken tenders were nothing to shout home about. Pretty basic and didn't have the same moistness as the sandwich weird enough. It surprised me since you would think they would be able to nail chicken tenders.  I also tried the chicken salad sandwich and it was solid but you don't come here for chicken salad.  The sides didn't impress me too much. The spicy seasoned fries were not my thing. The spice mix was not balanced. It tasted weird. I had heard the sauces were good but I didn't particularly like any of them. They were on the spicier side but not for me. I do really like this place and I will be back. It is not the healthiest food but you don't come here for that. The fried chicken sandwich is the way to go."

Fried chicken, super savory and a nice sweet sauce on top, I wish it came with cheese. We also ordered the chili Seasoned fries and the broccoli. Extremely over seasoned... I love seasoned fries with extra seasoning... but seasoned to the point I could barely taste the fries. The broccoli toppings were nice, broccoli wasn't bad, too charred for my taste.Definitely will come back for the sandwich and to try other things on the menu. Highly suggest!

The only thing they could do better is package the food. A piece of bread was under the chicken and soaked it beet/coleslaw juice. Have enough chicken for lunch tomorrow. Will order again and maybe try different sides!

Vivi I find has more fruit flavors and dessert like options. Whereas other tea places focus on mixing up the base tea flavors with fruity options. Again, a fan of both but know what you're into before ordering. Just saying.I got the Thai Milk Tea on this visit, hot beverage for a brisk evening. It was really good, more on the sweeter side. It totally reminded me of a Thai Iced without ice. Yum.My sister and I frequent these establishments often and know what we like. Skip the chocolate choco or chocolate shake like drink, it's not quite it's name. Definitely not the Ice Cream parlor kind.Stick to the fruity Classics or any of the black or Green tea varieties. U can't go wrong with those."

With normal sugar it tastes just as delicious as I remember it to be :3. I had the 3Q BOGO thanks to the grand opening special. The herbal jelly, bubbles, and pudding were all bouncy, smooth, tasty & in just the right amounts. I can't wait to try their popcorn chicken in the future because that's the one thing KFT across the street doesn't have!The store itself is very cute and reminds me of a sanrio princess theme. Pinks and whites everywhere, with two seater tables and a bench by the entrance. Overall, the store itself is small and probably fits 20 people max. Hopefully with Vivis, competition can be fierce and lower bubble tea prices or spice up what each shop has to offer ;). PS no wifi"

(do I sound mean? ) Anyways, I saw how in Flushing the bubble tea places were numerous and then they started to come to Brooklyn - esp Bensonhurst.Anyways, decided to go to vivi's today since I wanted to get myself some bubble tea or drink (and I'm not a bubble tea person since I don't like tapioca and usually just go for fruit teas). I also wanted to get their popcorn chicken! (for my baby sis and myself). The drink I got was the Earl Grey Float (had no idea what it was but it seems interesting). So I ordered that and two orders of salt & pepper popcorn chicken. The orders came out pretty timely and didn't have to wait that long. My drink came out first and then the two orders did. The drink was pretty good - it wasn't sweet and thankfully it wasn't! Another reason I don't drink bubble tea or w/e is that they tend to make it sweet - catering to the younger individuals. But I guess cause it's Earl Grey that's why?it wasn't sweet. Either way - it wasn't sweet or too sweet and the form was said to be steamed milk but it tasted like they put something else as well. I don't know what it was but my sister liked that part. I didn't dislike it - since I can see myself ordering this drink again. Again super happy it wasn't sweet - maybe next time I'll try the Jasmine tea float. For the popcorn chicken!  Again, happy they did it right! It wasn't dry and tasted like how it was supposed to. It was piping hot when we got it and it was so moist. I'm not sure if there's a place around Bensonhurst that has a good popcorn chicken place but no need to worry since Vivi is there. I just wished that there were more seats since I wanted to enjoy the drink and food with my baby sister. But all is good - no rude staff behind the counter, no long wait and clean. Happy there's a vivi's near me since I know there's another one at 86th st. near the N train."

I called and line was busy, called again put in my order for three drinks and dude said 15 mins. Yeah 15 mins my butt. After everyone who was there before me got their orders I proceeded to go up to counter and asked how much longer cause I waited over 40 mins for 3 drinks. It should take 3 mins to make a drink max. Guy asked what I ordered, I told him two milk tea and a taro and he goes to the back and picks up my drink. So my drinks were sitting there the whole time!!! WTF SERIOUSLY DUDE. How you not call out orders or tell people on the phone that you gotta go up and ask about the drinks. My drinks would have been sitting there all day if I didn't ask. A thanks Vivi, worse service ever, how about hire extra people who can put orders together. Never again am I going back to this location. No organization or leadership.

Call me plain Jane, but the plain pizza is pretty good here, thin crispy crust and semi sweet sauce provide a nice treat/meal, depending on the day lol. Room for improvement less grease per slice, pease. I also never gone wrong with pepporoni rolls and believe it or not, their soup (split pea). Also desserts (icecream) besides zeppoli's are always a plus. Overall,  I say Glendale pizzeria gets a pass for quick, simple taste, and affordable."

Also tried the Calamari , not bad. Simple looking place inside they seem to have a good part of the bar under construction, very LOUD music .. good music to listen too but with a nearly empty inside we could barely hear each other they should keep this in mind & keep the volume at a more reasonable level.

You won't find many places on 35th street with the lounge vibe. If you're ordering food on Uber eat, fine. They have tasty food.BUT if you're coming to sit down here as if it were a restaurant, DON'T. I get shitty service every single time. You won't get served table water, you'll probably have to ask for utensils when your food comes even though it's common sense to bring the food with eating utensils. Idk if these waitresses are intimidated by other women or just have nasty attitudes overall but I've come here with two different female friends on two different occasions and both times the waitresses seem really snooty and it's like they purposefully provide you shitty service. Order out or order from the bar but I repeat do not waste your time sitting here."

I moved out of the area and anytime I'm back I make sure to make a stop in here.I typically order fried chicken & fried rice. However, the chicken & broccoli and BBQ spare ribs are on a completely different level of greatness. It's amazing to see this business withstand the test of time. Stop in and give it a go!"

I've been ordering here for years and I've never had a wrong order or anything less than hot, delicious, filling food. They are open late, have great lunch specials, and really speedy delivery. I especially love the sesame chicken, hunan chicken, ma po tofu, mei fun noodles, egg rolls, and spare ribs. You can get 2-3 meals out of one order, and everything is super flavorful. This is a great NYC Chinese takeout standby, and the best for sure in Astoria."

Killer prices, superstar service and yummy food - what else could you ask for from a delivery/carryout restaurant? I usually order from the ""Health Food"" options and it's less than $7.00 for oodles of steamed veggies and chicken/shrimp with a pint of brown rice! Unlike other establishments, they use large juicy plumpy shrimp! Also, their egg drop and vegetable bean curd soups are fairly good. Shockingly, their Tostones taste decent, however, their French Fries are no bueno. As for the delivery service, it is fast, the food is packaged with love and the delivery man is super nice. I've only been in the restaurant once, but the workers were very nice as well."

This restaurant has the correct pricing. The menu is listed along the top and the day I came here, the covered the old prices with pink sticky notes. They actually lowered the prices of certain menu items. The Shrimp Lo Mein was only $5.40. The Beef & Broccoli was lowered from $9.00 to $6.00. This is an assumption: they might be lowering prices of things they need to get rid of before the ingredients expire.The portions are good, especially for what you pay. One plate can get you pretty full."

The flavor profiles are usually on point and the portions are great, especially at their prices.  The only reason why I'm not giving them 5 stars is because their delivery staff could use some humility when making deliveries.  One delivery person tried to basically deny giving me my food because he wanted the $5 tip in cash and not made online."

They did and they followed it.With consideration, this restaurant deserves 5 stars."

Food: beautifully seasoned, a great variety, and not overly ""Americanized"". We had the steamed dumplings (flavorful), house Lo mien, beef lo mien, and chicken fried rice. The only item that we did not enjoy was the chicken fried rice. No flavor and little to no seasoning. I'm pretty sure they rushed on that item because they forgot to make it (which was okay because I wasn't in a rush but I get the hurry). Crab Rangoon oh my gosh!!! The best! Perfectly fried and the filling WOW!! The young man who helped me at the front was polite and helpful. All in all I will be making this location a regular eatery"

Now you want to get the corn fried empanada trust me! It's the perfect amount of crunch and flavor when bitting into it. The veggie empanada was amazing! Beef & potato is a classic can't go wrong, but that shrimp and crab regular empanada was just something special I tell you lol. You cant go wrong with this spot and the delivery is nice and timely.I would definitely recommend this spot!"

The wheat ones are much better in my opinion. The corn has a better crunch, but it's thick and takes away from the flavors inside. I ordered the cheese and chicken empanadas in corn (they really fill 'em up too, love that!) and I also ordered the cheeseburger and mamis wheat empanadas. I would highly recommend this spot and if you're going to try any of the flavors, definitely add the cheeseburger empanada to your list! So good!!"

(Btw I'm zaddy) To be fair, it had been six hours since my morning smoothie. Sure I put two bananas in that joint but they were chiquita today. It was time to feed the beast.Hit up Lil Colombia and found this quaint spot. It was packed so I figured the empanadas would hit. And oh boy did they! I tried the chicken and ground beef corn ones and they were everything I desired. They also came with this exotic pink sauce (not really exotic, probably ketchup and mayo) and it was the perfect compliment to the rough texture of the corn shell. I was surprised at how large they were considering the price (around $2 each). Seemed like a great value, and three was more than satisfying.Would def frequent this place if I lived closer."

My favorite is their Cuban with their red spicy sauce. *drooling as I think about it. Super super cheap as well. If your ever out super late at night and looking for some late eats... around 2-3am this place is packed. If you live in Jackson Heights, you know you've been here around 3am ordering about four empanadas for yourself. There isn't many places that are cheap with really good food, but this place seriously does it!"
1419,ZYWwYSXWyDlVYIjPgXmIQA,7/10/2018,5 star rating,"There are so many empanadas to choose from! Varying from sweet/dessert fillings to savory ones, there's so many options. My 2 goto ones are the beef and potato or the chili one. The beef and potato is milder, and has a lot of potato whereas the chili one has more of a spicy kick. They have 2 sauces to choose from, the verde and the rojo. Personally, I prefer the green one because it's spicy whereas the other one is really creamy.I wish they had the chili in regular wheat instead of just corn because the corn one is a bit too dense for me, and can be a bit tough and chewy. The wheat pastry is slightly flaky and lighter."

Appetizers were also excellent and they definitely didn't skimp on the liquor in my drink. Can't wait to go back and my only disappointment is that I didn't come here sooner."

We went back here because we had a good time previously however this time someone told my husband (who is a US citizen) to go back his home country. Considering this bar is in queens the most INTERNATIONAL borough in the country this is highly unacceptable behavior from any of the clientele. Clearly if you are not of the Arian race don't go here. Just unbelievable.

But I went there with my husband on a Saturday night, and it was terrible. It was every wanna-be hillbilly from Glendale in the place.  There were obnoxious girls behind us yelling ""Yeeeeeeeeeeerrrrr! before every shot and then taking selfies while pushing us everytime. The bartender kept serving them even though they could barely stand.  Then I saw the ""Trump"" sticker behind the bar. I closed my tab immediately and left. Never supporting this bar again, and I have no desire to mingle with the dipshits there. That sticker explained this crowd perfectly. You want to find the worst Glendale has to offer?

But my experience thus far had told me all i need to know, about how a true Irish bar restaurant is owned and managed.I say ""Owned"" because of the neighborly and internal civic works of JIMMY the owner. This is truly a man of kindness, and a man who sees beyond the almighty dollar.I learn of these stories by way of the bartenders & my boyfriend and fellow yelper Glenn V. , while sitting in front of my 36 OZ porterhouse steak. This piece of choice meat is tender and juicy to a level i find hard to express, so ill just say this...if there's a better steak in Forest hills, Rego Park, Elmhurst, Middle Village & Kew Gardens please let me know.I also hear tales mainly of soups, and other menu items that have come to pass before my time here, yet the passion of the conversations live on, and i hope to experience the meals behind them..."
1427,xGwVfRSgkuuQGUSEa2d7uw,10/31/2013,5 star rating,"When I took up a spot at the bar this past Sunday I was mentally kicking myself. Why has it taken me so long to stop into Yer Man's for some Sunday football? The televisions were well placed so any seat in the bar seemed to have unobstructed, non neck cramp positioning. The menu read well enough for me to come back for some non beer finger food and a few plates whisked past me that looked terrific.The happy hour wings special which are offered some weekdays in addition to Sunday have timers on the point of sale system, so be sure to get your order in before the cutoff. My order was placed five minutes to five and was not in time, (my fault) so I had to pay the full cost. At the throwback price of thirty five cents each any decent wing could suffice for the price if only for basic sustenance. But when you are served up perfectly cooked wings, moist and jucey with a ample amount of sauces to dress up and spice up your wing, missing timers are merely an afterthought at most. Yer Man's serves up such a wonderful blue cheese for your dipping needs. So chunky and dense. The devil is in the details.There is no better place locally to watch weekday sports and weekend football."

It's the only place directly on our commute, other than Starbucks, right now. Though there are other great coffee places not far, they all require a detour.So we stopped in and ordered our standard: a small drip coffee for him and a soy iced latte for me. Typical pricing, as expected, and the coffee was good.I was pleasantly surprised that they use a vanilla soy-milk, which is my preference! They have a small amount of seating and I can absolutely see myself coming back. They have pastries but we didn't try any. I don't know if I'll give their fun latte flavors a try because I tend not to go for super sweet, but I can see them becoming very popular!"

One large decaffeinated cappy please and one large hot chocolate for uncle Don and its a wrap.  Some seating inside but I prefer grab and go . My final verdict is 4 stars for a hot bev that hit the spot and did not rumble my tummy later on . I will be back when weather gets warmer as the cool mocha Frappuccino looks appealing.

1441,JagdE5Vv84kTkHga4Th2EA,11/13/2022,1 star rating,Worst service. Extremely slow. They used to have an older woman screaming at customers to stay behind a line who would miss calling out orders so your food would sit and get cold (and you couldn't do anything about it). Now they have a replacement who has no idea what he's doing. Food takes forever to be made. Only worth going if you order ahead and expect to wait.Do not go with kids. Food takes too long.

With one cashier and one poor guy trying to get orders to customers and delivery guys. Finally after 50~ minutes my buzzer goes off and an entire crowd of people decided to FOLLOW me up. I was quickly handed my order and ushered out. SO WHAT WENT WRONG? The cashier put in the wrong order. Remember I wanted the SHACK STACK that could ONLY be ordered in person. And by the time I'm 3 express stops uptown, I see my order says SMOKE SHACK. I can't EAT the smoke shack for religious reasons and I DONT eat pork. So here I am, agitated... after work... with no food. Because of how this store is managed.And honestly, my cashier might have been more consumed with calling me Sasha Fierce instead of getting my order right."

That's only one of the issues - time after time it takes 20 minutes to be rung up, or I get to the front of the line and they proceed to do FIFTEEN mobile orders in front of me (This has happened. I counted.)Today I found out they are no longer selling chips to in-person customers. This is DISGUSTING behavior and the employees did not convey this new change until I was trying to buy the chips RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. It's borderline malicious how bad this chipotle is and  the incompetence displayed. Disappointing and quite honestly, extremely embarrassing."

However they're all covered with flat plates so there's nowhere to actually plug your stuff in. What happened? Did a bunch of old people show up on opening day and say it was too cold so the next day they all came with space heaters and blew out the fuses? I don't get it. Whatever.

I ordered a meal and didn't get my fries or drink. Then was told it wasn't on my receipt (that they didn't give me) but I was looking at their order monitor and it was there. When I pointed it out, I was told that wasn't my order. But there was no one else in drive thru. Maybe I'm crazy. When the cashier finally decided I was right...they didn't have Dr Pepper so I asked for a coke...they didn't have coke. I ended up with a flat sprite. Yum.

How this mix up occurred I'm unsure. After they ""fixed"" the issue, I was so annoyed I just pulled off. When I got home my should have been sandwich was a box full of nuggets and my daughter still had a boy toy. Good thing we encourage our daughter to play with anything she wants.

Also tired the duck and vegetable  spring rolls, both amazing. The corn egg drop soup and sweet and sour soup were also just great. For an entre we ordered the sizzling shrimp. Wow. Just bursting with flavor and it comes with 7 large shrimp and white rice. Everything was just great and came out burning hot just from the chef.

I was absolutely missing the food from here. This was my first visit since COVID hit. I arrived at about 1:10pm and it was pretty empty. Prior to the pandemic during lunch hour this place would be PACKED. I completely appreciated the fact that there were only four tables occupied.They require vaccination for indoor seating. They do have an outdoor space for people to sit outside if needed. The staff in here isnt friendly. They are those cut throat DRY type of people but i honestly dont care. It makes coming here a in and out process. No one stays and hangs out. You come, eat and leave. Which i LOVE because i can make it in and out within my lunch hour.They DO offer the lunch menu still. Its weird because when we walked in, the waiter only gave us the regular menu. We had to ask for the lunch specials. So make sure you do that. I orderes scallion pancakes. You HAVE TO TRY THIS. it's not even $4 and it's truly the best I've ever had. Its really crispy and you can taste the scallion pieces, so good. I also ordered the fried pork dumplings, another MUST try. So delicious, so flavorful. From the lunch special menu, i asked for the beef and broccoli. It comes with your choice of soup,noodles, rice and the broccoli with beef. Its alot of food and you will always have left overs.We had alot of food left over and when i asked to take it to go, they packed it all together in one chinese take out container. So the peanut sauce from the cold noodles was all mixed together with the beef, broccoli, sauce and rice. That was annoying. When you order take out, they package the lunch menus in these pretty cool three compartment aluminum pans. So all of the separate sauces don't get combined together. Overall i will continue to come here. The food and prices make it so worth it. I'm beyond happpy that this place survived the pandemic so i plan on continuing to support them."

1552,puSz9vokrErQOlyx1IrwXA,12/4/2022,3 star rating,I don't know why the recent horror reviews but I felt the food was passable. My friend and I both got burgers. Both were eatable although nothing I would truly come back for.  Medium rare was more rare than I like but again decent since I didn't get sick and I always prefer juicy burger over well cooked variety.  What was more irritating was fries incurred a steep surcharge ($8?) where I thought they were included. Waitress never mentioned that price of burger was just for burger!

I understand the need for tables, as I work in hospitality but the servers tone was nasty and rude. I feel bad for the younger server who was kind to me but even without asking for the check Marta, dropped it and said here's your check. I live 2 blocks away and just wanted a place to work from home, get a bite to eat, and have some coffee. Next time I'll hit up Pause Cafe where they actually care about guests."
1555,puSz9vokrErQOlyx1IrwXA,11/11/2022,1 star rating,"Not sure what happened. They have been my go-to restaurant for almost 10 years. But today, I realize I need to find someplace else. I placed a pickup order at the Remedy website. I even went 10 minutes later than when the site said it would be ready. But the order wasn't there when I arrived. First I was told it wasn't ready. Understandable, it was raining and they were busy, so I waited another 15 minutes. Still nothing. When I asked again, I was told it was out for delivery - even though the order said pick-up. I was told to go home and check to see if the order had been delivered (which would mean they would have left it outside in the rain). It was not delivered nor was it ready for pick-up. I had no food even though the restaurant swore up and down that it was made."
1556,puSz9vokrErQOlyx1IrwXA,3/8/2023,1 star rating,"It's honestly a shame, I rarely leave reviews but i need to help out another person considering this place. Aesthetically it looks awesome, very 50's diner and cute inside. The place was EMPTY and the service was unbearably slow. I could've gone to the DMV, registered a car and came back and the waitress still wouldn't have been to our table yet. I don't know if it was an off day for her but it seems all other customers had similar wait times and the reviews speak the same language..Pancakes were embarrassingly burnt yet they still sent them out so I asked them to give them a second shot.. 20 minutes later. Overall, at this point I wouldn't recommend it at all but hopefully management sees this and try's to improve. I think customer service training for their staff would go a long way and the food I don't know what to say but atleast for the pancakes, they just need more flavor. They were like eating air.. Again, not trying to bash them I just think management could make this place incredible, but are lacking a few major things"

Came here on a 5am night out with 3 others in varying states of sobriety... and I really mean VARYING. Truly something for everyone - food was mediocre but came fast and decently cheap in a diner where bulletproof glass wouldn't look out of place; exactly what you want at that hour. Staff were snappy and accommodating, a generally fairly hard line to walk.A few things our party got indicative of how gone we were, guesses welcome!- steak and eggs- blueberry pancakes- quesadillas- two eggs scrambled and bacon- yucca fries and mozzarella sticks for the tableNo real food pictures because everything looks exactly what you'd expect...Not a destination but truly an experience to round out a night in LES lol.

I'm glad it's still around. Much of the interior is still the same. A large variety of options, whether you want breakfast, lunch, or dinner at 11pm. Staff were great and accommodating. Got the spinach pie since I don't digest burgers the same I used to. Generous portion sizes - so large I had it for breakfast the next day! Definitely recommend coming as a late night option."

Tacos weren't the best I've ever had and pretty expensive but for the setting it's not awful"
1565,0LjGdHn5paLedudi6DAxDA,7/17/2022,4 star rating,"Toro Loco is close to where I work and caught my eye pretty quickly based on the exterior (it has an edgy white painted brick front with sugar skull vibes) and several co-workers have endorsed it, mostly if not solely for the drinks. I stopped by for lunch this past Friday a little after 1PM. I initially thought it was deserted when I walked in, but they had a decent amount of customers toward the back of the restaurant as well as in their outdoor patio area. I was immediately greeted by the hostess and seated at one of the high top tables just past the bar area with an excellent view of the rest of the establishment.The edginess continued throughout the restaurant - the ceiling had what looked like the top portion of barrels coming down with light bulbs attached to them, and the back of the bar has a decent percentage of liquor bottles housed in these modern cabinets with glass doors. A lot of attention and time went into the design, and it was really impressive. I don't have much of a skillset for interior design, but I can tip my cap to the masters when I see it done well. A LITTLE dark in terms of lighting, but I get the feeling the ambience is geared toward the booze crowd. Understandably so.I ordered the Surf and Turf Burrito ($20), minus the pico de gallo. It was very tasty. Predictably the grilled steak and shrimp worked well together (I feel like that's THE classic surf and turf pairing), and it wasn't overloaded with rice. This was my fourth burrito ever, and it was a solid representative. My only constructive feedback is that the shrimp doesn't add quite as much to the dish as the other ingredients - it's just not an especially flavorful food - and since it's also included within the burrito (not just as decoration on the top) the pieces kept squirting out when I was biting into those areas. A little cumbersome. I will say though that multiple members of the waitstaff suggested a hot sauce-like condiment that I rejected, so some of that is absolutely on me. I thought it might overwhelm the palate, but in hindsight I'd opt for it. The service was excellent. As with many of my recent solo lunch adventures, I was able to order and receive my food within 15 minutes, which is fantastic. I was expecting and willing to be in there for a legit lunch hour, but I honestly could have comfortably been in and out within half that time. The waitress came over every few minutes to check in, and I'd say that the busboy alerted cleared the table less than a minute after I'd moved my dish to the side. Beyond that (and frankly I think this is just as important as any other attribute if not more) everyone I encountered on this adventure was super pleasant and accommodating.  Definitely coming back - at this point I feel a moral obligation to sample something off of that cocktail menu in the not-too-distant future."
1566,0LjGdHn5paLedudi6DAxDA,7/9/2022,3 star rating,"I was really disappointed with this restaurant. I would give most of the food here a 2 star and gave it an extra star for the service. The decor is really nice and the ambiance is a lot of fun. They also have a really nice backyard patio. The service was pretty good. Everyone was attentive and checked in on us during the meal which we appreciated. I got their frozen margarita, it was bitter and didn't really taste like much. As appetizers we got the guacamole and veggie empanadas. The guacamole was spicy as we had asked for it but unfortunately it was under seasoned  including the salt. The empanadas filling was also very under seasoned, it was bland and didn't taste like anything. The crust of the empanada itself was very thick and doughy. All three empanadas had a different consistency when it came to the crust. As an entree, we got the cauliflower pastor tacos. The sauce it came with was delicious and well seasoned. The tacos were pretty good.  Their Adobo fries were also pretty good but just a bit soggy. Their rice and beans were also unfortunately under seasoned and lacked salt. I don't think I'll be coming back here."

The food all came out looking great...and I wouldn't say the food is incredible or shocking; flavor and taste was mid. It was alright! But then.... half of our group had to run to the bathroom after eating. I would rate this one of my top 3 most painful violent stomach pains after eating experience. I'm not sure what the problem here if something was undercooked or if there was some sort of cross contamination. Rest assured I will not coming back here!
1570,nrwOQSXoRXfAYhkdjiUk8g,6/17/2022,1 star rating,I was really hoping it taste good. The matcha flavor is super light. There is too much cream and its not smooth. The cake also unfortunately very dry and rough. There is barely any red bean in it. I am quite disappointed.
1571,nrwOQSXoRXfAYhkdjiUk8g,3/5/2021,4 star rating,"I wanted a matcha crepe cake for my mom's birthday, but something a little unique, so I stumbled upon Delicacy Passion Patisserie. After adding 8 macarons to the cake, it only came out to little over $81, which is an amazing price compared to other shops' matcha mille crepe cakes. The communication with the business over Yelp was also fast and easy.When I picked up the cake, it looked even better than I expected! The macarons have different character stamps on them, and I loved how the writing came out. And how adorable are the edible flowers? The cake itself has good flavor: not bitter and not too sweet. However, as you can see from the cake slice, there was too much cream. I couldn't really taste the layers of the cake, just mouthfuls of cream each time. As for the macarons, kudos to them for the interesting flavors: passion fruit, salted caramel, strawberry rose and honey lavender. I only got to try the latter 3 flavors, but they were all a bit too sweet. I also couldn't quite taste the rose in the strawberry rose macaron. This is just constructive criticism for the business; I would still return to try their other desserts for sure or maybe try their red bean cake next time!"

Pre-Covid I was invited to a Yelp event here, and I really enjoyed the pastries and cakes they offered.  Placed a call in advance and described to the clerk what kind of cake I wanted, from the size to the color and the fillings all were worked out over the phone. I ordered a Matcha green Tea cake with red bean filling, since my sis likes green tea.. The quoted pricing was decent and was promised all cakes were made fresh on premise. When I walked in to pick up the cake I was pleasantly surprise of how cute and pretty the cake turned out. The cake itself, had an abundant Matcha taste to it, which my sister Loved.

For Father's Day, we ordered a cake in advance and came to pick up. We got a 6 inch tiramisu cake. The packaging is in a pretty blue box and it came with a blue cake knife as well! When we brought the cake out after dinner, everyone was taking pictures of it because the cake was pretty! The tiramisu cake itself was good! (~$40) and it wasn't too sweet! Lots of cream and it was enough for me and my family to enjoy! Will definitely be back to order more custom cakes!"

This is a perfect example of when you eat with your eyes and it looks great but when you actually try it, it is bland.I ordered the Bear and the Chocoburger. Both were very interesting in taste but texture-wise, it was hard. I'm not sure if everything is made fresh as in the day of but it didn't seem like it when I bought it. If I'm in the area again, I'll try the other items and see if it was just those items that wasn't as good."

I inquired and booked everything online which was very convenient. They were very informative and gave me a quote within a day or so also reasonably priced. I was told the cake would be close to the photo I presented but might not be the same and the end result was better than the photo itself. The detail on this cake everything was absolutely amazing! I would definitely recommend this bakery for cakes! Awesome job guys! Super impressed and very satisfied!

I went for a Saturday lunch and it was pleasantly hush. Ordered an Ethiopian coffee and the vegetarian combo. Service was very lovely and not slow at all!What I got was piles of veggies and stews atop of injera bread. And lord, did I go ham on that. The injera is tangy and soft, almost velvety. The options they gave you were a wonderful sample of vegetarian cuisine for Ethiopia. And everything was flavorfullll. Its very reminiscent of Indian food if you're familiar. The coffee...just tasted like coffee. Overall, a good start to Ethiopian food if you're curious!"

I ate here with my friend, who has had ethiopian food many times, and usually orders the vegetarian combo. She said that this was one of the better vegetarian combos she's ever had. We split lentil sambosas and both really enjoyed them. I also got the vegetarian combo and it was delicious, I thought each dish was so amazing and different. I had a red sangria which was good and strong, my friend had a white wine. Prices were very reasonable. Now for the cons: The decor & ambiance were eh. A table near us was served beef when they ordered lentil sambosas, a struggle I understand as someone who does not eat meat."

1617,sjOp9UbbfKbohpEjQt2JRg,11/5/2021,1 star rating,I am a huge fan of Ethiopian food but this place is pretty bad. The seating is pleasant but that is all good I can say. The service was inattentive.  The bathroom was out of soap and you eat the food with your hands. They didn't ask for proof of vaccination.  The injera was made of white flour not Teff. The food was bland and salty and made me sick after.
1618,sjOp9UbbfKbohpEjQt2JRg,2/5/2017,4 star rating,"A friend of mine recently got back from a trip to Ethiopia and has been ranting and raving about the cuisine there. I figured, upon his recommendation, Meske would be a good place to dabble in one of the few cuisines I've never tried.This restaurant is like a low key, no frills, hidden Hell's Kitchen gem. The food was delicious! The service was a tad slow but we were in no rush. On a Saturday even around 6pm the restaurant was only about 1/3 full. No need to make a reservation.My friends and I shared the sambosas as our appetizer and they were juicy and yummy. I ordered the kitfo (like steak tartare), served raw...I like to live dangerously. What a portion! They gave SO MUCH MEAT! Yes! I couldn't even finish it. The staple Ethiopian bread, injera, is so good too. It tastes like fluffy sourdough flatbread and is a great complement to the food in general. What I learned is that Ethiopian food is actually rather clean, and incredibly filling!I do have to say, there was a secret star to the meal, and it wasn't the food. We got a pitcher of sangria for $20 and it was some of the best sangria I've had in a while. Who would've guessed?!"
1619,sjOp9UbbfKbohpEjQt2JRg,1/5/2019,2 star rating,"I ordered from here tonight using Grubhub. It was an estimated 30-40min delivery time. So imagine my surprise when I saw on the tracker that the delivery person was on his way within 15min of placing my order. However, it looked like the person either got lost or somehow was unable to find a very tall apartment complex because the person not only passed my building but went back to the restaurant. I don't even live that far from the restaurant, so for a delivery person to no know the area is unacceptable. No call was made to me asking me where I lived or even what the issue was. The person stayed at the restaurant for another 20min before arriving at my apartment building exactly 40min after placing my order. My main concern, after all that time, was the food was either going to be cold or the injera bread would be mushy from absorbing the sauces. When I finally received my dinner, the food was luke warm and the spot where the chicken was on the injera was very soft. Thankfully, a second piece of injera was included. I ordered the Special Chicken Tibs. In the description, it said that the sauce was mild. To me, the sauce was spicy and I felt like my mouth was on fire. Unfortunately, this took away from allowing me to get a good taste of the flavors. The dish also came with, what I believe, are side dishes. Nothing in the description said that this was part of the meal. I'm not sure what they were, but they were brown and yellow/green colored with the consistency of mashed potatoes. This wasn't terrible as it mellowed out the spices from the chicken but it was bland.The price wasn't that bad compared to other places I have tried. I think I would give this place a second chance and next time to tell them to not put any spice in it for me."

The ambiance is perfect for an intimate dinner with friends or a date. The wait staff was highly attentive from start to finish. With bulky layers on a rainy night, the coat check was very appreciated. We started the night off with white asparagus with hollandaise and the shaved Brussel sprout salad. The asparagus was delicious and complimented by shaved black truffles, but the Brussel sprout salad stole the show. It was tangy, crunchy, creamy, and all around outstanding. I would come back to New York for that dish alone. For dinner, we had the steak frites, the burger, and the main lobster. The steak frites came with a béarnaise and a butter & grilled to the perfect temp. Our friend said burger was definitely the best one he had ever had and each bite was better than the last. I ordered the main lobster & enjoyed the dish as a whole. The lobster itself was unfortunately a bit rubbery. The lobster bisque was perfect, but the mushroom royale was absolutely insane  I have never had anything like that, it was indescribable truly."
1621,kSX8M82uUAcw5vfhn8jMng,2/25/2023,4 star rating,"Very solid food here.  I got a reservation for 2 a couple weeks in advance as this place was a frequently recommended spot for burgers in the city.  The ambiance was very regal and the staff/service was great and prompt.  The food was solid - we both got the black label burger which came with a mountain of French driest that were skinny and crispy.  The burger itself was very basic, really nice meat quality with a great peppery char bite. It was topped with grilled onions in a kind of au jus sauce that was good but honestly a little bland.  It was missing a salty bite that it desperately needed to elevate it.  Overall, solid meal, a little pricey but I wasn't expecting an amazing experience either.  Au cheval is still the best burger in NYC!"
1622,kSX8M82uUAcw5vfhn8jMng,11/6/2022,5 star rating,"Wow what an experience! The inside of this restaurant really takes you back in time. The mural on the walls was originally painted in the early 1900s and adds to the timely tavern vibe inside. The servers and staff are all extremely nice and very accommodating. Bone Marrow: 9/10Wowww what a dish! This is definitely one of the most popular appetizers and rightfully so. You scoop the hot bone marrow onto these toasted slices of bread and it's perfection. It's very fatty and the toasts were a big too oily. If you don't like fat you won't like this and either way you should definitely share this dish. It was also served with onions and those were scrumptious.Black Label Burger: 9/10Is it worth $40 and the hype? Short answer is yes. The beef patty is premium meat and you can taste the difference. I got mine with bread instead of the bun for allergy reasons, so I really got to taste the meat. The grilled onions were a great addition and the patty was very juicy. The fries were perfectly crispy and plentiful. I loved this dish!Foie Gras: 6.5/10The foie gras although supposed to be served after being seated still had a hard pate texture. I didn't like the bread it was served with either.Chocolate soufflé: 8/10This soufflé was served fresh out of the oven and was so moist and fluffy! It came with a delicious vanilla creme. I wish there was more gooey chocolate in the middle. It mainly was sponges bread and wasn't very chocolatey. The drinks are good and strong. The bread is also served complimentary and warm. I will definitely be back and recommend this spot for a special occasion or if you are visiting! The location adds to the fun vibe as well. So wonderful!"
1623,kSX8M82uUAcw5vfhn8jMng,12/2/2022,5 star rating,"I did not think a $36 burger would live up to the hype but it does here. It is one of the best burgers I have tasted and the meat just tastes so rich and cooked perfectly with the redness in the middle. You get a bunch of fries with it and these shoe string fries are perfection.If you do want to order something else, highly recommend the mussels! The broth was amazing and I would want to drink that with everything and dip all my bread and fries in that. One of the best mussels I have had and you get a large amount of mussels and fries that it does feel like a steal for that price.Reservations do fill up but you can always put your name in and grab a drink at a place nearby or they might have a spot at the bar for you!"

I say nimble because the restaurant is cramp, we were sitting so close to the other table. I mean I can easily accidentally slap someone if I'm using my hands to talk. Since it's so cramp I can hear everyone's conversation and I can barely hear myself think. Also, the place has mood lighting that is quite dim like I'm in a hollister, so phone couldn't eat first.On to the food, we got the Minetta burger and the New York strip. The burger was amazing, so tender and very easy to eat. I have heard the black label burger is even more tender like a great steak but I wanted to try the classic burger. New York strip, according to my boyfriend it was quite good, he enjoyed it medium rare. When you're done eating you can check out the comedy cellar or other comedy clubs around the corner. An old school spot in the village with great food, just don't mind the noise, crowdedness and enjoy the food."

Our waiter, Noah, was friendly, attentive, charming, and still very professional at the same time. He gets 5 stars. We started with the French onion soup which was delicious. Checked off all the marks for what you want in a great French onion soup. Next the bone marrow. This was definitely the star of the evening. From the moment it gets in the dining room it has heads turning. It is definitely an eye catching plate. Rich, decadent, flavorful meat butter that paired perfectly with shallot confit. Next up is the reason we came!! The Black Label Burger. The expectation scale was high for this one. Unfortunately those expectations were not met. It was not a bad burger by any means whatsoever, but when the price tag is considered, the burger under delivers. The hand cut (I think) fries were very good. I would certainly return to try some other menu items. You should go try for yourself. ENJOY!!!"
1628,kSX8M82uUAcw5vfhn8jMng,3/25/2023,4 star rating,"I stopped in here with my better half and another couple for a late brunch. The overall food quality was quite good, but the service was somewhat spotty. It was clear that there were some ""regulars"" there that were receiving faster and better service than we were. As just one example, one of my dining companions waited an absurdly long time for drink that was literally a neat glass of scotch. That should have taken a bartender all of 10 seconds to pour, and I believe he waited close to 20 minutes. During that interval, the four top next to us ordered cocktails, received them, and had time to make a toast. That may seem like a minor quibble, but that is also what makes the difference for me between four and five stars--Absolute attention to every detail"

Everything was tasty, portions perfect for two. Had the kale salad which was dressed nicely. The gnocchi had fresh tomato sauce. And the pizza had the perfect amount of spicy honey to my liking."

Service (1/5): They forgot our order so needed to wait additional time for it to be made once arriving for pick up. Also had issues redeeming the free dessert offer that's on Yelp if you check in. We ended up paying -! Additional $20 for a dessert that we only ordered because it was supposed to be free.Food (3.5/5): it was soggy and falling apart but the flavor of the pizza and dough was great.Overall, disappointed with the experience but would potentially give this place another chance for dine in"

I lived in Italy and this place really does make authentic pizza in a brick oven. The pasta is also delicious, and they have one of my favorite Roman foods (fried artichokes). I've been twice now and will definitely return. It's a great place to take visitors."

Had the Margherita(no slices but good for one personal pizza), secret spritz, tiramisu and espresso. Pizza was good, well seasoned. I asked for extra basil and they assisted. Service was great.

The Pummarola and Prosciutto Pizza was also a winner in my book and really hit the spot. The dough was quite chewy. Good amounts of prosciutto. The slices were really big though! Would come back here.

The order took nearly two hours to arrive, and the food was cold when I received it. The turkey burger was overcooked, and the entire meal was bland. It was a huge letdown, especially after such a long wait. I've heard good things about their desserts, so I'll try it the next time I'm in the mood for something sweet."
1642,QxthR7-GAbqj1cLocOD6Nw,1/29/2023,2 star rating,My friend said she'd been here before and insisted we go. The service was slow and awful. The food was terrible. My coffee was terrible. The dessert was bland. The space was too dark and crowded. All around an awful experience. What did I have you ask? Cafe au lait which was too strong. Eggs that were lukewarm. Turkey bacon that was burnt. Baklava that tasted gritty and like nothing. The waitress had to be summoned to come to our table numerous times. I mean just a mess. I don't know why there were so many people there. My friend remarked she liked my hair color when we went outside. It was so dark in there she couldn't tell and we went for lunch. Never again.

The fact of the matter is when you are in Bay Ridge you go here for dessert. That's it. Everyone knows that there are a lot of awesome restaurants in Bay Ridge, and when you're done eating there you come to this joint.If you want me to talk about their actual food, yes? everything is awesome.In particular I love their Greek pastries, and their Greek coffee, and their fusions of Greek pastries with cheesecake.

1645,QxthR7-GAbqj1cLocOD6Nw,6/6/2022,3 star rating,"Was craving for Baklava, so went to this place. The Baklava slice is huge. It was good. Also tried the Kataifi for the first time, but i guess that was the last time too. The texture of the shredded pastry did not sit well with me and i found it dry, probably why it's best eaten with syrup. You can order ice cream on the side too. I also need to be more familiar with how the Greeks ordered their coffee. We were expecting big cups, but both our orders came in espresso cup shots. The servers are friendly though, helpful and patient enough to explain the menu to us. Going back for their baklava, and probably try some other stuff on their menu."

1647,QxthR7-GAbqj1cLocOD6Nw,8/9/2020,2 star rating,I wish I could give it more stars but they don't follow the mask requirements that strictly. I was so disgusted to see some of their employees without mask standing behind the counter especially when one of them was coughing into their hands! I do see their servers with mask but a lot of them were wearing them incorrectly (some with their nose out and some under their chin). Doesn't give me much confidence about their pandemic precaution..They did earn some of their stars for the desserts. I like their cheesecake and bakery goods but I don't think I would risk my life coming here.

To get anyone's attention you literally have to wait mad long or wait until someone is looking at you to wave to them. They are so busy chatting amongst themselves but are not paying attention to the customers. The food is amazing but the service needs work."

1652,IvcoTrvUdlhtpp2_pn_rAA,4/13/2023,4 star rating,"I came here for an organized birthday brunch with a prix fixe menu, but from what I experienced the food here is delicious but BEWARE if you get invited to brunch here since my bill for bottomless came to a whopping $124. The prix fixe comes with apps including a Mediterranean cucumber salad, a spread of dips with pitas, and spinach cheese pockets (did not eat). The salad was refreshing (and hard to mess up in the first place) and the hummus and other spreads were delicious, with perfectly seasoned pitas. The bottomless mimosas came out in pitchers and were truly bottomless, pretty good alcohol to juice ratio. I ordered the shakshouka which I genuinely enjoyed with pieces of toast and chickpeas rounding out the dish. It was HOT and I had to wait a bit to eat it, leaving me with leftovers that I was happy about. The inside is upscale and the atmosphere gives a Miami vibe with music and encouraged drinking. I do want to go back after seeing the espresso martini menu, but I'm not sure if I can stomach the price of another full meal here."
1653,IvcoTrvUdlhtpp2_pn_rAA,7/14/2022,4 star rating,"Food, service & ambiance were great. The only complaint is the tables were right next to each other and it felt like you were dining with the couple next to you. Also definitely wasn't 6ft distance. The feta fries... wayyyy too much sauce and feta, the fries got soggy so I would recommend ordering maybe the ""toppings"" on the side and then dipping the fries into it as you go. MUST ORDER THE HALLOUMI CHEESE. Best item on their menu for sure!!!!! The fish was great too.The shrimp was ok, mainly just sauce and a couple of pieces of shrimp. If you get the grilled fish then definitely ask them to go light on the oil or butter if you don't want it soaked in either of those."

I am very sad I didn't get their names but they were FAB! A gentleman & beautiful young lady took great care of us. We ordered drinks & ordered happy hour menu appetizers for dinner. BEST DECISION EVER!!! We ordered the pikilia, tomato salad, spanakopita, avgolemono & the sesame feta... everything was phenomenal. The sesame feta was one of the best things I've ever had & the vibe was amazing. The restaurant was lovely and I only saw the ambiance of the dining area in my way to the restroom (which was also lovely & clean). No regrets here people, we had a 10 out of 10 rating at the bar. Great service & FANTASTIC food. Thank you to the lovely mixologists that made our evening perfect!"
1655,IvcoTrvUdlhtpp2_pn_rAA,7/17/2022,4 star rating,"Delicious mediterranean food and sleek, modern interior but LOUD AS HECK INSIDE LOL. I don't know how it is during lunch time because I came pretty late for dinner but I could not hear my friends across the table because the music is so loud inside. It's great vibes and the DJ plays some cool Greek style music but don't plan on coming here for an intimate convo. Saw lots of bday celebrations happening next to us though!The food itself definitely makes me want to come back. I particularly loved the tuna tartare and grilled octopus, but I do have to say that everything is seasoned pretty salty here. The lavraki was also very tender and flavorful, and the filet mignon kebabs come out as a generous portion. I had a red sangria on the side and it was a solid drink. Came here thanks to a friend's rec and glad I tried it out! Maybe I'll sit outside next time though."
1656,IvcoTrvUdlhtpp2_pn_rAA,2/14/2023,5 star rating,"This place is truly a blast. I was looking for a place to celebrate my birthday and a friend of mine recommended the party brunch  at Kyma. Didn't take much convincing on her part for me to make a rez....what 30 year old isn't a sucker for brunch?? Kyma runs a party brunch the last Sunday of each month. This isn't your average brunch. There's a DJ, people playing instruments, sparklers, napkin tossing, and standing on the furniture is not only allowed but encouraged. There were 9 of us in my group and we had the best time. The food was tasty, the service was wonderful, and the entire staff was kind and attentive. This was a great experience and definitely worth the price. The bottle service was on point and all the food came out piping hot. Everyone was here for a good time - the crowd was lively and fun. I really want to come back for dinner. I definitely recommend if you are looking for a fun brunch in the city."
1657,IvcoTrvUdlhtpp2_pn_rAA,4/14/2023,4 star rating,"LOVE the food here, but wasn't too keen on the service. A few people from the staff including our server were hovering in the corner and looking at us/whispering to each other. Maybe because we had so much food on our table. It was a bit uncomfortable. Thankfully I was with my loving husband, and that was more important to me. We are foodies and love to order multiple dishes from restaurants we've never been to before. This was our first time at Kyma, and every single item was amazing. Disclaimer: the stuffed grape leaves are served cold, which I didn't realize until after ordering. Other than that, everything was spot on."
1658,IvcoTrvUdlhtpp2_pn_rAA,11/5/2022,1 star rating,"Not as good as the Long Island location. Asked the waitress about the dip served with the pita (as is the case at the LI location) she proceeded to explain that they don't just give ""free dip"" and that you have to order it! RUDE! Disrespectful! You can say the same thing in a nicer way. She then proceeded to let us know that they are very busy so we should put in the order for everything at the same time! She also brought us the check without asking for it!The food overall was good but the Sesame Feta was not as good as the LI location. Also, the menu is much smaller than the LI location.So basically we were treated like sh$t and paid Kyma prices for it."

Place wasn't too busy when we first got there but was packed and had people waiting by the time we were having dinner.

If you can I recommend dining in because everything is still hot and steamy! We had a little party and decided to place an order for delivery. Just like the poor reviews say they didn't deliver on time. (I placed an order at 12pm for 4:45pm... food came around 5:10) I wouldn't take any stars away for that because it is what it is. They are busy, they might be understaffed but they make it up with how good their food tastes! So just call in 30-45 minutes before to order and you'll be fine! Everything is always delicious and on point! A must, must try!!! If you like mushrooms... definitely try their stuffed mushroom appetizer! We also love sausage and broccoli rob pasta!!! The best!"

The waitresses are all so friendly and attentive. This has nothing to do with the wonderful waitresses. We decided to take our kids my mom & in total there was 8 of us. I ordered chicken scampi sounded great but I get it and my knife could barely go through the chicken it was like hard rubber this was just my dish everyone else's was good  I called the waitress over and told her and she took my plate away and some man came from the back and told me to check the middle of it As I explain to him I couldn't even get to the middle of the chicken and I wouldn't want to  at that point he gave me a dirty look and looked at what everybody else ordered at the table and said oh chicken and chicken and walked away and was beyond rude to me in front of my family it was a very uncomfortable situation why would anyone want to try to get to the middle of a bad piece of food? My husband went over to tell him it would bounce of the floor I can't express anymore how bad the chicken was and how utterly rude he was it was almost unbelievable the way he behaved the bill was over $300 which we expected and we were happy until that moment needless to say that man was disgustingly rude and should realize in these inflated times people can barely afford to even go out to eat we will NEVER go there againTell everyone I know our experience.

Thin crust with tons of vodka sauce and melty cheese on top. $26 for one pie. It's so good, my mother decided to order it two times in a week. Their sauce is so creamy and delicious and I love that they put sesame seeds on the crust. I just go for pickup but their staff seem super friendly. I came on a Friday evening, and their restaurant was at capacity and filled with people."
1668,GeoR6dpTUEpdIoyAd68Irg,8/8/2022,1 star rating,Although the food may still be good we will never eat there again. We walked in to loud rap music and told the waitress to please lower the music. There was only one other table seated and we could not hear ourselves think let alone speak.  Sheus that she could not lower the music nor change the channel to more dinner friendly music. She also said that she has to listen to this music all day when she is serving and it is unpleasant for her as well.  One of the guys lowered the music for about 3minutes while we ordered food and then it was raised again to a loud decibel and horrible music.  We cancelled our order and left and will never go there again. someone else ordered food and came to pick it up.  she had a cast on her leg and called to ask someone to bring her food out to the car which they refused to do.  There is a bus stop directly in front so parking is prohibited.Rude horrible workers inside and an owner who doesn't give  a da--.
1669,GeoR6dpTUEpdIoyAd68Irg,4/18/2022,1 star rating,"DO NOT ORDER ONLINE! I ordered on Seamless. After 1 hour and 45 min of waiting, the food came and it was disgusting. (See photos) The vodka slice tasted like cardboard and the cheese peeled right off while eating it. It was not even melted onto the pizza (see pic). The chicken roll was burnt on both sides and soggy on the bottom on top of being reheated multiple times. The chicken roll wasn't even full inside. The rice ball was cracked, burnt as well, as hard as a rock and tasted disgusting. The girls that work there are awful at customer service. The first time I called (after waiting 1 hour and 15 min), they couldn't even find my online order. Then she said ""the driver is on his way"". She couldn't even tell me where he was or how much longer. After waiting another 30 min, I called back and ""another girl"" (sounded like the same one) said that there are other orders besides mine to deliver. Quality of food was disgusting and the customer service is disgusting. Never ordering again."

Got a 1/4 lb of the scallion cream cheese and it was every bit as good as described. So so perfect and refrigerates well. The texture is great even after a couple of days. Also tried the everything bagel with plain cream cheese and it was such a good value for the quality! Never buying cream cheese anywhere else!Things to note: CASH ONLY and no seating. Enjoy!

Nova lox bagels have always been my favorite and I've tried many to compare with, and I can say this wasn't anything special. If anything, there were some spots missing so a few bites felt off. I got the nova lox everything bagel with tomato, onion, and lox spread, and for a $16 dollar bagel (with the add-ons), I'd expect it to be loaded to the brim, but this was average at best.The other bagels weren't as expensive so they might be a better deal, and this place must offer some good things since the line went way out the door, but paying a high price for a mediocre bagel wasn't a good experience. Also, they only take cash so come prepared."
1694,YKsHo3V-PkeRQdLYOdG7ZA,9/19/2022,3 star rating,"I had an error in judgment the previous morning and failed to grab a bagel, so best believe I made a bee-line for the nearest bagel shop on the following day! Unfortunately, Absolute Bagel, being the only option in this part of town, was the closest shop to me. I was met with a slow-moving line spilling out the door, maybe 20 people deep. As I finally made it to the entrance 30 minutes later I realize they are running a not only small but downright inefficient operation. Only three workers were manning the fort. Two were baking and churning out the boiled and baked bagels -- one double tasking to ring people up -- and a third was taking orders, running around the other side of the L-shaped display case to prep it, pack it up to then call out the order, and then run back around the other side to take the next order. How frustratingly inefficient.They had a number of cream cheese options which looked and sounded appealing. They even had some vegan options in the form of their ""Tofutti"" cream cheese. On the other hand, I went for a sesame bagel with a sun-dried tomato cream cheese spread. I asked for ""untoasted"" but received a toasted bagel in its stead, so I was charged an extra 10 cents on top of my deflated bagel! The cream cheese slab thankfully was not overkill and tasted rather yummy with a delightful thick texture.Nonetheless! The whole process here was nearly 1-hour and the product was far from worth the wait. I get that they are locally owned and a small operation but they could easily service their patrons more effectively by streamlining their process. You can get a more fulfilling bagel elsewhere and with a significantly shorter wait time. If you go earlier than 10:30am and there isn't a line, maybe pop in, but one guidance is ""absolute"" and that is if there is a line -- avoid!!"
1695,YKsHo3V-PkeRQdLYOdG7ZA,1/19/2023,5 star rating,"I am obsessed with a good NY bagel! It had the perfect texture on the outside and chewy on the inside. I got an everything bagel with jalapeño cream cheese. I wish I had access to this place all the time. We went there on a Saturday morning and the inside was packed and by the time we left, the line was out the door. You know it's good when you see that! They are cash only so come prepared. It wasn't too bad of a wait, all the employees were working hard to get people through the lines."

The bagels themselves are really good quality with a nice chew and a hefty amount of cream cheese, just how I like it. My friend and I were planning on a whole day of eating so we ended up splitting one, and it still filled us up pretty well."
1698,YKsHo3V-PkeRQdLYOdG7ZA,11/1/2022,4 star rating,"Be ready for at least a 30 minute wait on weekends. This is one of the best bagel places in NYC, the dough has that amazing chew that epitomizes the New York bagel.Their everything bagel is a true culinary accomplishment. Highly recommend one of the many spreads they offer, I often go with the lox spread but they are all excellent. I would avoid the egg and cheese option since they don't make the eggs fresh.Bagels with spreads generally run between $5-10. Cash only and there is no ATM onsite."
1699,YKsHo3V-PkeRQdLYOdG7ZA,1/17/2023,5 star rating,"Just the most solid bagel place ever. Get an un toasted everything bagel with scallion cream cheese, or with egg tomato onion and lettuce, and it'll be such a chill and solid way to start off your morning. Like honestly could not pick a more perfect and easy place to get speedy breakfast!!"

1702,JV5oa5-KGdiWnqrKPoxSug,7/1/2021,4 star rating,"I was attracted to the orchard road flavor, which has a mix of pandan and ube ice cream flavors, so we ordered this! The employees were quick and friendly. I'm even surprised they offered sampling of flavors given COVID is still present. The orchard road flavor was mildly sweet, which was a nice surprise for us! It was a nice treat to eat without feeling too stuffed or dehydrated. I wished I could have tasted more of the ube flavor, but the pandan flavor was refreshing, especially on a summer's day!"
1703,JV5oa5-KGdiWnqrKPoxSug,5/7/2022,4 star rating,"We ended up at Kaylee's after a bunch of drinks and a craving for ice cream, and the cookies and cream hit the spot. It was perfectly creamy with just the right amount of cookie... delicious! Will definitely come back to try some other flavors."
1704,JV5oa5-KGdiWnqrKPoxSug,9/26/2021,3 star rating,"Kaylee's Creamery has a small menu with a couple of interesting flavors - early gray being a personal favorite. But usually a limited set of choices means that a place does those few items *really* well, and I'm not sure Kaylee's fits that description.I've never had ice cream from Kaylee's that's been especially noteworthy. Plus the toppings are pretty unimpressive, with even fewer options than the ice cream flavors. And when I tried marshmallows (from lucky charms cereal), they were stale, clearly having been left out for too long.The ice cream here is fine, but I can't shake the impression that they're sort of mailing it in. And there are lots of great ice cream places in the vicinity, so I'm not sure Kaylee's will be at the top of my list in the future."
1705,JV5oa5-KGdiWnqrKPoxSug,4/1/2022,3 star rating,"It's a quiet, low key ice cream place, which I have not heard about until my friend suggested we come by and visit them from our appointment that afternoon. It didn't disappoint.  I had a pistachio ice cream, which I enjoyed."
1706,JV5oa5-KGdiWnqrKPoxSug,7/27/2021,4 star rating,"Not wanting to be anywhere in ktown to avoid crowds, I headed here for dessert. The staff were really nice and and welcoming. There are several benches/tables outside that were surprisingly semi occupied. Be warned though, the street is being fixed so there's plenty of those road plates up and down the street. Meaning? Noisy af. Also, all trucks driving down this street, seem to be speeding.The matcha wasn't as flavorful as I hoped, but it was pretty standard.The earl grey was light and refreshing, with citrus undertones as a finish, this was the winner for the day."
1707,JV5oa5-KGdiWnqrKPoxSug,8/20/2021,5 star rating,This ice cream quality is no joke. This is GOOOOOOD ice cream...The flavor of the base is excellent and so it the texture.Got two scoops for $7.50 and the scoops were s'mores and earl grey. Earl grey is legit....like savoring tea in a cold slow motion melting system...S'mores is also great. Highly recommend
1708,JV5oa5-KGdiWnqrKPoxSug,6/7/2022,4 star rating,Quaint little shops with limited but exotic flavours. I had the Earl grey citrus with caramel on top. Good dessert after lunch.
1709,JV5oa5-KGdiWnqrKPoxSug,8/10/2021,5 star rating,"These days I mainly look for two things in my ice cream: good consistency and interesting flavor. This place delivers both beautifully. Their ice cream is super smooth and creamy! Honestly, once you've had the finer things in life, you'll never go back to the subpar ones that are usually too gummy/viscous. My fav has been the Pot of Gold, but the Earl Grey is a close second. Also recommend the strawberry shortcake one. Their flavors are just right - not too subtle or intense, and doesn't taste too artificial."

After a month or so I decided to give it another try and I went there again. This time at 3 PM, so no rush and I this time I can talk to the manager that he should have put a sign on the door in case this happens.

Unfortunately a couple of the people working in the cafe were very rude. After grabbing coffee and some food we tried to find a place to sit, but the tables were taken in the front. There was a roped off area in the back that had empty tables. We asked if that area would be open since it was so busy and received a cold ""no"" and back-turn from a woman working at the cafe. Later a different woman working was trying to push through a small crowd in the cafe and was yelling ""excuse me"" repeatedly and in an annoyed tone. I get that service work isn't always fun and people have bad days. But honestly, it just ruined the mood. Also the cafe is awkwardly located at the front of the Ralph Lauren store and would be a good option for people trying to shop, but it's not a very good or relaxing atmosphere for those just looking for a cup."

Also the indoor is kept so clean, bright, and polished.The service was extremely nice, from holding the door, as soon as you enter, walking us around the Ralph Lauren part of the store, and even helping suggest coffee items. I ordered one iced matcha latte for 6 dollars (about the same as your typical Starbucks order). I realized later that I did not add sugar to my latte, and the service prepared a whole new drink for me. It tasted great, was a quick-grab-and go. Highly recommend taking a visit."

The cafe and store were decorated so festively and the cafe also sells other merch from coffee beans to mugs to tshirts. The coffee itself was fairly priced, nothing more than average Starbucks prices. I got a chai latte which was amazing for a cold winter day. I think you can also sit down to eat in the cafe with table service but I didn't try that this time. My favorite part was honestly the cup sleeves, the bears are so incredibly cute. I would come again if I was in the area just to transport back into festive/holiday spirit."
1745,RGK1ASygW8Q4JeJJ-Az9Xw,12/14/2022,5 star rating,Ralph's has been my favorite coffee spot in Manhattan since 2016 - back when they had one in the RL 5th Ave store. That location closed for a while and I'm not sure if it's back but this UES one is just as lovely if not more so. I highly recommend!

Firstly, the lamb was dry and flavorless. Everything was poorly seasoned and therefore, bland. The platter came with rice that was just plain white rice - not basmati for pulao like most middle eastern restaurants offer. For one thing, the prices has been increased due to the pandemic, which I understand. However, the man on the phone was annoyed when I inquired about the $5 off $35 purchase discount online. He said that that offer was no longer available. You would think they would honor it since they seem too lazy to take it down/update their website. Instead, he asked if I still wanted the order and when I said yes, he hung up right away. Overall, rude service and bland food. Personally, I think the other restaurants around are much better in both price, service, and food."

Very friendly staff and had lots of patience with me (it was my first time here so it took me some time to order).Ordered 3 sandwiches and 1 za'-atar pie. It took about 15 minutes for everything to be ready. I had the shawarma mix (chicken and lamb/beef) sandwich with garlic sauce instead of tahini. It was delicious and very filling (I think one is good enough to fill you up). So far this is one of my favorite places for shawarma.  I tried the za'atar pie, it was ok because it wasn't really fresh (it had been sitting there for I don't know how long and they just heated it up for me). The pie was a bit hard so wish they would offer it but if it was done to order. Prices? Affordable. Sandwiches I believe start at around $10Due to covid they are only offering take out. I do wish all the customers would be a little more thoughtful and wear their mask when picking up their food. Would recommend the staff to inform the customers to please return with their masks. Overall would definitely recommend this place. Great thing is that they are open late in case you decide you want to eat a late meal. Definitely get garlic sauce on whatever you order (it's strong but so good!)"

However, when 12:15 pm rolled around, no food arrived. I called them every 15 min starting around 12:20 pm, and each time, they sounded annoyed on the phone and told me the driver was almost there. At 1:15 pm, an houR after my scheduled delivery time, they told me that they were very sorry and the fax with my order just now came out. To compensate, they gave me a few desserts, and my food finally arrive 1:35 pm.I would give them benefit of the doubt, but it didn't sound like they were trying to understand the situation and the English communication was poor. I don't know if it was a mistake on GrubHub's end, but I wish they had real-time order tracking like UberEats does.As for the food, it was really good, and the instructions were followed. No utensils and my falafel sandwich ($7) came with no onions. The flavors were done well too. The free desserts we got were baklava and basbousa I believe. I like them, just only in small amounts, because they are always too sweet--regardless of where they're from."

I placed a ""rapid pick-up"" order before I headed out to pick up my order. It took me 15 minutes just to arrive at the restaurant. I thought that gave me plenty of time so that my food would be ready once I arrived. Ha! There were at least 30 people also waiting for their foods AND that's not including the delivery drivers that were waiting for their orders too. :\ I had to wait a 1/2 hour after the time that I chose for my pick-up order to be ready before it was actually prepared and in my hands. And, if that wasn't enough, I didn't receive my baguette or napkins with my order. I'm lucky that it was still warm and included a spoon. I won't do this again!"

One of the female workers complained about how 'f'd up' the customers were in front of me. I feel like she was talking about me which confused me because this was my first time at this location. I think they tampered with my food because my throat felt funny after eating here. I wasn't rude or anything to the staff, I ordered at the kiosk and waiting patiently for my order. I'm starting to think this was racially motivated. I will not return here"

If you don't know about this subscription, it's something like $8.99 per month for unlimited coffee, which, even without a promo, is so worth it. Anyway, service here is your standard chain restaurant service. They are fast and impersonal (as expected). Easy to get your cup. No complaints.Coffee is standard as well. They have unsweetened almond milk out on the counter, always a great thing. The seating is where this location lost points with me. It's all downstairs and it feels like a dungeon. The music on the speakers is also so loud that people you're on the phone with will hear it. So I was uncomfortable all around and didn't feel like I could sit and relax here.

We have too many great Thai restaurants in elmhurst to settle for average or not great Thai food. That's what I got today. My husband got a lackluster pad Khee mao (not much flavor), and my beef pad garlic was so dry and flavorless I could only have a few bites. It tasted as if they put some boiled beef in with rice and threw dried garlic on top. That's it. No sauce or flavor. We've been to Thailand three times, and this is not at all what this meal is supposed to taste like. Even tho we live very close to pata, I doubt we will return."

1774,0B3WbaM1hnn3Xut1bitSyw,12/31/2020,5 star rating,By far one of the best Thai food restaurants I've been to. I think what makes this place special is that grandma is throwing down in the kitchen. Her and her grand daughter are like dynamic duo's. I love the rolled up shrimp rolls and the basil  shrimp friend rice. I had the pad swee ou  (probably spelling this wrong lol) and that's also a favorite. The hospitality is amazing and food is great. They do take out as well as sit in however this is a small and cozy spot so if you plan on sitting in make sure to call and ask if they are not packed. Your temp is taken when you come in which is appreciated. All and all I am hooked and definitely will be back for a 3rd time.

1776,0B3WbaM1hnn3Xut1bitSyw,9/21/2019,4 star rating,"This café is a tiny space of about four tables with fun, quirky décor.  There's a definite relaxed, casual vibe here. On the walls are lots of reclaimed wood, everyday Thai objects and twinkling lights.  The tables aren't quite level but who cares!  All this along with the very personable staff adds to the overall warmth of the place.The food is great; best of what Thai home cooking is like.  It's amazing to me that all the yummy food comes out of this tiny kitchen behind the counter.  During our visit here we ordered the Basil Fried Rice, Thai Chicken Wings, Beef Pad Thai and the Chicken Sate appetizers.The Pad Thai was lighter in color, less sweet and less oily than what I'm used to.  Nevertheless, this was quite tasty. The Basil Fried Rice was another delicious dish.  It was more on the mild side and had only a tiny bit of a kick.  And the Chicken Sate was delicious!!  I only wished I ordered two!  It had a nice grilled meat aroma and was very tender.  This was by far my favorite dish during this visit.  The Thai chicken wings were okay.  They were really just fried chicken wings with the sweet and sour dipping sauce. For drinks, we got a mango slush and a strawberry slush.  Both were a little too sugary for me but was okay.  For dessert, we got the mango sticky rice.  This was a nice way to end the meal with.  The mangoes were perfectly ripe, and I liked that they give you the full mango (minus the pit).  At some restaurants I've been to, they only give you half of the mango.  They paired this with purple sticky rice.  The rice was soaked in coconut milk.  And the color contrast with the very ripe mangoes was very pleasing to the eyes.    I would definitely come back again to try more of their menu. Tip: Cash only but order through Yelp for pick up and pay with credit card."

I am not sure how long it will be around, as it is in an out of the way location two blocks south of Queens Blvd.We ordered several different plates of pad thai and pad see ew, with different kinds of meat and tofu. We also had some of their shao mai and Thai iced tea. The food itself tasted great. With it being a small, family run spot, the food is cooked with good flavor and seasoning. However, the portion sizes were very small. I have had Thai food in this part of Queens that is just as good for the same price - with a portion that is 50% larger than here. It was very noticeable as soon as they brought the plates out. In fact, the ""chicken"" pad thai had very little chicken and had a huge amount of egg in it - to make up for the lack of meat?"

I get it medium and it's just enough so  u can still taste the wonderful Thai herbs and flavors with a little kick. For dessert our go to are the Nutella banana and fresh fruit crepes. My husband can eat 3 of these for his meal alone. What's wonderful about this place also is that it is a mother and daughter chef team that take great pride in their food.  I will never order from any other Thai place in my area again as long as this place exists.

The dining area is small so it's definitely not made for large group gatherings, but is suitable for groups of up to 4 people. I got the Shrimp Tom Yum, which was mildly spicy and reminded me of a Singaporean laksa.  I'd recommend this if you like coconut milk based broth.Papaya salad was super spicy, even though we requested mild, but it tasted fantastic! We also had it modified due to my friend's allergies to shellfish (used soy sauce instead of fish sauce). Even with the modification, it tasted pretty similar to a regular papaya salad.Lychee thai tea was refreshing and not too sweet, which I liked. Other things to note: - They serve snacks in the range of $1-$3 (french fries, hot dogs, etc.) in the afternoon to cater to the after school crowd (kids, students, etc.).-There's a small unisex bathroom to the left of the counter.- Drink selection is limited on the actual menu, but if you go up to the counter, they have a bigger selection of drinks that you can order from.Hope to return to this place soon to try out the recommended dishes!"

I just wanted a little something so when I saw their menu online and they posted ""avocado fries,"" I thought that sounded good. When I entered the venue it was very dark inside, no air conditioning, 5 patrons at the bar watching horse races, and a bartender who ignored me. A couple minutes later a young woman showed up and the transaction was sealed. Much to my surprise my bill came to 14.00 for 5 small avocado wedges. No shame on me because I won't be back."

This is a two sided bar with a sort of indoor/outdoor beer gardenesque bar on one and a large long bar on the other. When I was there is was packed. We had a blast and a few of my friends got rowdy and danced on ledges. Beers were appropriately priced and surprisingly the bartenders were fast and on top of everything. I liked the atmosphere as there was a fire place and homey decor. There were three bathrooms, one labeled unisex, which I thought was super progressive for the area. Staff was great, music was fantastic. Cops shut the music down but hey, it happens. I'd go back if I was in the area for sure!"

I just want to try everything.Highly recommend this quick casual spot for noodles and rice bowls. This is classic Taiwanese street food done right (and in Bayside).  About time! You order on a kiosk and pay via credit card. If you prefer to pay cash, you can order at the counter for that. There's about four standard tables and a few high top seats with a view of the outdoors. Recommendations from the starters menu:- Taiwanese sausage with the raw garlic - love this appetizer. The raw garlic really compliments the sausage. Good flavors.- Pork Belly buns with peanuts and cilantro - the peanuts and sauce, takes this pork belly bun to the next level. Very tender and tasty. - oyster pancake - not many places make this dish so it's a rare treat to see it on the menu. Comes in an omelette form and has a wiggly jelly like texture. The red sauce is delicious (not spicy but you can ask to make it spicy when you order on the kiosk).Entrees:- Pork cutlet over rice is excellent. Crispy pork is well seasoned and has a good crunch in each bite. The meat is tender and juicy. The accompanyments are very good too (soy sauce egg and preserved mustard greens with a hint of spicy peppers). - Pork belly over rice - it's a classic dish. Comes with a soy sauce egg and mustard greens as well. There is a hint of soy sauce drizzled over the rice as you mix the bowl. - Ja Ja Myeng (tofu, sliced vegetables and bean sprouts). Crowd favorite.- Noodle soup with intestines, the broth here is rich and flavorful. Not a fan of intestines but my friend said it was authentic.Drinks I've tried: Lemon Au Yu jelly and the kumquat lemon green tea. Both were delicious.A must try either to go or for a quick bite."

We got their chicken cutlet on rice as well as some of their braised pork rice to go (this restaurant has very limited seating so most of the orders are going to be take out).The chicken cutlet was seasoned well but their braised pork rice needed a lot more seasoning (the sauce was watery). I'm sure the food would've tasted a lot better had we eaten it on the spot but we had to take it to go. Worth going to try and will likely do an update once I have a chance to try more of their menu."

I got the Rice Noodle Soup with Intestines, and it was very good! Not a lot of intestines but just the right amount imo. The whole broth was very peppery, which I guess is a hit or miss depending on the person. We also got popcorn chicken, which was good. My fiancée got chicken over rice and my brother in law got pork over rice, gosh the chicken was fried perfectly. Would recommend coming here!"

She's tired, she wants to watch TV and listen to music. Maybe take dance lessons, not slave away in the kitchen for your amusement. Who ever is in the kitchen is doing a damn good job! And you let them keep cooking. The food here is great! The pork chop over rice? Yes! Get it! Get it! Not over fried, still juicy inside. And it's a decent amount!  Even Homer would be proud!I got the beef noodle because it's a classic dish. I was not disappointed. It's flavorful and tasty. I enjoyed it. No it's not the same as that place on the side of the mountain in Taiwan but you're just going to have to get over that. Got the kumquat drink, it wasn't too sweet and you could taste the kumquat more than anything. Oyster pancake is another classic. The texture was amazing. Chewy and gelatinous the way it's supposed to be. Yes there are oysters in there but not the huge ones you see at the raw bar. No bathroom so you'll have to go to Starbucks.

We had the fried salt & pepper chicken cutlet over rice (spicy), braised beef noodle soup, taiwanese milk tea, and thai tea, and everything was so delicious. The fried salt & pepper chicken cutlet over rice was my personal favorite as the chicken was crunchy, moist, juicy, and tender all in one bite and perfectly seasoned too. Besides the chicken itself, there were plenty of accompaniments as well, and the pickled mustard greens in particular stood out and enhanced the overall flavor of this dish. Definitely a must-try spot for some comforting Taiwanese food. Can't wait to come back and try some of the other menu items!"

They provide a wholesome meal that comes with crisply cooked vegetables. There may be a premium for that but this day in age we're just used to paying more. The chicken sandwich was solid and had a great crunch. The salt and and pepper porkchop also was pretty good for what I expected. My only disappointment was the milk tea as it tasted rather bland and it clearly is just made in huge batches and then stored in the fridge. Bonus is the parking lot which makes it easier to pick stuff up but theres only one entrance to the lot which is kind of annoying.

The savory sticky rice was really good as well, I just wished they didn't add the sauce on top of it. Overall, I will come back again to try the other stuff on the menu."

The quality of the ingredients is also very good! Vegetables taste good and fresh. There are also vegetarian options which is great when I'm skipping meat.

The flavor is good, but I really hate soggy chicken. The rice is superb, best takeout rice I've ever had! The wings are good as well, but keep in mind they aren't hot wings. Just regular wings with no sauce on them. What drew me in was the fact they they are halal and dont use MSG. Maybe it's best for takeout"

I grew up in ridgewood and live closer to Elmhurst now and I was craving ""brunch"" with my boyfriend. Honestly it's so hard to find a brunch spot now that does anything different because it's all the same thing, they slap on a breakfast burger, eggs Benedict and call it a day. I guess Transplants eat that up now and it's really hard finding really good breakfast and lunch nowadays. I literally found this on a whim on Google and the Sopes sold me. I ordered the hot chocolate and my boyfriend did the cinnamon cold brew. Our waiter was such a sweetheart and super attentive. My hot chocolate came with a ""show"", my marshmallow was nicely torched and my whipped cream was delicious. I do wish my hot chocolate came with cheese but that's just me being Colombian  . It was delicious and wish I ordered a second one. My boyfriend ordered the Chilaquiles Verdes con Chorizo and I did the regular Sope con todo. Both were amazing. I'm not a big fan of Chilaquiles at restaurants, they're so easy to mess up but wow, I was definitely jealous that I didn't order them. They were flavorful, savory, crispy, and delicious. Even with all the sauces and creams, they held their Crispiness. My Sope was amazing. My boyfriend made a comment about our food beating the food we had in Texas and I laughed because of how true it was (To my New York/Colombian palette, no one come at me). Please come support the small location. It's small but comforting, the decoration is cute and the music was dope to listen to. If you love Mexican Indie-Rock, please come here. Also the service here is wonderful, love the care and attention to customers. Please tip nicely and wish the staff a happy new year."

It's a pretty small place -- so make sure you call in for a reservation if you're planning to go on a weekend. There's usually one host that doubles as your server, and about 1-2 people in the kitchen. On a busy day, the host understandably can't get to you as often, but if you come on a lighter day/time, the service is unlike anything I've experienced. Our server that day probably came to fill up our waters/coffees about 8 times, and was overall incredibly attentive and kind.And the food? AMAZING!!! Each place is clearly made with such detail, and their specials are absolutely incredible. I've gotten the dope twice now -- it's the perfect combination of a starch (fried masa), protein (chorizo -- which I haven't liked in the past, but it is delicious here...), vegetables, and dairy (tons of sour cream) on top! The Chilaquilles were HUGE, had really well seasoned tender meat, and a spicy cut up tortilla base.The hot chocolate was wonderful - presentation was gorgeous; as the waiter brought the cups out, he toasted the marshmallows on fire. Latte was also good, and their hot coffee came with free refills and sugar/sweeteners on the side.Already looking forward to my next visit here!"

Every now and then, you have to treat yourself to ""breakfast for dinner"". I visited this IHOP on an early Friday evening, around 6pm. Initially, the service was a hot mess. I believe that  there were maybe 15-18 people among 5 tables and two waiters, but the service was mindbogglingly slow. I had my menu for about 16 minutes before the waiter came over to take my order. At one point, I was about to leave because my hangery levels were approaching 100%. However, once I placed my order the food came out pretty fast. I had a basic waffle with the Tuscon omelette. I honestly do not know what made the omelette ""Tuscon"" but it was edible, nonetheless. I cannot really comment too much about the food, because you kind of already know what to expect when you visit IHOP. Aside from the initial service issue, this location is pretty decent. I have a feeling that I will return in the near future. Shoot, I may go there after work tonight. ;)"

So what if your waitress forgot about you for the last 15 minutes of your visit, They've got pancakes! So what if you had to send back your bacon because it was cold, They've got pancakes! Do you get what I'm trying to say? No you may not always get he five star treatment here but that's not why you come to IHOP! You come here for the pancakes!

When we want pancakes and do not feel like making them we come to this location, usually ordering online and picking it up. Pre-Covid, the wait to pick up sometimes can stretch from 20 mins to close to 45 mins so I learned to place the order and set pick up time to the soonest time available as there is probably additional wait time to that. I came to pick up breakfast on Fathers day and since theres no indoor seating, I suspected that a lot of people were going to order for pickup. Between people ordering in person, online or through delivery services, I was positive the wait time was going to be longer than usual so from the time I ordered, I gave it at least 40 minutes before heading over to pick up the food. We had to line up whether you were ordering in person, picking up or whatever but luckily for me, my order was ready when I gave the name for pickup! I did hear a lot of people complaining they've waited over an hour (these were the folks who probably ordered in person). Anyway, their pancakes are always very fluffy and I love my blueberry compote on top!"

An hour later they ""couldn't reach us"" and they're system crashed so another hour to wait on top of that. We had to leave."

I ordered the gluten free aloo papri chaat which is labeled gluten free on the menu, put ""gluten free"" in the comments, and even called them on the phone to confirm that this dish is gluten free, and either they lied or messed up the order. I could tell a few minutes after eating it that I had made a mistake and now am in severe pain. The last time I felt like this right after a meal I had symptoms for months. I really wish restaurants wouldn't label things ""gluten free"" unless they're able to take it very seriously. Learn from my mistake, people."

I stopped in for a late-ish to-go order, around 9:30 PM and ordered the Aloo Papri Chaat and Dal Makhani. The Chaat was cold and the potatoes weren't cooked all the way through and the Dal was so spicy your head would explode. Now, I LIKE SPICE - I even like it when it burns my tongue a little but not to the point where my whole mouth and palette is blown out for days. Both items were totally inedible, which sucks on multiple levels: 1) I didn't eat dinner and 2) I had to toss food in the garbage and 3) I won't ever go there again. It was that upsetting. I used to really like this place. :o(  Bummer."

I made a reservation in advance but honestly don't think it was needed around 6:30pm. They had plenty of indoor and outdoor seating separated by plexiglass. They even required one person fill out a card with information for contact tracing. Unfortunately they're not doing happy hour right now but their cocktails were around $13-15 and bottles of wine around $40. We ordered some beers, cocktails, and bottles of wine and had a great time! The fried chicken sandwich is a must. 4 people in our group ordered it and were all in agreement that it was amazing. The bread was buttery and soft and perfectly complemented the spicy mayo coleslaw and fried chicken."

I enjoyed the Austin East Cider ($6 for happy hour) & my boyfriend enjoyed the bit burger beer ($5 for happy hour). We had a great time and enjoyed the French fries as an appetizer. Great service as well. I love their emphasis on accessibility! We will definitely go back.

I informed the server that I did not like yellow cheese and asked for white cheddar or any white cheese. The server said she would check with the kitchen. The server did not return and when the burger arrived, it had yellow cheese on it. The burger was flat, with a thick cut of tomato and thick cut of onion on a cold bun. Which was a shame, because the burger was tender and nicely seasoned. I asked the server for mayonnaise that never came, so after waiting about 4 or 5 minutes without seeing the waitress return, I just ate the burger. Also, when taking the order, the server asked if we wanted fries with the food and we said no. When the food arrived, it included fries. When I summoned the server and told her we did not order fries, she responded ""You don't want the fries?"". When I responded ""no"" for not the third time she said ""Okay, I'll take it off the bill."" We never received any utensils and the bottle of water on the outdoor table was unopened.i acknowledge that the place was busy but the service could have been better."

And this was the ONLY place whose kitchen was open in the Village on a Tuesday night around 10-11PM (I'm sorry but that means the city isn't back yet).But the food here was actually awful. I understand this is a bar/gastropub and the food list is short. I ordered the mac and cheese. This was not mac and CHEESE. This was plain noodles. Honestly, mac and cheese from a box with powder cheese is better. Even in the dark bar, it looked unappetizing. Maybe the other food is decent but I just came here to say DO NOT GET THE MAC AND CHEESE. And for a bar, the drinks were pretty average. I got the Concrete Jungle. I'm sure if you live nearby, and wanna grab a beer, it's a great place."

Needless to say, I always love a free meal so I proceeded to make my way to the Chick-fil-A on Fulton Street. Due to Covid they closed their dining area. You have to wait on line to order with the staff in front and pick up your food at the end. There is also a pickup window for those who ordered online.This was my first time here so I did not know the usual process. I told the staff in front this is my first time here to which they replied ""Really?!"" I guess I must be one of the only people in New York City who have not tried Chick-fil-A yet haha. Well there is a first time for everything. I picked up my chicken sandwich and ordered a side of waffle fries. Everything came out delicious. I only wished there was an area to sit down and properly enjoy my food. I ended up eating most of the waffle fries in the bag on my way home. I sat down quickly and ate the sandwich because I was so hungry. Needless to say I did not end up getting any good photos of the food. I will come by again hopefully when everything is open to go for round 2!"
1863,n8p5g3-Fu1RBKx35QhiaXg,6/23/2022,3 star rating,I don't get what all the hype is about this place. They serve average chicken sandwiches that are a little pricier than they should be and a little more homophobic than they should be.

Later, I found out that people really like their sandwiches and decided to give then a try, inspite of their corporate beliefs. I came during lunch time, so of course there was a bit of a long line. Surprisingly it moved pretty quick. I ordered a deluxe sandwich and in less than a minute a guy was calling my name. Staff is super friendly and there's even a guy at the entrance who opens the door for you. I Love their condiments station, especially their ketchup. Place looked very clean too. I didn't check the seating upstairs though. The flavor: sandwich was very well prepared for a fast food place. Tomatoes and lettuce was very fresh and chicken was nicely cooked."

They made a big splash when they opened their first location in the East Village and that was the first time I had even heard of bone broth.  Recently my health conscious coworkers discovered it and have been drinking it for it's health benefits. To be frank, that's not a reason I eat food, I only care that it tastes good. So I went along just for that reason and couldn't tell you anything else about it.I ordered two small soups: the Texas two step and the Spicy Nonna. Texas is beef broth with bone marrow, and while it's tasty enough I think it would work better as a base for something else. The Spicy Nonna was amazzing, spicy without being overpowering, flavorful,  bright. Still though, its broth.  And those two small containers cost me $17. There's no chunks of things in there, I could maybe drink this as a very light breakfast but it's not filling by any means. It can help as an appetite suppressant,  I can see it being nice if you're trying to lose weight. But man, Hale and Hearty is close by and I see myself going there instead."
1872,a0oAiB0itLNQ8E1_GY5_lw,1/30/2018,4 star rating,"The broth here is out of this world. Truly the best meat broth I have ever tasted. I have never tried the veggie, but I am sure it's just as delicious. You can add some fun elixirs to any of the broths like a turmeric shot, butter and more. For me, the only downfall to this joint is that there is nowhere to sit. I know it's a on the go type of place, but it'd be nice to have even just one or two small tables as an option."
1873,a0oAiB0itLNQ8E1_GY5_lw,1/21/2019,4 star rating,Brodo is a sick persons dream. They have variety of bone broth options with amazing mix ins served at a perfect temperature in a sippable coffee cup conducive to the on the go New Yorker lifestyle. This location is counter service only with no seating. I wouldn't recommend having this if your hungry because you will still be hungry after but I would recommend if you're in need of some healthy soup! I loved the chicken broth with the lemon garlic ginger add on.

I had some leftovers so put it in the frig and noticed that the broth doesn't gel up AT ALL...doesn't even look as thick as my amateur broth when I make it. Any well made bone broth should gel (just google it). Otherwise, it means you're not actually getting any of the vitamin and minerals you think you are - it comes with the collagen. Basically this is a low quality good tasting broth with veggies. I called the shop and they said they were surprised it doesn't gel but don't know how exactly how the soup is made so gave me an email to which I asked my question but never heard back from Brodo! For a bone broth that claims to have health benefits and sold at such a high price point, it should at the minimum gel up in the frig. I never would have known had I not put it in the frig so you might want to TEST YOUR CUP OF BROTH!"

Bought the books, cruelest over making it at home and then, I found Brodo. I love the options, although expensive (as others mentioned 2 small soups are almost $20). However, it's a treat. The Spicy Nonna is yummy, and I like the Texas too... they're amazing options. When I don't have the time to make it, or don't feel like thawing it from the freezer, this is a ""go to"" spot. Keep it up."

I've frequented that locations multiple times (even in the heat of summer!) but this is my first time at the west village location. Same deliciously deep and complex broths, now with house-approved combinations.Favorite broth- beef ($7 for small). Can taste a slight sweetness of carrots and spice of ginger that rounds out the full savoriness of the beef-based brothHave also tried the hearth broth, which is a mixture of turkey, chicken, and beef. Also savory but not quite as rich as the beefSpicy nonna ($8 for small)- is wonderfully spicy and extra rich with marrow and chili. You essentially get a small discount for both these toppings compared to getting them separately.This is definitely a larger space than the EV location as there is actually standing room inside, but still small. Minus 1 star only because I felt that the broth is a little more flavorful at the original location for the same price but it perhaps just needs some time to mature. Still my favorite place for broth!"

We got some comp dishes and I really like the private booth seats with drapes and all. The art on the wall gives great personality to the place and sorta transports you away from Brooklyn and to some faraway place you only read about.I gave it a 4 star rating cuz there was no AC.

Old Baku was recommended to me, by somebody that shares my love of grilled meats. You walk in the door, nobody is there, DONT let this turn you off. You must persist! Walk in, towards the back. Eventually somebody will welcome you. Everything we had was very good, the ""dolmas"" which we had were eggplant, tomato and pepper, all excellent! The star of the show was for sure the grilled meats. Of which we had the chicken, beef and ground lamb. Damn, this place is a hidden gem. Everything is cooked over a wood fire. Don't let the lack of reviews turn you off, don't let the lack of anybody in the front turn you off, or don't go, and it will remain the fantastic hidden gem this place remains."
1902,cAcazXWgluB_2-n0KbDQXQ,11/15/2015,3 star rating,I hate that they are cash only... despite that I really wanted to love it...espc since it's byobAt first you walk in and it's a bunch of booths ....but if you keep going you will see an open galley  kitchen ...just beyond which is a great outdoor spot for spring or summer ... to the right is a fire pit for grilling and to the left three doors 2 of which are private seating and the third an arcade. Just beyond that is the family style seating. I loved the decor and if it was one of the warmer months which for November it's amazing but not enough for me to sit in the back area without heat. Although the space beyond the courtyard is enclosed it's too cold to take off your jacket. They claim to have heat but they never turn it on. The bread is delicious and hot when it arrives.Next the eggplant salad flavorful but not impressiveThe grape Leaves were excellent 9 in totalThe balls for kebabs were out yet the ones with home fries they had - I found this oddEither way that was a really good dish very tender too.The lamb ribs were super fattyThe chicken kebab seemed undercooked to me The red sauce was not great a bit bland And the fries were unique Def not Idaho potatoes maybe the blue or yucca style couldn't quite place them still good thoughSis felt it was all too salty

1904,cAcazXWgluB_2-n0KbDQXQ,3/19/2019,3 star rating,The chicken was very flavorful it needed to be cooked just a little bit more for my taste buds but nonetheless it was good. I like to fluff my rice. They were two different color rice which I'm not sure of the reason why I would hate to think that yesterday's Rice versus today's rice however it was very good. I like that they use fresh onions something about fresh red onions help to bring flavor to just about anything. I will return next time with a couple of friends and see what they say. On the outside you would never know it's depth. In the beginning coming into this establishment it seems as though the lady was apprehensive. As I begin to walk towards the back or eyes followed me.

I settled on a drink because the indoor seating was starting to get filled up. I got the brown sugar milk tea in large.

Also there is a banister near the pool table which makes it hard to make every shot on that side. Otherwise this place has plenty of alcohol but doesnt service food! It also has 2 bathrooms but they r hard to notice. I would recommend not comming here if you can help it, because there r much much better places to play pool or drink some alcohol all over the 5 burroughs."

In a neighborhood full of cheap eats and cell phone shops, an Irish Dive Bar is a refreshing find.They have a pool table and some games, but mostly a long bar and cheap beer. It's dark and smells like cleaning agent and last nights spills, but that is really what you are looking for in a good dive.Regulars seemed to know each other and seemed nice, but our group did not interact with the natives."

I'm a 27 year old female, alone, and no one is trying to make casual conversation with me - I like that. A good spot to go when Duanne Reade tells you to come back in 30-45 minutes to get your prescription. They have a jukebox which is currently playing some terrible 80's pop butI suppose I could put something else on if I so chose to.Hey, cheap booze, jukebox, clean bathrooms, pool table, and no one is trying to shoot the shit with me. Excellent."
1930,graCalOReFFFOaC0febodw,6/19/2014,5 star rating,Aaaw yeah.  A real old-school dive bar in the heart of an incredibly multi-ethnic part of Queens.  Get drunk off your butt for a few bucks alongside a model UN of people from all over the world and from all walks of life.  There aren't many places like this left in the city; grab this one in while you can.  Get blasted here and then go eat momo from one of the 6 momo trucks around the corner.

Yes, I might be developing lactose intolerance, but I don't feel this way from Kung Fu Tea. Also, I really don't like how I have to walk to the E 14th St Vivi just to get a better price on the snacks. With such close proximity, it would make sense to have the same prices--as opposed to a Vivi store located in East New York, for example."

I cannot taste the float at all. It literally tastes like cold earl gray... The bubble is kind of overly sweet as well. And because they won't let you use cards unless it is above $5. I have to get a large instead of a medium... Oh great... The only nice thing is that the cashier and the person who makes the drinks are both kind of cute haha!"

I've found that Vivi's bubble tea is usually more diluted than other places so I always ask for no ice. I also don't like their fruit teas BECAUSE it's so diluted. However their normal milk bubble tea is still good and you can get a free upgrade if you check in on yelp!

Lactose-free milk, a nice touch.I noticed the checkin offer after we'd paid, and, without needing to, the guy behind the counter retroactively applied the upgrade by giving us back $1.Free wifi.Other boba chains get more hype and crowds, but I find Vivi to deliver a reliably good experience."

1939,E7bXW2tsCV4c8WCeeV8z_g,11/1/2017,5 star rating,"My new favorite drink that you can only get here is Peach (pulp) with lychee jelly. It's light, sweet, and fruity. The pulp really gives it a strong peach flavor - ahhh~ reminds me of Summer :)Another drink I really like here is Jasmine and Honey Green Tea with Aloe for something that is light, and healthy! Taro Slush is usually my go-to bubble tea. My favorite place to get it is KFT but this is definitely a close second.They serve sushi/onigiri/popcorn chicken here. I haven't tried it from this location specifically but definitely look forward to trying it one day."

I've only tried the tea but I can say it was satisfying. We walked in and the lady had her head down so I had to ""announce"" our presence. There was no other customers there so I don't see why I had to greet myself first. I guess I'm just used to that down south? However she was very sweet and soft spoken. There were several appealing flavours advertised so I chose the tiramisu tea. It. Was. Delicious. Very smooth, and i definitely indulged. It was warm as well! Normally I get cold teas or smoothies so this was a surprise. The boba balls were sweet and gooey, just how I like it. I want to stop by again before I leave since I've been wanting one daily!"

Both were good but I preferred the Up Tini as the lychee was a bit too sweet. For food, the pad Thai and pad see-ew took the cake for best options. The green curry was recommended by our waiter -- it was good but nothing crazy to me. For apps, the spring rolls & dumplings. The dumplings were better than the spring rolls.

The drinks were so amazing, I love the lychee Thai ice tea the most! The dessert was perfect! Mango mousse cake and ice cream! Yes please! The taro coconut sticky rice was decent too! My favorite was the mousse cake! The appetizers were also delicious, the chicken wings so crispy and the mussel soaked in Thai chili and lemongrass broth! Everything was so flavorful and tasty!

For a Friday night, it was very busy and we had to book a reservation ahead of time. As an appetizer, we tried the crispy spring rolls (3 for $9), which were delicious! They had lots of vegetarian filling including mushrooms, cabbage, glass noodles, etc. and paired well with the plum sauce. For a drink, I got a passion fruit mojito -- there wasn't that much of a passion fruit flavor, but it still tasted good.I got the Nam Tok ($22) as an entree, which included grilled sliced top sirloin with dressing over greens and sticky rice. The meat was a bit cold and on the tougher side, but it had a nice spicy flavor. I probably wouldn't get this again, but would come back to try some of the other entrees even if they are on the pricier side."

The basil fried rice was also. 5/5, would definitely have again. The padthai was a bit disappointing as It was dry and just not as authentic. Mango wasn't in season so we had the tarp sticky rice and BAM. Hit the spot! In love with this place!!"

(Do note that you only have 10 minute to show up with your whole party before they cancel your reservation.)  The exact time of our reservation we were called and were taken to our table. When you first walk in, it looks like a small restaurant, but when you go inside, it's a beautifully decorated, specious restaurant.  The food and customer service was just fantastic.  I ordered the Lychee Thai tea and the UP Thai Fried Rice Claypot.  It was just delicious to the last bite.  It was very flavorful.  Your tastebud will thank you!  Highly recommend getting the Claypot.  With the amount of food you get, the price is worth it.  Highly recommend this place."
1947,wLXLrpQrPAZeUG7nd8MInw,11/11/2022,5 star rating,"Since I always walked around this place and saw it completely packed no matter the day or hour I decided to give it a try and I was pleasantly surprised by their beautiful interiors, attentive and fast service and delicious food. Price wise I would consider it reasonable compared to the other Thai restaurants in the area. We didn't have a reservation but we were assigned a table in about 5 minutes after being added to the waiting list, a lot of pick up orders and people waiting outside, that at first glance felt a bit overwhelming but we were seated almost immediately after putting our names down so don't let the line discouraged you because their service is fast and the interior to my surprise pretty big.For food we had Hoi Jor (Deep fried tofu skin stuffed with ground pork, shrimp and crab meat, served with plum sauce), the chicken wings, panang curry with shrimp and lemongrass pork chops with sticky rice. Everything was amazing but the Penang curry was outstanding. Will definitely come back to eat this again and again.For drinks we had their Thai draft lager and a lychee martini, the beer was good and the lychee martini delicious, it could have been colder imo, but the balance within alcohol, sweetness and lychee was perfect. Service was amazing and cared to offer recommendations and explanations of a lot of items in the menu since we told them it was our first time and their menu is quite extensive. They do take reservations unlike other Thai places in the area, and offer weekdays lunch specials ($15-$20) for three courses.I would definitely recommend and would be happy to come back again.Ps: they have a very nice bar inside with comfortable seating, music was also good, so it might also worth a visit if you are interested just in drinks (the have a good house selection) if you grab a spot at the bar."

1953,-OixbLnFLCzQclxCSbUQ8w,11/19/2022,2 star rating,"Marked as Korean ""fusion"" or like ""modern American-Korean"" but I found the flavors and experience to be rather disappointing. The flavors felt extremely heavy and just tasted like heavy American food with Korean names. Like their infamous burger was just a straight up cheeseburger. Their tots were so sweet and soaked in the ""honey butter"" topping. It was too much and didn't taste like korean honey butter? Tasted too heavy and sweet?I also got some breakfast sandwich, with egg and ham. Literally just tasted like an american breakfast sandwich.I don't know. Perhaps I came with the wrong expectations, but the flavors and the textures and style of food was so far from typical Korean food - that it didn't feel like a ""good"" Korean fusion to me at all. Tasted so American. Especially since the interior is decked out to look like a hip Korean pocha like you'd find in Itaewon or something. If you're just looking for a nice vibe though with hearty food, this is a good spot for that!"
1954,-OixbLnFLCzQclxCSbUQ8w,9/30/2022,4 star rating,"This restaurant has such a lively and energetic vibe! We walked in on a Friday evening and managed to get bar seating without a reservation. We ordered the chopped cheese rice cakes; I had very high expectations for these given the glowing reviews, but they were pretty average IMO. The standout was definitely the tofu sando; I'm not really in love with tofu but I was in love with this sandwich. The tofu was perfectly breaded, and there were crunchy & crispy bits loaded in the sandwich that made every bite amazing! We also ordered some drinks but they were tiny for the price.The bathroom has a disco ball and kpop blasting. Overall a great spot for Friday / weekend dinner!"
1955,-OixbLnFLCzQclxCSbUQ8w,3/5/2023,4 star rating,"Great place for meeting up with friends! The restaurant is pretty small so the tables are intimately close but everyone is very mindful about keeping the noise level down. Most menu items are on the smaller, tapa like sizes so my friends and I started off with the truffle rice cakes and honey butter tots. The truffle rice cakes reminded me of a pasta dish and was actually very filling and the tator tots were crispy with a subtle hint of honey butter favor. I got the chicken wings appetizer as my entree and was very full! They give you 4 huge pieces that are perfectly crispy, juicy, and flavorful alongside little pickled radish and dill leaves. Pretty expensive in my opinion but overall, a great upscale Korean restaurant!"

There is some culinary wizardry happening with these things + Healthy baby gem salad - great + Legendary burger - awesome + Crispy tater tots with honey butter - second best thing we ate Service was fantastic. Definitely will return!"
1959,-OixbLnFLCzQclxCSbUQ8w,1/15/2023,3 star rating,"Seems that this has blown up and has hit the tipping point. Portion sizes are waaaay down, prices are still the same. Really disappointed because this spot used to be doing everything right. Food is still good, but after seeing the new portion sizes can't really justify stopping by here anymore. Burger and chicken sandwiches are still great and would def recommend checking this place out, but if you used to come here a lot and it's been a while since you had it, you will notice the changes.See the photos I uploaded. Chopped cheese rice cakes have been reduced in size by, about 50-60% smaller than when they first opened. Was expecting the usual portion and was beyond disappointed when I received this.Ricotta toast as well, three small pieces of toast (the ricotta is the star obv, but still, not enough toast) but the ricotta portion has also been reduced."
1960,-OixbLnFLCzQclxCSbUQ8w,9/1/2022,4 star rating,"Nice little bar with an interesting bathroom (seriously, the bathroom felt more like a dance club than the actual bar itself - disco ball and everything).Server was personable and helped us choose drinks/food. Cocktails are decent, nothing too extraordinary - at least the ones we got weren't super instagrammable compared to other cocktail bars I've been to! Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture of those. :((Spicy) Fried chicken was delicious - sticky and crispy on the outside, hot and juicy on the inside - and came with blue cheese. Portion that came out was a lot smaller than I was expecting for the price though, so you might be a bit disappointed"
1961,LMyvruexOQzzHQrAgbdqiA,1/18/2018,5 star rating,Can't be happier than this !! Gongcha near 8th ave !? It's about time that one has opened One of my favorite drinks are the honey green tea (for my green tea lovers that can't stand the bitterness. This is for you!) and the original milk tea and green milk tea both are amazing. Both have their own unique taste ! Definitely try their other concoctions I've been here countless times since opening and it is never disappointing.
1962,LMyvruexOQzzHQrAgbdqiA,11/2/2019,3 star rating,"Would prefer this place for bubble tea. Sugar and ice can be adjusted. However, some of the cashiers just gotta get their ears checked like they just don't understand what your order is. More like they are all Asians and have a heavy accent. I'm Asian myself but still they can't get my order correct. Overall, I would still go back once in a while for the drinks because it does taste good. J"

I had the milk foam earl grey, milk foam oolong tea and lemon yogurt. The teas were so strong and tasty! I surprisingly enjoyed the lemon yogurt drink as well. I loved that all the drinks did not have the fake powder taste. I have no idea if they use powder or not but I enjoyed the calories from these drinks."

This chain (along with Kung Fu Tea) is my two favorite bubble tea chains in NY. This particular location is rather small (only about two seats) and isn't a sit down spot just a small to-go place, which is a bit of a bummer."

1967,LMyvruexOQzzHQrAgbdqiA,4/13/2018,4 star rating,So glad they finally opened one in Brooklyn! I love the earl grey milk tea and the brown sugar ginger milk tea. I'm reducing one star because the flavor is not consistent. Each time I buy the earl grey tea with 3 Js it tastes different.
1968,LMyvruexOQzzHQrAgbdqiA,3/25/2018,5 star rating,Super excited that they opened a Gong Cha in Brooklyn! The cashier was friendly and patient with us when we ordered. She made sure to ask what sugar level we wanted and double checked that we didn't want toppings. I had the hot oolong milk tea and my friend had the iced lychee oolong tea. Both are recommended! ** No credit card minimum!! **
1969,LMyvruexOQzzHQrAgbdqiA,4/5/2018,1 star rating,"I always have really high expectations of Gong Cha. One of my go to drink place, but this place is a disappointment compared to all the other Gong Cha. I ordered the Strawberry Green Tea one of their new series. I NEVER GOT SO UPSET AT A DRINK BEFORE. One of the worst drink ever. Do not DO NOT get it. I also got the Mango Green Tea with 30% sugar, I cannot imagine if I didn't adjust the sugar. Almost got diabetes drinking it. The workers couldn't even bother to mix the syrup smh. Too busy flirting with her boyfriend on where to go for dinner. Don't go here..."
1970,LMyvruexOQzzHQrAgbdqiA,6/3/2018,1 star rating,"We had an extremely negative experience with this particular location. The employee, Jun, is extremely rude. We ordered our drinks from UberEat and they made a mistake for our order. Therefore we decided to call the store and asked if it's possible to make an exchange. Then this guy, Jun (I'm not entirely sure if it's his real name), suddenly started to scream and curse at my family in broken English, thinking there is no one else on earth who could speak English. Like WTF. That's not the way for you to treat your customers. That's the moment I decided to take over the phone and had a nice little conversation with the guy. But I guess it was a little hard for him to understand English after all."

I really love Japanese everything so the creative Asian style drinks and snacks are totally up my alley. The matcha latte is phenomenal and I enjoyed trying the blackbird coffee, super creative. The fluffy egg sandwich is quite delicious, but the brownies are a real show stopper. Get the black sesame if you want something more unique.There are benches and a patio outside, as well as a couple of tables indoors.Wheelchair access details-there is a ramp to get on the outdoor patio. There are two steps to get inside. The shop has a call button for assistance and there is a ramp they can bring. I asked if I could just place my order outside since I wanted to sit outdoors anyway instead of using the ramp and they were happy to oblige. Super nice staff."

It's a terrible spot to sit inside. They leave the window open all day even during peak hours winter.

1982,fxi3le9ZoP75Lw51QBG6uQ,8/1/2022,3 star rating,"This little coffee joint was poppin on a Saturday morning. It was recommended by my friend who lives in the area. 3/5 rating is for the blackbird latte, which was recommended by the barista, composed of espresso, blackberries, thyme, housemade almond macademia milk, and sweetened by figs (or was it dates?). As a beverage it was unique, new, and interesting. As a ""treat myself $7 Saturday morning latte"" it was a little disappointing. I didn't get the usual coffee aroma or oils. The drink was a little acidic due to the seeds of the sweetener (cannot remember if it was figs or date), which mellowed out a little once I stirred it with a straw. Just not what I was expecting when I paid $7 for a latte. The store and vibes are cute though, and the outdoor section was perfect on a summer weekend morning. I'd definitely bring a girlfriend by, though I'd probably try another drink!"

Their flavors are unique but super tasty! The macadamia almond milk is amazing, super rich and creamy. They don't go too heavy on the sugar which I appreciate bc I feel like sometimes cafes do their specialty lattes wayyy too sweet. Perfect balance! Also love that they have vegan and gluten free options that are ACTUALLY tasty. The kobocha loaf and berry poundcake were so yummy, didn't miss the gluten or dairy in either pastry!They have indoor and outdoor seating, indoor is a bit limited but outdoor is pretty generous for New York!"

They know how lucky they are. This is one of the best pizzas in NYC.Mother-daughter, but more accurately grandma-momma run pizzeria. They advertise the Best Sicilian Pizza in Town on the window and Best Thin Slice in Town on the menu. And you know what? They may be right. It might even be best in the city. I'm serious.The stools are fun to sit on, the orange plastic chairs take me back to what was the 80s, maybe even the 70s in my mother's womb. Brick walls inside and out, I can feel the oven and the char throughout the room as grandma clips coupons in the corner. Have an order? Don't bother asking her. If she actually talks to you, consider yourself a part of the family.Heroes are made with homemade everything. How am I supposed to choose between a meatball, sausage or eggplant parm? To heat something up not pizza, they don't use aluminum foil like every other pizzeria, they use little metal dishes. Hey, for me that's novelty, but for them, it's how they've done it since 1965.Great prices, real people. Moreover, Real pizza.Opened: 1965Distinction: Mama makes every pie"

I don't know why, but that's the only way their crust stays light and crisp and perfect. So perfect that after years of so much searching, I really do think they make the best slice in the city. But once you take a pie home, depending on how far away home is, the dough becomes tough and chewy, whether re-heated in an oven, microwave, or eaten as is. So don't do that ;)Other things to keep in mind, they sometimes close early if they're having a slow night so call before dropping in. And skip the mushroom slice as they don't use fresh mushrooms."

My friend and I arrived around 1:30 on a Sunday and expected a wait, but we were seated right away. Both outdoor and indoor seating was available, but we decided to sit inside. We had two servers for some reason, and both were sweet and attentive. The biggest disappointment here is that they no longer offer bottomless brunch - I really hope they bring it back! However, they do offer carafes of various cocktails for $24.50, which is actually reasonable. We decided to get a carafe of the W.B. Spritz, which was fantastic. It was like a fruitier version of your classic Aperol Spritz with a hint of grapefruit. The menu says that the carafes serve 5 people, but I think that's a bit of a stretch - we split one easily between the two of us. For food, I got the Breakfast Flatbread and my friend ordered the Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon. Both were delicious (and only $17). The Breakfast Flatbread was massive (I wasn't able to finish it) and messy to eat (the arugula and eggs fall off), but the spices were tasty and the scrambled eggs were very soft. Overall, a reasonably priced and enjoyable brunch but again, I hope they bring back bottomless. Would return!"

Waiter barely acknowledged me and sometimes didn't acknowledge me at all. He would mostly check in with my friend and ask her for updates on her food, etc. It was so cold outside, but they kept the door open throughout our whole dining experience. (We almost felt like we wanted to keep our jackets on at that point. I covered my lower half as well as arms under my jacket because it was cold).  Lastly, at certain points (after we got our food) we saw the waiter blowing his nose/fiddling with his nose at random times while he was behind the bar. But did not wash his hands after. Soooo that was a bit concerning."

I went expecting a normal, if somewhat affordable brunch, but blown away. It's in the East Village and is pretty accessible. The best part is their drinks deal; 2 cocktails for $10 is insane! I wouldn't say that the drinks are very strong, but on the normal, appetizing level. I think this works out for them, because I'm going to order more drinks anyways since they're cheap and to try different things, while still being able to function for the rest of the day. The eggs benedict I got were quite tasty; nothing to write home about, but would definitely get again. I appreciated the service and would definitely be back!"

I had a side of home fries that needed more seasoning and salt overall."

We got the pancakes and French toast and everything came out exactly as we ordered. Brunch carafes were delicious - highly recommend getting the brunch punch. Only criticism was that there wasn't any AC in the spot we were sitting in which made it slightly more uncomfortable but I wouldn't deduct any stars for that.

So my incredible significant other pulled together a birthday brunch for a few friends, and the list kind of kept growing and growing (I mean, who doesn't love brunch, right?). We had a reservation for 11 and 16 ended up showing up..usually that would be an issue for a place as intimate as Jackdaw, but these guys were so cool about it and took everything in stride, from trying to rearrange furniture, to opening up their sidewalk shed just for us to hang in.They were also cool enough to let us prearrange a bottomless brunch, even though its not listed on their menu. And this wasn't a ""OK 2 hours of mimosas and bloody's"" kind of affair. They let us pick anything we wanted off their extensive and really well made brunch cocktail menu for a reasonable price. I, of course, had way to many espresso martini's, but hey I was nice and caffeinated all afternoon. Their food menu is also very well rounded. I went with the salmon poached eggs, which was tasty, and also had a chance to try the burger which was very well put together. The real winner were the homefries, make sure to get a side if your meal doesn't come with them. If I could give this place 6 stars for both the ambiance and the incredible staff I would.

I'm going to say the cocktails that are included in the boozy brunch are actually good. When we went they had a special for cocktails that were included, so we got frozen blood Orange Margaritas and mimosa's. If you go when they have the blood orange drink, I would go with that, very balanced and very tasted! For food, I wanted the brunch salad, it sounded amazing. Burrata, prosciutto and a lemon truffle vinaigrette? Sounds amazing! Only problem is that I'm allergic to Strawberries, which I asked the waitress about. She said there was no strawberries on the salad, it lists ""berries"", but just to be sure I asked for no berries at all. Turns out she didn't write that down and out comes my salad covered in Strawberries. When I point it out to my waitress she seemed to feel bad, and took it back to fix. It took 20+ mins for me to get a new salad. A NEW SALAD. My friends were done with their food by the time I finally got my meal. Even better, half way through I found a berry under some lettuce so I'm think they just pick them off. Had to use my allergy medication just in case. So fun times for me. Wouldn't come back, and wouldn't suggest this place for anyone who might have an allergy that might just be ignored."

I was surprised to hear they did not have their previous bottomless deal - $25 for brunch cocktails. Instead, they have carafes. I recommend the margarita picante - we also got the cucumber collins and could barely taste the alcohol. Overall this definitely isn't as ""boozy"" in my opinion and makes it more of a standard brunch place. The food was quite good and well priced. However, i ordered eggs hollandaise with avocado substituted for salmon, and confirmed this with the waitress multiple times. However, it still came out with the salmon, and by the time i got the correct order my friends were mostly done with their meal. It was very delicious though! The breakfast potatoes were quite good.Fairly satisfying brunch overall and would be happy to come back."

2024,6VkEYaQphDVsWy3C5Sh1Zg,1/19/2022,4 star rating,"Was looking for a solid happy hour near Union Square to meet up with a friend last weekend. Jackdaw kept popping up. Was initially intending to meet another friend possibly here for drinks and dinner earlier in the week but they cancelled for fear of covid. Anyway, they do have an outdoor dining area that's completely enclosed with a sliding door and heaters in case anyone is wondering. But it's sealed shut with no ventilation so you may as well be dining indoors with that concept. The ambiance is really nice though and when looking for specifically cheap deals near Union Square you wouldn't expect such a fancy establishment. Happy Hour deal that runs from 12pm-8pm: What initially suckered me in were the $8 old fashioneds. Um, yes please. It's strong. It's boozy. It's well made. They're not getting pussy with this drink. No cherry here. Made correctly. Founders all day IPA and Pacifico - $5. Mind you these are canned beers. Rose - $10, a Malbec - $8, Pinot Grigio - $8, Rose Sangria - $10, and a Margarita Picante - $8. Not sure if this gets switched up during the seasons but for being fancy beverages in a really nice bar it's a great deal. Weekly specials as well with $2 tacos on Mondays. Didn't try their food is the one hiccup in that it's a bit pricey. Not horrible but not enough that I felt like spending $13-15 on an appetizer. Maybe splitting a flatbread or nachos wouldn't have been a terrible idea. Would I come back? Absolutely. The bartenders were very well attentive. I got served in literally 5 seconds of sitting down which is a rarity these days. I'm a new fan and will remember this spot."

Jerusalem II pizza on avenue J has recently introduced GF pizza to their menu. As cautious parents as we are , we were afraid to experiment. Pizza is always tricky because of cross contamination. But after confirming from the owner they use a separate designated oven, utensils, & wear gloves we were inclined to try it out. They understood our concerns. Hopefully one day they will have toppings but the cheese pizza was a hit. She loved it and had no symptoms whatsoever!! We can only recommend this to anyone who is a celiac or Gluten sensitivity.

I had class next door and and every morning on campus I would walk past smelling all the smells and finally decided to go in and have lunch. I was put into a food coma. If you've ever watched food wars, this is what it was like. I'm not here to debate about what the best ramen is, but I can confidently say that this place has GOOD ASS RAMEN, and definitely the best I've ever had so far. I got Miso Ramen and the set with vegetable curry. It came as a lunch set that was reasonably priced by New York standards(from Chicago). It was brung out pretty quickly and looked mouthwatering. The broth was perfectly cloudy and flavorful and even though I have an onion intolerance I devoured the shaved green onions on top. Everything was PERFECT for me. The pork was A+ and I was stuffed once I finished the ramen. I was regretting ordering so much food, but the minute I tasted the curry I prepared myself to make room for it. I will never forget this feel and the euphoria I felt eating this Ramen. And I can't wait to be on campus again to eat it again."

We literally had to ask for our drinks to be brought out and they came after the appetizers and main dishes had rolled out.

2045,6x36O0p7akyaEQxeaKFbwg,1/10/2023,2 star rating,"Really disappointed by this place. I'm a big fan of other Major Food Group restaurants and this one just didn't impress. Firstly, the decor in this place was lacking. Every other MFG restaurant I've been to has gone over the top with decor, it almost feels like your being transported into a perfectly designed world/setting. The theme is clear and you feel like you're apart of the story they're telling. Dirty French on the other hand very much just felt like a standard hotel restaurant, which I guess in reality it is. The food was also extremely underwhelming. I started off with the Little Gem salad, which was a large serving (definitely enough for 2-4). The dressing almost tasted like a fancy ranch which I enjoyed. The crispy shallots were also a nice touch. This was probably the best thing I consumed, besides the free bread that comes at the start of the meal. For my main course I had the Chicken Persillade and Pommes Louis. The chicken arrived lukewarm, and the sauce had a strange consistency. The flavor was overwhelmingly garlicky, and there wasn't much else to the dish. The chicken had an okay texture but was a little stiff. The Pommes Louis was also unremarkable. The potatoes had a pleasant fatty flavor, but they were inconsistently cooked, some pieces being overly crispy, some soggy. The potatoes also come with garlic sprinkled on top, which didn't seem to incorporate well. It seems like the menu relies heavily into garlic to save the day. The one thing I will give this restaurant credit for it the service. Everyone was super friendly, attentive, and kind. Overall I think there are much better places to have not only French food, but a meal priced this highly in New York. I would not recommend going out of your way for this one."

My husband loved it and said it was some of the best duck he has ever had. I normally don't like duck l'orange bc I usually find the sauce too sweet but have to admit this was cooked perfectly and I was very impressed by the crispy skin. - Roasted duck fat potatoes: There was one left so we snagged it and so glad we did. These were delicious! A must order. - Mushroom millefeuille: one of the best dishes I have ever had in my entire life. MUST ORDER. - Lamb carpaccio: very creative and delicious. Also highly recommend. - free flatbread to start: Free but one of the best things I had all night - Mussels etouffe: still good but maybe my least favorite dish of the night (mussels were very tiny).- Beignets: pretty decent"

Ice cold, even after I moved to the back of the restaurant. Very unpleasant; skyrocketing prices and only decent sushi. Everyone was running around like chickens without heads.  Service horrendous. Waited 10 minutes for water and replacement of my ice cold tempura shrimp roll. VERY SAD!"

After taking a look at the delivery app's reviews online fI noticed that they had an 85% rating on delivery time (not good at all)!Outside of that, the food was ""meh"" to be quite honest. Plus, it looked more like pre-fab sushi you'd pick-up at a local market! There are way too many other sushi joints around to waste your time and money here! I'm out!"
2058,nBkSqOhZMa1A7Yk3q8VPaA,4/6/2022,4 star rating,"Oh I love love their selection of sushi, my new favorite has become the spicy scallop sushi. The spicy tuna is totally better than Nobu. Just fyi. I also loved the rest of the tempuras I tried, along with their gyoza. We had a bottle of Sancerre which was crispy and lovely. Only issue was my friend has been coming to Seki for the past 15 years, and they didn't update their system so it was a little delayed in trying to rsvp, but we did get a spot- outside although we wanted to sit inside. Aside from that, the sushi and maki are amazing. Even the miso soup. I definitely will come again to do an omakase, because those are truly my desire! Definitely try one of these locations out if you love good sushi."

2060,nBkSqOhZMa1A7Yk3q8VPaA,7/27/2021,2 star rating,"Very good sushi BUT be careful, our waitress Ayako was unclear about the fact that our Omakase had completed. It seems that it should have finished after 4 rounds (13 pieces total), because before our 5th round she asked ""would you like sushi or hand roll for your next round?"". Anyone who has tried Omakase elsewhere in the city knows that it's common to have a dish or two within the Omakase where you can select between a couple options, so it was not clear that our Omakase was over. After she brought out the 5th round we decided to clarify and it turns out that rounds 5 and 6 were NOT in fact part of the Omakase. Would have appreciated this to have been stated more clearly. Bill ended up being $170 per person for the sushi subtotal only. Tl;dr make sure you are aware when you are ordering beyond what's included in the Omakase"

However it is not nearly as good as it use to be anymore. Visited May 2021 and the sushi doesn't seem nearly as tasty and fresh as I remember it to be. The seki special is now $52 PP which is not too bad but with other fast sushi options available, I rather have those."

Pretentious atmosphere and extremely overpriced.  After shaming you for not having a reservation, they'll give you a choice of where to sit: either inside their claustrophobic jail cell restaurant, or out on the street restaurant uncomfortably close to another table.  The sushi was mushy and tasted straight from a gas station. I felt sick, especially after seeing the outrageous bill.  Don't be fooled by the fancy rocks and string lights.  Unless you want a parasite, don't come here"
2064,nBkSqOhZMa1A7Yk3q8VPaA,4/14/2021,4 star rating,"Due to COVID their sushi bar is closed. Made reservations for a Friday night at 7:30PM - definitely make reservations. They were a full house! We were seated in their little section in front of the sushi bar, probably the best seats in the house. We opted for 2 Omakases. Their menu ranges from basic take out sushi and cooked foods, as well as different higher quality types of fish. We thought the way they plated the Omakase was a bit odd. Both Omakase pieces were served on one plate, rather than 1 plate a person. The fish quality and rice were definitely up to par with other Omakase spots at the same price point. It's definitely a less intimate and personalized style of Omakase, probably a result of how busy they were. I think they focus less on the Omakase, and more on just volume.  We were able to cater our own Omakase to how many pieces we wanted, it wasn't necessarily a set piece number. Nonetheless, it was worth a try!"

What I lvoe about this place is how they make their dishes healthy and lean hence their name al horno lean. I also love how they make healthy fruit and green smothies.

I only use the al horno website to order and STILL they do not read any of the information on their order tickets.  This time they forgot my water, utensils, and napkins though I clearly indicated the need for them on the order (there is a checkbox if you want utensils). I have to ASK for hot sauce in every order and 95% of the time I get no hot sauce. Imagine a Chinese restaurant not providing any soy sauce...it's ridiculous. I have even gone to the restaurant to complain in person 3 times. Never asked for reimbursement or other compensation for their repeated ineptitude.  The food is good, but I'm done ordering from here because they make me find my own utensils, napkins, hotsauce, and drinks (alllll of which I order and indicate needing) while on the job. Possibly the worst customer service of any restaurant in the neighborhood. Might as well order from Chipotle."

Walked in and the waiter said we can sit where ever we like. He came over shortly after and we ordered right away. We ordered a California chicken sandwich with fries, turkey burger with fries and scrambled eggs with home fries. The 3 of us agreed everything was good!!!!!! Would definitely return because there aren't many 24hour diners left in NYC. My only complaint with this establishment is paying $.25 to use the restroom. I have only seen that on an episode of Martin. And its not even the money I care about, it's the fact that it wasn't really clean. If you're going to charge a fee at least make sure the bathroom is clean. Other than that I would def eat there again. Food was great, prices were decent and the waiter was nice!"

When my husband picked the cake up the day of the party, he said they had a ton of cakes ready for pickup and at first they couldn't find ours, and when they did they'd forgotten to add the inscription on top, so just plan to pick up with a little extra time before your event.

I would not get the cookies again. They were quite dry, but not crunchy - dry and chewy. I didn't love the flavor. I only had a bite or two of each and then had to toss them. I'd give the cookies 1 star. The brookie was much better than the cookies, but they were still off for my liking. They simultaneously had that dry chewy consistency in the chocolate chip cookie dough, while being much more oily and sugary than the cookies, because of the brownie. But after a couple of bites it makes my stomach hurt. And the flavor isn't great. Two stars for the brooke. I haven't tried the pie yet, but will update the review when I do."

Think of the grocery store cupcakes in the bakery section in the 12-pack plastic containers. That's what these were like. Nothing special at all, but you still eat them. If I were to rank the three accessible bake shops in order, buttermilk bake shop would rank third after Mia's and Martha's Bakery.

I don't eat chocolate anything but I tried a slice of this cake. The chocolate is all through the inside and it melts in your mouth. This cake is very rich so have a bottle of water on hand. I Iove to support local businesses and when they treat you like you have value then there's no hesitation when it comes to returning. I will be back to try the cookies. I mentioned to the lady at the window it's a birthday surprise cake. She looked for candles and everything they had to compliment my order; which was DOPE SERVICE to me.

It looked like a nice bakery filled with regular cookies, cakes, and cupcakes, but I didn't think they had anything for me. Then one day this past spring, I happened to pause at their display case against the window and saw they had not one, but two vegan and gluten-free items!I've been getting the vegan & gluten-free chocolate chunk cookie frequently since then. It's one of the better vegan chocolate chunk/chip cookies I've had (because many others are not great). And one day, one of the ladies working there asked me if I could taste the banana in the cookie ... I didn't even think there was banana in it! So then I even had my (non-vegan) roommate taste the cookie, and even though she HATES banana, she said she wouldn't have known there was banana in it if I hadn't told her and really liked it!There's also a peanut butter bar that's vegan and gluten-free ... kind of like a rice krispie treat but with less rice krispies and more of the stuff holding it together, and a super thick layer of chocolate on top. It's delicious (especially if you like peanut butter, like me), but it's quite heavy. I can't eat more than a couple of bites before I have to stop, which I guess is good to have as a treat to last over a few days.The ladies working there are pretty nice, too! And I brought a friend who got a non-vegan cookie and she said that was also really good. I imagine just about everything here is enjoyable. They're all very pretty at the very least.My schedule is wonky now, such that I can't go by there nearly as often as I did earlier in the year, so now I'm constantly craving one of those cookies!"

And they were still warm when we got home!  The bagels are plenty big as well.  I broke out the ruler & scale and these bad boys come in at 4.5"" diameter x 2.5"" thick and weigh in at a whopping 9 oz, over 1/2 pound each!  I can barely get my mouth around it.You can count on us returning for more of that QBD lobster roll and monster bagels!"

Could make 4 meals out of it total. I really enjoyed the grilled cheese and all the items that it was loaded with. I will say the food was really heavy so it doesn't leave you feeling the best lol but definitely a nice comfort food. I'll have to come back to try their bagels!

2111,PKa6XxkvMTVD5gaDbMznNg,10/1/2021,4 star rating,"Let me start out by saying the ABR Grilled Cheese is one of the most fantastic grilled cheeses I have ever had the please of eating. The sandwich is stuffed with an insane amount of cheese, chicken, and applewood bacon between two giant slices of Texas toast! I am genuinely salivating just thinking about it. The reason I took off one star is because honestly speaking, their bagel missed the mark for me. Their slogan is ""Not Just Bagels"" however, I fear they may be neglecting the bagels as they perfect the other insane and delicious items on their menu. The poppy seed bagel was sparse with the poppy seed and the texture was off. It actually seemed more like I was eating a sandwich on a deli roll rather than a bagel. That being said, the sandwich wasn't bad, it just didn't blow my mind the way that grilled cheese did. This is definitely a solid spot and I would totally visit all the time if I still lived in Queens!IG: @newyorkcityfoodie"

Dominique Ansel Bakery created the Cronut...so that Queens Bagels could blow them out of the water (bagel pun very much intended) with their harmony of American breakfast delights: the French Toast Bagel. Powdered sugar kisses the top of a pull apart cinnamon raisin bagel with a slight bagel-y chew and a bottom layer of flavorful sticky cinnamon sugar. Paired with my choice of plain cream cheese, my first bite was akin to experiencing self-transcendence. The two men working at the front were angelically friendly, only adding to the divine quality of bagelry. Count me in as a lifelong customer."

Barista's make a little foam heart in every cup of joe and have been known to sing along to a Beyonce tune if the mood hits them. The coffee is smooth with a nice roasted taste and maybe more traditional- you won't see as many options as a Starbucks- they only offer decaf in an espresso size which you can turn into a latte, but many varieties of vegan milk types which is nice to see. They offer a punch card for a free cup after 10 I think, so don't pass up on that."

Prices are a little high, but comparable to everything else in the Oculus.But let's talk about their iced dirty chai. It is EVERYTHING. Perfect blend of spices, and the espresso sets it off perfectly. Highly recommended.Bonus: they have a punch card! One drink free for every ten. Now that's my type of place."

I waited for 10 mins and then they called my name. Latte was delicious. It is going to my go to place for coffee now.

Upon entry the hostess greeted me right away. The food was tasty and actually pretty good. However the service needs a lot of work. Bartender was not friendly at all. Never smiled. Never said hello. Never asked can I help you or what can I get you. Felt like we had to beg for service. And the drinks were not good.  Just get beer or the sake. The service at the table was rushed. As soon as we sat down 2 minutes later ready to order. Normally prompt service is great. But when we said we need a few minutes literally a minute later another server comes and asks are we ready to order. Followed by another server 2 minutes later. Needless to say that set the tone for the remainder of the dinner. My guests and I really could not just sit and enjoy our dinner. Everything was on warp speed. My 3 stars is strictly for the food so shout out to the cooks.  Next time take out only.

They actually made the food really fast, to my surprise, since they were busy. We ordered kimchi fries, cashew nut chicken, pad see ew, and basil fried rice. We still had a little bit of leftovers.

2128,rYl_R-UILYqA6vYsbNwLsg,4/3/2023,2 star rating,"So my sons wanted to eat some vietnamese food after being in NYC and eating too much American Fare so we decided to go to Obao because it was close to our hotel near Times Square.  We ordered Spring Rolls which were very good and done very traditionally Vietnamese.  We also got the Shrimp Summer Roll which was tasty and the peanut dipping sauce was very good.  My sons had the Pho Bo which was very good and had all the flavors of a well cooked Pho.  However we were disappointed with the last two dishes we had.  The Bun Bo Hue had all the right taste of a good BBH.  However, it came out luke warm to almost cold.  This was the result of them placing all the ingredients in the bowl cold and then pouring the broth in.  This results in the soup being like warm to cold when it's presented.   Great flavors just poor execution.  We also ordered the Basil Fried Rice with Shrimp.  The Shrimp was undercooked and the rice was alittle wet and too sweet.  The wok could have been hotter when the ingredients were added.  This would give it a nice caramelization that would make all the ingredients mesh in a good way.  The Service was attentive and the place had a nice bistro feel and wasn't overcrowded.   I hope this review wasn't too critical.  Being Viet and Asian, I tend to be harder on my reviews of Viet Restauants.  But I hope this review can help them improve their food and make it even better.  Wishing them the very best."

They don't seat incomplete parties so make sure your group gets there on time. There is seating on two levels. Happy hour daily from 11:30am - 6pm.  Seating also at the bar. Tungsten lighting make the ambiance nice but a bit hard to read the menus...Check out the special cocktails - I've enjoyed the Flunk Flink and A Long Winter drinks... Appetizers: Steamed dumplings and spare ribs are very good.Crispy spring rolls are ok.Entrees: Roasted Duck Noodles is so far the favorite dish...very tasty and highly recommend it.

I have passed it all the time in the UES and finally came for dinner with my boyfriend and cousin. I called to make a reservation but they only take reservations for 6pm and 7:30pm but ""may have other openings earlier"". We showed up about 45 minutes early for our 7:30pm reservation and got seated no problem. Not sure why they couldn't just reserve a table for 6:45pm like I asked?The menu is a mix of Italian/American/Mexican/Seafood. All of the food our party ordered was nothing spectacular and seemed overpriced for what we ordered. A small bowl of tater tots for $13?Service was almost TOO attentive and we felt like we were being watched by our waiter the entire time since there weren't many other tables. I realize this was them wanting to clear things when finished/asking if we wanted more.Decor was a bit all over the place - It looked like they were going for a ""JG Melon"" old school vibe but couldn't pull it off and felt a bit tacky.Overall, wouldn't recommend for dinner but the brunch menu looks like a good deal and outside seating looks nice since they are building a new patio!"

The waiter couldn't answer any questions about what the bar could make and no cocktails were on the menu, although the have a full bar. Two members of my party went to the bar to order drinks there and said the bartender didn't seem to be happy to answer their questions. I ordered a spicy margarita, a classic summer drink, the waiter said they could do that. What I got was a margarita with red pepper flakes in it. It was a little funny and honestly not horrible, just not what I ordered and that was not communicated to me. The waiter jokingly said no when we asked for a refill of water but it was a little awkward. Overall, service wasn't very good and my drink was very strange"

He didn't even touch them- I'm sure the mashed potatoes was from a powder. Didn't taste like potato.4) I got fries with my burger and I'm sure the fries were frozen.Overall, for such a poppin place with poor food, poor service and quite expensive for frozen food - just so disappointing. I'm stunned people come here!!! I'm not a food critic so my taste is quite poor and I was shocked. That says something The set up and street decor is amazing. I will end on that note."

If you want better food & service just cross the street to 5 napkin burger. Please don't waste your time or energy here.On top of the horrible service the food was disgusting believe me nobody will want to willing steal a bite. The coke I ordered was flat and the fries tasted like they were old fries that were refried. They were overly salty and beyond oily. The burger I ordered which you would you think would be the best/ safest food order since it's named after the place was served on buns you could get from a grocery store. Forget the buns, the meat looked also refried and disgusting. I genuinely do not know how this place has any business or is allowed to stay open. Please do not worry about people sharing food when your silverware is dirty and your food literally tastes like garbage. What a joke of a place"

He made it about the $0.12 that I ""couldn't afford"", moreso than me being concerned about his business practices and every table that he ""Rounds up"" on/profits from the additional sales tax.It is a shame, as the food here is good (especially the brunch special).

When called out on this racist policy, the host (owner?) said it was a ""gentlemanly"" rule, not racist. When we left, he said not a word. Not even bye and thank you. My husband addressed him on our way out and he tried to wave him away and wouldn't engage. Mind you, it's a beach cafe, playing sports on the television, with checkered table clothes on the tables.

The workers right off the bat had a bad attitude and were condescending. One of the workers rolled her eyes at my mother when she asked for a particular pastry (which was right there). We ask for TWO separate boxes politely for the orders. Once the worker gave us the box we told her we asked for two separate orders for two individual boxes. The worker rolled her eyes and started talking to her other co-worker like we weren't there... The workers are very unprofessional and horribly mannered, they we're two young girls. We were polite and just asked for a few things (nothing complicated), but they went out of their way to belittle us.Horrible customer service.The pastries don't even taste that good. It's not worth it. Take your business somewhere else."
2149,6jhuT09-nxF_tPZonXnYHA,9/1/2021,2 star rating,I have been coming here for a few years now for their cakes. They used to be so delicious and affordable but I feel they went down hill after Covid. Their prices increased and their cakes are not as good as they used to be. I went in yesterday to get a cake for my husband's birthday. I got the Chocolate buttercream with vanilla cake. The cake seemed old and stale. The buttercream on the inside and outside was very sweet and thick. It just didn't taste right. I think I will stop coming here for cakes.

Placed an order and asked if the specific design I wanted could be done. I was assured that it could. When I picked up my order, I was in disbelief that I was charged so much money for something That looked so horrible. I'm not the one to complain- in fact, I never complain, but I was horrified by the lack of professionalism, service, and product done for me. Honestly, I could've done a better job.When I confronted the 'manager' he stated that I didn't know what I was talking about. He preceded to raise his voice at me when I asked for it to be fixed, I of course yelled back. He confessed that the floral design I wanted is purchased from a vendor and is not made by them! Then why was a charged over $200 for something  they can't even make?? Then notice the lettering- it's so amateur- horrible!  All of the sudden he came around the counter and proceeded to CHOKE ME!!! I wish I was making this up, because I was in such disbelief. I hope they read this review as they know exactly who he choked. I ended up having to contact the cops. Avoid this place!!!!!!!!"

While looking at the selection of pastries, I noticed the two girls smirking and cackling about us. When I placed an order, one of the girls had such a nasty attitude and had a facial expression as if she was annoyed that she was doing her job while taking our order. The pastries were average, but the disrespect was uncalled for. There's another bakery/pastry shop a block away, I recommend going there. We were originally going to go there, but they were closed."

It's located on a pretty action packed strip in a story out with a number of other restaurants nearby. The best part about this restaurant is the hospitality of staff and the indoor/outdoor concept. Plenty of seating both in front of the restaurant, indoors, around the bar, and in the back door patio area.The food itself is generally good but very small portions and missing a bit of kick to the taste. We started off with a bowl of the spicy green beans which was delicious but clearly did not have enough to satisfy the two of us, so we ordered a plate of the potato croquettes. It came with three pieces. For entrées, I ordered the vegan Reuben sandwich which was a nice twist on the traditional Reuben sandwich. But the dish didn't come with any sides and cost $17+. Which, for Astoria, felt a bit pricey. The best part of this establishment is the actual bar: lively, not overbearing and filled with great cocktails. I would not recommend the food as much as the website suggests."

I typically get the Chipotle aioli on the side so I can enjoy it with my tater tots, but that's a personal preference.

We can blame it on life and of course the pandemic.I was allowed to be seated while I waited, 12/23 & the chill was out, so I started with Hot Mulled Apple Cider. Asked if I wanted Rum or Whisky... I went with Whisky. The warmth worked wonders and I decided to keep them coming. We where here to mostly catch up so we didn't focus too much on the food. However, the fried pickles were a great start and the cauliflower & leek soup was surprisingly tasted and also provided the winter warm-up needed from the draft of the opening door. Lastly the fried chicken sandwich was the perfect finish to help absorb the whisky consumed. Looking forward to returning.Just A Note:HH is available... it's best to Ask a a member of the wait staff to explain what drinks have specials applied."

The interior of the restaurant has a fun southern flair, making it unique from many other brunch spots. I ordered the stone fruit and burrata salad. The flavors were absolutely perfect; the sweetness of the peach, the savoriness of the cheese, and the freshness of the greens combined perfectly with the acidity of the dressing. Even if you are not typically a salad person, I highly recommend giving this dish a try. I will definitely be coming back for another brunch here in the future!"

As I walked past the indoor space out into the sprawling, covered, outdoor heated patio I immediately imagined large group hangouts taking place there. The drink list is a step above your run of the mill cocktail bar, with ingredients like kaffir lime mist, italicus bergamot liqueur, and garam masala chai accentuating already delicious drinks. I can never turn down a mezcal drink, and the Cap'n Planet, with mezcal, chai, lime, and cachaca made for a potent drink that reminded me of fall. From their late night food menu I tried a burrata toast with a side of fries, and was impressed that such simple menu items could have me reaching for bite after bite until I finished every last morsel. I only skimmed the surface from my last visit to the Bonnie, but it left me with enough of an impression that I'd leave my usual Brooklyn/Manhattan stomping grounds to hang out there."

Ask any New Yorker and they've got a list of the best (and only) places to buy a bagel in their neighborhoods.I used to live a few doors down from Terrace Bagels, so location definitely plays a huge role in my decision. But the number one reason why Terrace Bagels is the number one place in my heart to buy a good ol' boiled and baked bagel?You can spy the humble Terrace Bagels storefront in the background of Alanis Morissette's music video for her 1995 hit ""Hand in My Pocket."" (She's cruising down Prospect Park West in a parade procession and you can see Terrace Bagels at least twice. Even Alanis knew back then that this place is a Windsor Terrace institution.)Your bagel (or in my case, the delicious Red Bank breakfast wrap with egg, grilled chicken, grilled veggies, and Swiss cheese that I eat at all hours of the day) has 90s music cred."

Day 2 I spiced things up a bit and got a whole wheat everything bagel with light sundried tomato cream cheese and bacon. It was delicious and so much flavor. They did not skimp on the bacon either!

Personally, I wouldn't buy one bite of cake for $3, but the Flour Shop is in SOHO, so I understand why its pricey. Everything here looked very nice too, so if you're looking for some place with very Instagrammable food, this is definitely the spot!

I visited this place because my sister wanted the rainbow cake that they sell. It sounded delicious and she would have loved it, but I wasn't able to transport it back home to Buffalo from NYC. This place seems to be one of those ""Instagram worthy"" places for cute photos. I'm not sure that the truffles actually taste that good but I'm glad I went.

There's nothing special about the taste..same basic flavor no matter what style you order, explosion or otherwise. Their cakes are heavy on sweet cream cheese which really is the only flavor. If I were to summarize the last cake we ordered (thankfully a small one for an Instagram shoot for our pup's birthday) - on the outside it's cute & insta-worthy but on the inside it's a Plain Jane cake. You're better off with places like Dominique Ansel Bakery or evening Fay Da bakery in Chinatown than this place."

Before you complain about a lot of empty space in the middle of the cake, make sure you are aware of that and just go with the original rainbow if that's a problem for you.I am interested in coming back for the all gold covered ""Karrot"" cake, as well as seeing what other flavors Amirah Kassem comes up with."

Just a tip: they don't toast their bagels, as they are confident that it is good to have as is.  I highly recommend JK Bakery, it's been a neighborhood staple for years & they really know what they are doing! :)"

It looks like she had some spine problems. Anyway, don't let that stop you from getting bagels here.

2191,D2fCCyWufWiBTvrt3nMxHg,8/20/2017,5 star rating,Wow. Never have I ever had a bagel like the ones from JK Bakery. JK is a Korean bakery specializing in chewy AND crispy bagels. You know how donuts can be super dense and hard? And only get crispy if you toast them? JK's donuts have a nice and chewy interior with a nice crisp and crunch on the outside to contrast the chewiness! BUT make sure to get them before 10-11am while they're hot or they won't be the same (so I've heard from my aunts/uncles who live nearby). They don't toast the bagels here so you're only option really is to eat them when they're fresh and hot to get the full experience. I tried the cinnamon raisin bagel with cream cheese and it was delicious! Highly recommend this bagel spot. We have nothing like it near me in Southern CA.

I tried their CC and Jelly on an everything bagel and butter on an everything bagel, and both were superb. The bagel was chewy but soft, and you can tell it was handmade because it had imperfections. Every bagel was shaped slightly different and it had bumps. It's a small shop on Union (Next to H-Mart) and it gets crowded quickly. I didn't try the other bagels, but the everything bagel was perfectly seasoned. It had a stronger onion smell than I had expected but it wasn't overpowering. They're also very quick with making your order. They also have a variety of spreads you can choose from as well as drinks."

My friends and I all ordered from the prix fixe lunch menu, which includes a choice of an appetizer, entree, and rice for $22. We split appetizers (Shirazi salad, hummus, and yogurt & cucumber) between the three of us and chose our own entrees. My favorite appetizer was the yogurt - very simple but also indulgently creamy. I chose the vegetarian stew as my entree and it was so so good!! It had a tomato base and tasted like a tangier version of lentil soup. The eggplant also added a delicious smoky flavor. I got the rice with dill & fava beans, and it was some of the most delicious, aromatic rice I've ever had (also paired really well with the yogurt). Other menu items that I'd be excited to try are the basa fish and baked eggplant. Loved how unique all the flavors were - Persepolis has made me want to try more Persian food!"

The service was friendly allowing us to stay there for a long time and giving the person who was ordering for the table good recommendations. I personally got the ""Baby Joon"" which is Arak which is served with Voss Water on ice which came out as expected with a good sized pour of said anise flavored liquor along with said water on the side. On a similar note, they for some give free Voss Water as their tap water (or they fill old Voss bottles with tap water) which is a bit different.Their house made bread came out soon after ordering. It was tasty though my preference in Persian spots is sangak (just more used to it.) In terms of appetizers, we went with some eggplant dishes as well as the yogurt. Specifically they were:Baba (Baked eggplant purée, Persian goat cheese, walnuts and onion)This was a bit of a confusing dish with an odd presentation. While listed as as baba (as in baba ghanoush,) the ingredients were more similar to the Persian dish kashk-e-bademjan. What made sense then was that it was a bit of a mix of both though not exactly as good as either. I'm unsure if it worked exactly but it was interesting. I also found the plating odd as I couldn't help but think of cat food unfortunately though the pickles were nice.Mirza (Roasted eggplant purée, mint, tomato, garlic, and tangy yogurt) This was better. The tomato went well with the pureed eggplant and there was enough yogurt for tang and texture. I would recommend this one much more over the baba. Similar odd presentation.Yogurt trio . The trio came with three different yogurts. The cucumber which is the normal one you find in Persian spots was good while the shallots were great and the beet one was fantastic and overall this was a much better appetizer. Good quality yogurt. The entrees arrived next and there was soon a whole lot on the table (including the massive portions of rice.)The large mixed kebab was quite sharable. The meat on top was the saffron chicken which was very moist. The barg kabob (grilled filet mignon) was perfectly fine; not amazing like some other places but still tender. The koobideh was very good and quite tender. The meat was served with the usual accompaniments such as grilled tomato (didn't have as I don't like them) and torshi or pickled vegetables (cabbage as per usual) along with grilled onion and overall it was fine.The two types of rice she went with were the albaloo polo (my recommendation instead of the zekresh) and baghali polo. The former is sour cherry based and it was definitely one of the best I have had in the city so far in terms of flavor for the rice though it could have used more sour cherries mixed in. The baghali polo / rice with dill and fava beans was surprisingly good and equal to the best version I have had. The saffron rice on top of both was also fine and overall the rice was quite good. In terms of stews, we went with Ghormeh Sabzi and Fessenjan. The former (beef, leafy vegetables, green herbs, red beans and dried lime) was an alright version; definitely well stewed and the small amount of meat that was in there was tender. The latter (shredded chicken, pomegranate and walnuts) is my favorite Persian dish and I have no complaints about this version (outside of a personal preference being a more sour focused one but this was still fine and well stewed.)For dessert, I shared one with another person. We decided to get their combo which came with a piece of Persian style ice cream/bastani (rosewater, saffron, pistachio) which was on top of faloodeh (vermicelli noodles in an granita made from rosewater, sugar, and lime.) The ice cream was fine while the faloodeh was just alright. If you were to get dessert I would just go with the ice cream but I think it would just be better to go somewhere nearby.While the Persian food here was good, there were a few slip-ups. The rice (along with yogurt appetizer) of all things were excellent with those being the closest to the excellent places in New Jersey. I find it hard not to make comparisons to Ridgewood (no not Queens) which are just that much better when it comes to kabobs. If I was to go back, I would get the koobideh with albaloo polo and be quite happy with it. This place is a mid 3 for me though I will bump it up for the nice service and for the few very good options in the midst of everything. In terms of NYC places, it's definitely a good amount better than the Persian spot a good 10-15 blocks up from here."

I'd expect some more flavor.So instead, it's bland, and although it feels lighter than your typical fare the dishes we got tonight both need a sauce. The lemon chicken tasted like butter and was vacant of all lemon.The Caspia meats were equally as dry and the same flavorless meats slapped on a plate with a faint breeze of what maybe resembles something that might one day hit the taste buds... Just unfortunate they they charge such astronomical fees for a prayer that the food will get better after another bite (it doesn't)Maybe that's harsh but I separated with a lot of money and would have been happier with the halal cart outside."
2207,8lHTKVJyiK9V8WiJq9-khQ,10/28/2021,4 star rating,"Tip 1: Lunch Prix Fixe $22 (one appetizer + entree)Tip 2: All entrees seem to come with rice, where you have 4 options (basic, sour cherries (slightly sweet), barberries (pops of tartness), dill/fava bean (herbal/savory)).Some friends shared all of our dishes, so we got to try a plethora of options. Complimentary bread seemed like focaccia bread, which was hot and nicely textured - crispy outside, fluffy insideAppetizers: nothing really stood out to me- Borani: this is literally just yogurt, which was nice on the entrees and such, but didn't realize that was the case- Dolmeh: rice-stuffed grape leaves, the covering is fairly sour- Lentil soup: very hearty and thickEntrees:- Saffron chicken: they ran out of dark meat, so we opted for white meat. It's drier pieces of meat and there was some flavoring, but not enough for my liking.- Gaimeh: the beef stew that sounded interesting given there was cinnamon and such. Even though it smelled amazing, the taste was very standard and unsurprising - not bad, just not very tasty either.- Basa Fish: GET THIS. This was the best entree by far, buttery and flavorful fish.- Vegetable Ghor-Sabzi: a vegetarian stew, this was also just fine to meAll in all, all the rice and the fish were clearly the highlights. I preferred the cherry and dill rice, but my friend loved the tartness of the barberry rice. This place makes me want to come again and try other things, but might opt for off the prix fixe next time."
2208,8lHTKVJyiK9V8WiJq9-khQ,10/12/2021,3 star rating,Was not that thrilled with the food. Has the pre fixe menu which looked really good but was only ok. The Branzini fish was so-so but probably the best dish we had. A little dry but tasty. The hummus and the stuffed grape leaves were good.The beef stew is memorable for the wrong reason - we could not finish it because unfortunately we did not find it that good. It had a strange taste - maybe it was our taste buds but it had a sour taste (not like gone bad) but it didn't have that savoury taste we were looking for. The service is good - the staff is very friendly.
2209,8lHTKVJyiK9V8WiJq9-khQ,2/27/2022,4 star rating,"My friend picked this place as he's really into Persian food and this place is wheelchair friendly. Two in our group are in wheelchairs and it's surprisingly hard to find places that don't have any steps and are truly accessible. We started off with the baba and Sambusa for the appetizers. I was not impressed with the appetizers. The sambusa was a bit dry and the baba didn't really taste like much of anything which I was surprised since I normally love eggplant. My opinion of this place changed completely when I tried the lemon chicken, the lemon butter sauce was beyond delicious! I ordered it with the plain basmati rice and I don't really eat rice very often but because of the sauce I just had to keep eating it. The service was friendly and attentive and we even got some delicious complimentary dessert. I can't wait to go back again for the lemon chicken."

2211,8lHTKVJyiK9V8WiJq9-khQ,7/24/2022,2 star rating,"I honestly can't understand how this place is considered a Persian restaurant. The food is tasteless, stale, and colorless. Speaking only toward what my table ordered:Yogurt trio: no part of any of these yogurts was made in a traditional Persian fashion. The boorani didn't even have spinach in it. The mast o mooseer was straight labne ... and all of them were topped with shredded carrots ?? What?Eggplant Mirza: bitter, overwhelming. Not how it should taste. Saffron chicken: I can guarantee you there wasn't a single ounce of saffron on this dish. The chicken was barely marinated, it was tough, and it lacked the charcoal finish and flavor that is unique to Persian cuisine entirely. Baghali rice - disappointing. Bitter. No aroma. Also... since when is Persian food served with pickled red cabbage and a weird green sauce? Not Iranian at all... and no tahdig on the menu? Ambiance - no Persian tunes. Honestly none of the workers were even Persian. It really lacked the Iranian hospitality. Still on the search for good Persian food in NY. Persepolis was a strong no from me."

2217,Ey45ZiAN1TSVmvfM6DVZqA,4/25/2017,3 star rating,"I recently went to REBAR after the negative press. Overall, it was a positive experience. The layout was a great improvement from G Lounge, and the staff did an effective job. The biggest setback was that the bar was cash only, and I wasn't informed until the drinks were poured. The bartender did make eyes with my visible wallet and card in hand (before making my drinks). So, It did feel as though there was an agenda for me to use the in house ATM with a $3 charge. However, there were no glaring red flags. The experience was nothing to call home about, but nothing occurred to write a poor review.Regarding the press, it/ I did feel tense when I was there. Being fair, I'm a person of color, and  was aware of the press before attending. I'm unsure if it was me or just the aftermath of negative publicity. A part of me understands what may have happened opening night (based on my experience). People of color were represented, but definitely in the minority. From the marketing to the bartenders to the painting on the walls, they're definitely targeting a type. Additionally, the black staffers are so out of type that they do look like ""the help"". It doesn't feel incredibly inclusive, but it is a specific scene. (I totally get that.) Unfortunately, it opens the door for the customer to decide what category the vision and intentions fall under, and many minds went in a racially exclusive direction. (I also understand their perspective.) All things being said (from my end), in our current outrage culture, businesses are being given less and less wiggle room to make mistakes of omission or commission. REBAR isn't my particular scene, but I encourage you to experience it for yourself. It deserves redemption. Don't we all?If I go back again, I'll definitely change my rating to reflect the new experience. A lot of money went into this bar, and I wish it well."

(I'm puzzled by stand-and-chat bars that keep the music too loud to chat. They got it right here.) It is a little tinny, and hopefully they'll address that. A buddy said they need soft material under the tables to absorb it. They could use something.Much better use of the space than the old G. The bartenders were hot, too, and mostly very friendly.

The second time I ordered through Uber eats and let me tell you that food did not come for so long I tried calling NO ANSWER I called literally over 10 times and no answer I honestly thought my food was not coming the app was not updating and truly I was upset. This makes me not want to order from here again despite the food being decent. I hope they get it together because I'm on the fence.

The establish is fairly new so it was very clean inside. They do allow you to sit and eat. We ordered the honey garlic wings (7) and my friend ordered the burger combo which comes with waffle fries. With the 7 wing order you only get one flavor but the lady was nice enough to let me try their DEBO sauce on one of the wings. I didn't care for it. The honey garlic though was good. The wings weren't soggy. My friend said her burger was ok. The bun was very bready, she ended up eating the burger without the bun. They serve ready made beverages, however do not ice! Which put a HUGE damper on my experience. I ordered the cranberry pineapple juice which was good but sweet and would have been better with ice! Burger, Taco's and wings please get an ice machine!"

The chicken sandwiches were close to being inedible. The chicken was tough and had no flavor, but the breading on it had some. The sliders were ok. Again not much flavor; also i asked for no tomatoes but still came with them. The receipt even shows in all caps ""NO TOMATOES"". God forbid we had an allergic reaction. So that was a red flag, no food quality check and no regard towards customers preferences/allergies. Would recommend the removal of lettuce. Some reason both sandwiches came with cooked lettuce?? It was soggy and looked burnt. Not sure what happened there. Website list 'crunchy' lettuce, definitely wasn't. Ended up making the hun and parts of the chicken taste sour too. Maybe the chicken needs to rest before platting it. Good portion sizes though!And side note the delivery driver kept referring to me by the wrong name. Even though it was listed for her on the online order. Sooo yea. Not really a fan and highly unlikely to recommend and return. Sorry."

Now it was a bit hard to find because it's actually a PUB type place with a sign stung up saying BTW . It's not kid friendly at all because of the whole bar . Take out is really the only option unless you are having a drink also. Now hands down some of the best wings I've eaten in a while they have just the right amount of  breading . Also the chicken tacos were delicious my 8yo said . She said mommy the meat is so flavorful. The sweet potato fries and waffle fries were yummy as well.

Steak was hard and dry. Couldn't eat it and gave it to my dog instead. I also ordered two hazelnut iced coffees and the coffee I received did not taste like hazelnut at all. Im surprised at this time around. The bagels and sandwiches are always good. I would skip out ordering anything breakfast platter related going forward.

They charge me for my extra ingredients and when I get home the sandwich doesn't have it. Today's order was chicken salad on a bagel toasted and let me tell you the chicken salad is DISGUSTING, it was very sweet and when I called the manager told me that they put sugar in it. I've never had a sweet chicken salad...... The staff here is more disgusting than the food I would not recommend this place at all, a waste of space in Howard beach"

I thought maybe a snack would satisfy my stomach. So I decided to order delivery here on Grubhub.I decided to get the garlic popcorn chicken and a medium Vivi milk tea with pudding. Delivery came super quick than estimated! ETA was between 25-35mins but it came within 10-15mins. Plus this location is pretty close to here I work lol. When I picked up my order, the popcorn chicken was still piping hot as my drink was perfectly made!Definitely would order from here again when I ceave Vivi's during work! lol"

When we arrived, we were taken aback by how clean and tidy the place looked. After approaching the register, the cashier notified us of a promotion they were having where people could get a free drink upgrade if they check-into the place in social media (Yelp included).I ordered my bubble tea, and probably received it about 10 minutes afterwards (which really surprised me given the very low number of people in the place when I ordered).The bubble tea tasted really good! The machine they used to shake it did an amazing job of helping evenly distribute the coldness in the drink.Later in the afternoon, we returned! This time, we wanted to try out their food menu. I ordered the pork dumplings. The texture of the pork dumplings was very 'gummy'. Also to note, the soy sauce did not stick well to the dumpling. The dumping innards tasted alright.I would go back, but really only to have bubble tea."

I got to the try the almond milk tea regular sweet. Also, got to try their spicy popcorn chicken, it has a good kick more so than your average spicy popcorn chicken. It's like at the flaming hot cheetos level. It was kind of nice to try because we were seeing it everywhere as we walked around like tourist. Would I go back to again, I would say not by choice only because there is a lot of other things I would like to eat but still an okay place to grab a snack."

Popcorn chicken, Taiwanese sausage, pokebowls, sushi rolls, ramen, french fries. Just mind boggling. Hilarious but very convenient if you want some food with your drink. Ordered the peach pulp jade and peach oolong, two of our favorite drinks. Made fast and prompt. Love the customization of ice and sugar. $3.75 for this size is great when compared to other bubble tea joints. Also got my favorite item on the menu, popcorn chicken. So good. Freshly made, tender chicken, great flavor. Can't go wrong with this as a snack. I liked that they had a few tables there so we could enjoy our quick snack while our baby napped. Cute and convenient location."

It was pricy too for milk tea. Bubble Milk tea $3.25. Then they charge .25cent. Then tax.Which equal to $3.81!

Unless it's super amazing, i generally give a 3/5 for your run of the mill bubble tea spot (your CoCos and what not).The poke bowl was good, the fruit was fresh and ripe.  The fish itself was good but like my bubble tea rating scale, if it's not amazing, it's not getting more than a 3.  The other components of the Hawaiian poke bowl consisted of Kani salad, seaweed salad, etc.  It was good and i'd go back.  I've had better and worse at other spots so if there were a 3.5, thats what id give it."

I was a sucker and ordered sushi and most soup.The sushi was actually pretty good, but they serve it in a tiny little take out container, so there's no room for me to put the ginger and wasabi on the way I do. They do add those delicious little black seeds to the rolls that I love... that was good. But man, STAY AWAY FROM THE MISO SOUP! Tasted like hot water with mushroom... I could see the miso in there, but could hardly taste it. Also, it's served in a plastic take-out soup container. No big deal unless you know about the way plastic leaches into food when that food is hot (like miso soup)."
2262,31PVkhg390bKOnkGxD8kRw,9/1/2018,2 star rating,"Went for my first time today early in the morning when they opened at 9:30 AM. We had just finished our last final of the semester and unfortunately were meet by some poor customer service. 1. We walked in and it was a minute or two before 9:30. We saw an employee at the counter and the door was unlocked. We walked up to the counter and he let us know that they were not open yet, so we went back outside. It was completely our mistake for walking in too early, but it would have been nice for the employee to say something like ""5 more minutes"" or ""feel free to have a seat, I'll be with you shortly"". Instead we just stood outside and stared at him, waiting for a signal to let us know that he was ready. He did not wave to us so we just walked back inside after a minute and started to order. It was pretty bizarre.2. They have a decent food menu for a boba shop. We went to order some popcorn chicken and he said, ""We don't have any chicken."" He didn't explain why, and there were no signs stating food was not served in the morning, so that was a bit confusing and a bummer since we were hungry.3. There was a sign that said 30% off for students. My friend went before me and showed him her school ID for a discount and cashier entered it for her. Then, the cashier was switched out for another employee and I also let her know I was a student. She attempted to put in the discount code. There is a small screen that would show the total and I could see her multiple attempts to put in a discount. The total was over 50% off of my drink price and I told her I think that was a mistake, so she attempted to fix it again to take the correct amount off. After talking to the other employee and failing to get 30% off of my total, she then said ""I'm sorry, we don't have a student discount"". Mind you my friend just got her discount and there is a sign explaining that they do. Or the other employee could have easily typed it in for her.BUT on the plus side, you can customize the sweetness level of your drink which is always a plus and the boba was fresh and well-cooked. The drinks were well-prepared and service was quick. They also have a few tables and outlets if you would like to study here. There are so many delicious boba places in the city, so customer service really comes into play when I'm deciding where I want to go, and unfortunately this day left a bad taste in my mouth."

Headed over to Kosher Deluxe with high hopes...hopes that were quickly and utterly destroyed when I took my first bite. The soup tasted canned and had one of the sorriest matzoh balls I've ever seen; tiny, fractured, and dense. They also gave me a small bag of stale bread to throw in. Nice accompaniment! My girl's pastrami sandwich came on ""rye bread"" that had terribly soft crust and stuck to the roof of your mouth like Wonder Bread. The meat tasted pre-packaged and not fresh sliced like most delis. Overall...heinous.I kicked myself for not walking out the door immediately after seeing chicken nuggets, lo mein, and sushi on the menu board. This combo of items in any single restaurant is, without a doubt, the clearest possible sign that you are about to experience an utter catastrophe for the taste buds. Oh, and for what it's worth...this place smells and the floor and tables are filthy.I have to wonder, are the people rating this 3 stars or better doing so because it's good Kosher food or simply good food? As a stand alone meal, it was without a doubt one of the worst I've ever had in any restaurant, Jewish or otherwise.Avoid like the Ten Plagues."

Decided to get the chicken sesame chicken even though it had a (highway robbery) price of $25!!!! Twenty-five dollars!! I specifically ordered it in a to-go box cuz I knew I wasn't going to be able to eat it all in one sitting, & I wanted to save myself a trip back to the counter. The food comes out, and I stay at the table and watch the belongings of the group. My friend brings me my food, and my tray contains my order on a styrofoam plate, along with an empty to-go container. Okay, totally valid, I completely understand forgetting to pack it up!! THEN my friend let me know that the container was old and reused. The server half assed rinsed it out and then handed it to over to give to me. The container looks oily and gross and USED! And I just paid $25!!! 25 dollars!!!So I politely go up to the counter and I say: ""hi, can I please have a new container? This one is reused, and is dirty"". And the man starts YELLING AT ME ""THIS IS A PERFECTLY GOOD CONTAINER!!!"". So I calmly reply ""can I please have a new container? I see you have a stack of fresh containers."" He replies (yelling): ""WHATS YOUR PROBLEM??? It's perfectly fine! You want me to just waste money and give you a different container, when this one is perfectly fine? What am I going to do with this container now?? What do you expect me to do??"". I said: ""I don't know what you are going to do with that container, but I am a paying customer here and I would like a new container"" ($25.00!!!!). He then practically throws the container at me across the counter!! The AUDACITY!I wanted to take my expensive food home, and I wasn't going to place it in that receptacle. Thinking back, I can't exactly vouch for the cleanliness of the food once my food was given to me along with a dirty container. Would not recommend!"

I usually ordered a burger, and occasionally, I would bite into an unidentifiable piece of something hard or gristly, but I usually let that slide, because it's quick and easy. Also, because I never had to deal with them messing up my order before.Unfortunately, that was not the case last Friday. I ordered a burger as I have previously, with no pickles or ketchup, and I checked the printout when I picked it up to make sure, as I always do. However, when I arrived back at work, lo and behold both ketchup and pickles were present, and my lunch ruined. My lunch break is not flexible, so I had no time to return to the store. I figured oh well, it happens. I'll just call them and see what they are willing to do.What a disaster. I could not believe how rude the lady I spoke to on the phone was after I told her what happened. She first told me I would have to go back and return the burger before they would do anything, because they didn't believe me. When I told her this was not possible, because I did not have enough time on my lunch break, she put me on hold while she went to get a manager. She never put the manager on the phone, though, instead she simply told there was nothing they could do, even when I asked for a credit instead of a refund. I then offered to send them pictures, because I am adamant when people think I am lying. She gave me an email to send the photos to, and she said they would credit my card after verifying them. Then, she gave a brief, insincere apology (the first I'd gotten out of the entire call), and hung up.I sent the email and have gotten no response and no credit. I've decided to upload the pictures here in an effort to warn others to stay away from this establishment."

You are allowed to pick your plate or container, pick your choice of grub as you please, and then take to the register for weighing and paying.Note: You are allowed two pieces of salmon while getting other food as well for the standard $6.99 per lb. Not adhering to the two salmon policy and taking possession of 3 or more pieces of salmon will result in a per pound fee of $9.99. Consider yourself warned.Trying to eat healthy, I got a couple pieces of salmon, a piece of sweet potato, steamed vegetable medley, piece of chicken breast and a tablespoonful of brown rice. Yeah I know, a lot of protein. I'd just lifted weights, legs that is, earlier in the day so the protein went to a great cause.All the food was flavorful, both salmon and chicken were tender and juicy.

My husband called and they said they couldn't reach the driver that we would have to wait until he returned so they can read the order sheet and they will call back. 30 mins later and no call the driver comes back with the black coffee and a bag of fruit. My husband called the store to complain about them sending a bag of fruit instead of replacing the whole order and expecting me to just add the fruit to my now cold waffle and they basically said it isn't their fault that I didn't eat my waffle when it was delivered. Bad customer service. Bad business practice and no respect for their customer.

Although the servers were a bit slow coming to the table the service was good. They were even able to let me order something off of the dinner menu - falafel and last minute switch in milk preference to my latte. For meal we had the eggs benezatar which was good - the middle eastern twist was that it was served on pita with zatar and tomato salad.  Food was very fresh and tasted great but not mind blowing. Will have to come back for dinner. Loved the traditional twist on a modern coffee shop. Lattes , americanos were well crafted. Pastries looked delicious walking out. Too bad I was so full. Portions were large."

He ordered the souffle and I ordered the Yemeni kabobs and a coke which came all under 35 dollars. The kabobs were a tiny bit dry but were well balanced by the accompanying sauce. The salad was fresh and the vinegrette atop was lovely. The rice was topped with parsley for a bit of freshness. The souffle looked inviting and came with two fresh breads which were quite delicious. Overall the food was good, at a good price, and the service was wonderful. So why only 4 stars? I just have to work my way through the menu! Don't worry... I'll be back!"
2295,uQPVQuZB-jUSmYK2Gn-Q8A,12/19/2021,4 star rating,"But of a unique concept, part cafe part restaurant. Service was a tad slow but our waiters were nice! Ended up ordering the chicken shawarma sandwich with a side of halloumi. Plus a chai adeni to boot. The chai itself: fragrant and not too sweet. The shawarma itself was tender and flavorful with big chunks of chicken. The tzatziki was herb packed and piled high with crunchy vegetables and the halloumi was salty and squeaky! Really, overall, a satisfying lunch.On my way out, got a glance of the pastries: some traditional, some not (hello pistachio croissants). Plus a slew of seasonal and unseasonal caffeinated beverages. If I lived in the area or stopped by again, would definitely be down to try its other offerings!"

Because I had already looked at the menu before arriving, I knew what I wanted..... the shawarma and za'atar fries. I wasn't ready for how delicious this was! Let's be honest, some food has changed since Covid. Whether it's the taste, the amount or the price, something is different. However, when I came here, it was like a time change to precovid days! The shawarma was bursting with flavor, the chicken was juicy and the fires where crispy perfection! This is a place that I will go to when I'm in the area for sure. I'm excited to explore the menu and taste it all!"

To begin, they had  plenty of outdoor off sidewalk seating and the heat lamps were on!  They also had a kids menu and high chairs which now is an important lookout for us. It's also BYOB and has some virgin cocktails on the menu that are quickly made alcoholic if you bring your own alcohol. I split the sampler of dips (Hummus, Babaganoush, and Muhammara with pita) for $12 and got falafel mezze for $7. The Muhammara dip is a tangy eggplant dip and was absolutely delicious with a great hint of spice.  All in all - pretty flavorful and good quality for the price. They also do bowls, salads, and sandwiches ranging from $10-20 so there are a ton of options.  We tried the chicken nuggets off the kids menu for our child and she was not a big fan, preferring to eat pita and the zatar spiced fries."

The wait for food did end up taking a while given the number of people eating there and the service was a bit u organized. An upside however was that the food was great (especially after being hungry) and had great flavors. Shakshuka was a bit small and definitely not enough to share which I didn't expect.

Outdoor seating area is protected from the elements but still lets you enjoy the daylight when the weather is decent. Staff is mostly friendly. Dessert list is extensive. The one downside is they often drop the ball with execution of the order. I've been here 8 times or so by now and on over half the occasions the food takes a super long time to come even though it's not crowded, or they forget one of the orders for the table, or you have to check on the order to make sure it gets done. Last time I was there my food came a full 20 min after my friend's even though we ordered at the same time. I had to go to the counter twice to ask what was going on. It was cold out so I didn't want her food to get cold so she started without me. If they could sort out these order completion issues I would give them 4 stars."
2301,uQPVQuZB-jUSmYK2Gn-Q8A,7/25/2022,5 star rating,A near perfect falafel. Bonus is the true hot sauce on the side. Fries were good too. Nice outdoor seating available. Even on 100 degrees we managed to get a good breeze on the street.

I will never know.I was picturing one of the ones they have posted on here. Warm, loaded enough and cheesy. But no... got this instead...Made me thing of McD's ACTUAL burgers vs. Their advertisement. Or if you have gone on a dating app... if you know, you know....Pictures don't always match the description of the person...Soooo sure Those 3 1/2 peperoni slices were a special treat. I cut and separated them so it looked more abbondante.Hmmm...nO I didn't but not a bad idea...maybe next time...This was a ""just ok"" for a non vegan margarita pizza BUT DEFINITELY an excellent choice if you have a high cholesterol....Meat lovers flatbread Light 2.0...you should be mindful of the cheese also  if you have Cholesterol issues...ANYWAY...I was not expecting a meat lovers that offends every vegan but satisfying and true, at least to its name.

Even though I ended up getting pho which I'm used to eating all of the time. The pho was basically like Vietnamese pho but I think the broth was a bit stronger in flavour with cinnamon or something. The meat was a little crunchier than meat I usually eat in pho. I liked the sauce it came with though, which doesn't typically come with Vietnamese pho. It was all super tasty! I liked the pho and it was filling but I think after I left the place I just realised it was literally just regular pho honestly that had minor changes and was $30-40 basically with tip and taxes... I can get a $10 bowl at a regular pho place and get the same amount of happiness for it... Not worth coming here for the pho to be honest. I think everything here is just expensive and not exactly worth the price point, when you can get the same thing somewhere else for cheaper."

The inside was lively but not too crowded or loud, and the ambiance is amazing: dark lighting with accents, candles, dark wooden tables.We ordered the sticky rice with sauces, chicken larb, crispy coconut ball with sausage, and pork belly wrap. Overall food was flavorful, authentic, but with a unique twist. The sticky rice was great and we really enjoyed the eggplant and spicy sauce. It also paired well with the other dishes so would definitely recommend. The chicken larb was good, but could've used more spice. It felt like it could have had something more to give it an extra wow factor. The crispy coconut rice balls were indeed quite crispy, but could've had more coconut flavor. The sausage was lacking and not very juicy or flavorful, so overall the dish felt a bit dry and could've used a sauce. The pork belly wraps were very yummy, but the fried pork skin was too thick and hard, making the wraps a little too chewy and some pieces difficult to eat. Pork belly couldve also been a little saltier. This place was definitely pricey, so maybe worth it to try the unique food once, but not a go again kind of place."

2306,4byAirxIA4OEgKHHgJfKLw,7/30/2022,5 star rating,I love this place and I'm Lao. I keep asking if the owner and chef is there and he's never there or is supposed to stop by and doesn't. I'm for sure always the only Lao person in there everytime I've gone and I've brought countless of Lao folks there too.My friend Ova and the people at Laos Angeles tipped me off on this place. And it indeed is the only Lao food in all of NYC. The price point is ridiculous for the average Lao person but it's not for them really. It's for the rich folks of tribeca. But they don't sacrifice the rich and dark flavors of the rustic Lao cooking even if they use massaged pigs that live in oak groves or their Nam Khao Todd is coconut glistened. I wish the staff understood more the cultural significance of the food and how to properly describe it but that's maybe asking a lot. They could hire me. I've been a server for a long time. The ribs are bomb. We got jerky that was burnt and I sent it back. The chicken special was too orange chicken like or like the wings at Night + Market and was huge compared to the small servings of everything else. I like the sausage and the green Jeow with the sticky rice was really good. I'd stick with pork items here.
2307,4byAirxIA4OEgKHHgJfKLw,7/3/2022,3 star rating,"Honestly this place was just ok... I'm a big fan of Laotian and Thai food but for what we got, it was pretty overpriced. Every entree was around $30+. The pho noodles were nothing more than a standard pho bowl you can get at any viet restaurant and the chicken and rice dish were not impressive at all. Even the best seller: pork curry noodles were super salty and rich. The dish was definitely flavorful but it was nothing more than flat noodles and ground pork in a curry/coconut milk broth. Service was kind and the ambiance of the place was nice, but for the price we paid I don't think it is worth returning to."

They were not that busy and we didn't need the reservation. Their outdoor area is a cute setup (dogs allowed) but the tables are small.We ordered the pho and the pork curry noodles. The pho was decent but the price to quality is not worth it. It's not the best pho we've had. My pork curry noodle came with no noodles. I had to flag the waitress who took my food back to add noodles. When it came back, it had noodles but they were in huge unappetizing chunks. The soup itself had decent flavor but the chunk noodles were overcooked and weird. Overall not worth the price. Service was friendly but nothing special. Won't be back."

Decently sized portions, delicious food, and lots of veggies so the dishes felt healthy. So when I saw they were on the restaurant week list, of course I had to come again. We came for the $30 lunch which featured one appetizer and one entree. My boyfriend and I ordered the spring rolls and chicken to start. The spring rolls and chicken were both super crispy and warm, well seasoned and delicious. But the portions were small - the spring rolls and chicken only came with 2 pieces each. For the entree, we ordered the Cornish hen and hanger steak pad see ew. Again, everything was delicious but the portions were TINY. The Cornish hen provided a huge portion of rice but the protein itself was mostly bone. The pad see ew came in a tiny bowl. The meal was not enough to fill us up.Overall we really wanted to enjoy our meal but we felt scammed paying $30 pp for such a small amount of food. If you go to Khe-yo, I would order off their regular menu instead."

You can tell the guy to make it crispy or not. The bacon is thick and smokey. Not bad at all. Have you ever eaten egg , bacon and cheese fro Dunkin donuts.? It's 10 times better. Trust me. It is! The owner is friendly and the whole crew is active. You reach there in the morning and already they are on their heels. It's great to see a small business having such spirit and engaging conversation.The sitting area can be full at times but there will be seat always. They close at 4:30 PM and they don't open on Sunday. I still remember one day I came into the store soaked in the morning rain and the owner guy was smiling at me and telling that I could use a coffee. :) I took the coffee and sat near the window looking into the end of flatbush avenue and cars rushing to reach their owners offices.

Basic Chinese takeout menu with a large list of options at slightly higher than normal prices.Kept it simple and ordered the General Tao's Chicken with brown rice ($14). Food came in about 20 minutes - accompanied by various sauces, utensils, and even plates. Chicken itself is okay; a good amount of tang in the sauce yet a little too much breading. Broccoli soaks up the sauce as expected (didn't touch the brown rice).It's about what I expected from what I ordered. Good if hankering for your typical Chinese takeout/delivery."

2344,ye-TSU-mu1Gd5TAJOpI5Mg,2/16/2016,3 star rating,I've tried a few things from here. Don't remember much of the names but it's comparable to the rest of the Latin American bakeries I have been to. The place is small but the line moves fast.I also tried a Papa Rellena which was darker than normal but also excellent. Quite greasy but tasty.

Came in on a cold New Years Day morning, happy as a clam for a good start to the year, excited to try something new to start the year.  Instead, I, along with several other customers, experienced blatant racial discrimination.The line was about 4-5 people deep when I came in to grab a hot cup of coffee and a hopefully delectable pastry. Everything was normal, as the man took care of 2/3 people ahead of me, while offering mediocre service (smiles cost nothing).In walks an older Dominican woman. She takes the liberty of skipping the line, and loudly addresses the man behind the counter...relax lady, it's early and the store is small AND there are people here ahead of you. This is when it becomes a WTF moment.The man immediately takes care of the woman who had CLEARLY just walked in. The main difference between her and everyone else on line? She spoke to him in Spanish.The woman in front of me takes issue with this, and lets her know that she just skipped the entire line. The Domincan woman's response? ""Yeah, I know"" *stupid smirk* (the kind that says 'I'm sorry, but it's too late for you to do anything)So she looks to the guy behind the counter to see what he does, and he just continues fulfilling the skipper's order.The disgruntled woman in front of me walks out, and I followed suit.Before I leave, the Dominican woman gives me a look, as if to say 'That lady is crazy.'I say the only thing I can possibly think of, 'You can't blame her, you did just skip the entire line.' I would've been next, but it was hard to stay and let racial profiling win."

I wandered in here because I saw the name and being Dominican I wanted to see what they had to offer.  The place is pretty small, with a non descript sign on top. They have all the usual pastries you will find in most Dominican bakeries and of course they have Dominican cake.  I'm extremely particular about my Dominican cake so I didn't even try the one here but they do sell it by the slice as well as the usual whole cakes.  What I did have here was the majarete and it was amazing!! For those who don't know majarete is this amazing corn pudding, that  I recall from my childhood as a treat you would get every once in a long while because it was so time consuming to make. I couldn't believe how wonderful this tasted, it's so smooth, sweet and they sprinkle tyne perfect amount of cinnamon on top.  I even got some for my mother and she loved it.  This place is cash only but the prices here are super cheap. If you're in the neighborhood and want to try some authentic Dominican treats you should definitely come here!"

They also brew great coffee. If you like pastries, you will find a huge selection to choose from.

I remember coming here as a kid and grabbing breakfast before heading to Chinese school Now, I make this my daily stop before going to school/work. While I've noticed the prices steadily increasing, its still cheaper and more affordable than other places. There's warm buns, hot dishes such as noodles/tea eggs/rice, and congee. The tables could use some cleaning though but for the most part the space is clean. On a busy morning there's 3-4 workers but that decreases to around 2 during the afternoon. Service is quick and efficient, no frills and you're out the door in less than 5 minutes with breakfast/lunch/maybe dinner, for under $20."

The bread is frail so it has no texture and everything just collapses as you bite into it.But this time I bought a bag of sticky rice roll for breakfast and the sticky rice tastes like CIGARETTES!

This bakery is small and has limited seating and the staff has limited English but is friendly. I was here last winter and had asked for a takeout menu or business card. I was told at the time that they were too new and would have some soon. When I asked again today about 6 months later, they used the same excuse. Pretty lame but okay to stop here if you are passing through and want something more local than DD or BK!"

My sister tried their fried pork dumplings before and told me good things about them so I knew I had to try them.The bakery is situated on a high pedestrian and traffic corner. In addition, it is right off of the Bay Parkway Train Station on the D Line. Small bakery and limited seating. Staff is nice and helpful. They have an assortment of buns, baked goods, dim sum, and quick fixes for lunch/snacks which makes it very convenient to pick up.The dumplings were 5 for $1.75 which were darn cheap! It seems they only have one type of dumpling which is the fried pork dumpling. The dumplings were scrumptious! They weren't crispy or crunchy, but somehow they still tasted great. The dumpling skin wasn't too thick which I liked. The filling inside consisted of ground pork, jicama, and chives. Very tasty and flavored well. The jicama gave the dumpling a slight crunch to it. I really liked the fact this bakery is close to my house and the train station. There's many bakeries along 86th street, but this one really stands out from the ones I've tried because of these delectable dumplings."

But sometimes you'll end up with stomaches. Their service is horrendous. 5 times I've purchased their shrimp rice rolls and spare rib over rice and they forget the most important ingredient: the soy sauce. Once I can understand. But 5 times is just ridiculous. Fed up to the point I actually called them to complain. They came up with so many excuses, got loud and disrespectful then hung up on me. I'll be spending my money elsewhere."

I ended up getting just a few cookies and left. But when I opened to eat them.. They were good and tasted great! I wouldn't say my next experience would be the same.. Not knowing what to expect when I buy them. And that will keep me from coming back.

Like the mini buns.  Perfect size for someone like me who like to eat small portions.  This way allows me to try a little bit of everything.  Nice!
2361,hbtVqkmpaGDbrF6BsFa_rw,6/24/2016,2 star rating,The bake and steam buns are OK but if you want dimsum it's better to walk a block down to the actual dimsum restaurant and pay an extra buck. The pan fry dumplings are filled with pork fat and too oily.The ladies that work here are nice but the guy that works the rice roll station is extremely verbally abusive. Asking him a simple question about the rice rolls will get you yelled at. Even the ladies that work there will warn you not to talk to him.

The aroma of different congee, noodles, buns, dim sum wrapped around me like a warm, fuzzy blanket. Along the wall to your right, you also have a panel of photos of the different dishes with English translation and listed prices. They take care of us Americans good. Walking a few more steps forward, their famous egg cakes ""Dahn Go"" will hit you like a storm as they come freshly baked out of the oven. Oh they are so soft, fluffy and warm when you immediately try them. Let them sit for a few hours and they are still good! To the back they have their usual breakfast buns. Inexpensive Chinese breakfast with a wide selection. Not a bad way to start your mornings!Of course, their food isn't the healthiest..but it's nice to indulge here every now and then."

Had read some reviews and all were favorable, and now I see why. Our waiter Ernie was excellent - attentive, professional and efficient. He adjusted some of our orders, figuring out quickly what we would like most. And he nailed it perfectly. I LOVE THIS PLACE. Really, I don't often have such an overall positive impression of a restaurant, but it was just perfect in every way. The Greek salad was traditional, simple and straightforward, although there could have been a bit more onions and no lettuce. But okay, it was still nice and the pikilia spread was delicious - all four spreads were amazing, spread on perfectly toasted pita. My wife had the grilled shrimp and I had the grilled salmon. Excellent portions, enough to take home for another meal! The baklava was amazing and the white Greek wine I had was awesome. This restaurant is now on our go-to list. I can't wait for our next visit."

The decor is kinda retro mid-century and there's more seating then you'd think.They have some sandwich options and quick prepreped food like a Starbucks but probably better for you. VEGETARIAN options too!From my understanding they turn into a wine bar at night which is smart.-When ordering at fancy places like this I always get a mocha or a cappuccino to kinda test their abilities. I think the mocha I got from Kava was the best I've had in a LONG ASS TIME. Not bitter, not too sweet, not too chocolate-y. Just drank it just as they gave it to me. -My friend got a cappuccino and it was nice as well. Very smooth and light. -The almond croissant was very good. Not fresh out of the oven or anything but the flavor was nice and it was pretty big. -The cherry something scone was weird but I think that might have been on me. Tasted like artific cherry flavoring or something. Didn't finish it. -They also don't have trash cans anywhere. Just in the wall at the sugar and stirrers station in the back so people who were too lazy to throw their things away left hem all over the counters. The servers were also pretty slow on clearing them away too even after seeing we were trying to push old coffee mugs and used spoons out of our way to sit. A bit of an attitude too like they were all fed up with their jobs and were reluctant to do them. My suggestion, take your coffee to go and walk on the Highline. Maybe grab a pastry or their sandwiches."

Barista was super nice and guided us to the bathroom when we needed it. During the day time, this cafe is a full fledged cafe.

The cashier was not friendly in the least and seemed annoyed that I was there to make a purchase. Cool, I'm there for pizza so no biggie. The pizzas all looked dried and were not the most appetizing to look at... but looks can be deceiving, right? We ordered a plain slice, a pepperoni Sicilian, and a ziti slice. As we waited we noticed the cashier completely ruined 2 ""fresh"" pies. I mean they looked horrible but again not my pizza not my problem. We tried to pay with a $50 bill and the cashier said they didn't take cash... but had a register. Okie dokie card it is. Finally left, get home and it looked so off putting but I am very particular so I still give it a go. I tried very hard to like this pizza, but half way through I started feeling sick. Mind you I was starving so this was a major red flag. The Sicilian seemed ok and we just neglected the plain slice as the sauce was basically a dark brown color and was so dry it was not worth it to try.Needless to say I woke up in the middle of the night with a very bad stomach ache and ended up with food poisoning. I am almost 100% sure those pizzas sat out all day, and while I understand not wanting to waste food this was the worse pizza I have ever had in my life and was very negligent on their end. I have never gotten food poisoning  from pizza before. Thanks Vinny's for teaching me a very valuable and depressing lesson."

They have a lunch special of 2 cheese slices plus a soda for $5.99. For a quick slice or late night snack I get a cheese slice plus a random specialty slice (usually something meaty) and that fills me up. For delivery, I get their large pie because I like cold pizza leftovers! I also appreciate that they are not too stingy on cheese, meats, or toppings. For example, they top their Cesar Salad with tons of parmesan and chicken, and on their slices with a good amount of meat and sauce."

A man and a woman introduced themselves as the 'owners' to me, while striping me of all my rights at the bar over a pool table misunderstanding with another customer. In the herd of trying to prove 'who she was', the women (owner) shut down the pool table, refused to lend an ear to hear the slightest information that I had to provide her with, took our drinks away, charged us for it, lost our credit card, and more importantly, called me racist abusive names that pointed toward my ethnicity, as she asked us to get out. The very nature of this interaction proves that the owners are racists and incompetent to handle the bar they are trying to run and work with 'assumptions' about anyone who walks in. She was accompanied by a huge man who was yelling at us like we were some punks and gloating and shouting as loud as he could as we were leaving (and we were two tiny girls!). I believe that my neighborhood is safe and I have never faced racism here. It's people like these that destroy the United spirit of this neighborhood and Brooklyn!Response to the business owner's comment: I'm not sure if it is normal for you to ignore harassed customers or if it was okay to unleash your white bouncer at us (we were two tiny girls!!) and ask us to get out when we said that you were being racist. You sure are a good storyteller and I don't need your luck or as much as breathe the same air in the presence of your white supremacy. I'm sure you don't know what you did wrong. How would you?Get you facts correct. It wasn't a trans joke. Educate yourself. It was a respectful mention of he/she is not giving up the pool table, as it should be. Or did you just think that because we look different we are of course biased towards trans people. Why else would you comment on my ethnicity, miss prejudiced owner? We didn't even have as much as a conversation with your 'black' bartender. Are you mentioning him because he is black and that makes you look non-racist? Lol. I wouldn't engage anymore and be as low as you are. As they say, bye Felicia."

2400,jXcc7Ofp5b5Xwa3-NZc9Sw,3/11/2019,5 star rating,"What a great neighborhood dive bar.  It's quite roomy in this place, even with all the games.  There's a pool table, some pinball machines, there's a bowling game.  They have a tv tuned into Jeapardy every weekday at 7pm and whatever game everyone is interested in the rest of the time. The bartenders are all fantastic.  They have a decent selection of beer and liquor. Surprisingly, the place gets filled up in the later hours after 12AM.  Who likes empty bars? Not I.  If your travels take you to the South Slope, don't pass up the opportunity to check this place out.  You won't regret it."

2402,jXcc7Ofp5b5Xwa3-NZc9Sw,4/1/2018,4 star rating,Been coming to this place for close to 14 years and have seen several generations of bartenders come and go. It's a staple of the neighborhood. Friendly no nonsense bartenders. Crowd is a mix of young pinball kids and local regulars. Sometimes it can get a little crazy but mostly harmless. Also a nice place to go if you want to have a drink in silence and get away from your thoughts. The regulars here are very loyal to the place.

It's located in Korea Town in Manhattan and serves a modernized twist on Korean food. Order: Kim-cheese fries, steamed mussels, crispy squid, and chicken wings. The food was okay. Only complaint - The kim-cheese fries had way too much cheese and not enough kimchi. The cheese also made the fried super soggy and soggy fries are just not pleasant to eat."

The Maze is located on the 3rd floor which you can take the stairs or the elevator. Once you walk in, you'll see that it's decorated with lights and flower garlands suspended from the ceiling which makes it a cute bar to hang out at. For drinks, my friends and I ordered bottles of soju and for food we got the Korean Pancakes, KIMCH-EESE Fries, Chicken Wings, and Korean Spicy Rice Cakes.The food and drinks were good no complaints.  Out of all the foods, my favorite was the Korean Spicy Rice Cakes. I liked how they added the fried appetizers in there like mozzarella sticks which is my favorite thing to eat. The service was great and they were super attentive in getting rid of all the bottles of soju we kept drinking. The music was lit and it was all good vibes till we were told we were ""TOO LOUD"" and had to be quiet. That completely ruined my experience here. My group ended leaving after and went to another bar to buy more drinks. It just completely caught me off guard because it's a bar and people are drinking so it's expected to get loud. I even noticed other groups that were even louder. Overall, I had a good time up till that hence why I couldn't give it a better rating even though the food and drinks were decent. Maze can be a good time but just watch how loud you are."
2410,2ClkHmHOG_m5EuHTt-l_Ig,6/25/2022,5 star rating,"I've heard great things about the Maze from friends so I was excited to finally experience it for myself. The decor is definitely noteworthy. The flower garlands suspended from the ceiling elevate this from your typical pub/bar to a date worthy spot. Their system of checking ids and moving people inside from the elevator is confusing, so make sure you explicitly state that you want a table to prevent them from assuming you want to stand around the bar area.Once seated, things were much smoother. Service was prompt. A few friends in our group had never tried soju so we ambitiously ordered THREE different soju pitchers- mango, lychee, and melon. Each pitcher is $39. We did rounds of each and surprisingly, we loved all of them! All of them had authentic flavors. The sweet, fruity flavors are perfect for people like me who don't care for the taste of alcohol. Of the three, I liked the melon and lychee the best.We also ordered the Maze Kimchi Teppanyaki. It comes on a big sizzling hot plate and a great size for sharing. The top is glazed with a thick layer of melted mozarella that makes it a potent comfort food for anyone craving carbs to pair with the soju.Loved their soju cocktails and ambiance! It's a fun spot for a group of friends on a Friday night."

We noted that at least when we entered; there was no menu with prices in the front of the business. We were greeted quickly and seated very quickly which was appreciated. I asked for the non alcoholic spirit options to which the bartender provided a rather unfriendly ""we don't have any"". How do you ask me without verbally asking me why we sat at a bar if I don't drink?(hint: give me the look and reaction this bartender did) However to the bartenders credit; she rebounded quickly realizing I wasn't kidding and offered a ""soda of the day"". An appreciated gesture. (The soda was good) When we looked at the menu; the prices were surprisingly expensive for how the storefront presents itself. My partner and I are open minded so we stayed. We ordered the prosciutto to start. $18 for 5 pieces of meat and 3 pieces of bread is a rather unreasonable ask. The plate came out as expected minus the quantity provided. We then ordered the second course of a pesto pasta. $28 for pest pasta is also a rip off considering they give you about a cup and a half of a serving. Pasta is inexpensive as is pesto. The final dish was the $44 scallops. We got 5 over cooked/burnt scallops that were still decent tasting. However; they were no $44 good. Noteworthy is it took *forever* for food to come out and the restaurant was not packed out. I would expect for the prices you are paying a much higher level of service. Save yourself time and money and go to saringhinas cafe down the road. Or go to Walters by the park. Better view, better service, and more affordable. *restaurant also deceptively puts tip in food prices then allows for option to tip more for their subpar service buyer beware**"

First off the restaurant is so dark that one cannot adequately read the menu or see the food. There is a single little candle on the table. When my partner turned on her iPhone flashlight to read the menu, the maitre d' came over immediately to tell us that the light was disturbing other diners. She did not care that we were having trouble reading in the dark and offered no solution such as an additional candle. We felt that she was extremely rude and insensitive. Secondly, the restaurant is so small and loud that one cannot even have a conversation easily. Thirdly, the food was completely underwhelming - at least what we could see of it. And very expensive for what you got. In addition, despite ordering dessert there was no mention from the staff of our birthday occasion. When making a reservation, why does RESY even ask about a special occasion if this is completely ignored at this establishment? And after $120 for a meal for two with one appetizer and no drinks we were both extremely disappointed. We will probably never go there again."

I used to be so excited to eat here, but I won't be going back."

The ambiance was wonderful, the service beyond notable, and food and drinks were the kind that warm you on the inside. Comforting to the next level. I got the daily bitter cocktail, not fully understanding any of the ingredients, and leaving it wishing I could recreate it at home because it would be an incredible refreshing go-to. An eggplant pasta and little gem salad were to die for. Ran into some friends who come here for dessert, so while we were full, stayed for an extra course. Fig ice cream and loaf - yum!"

When I mentioned that it was wrong the guy TOOK OUR FORK from our table and scooped out the lemon from the drink (a $30 drink too) and tossed it on the floor and didn't fix it.

2463,inDTYbUj_quqluaR2icoVQ,1/13/2023,4 star rating,"I went here during summer a good 2.5 years so my memories are a bit foggy. I remember being here pretty late and the service being very friendly. Among their excellent sake selection, I apparently had the Otokoyama tokobetsu junmai sake which had a good mix of fruitiness and dryness (I apparently wrote something like banana in my old photo but I presume this was just a sweeter fruit flavor.)I started with an onigiri/rice ball with pork. I remembering it being alright. Flavorful pork but I think I remember it being a bit pricey and there wasn't that much pork inside. I also remember ordering the chicken ramen as my main and judging from when I had gone here, I likely was comparing it to Nakamura as I was much closer to here. The broth here by comparison was a lot lighter but the seasonings on the side helped. The egg was also just alright as well being much more well flavored in other spots. I did go back one other time and tried one of the pork ramen which was a lot better but still not noticeably better than other spots with the same not so good egg. If you're looking for a bowl late at night in this neighborhood, it's hard to argue with this spot. If you're looking for a light bowl, the chicken ramen would do it but I believe the pork is more their specialty. Also wouldn't recommend the onigiri much. Borderline mid 3 for the area and how late they stay open. Just stick to what they're known for."

We arrived at 12:10 for lunch and they open at 12. We were seated at the last table for two. Also there is only one person for all the tables. She was very efficient but i would say if you are in a rush then order to go. On to the important items the food. I ordered the black garlic ramen with spicy oil and the gyoza dumplings. It is called the lunch set and it was perfect if you are hungry. I am an eater so I ate everything. My coworker ordered the curry chicken katsu which he said was delicious. That was a huge portion and could easily be divided into two meals. My ramen was vey flavorful and I could taste the garlic. The broth was hot and when it arrived to the table could see the steam. The pieces of pork were quite large and not overly fatty which was great. I ordered the chili oil which was perfect to make it spicy. The amount of noodles were the right combination to broth and noodle. The texture of the noodles were the right firmness. The broth was rich and tasted as if it were boiling for a long time. The dumplings were good but a little greasy but the filling was ample. Also these dumplings were gyoza with wings which I never had before. This means that they have some of extra crispy skin. I would definitely come back here to try the other ramens and other dishes. I recommend this place and I'm glad I went here for lunch. The place is very nice, inside the decor. I felt as if I was transported back to Japan."

I was seated immediately around 6pm and had my ramen bowl served to me within 5 minutes of ordering! I ordered the red ramen. I was not impressed by the ramen; the charsu cuts, although large, were on the drier side with little flavoring. The toppings only included a piece of bak choy, diced white onions, green onions and 2 sheets of seaweed. Sadly, the broth was tasty but lacked umami. Portions were appropriate and price point was $15. The service was great as they turned around the tables in lightning speed. Clean and nicely decorated."

We had a couple unopened bottles of soda and the workers pretty much wanted to throw us out.  I said we won't drink them and they kept insisting that we can't have outside food or drink.  I left them on the table since I didn't have any bags with me.   My son was going to finish up his 2-3 bites of burger while we were going to order ramen and wait for it to come out but they wouldn't even let us do that.  I just ended up leaving with the sodas and leftover since they made me so uncomfortable.  Wife and son stayed but barely ate their ramen since they did not enjoy it."

2486,MulJEe-IjptlsWI4H_oxNA,10/31/2018,1 star rating,"Wow. Probably the worst place I have been to. All we wanted was some coffee on a crisp Sunday. While my mom waited for the coffee, we were sitting at the McDonald's tables. 20 minutes in, and no updates. My boyfriend went to check in and eventually switch places with my mom, so she could get a chance to sit. Another 15 minutes passed, and nothing has come up. We came in at around 5:20 PM, and 28 minutes has to pass before we could even get ONE cup of coffee. What a shame, considering we had ordered three cups of coffee. We were on a time crunch, so we had to settle for the sole cup of coffee and head out. However, I see my mom waiting at the front of the line, in desperate hope of getting the remaining 2 cups of coffee we ordered earlier. My boyfriend and I checked out the front of the line, and I noticed it just looked like a madhouse. Hangry customers almost to the point of fighting each other were packed closer together than Walmart sardines in a can. Somehow my boyfriend snakes his way through the front so he could ask the employee about the 2 remaining cups of coffee. Sensing the indignation in his tone, the employee quickly whipped up the 2 cups of coffee left and gave them to us. What a relief it was to leave that madhouse, only to notice the coffee order was wrong. 3 cups of coffee ordered, 2 cups delayed, and 1 cup was wrong. What a waste of 40 minutes - but I guess this is the type of service we should expect when in the Times Square area."
2487,MulJEe-IjptlsWI4H_oxNA,11/2/2019,1 star rating,"My review is mostly to talk about how an incident here happened and how it was handled-or not handled. My 1st time here was at 1am after work this evening. A crazed looking man 30-40's came in with a young woman in about her 20's at the same time as myself. He was verbally and physically abusive to her, but the supposed security at the door did nothing at all to help her and neither did any of the many male patrons, other than to meekly tell him to ""Leave her alone."" She was on the floor crawling at one point while he was hanging on to her leg. He also was strong-arming her shoulders to try to restrict her movement. As far as I know, I was the only one who took any action by calling 911 to try to get police to help the situation. The police arrived after both parties had left separately at different times, but still, I was pretty shocked no one tried to really seem to help the young lady other then myself by taking action to call the police. The only action I saw the supposed security take was to put a printout of a paper on the door saying ""THIS STORE WILL BE CLOSING AT 3AM"" after the man and woman had left. The staff at the register was very nice and my order came out correctly, although it took them about 15 minutes to put together my ""Fast Food."" The only person I saw trying to help the young woman at all after her crazy bf or friend had left was a man I later saw sweeping the floor, so I don't know if he was a manager or a porter. In contrast, The McDonald's on 8th Ave and 43rd that sadly closed had such a great security guy there that I never saw any incidents like this happening there, and he was more than willing to tell customers when they had to leave and was firm about it and handled situations. So, if you go here and get in any trouble or are assaulted, don't expect any help from the paid security here if that's what they really are standing at the door there, because the man there was not wearing a security uniform, etc., so I don't really know what his title was."

2494,MulJEe-IjptlsWI4H_oxNA,7/19/2018,3 star rating,"This McDonald's has a pretty poor floor plan, and as a result the experience is pretty chaotic. Seating is literally crammed in between large bearing beams, leaving little room for customers in line. The lines are rather disorganized, and it can be tough to know which line you are in, at any given time. The 'wait' area is just as chaotic and busy as you have to contort yourself and maneuver to get to the register to get your food.The service is pretty decent depending on when you go, but sometimes they get the order wrong, like they may forget to put the bacon on your sandwich, or give you the wrong sandwich, or forget the meat (Where's the beef?)! Speaking of the meat, I am pleased that this McDonald's sometimes uses ""fresh beef"", but this location doesn't cook the beef properly. The burgers are always pink inside, and I end up not being able to eat the entire burger. Make sure you check your burger before you leave, unless you want to upgrade to a Double Beef Parasite With Cheese.Not a terrible experience, but an unfortunate store layout, and under-cooked food takes it down a few notches."

I did not know what I wanted to order at first, but the staff was very friendly and recommended various items on the menu. I ended up ordering the General Tso's Chicken with the Egg Drop Soup. Not only did the food come quickly, but it also tasted amazing. I will definitely come back and order again!"

They prepare their dishes to your desires and specifications.  Their pricing is fair.  The owners live across the street from my in-laws so supporting local is in play here.  They work 16-18 hour days - and it's a family affair."

2504,f0VJirNbBXsS8Ihvv-Rs1g,10/20/2019,5 star rating,"Honestly, I was very skeptical before coming here because I traditionally don't eat out that much because I have a weak stomach. However, I ended up coming because of some previous reviews and it exceeded all of my expectations. The staff was very inviting and helpful with dish recommendations and prepared the food very quickly! The Chicken Broccoli dish tasted really authentic. As someone who's been to a quite a few takeout places in the past, the taste here doesn't compare. It's fresh and leaves you feeling good. And coming from someone who usually gets an upset stomach easily, I can attest to saying the food here left me feeling great and wanting more. I am definitely ranking this as one of my go to spots from now, and hope everyone else tries it out too!"

Once at the restaurant it turns out they can only do gluten free penne. You can get this with any sauce which ended up being no problem but it does rule out the Tortellini!"

2512,CIV1wpkbmpdMPDCl1lNWhQ,12/3/2021,3 star rating,We came here on Thanksgiving and were very disappointed. The food was super under-seasoned and the pre-fixed Thanksgiving meal was just not it. We were also surprised to see that they served the meal with mashed sweet potatoes instead of regular mashed potatoes. Sadly this was not advertised when we made our reservation.I also ordered caprese salad and they forgot to add the tomatoes which was super weird. How do you forget tomatoes for a tomato-mozarella dish? Service was very slow and we waited two hours to get our food. Our party was sat in one of the private back rooms and the heat in there was unbearable.I wouldn't come back here.

Not only was the food delicious but the staff was attentive and made our experience memorable. Fresh bread and olives were set in front of us immediately. We split the the roasted tomato caprese salad and Pappardelle with wild mushroom & truffle ragu topped with goat cheese. Portions were perfect!For dessert a cappuccino and tiramisu for the room because we were stuffed!

I'm sure it's common for that restaurant to get a lot of theatre goers, but still loved that he asked. He was very attentive and overall a very good waiter.The food was absolutely delicious. My mom and I shared the pan fried baby artichokes which were my favorite dish of the entire meal. It was sautéed artichoke hearts with shaved Parmesan on top, with a lemon on the side. For our entrees I got the scallops and my mom got the penne eggplant, again both of which were absolutely delicious. My scallops were a small dish, as they usually are, and they were seared to perfection. They were a little small but I didn't mind, displayed in a circle with a lightly dressed salad in the middle.I absolutely loved this restaurant and definitely plan on returning again!"

It was after the matinee but before the evening rush. I did't think it would be a problem to get a table at this time but they were expecting a larger crowd but were able to seat me. I received a glass of tap water and some Italian bread with a delicious white bean spread. After checking the menu again, I ordered the fichi pizza, a decent sized pizza with black mission figs, gorgonzola cheese, arugula, prosciutto and walnuts. It was very good and filling. At the end of my meal, I ordered a double espresso which was great as well. The restroom was clean and well maintained. The waitress was very accommodating and attentive. I would recommend and return."

I usually do not order pasta but I did and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  Pasta with sausage and broccoli; a nice portion and not overwhelming.  We shared a dessert as the finishing touch."

2520,9mawr6QwVHm5q8JRXPFjPA,1/12/2017,4 star rating,"A very solid choice on restaurant row. We went after the theater crowd had left, and as expected across the row, the food & service pick up nicely. We started with the garlic pizza bread, which is not exactly as expected...more of a garlic pappadam than a pizza crust, but very tasty. Main course was the thinly sliced calf liver with pancetta, excellent flavor with no tough spots to be found anywhere. The side dish was brussels sprouts, which were perfectly crispy and quite tasty. The raspberry sorbet to finish was quite good as well. Wine selection is minimal, but the bottle of nebbiolo was priced right and tasted just fine. Overall price is right in line with expectations (for post-theater seating), and the ambience of the space is quite good. Conversations can be had without having to tune out loud music or patrons. Service is a just average. Our waiter, while making decent recommendations, alternated between just polite enough and just averagely attentive."
2521,9mawr6QwVHm5q8JRXPFjPA,11/5/2014,5 star rating,"This is a perfect restaurant for a pre-theatre dinner. The food is delicious, the portions are ideal (filling but not overbearing), and the atmosphere is lovely. The restaurant is small but it is quaint, peaceful, and has the most beautiful plates and cups. Seriously though, I plan on buying the same brand for my own kitchen!As for the actual meal itself, the food is really fantastic. They start you off with some bread and white bean dip, which is incredibly addicting. I challenge you not to get seconds... and thirds. For my main dish, I order the large maltagliata pasta dish. The pasta was well-cooked and the mushrooms really tasty and not overbearing at all. I hate when pasta dishes are too heavy and I feel immobile afterwards; that's not the case here. It's a nice, light pasta dish you will surely enjoy. Beyond the pasta, I also shared the margherita pizze and that was also delicious, shockingly good even. It may have been the best pizza I've had when dining in at an Italian restaurant. The ingredients were very fresh, the crust was light and crisp, and it had a lovely balance between the cheese and sauce. Definitely a nice option for sharing with the table!On top of that, the service is great and the coffee is awesome. You can't go wrong with dinner at orso."
2522,9mawr6QwVHm5q8JRXPFjPA,12/22/2018,4 star rating,"On ""Restaurant Row"" (46 St., Theater District), we had lunch at Orso before seeing a Broadway Show. My wife enjoyed the mussels in a tomato sauce and I ordered the spagetti with marinara sauce and eggplant (without the burrata it's offered with), but it was only about 10% eggplant - otherwise very good. What stole the show, however, was dessert. I can't recall having a better tiramisu, so soft in the middle it was almost dripping wet and razor thin strips of chocolate on top. My wife ordered the fresh fruit and it was red grapes, strawberries, honeydew and pineapple - all perfectly ripe. Both desserts were large enough to split four ways. I also enjoyed my double-shot capuccino. It was expensive, but not crazy. Nice atmosphere too."
2523,9mawr6QwVHm5q8JRXPFjPA,8/1/2016,2 star rating,"For those searching for a reliable theater district meal -- keep looking.  Orso is an average restaurant boasting higher prices than the food or service supports.  Mediocre food pairs appropriately with an uninspiring drink / wine list. The appetizers are swiming in cheese to mask the true flavors of the dishes, the portions of which are probably 20% too small to justify their prices.  Main dishes are likewise disappointing. The Black Spaghetti should be a home run but instead is coated in pungent film. The pasta, crab, and hot oil should blend together.  Instead, they seem to be fighting each other.  The smell is unappetizing and evokes images of picnicking beside the Gowanus Canal.  The skirt steak is wet with some type of coating that renders the steak useless and unrecognizable. Saving the restaurant from one star is the service, which is professional and pleasant."

The last two visits have been a complete disaster, and why I say two is because the first time the service started to change, I decided to try it one more time only for the same thing to happen. I used to love this place when visiting for family dinner/lunch, but it has changed so much. Everything has changed so much it seems to me that everything's rushed to accommodate the high demand of the restaurant, which in turn give lousy food quality and service not like how it used to be and the servers are rude. And I'm not just saying that my last two experience rude servers both times; table busers / cleaners were way more likable. Around me had tables getting wrong orders just chaotic and destructive for a Friday at 6 pm"

Always loved how it gave family vibes . My recent visit after I got the bill I notice my bill said my drink was 34$ which was insane for the size that I got . I've never in my life paid that much for a drink that size even in the most expensive places .  Yes I understand with covid prices are rising but I feel like that is a little overboard . Seis vecinos used to be affordable but a 140$ bill at a restaurant that is local is a  little insane . Sorry to say I think I won't be back . ( my sisters drink was 28$ and it was Long Island ) also a price of one taco was 9 bucks ! That's almost 10$! A taco .

It was during lunch and they had a surprisingly good amount of people there! I thought that was a great sign and am always happy to see businesses busy, especially in the Bronx. I seat myself down and browse the menu. A guy ended up coming over to take my order. The the waitress comes over (not that nice either) asking about my order. i let her know he took it already. I specifically told him...bring out my papusas first then my taco salad. Of course it came together. smh. Papusas were pretty bangin. Now maybe Covid got the best of me but it freaked me the f*ck out with the large onions on the table and the cabbage also. They both are in large glass jars. Ummmm I'm sorry but how do you know what people did prior to you eating out of that jar? NO, there is no way only one table uses it because those jars are huge. Not going to lie i still put the cabbage on my papusas because I can't eat without it. lol.  The taco salad was pretty good. I personally like a stronger taco shell to scoop my salad on but this was much thinner. Take note: the waiter didn't come back one time to ask how everything was. Also, I waited SO LONG for my check that I actually had to get up and ask the guy outside if he was the owner. In which he responded no but my cousin is. What I find strange about him telling me that is i saw him on social media pushing the vaccine. So if he isn't that important than why is he the face of the restaurant? He goes in and tells someone and they come with the check. No ""sorry for the wait""- nothing. i LOVE finding great spots in the Bronx because I feel we are often overlooked when it comes to food. It left such a bad taste in my mouth, I am truly mind blown they were as busy as they were. Will not be rushing back here to eat but may get papusas for takeout."

We opted for the ceviche,   and ordered the rest of our food.

I've mainly ordered from them through the Too Good To Go app, so my review is based on these experiences.  They are located on the 3rd floor of the mall at Columbus Circle. The to-go area is to the left of the escalators, and there is a dine-in area to the right, complete with a small bar. The staff is pretty friendly, and the woman behind the counter even asked if I had any allergies-- which is not mandatory for TGTG orders, but was an exceptionally nice touch.  I got a few of their mini-baguette sandwiches-- Brie + fig and ham & cheese. So tasty!!"

Upon raising this issue- the young baristas acknowledge the lack of warmth whatsoever in my cup and said they would make another one. Ok.So my partner waited and watched the barista just poured the original warm latte back into the steamer and instructed her to have the frother at full blast. (He is a coffee snob and studies coffee for fun)The second time- my latte was at about 175. Whatever. I'll take it over this agony of trying to teach the kids behind the counter because it was obvious that no one has. His regular coffee was sour. Again he explained to me because they hav 0 idea what they are doing back there. The apple tart was cold, possibly vendor but possibly fresh at 8am- dunno- it was requisite all things considering. The most mind boggling thing? We'd both been here several occasions intermittently through the years and only such a subpar experience would recall other awful same experiences in the past- HERE.Yet we keep coming back. Yet they keep getting business. Bc tartinery has a monopoly at the mall. A cafe or 2 needs to open up in this mall to put Tartinery out of its misery pronto."

2541,oYmpJ1OXiYGr5IYSxlmGcw,11/14/2021,2 star rating,"IMPORTANT INFO: So, if you are planning on sitting with someone, or getting work done, this is pertinent. This Tartinery is split into two separate seating areas. One is connected to the kitchen, with a line of small standing tables, and the other is detached, with larger tables for talking/working (cafe-sized). I ordered from the kitchen, and waited in line to sit in the area with larger tables. I was hoping to get some work done on the desks while I drank coffee and...ordered more food.The host was incredibly friendly, and after cleaning the table and sitting me down, another employee came out and actually got angry that I sat down. He let me know that I had already ordered so I was NOT going to be able to sit at the table anymore. I'm not sure what traumatic experience he had with people sitting down, but he picked violence almost immediately. Another employee let him know that it was fine and that I was going to order food. He got mildly embarrassed and then doubled down and raised his voice.Everyone just kind of freezes and watches. Thankfully, we could all experience this together. Mind you, I literally just stood there smiling, as I got yelled at, for choosing to sit down. The vibe was BAD. I left because everyone was uncomfortable, and I felt the eyes of endless pity watch me find seating elsewhere. Oddly enough, no one needed the table. He just...felt like taking out his anger on someone? I work in food service and it was the first time I've ever seen the actual employee pull a Karen on a customer. The croque monsieur I ordered was pretty good. Just be aware that you might have a very turbulent experience eating your little pastry."

2543,oYmpJ1OXiYGr5IYSxlmGcw,3/11/2021,4 star rating,"I've had this place bookmarked since it opened last month, and I finally got to go yesterday to try them out.  Located on the third floor of The Shops at Columbus Circle, away from the hustle and bustle of the first two floors, Tartinery offers fast casual dining with wonderful views of Central Park.  The café has mostly high café table seating but there is also a separate section called The Bar, with linen covered tables and small bar, assumingly serving alcohol.  Since I do not really drink, I immediately went to the café section to order my food. The menu offers lots of French pastries, salads, smoothies, craft coffee and desserts, but the main focus of this little café is the tartine, or the open-faced sandwich.  I ordered two different tartines, one savory and one sweet. I got the Smoked Salmon tartine ($18.50) with crème fraiche, capers and radish.  It was really delicious, ingredients tasted fresh, and they definitely did not skimp on the smoked salmon. And then I also ordered the Nutella tartine ($9) with caramelized bananas.  This was actually my favorite of the two.  I thought the Nutella with the warm caramelized bananas on sourdough bread was a great combination.The food is here really good, but you definitely pay for location. I would recommend coming anytime from 11am to 5pm when they offer the lunch combo.  For $12.50, you can get your choice of soup and small tartine.  If you go after 5pm, the full sized tartines are $14-$18.50."

I've mainly ordered from them through the Too Good To Go app, so my review is based on these experiences.  They are located on the 3rd floor of the mall at Columbus Circle. The to-go area is to the left of the escalators, and there is a dine-in area to the right, complete with a small bar. The staff is pretty friendly, and the woman behind the counter even asked if I had any allergies-- which is not mandatory for TGTG orders, but was an exceptionally nice touch.  I got a few of their mini-baguette sandwiches-- Brie + fig and ham & cheese. So tasty!!"

Upon raising this issue- the young baristas acknowledge the lack of warmth whatsoever in my cup and said they would make another one. Ok.So my partner waited and watched the barista just poured the original warm latte back into the steamer and instructed her to have the frother at full blast. (He is a coffee snob and studies coffee for fun)The second time- my latte was at about 175. Whatever. I'll take it over this agony of trying to teach the kids behind the counter because it was obvious that no one has. His regular coffee was sour. Again he explained to me because they hav 0 idea what they are doing back there. The apple tart was cold, possibly vendor but possibly fresh at 8am- dunno- it was requisite all things considering. The most mind boggling thing? We'd both been here several occasions intermittently through the years and only such a subpar experience would recall other awful same experiences in the past- HERE.Yet we keep coming back. Yet they keep getting business. Bc tartinery has a monopoly at the mall. A cafe or 2 needs to open up in this mall to put Tartinery out of its misery pronto."

The sever would not let me have one even though the place half empty.  He was smug and rude and we left. Management take note.

2551,ByIhI19_bVFl5koNk0ylpw,11/14/2021,2 star rating,"IMPORTANT INFO: So, if you are planning on sitting with someone, or getting work done, this is pertinent. This Tartinery is split into two separate seating areas. One is connected to the kitchen, with a line of small standing tables, and the other is detached, with larger tables for talking/working (cafe-sized). I ordered from the kitchen, and waited in line to sit in the area with larger tables. I was hoping to get some work done on the desks while I drank coffee and...ordered more food.The host was incredibly friendly, and after cleaning the table and sitting me down, another employee came out and actually got angry that I sat down. He let me know that I had already ordered so I was NOT going to be able to sit at the table anymore. I'm not sure what traumatic experience he had with people sitting down, but he picked violence almost immediately. Another employee let him know that it was fine and that I was going to order food. He got mildly embarrassed and then doubled down and raised his voice.Everyone just kind of freezes and watches. Thankfully, we could all experience this together. Mind you, I literally just stood there smiling, as I got yelled at, for choosing to sit down. The vibe was BAD. I left because everyone was uncomfortable, and I felt the eyes of endless pity watch me find seating elsewhere. Oddly enough, no one needed the table. He just...felt like taking out his anger on someone? I work in food service and it was the first time I've ever seen the actual employee pull a Karen on a customer. The croque monsieur I ordered was pretty good. Just be aware that you might have a very turbulent experience eating your little pastry."

On the weekends, they have a dj who starts playing later in the evening.  I've only had drinks including a glass of Sancerre and old fashion and both were up to standard .  The service is pretty good but could improve a tad bit by not having to get their attention for drinks, etc.  overall , I enjoy coming here as it's close my house and is accessible by the subway for friends."

We had an amazing time; the apps were delicious, and the drinks are probably one of the best cocktails I ever had in NYC. The DJ was good, the environment, the crowd, the VIEW ! Great new years for us! Today I came here to celebrate my friend's  birthday. The cocktails are a bit on the pricey side however you get what you pay for, it will be worth EVERY cent. I am sure everybody has been to numerous establishments where they probably charge you 3 dollars less than the price at Ascent and you feel like it wasn't even worth 5 bucks or just a waste of $. If you want to have GREAT, UNIQUE, DELICIOUS cocktails with a great ambience & service: THIS IS YOUR PLACE. If you go here and order a beer, ofc you won't be impressed as it's going to taste just like the beer you can get at the Deli and you will feel like you overpaid. TRY THEIR COCKTAILS !!! Also, please do not go expecting restaurant food, believe me; if it was known for their food it would be called ASCENT RESTAURANT not LOUNGE. The appetizers are so delicious ! The shrimp dumplings, chicken sliders, burger sliders, mac & cheese balls, pizza, omg everything was perfect ! The service literally makes the experience worth coming as well, everyone there are super polite, respectful & kind. MATIJA, DAYSI, DASHA, ELIAS, sorry if I cannot remember all the names but they're all wonderful. This is the perfect place to go for a nice after work outing, a date, a friend's reunion, etc. You will not feel rushed, you can sit, relax cand catch up peacefully without feeling like you must keep consuming to stay in the establishment. I cannot speak for private events as I have not yet planned one."

I called and everything seemed fine the host was inviting I went in for a cocktail and went home. I was excited about the vibe because at that time I encountered a mix crowd with good music. I was dressed down.Fast forward to 3/19 and the entire atmosphere has changed immediately upon arrival with another female friend the hostess leans over her stand look us up and down then get the manager without saying a word. This tall linky Eastern European white man proceeds to come out shake his head and say No! Confused we ask what are you talking about he then states that no Athletic gear on Saturday so me with my plain skippies and my friend with her ""super Athletic Jordan's"" couldn't sit at the bar.... I advise that I was just there a couple of weeks ago and this was never mentioned anywhere on the website nor was a requirement. Matija Rajak then tells me one of the owners came in last Friday and seen ""the people"" inside and was really mad and implemented the rules. Now let me reiterate when I first visited the establishment I was excited to see such a mix of people in which made me want to tell other people about this place and plan events, where there was such a colorful mix of people. My return was met by the unt unt jersey crowd and not much else because it was actually empty. I was told the other white patrons was allowed to have on sneakers because they came in before 8pm I arrived at 8:15pm.After deciding to take my money else where to the piano bar directly across from ascent I casually watch the same host and manager let in loads of white people in with shorts, tennis shoes, docks and other seemingly athletic gear.... A total disgrace and I advise anyone who like to be treated with respect and equality to go elsewhere.... Do better!!!! This is New York City we're not accepting the passive aggressive racism nor classism BS anymore! This city is one of the most diverse cities in the world to come here and post up shop is to accept and honor that diversity! After the Pandemic it's amazing to see some of the hardest hit industries try to sneakily regress back into low tier scummy policies that had y'all practically begging to stay afloatLastly me and the other black yelper have no affiliation at all!

Nothing changed. No go on the bathroom attendants - it's 2022 - I've legit never met a person who goes into a bathroom and is like ""oh good, a bathroom attendant!""Usually we're all just met with pounding anxiety because we have to tip them and nobody carries cash anymore."

Despite probably being the youngest patrons there, a friend and I found comfort at sitting at the bar and watching the cocktails be made up close!Yes, the drinks are expensive but they are so well-crafted. We were always treated great by Fidel and Matija who went above and beyond to start recommending unique drinks they thought we'd like by remembering our past orders. Not sure if they are still at Ascent, but if they are, you're in great hands!Cant wait to return; miss it here!"

If this seems like hyperbole, I assure you it's not. Just ask Time Magazine, Bon Appétit, Food & Wine Magazine, Time Out, Food Network, Goldbelly, New York Magazine, New York Daily News, Eater, Forbes, The Rachel Ray Show and the list goes on. All have featured Little Pie Co and their award winning apple pie. You don't get that much recognition for being pretty good or even great. You have to be freaking outstanding and this pie is just that. So next time you're in NYC and craving something sweet, go to Little Pie Co, order the sour cream apple walnut pie warm and prepare to have your mind blown . Bottom line: Highly acclaimed, highly publicized, and highly likely to blow your mind (especially when served warm). Highly recommend."

It's the best apple pie I've ever had and one of the best desserts in NYC, full stop. Especially when it's served warm (an option you should always request). If this seems like hyperbole, I assure you it's not. Just ask Time Magazine, Bon Appétit, Food & Wine Magazine, Time Out, Food Network, Goldbelly, New York Magazine, New York Daily News, Eater, Forbes, The Rachel Ray Show and the list goes on. All have featured Little Pie Co and their award winning apple pie. You don't get that much recognition for being pretty good or even great. You have to be freaking outstanding and this pie is just that. So next time you're in NYC and craving something sweet, go to Little Pie Co, order the sour cream apple walnut pie warm and prepare to have your mind blown . Bottom line: Highly acclaimed, highly publicized, and highly likely to blow your mind (especially when served warm). Highly recommend."
2585,VzHdgvEv9bx9RVrNbhsmQw,3/15/2022,4 star rating,"The Little Pie Company is in fact a little place with little pies (and some bigger ones too). I got a Sugarless Apple Pie, which was pretty good! The crust was nicely baked to a golden color. As the name of the pie suggests, it is a relatively healthy option, but as a result, it was not quite as sweet as I would've liked (I guess that's what I get for trying to be healthy). It was also kind of airy on the inside, so they definitely could've had some more apples in there. I'd say the pie was a fair size for $10.The interior has a couple seats for seating, but seems like most people take the pies to go. The staff are average friendliness.Overall, I enjoyed my pie and would recommend Little Pie Company to other pie fans as well."

I think the crust and the perimeter of the pie can be more crispy, especially the base of the pie. There was too much apples in the pie. I think they can make a smaller version of pie and the taste would be better. The apples soaked the pie, making it less tasty and more soggy.

It's the closest I will get to being close to Ronnie since I'm too poor to afford his clothing. Luckily I like food more than clothes, particularly ice cream."

Hmm... 15.. 10 years ago, I wouldn't have envisioned a place like this in Brooklyn, but I've adjusted to the ""New Brooklyn"".This past weekend it was a pretty nice day, and I decided to finally decided to give this place a shot. I walk in, an employee immediately walks over, and inquires whether I've been there before-- she begins to explain the concept, but I was already familiar. I opted for two Ice Cream Swirls (one ice cream and one mix in along with three scoops of ice cream). I went with Apple Jacks & Snickers; it was pretty good, but it's a lot of ice cream, way more than I expected and you don't really taste the cereal much.I saw reviews complaining about the cost, but you get a lot of ice cream for the price and I think it's well worth it. The place seemed very clean, very nice staff, and I enjoy d the product. The way my current eating habits are set up, this won't be something I eat on a regular basis, however, I anticipate coming by once again before th summer ends!FYI: there's no seating inside-- however, they have two benches outside. Unfortunately, ppl often use it to wait for the bus along Flatbush Avenue."

They have so many cereal choices that you are able to blend into some of the creamiest ice cream you'll ever have. They also have suggested blends of different cereals and treats that they think are good too! This is definitely a place I like to bring friends and family to try and so far everyone loves it !

I had to try/see it with my own eyes. Great shoe store, but I specifically came for the ice cream... sorry not sorry. The wall was filled with so many cereal options it was overwhelming. I wanted to get the one by Victor Cruz because we went to college together, but I was in the mood for ice cream, so I tried the vanilla ice cream with cocoa puffs and the s'mores crunch crumble instead. Took my first bite and it was so good I wanted to shove the whole thing in my mouth. We all know cereal is great on it's own, but their vanilla ice cream is so smooth and creamy! Perfect combo. Everyone was friendly and the cereal ice cream was delicious, but I probably would not go back again unless I'm really craving cereal and don't have any in the pantry... or want to spend over $7 for cereal..."
2631,fanlKZzN-fI9LywqQD6EHg,10/9/2016,5 star rating,"When I first came here I was not sure what to expect of this place since it was inside a clothing/shoe store. They have an area where you can either cereal boxes or ice cream, I have never tired the cereal boxes but have been here a couple of times for the ice cream. There isn't anywhere for you to sit but there is an area for you to stand and you can eat your ice cream there or you can go outside to the bench in the front of the store. For the ice cream which you can choose one cereal and one topping to mix with vanilla ice cream and they mix it together for you. There is so many choices both cereal and ice cream. My personal favorite mix is the cookie crispy cereal with s'mores topping, but I've tired a variety of the toppings and they taste pretty bomb. (I don't think you can go wrong with cereal ice cream tbh). The amount of ice cream is extremely generous for only about $6 (including tax), which I think is pretty worth it since it is so TASTY. Although, I have noticed that the amount of ice cream is different each time I have came here, but not complaining since sometimes I get a lot but sometimes not so much but either way the amount is always worth the price so I'm a pretty happy camper. The staff is always extremely nice and helpful and it is just a great experience every time I come here. Whenever I am near Atlantic and I am craving ice cream this is def. the place I usually go too."

There's a million sneaker/shoe stores throughout Brooklyn so I'd see Kith's and keep right on going lol. I was 9 months pregnant when Hubby and I decided to walk from Crown Heights to downtown Brooklyn to help jump start my labor. While walking down Flatbush Avenue I do a double take and see people walking around Kiths in front of the store eating ice cream...GASP! And not just ice cream, I see old school cereal flavors in the window BIG EYES! I have to see what this store truly is, part sneaker store, part ice cream shop? Whatever, I'm down! I try the Apple Jacks and Vanilla swirl on a blue corn flake waffle corn....Oooooomgee...tears of joy!! Hubby didn't exactly have the same reaction but who told him cinnamon toast crunch was a good flavor to mix LOL. Needless to say this is my go to spot when I'm near Barclays Center, can't wait to try a new flavor during my next visit!"
2633,fanlKZzN-fI9LywqQD6EHg,7/21/2016,3 star rating,"Meh. So, the whole ice cream with mix-ins deal really appealed to me because it reminded me of a soft-serve place we used to have back in my hometown where we could get frozen fruit mix-ins for a really refreshing, completely customized frozen dessert. That was the extent of my fascination with this place. Otherwise, I think it is totally and unnecessarily overhyped on social media. I chose the fruity pebbles cereal mix in and the snickers bar toppings and I thought the combination went together really well. Everything was thoroughly mixed and the end product looked - in the best way possible - like unicorn poop. I bet unicorn poop tastes at least as delicious as my soft serve did! Unfortunately, there are no options for frozen fruit toppings, but given the concept of the store, it's understandable.The whole set up of the place is odd, tbh. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to eat my dessert standing at the counter, or if I could walk into the adjacent store, or if I could sit in the alcoves, or if I should just leave. This lack of seating and standing room really didn't make for a great experience, but if you are in the area and just want to pop by for a dessert to eat while walking, then this might be a good option for you."

So I took my little people for a treat after school and we were definitely pleasantly pleased. The kids had the Lucky Charms and I had my ice cream infused with Cap'n Crunch!!!! Omgeeeeee, nostalgia on level 1000!The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they should offer kid sizes so it can be presented nice and pretty (I had my children split one and my daughter wasn't pleased that she lost her swirl). Oye. But trust me, get some of the KITH cereal infused ice cream. It's awesome!"

I've been wanting to try Sushi On Me for a while now, and finally snagged reservations for the 5:00pm seating on a Wed. The meal was 15 courses, all delicious, and I loved the fact that Thai flavors that would occasionally make an appearance (the chefs are Thai). Sake flows freely, and the team behind the counter really know how to create a really fun and enjoyable experience. My recommendation: make a reservation and go as soon as you can!"
2636,R1OlpKHgFM4wW8f_UtGf4w,12/11/2022,5 star rating,"A friend found this sushi place and when I heard the name, I thought this was going to be one of those places where you eat sushi off of women lying on tables. It is really a thing and it is called Nyotaimori. Look it up if you don't believe me and NO, I would never do it. But I digress. So this is not that kind of place but it is also not your typical sushi omakase experience. This is apparent from the moment you walk in and there is 80's music blasting out of large speakers and a neon sign to ""Enjoy your f------ dinner"". But it is a blast and if you can get reservations, grab it. But even before you walk in, you have to find the entrance which was not easy because when Waze or Maps takes you to the address, you may still be confused until you realize that it is in the basement.Get there a little earlier than your reservation because you will want to take pics and talk to the chefs and the staffs. They are a hoot! As for the good, we got 15 dishes and they were all awesome! I will not list them all as I included descriptions in the pictures but the highlights for me were the fatty tuna sandwich, sea eel with Penang curry, white tuna with chili garlic and the mochi dessert. But they change dishes every time and there are no substitutions so your dishes may be completely different. I assume though that they will always incorporate Thai and other Asian influences in their dishes, which makes the meal so different from other omakase meals. That and the ridiculously fun atmosphere, which is augmented by the UNLIMITED sake!"

We did the omakase, which was $89 when we visited in early December. I was skeptical that it was all a schtick, but the guys were genuinely nice and it was a truly fun time. Plus, the sushi was actually great! I won't give too much away, but it exceeded my expectations and the price point is perfect. Don't think - just go."

The multi course dinner was very tasteful and tingled my taste buds that I didn't even know existed. Some courses I preferred more than others; some courses were more extravagant that others. Overall, each dish complemented one another. The service was impeccable. These men aren't just sushi chefs; they are entertainers! The service felt genuine, and my needs were catered to professionally, despite the many curse words said in excitement and in entertainment! Love the loud music, visually appealing ambiance. With all the unlimited sake that they served me, I was feeling so euphoric once the Rihanna songs came on full-blast. 10 out of 10 recommend."

There was live music one of the two times which I really enjoyed. The vibes are so right here. Free, unlimited sake, very enthusiastic staff. Such an entertaining experience. You do need to book in advance, especially for larger groups. There's about 12 seats at the bar. The selection is absolutely divine. Price is so worth, $89.I've usually been able to get street parking within 1 block. Entrance is down a set of stairs. CASH ONLY!There is an ATM either in the restaurant or closeby (can't remember)"

Both experiences don't just feel like a meal, but the staff really puts on a whole show and party-like atmosphere so that you're entertained the whole time. You no longer just have to awkwardly eat sitting right next to another group at the omakase bar; you will all be constantly cheersing your sake shots on the house, and your delectable unique dishes from the omakase set! Fish was fresh and fatty. I love their special chili oil sauce that they top on some dishes. The fatty tuna, scallop, and salmon will for sure impress you!The only thing is that if you're not a fan of some vulgarity when it comes to language and jokes, Sushi On Me might not be the vibe for you.

Starting with it being a speakeasy makes it exciting. The experience from beginning to end is phenomenal. The dishes served had so much flavor and the presentation of the dishes were beautifully done. Did i mention it's UNLIMITED SAKE. You will leave this place lit and full !! Make sure you book your reservations on OpenTable ahead of time because they fill up fast. Don't be scared to add yourself to the waitlist because it works!! That's how i got in.

Note: they take CASH only! The moment you walk in- you already know you will be having a great time! It had such an amazing speakeasy clubbing vibe. The staff were fun, amazing and interactive. They really know how to have a good time and made the whole experience so much better! Their playlist consisted of old school throwbacks and after a few rounds of sake- you are guaranteed to go into karaoke mode!The CBD bubble and the use of a THC smoke machine for two of their appetizers was what stole the show! You can also taste the thai influence in some of their dishes, which made each piece super unique!This place is definitely worth the hype!

2644,R1OlpKHgFM4wW8f_UtGf4w,2/16/2023,5 star rating,"You come here for the experience. I like that they take omakase - an experience that is usually elegant - and make it raunchy. They say 'fuck' here more often than I typically here the word in a year. It feels a bit forced, but I like changing the idea of omakase experience should be. I like that they made it their own but wish the personality of chefs and staff came out more rather focusing on fuckery. I hope to see more restaurants where the atmosphere and experience is more of a reflection of the individuals part of the business rather than what society expects the restaurant to be. I remember the appetizer course best. We started with an oyster topped with ikura and fried shallots. Fried shallots dominated the flavor. The texture of the ikura was quite nice. They had a good burst when you bite into them and they were included several times more throughout the meal.Next was a chopped spicy toro served on toasted white bread with black caviar on top. Didn't get too much flavor from the caviar. I think it was overpowered by the toast and the tuna. After that came a charred white fish served in a curry broth. Probably one of the richer and most flavorful items of the tasting. Following appetizer was a white fish with ikura in what I believe was a yuzu sauce. Music was loud, so it was tough to catch exactly what everything was.The last appetizer was the most controversial. It was smoked salmon with fried shallots and chilis served in a unstemmed wine glass a bright and citrusy sauce. They proceed to fill the glass the cannabis vapors. Some patrons chose to take the hit while others allowed the vapors to dissipate. I decided to indulge and found the rest of my experience to be a bit too impaired to fully enjoy. I cut myself the unlimited sake and opted for the unlimited water. The waiter was very kind to keep me topped off with water. I think he noticed I was out of my element after the hit and checked in a couple times.After the appetizer, came the sushi and hand roll course. My experience for this part of the dinner was impaired from the handful of sake and the cannabis that I had. I remember having lean tuna, fatty tuna, scallop, and I believe snapper and fluke. It became a bit tough to concentrate on the food with flooding of thoughts I was having. One thing I remember that irked me was that another patron was allergic to scallops. They accommodated her request but joked around a bit about whether they served her scallop or a substitute. I could see a customer going down a unpleasant rabbit hole facing that joke after having smoked a bit.Service wise, the operation is run very smoothly. The group was seated right on time at 5 and everyone was efficiently out right after 6, so the team could prepare for the next seating. Timing of the dishes was perfect and the waiter who went by Sake Boy made sure everyone's water and sake glasses were always filled. There was one gender neutral restroom. Unfortunately, they business does not seem to be handicap accessible as it's located down a flight of stairs on the basement level. I'm not sure if there is an alternate entrance."

We live in the neighborhood and always see people dining here. To be honest, our dine in experience was mediocre. The pizza was room temperature when it was brought to our table and the breading itself was a tad soggy and didn't hold. We were truly disappointed. We decided to give them another try and ordered the sausage and pepperoni pizza for delivery. The pizza this time around wasn't soggy and was able to hold. After heating it up in the oven for 5 mins, it was perfect. I won't say this is my favorite pizza spot in the area, but the flavor is solid and if you don't mind reheating the pizza for a few minutes prior to eating it, then I would recommend ordering from Patsys only for takeout."

Service was a bit slow but they were really busy. After a year of homemade pizzas, I was ecstatic to have an artisanal thin crusted margarita pizza. The pizza was amazing. Fried calamari was very crispy and seasoned well. My favorite item on the menu was the dessert - the tartufo. I normally order tiramisu but the table next to me ordered the tartufo. It's vanilla and chocolate ice cream in a chocolate shell topped with chocolate sauce. Perfect dessert to end the meal on a hot summer day."

Decided to come back for a second chance recently. They were fairly empty for a Friday night, plenty of open tables, they have an enclosed yard in the back and patio seating in front of the restaurant as well. Ordered a margherita pizza with half pepperoni, chicken parm with penne and a dozen baked clams. Our food came altogether really quickly after we ordered. The pizza is super thin crusted, the half with pepperoni was soggier/floppier than the side without. This was a solid pie, thin and crispy for the most part. The chicken parm entree was pretty big, lots of cheese on the chicken cutlet, a good portion of penne comes with it, cooked al dente. The dozen clams were good as well, baked with lots of breadcrumbs. The prices on the menu is the price if you pay cash, they charge a bit more if you pay with card, and they add an automatic gratuity of 16% for parties of 2 or more."

It's served with lentils, greens and a mustard sauce.Our guests had tuna tartare and the mussels with fries. The only feedback I got was from the mussels-eater, who complained that it was too hard to get at the sauce. She shelled basically every mussel and then let the meat marinate a bit before eating.There was a jazz trio jamming when we went, on a Tuesday night.

I saw there were Korean, Mexican, sandwiches, sushi, pizza, and a small market area to get beverages and desserts. Prices are a bit high, but it is a pretty nice and trendy food court. If you are visiting the WTC, this is a good stop, especially if you have hungry ones who don't want to walk a few extra blocks to visit one of the many restaurants in the south Manhattan area. I opted for sushi, which was amazingly delicious. Fresh fish prepared at the level expected of nicer sit down restaurants. The rest of my group got tacos and burritos, which smelled delicious. Judging from how fast they ate, they liked their food too. Before we left, I was able to grab a bottle of sparking water to take on the road from the market.

We didn't really order food this time except the coffee, next time I will and upload some photos. But good looks pretty good. Especially, grilled cheese sandwich. Service was good. Was hard to find a sitting but the host helped us out to get a seat easily. Will definitely recommend it. Fun place."
2677,m9Ud-Z_3AnRca9gUe95crQ,4/12/2022,5 star rating,"Boris & Horton is a cute dog cafe in East Village, NYC. People bring their own dogs to play with other dogs in the neighborhood. The cafe is on the other side of the seating area with typical coffee drinks, avocado toasts, and pastries. The two distinct areas, cafe vs dogs, are separated by two doors to prevent dogs from exiting on their own. It's the best place for dog lovers and to enjoy the accompaniment of four legged friends. There is a pet store in the middle of the shop selling dog clothes, treats, and toys. The experience was great; the latte and toasts were delicious. I suggest ordering the Tomato Hummus on Sourdough."

I came to B&H for the first time a month after getting my first puppy, Chai. We were both scared of how the night would go but we ended up having the best time at the event scheduled there. We went to a few more Italian Greyhound/Sighthound focused events over the few months after that and it gave my puppy and I so much peace of mind - she was able to break out of her shell and socialize in a (beautiful) closed off space, and I was able to keep a close eye on her while sipping on B&H Malbec!Flash forward to summer of this year: I wanted to throw Chai her first birthday party, and Logan (B&H's owner) was more than accommodating and kind during our conversations. We were able to rent out the space in advance for Chai's birthday and pre-ordered a cake from B&H's partner, Maison De Paws. Logan let us decorate the space however we wanted for Chai's birthday, and it ended up being the highlight of our year. 25+ people and dogs came - we ate, drank, and celebrated thanks to B&H's incredible food and drink menu and helpful staff. Since Chai's party, we have come back at least 5 times (including for their amazing Halloween bash) and we will continue to come back. I couldn't be happier with the service here, both for private events and on normal days, and we really love it here."

The ordering system in place is super convenient for the hectic environment (order on app/site and pick up alert when ready) so you don't miss a beat with your pup! They host various events at this dog cafe such as doggy yoga/pilates, breed meetups, artist events, birthday parties and more. It's a real community focused cafe which is so lovey!Only downside is that it's pretty far from the subway so it's a bit of a trek for my pup and I  Wish we lived closer to this gem of a spot!"

I was going to get one of the chocolate babka's, but my husband kind of nudged me towards the cinnamon raisin. So we went for that one instead of the normal chocolate babka's. We also snagged a rugelach and a croissant. We didnt get a chance to try the rugelach and croissant till we were on our way home the next morning. And they were both fantastic. The croissant was so buttery and delicious. The cinnamon raisin babka was by far the best thing. I'm very glad I went with that one instead of the chocolate. It's buttery with just the right amount of cinnamon and raisins. It's my favorite babka I've ever had. My husband downed his slice when he tried it. The only annoying thing was I didn't just get the chocolate on to try too. Next time I'm back in the city, I'm picking up some extra loves."
2688,HSW4iLqHCBNRttXC1IemaQ,5/28/2022,5 star rating,Breads Bakery Upper West Side is always busy. I was so glad they opened on the Upper East Side because I enjoyed their Babka and the Boureka especially spinach feta. When I'm visiting this West Side neighborhood I stop in for Boureka to go or sit outside to eat and run. Holiday weekends are a good time to buy the Chocolate Babka to share with my daughter. It's the best Babka I can recommend. If you are in the neighborhood I recommend you visit. There's so many selections you can spend a fortune.
2689,HSW4iLqHCBNRttXC1IemaQ,10/21/2022,5 star rating,The pastries and cookies here are very good! Way better than your commercial options like Starbucks...they are actually fresh. A good option in the neighborhood if you are near Lincoln Center. What they call a cinnamon roll is hard to describe (not what I pictured) but really tasty and something different. I would definitely get it again. The cookies were fresh and soft as well!

Fruit tart is also nice, a little different from what you may expect as the filling is jam rather than cream. The line moves fast and there are plenty of good options with flaky dough, especially savory ones, but I would like to see an apple/fruit turnover or something like that."
2691,HSW4iLqHCBNRttXC1IemaQ,7/25/2022,5 star rating,I highly recommend the egg breakfast sandwich which I grabbed before going to the NYAFF.  Perfect snack before the show.  The sandwich was a sliced hardboiled egg with cucumbers and tomatoes on a brioche type roll.  The breads all looked amazing.  I will have to get a babka in the near future.  I asked for a black iced coffee.  I was given a cup with room for milk and asked for it to be filled to top.  The staff who handed me the coffee was more than happy to oblige.  Thanks!

I was really pleased because there was actually a doorman making sure there were only a certain amount of guests inside at once. Once we were able to enter, it was fun being inside! There are so many different rolls, loaves, cookies, and other assorted pastries to look at. We decided to pig out a bit... My bf got a Swiss Muesli Roll and a croissant. He really enjoyed the flavors and heartiness of the Swiss Muesli Roll. His croissant was flaky and just perfect. I got a cinnamon roll and a spinach bureka. Both were delicious! Our coffees were the perfect mix of bitter but sweet. We loved taking them with us as we walked to the American Museum of Natural History. We also decided to purchase a flourless brownie cake for later. We did ourselves a disservice waiting to eat that a couple of days later. Even days later... it was still pretty amazing! The chocolate flavor was to die for! And the cake was pretty moist. It melted in your mouth, it was so wonderful! I really loved Breads Bakery. There was a guy at the counter who was really polite and friendly. He was clearly working very hard to get people ushered into the line, take their orders, and get them on their way. I appreciated his kindness while hastening us through. I would totally revisit if I had the opportunity. 9/10 recommend"

My friend moved from the Bronx to the south years ago and she always told me how much she misses the wonderful cakes, cookies, etc from the bakeries around Arthur Ave. So, as a surprise I sent her some assorted pastries from Artuso. She was SO happy!! When she called me to thank me I could barely understand her. She kept eating the cookies! Lol Great Place!"
2700,ygVuNvg85cQr4eICVVOy0w,1/17/2020,5 star rating,Before I leave any truly negative reviews I try and contact the business first. We bought pastries to take home and although the store was basically empty except for my family and two other customers our box somehow ended up getting switched. We got home excited to enjoy our pastries only to find someone else's order. Since it was pretty late at this point I sent a message via Facebook. I really wasn't anticipating a response but I was definitely pissed and wanted to let them  know. I can't tell you how completely shocked I was to get a call from Mr. Artuso himself. We happened to be about fifteen minutes away when I got the call we decided to stop in. Mr. Artuso apologized and told us to choose whatever we wanted. We only wanted to replace what we didn't get our first visit and that's all we chose. All of our pastries were amazingly fresh and delicious. I can absolutely see why this bakery has been in business for so long. I am still beyond impressed with this level of customer service. I will absolutely be back when I'm in the area again.

The coleslaw was perfectly seasoned, creamy, not dry but not soupy either.  The cornbread was good, more on the sweet side which is how I like it.  I like even how they present the food nicely, not too pretentious but more than just slapping it on the plate.Definitely will be coming back here and recommending to others!"
2706,CI9RYUjDdYS7GXL08tI9Cw,3/1/2021,5 star rating,"As a person who eats halal, I am so incredibly happy this place exists! I honestly thought I hated burgers because I've been stuck eating so many crappy Impossible burgers until I tried the Juicy Lucy. The name says it all. It's incredibly juicy and delicious. It's stuffed with a bunch of cheese and is everything a burger should be. But their chili cheese fries? Now that's something I would happily devote my annual income to. First off, the portion is huge. Could be an entrée on its own. Its layered with this amazing spicy chili, fries, jalapenos and actual cheese! Not the goopy cheese sauce that tastes artificial. Every fry has chili and cheese. The fries are thick and can handle the weight of all the toppings.I used to be obsessed with their Amarillo House burger with the creamy mushroom sauce. I ordered it a couple times and the most recent order kinda let me down. The sauce was more watery and lacked flavor. Mushrooms weren't seasoned. They also used to give huge onion rings but now its one of the tiny frozen ones. I tried their garlic parmesan wings and the sauce was very similar to the mushroom one. Because it was on the liquid side, it made the wings soggy. I would try another flavor because the chicken was great!They also have a special going on right now where you get a free bubble tea if you spend $25 I think. The brown sugar one was delicious and sweet but it did have weird boba. It was light brown and very floury. I don't think I'd buy it but it was a nice freebie! Also they charge a 10% fee on top of your bill due to COVID. They state it clearly on the menu but be on the lookout for that. The owner was the only one working in the front and did a great job handling all the groups!"

2708,CI9RYUjDdYS7GXL08tI9Cw,6/27/2019,4 star rating,"Addy's BBQ is comfort-food casual place to grab a bite in Astoria.The service is very friendly, the food is ok to great! and the ambience is very casual.K and I met a friend for dinner here. We had the following.House made pineapple, ginger beer and raspberry lime drinks. The best drink was the tart sweet refreshing raspberry lime. The drinks were very cool and refreshing in the high summer humidity. I'm a big fan of house made sodas and drinks. Esp when the drink is better than something you could buy at the store (Addy's raspberry lime or Katz's iced tea). The Juicy Lucy- a juicy hamburger with a melted core of cheese.The Juicy Lucy concept originated in Minneapolis. This version was perfect! The cheese was hot and oozing. The waiter informed us that the burger would be cooked medium well and my friend agreed. Then the burger served a perfect juicy medium rare. The warm cheese core, the messy toppings, the cheese on top, all the pickles, lettuce, fried onions: it made a perfect burger.It was also served deconstructed on a long platter, so you could add whatever toppings you want. Or add all the toppings to make a great stacked burger! Cajun wings- these wings had the right texture! The wings were crispy and tossed in a savory very mildly spicy sauce. I wanted a more spicy sauce but I think that's what the atomic wings are for.Beef short ribs- The beef ribs arrived with fried onions and corn bread. The beef short ribs were so soft and gelatinous and arrived boneless. This was nice. The texture was melt-in-your-mouth. The molasses-based sauce was very sweet. It was as sweet as the mango lassi. If you like your meats sweet, then order this.Mac and cheese- this was savory cheesy and very hearty. It was a solid comfort food dish. Garlic wings- the wings were large and very saucy. I liked the parmesan on top. The wings were a little less crispy than the cajun wings but that could be due to us taking pictures of the other food first. Cajun burger- the burger came deconstructed on a plate. The patty is in mini plate with lots of sauce. One half of the bun is topped with fried onions. The other half is topped with lettuce, tomato and pickles. I loved the sweet mildly spicy sauce. I just wish that the burger was less dry.Mango and strawberry lassi- the Mango lassi was sweet, thick, creamy and refreshing. It is all I want in this sticky summer weather.Strawberry lassi was a lighter version of the Mango. It tasted like a strawberry smoothie. Still great in the heat.SERVICEService was very kind and attentive. But the waiter and waitress seemed confused or inexperienced. No cups and no silverware at the table. We had to ask for it. We ordered from the menu both the appetizers and the entrees. We weren't asked if the food should come separately. I assumed incorrectly that they would be spaced out (due to small tables and surface area). The apps and entrees came out at the same time. Oh no!We were accidentally served someone else's wings. They were really trying and very sweet. The waiter and waitress came to check on us multiple times. I appreciated the effort!I would return for the Juicy Lucy and the Mango Lassi!"
2709,CI9RYUjDdYS7GXL08tI9Cw,9/12/2020,3 star rating,"Decided to check this place out cause I wanted a burger and chili cheese fries. Since its covid, there is outdoor seating, which didnt really make a difference as we would look inside and the workers barely wore their masks (dropped it to their chin). Our server was sweet, but we did have to ask for the same stuff a couple times as she would not bring it for us. Oh, and when she brought water and other things...she didn't wear her mask. I got the basic 1/4 pounder burger. Not bad. The reason I give this place 3 stars.The chili cheese fries...not your basic. It was spicy (doesn't say that on the menu) and has a hint of middle eastern or so. Tasted like curry cheese fries.Probably won't be coming back.Oh, and they automatically charge 15% gratuity."

I really do enjoy pretty much everything I've tried there from the steak to the wings, everything is lovely. One thing I don't recommend is the juicy Lucy burger, there was a problem with the meat being straight up raw in the middle. It says it will come medium but it was more rare than medium, very hard to eat straight up raw meat so definitely don't order that, we couldn't eat it at all. But I do recommend the atomic wings, chicken burgers, steak, Mac and cheese and anything else."

The food here is delicious and the portion size is huge! An appetizer and one main dish would be enough to fill two people. We ordered wings and two main dishes and took most of it home! We got: - Mango lassi - Very good and has whipped cream on top. Not overly sweet.- Garlic wing - Delicious! Non-spicy option with a creamy garlic sauce. I think the sauce has parmesan cheese. Comes with about 10 wings/drumsticks.- Mixed mishkaki - Came out sizzling! It has onions, grilled chicken and beef, and comes with rice. Very large portions! Decent, but my friend preferred the short ribs. The rice was very good and comes with some slaw and mixed vegetable salad which gives a slightly spicy kick!- Beef short ribs - Very tender with BBQ sauce. Comes with grilled onions and cornbread. I'm not a fan of BBQ sauce but my friend loved it.The service was ok, they refilled our water but it would have been nice if they filled our takeout containers for us instead of handing us the containers and bags. A 15% tip is automatically added to the bill."

The food here is good and halal too.  Not the best steak place in town but because they offer halal, it makes it a contender in my book. Food: We had tbone steak, short ribs, wings, cheese fries, country fried chicken and chicken/beef mishkaki. This place is known for the mishkaki and it comes out in sizzling hot plates. It's a nice show when they come out. The chicken mishkaki is tender but the beef is a bit tough. The short ribs is juicy and soft like butter. Melts in your mouth. The t-bone steak was juicy and made perfectly with delicious mashed potatoes. Though I did not care for the gravy. Drinks: They have a bunch of specialty smoothies and we got mango lassi and mango pina colada. Really good. Though I typically like my mango lassi with maraschino cherry. Service: they were polite and helped us. They can accommodate large parties. I hated the fact that they are missing items on menu. We tried to order a few steak options and they did not have. Price is affordable."

I ordered the food over the phone and had to tell the person my order multiple times and despite that when i went to pick up my order items were missing. When i told them that the waiter told us to order again and wait half an hour instead of apologizing he just walked away without hearing us out. We decided to not order again and left. When i opened my food the amarillo burger had chicken tenders for a patty and barely any of those too. There was no cheese and no tomato and they didnt put any utensils not even napkins in the bag.

They gave me a glass of water while I waited, a nice, simple gesture. You get a 10% discount for take out, which is kind of nice. Overall it's a small restaurant with about 8 tables for 2. I really wanted to try the Mala Spicy noodles but being it has 2 peppers for spiciness I tried the Kimchi noodles with only 1 pepper. I did not find it spicy at all so I'll get to try Mala next time! For to-go orders everything comes in a compact container. You dump the noodles in the broth. I was definitely satisfied from the portion and overall enjoyed it.

Kinda wish it was prepared a bit closer to my pickup time so it would have been a tad warmer.I got R9 (scallion and mushroom noodles) as well as S5 (dumplings in chili oil). I liked the light and savory flavor of the noodles, though the texture was just OK (to be fair, I brought it home - so it was nice that it wasn't soggy or sticky after sitting for awhile). I also liked the slight mala kick from the chili oil of the dumplings. As for the cost, I found it to be a bit steep for the dumplings, which are now $9 for 6pc (the noodles on their own are already $13). It's a decent amount of food - I got two meals out of it - but I'm also a small person.The location is great, just across the street from the 1 station. Pretty convenient to get your groceries at Trader Joe's and then hop over to Simply Noodles for dinner."

The food was all really good. We tried the dumplings in chili oil- my favorite, Dan Dan noodles, different from what I have eaten before but very good. We had very credible soup dumplings and a bargain scallion pancake.  A very nice place to carbohydrate load with nice staff."
2721,GN4-wXUXgfuMO4KHa76J5w,10/18/2022,3 star rating,"Average noodle takeout. In my noodle soup, the round noodles had a forgettable texture and taste, and the broth is flat as well. The hodgepodge of toppings didn't help: corn, wood ears, and ::shudder:: a leaf of iceberg lettuce. That uncut lettuce was like a sad, wilted membrane that inhibited my enjoyment of the other components. Service is nice, however."

My bf went recently and was raving about it, so we decided to go for an early dinner tonight.We shared an order of Pork Buns ($9+), which comes with 2 pork buns. It was good, but considering how filling the noodles were, we didn't really need an appetizer.For noodles, their specialty is the rice noodles. I chose the Miso Ramen ($15+), though, which was really good. I would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a good miso ramen in the neighborhood. The broth was delicious--not too strong, not too mild. The noodles were plentiful with a ton of toppings, including chashu (pork), soft boiled egg, fish cakes, seaweed, bean sprouts, corn, bamboo shoots, scallions and sesame. Very tasty and very filling.The staff was very attentive and friendly, too. Will be back again for sure!"
2723,GN4-wXUXgfuMO4KHa76J5w,2/20/2022,5 star rating,"Grabbed an early dinner before attending a show nearby. Just steps from the 72nd Street 1,2, and 3 train station; super convenient location to lots of retail shopping and the Beacon Theatre. Service was great and the menu was simple and satisfying. I was originally going to just order the ramen as it hits the spot on a blustery winter evening. But after talking to our server and listening to his recommendations, I changed my mind and ordered what he suggested. The classic and signature beef noodles with a cloudy white broth. It was simple in taste and full of ingredients - ramen style egg, wood ear, fried tofu and corn. The bowls are heated to 100 degrees so it's super hot to handle, hence it comes on top of a bowl holder. We joked that it looked like a pot planter or a pets water bowl but it works. Keeps the noodles and broth warm throughout my meal. He also suggested the vegetarian Duck Buns. Very good, smoky and tender but with the same texture of real protein, it was a nice change to actually eating meat. Enjoyed it very much.Hubby ordered the spicy ramen with extra noodles and it didn't disappoint. This place was a no frills, simple and clean, noodle spot. Totally a good value and while small, it's worth the wait if you can't get seated right away. Turnaround time is good."

I had the Mala spicy rice noodles, and it was so so good. I had never had szechuan soup based noodles before, but this was an amazing first experience with it. I am officially a fan, and I will definitely be back for more."

The baklava is okay though. If you stop by this location, try stuff other than the baklava. Try the Turkish ice cream (which has creamy semi chewy  texture) and their puddings."
2726,FcQA5tV8wlz6jg_UK_s7Hw,8/31/2020,4 star rating,We ordered 2 of each of the baklava they had. Overall they were great but a little too sweet for other ones we have had in the past.

I just asked the friendly staff for a mixture (about 6 pieces big and small) which only costed a little less than $10.

Pistachio seems to be their most popular flavor and that is what I had. I found the baklava to be very soft, very moist and sweet. It was definitely some of the best I have ever had! You can buy them by the piece or order it in bulk as well. They also offer kadayif (a shredded wheat dessert) and dilimi (similar to baklava but shaped like a slice of pie)."

The bar was very busy with happy people. Looked like fun! Our drinks were amazing. Seasonal and delicious. As always the food was exceptional. My favorite Duck confit with tender duck meat. Everyone else ordered the steak frites. Desserts are to die for! I was so excited for the meal that I only photographed desserts. Enjoy this iconic restaurant. Wonderful atmosphere and food!

Our service was communicative with us from the moment we were seated, making sure to ask what time the show was so he can make sure we were served in an appropriate amount of time. My friends and I shared the Buffalo chicken dumplings and salmon tartare to start, both of which were perfect for sharing with great flavor. For my entree I had a special which was linguine and clams and it was the perfect serving size and hit the spot. My friends had the steak frites (incredibly flavorful), salmon entree, and lobster roll. We also ordered a side of fries to share and it was more than enough for 3-4 people with an assortment of dipping sauces. The drinks were fantastic as well."

I think it might have been the name - at first glance I thought they served Luxembourgish food but quickly learned they were a French restaurant. Regardless of my initial confusion, the pics looked great as did the menu, so I made it my intention to eventually check it out. That opportunity finally came when I was making dinner plans to celebrate my birthday - this seemed like an ideal spot, so I made a reservation and off we went.  CL is located among a number of residential buildings on the UWS. The view from the street is partially obstructed due to their outdoor dining area, but they have a bright red awning so you really can't miss it. I made reservations for indoor dining, but I got a view of the outdoor dining area before going in and it's quite nice. I also noticed another outdoor area with chairs and small tables which I learned is a lounge area for drinks or if you're waiting for your table. After verifying our vaccination credentials, we were led inside. The interior isn't too large but definitely bigger than a typical Manhattan restaurant. The bright color scheme gives it an open feel with splashes of red that enhanced the character. The space had an upscale casual feel - like if I had to make an analogy to fashion, I would say CL is ""smart casual"". The menu is really all over the place, but I say that in a good way because there seems to be something for a variety of tastes. There's definitely French overtones but there's also a number of New American dishes as well. Since it was a special occasion, I had a drink. It was really cold out so I thought a spiced toddy would warm me up - indeed it did, and it was quite good at that. I also had a Manhattan which was good as well. I decided to start with the French Onion Soup - I hadn't had a French Onion in a long time and this one did not disappoint; it had just the right amount of cheese and good flavor without being too sharp or overpowering. The salmon looked really good, so I decided to get that as my main. The fish was cooked really well, and was paired with sunchokes that added a nice carb-like texture. The braised salsify and the leek cream were also great complements to the dish. For dessert, I got the cornflake chocolate chip sea salt cookies. The cornflakes gave an interesting texture, and the cookies were super super crispy which is just how I like them.  Service was awesome - from check-in at the front door to the time we were getting up to leave, I had wonderful interactions with the entire staff. Overall, I had a great experience at Cafe Luxembourg - with all they have to offer in food and service, I would definitely return for another meal."

25,u5gLdI6l6zsPxL2kOYbyfw,12/7/2022,2 star rating,"Wow - talk about an unwelcoming place.  I realize this establishment caters to the theater crowd and turning tables is a priority for them, but when we got there it seemed there was a major effort to get things moving along quickly so we would leave - it wasn't close to the show starting hours, to the contrary, we were early, so I think they wanted us out so they could get another seating in before the shows began.Host takes our party of 4 to a booth, it was still dirty so while the four of us stood there, he took a rag and cleaned the top, put down some new plates and silverware and had us sit down (one in our party was sliding over on the crumbs this host had just wiped off the table).  Turns out the booths were extremely tight for 4 people, and you would have thought I was asking for the Moon when I requested a different table.  Got lots of excuses (the table is going to be the same size), just move us, OK?  Let's pretend for a second that I'm going to drop about $250-$300 in your restaurant in the next hour and maybe you can show a little customer appreciation?Service was friendly, prompt and good.  However a lot of hovering and attempts to remove plates (some of us weren't finished yet) - I may be wrong but I took this as an attempt to get us done and out instead of just trying to remove empty plates from the table.  The only reason this place didn't get a 1-star review is the food was pretty good.  We had appetizers, salads, entrees, etc., all good.  Kudos to the kitchen.So your experience may differ, but all I can summarize with is if  you're seeking OK food and a lot of ""I really don't care about you"" vibes, all while you're dropping close to $100 per person......give 'em a try."

37,1HBtCnBGBYoq3zaQUxTbmg,10/23/2017,5 star rating,"Sushi Gama serves excellent mid-quality sushi for the great price point in the UES. Sushi in New York comes in three tiers: low, mid and high quality. The low quality is usually something you find at a AYCE sushi place. High quality sushi usually comes at a high price (think of Sushi Zo). Sushi Gama has mid quality for a great mid-level price. ($60 for 12 piece Omakase). The cuts of fish were delicious and smooth but not perfection. Our first bite of sushi (and one of my favorites) was the fatty seared o-toro. It was meaty, rich and had my salivating for more. Usually, this is served at the end of the meal because it is so rich. But it was the first bite, which threw off the palate for the leaner cuts of fish that followed. I enjoyed the complimentary fatty salmon, lean tuna and mango salad that was served in the beginning of the meal. The clam salad was very nice with the Chayote salad but the clams were missing a springiness that is associated with freshness. The California Barbara uni was almost perfect: sweet, salty, tender but a little cold. The wild king salmon was amazingly tender, sweet and slightly fatty. The eel was perfectly savory, fluffy, and cloud-like, it was amazing! So the cons: one scale on the fish at the end of the meal. Sauces and wasabi was a little strong. The sushi omakase could be rearranged so the O-toro piece is served at the end after the uni. Pros: Most pieces were very good to amazing. And the Chef was very very friendly. I will definitely return for a great priced meal!"

This one staff member named Kim was extremely rude and disrespectful and got angry with us for having to walk in the rain.  They/she/he was constantly walking by us while we were eating and quite frankly made us very uncomfortable.  We asked for the check, we were suprised  to see what our subtotal was. While looking at the bill  we saw the waitress had tipped herself\himself\themself by $17. When we asked them to take the tip  off and we will  tip them  in cash they said no and went on a rant. About how nobody in NYC leaves her tips and that we will never come back again if we don't tip her. I then mentioned That we were going to tip her but decided not to because of how disrespectful she was being and asked for her name. She then yelled saying ""are you gonna put this on yelp are you gonna complain about me.""We paid without the tip and immediately left and we will not be returning.

The service was nice, and the food came out quickly. We ordered the organic roasted chicken, truffle fries, seafood risotto, and burrata. Everything was delicious. The creamed spinach with the chicken was especially tasty, and we also loved the scallops in the risotto. I also appreciate that we were surprised by such a cute anniversary dessert (the ""Happy Anniversary"" was edible chocolate!). The live music was fantastic, and even the music they played when the band took a break was great too. I'm glad we got such a good view/experience for dinner. I would def recommend!"

We had a time limit on table so alerted hostess and she said it was ok. When food finally arrived everything was luke warm. Nothing hot. We didn't even order that much. 3 people split a NY strip and lobster ravioli with side of mashed potatoes. And 2 adults / 1 child split chicken and scallops with a side of carrots. Food was really good but disappointed in that it took so long and wasn't even hot to enjoy but was starving so we ate it. Bottle of wine that was ordered, delivered to table, was not presented, just opened and poured and looked at the bottle after the pour and noticed that was not what we had ordered. The wine that was brought was a cheaper wine (in stores) but wasn't on the menu that was sold as a bottle - no price listed - managed to be added on to the bill for same price as bottle was ordered so not sure if they just wrote it in and priced it. The wine was fine but server etiquette is to show the bottle of wine before opening to avoid a mistake like this."

It's very New York style with jazz live music everyday and you don't have to buy ticket to get in. We came in for a drink only so we sat on the bar you do not need a reservation for that, but if you prefer to dine in reservation is highly recommended. There are massive selection of whisky and some craft cocktails not just whisky cocktails. I ordered couple of the cocktails from the menu they are all really good. But if you have any particular whisky you want, you probably can find it here. The bar seats are first come first serve, but they also have some stools around the whole area you can sit as well. The drinks are little pricy but the place is very classic and good vibe. The jazz performance is excellent. Not too loud so you can still hear each other talk."

If you are a whisky lover, this is definitely your element. The whisky book is about 44 pages front and back. The ambiance is amazing. It's both great for groups and date night. Live Jazz is also part of your dining experience. They do offer outdoor dining and booths seems they have AC. Inside It's a chic cozy decor and feel. Staff very engaging and friendly. As my group are foodies as myself we pretty much ordered almost most of the menu.Drinks were very spirit forward and tasty. Appetizers were delicious.  Main courses were good. My only issue was my meal was too salty but I loved the fact I was able to swap out for something else. Issues like that is a big plus when a restaurant does right by its patron.Dessert was an experience the Fine and Rare Sphere is a definite must.I can go on and on but from the oysters, charcuterie boards, scallops, octopus, steak, lamb, sea bass you will not be dissatisfied.  It's an experience you need to add to your list."

We made a reservation and I would definitely recommend one because it was very busy and it's a pretty small venue. It's a narrow but long restaurant. We were a pretty big group of 6 people and despite our reservation we were initially seated at a 4 person table. It took a lot of convincing the hostess to move us to a larger table. We ultimately were moved after ordering 4 dozen oysters that didn't fit on our table. We picked bar belly for the $1 oyster happy hour and the oysters were amazing. Fresh and sizeable. We ordered 3 rounds of 4 dozen and it took about 20 minutes between each round to have the oysters shucked. The oysters were definitely the highlight of the night. The fries were also very good and had seafood seasoning that made them addictive and we ordered 3 rounds. The happy hour drink selection was basic and we opted to get their signature cocktails. Our group ended up trying at least one of each and they were all delicious. Burnt love, dead witch, invisible woman, knight rider were crowd favorites. I did order a mango #5 but something in it had a spoiled flavor I didn't like and the waiter was nice enough to switch it out for a different cocktail. We ordered the deviled eggs which were delicious and hit the spot when we started to get hungry. The charcuterie board was pretty standard and on the smaller side. Overall, you'll definitely see me back there for oysters."

My friends and I arrived for HH at 5pm and it got crowded within 30 minutes. Tip: try to have your group arrive all at once because there's literally no room to expand once it gets busy. I know $1 HH oysters is a great deal but it would've been better if the oysters weren't so sandy. The belly fries were more enjoyable since they were seasoned well and had just enough crisp. As for the drinks, I personally enjoyed the Moscow Mule (contains ginger) even though it was not that strong. The Jackalope Spritz is good if you like sweet and bubbly drinks. The Old Fashioned is good if you enjoy the taste of pure alcohol, specifically bourbon. Overall a decent spot to enjoy a few drinks and snacks, and hang out. Bonus: Bar Belly surprised us with some live jazz towards the end of HH if that's up your alley!"

The atmosphere was dark-ish with candles and nice decor; this would be a good date spot if you're looking for one in the area. The only thing I'd say is that the tables were a little too small; for a group of four it felt like we were going to knock something off the table if we moved too much.

Go KIOSK.  Tip 3) your chances of ever coming back will be low anyway - so why bother.  When would this food ever be worth this experience? They have people taking orders that don't say anything (staring at me for 3 seconds i had to ask if *they* were ready to take my order.  And you guessed it, she botched the order (did not repeat my order back to me).  Makes sense - put people at the registers who don't like to speak.  Perfectly fine human being, bad management.  Waited for 20 minutes, did not hear my number, nor was it anywhere on the computer screen which displays orders.  But apparently it had been back there the whole time.  The (assistant manager?) basically gave me some serious hand wave and fast walkaway saying she called my number ""twice"".  I asked for a fresh meal which she finally did provide.  So, I am guilty of going to McDonalds - that is what i felt like just being there.  awesome.  At least they didn't charge me for the side of Sass.  BTW, ive been plenty of 'super ghetto' mcd's - Central Harlem, Brownsville, Bronx and plenty of other cities.  Nothing was ever this bad as far as the quality of the employees.  This is the worst MCD I've experienced in NYC, although admittedly i would never step foot in one after 7pm FWIW. If this were my company id just NUKE this entire effing franchisee.  Its far too small a location (unruly customers plus a cattle auction atmosphere) and too many employees dont want to be there, a manager that clearly cant keep this place together.  Bring in / rotate a team from other locations.  This location totally ruins the corporate brand.  Ive never wished for robots as much as i did today.  However catch 22 - im pretty certain an AI bot visiting this location will ponder the need for our existence as a species.  Thanks McDonalds - you have also made me frightened for singularity."

Amazing they are ripping people off because lots of people don't look at the receipt and I would not have known if I started straight at the register.

It seemed that he just wanted to get rid of me and my students - paying customers - rather than assure that our order was filled correctly. I suggested that we receive our items, and then step outside to disperse them to my students, and double check the receipt to confirm we received all items - all of this so that our large group would be out of the way in the already busy restaurant.  He continuously told us that if we left the restaurant with our food items that the location would not be liable for any missing items. We then moved to check off the items at the counter, and the manager rushed through this process. When I questioned his certainty on us receiving all of the food, he became snippy and flippant, rather than meeting my concerns with positive customer service. Another wonderful employee, BRITTANY, saw the issue and poor process happening and proceeded to disperse our food to the students one-by-one - a much more efficient method that I would have expected the manager to lead. During this we discovered MANY ITEMS WERE MISSING, and she simply called to the crew staff to make sure we got them. All the while, the manager watched over her shoulder, commenting on the missing items as if my students and I intended to steal food that we had already paid $200 for. This experience was a nightmare and not at all the level of customer service I expect in retail. I understand that large orders and groups are daunting, but those occasions should be met with HIGHETENED kindness and efficiency, not an attitude or sloppy, inefficient processes. When we left the store, we realized that after all of the above we STILL DID NOT RECEIVE ALL OF THE ITEMS. I was so frustrated with the experience that I did not even bother to return to get them - it honestly was not worth the headache at that point. PLEASE BEWARE ordering here. The store is always busy, and the leadership does not seem to have a handle on quality customer service approaches.THANK YOU BRITTANY for your superior customer service and improvisation in a hectic moment. NO THANK YOU, MANAGER."

I don't even wanna give you damn one star because of the customer service at this Mcdonald's. I and my sister walked in and a cashier, a woman and named MADJINA, seems to be rude to other customers. Well, thank you for the whole Damn service with your stupid, and ugly expressions. But you know what? If you earn money from the other people, you can't act like that. You should treat people as ""CUSTOMER"" not as your ""FRIEND"". If you're a cashier, remember you are the store's face which means, the one who meet the customer for the first time when they walk in the store. I ruined all good feeling from the whole day because of this woman. I'm sure I will never revisit this damn store as long as she's working there."

I ordered chicken tenders, fries, and a cheeseburger. The tenders looked like they have been stuck at the bottom of the freezer for years and decided to cook them. The fries were stale and dark, and the burger wasn't good either. My girlfriend was also disappointed with her Big Mac and fries. Never again will I go there again.

We were seated in the covered patio area and served by a pleasant woman.I wasn't that hungry so I just ordered fried shrimp and a Henny Colada which was delicious.My fried shrimp came with tartar sauce but I wanted cocktail sauce which took two requests to finally get.The others I was dining with ordered ginormous sticky chicken wings and salmon. They appeared to be happy with their food but mine was just okay. The shrimp were not overly fried and had a nice golden crust. They were a medium size shrimp which was cool so I was satisfied.

This is actually one of the worse locations when it comes to the Dallas BQQ franchise for a number of reasons. They are a little disorganized when it comes to getting you seated and it seems like everyone isn't on the same page when it comes down to it. That's not the kicker though. During Covid, they were literally sitting some of us out in the open with ABSOLUTELY no screen protection. Our waitress even asked ""did they really sit you here? "". Legit! If your waitress sees the problem then it definitely should be seen as a problem to management. I have included a screen shot from a video I took. Insane. I ordered my drink and fries all the while not feeling the most comfortable for obvious reasons. The drinks, as always, are the stars of the show. Very good. However, the fries were pretty unusual. Not fresh, unseasoned and I felt like I was transported to the Stone Age, having to hunt for my ketchup just to remotely enjoy them. At this point, we just left as it was too uncomfortable and I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything. The environment was as lackluster as their menu. Not the best food here to be honest. I've had much better experiences at the Times Square location and Flatbush locations! The village is also decent. This location is sub par putting it kindly. I'm sorry to say."

I love and used to eat mostly their ribs and usually get the same thing every visit. However since I stopped eating pork over the pandemic I ordered just chicken.My chicken and rice was just OK because my azz was tempting to get those ribs that I saw on other customers tables, LOL.  They're most famous for their delicious frozen and liquored down drinks.  Be careful because those sweet drinks will kick in and have you feeling tipsy on your way out. Food is affordable and I've never been disappointed with the exception of having too wait because it's crowdedI've been at this location a few times and the staff were cool. I like that you're not on to of each other like other locations.

Frozen Hennessy Coladas all around. It was chilled alright, Hennessy infused with a little extra in a tube to top them off, then finished with a cherry on top.I must say it's been ages since I've been to a Dallas BBQ chain so it was fun to try it again and to see how the menu has changed. It is definitely more streamlined now and has a good variety besides their signature Fried chicken. Of all the entrees we had, the star was the roasted chicken and ribs, and the choice of sauces. My fried chicken and waffles were the other favorite. The chicken was sticky with a nice honey glaze.  And the waffle had cheese and scallions inside! Whoa, I was pleasantly surprised by the first bite. Cheese gave the waffle more texture and a hint of salt to an otherwise buttery and fluffy bite. The scallions worked to give it color and complimented the cheese.The reason why the star count was rounded down was because the other two entrees were disappointing. My friend ordered steak and fried shrimp, it looked better then it tasted. And my other friend's chicken was dry. Even the sauce couldn't save it. So the food was inconsistent."

Their honey sauced chicken has been a thing that dreams are made of for me, for many years. I used to visit the Time Square location and I was never disappointed. But this location has turned dreams into nightmares. The chicken in all of our meals was very dry and lacked any type of flavor. The only saving grace was the honey sauce. It was really good. The sticky wings were also hard and dry. Again, only saving grace there was the sauce.  The tempura veggies were extremely plentiful but all stuck together. One big lump of veggies to be torn apart and lose their coating.  The cornbread was literally little bags of hard squares. And by hard, I mean HARD! Last but not least was the yellow rice.  Which is usually fresh and tasty. It was dry and tasteless. Although it was handed out in a large serving, it was a waste.  I want to say I won't eat here again, but the dream of great honey chicken will bring me back. Just probably to another location."

Sandwiched in between other tall buildings, you could be forgiven for missing it if you walked by too quickly.  There is  a waiting area inside but we only waited a few minutes to be seated.Once we sat down, it was kind of like visiting an old friend.  The dark wood tables and chairs.  The carpet that looked like some odd, dark color that is hard to define.  The odd lighting that creates both dark corners and really bright spots at the same time.  And of course, the paper menu on the table.  This was definitely a BBQs and it felt somehow comforting to my 16 year old self.Our waiter was...very busy.  I got the feeling this person had many more tickets assigned to him than one would normally have.  He always seemed to be dashing from one place to another, and once we had our food, he basically vanished until we were almost done eating.  I don't blame BBQs specifically for this.  I think this is an artifact of the current staffing issues many restaurants are having.  I will say that flagging employees down to help us out was not a problem so I had a good experience overall.So what about the food?  It was a sold ""B"" experience.  I had a quarter chicken with corn bread and of course the Whiskey Wings.  I was happy to see that after all these years the wings are still gigantic and wonderfully crispy.  The chicken was  moist and having some BBQ sauce to dip it into was nice.  All of us kind of made a mess of ourselves with the wings, but we enjoyed the heck out of them!I wouldn't call this a ""go to"" place in BK, but it definitely did the job in a pinch and I would go back."

I asked the person who brought my food for more sticky sauce. Maybe 5-7 mins go by and he doesn't return. Now my lukewarm food is even colder. I had to ask for replacement fries. Took too long for my server to come and ask if I needed anything or if my food was satisfactory. I started putting on my coat and gathering my things before she came and asked if I needed anything.

The quote time is always wrong and they don't even bother telling you. 3) the food!!! It's not the same as the other locations. Food always comes cold to the point of frozen. I bit into a turkey meatball wrap and almost broke my tooth because it was so hard and frozen. We told the manager and they did not care. Sucks sucks sucks!!

Besides the fact the potatoes were very over cooked and  stale, they weren't enough to cater for the amount of people I had on Easter being that I ordered THREE orders of lamb and they said each order of lamb comes with  order of potatoes .The lamb itself was chewy and dry ,no flavor at all and mostly bone so not enough meat for $40 a serving, instead of giving me a tray per each order of lamb , they added a tray of artichokes and peas , did I ask for that ? It's great if that was added on the side of everything else but it wasn't... it seems it was added instead of the potatoes but I planned my catering based on lamb and lemon potatoes .I'm extremely disappointed  as I only have had great experiences here before , but to screw up this badly on a major Greek holiday ,there is no excuse !!!  Maybe they should be more clear on the catering menu"

The octopus at $25 was so good and more than enough for four people to get a good serving. Everything was fresh, came with lemon, and was served with a smile by the charming people that work here. Highly recommend the Cold Appetizer spread, all the different dips served with fresh, hot pita bread. Happy to come back anytime!PS, we ordered the fried smelt just to try it and it was as good as smelt could ever be, but  nothing super flavorful or crazy good. I wouldn't get it again!"

They started the meal with complementary bread with tapenade, which was really good. Then we ordered the main meal, where I got the chicken souvlaki platter. The chicken was extremely dry, it didn't slide out, so I had to cut the chicken off the stick. The plate gave with tzatziki, but so little for such dry chicken. The pita was good. The feta in the salad was not good, and the fries felt cold and were salt less. Overall, not impressed with the main meal. What was nice is that they gave us complementary halwa, which was good tasting, not to sweet! The price was very reasonable for everything that we got, (I think I paid about $25 with tip). I do not think I will come back again, even given the prices Bc Astoria has other amazing Greek food."

We ordered the taramosalata, Greek salad, and brandingtaramosalata- incredible! Had a great flavor that was creamy but not too rich. The fish roe had a great seafood-y flavor that was perfectly salty but not excessively so. This taramosalata was comparable to others I've had in Greece. Greek salad- pretty good. Feta was great but vegetables were not as fresh as ones I've had before (it's almost impossible to get the freshest veggies in NYC restaurants).Branding- deliciously light and flaky and cooked with a simple olive oil/lemon. Might have been a tad in the overcooked side but still enjoyableOverall, would def come back"

I wanted a salad that bad and it wasn't my plan to go outside having left my coat in the office.In the 30 minutes patrons were given a rated R show, girls working bra-less with nipple piercings poking through SG t-shirts, two employees arguing with heavy use of profanity (one significantly louder than the other) threatening to do harm, all while two other employees are trying to keep the two ladies from going at each other.  ALL THIS IN FRONT the lunch crowd.  I questioned where the manager was during all this, because it was loud, but the modest fellow looked almost too scared to get in the middle of the altercation, but when he finally got hold of the loudest one, he merely called her to the back.  My hope was that one or both would be cut loose for the day, NOPE, both ladies returned to the floor.  And I got the milder of the two ladies that had to prepare MY MEAL, she was so distracted, sharing how unprofessional it was working there, etc etc.  UGH!! All that negative energy went into my meal and I'm just not satisfied with it. Corporate, if you are reading this, DO SOMETHING.  There needs to be an overhaul, the current roster isn't going to work.  There needs to be a manager with an Authoritarian disposition and staff who understand that hierarchy, and most of all, Customer Service.  Today was a Shit Show!"

This was after waiting in line for 45 minutes., although there were only 20 customers in front of me. Worst service and food. They also charged me for some other salad with higher price which I had not purchased. When I pointed it out, I had to wait for another 10 minutes to get my refund as the cashier did not know to process it and had to seek help from 2 other people, for whom I was the last priority. Workers there are busy having fun, talking amongst themselves and do not attend to you promptly even at the peak hours. This was my 4th time at the same location during peak hours.

A friend of mine lives near here so we always ate here for the lunch special. Anyway, I haven't been back for maybe a year or two, and recently visited this year. The location moved! It is now on a corner instead. Very green decor. Same waiter!Food is delicious as always. Fresh and hot, with great flavor and presentation. Portions are great. The bento dinner is massive and I couldn't finish it all in one sitting. Really good value so I highly recommend. Overall, the restaurant has a fresh new aesthetic, new location, but same great taste and service. Show them some love and support by either dining in or taking out. They offer indoor dining as well as outdoor seating!! This is my go to sushi place, my one and only gripe is the parking situation! (Not their fault though-- I'm just warning my fellow drivers out there) Bath Beach is terrible for drivers. You've got to have eyes like a hawk to catch parking spots as they get taken up rather quick. Try the side streets or deal with the meters."

Now I'm a person that ALWAYS tips but I tip after receiving my food and decide if my delivery person deserves more tip or the standard. Then to top it off, the food smells rotten. The restaurant then calls me being rude claiming that I've never bought any food from them, how all their food is fresh, which typically it is BUT unfortunately this time it wasn't. I hate to leave a bad review but the unprofessionalism, rudeness and disrespect was beyond!! 0/10, I will never give them my money again!"

158,YX4AGUuhhF62M9TNpJwSpQ,8/21/2022,3 star rating,"3.5 stars - Haven't been to Chikurin in years but I remember their sushi being cheap and worth it for its price point. I stopped by recently for dinner with my boyfriend and classic rolls are still priced at anywhere from $3.75 - $4.95! A steal, really, considering prices these days. Between my boyfriend and I, we ordered 6 rolls, pork gyoza, 2 miso soups, and 2 drinks. Our dinner came out to around $50 including tax and tip. The rolls here are decent and will probably satisfy any sushi cravings, but I wouldn't set expectations too high. Each roll has a really thin layer of rice, & the fillings are good considering the price. Miso soups were really tasty though & the pork gyoza sauce paired well with the dumplings. My only grievances with the dining experience would be that the menus need a bit of cleaning.. there's an unpleasant smell that comes off whenever the pages are flipped. The water also tasted off, so we opted for sodas instead."

They also have a take out side for sandwiches and desserts. This is a good place for parties with picky eaters or those that like basic food. The menu has varied options that should please most. The food came out quickly. Service was friendly.
179,U5hCNNyJmb7f3dmC1HTzSQ,3/2/2023,4 star rating,"2/21/23 I've only come to purchase from their dessert take out counter but service has always been friendly and efficient. I've purchased their 6"" plain NY cheesecake to bring home to Hawaii. The cheesecake keeps well during the 10 hour flight as long as you freeze it the night before and keep it in an insulated bag. This time I also purchased a slice of the brownie explosion cheesecake. This was delicious! I would definitely buy this flavor again.The take out counter take out area is clean. The overall restaurant has a diner type look to it. I will be visiting again for the cheesecake whenever I'm in NYC."
180,bE3BudqaNQsuInFefCTl8A,1/29/2021,5 star rating,My husband and I found this place during the middle of the pandemic when most Starbucks were closed. I'm so glad we did because this is our go to place when it comes to coffee and desserts. The desserts are always fresh. The service is always pleasant and fast. Try The Nest you won't be disappointed. They always make my iced mocha latte perfect!
181,bE3BudqaNQsuInFefCTl8A,6/2/2021,5 star rating,One of the best bakeries in Queens. The pastries and cakes are amazing. Delicious and beautifully made. We usually stop by once a week. If not more.

As I walked in I was fascinating by their cozy interior decoration, fresh flowers smell and warmth welcome from the young girl behind the counter. After telling her what I wanted, if you're seating outside go ahead I will bring it to you. Wow! That's a great customer service!!I sat down and really enjoyed my coffee as well as their delicious apple  pastry. I highly recommend this unique friendly place."
183,bE3BudqaNQsuInFefCTl8A,5/16/2021,5 star rating,Finally. I avoided The Nest Fine Dessert for so long. It is pleasant place. These guys got a marvelous menu too. All of the staff are super courteous - you definitely feel welcome and taken care of. If I am ever in the area again I will really like to come back to The Nest Fine Dessert.
184,bE3BudqaNQsuInFefCTl8A,8/21/2017,5 star rating,"With display cases chock full of every sized dessert, from the dainty Ladyfinger to the robust butter croissants, there is a sweet to meet everyone's palate.What impressed me the most was the charming decour and intimacy of being surrounded in classy quarters with all of the Italian treats. It reminded me of hilidays of years gone by when my family shared hours together around the table, having coffee and talking.As I was late for my quarterly review with my finance guy, (his review to be more specific) I ordered up a Chocolate Scone, a croissant and an Apple Turnover with a black coffee ---with the idea of washing 'em all down.Although an ambitious plan to eat them all, I fell quite short as the richness of the buttery croissant hypnotized my tastebuds and filled the pit of my stomach. Can't wait to return to a hungry or a snacking state of being when I'll be tearing into that white bag that holds the remaining treasures.Sweetest, kindest, mose lovely folks working behind the counter, you all have made me a customer for life."
185,bE3BudqaNQsuInFefCTl8A,2/19/2020,5 star rating,I love this place. I love the smell of their sweets mixed with the scent of coffee when I walk in. It always just makes me sooo hungry lol Their pastries and desserts are delicious. Never had a bad experience with them. And the service.... they are all so sweet and genuinely trying to make sure you are taken care of. Sort of makes me feellike at my mom's house!
186,bE3BudqaNQsuInFefCTl8A,9/23/2019,5 star rating,"Thank you for making our wedding cake! It was good and and it looked great. The good thing about this place is that they make cakes fresh, usually baked the morning of or the day before. Also posting another cake I ordered from them and some photos I took at their shop. In general, they have a very nice sense of aesthetics when it comes to decorating cakes."
187,bE3BudqaNQsuInFefCTl8A,10/9/2018,5 star rating,"This place has come a long way from what it was from when I was a little girl. Perhaps they're under new management now because it used to be a very sad, dead bakery. Flash forward to 2018. They now have a beautiful very COZY interior that makes you feel like you're away from the busy streets of Ridgewood for a minute. The name ""Nest"" fits the place perfectly  From the cozy, home-like ambiance to the tasty beautiful looking pastries and desserts, they're doing it just right.   They offer everything from morning sweets: ie varieties of croissants, danishes, muffins, turnovers, scones and biscuits, to desserts: ie gourmet slices of pie and tarts to a few things in between like spinach and cheese rolls, cookies and brownies. The few whole cakes/pies that they have on hand, look absolutely marvelous, but try not to get mad when the person in front of you snags it before you do since they only carry one of each of these picture perfect desserts. They also have a full coffee bar behind the counter to surely fill your morning caffeine fix. One thing I admire about this bakery is that they're a small establishment and they offer a lot, but not too much. Have you ever walked into a bakery (like Martha's) and took about 20 minutes to order because they offer literally almost every kind of dessert known to man? Lol Nest is not like that. Their display cases and shelves aren't overflooded and overbearing. The key is less is more, and they're nailing that right on the head. Sure, they might not have exactly what you're looking for, but they'll have something similar and if not, something you weren't even expecting that you can't leave without lol. I'd say nest is a gem of a bakery in Ridgewood and trust me, I don't use that word too lightly (cough*half of yelp*cough)."

189,bE3BudqaNQsuInFefCTl8A,3/11/2017,5 star rating,"More of a bakery with desserts than coffee shop but a great place to stop when you are craving something sweet. I have an allergy to the nuts so there were a lot of delicious looking items I could not have so I settled for the cheese paste Ry, chocolate cookie and linzer cookie.For me the cheese pastry and chocolate cookie were good, freshly made but lacking the wow factor I thought they might have. My favorite of the three was the raspberry linzer cookie.  They also have good coffee. Friendly staff that was very helpful with my allergy and when I was indecisive. I will be definitely bringing my but loving family here when they come to visit."
190,PgiqzwIfcV2eruGmNx77lw,4/20/2018,3 star rating,1 Star off because they forgot the can of ginger ale. Only a $1 but for some reason it bugs me when they forget. It seems to happen enough on deliveries to notice. 1 more star because it's just okay Chinese food. Their sweet and sour chicken was really good. Their pork fried rice was just okay. So not the best but not the worst either!
191,PgiqzwIfcV2eruGmNx77lw,6/19/2018,4 star rating,"This place doesn't have a lot of curb appeal but the food is actually pretty good. I do wish they had real fried rice (you know, Pan fried with soy sauce) instead of yellow rice. Very fast service and very affordable."
192,PgiqzwIfcV2eruGmNx77lw,5/30/2019,5 star rating,Good and fast Chinese takeout and nice staff! Definitely going to keep coming back for the Chicken Lo Mein and Crab Rangoons!
193,PgiqzwIfcV2eruGmNx77lw,1/20/2019,2 star rating,"Cheap prices and open on NYE which was great. Expected more with the reviews but the food was meh. I had to add sauce to my chicken & broccoli since it tasted off. The sweet & sour soup we got tasted strange so we threw it away. Only saving grace was some garlic dish we got. Otherwise, waste of an order"
194,PgiqzwIfcV2eruGmNx77lw,9/20/2015,5 star rating,"This place is really good! It's fast and it's cheap. Steamed dumplings and the spicy beef are excellent.Orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken and shrimp in lobster sauce are our regular orders.$7.20 combos are the best value. It's easily 2 meals. It would be painful to try and eat the amount of food they give you here. The egg rolls are pretty good.Delivery guys are friendly and quick. This is my go to Chinese place."
195,PgiqzwIfcV2eruGmNx77lw,10/10/2013,1 star rating,The worst meal that I have had in a long time!   How can you ruin Honey Shrimp with Walnuts?  I wonder how long will it take before my stomach forgives me?They make battered shrimp and douse it with a bit of walnut pieces with four broccoli florets that was incredibly tasteless.   I have to end now because I am about to throw up and my stomach hurts.   I gave one star because I am highly entertained by the immense phallus shaped carrot on the cutting board.
196,PgiqzwIfcV2eruGmNx77lw,2/12/2016,5 star rating,So good! The chicken with mixed vegetables was on point. Decent quality chicken (better than most Chinese places I've had). The large was more than enough for two people. Super fast delivery and really hot.
197,PgiqzwIfcV2eruGmNx77lw,3/22/2017,4 star rating,"So I work near by and am bound by the closest location to eat considering I'm over at 20th street. But they take good care of me and they are pretty good. Not great, just good. This location is not about costumer service, it's your basic quick Chinese takeout spot. The location of the takeout is unattractive so I would refrain from eating at the location and order anything from there as TakeOut."
198,PgiqzwIfcV2eruGmNx77lw,1/29/2017,3 star rating,"They are inconsistent. We tend to order the same things- egg roll, fried chicken dumplings and maybe General Tso and soup. Today we had egg drop soup which was fine, along with disappointing egg rolls and disappointing fried chicken dumplings. Too bad."
199,PgiqzwIfcV2eruGmNx77lw,7/1/2017,3 star rating,"Cheap and cheerful, with very efficient service, it has a long menu of standard Chinese foods which taste ok and are somewhat on the unhealthy side as a result. If you want cheap, fast and large servings it's the place to go."
200,lIXVm16VchbDXOf7v4hxMA,1/8/2023,5 star rating,We had the meat platter and the chicken platter. Everything was delicious. The naan was so fluffy. And the food was perfectly spiced. The space is low-key. I definitely recommend coming here.
201,lIXVm16VchbDXOf7v4hxMA,3/23/2021,5 star rating,"Used to come here for the lunch special when I worked in the area. This place hasn't changed at all! Fantastic little hole in the wall no frills Indian food. There is indoor dining but only three tables and usually packed so I got my meal to go. Chicken biryani, spinach/potato, and chicken tikka masala. Finished my chai too fast :( didn't get a pic. They gave me a lot which will last me the rest of the week! This is just what I portioned out for dinner"
202,lIXVm16VchbDXOf7v4hxMA,8/11/2022,2 star rating,"Really wanted to have tikka masala chicken and naan. Tried their's and can honestly say it was the most flavorless I've had. Food was microwaved and then served. I have never been to a Pakistani place that didn't have good tikka masala or naan. The reason for the 2 stars is that on the other end of the spectrum, the samosa I had was delicious."
203,lIXVm16VchbDXOf7v4hxMA,10/29/2022,5 star rating,I came here post pandemic and it was bustling as ever. Food is authentic and delicious. I highly recommend
204,lIXVm16VchbDXOf7v4hxMA,5/26/2021,1 star rating,I have found this cooked rubber band from lamb curry. I don't know why don't careful specially in pandemic time. All the food trays are open and people walking around and server reaching other food over one food tray That is gross should keep food covered
205,lIXVm16VchbDXOf7v4hxMA,6/8/2020,5 star rating,Y'all. They're open and serving up dank platters. Get in on it and support them.The selection is more limited due to the pandemic but I promise you that everything they have is still as delicious as before.
206,lIXVm16VchbDXOf7v4hxMA,7/19/2021,4 star rating,"Home style Pakistani food - delicious. I didn't get the platters that everyone is taking about. I got the chicken biriyani- so much better than the Indian biriyanis. Spinach potato curry - tasted a bit stale. Lamb curry - very good. Naan - fresh, delicate and delicious. Would have given 5 stars if the food was less oily. Delicious nonetheless. Kababs looked great - will be back. No frills, no decor kinda place."
207,lIXVm16VchbDXOf7v4hxMA,3/15/2020,4 star rating,"I will get right to the point: This place is pretty good and well, cheap!For $10 and change, I got the Meat platter that came with Naan, raita, and a salad. I ordered the Chicken tikka masala with rice and a lamb kebab. There is a water jug in each table along with disposable plastic cups if you want water. Elsewhere, you'll spend $18+ on this item. Definitely my new ""Go to"" spot when I want cheap fast Indian food if you don't mind the buffet style and microwave reheated food! Overall, great taste, fast service, but definitely not your fine dining experience, more of a local takeout or order first, and get your food on a tray and sit anywhere kind of eatery!"
208,lIXVm16VchbDXOf7v4hxMA,1/7/2022,4 star rating,Nihari was chunkier than I've had before and the naan was ok. Delivery was on time and received in decent shape.

210,ip733nbgjaMMazfQ-Ibhgg,4/8/2022,4 star rating,The carbonara was really good! I had to add pepper to taste but was better than more expensive carbonaras in the city I've had. The vibe is really quaint and realistic to a cafe you would find in Italy. Service is fast. We ordered the bruschetta and the bread  is out of this world too bad you don't get bread for the table. Honestly prob the best bread I've had. Only thing is the portions are smaller than what you would usually get in the area cuz little Italy is known for huge portions. Price is good

213,ip733nbgjaMMazfQ-Ibhgg,12/17/2021,3 star rating,"*Cash only place* The food at Fiat was pretty good although nothing mind blowing, they have pretty good serving portions and decent presentation of their plates. The services was a bit hit or miss as we had to flag down the staff a few times even through the place was not very busy (or very big). It sits in a very fun pocket of NYC surrounded by many other small restaurants with open windows and street dining. Please note they are cash only - this is not very well announced other than in a small portion of their ""wall menu"" (at least that was the only place we saw it."
214,ip733nbgjaMMazfQ-Ibhgg,1/6/2022,4 star rating,"The choices were kind of limited, but it's a very cute cafe. It's perfect to catch up with a friend because the ambiance is very chill and quiet. We came here for breakfast/brunch and nothing really struck me, so I just got the tartine(bread) with butter and jam. The only thing is this place only takes cash! It's very poorly indicated and we only found out when we wanted to pay the bill. Overall it's a cute spot, but personally I don't think I would come back."
215,ip733nbgjaMMazfQ-Ibhgg,1/18/2022,4 star rating,"******CASH ONLY******We stopped by this place for a pasta dinner as it was recommended by our friend who had been there before. We were glad that it was open late and we were looking for a place where we didn't need to pay $20+ for one plate of pasta in Little Italy. However, the biggest thing for us was that this place is cash only and although we did not bring cash, there was an ATM in the basement of the place which had a service fee and would definitely recommend bringing enough cash beforehand if you do not want to go down there (trust me, you don't!). As for the food, we ordered fusilli with pesto and yukon gold potatoes, rigatoni bolognese, and a spaghetti carbonara for three people. The portion was actually a lot and we all had to get a to-go box because it was so filling. For the fusilli with pesto, the pesto was flavorful and the yukon gold potatoes were an excellent addition. The rigatoni bolognese was exactly what you would expect and you could really taste the tomatoes throughout. As for the spaghetti carbonara, it had the perfect ratio of meat to cheese to egg which was so delicious, and would definitely recommend this dish. The plates were presentable and tasted as good as they looked.Aside from our cash dilemma, our waiter was super sweet but we waited for a while for our food, our check, and packing all our food before leaving. Otherwise, I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for some pasta and you are in the area and I would definitely come back for its spaghetti carbonara. The atmosphere is also really calm and perfect for sitting down and chatting."
216,ip733nbgjaMMazfQ-Ibhgg,4/2/2021,5 star rating,Super cute diner-esque cafe! Vintage/retro decorations that really bring the place together. Food was pretty good. The pancakes were really fluffy and delicious! Orange juice was freshly squeezed and was so refreshing. The woman who I believe is the owner(?) is the sweetest and kindest! Type of service alone that makes me want to come again.
217,ip733nbgjaMMazfQ-Ibhgg,9/12/2021,4 star rating,Good prices for pasta and food! I got takeout and the portions are pretty big! Pasta is soo good here. Especially the fettuccini Alfredo which I add chicken too. I've also gotten the melon prosciutto here and that was really good as well. My bf got the spaghetti carbonara and the spaghetti has that thick bounce to it.

Our original dinner spot didn't work out, so we spotted an empty table at Fiat and booked it inside. Small, quaint place, probably nicer for calm Wednesday night dinners with a friend than a busy day like Valentine's weekend with several people in your party. I believe the gnocchi was overly salty that day, but could have been a busy night! Sangria was decent as well. Will probably be back to give them another try in 2022 lol"
220,bvuPipiMPe5FURKZh06Zxg,3/27/2022,5 star rating,"Front staff at the spot were very nice and suggested milk tea drinks that were popular such as Thai tea or Earl grey mt.I got their taro root milk tea and the staff said it might be a smoothie texture nd I was ok with it. It turned out very good. 10/10 for real taro flavor.So happy they were still open at 7:45-7:49pm on a sunday evening when they suppose to close at 8pm. The quality was immaculate regardless of their closing soon. I love that! Not sloppy 10/10.Strawberry lychee green tea was great didnt expect the lychee fruit inside but its legit, fun to look forward to eating after finishing the drink."

We noticed they expanded their menu with fruit tea drinks. They even sell banh mi. I got a Mango Matcha Oat Milk Latte and my friend got their Lychee Thai Tea. Unfortunately, we didn't really taste the lychee in the latter but it was still refreshing and a solid tea!"
222,bvuPipiMPe5FURKZh06Zxg,1/31/2023,4 star rating,Ordered strawberry matcha and cold brew bubble tea. Intense green tea flavor and the cold brew was a nice way to have both caffeine and boba. They even offer do it yourself kits for boba. Enjoy
223,bvuPipiMPe5FURKZh06Zxg,10/9/2022,5 star rating,Finally got to stop by their location in Astoria! I got the mango hibiscus tea lemonade with boba and it was sooooo refreshing and good! I did get 25% sweetness and less ice and it was perfect. The bits of mango were good as well. Will def be hitting them up again for more delicious milk tea and teas!

The  person that the front was very patient, and nice enough to offer some her recommendations~Before I left, they said to make sure to shake the drink very well. They REALLY mean shake it! My first sip was almost overwhelmingly sweet, but then after stirring it like crazy, I was able to finally taste the strong oolong flavor perfectly combined with cream and bubbles! But not gonna lie, Thai Tea with signature cream is still my favorite thus far hehe"
225,bvuPipiMPe5FURKZh06Zxg,3/18/2022,4 star rating,"Hard to stand out as a good bubble tea shop these days but Tea & Milk do a lot of things well. This place prides itself on using higher quality ingredients and keeping things simple, hence the name.BLUE MOUNTAIN BLACK TEA 75% One of the better ""basic"" milk teas I've had, but nothing basic here. The tea flavor really comes through and has this nice natural sweetness to it. Doesn't taste too milky or fake or sweet which is an issue at other bubble tea shopsSLOW DRIP VIETNAMESE COFFEE 75%While the Vietnamese coffee flavor itself is very good, I think going for 100% sugar would have been the right choice since the bitterness really built up with consecutive sips and became unpleasant. Coffee jelly was also not the way to go here maybe because the drink was warm and interferes with its texture. Recommend higher sugar and choosing boba. The boba itself is on the gelatinous and small side, not as chewy as elsewhere"
226,bvuPipiMPe5FURKZh06Zxg,10/10/2022,5 star rating,"So the menu itself looked really good and let me tell you this was just what I needed at the time. I haven't drank much the whole day so I was looking for a fruit tea that would be refreshing. The combination of aloe Vera and the passion fruit hibiscus tea(Astoria drink)  was amazing! My girlfriend got the mango matcha latte which was also really good. Overall, the flavors were pretty unique and tasted really good. We're excited to try this place again!"
227,bvuPipiMPe5FURKZh06Zxg,8/22/2022,4 star rating,"For those in Astoria looking for bubble tea, I highly recommend this place! Second time ordering strawberry matcha latte with boba and all I can is delicious!! You can taste the matcha but it's not overpowering. Decided to try the happy drink (strawberry pineapple) with aloe and it was really good! The base of the drink is strawberry hibiscus and had blended pineapple. Remember to mix it before drinking cause the pineapple blend in there is a little thick. The boba is soft and not soggy or mushy. I can really taste the aloe jelly or maybe the aloe jelly chunks were too small (maybe not enough as well). Total for 2 large drinks is around $15 after tax."
228,bvuPipiMPe5FURKZh06Zxg,12/1/2021,5 star rating,"This is a very cute bubble tea store on a quiet street in Astoria. Tea and Milk offers a variety of choices ranging from regular milk teas to fruit teas and then has some signature drinks you won't find anywhere else. I got their signature taro root milk tea, thai tea, and the matcha tea latte. The bubbles were incredibly soft and the drinks were very milky and rich. This store using real taro root to make their taro drinks so they are very fresh. I was also able to substitute with soy milk so you can ask for different substitutions for your dairy needs. Overall, I would highly recommend this bubble tea store if you are in the neighborhood. It may even be better than your typical chain stores. Ambience: 5/5Taste: 5/5Price: 4/5"

Dress up like a casual dress and serving food  who doesn't know what's his job. And refused to talk Uzbek C'mon That's not what I'm paying for I went there because I wanted to feel homeland what a wasted time and money Also restaurant environment is not really nice that you can bring guests. I need to say lagman and bread were okay but shish kebabs which tasted like it was made of the cheapest meat possible and then boiled it was really boiled I have never seen boiled kebabs and I can't call that one Uzbek kebabs. Restaurant has a discrimination for people who's from another City !!! That's bad I felt like giving a business for my country's Restaurant but it ain't worth it  Shame for  Restaurant for keeping a server like HIMThat's how you present your country SHAME I  don't know  how business is still runningWith that service u won't last long.NEVER come back and DON'T recommend!!!!

Service is average. The compote has a distinct cherry flavor but overall light and sweet. The avocado salad is great and so it the feta and tomatoes accompanied by some warm fresh bread. They were out of hummus which sucks but I guess there's always next time. Hubby wasn't crazy about the plove when he tried it as takeout once before so it took some convincing to get him in the door. As for the kebabs they are good tried one of each of the following : hearts, chicken, lamb, beef, and ribs."

Yesterday my aunt was verbally abused and belittled by their costumers and waiters, simply for asking for her food order to go. It's absolutely not acceptable behavior. I wish she would call 911 and FBI to report the incident. No one from the restaurant management got involved to stop them. I would not recommend this place to anyone."

It didn't take us long to decide what we wanted . Boyfriend and I ordered fettuccine Alfredo and spaghetti and meatballs alongside some fried calamari. Calamari was a little oily but over all good portion and tasted good. Alfredo was amazing ! Sauce was perfect and the noodles were perfection. (Could eat this everyday) Spaghetti and meatballs were great (according to my bf) We were also given bread. Tasted fresh and was nice and crispy.

We've visited little italy for the first time today and unfortunately the experience has left a sour taste in my mouth. This restaurant was beautiful, great ambiance and culture. The bread was fluffy, flaky, crunchy. Unmatched in our opinion. The vegetable lasagna and penne was the best pasta we've ever tasted. When the  bill came it went left. My fiancé pulled out his card without opening the bill but the waiter walked away. He was very inattentive. I opened the check and to my dismay I saw a service fee written in pen on the bottom of our check. The price went from $48 to $58. A card fee was also added for $1.97, apparently this is 4% of the bill. I've never seen a fee written in pen by a waiter. A service fee should be added to the receipt in a professional manner and to us it looked like he had scribbled any number on this receipt. Would've liked to dictate his service based on his actual service which was piss poor and rushed. Food is great service is not. I'd go somewhere else."

Outdoor seating was nice as the sun was setting and the street was livening up. This is definitely a family-run operation. The owner was outside taking to-go orders on the phone. I tried the Bucatini Amatriciana and it was delicious paired with a glass of the Pinot Noir. The entree had more meat sauce than pasta, but still a great choice. Complimentary bread served to the table as well. It wasn't mind-blowing Italian food, but it certainly tasted like it was made with love in a kitchen that has been in the business for over 50 years!"
248,DI_FoHY84hfzTWwlzF76aw,11/21/2021,3 star rating,Stopped by here with two friends during the Italian festival happening last month. It was extremely busy and the servers weren't all that attentive. They  also didn't tell us that we would be required to buy 3 dishes (one for each person) when we were seated. Each dish was quite expensive and the quality/quantity was really nothing special for the price we paid. I know this place has tons of great reviews but I personally didn't have a great impression nor did I feel like the servers took the effort to make my dining experience a memorable one.

With Horchata Lattes? Yes. I will be returning. This cafe is vegetarian, so I have a BLT made with tempeh on sourdough bread. It was good. It wasn't mind blowing, but it was a wholesome, nutritious breakfast. I had that with the pumpkin spice latte. The lovely woman behind the bar told me that they themselves roast the pumpkin and make it into a puree for the latte instead of using syrups. I love that, and you can certainly taste the difference. Great latte. Like I mention, I ended up staying here the entire day. It's a small space, but they do have wifi and comfortable seating. At some point, I tried the Horchata Latte. STAPLE menu item. Delicious. I am coming back for this specifically. I'll probably get the egg sandwich next time because it's on a croissant and the eggs looked so fluffy. Thank you, Tikal for such an amazing day spent here. Great lighting for pictures too :)Side note: it's rather cold in here. Dress warmly (bring a sweater/scarf in case)"

Came on a Sunday morning, wasn't very busy, but it took 30 minutes (!) to get an iced coffee and a hot drink and then 45 minutes for an açai bowl and an avocado toast. It seemed like our order kept getting forgotten since everyone else was getting their food...especially the Uber delivery guys  No one really checked in on us, so we finally just asked for our food to go. Food wasn't very spectacular especially for the prices. Maybe they still need to figure out a system that works, so if you decide to stop in for a coffee or food make sure you don't have anywhere else to be for a minute."

Just a tip maybe vacuum after dogs lay all up on your furniture because other people do not want to swat dog hair off their clothing after they eat !!! The rocket fuel cold brew was not it for me, definitely had a certain taste. I had to ask for more oat milk to drown out the flavor. The avocado toast was just bland no seasoning ... would not recommend to anyone I know ... won't be back to try anything else !"

258,Fm6RK2n3qF8F75-t3nHR-Q,5/16/2022,3 star rating,Cute little cafe. I've been in three times this week after having passed by for months. Day one I tried a vanilla latte.  It was vanilla you know. Day two though skeptical I tried the lavender latte. This was a winner. I didn't think that lavender and coffee/espresso would work out that well but it totally does. I also tried an almond croissant this morning that I wasn't that fond of but like I said the lavender latte is a hit.  My only thing is I asked for it today without the actual lavender sprinkled on top since I don't like the texture of it in my mouth.  I wanted no foam but the barista seemed to not get what I was asking for but that's fine.  Also the last time I was in I was charged $6.25 and for the same latte today it was $7.  I was mistakenly charged an add'l $.75 for almond milk which I didn't request and did not receive. I was told that almond milk was the default except both times prior I was asked what kind of milk I wanted. But considering the current rate of inflation it would not surprise me if the price has increased in price between Saturday and Monday but the online menu says $6.25 currently. I Didn't stress the $.75 but I'll pay attention the next time.

It's perfect for kids and kids at heart! We made reservations and were seated right away. Their Indian Chai tea is y favorite, so I did a pot of that. It comes with the milk already steeped in and is probably my favorite chai I've had. To eat, I had the smoked salmon sandwich. It is super simple, but delicious! There is tons of smoked salmon on it and I loved the dressing on the side salad. You can't come here without trying their scones! The pumpkin caramel is my favorite and it was served warm and right out of the oven. You can't beat it! The only negative is that the chairs are so uncomfortable. I sat on their booth/bench and it was super hard. Literally just a piece of wood. It would be nice if they could add some sort of cushion.I love this spot for a light but delicious lunch! You can also get their pastries to go which is an added bonus if you just need to get your scone fix!"

I was so disappointed in the entire experience. I have been to tea all over the country and usually it's such a fun and amazing experience... unfortunately that is not what I experienced here. From the moment we walked in it wasn't great. They weren't busy at all but there seemed to be confusion over where to seat us. Then we sat there for probably 15 minutes before the waiter came over. We got the tea for 2, but the way they do it really makes no sense. We would have saved $50 if we would have just gotten 3 separate teas. We only received 3 different sandwiches and 4 scones (the only difference would have been 3 scones). Everything was bland and kind of tasted dried out. Both the teas we got were bitter. The restaurant itself could use some updating. It felt dingy and it has seen better days. And unfortunately our service wasn't good at all. I NEVER leave one star reviews, but this just wasn't good in so many ways."

We ordered one of the afternoon tea sets (for two, if I remember correctly) and added on an extra scone because the flavors they had that day sounded interesting. The scones were large and looked appetizing but were very dry. The tea sandwiches and sweet treats were also just alright. I normally devour macarons but the two that came with our set were not very good. Overall, it not a very memorable experience, but not a bad one either. Just meh.

276,JmDZuDrYrtEKKVr0PypSVA,10/23/2020,2 star rating,"I will get this out of the way quickly, yes, this is the pizzeria that John Travolta (aka Tony Manero) buys two slices at, then struts down 86th street like a boss in the opening sequence of the film, ""Saturday Night Fever"".It is unfortunate I could not replicate this sequence, as it was hard to juggle my phone and the two slices to try and photograph the moment, and in Covid climate, I would look pretty stupid. So I ate the slices on a nearby bench. Lame. What is cool is that the D train runs alongside you as you walk down the street with your new purchases. That feels pretty special.As for the pizza, you get what you pay for. Two slices for roughly $6 gets you exactly that, a cheap tasting pizza. Solidly simple slices, nothing about them will blow you away. Bland in the sauce and cheese, crispy crust, little bit chew, but no wow factor to the overall flavor. In short, this is definitely not the best slice in the city. Not by a long shot.Even though Lenny's was made famous in a movie, it does not necessarily mean the pizza is good. If you want to stop here just to say you went here for the reason I just stated, go ahead. It is a small attraction, but it also acts like a local pizzeria. Nothing more or less. You get your slices and strut down the street glancing at people as you chomp down. That pretty much sums it up."

Properly thin and crispy crust, root beer, and that old school pizzeria vibe. They also made my poor vegan friend a cheese-less personal pizza, which j thought was really sweet."
286,JmDZuDrYrtEKKVr0PypSVA,10/23/2020,2 star rating,"I will get this out of the way quickly, yes, this is the pizzeria that John Travolta (aka Tony Manero) buys two slices at, then struts down 86th street like a boss in the opening sequence of the film, ""Saturday Night Fever"".It is unfortunate I could not replicate this sequence, as it was hard to juggle my phone and the two slices to try and photograph the moment, and in Covid climate, I would look pretty stupid. So I ate the slices on a nearby bench. Lame. What is cool is that the D train runs alongside you as you walk down the street with your new purchases. That feels pretty special.As for the pizza, you get what you pay for. Two slices for roughly $6 gets you exactly that, a cheap tasting pizza. Solidly simple slices, nothing about them will blow you away. Bland in the sauce and cheese, crispy crust, little bit chew, but no wow factor to the overall flavor. In short, this is definitely not the best slice in the city. Not by a long shot.Even though Lenny's was made famous in a movie, it does not necessarily mean the pizza is good. If you want to stop here just to say you went here for the reason I just stated, go ahead. It is a small attraction, but it also acts like a local pizzeria. Nothing more or less. You get your slices and strut down the street glancing at people as you chomp down. That pretty much sums it up."

I've come both late on a Saturday night and on a random Tuesday, and the atmospheres were completely different.Want a laid-back dive bar, complete with an outdoor patio? Perfect, come during the week. Want a thumping back room, with sweaty drunk millennials and plenty of dancing? Perfect, come during the weekend. It's always a good time.Tons of seating, cool vintage decor, big beer menu, reasonably priced drinks (with a $10 credit card minimum). Bartenders are pretty friendly and fast. They also let you bring in outside food, which is awesome - I came with an entire birthday cake once and lit it on fire, and no one batted an eye. Plus, it's easy to find! There are three diamonds. In their front door.I have a feeling this is going to become the bar I end up at- intentionally or not- when I'm out in Bushwick."

Very relaxed atmosphere and the perfect combo of divey and stylish.The blonde bartender was super cold to me, but otherwise nice service. The beer and shot specials are great. I had some tasty tequila cocktails as well. If you're even slightly attractive, hipster dudes will buy all your drinks for you. Highly recommended."

Prices are higher In comparison to other places that sell the same stuff. To their benefit, there's no other store with such food variety like it around the area in a 5-10 blocks radius. The food: large variety, fresh enough, clean enough. Large Buffet and a variety of other deli/supermarket products... enough for all tastes. Also  food from the grill, soups and make your own salads. You get your breakfast, lunch and Dinner products plus more. The Staff: on the grill/salads/soups behind the counter areas- some days are good some days are bad. You must repeat yourself if you want to get the right order- they have failed me more times than I can count. The guys are very interested in getting their flirt on most days than not. The cashiers are a hit or miss on the attitudes - some are adorable and friendly some are really straight from hell. If there was another store similar to this one within 1-2 blocks around this area I would rather go there (mostly because of service and prices). But it serves a purpose so I keep coming back. PS. You better bring cash if you plan on spending less than 5$ otherwise the cashiers will roll their eyes at you and tell you THERE'S AN 8$ minimum to charge your purchase.

A true surprise.My coworker were walking around NYC and needed a quick bit. Cafe 28 looked like an okay place for lunch. I really just wanted an energy bar or piece of fruit, but what I got instead was even better!The buffet selection was great! I piled my container with slices of steak, chicken, some marinated mushrooms, steamed veggies, lots of goodness. Got some strawberries and cantaloupe for dessert, too!Now, while the food was good, but service wasn't. Folks working the front ignored me and my coworker. I mean, I'm used to this typical New Yorker attitude. Unless you're a local and know how to talk to them, they'll ignore you until they're ready. When we were finally acknowledged, they weighed our food and we paid. The seating isn't great, but I'm guessing they don't want you to just lounge around. Not terrible.The bathroom was another story. Smelly and nasty. One stall was out of commission, so I was in a line of 10 people waiting. I wish I had had the strength to hold it because it was a mess inside. It's baaaad when you feel like throwing up as soon as you step inside. And I had just eaten all of that good food."

I went to try the bulgogi bowl, figuring that since they're clearly Korean owned they'd do it right. It's a great value: less than $9 for a huge bowl and a large serving of miso soup on the side. But as for flavor, I was a bit disappointed. Bulgogi is normally marinated and sweet but this barely seemed to have any marinade on it, so it was just somewhat dry pieces of beef on top of rice and some soggy steamed veggies. I almost wonder if they forgot a sauce that they were supposed to put on top of it. I wasn't thrilled with my choice, but I'd definitely go back there because there's so much to choose from, not much of a line, it's affordable, and there's a little seating area upstairs if you don't want to eat at your desk.

The food in the buffet was crusty and visibly old and dry. The employee behind the counter just stood there staring off into the distance. I ordered a grilled cheese because I didn't trust any of the food in the place, and it was two cold, solid pieces of American cheese on buttered bread. Charged me $5 for it. My friend ordered a panini that came with a bag of chips, but he also wanted Doritos but the cashier yelled, ""COMES WITH CHIPS"" and tossed his Doritos to the side, like he wasn't allowed to buy anything else. Not sure why he didn't want to sell more items? He also charged us for both of our meals together before us realizing, so we asked if we could pay separate and he grumpily yelled at us. The upstairs seating area is large, but filled with questionable clientele an the atmosphere is just extremely weird and creepy. Weird, weird vibes. Did I mention this place is weird?

They were very attentive to our needs and our indecisive nature. Food wise, it was really good. As non-new Yorkers we wanted to try a bunch of different things, and if there one thing this place has, it is selection. They have everything you might need while on the run. Also, their breakfast bagels are to die for. Atmosphere wise, it's your typical cafe. Not as mainstream as a Starbucks, but very decent and spacious. Also, we had a very cool conversation with two gentlemen sitting next to us one morning. We later found out that one of the was one of the actors from Bad Boys II. Overall, highly recommend if you just want some good breakfast on the city."
310,aoYDuvipcT_XGAM5ckFJnA,3/22/2016,3 star rating,"Otherwise known as the ""Dirty Water"" at my work, this place is one of those mediocre, yet edible places in the Financial District. It's really more like 2.5-Stars, but I rounded up cause of the convenience factor and cost.I work a block away on Wall Street, so I end up coming here when the weather is terrible outside, or for Oatmeal in the morning as that's one of their better things, along with the roast or fried chicken by the piece from the buffet counter.  If you do opt for the chicken, they bring it out at 10am, so I'd get it around then, otherwise, if you come at lunch (12pm-2pm), it's been sitting out for almost 4hrs and a ton of people have hovered over it.  I usually get it with my oatmeal and eat it then for a big breakfast or save it for lunch and reheat in the microwave.  Just my two cents.The Dirty Water is basically your standard New York Deli with a lunch buffet, but on the lower quality side.  Made-to-order breakfast items, wraps, sandwiches, etc, are all ok, but nothing to write home about.  I wouldn't go out of your way to come here, but if you're in the area and looking for something fast, hot, and relatively cheap, this is a good option."

It's $9.49 per pound and there were a few different tray options: styrofoam and plastic with varying sizes. I walked in right before lunch time so there were plenty of seats. They also make sandwiches, smoothies, sushi and Korean food. Lots of different options and all for a good price!"

I was delighted that you guys opened in my neighborhood and was looking forward to a long relationship with your deli. As a deli, my expectations for service is already at an all time low, but to experience what I had at 10:30 AM, June 7th, was unimaginable. Needless to say, it doesn't seem that the manager or the cashier woman cared to have my business so I will not be coming back nor will i recommend any of my co-workers, neighbors or the drug representative that buys my office lunches to partake in your morning manager's disrespect for customer service. If you are going to charge me the same price for a meal that I order in the evening and not give me the same order (with soups and sides), then you should charge less! Would you charge for a combo plate of burgers and fries and not give fries simple because I bought it too early and your oil wasn't hot enough to make fries? It's a gesture of good will, take 50 - 75 cents off, not say sorry you have to pay same price, disgusting!Telling a customer after they waited 15 minutes for a meal that they didn't fully received, that they need to pay full price, because they came too early is POOR customer service! You could have told me before making me wait that you didn't have the soup ready and let me make the decision on what to do, I happen to enjoy soup the soup and sides the most. Since I live and work in the neighborhood, I truly wanted to make you my  deli of choice amongst the hundreds of deli in the area, sadly you failed your company and the owner and I hope someone will show the manager that being fair to customers are important ways to grow a competitive business."

I've gone to there twice and both times had to walk out without a juice because she wouldn't make my juice. When I walk up to the counter, she looks surprised and inconvenienced that I am there. After she told me she couldn't make me my juice for the second time I asked her why this was a reoccurring issue and she started yelling about how it was a Monday morning and that's why she wasn't ready. Shouldn't it be standard that all of the stations are open when the restaurant is open? I've gone both times around 7am so it's not like I'm showing up at the crack on dawn. I won't be returning.

There are also ready-made foods like sandwiches and Korean bibambap and other dishes on the side bars, but I haven't personally tried them. The place is very busy during lunch hours but the lines move relatively quickly. Ok place to stop by for a quick takeout lunch if you're working in the Financial District area.

I know the rating is average, but overall, it is not only good, but you get a good amount of food for a little over $10. I had to shave a star because they don't always have the fish roe pasta (my fave) and the chicken and tofu tend to be a bit on the dry and overdone side.However, you get to pick 6 different things and most of them are pretty clean and healthy. If you're like me and like healthish food without always having a salad, I recommend this place."

Yes, the prepackaged bento boxes are still available, but they are generally not as good as they were when they first opened. The chirashi special that I raved about in 2014 which used to only be available on certain days of the week are generally available all the time now, but the rice to fish ratio leaves a lot to be desired (extreme amount of rice with very little fish). I am still quite partial to their sauce katsu don (fried chicken cutlet with sauce on rice) which is super yummy, and most of their grilled fish bentos are still not bad (although they sell out quickly). It's really now down to a 3.5 star, but the availability of a quick grab-and-go Japanese option in Grand Central makes it still worthwhile. I come and pick up onigiris a lot now here :) (two for $4.03 post tax!)"

I came a bit early today at 11:45am and had to wait for them to bring out the food. The chirashi bowls and salmon or tuna dons are $9 and tastes so good. Love their rice! I'm not sure what it's marinated with but it's delish! I got the sushi don and they also provide miso soup.

It was not super crowded despite it being lunch time. All staff wore masks. I came in at 1:15 was out by 1:45 pm. The Check came quickly after the waiter saw I was done. Ambiance: low light towards the back and bar. Fully lit at the front by the Window. The Miso soup was perfect and salted just right. It contains Mushrooms tofu and seaweed. Typical size of 6 oz. The Sushi came in 6 pieces. I had the Maki Lunch special and ordered the spicy tuna roll and yellowtail jalapeño. The spicy tuna was great and exactly what I was expecting while the yellowtail was refreshing, light, and barely spicy.The sushi was served with ginger and wasabi. The soy sauce is already on the table so you can choose how much you have. I do recommend asking for only half the ginger as the portion they give is quite large. Overall great experience and I'll definitely come again!"

The delivery person came to my door and I clearly stated ""leave at door"" on the app. I assume since ooki's delivery drivers work directly for the restaurant the message was not delivered. I am sick with COVID so I wanted the order to be left at door. The driver banged on my door for 3 minutes refusing to leave the order and telling me I needed to open up. I opened and he demanded I give him cash for the order even though I already paid on Uber eats by using Apple Pay. It was hard to communicate because he hardly spoke English and he called the restaurant on his phone but they didn't speak English either so my message was not getting across. I am frustrated and was very afraid in the moment and can't believe I'm even typing this. Be careful when ordering from here because the delivery people are extremely aggressive and try to scam you by demanding cash when they arrive at your residence!"

And they were hardcore cleaning when I came in. I can only afford to do lunch specials these days and theirs is pretty comparable to the ones in the neighborhood. $10.50 for two rolls and a soup or salad. And compared to every other spot on UES, their miso soup is the best I've had! The wine is a bit pricy for lunch... $11 a glass but they did give me a very generous pour. If they did a happy hour deal, I'd be here OFTEN. They even opened the windows and allowed me to eat outside! I love the staff and if the sushi wasn't great (it was!) I would come back to see these sweet peeps."

I wanted a quick sushi lunch and changed dine in to take out last minute and they were very understanding. The miso soup is delicious and my favorite roll was the white tuna spicy crunch roll. Yum! For $15, 3 maki rolls is not bad."

336,c869kkUkjPM5nSGeJqVosg,2/26/2022,5 star rating,I have started coming here pretty often as it is my favorite sushi spot in Yorkville. They have a great menu with a variety of different Japanese cuisine options depending on what you are looking for. I love their Age Tofu and Salmon Avocado roll. They also have a great selection of vegetarian rolls that are all only $5.50. My boyfriend says the sweet potato tempura roll is the best and his favorite. The atmosphere and interior of Ooki is really nice and feels so upscale and charming. The staff are always very friendly and attentive as well. Ooki is a great place whether you want to go for a quick lunch or for a nice dinner.

I popped in the shop to chat with the person taking orders. He was super friendly and helpful with my inquiries into oils used, etc. Ordered the salad for me and the sliders for my wife. Both of us were very happy! Looking forward to trying a burger sometime."
341,BCwSqk9WY5woPkWEkvWkMg,10/11/2021,5 star rating,"WOW, Bronson's Burger is definitely up there in terms of the quality of the burger. Let's say it went beyond my expectation. There is an option to eat inside or outside. To order your meal and pay, it is through the QR code. The food came pretty quickly right when you submit your order.  I ordered Bronson's Burger which comes with caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, and pickles. I added tomatoes and lettuce for .75 cents each (it should already be included in my own opinion). Other than that, the burger was SO juicy and the buns were buttery too. Really really good burger. We also ordered buffalo chicken bites, skinny fries, sweet potato fries, and cheeseburger hashbrown (thought it was a bit dry). Next time, I'll try the Braonsons Bacon Burger which comes with bacon, mushrooms, and crispy onions. You can build your own burger too. Highly recommend this spot if you're looking to try a new burger spot. It did not disappoint thats forsure."
342,BCwSqk9WY5woPkWEkvWkMg,4/21/2022,4 star rating,Cute place in the West Village.  You order & pay on your phone and your food is brought to your table.The burgers are spot on.  I didn't really see a spot for requesting a certain temp on the burger so I received what must be the standard- medium rare.  The burger was made fresh (not frozen) and the beef was of very good quality.  These are very juicy burgers so they are messy.  The bun is a soft brioche bun.Had the truffle skinny fries.  The fries were cooked perfectly and are pretty skinny without being matchstick.  The truffle flavor was lacking however.Would definitely eat here again.
343,BCwSqk9WY5woPkWEkvWkMg,1/22/2023,4 star rating,"Stumbled upon this on my first night in the city - quick service, a solid burger. It was a bit greasy but tasted fresh and delicious! The fries were underwhelming, I'm not sure I would order again."

Used a QR code to order which was easy, but it was difficult to customize there, but the staff was happy to change anything we needed once we submitted the order. Gluten free buns or lettuce wrap made it an easy choice for us!"

346,BCwSqk9WY5woPkWEkvWkMg,4/10/2022,4 star rating,"We were able to walk in without wait during lunch on a Sunday. The service was very quick, and you pay before hand so there isn't much waiting around for the servers. Food came in around 10 minutes even while it was packed.BYO Burger (4.5/5): Would highly recommend the crispy onions, and the bun was amazing as well. Only thing was that I couldn't really taste much sauce, and the burger was cooked through which I don't prefer. Large portions and great for the price though!Fries (4.5/5): Not much to say, standard skinny, crispy fries that are not too salty or sweet. They come with ketchup and another sauce which was good.Tempura Onion Rings (2/5): The onion rings were pretty soggy, and probably could've been fried once more to be honest. The portions were okay and pretty cheap coming in at $3, but I can't really recommend them.Would recommend the place for a quick place to eat around Soho."
347,BCwSqk9WY5woPkWEkvWkMg,5/18/2022,4 star rating,"Almost walked right by this place, the inside is pretty dimly lit and didn't look too inviting but they have a nice outdoor space. Got served some water right away and theres a QR to an app you can order from. Food came out very quickly! Got the Bronson Burger (pretty good, excellent bun but way too many pickles than belongs in a burger), chicken sandwich (not bad), onion rings (pretty interesting, crispy light batter and fat onions, wouldnt skip on trying this), and chocolate malt shake (the best part of the meal tbh it was bomb). The price is very reasonable but I feel like the food could use a little mmm je ne sais quois, like it was good I'd definitely come again but nothing really stood out."
348,BCwSqk9WY5woPkWEkvWkMg,1/20/2022,5 star rating,"Bronson's Burgers is such a cozy and chill spot. All of the staff are also very nice and welcoming. Just excellent customer service overall and this is one of the main reasons I keep returning in addition to the food just being tasty. I love the veggie burger from here and always build my own with my choice of toppings. I want to highlight that the Gluten Free bun is actually good and that is always not the case so I greatly appreciate that. Further, the fries are just so delicious especially with their BBQ mayo sauce. I also cannot come here without getting the Blueberry Mint Lemonade - So so good! I haven't been able to try any of their shakes, but they are oat milk based and I'll definitely be back to try! I do both dine in and take out here. One thing that I want to note is that they actually look at the notes you leave when placing your online order -- this is almost unheard of! Whether it's me asking for extra sauce, no onions, or extra pickles, my requests are always accepted which is just amazing.This is a great place to dine in with friends especially when you want to go somewhere to eat that isn't a fully sit down restaurant experience, but still want to dine in. It's super easy to order using the QR code on the table and the food comes out relatively quick.Overall, it is a 10/10 and a great addition to the Soho neighborhood!"
349,BCwSqk9WY5woPkWEkvWkMg,10/2/2021,4 star rating,"A burger joint from the team behind Wayla and Kimika? This I've got to try. I went with the Bacon Burger, Skinny Fries and Basil Lemonade.  The burger was juicy. The bun was buttery. The bacon marmalade was a bit too sweet for my liking but still an interesting counter to the other savory add ons - crispy onions and sautéed mushrooms. Each bit was quite rich (and sweet), so I was thankful to have the basil lemonade on hand. If there's a next time, I'll likely build my own burger or try the chicken sandwich."
350,EaAAP-gDALDL7GxcseMjBQ,10/12/2022,5 star rating,Exceptional service and food.Such a fun restaurant! You totally feel like you are part of the Ralph Lauren brand and the food and drinks are amazing
351,EaAAP-gDALDL7GxcseMjBQ,12/11/2022,5 star rating,"Such a classic spot! I've been here a handful of times, and they always knock it out of the park. The ambiance is unmatched - even though it's a posh spot, it still has the comfort of feeling like you're in a cozy living room. The food is spectacular too - I highly recommend their pigs in a blanket, burger, shrimp cocktail, and brussel sprouts. They also have amazing hot chocolate for those colder days. If you're lucky enough to score a res, DO IT."
352,EaAAP-gDALDL7GxcseMjBQ,12/9/2022,5 star rating,"Supposed to see 4 stars - this restaurant is obviously expensive and has an insane celebrity hype. But that's the fun of it! Make sure to get a reservation a month in advance exactly. And call at exactly 10am. The food was incredible, slightly limited menu but the pigs in the blanket were top notch. Our drinks were adorable and fantastic. The restaurant is beautiful and you definitely partially pay for the experience. It's nice to actually dine - we had Great service and were never rushed. We probably spent 2 hours at the restaurant just enjoying and taking our time. Highlight was the chocolate cake. 10/10!"
353,EaAAP-gDALDL7GxcseMjBQ,4/16/2023,4 star rating,"I've been to the polo bar many times and each time does not disappoint. First and foremost, I would not recommend going here if you're not interested in the burger, corned beef sandwich or steak. All are extremely top tier in comparison to other dining services in the city. It is difficult to acquire a reservation, but not impossible, and easier if you know the right people/know what to ask - unfortunately, I will not be giving away my secret. Try to come to your reservation a little earlier so you can enjoy a beverage plus drink snacks by the bar, which is a really pretty area, especially around the holidays. Also don't bother to come in without a reservation unless it's Labor Day - they will tell you they're fully committed at the door. The hosts are always overly welcome and accommodating and will lead you downstairs when your table is ready. The restaurant looks like a quintessential Ralph Lauren boutique and the patrons are usually dressed to the nines. The service here is impeccable - the drinks are well made and they offer popovers free of charge. From the appetizers, I would recommend the Caesar salad (it has big croutons), crab cakes, and if you want to spend the money, the pigs in a blanket. I found the calamari to be inedible and the tuna tartare to be stale. The caviar potatoes are not worth the price. The only entrees I would recommend are the steak, corned beef, and burger, as I mentioned before. There's usually a special burger - only get it if you've already had the polo bar burger. For dessert, you will never go wrong with the chocolate cake and they usually have pretty good specials around the holidays. Note to polo bar: PLEASE BRING BACK THE HOT DOG!!!!"
354,EaAAP-gDALDL7GxcseMjBQ,3/7/2023,4 star rating,"The food is average but I think that is already expected. The atmosphere and fact that it's one of the hardest reservations to get, I surmise, adds to the whole appeal of dining here. Can't even get inside the door without reservations. May-spot-a-celebrity kind of place (did see one despite only being able to snag 5pm reservation on a Saturday). The service is also great and I didn't feel too rushed, despite being told I had to leave the table at 7pm for the next table. There is an option to find a seat at the bar upstairs after dinner, if needed. If I was able to get a other reservation in the future, I would visit again."
355,EaAAP-gDALDL7GxcseMjBQ,11/16/2022,5 star rating,"One of my fave restaurants in the city. If you're ever able to get a reservation here, run- don't walk. The service, the food, the atmosphere, all perfection. This is a restaurant that definitely meets its high expectations.Their signature burger and roast beef sandwiches are amazing. I recommend splitting everything so you can try as much as possible. I went with a party of 3 and they split the burger and sandwich 3 ways for us, which was so accommodating.You can't just go for drinks as there is a security guard at the front door, and if you're not on the list for a dinner table, then you can't get in."

From the moment I entered and was greeted with a warm and friendly smile by Jennifer, I was immediately enamored. I had not visited this establishment in ten years and was unaware that HOGSALT was now the proprietor of the NYC CLASSIC. I was seated promptly at a small table, though I was hesitant to sit alone, Jennifer convinced me. I was fortunate enough to be served by Keita, who was busy yet still found time to keep me entertained and provide me with whatever I needed. I promised to return soon, yet it has been three weeks due to my work schedule. Monkey Bar had me at hello!!  Justin M."

The ambiance is great from the moment you step in the door (bar upstairs, restaurant is downstairs). The meal starts with a warm popover which I could easily eat every day. You must get the classic burger - comes with fries that are plentiful and delicious. The service is excellent and I look forward to returning so I can try their pigs in a blanket and martinis."

We had the shrimp cocktail (5 huge shrimp) mushroom soup, burger, fries, and corned beef sandwich all of which were so good! We will definitely be back!"
359,EaAAP-gDALDL7GxcseMjBQ,12/26/2022,4 star rating,"This place is timeliness... you can feel the exclusivity just by passing the place let alone stepping inside. Yes, the reservation process is a hassle but I feel we still need some of that these days! When everything can be experienced through a tiktok or Instagram reel, the Polo Bar still keeps that air of exclusivity with their tough door, and it honestly does make your dining experience feel a little more elevated. When I do have a reservation here, my favorite thing to do is arrive s little early so I can sit at the bar and have a cocktail. While their drink menu has a nice variety, their bartenders have no qualms about whipping up whatever you like. The fried olives, nuts and potato chips to snack on are also one of my favorite things, too. Now, on to dinner... going down the sweeping staircase (or taking the elevator) down to their buzzing dining room is such a sweeping energy filled rush! If you're able to get a corner booth, enjoy the people watching you can do while you dine on their dinner menu items. My pro tip? Don't come here without getting something off of the specials of the evening b/c you'll absolutely regret it if you don't! Some of my favorite things eaten ever come from their specials... from the tuna burger to the salmon carpaccio, their specials are amazing. As for menu items? I'm a big fan of their ribeye and their tuna tartare. Now because of the hustle and bustle you may feel that the service can be a tad bit more attentive but I always feel they do what they can while dealing with the volume the best they can. Long story short? Go if you can as it's certainly an experience - especially if you like to dine out. Polo Bar... you're a classic!"

362,ehdmja52dNhEf_Yyipf0eA,8/12/2019,3 star rating,I've come here two other times before and it's not my favorite of spots BUT it gets the job done if you're hungry. I've tried the shrimp tacos which was alright and today the shrimp burrito. They cook their food on a grill so it definitely has the Smokey taste to it but I think it's a bit much and I normally like my grilled food to have that taste. There was an appetizer of calamari ordered and it didn't have much seasoning it tasted really fried. Again when your hungry that is the spot to go to because it won't really dent your pockets it's average priced.
363,ehdmja52dNhEf_Yyipf0eA,11/8/2020,4 star rating,"Amazing restaurant honestly would give 5 stars but we asked for a medium rare steak and got it well done.

Would love to go back."
364,ehdmja52dNhEf_Yyipf0eA,3/7/2020,3 star rating,So I was craving tacos and I started to search on UberEats. Came across this place and off course I came here for the reviews. The reviews looked good for the most part and I placed my order.I ordered the steak tacos which does say it comes with 3 tacos and a side of rice and beans and I ordered fried plantains. When my food came it was only three tacos just topped with onions and lime slices on the side no rice no beans and my separate order of fried plantains which they do give you a lot.The plantains has a weird taste and it wasn't even sweet so I threw them away and the tacos were just ok. It wasn't anything spectacular that would make me order again. So the search continues for a good taco spot smh
365,ehdmja52dNhEf_Yyipf0eA,1/8/2020,5 star rating,"Loveee this spot. This is my go to place for lunch. They have lunch specials under 10$ and frozen margaritas for 5$. There food is always good. In the neighborhood and looking for a place for lunch, stop here !"

I might be biased since I live in Brooklyn and have plenty of great bagel spots around me but I thought these were pretty average. They got a good bite to them and provided a decent amount of exercise for my jaw. It was topped with a perfect amount of cream cheese. Service was fast. Definitely a nice spot to pick up a bagel and go to work.

375,u9zVZH0liQu9skIz1kGrMA,9/12/2020,4 star rating,Parked in front of this place originally to get breakfast from Clinton Street Baking Company and when was enticed by the descriptive nova lox listed on their sidewalk menu. There are tons of options here! I think every picky eater would find something here. The whole wall is covered with their menu. I ordered the nova lox on whole wheat. The bagel was nice and warm and jam packed (see pic). My only complaint is the steep price and cash only. Total with tax was $10.34. Many cops were here grabbing breakfast on a Saturday morning.
376,u9zVZH0liQu9skIz1kGrMA,1/4/2023,1 star rating,"Folks, I don't know who gave this place four to five stars. Maybe there was a time the place was great but no more, not yesterday. Given this place sits a few blocks from Russ & Daughters and Katz on E Houston, you would think they would step up to the five star competition. I dropped in yesterday at about 330 PM. The selection of bagels was very limited. A few plain, no salt, no sesame - leftovers. The guy behind the counter was in the back mopping and came over after a while without washing his hands. The ingredients for schmearing weren't in a refrigerated case and didn't look appetizing and overall the place looked dingy. Walk a few blocks to R&D. Even in the rain it was worth the walk."

I tried a ham, cheese egg sandwich on a wheat bagel.  The sandwich was $4.25 and I could not finish it.  The bagel was so fresh and soft. My daughter tried the egg white veggie burrito for $4.50.  It also was very good. There is no indoor seating,  but there are a few outdoor tables . Great taste and value"

I walked home (2 short blocks) and once I opened the food everything was ice cold - if it was ready why was I made to wait 10 minutes while it got cold?? Regardless, they left out 2 pieces of Samsa completely, and gave us cold and hard shish kabobs instead of Adana kabobs like we ordered. I know mistakes happen, so I called them and tried to explain that I received the wrong order and was missing my 2 Samsas - the guy who picked up proceeded to hang up the phone right in my face!! My mom called them and spoke to them in Russian, they said they'll talk to the owner and call me back. It's been half an hour and no call back, and I'm not holding my breath for one either. I'm gonna order some pizza and walk over there myself and see if they will rectify this customer service nightmare of a situation."

He took our order and was very nice and patient in describing the different dishes and answering all our questions. We got the food to go, we ordered the lamb Adana, beef kofta, and 3 Adana sandwiches. The food was really good, fresh, and flavorful. The only thing I didn't like was the sauce on the side - it tasted like blended tomatoes with no other flavors or spices. I was hoping for some spicy sauce or white sauce, but that's ok! Will be going back!"

Hope they will stay like this all the time.  Previous owners of this place couldn't manage the restaurant they lost all the clients service and food use to be very bad. Hope this time works out and they'll stay same as now. They renovate the place. Very quick service and great food. I'll be back there again !! Thank you !!

How ever the waiter, a young girl started taking our orders without a paper and pen and TOWARDS THE END TAKES OUT HER PHONE to write down the last couple of orders. when it came to serving our food she mixed up our orders and said ""this is what we asked for"" We asked her to take certain things back and explained that wasn't what we ordered... she took it back but with an attitude and talked backed. we explained to her as part of owning a restaurant customer service is very important and she should be more responsible to get the orders on point next time and not have something to say back to me. On top of the horrible service they put a service charge of 10 percent on my bill. What's that all about? They waiter did not deserve a tip at all. I'm sorry"

I highly recommend to those who wants to eat Central Asian food such as Uzbek and Tajik. I am eating in this place minimum twice a week. If you visit them on weekend, you need a reservation for dinner because of crowded people and you can enjoy live music!"
385,iy1AZhDzBejmG8Uydo7SoA,2/19/2018,3 star rating,"Let's start with the decor, definitely a 5 out of 5... As some of the other reviewers have said, you feel like a monarch! Ironically for the location, you wouldn't expect such a grandiose feeling in a restaurant. As for the food, I went there yesterday, and supposedly the chef was out sick, so the menu options were limited. Had no idea who was cooking the food. Overall the food was just average, we had their Cornish hen which was a bit burnt. The lamb ribs were good, but needed some more flavor. They were big on this red sauce, which just tasted like marinara sauce that was diluted. The french fries were good. The bread was overly toasted, too hard. Overall I might give this place another shot in the distant future when the chef returns. But as of now, food-wise this place is about average. The decor kind of makes up for it, but then the mandatory service charge kind of ruins it. We were a party of 4 and were charged 10% mandatory service charge, what's that all about?"

As we start to order the waitress is empty handed , about two items after she says wait let me take it down on my phone. Towards the end of the order when we ask her for the traditional dumplings instead of a certain soup she says let me check if we have it. She leaves and doesn't come back . Then when she starts to bring our food I u it let me tell she fuks up, rosy of alldoesnt hear u out just says ok ok and leaves. Bi the food that we dd have"

Shame on me for being too into our conversation and not leaving sooner. Save your money, time and bowels. *masks worn by staff the entire time as a very important chin guard. Not once did the mask reach the mouth or nose or both. *food was 2 stars at best; we ordered nachos and chicken nuggets (and not by our choice, chicken wings) - all looked like they had been sitting for a while; room temperature, cheese on the nachos was now solid, etc. *drinks were 2 stars - still trying to figure out if there was alcohol in them*careful when ordering - we ordered the chicken nuggets/wings, not realizing it was one or the other. The waiter didn't confirm which we wanted and brought out both. We barely touched the wings, which also slightly resembled JimCarrey as Fire Marshal Bill - they were probably overcooked by about 43 minutes. *something most definitely didn't agree with me from GB&K. After arriving home, I felt nauseous, had stomach cramps, etc. Concerned it was food poisoning but after an hour or so, I was able to fall asleep. Woke up this morning and my stomach is still off but feeling a bit better.Giving this place 2 stars because:a) they can easily step their game up if they wantb) wasted $130 - but got to catch up with a friendc) optimistic that this was an off day"

I chose this as a happy hour spot in LIC because online it said til 7pm and when we arrived-it was only til 6pm and I had to quickly order and chug. Please update your hours on the website accordingly. The tacos were pretty good, with the sauce being amazing...two is actually filling so I had an extra taco for leftovers. My friend had the pork and said it was pretty good too. Our waiter didn't really attend to us and I had to flag them down when we needed more drinks/to order/to pay. When food was delivered, some of the sauce fell on my pants as the waiter handed it to me which was overextended and I was already in a bad mood from that point-with no apology or anything from the waiter even though they saw it happen. I guess it's convenient and good for the area but not sure if the best place for HH or service."

Simple bar showing a bunch of games and various types of seating in the small-ish establishment.Menu is limited in options; generally a good sign as they are trying not to do too much. Opted for the Guac and Chips ($6) to go along with daily special Pretzel ($11) and a beer ($8). Chips are served by the large handful and with a dollop of guacamole. Ratio wise, would have preferred more guac and slightly warmer chips, but overall a decent starter. Pretzel is giant - salted and buttered with three types of dips (mustard, cheese, glaze). Liked the pretzel, wasn't a fan of the dips except the spicy mustard. Beer list had mostly standard options, but the Goose IPA is always a plus.Good watering hole to watch a game in a low-key setting. Would stick to drinks next time."

So I remain single. But never would I have imagined that I would be one day be catfished by a restaurant...twice.   I live around the corner from Bar Basic. I've eaten there a few times. Always happy with the food but underwhelmed by the service and prices. Once the pandemic hit I turned to seamless as so many of us have. At one point tired of the usual stuff I searched for something new. Low and behold this new Butger joint opened up. I ordered the yummy looking although wallet damaging burger and was shocked when it arrived. The receipt was from Bar Basic.   I chuckled and tipped my hat to their ingenuity. A quick online rebrand to keep a local business afloat. Good idea. A little misleading, but not super immoral. I would never have ordered from Bar Basic. I had tried their burger before and it wasn't for me. So they got me...and I was ok with it.   But today they got me again. I was in a classic single dad bind and looking for a healthy dinner option for my daughter. I see a cool new salad place called Twisted Salads just opened up around the corner. I decided to walk up and check it out. And much to my surprise, it was Bar Basic...again. The salad was yummy, pricey but yummy.   In conclusion, I have decided I am not fit for online dating nor am I fit for online eating. Actually, I'm not fit for online. If I can be catfished twice by a restaurant who knows what else I'm susceptible to! I just have to live off of Da Nona Rosa until I can figure out a better solution. P.S.  Just had a great idea, next rebrand you HAVE TO name yourselves Catfish !"

We had stumbled by chance and loved it. It was never on Yelp or on Google; so we weren't able to find it but knew it was around the neighborhood of Ramen Danbo & Banhmigos. It had cool artwork of Studio Ghilbi everywhere and awesome burgers.So, on 11/23 we decided to come and look for it as we really enjoyed this location. We yelped Banhmigos, parked and walked around looking. We found Bar Basic in the exact location and it still have some of the original artworks. It looked about the same layout but of course new decors. We were excited to try it anyways as it has burgers on the menu. I guess the soft opening failed and now Bar Basic took over.

On my first visit, one of the staff members got into a screaming fight with a customer. I've worked in restaurants and patronized plenty, but never in my life have I seen something like that. The man - a bartender or server I wasn't sure - called the customer names and threatened to hit him. It was so over the line and inappropriate. And I get it, customers can be a pain but...to threaten physical violence? Over a dinner order? Pretty inexcusable in my book. So that put a very sour taste in my mouth but everyone deserves a second chance so...The second visit was the one that clinched the deal for me. Not only was the food awful - soggy elote, dry tasteless tacos, bland appetizers - but the drinks were bad! It's pretty hard to screw up a cocktail but they did. I ordered a Paloma - very bitter, watery and full of pulp. So yeah, I won't be back here ever. If you're  hungry and need kind, quick service, the Chinese place next door is lovely."

While enjoying being outside and spaced away from others, I had a fish taco, al pastor taco, nachos and a churro dessert with ice cream. I felt the plates were filling for the price and actually tasted fresh and savory. I also had a mai tai and shots that were part of happy hour until 6pm. They kept me warm outside but I do see myself being cold with no heat lamps or plastic bubble. The staff was friendly and funny. Overall the bar was an easy going space with great food and drinks."

This place was 2 blocks away so I called for a pick up order since it was only a 20 minutes wait compared to the 1 hour wait as delivery. Their phone cut off for the first 3 seconds after picking up then it connected again, which made me think I was hung up on at first, but I guess I was put on hold without notice. The female on the phone was very curt and repeated ""anything else?"" with an obviously impatient tone every sentence I spoke. Bad sign.Called in again in 10 minutes to switch the order to Delivery due to a disturbance at home and was unable to go pick it up. She insisted that it cannot be switched, but I apologized and said I literally live 2 blocks away and she finally conceded (with a stern rebuke) . Told her the address and apartment number #C and phone number. Asked to pay ahead with credit card, and she vehemently refused. Fine. I let it go and was willing to pay with cash on my end since I'm the one who made an abrupt change. 50 minutes later as we were patiently waiting for the food and is getting ever more so hangry, my SO called them to see what's up.Apparently they had gone ahead and canceled our order after a delivery attempt without telling us. Their delivery guy actually rung #D instead of #C, but failed to call us or make any attempt to communicate with us (why take my phone number if you're not going to call me?). It wasn't even anywhere close to their closing time and we were already hangry. So, I can't comment on their food as we did not even get the food. I'd give 0 stars if I could for their incomprehensible attitude and service. Will not call again or even visit the establishment.*edited for grammar and spelling only*"

I leave and come back a few minutes later and they said I needed to wait 7 more minutes. I asked them how was this possible when I put the order in a half an hour ago and it is still not ready? Then one of them looks over to another counter and my food was right there, bagged up. No apologies for the mishap or anything. This business lost my patronage for good."

I had the half chicken with rice and beans and mashed potatoes. I know that's a lot of starch but I couldn't decide on which one to try for the first time! The first bite into the chicken was marvelous! The Peruvian flavors were a burst of delight and joy. The skin had an enormous amount of flavor that took me back. This was the best chicken that I've had since Pio Pio 8 in Manhattan. The mashed potatoes were hot and seasoned well. The rice and beans  were a great addition as well. I would recommend paying the extra money to get two pieces of dark meat instead of white meat due to the dark meat being very moist. Since this review I've ordered from here about five times and that was all I'm about a two week span! I'm addicted! I also tried my mother's garlic shrimp and that was very delicious as well.

I have had way better rotisserie from grocery stores... The customer service is terrible. The people barely look or speak to you when you come in to order, always have attitude and can't wait to charge extra for some little sauce, when you buy small orders like soup or mash potatoes,  which should already be cooked, it takes them 20-25 mins before it's ready. My favorite item to order from any restaurant is calamari... I ordered this one day and when I got home it was rock hard and barely edible... I give the 2 stars because the soup is usually good on certain days(Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday) and the mash potatoes if I just need a side to go with food I made at home... but otherwise don't waste your time of money for  horrible service and food that they just slap together with no consideration that someone actually paid for it."

The chicken had a nice flavor but it was dry, the plantain were soggy, but on the bright side, the green sauce was yummy! So I'll say this maybe I caught them on a bad day but I expect professionalism from a professional establishment.

Today I was dissatisfied with the service received. When people are picking up orders they need to do a better job at verifying they are giving the person the right order. To be told my order was given to the wrong person by mistake and they would do it over but I would have to wait another 30-40 minutes is not acceptable. I understand the new normal based on the pandemic and new procedures. However, good customer service should still exist. Even when I gave the suggestion they should make sure the person can verify what was ordered and who placed the order, the worker didn't seem to care. Besides offering an apology there was no additional effort on their part to make amends for their mistake."

I had a hankering for butternut squash soup today when I walked past their sign advertising the soup of the day. If I ask you if you're set up for soup early in the morning (before 9am), and you're not, just be honest and I'll order something else! It's okay. You probably don't have lunch set up. But it was clear that the soup wasn't set up or ready. I saw the guy in the back pouring a cup full into a pan (yes, a pan, where he was just making scrambled eggs for the breakfast options), heating it up in a pan, poured it into a paper to go cup. The soup topping wasn't set up yet so he squeeze bottled some kind of cream (?) or sour cream (?). The soup was bland, zero flavor. And the cream on top curdled weirdly. I think they just dumped some out from the fridge and heated it up quickly so it was unevenly cooked. Really friendly guys, the breakfast menu looks really good. Next time I'll just stick with breakfast sandwiches for breakfast."

The chicken sandwich was AMAZING! The flavor was outstanding. The crunchiness of the roared sesame bun made me so happy. The chicken is also full on grilled chicken breast which is fantastic.

Fast and nice service. Exactly what you would expect from a coffee shop, nothing too special nor stands out. The location is good though. My only complaint was that it started to rain and there was no covering where we were sitting (on the street) and had to move next door to Motel Morris. The weather is not a factor for the 3 stars, however, the response to weather is since there was no covering available outside. Stop by for a quick conversation with friends or to take a break from your busy working from home day!"
424,9BM1-Obd5Dr8pErgyBbQAQ,2/18/2020,5 star rating,"Hands down my favorite cafe in Chelsea. The coffee is superb, and you can tell that each and every employee is not only happy to be there, but passionate about delivering excellent service with a friendly smile. I've lived in the area for a little over a year, and The Commons really makes it feel like a community. They get to know their regulars, and the space itself is perfect for a chill Sunday brunch. They also have a rule against working on your laptop during certain hours, which is great because it can be tough to snag a seat sometimes (especially when people are hunkered down like they're at a WeWork or something). I like this type of subtle policing when it serves customers favorably. Lastly, the food is incredible. People rave about the avocado toast. I've not had it yet because I can't imagine not ordering the Commons Bagel. It's just lox and scallion cream cheese, but something about this bagel just tastes better than a lot of other actual bagel shops. The rest of the menu looks and smells great so maybe one day I'll venture away from my usual suspect. Overall, I highly, highly recommend The Commons Chelsea. NYC needs more quaint neighborhood spots like this that actually have GREAT food and coffee. My only hesitation with this review is writing it in general, mainly because I don't want this place to get more full than it already is on the weekends!!"
425,9BM1-Obd5Dr8pErgyBbQAQ,10/17/2018,4 star rating,The commons is an awesome spot in Chelsea. Small but very delicious menu of breakfast and lunch items. I always love their daily soups! They always serve Colombo coffee :)The only downfall to this spot is the size. It's super small so you can't guarantee you'll get a seat. They also don't have any gluten free bread options :( But all of their food is very tasty and of course fresh and the owner and staff are incredibly friendly and helpful.

There isn't much seating. I was able to get a seat at 3 pm, but the place might be packed at peak times."
427,9BM1-Obd5Dr8pErgyBbQAQ,3/31/2021,4 star rating,"I have to admit, The Commons Chelsea was really amazing. Very cute spot with great prices and good choices. I am very happy that we bought Avocado Toast, this was one of their finest dishes, very flavorful and delicious. Terrific. Awesome service and staff. Will always look forward to coming in here!"
428,9BM1-Obd5Dr8pErgyBbQAQ,8/11/2017,4 star rating,"This tiny restaurant exceeded my expectations. I was convinced my friend and I would have to wait atleast 30 minutes for a seat during lunch hours but it was the opposite, we automatically got seats (at 1:30pm - prime lunch time) and was able to order quickly. I ordered the pork sandwich which was tangy, spicy and juicy (the pork). It was overall very flavorful. It came with a side of salad that I barely touched because I was too busy enjoying the pork and the big fluffy sesame bun it floated on. My friend ordered the mushroom toast (it does not sound appealing when you see it written out) but believe me when you taste this toast it's heavenly. I was tempted to get a wine but decided to get the blood orange iced tea instead. It's unsweetened so it was a healthier option. We shared a side of roasted Brussel sprouts and they came out the only way I like them: with crispy bacon. Mouth orgasm level 10. Tips: -They sell glasses of Rosé (and other alcohol but most importantly they serve Rosé). - You have to order at the counter. - They have a no laptop policy during the week (I overheard a discussion while eating) - It's a bit pricy, my sandwich and juice came out to $17 which is beyond what I like to spend on lunches but it was good to experience."
429,nvTE9vtXCoYvF9-l6PZMVw,4/8/2023,2 star rating,Would not recommend. Portions were small and the Chicken Parm was the blandest chicken parm I've ever had in my life. Didn't know it was possible to make a bad chicken parm. Definitely recommend going next door to the real restaurant. Can't be any worse.
430,nvTE9vtXCoYvF9-l6PZMVw,3/26/2022,5 star rating,"The place is great for a group or date night. It's dim light and average in noise so you can head yourself talk.For apps we ordered a pizza and grilled octopus. The pizza was delicious and the grilled octopus was also good, meaty. I would have liked it more charred. For entrees we really ordered 5 different pastas to share. Yes carb overload and don't know what we were thinking but we loved them all. We ordered: ricotta & spinach- yum; gnocchi- my favorite; pesto de broccoli- my least favorite; cavatelli chicken Ragu- also delicious; veal agnatoli- my second fav. Desserts we had the olive cake (just okay) and the sundae (yum). The service was also great, they were okay with making half our pizza with no meat. Very friendly all around."
431,nvTE9vtXCoYvF9-l6PZMVw,8/9/2022,4 star rating,"It's the pizza for me. So freaking good. I've been an Uva patron for more than a decade, the spot crushes the pasta game. Usher in Next Door, and that's where it's at for pizza and cocktails. The vibe is romantic, cozy, and intimate. I love love love love the pizza. The crust is where it's at. We got some pasta too, and while at first, it wasn't perfect - way too salty, they were open to feedback, quickly sorted it and got a fresh - and much better tasting dish. So happy with this gesture and ability to make it right without any question. I think this place and its sister spot know how to make things perfect. You can't go wrong here and I'm so happy this is in my neighborhood."
432,nvTE9vtXCoYvF9-l6PZMVw,8/1/2022,5 star rating,"UND might be my new favorite spot on the UES. Martini Mondays, do I need say more. $4 half size martini's and $8 regular martini's. Whether you take yours dry or dirty, with gin or vodka, UND has got you covered.  I came here for dinner with friends and ordered the Garganelli alla Vodka. All of their pasta is freshly made and my dish was absolutely delicious. UND has a great atmosphere and good service.  Open for lunch and dinner, UND is a must try on the UES!"
433,nvTE9vtXCoYvF9-l6PZMVw,1/3/2022,4 star rating,"TLDR; Great vibes, great food. Don't skip dessert.Living in the Upper East Side, I ate at Uva Next Door once a week. It was where I stopped by for dessert for one, brought my date, or introduced to family and friends. To me, Uva captures the quintessential NYC dining experience: an interior design that makes it feel that you've been transported to another place once you're seated at your table; dimly lit, slightly crowded, and a tad loud with wide open windows that bring the city life in; a menu priced just right that you feel like you're treating yourself but will order an appetizer, entree, dessert, and drinks and not feel guilty; attentive waiters who you sometimes wonder if they're putting on an accent when announcing your wine selection; and great food. It's a simple menu with great variety. Every dish I've had from pasta, pizza, to fish has been delicious. My favorites include: the calamari, orecchiette con pesto, and Branzino. Many times I came only for dessert. The milk chocolate polenta budino is a must order again and again and again.Small wine selection, but great pairings. My favorite is their Montepulciano d'Abruzzo offering. They also have a fun cocktail menu, which includes several Negroni variations."
434,nvTE9vtXCoYvF9-l6PZMVw,2/25/2022,5 star rating,Food was great! Definitely enjoyed every bite I've been to the original location UVA so I was prepared to enjoy this sister location. It was def worth the visit and the lamb meatballs for an app was very tasty as well.The only thing that could use work were the drinks. We had the fireside old fashion and the harvest moon both had solid flavors but need better quality alcohol to make it come full circle.

437,nvTE9vtXCoYvF9-l6PZMVw,2/5/2023,4 star rating,Visited late on Sunday night 1/29.  Definitely after 10 pm.   VERY cool place - We had delicious Manhattans & Vespers.   Waiter was tolerant of our nonsense!  Will definitely visit again when next in the neighborhood.
438,nvTE9vtXCoYvF9-l6PZMVw,7/4/2022,4 star rating,"I stumbled upon this place after seeing that Uva was out of reservations. We ordered the octopus, meatballs and tagliatelle.  The octopus was amazing! Super tender and served on a nice mix of root like vegetables, which also contained raisins. The meat ball and pasta were standard. For dessert we had the chocolate cake which was nice and nutty. Drinks were well made and server was super attentive with filling the water!"

We chose 3 different types of tacos: shrimp, fish and pulled pork. Seafood was orange colored and really weird... salty with an odd texture.  My friend's husband liked his pulled pork taco which sported a coleslaw like tipping (we are both allergic, so we didn't get too close.)  He inhaled the nachos, I snagged one or two and they were ok.The juice was super sweet like it'd been sweetened with sugar. Margaritas tasted a little weird and the alcohol content was very low. The three stars are for the friendly employees and great music selection in the outdoor seating area."

A Black-owned taco joint, El Jeffe is worth the hype it gets, but keep your children away -- they blast ratchet music!! My friends and I beat the crowd there thankfully, but it was still shocking how busy it got in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday. I had to shout over the music inside to order, which was fine... but sheesh wouldn't it make sense to turn it down for that? I got the jerk pork tacos and the sangrita. My friends and I waited outside to claim a table, and we didn't even hear when they called us because of the music! But either way, it didn't take long.Those tacos were incredible. The pineapple with the jerk pork was a killer combo. And the refreshing sangrita to wash it all down made it all better. Whenever I return to the city, I'd love to return there and try other things. Just remember, keep your children far away. I feel sorry for the families that casually walk by XD."

Honestly after the two tacos, I could've stopped but it was a long week of teaching so my meal was a marathon and not a sprint. The pulled pork taco was BOMB. Literally my mouth was kind of on fire but the mixture of spices on the pork and the coleslaw were a beautiful combination. Shrimp taco was good but since I got the shrimp burrito too, I wish I would've tried a different taco. I'll be blessing myself with a fried chicken taco next time. The shrimp burrito was delicious. It was packed with flavor and a lot of shrimp! I was prompted to choose fried or grilled for the burrito which I thought was a great touch. I'll definitely be back and will definitely end up eating way more than I should. New year, same me. Eat here. This is a ""me"" question, but I ordered through Yelp, which brought me to grub hub for this restaurant (no other options for online ordering) and I'm wondering if there's a way to make sure the restaurant gets tipped too, as I think my tip went to the deliver person (who was through an external company). I just don't want one to miss out on a tip!"

486,hq_lDiSnheYecX6H0hT7Fg,10/18/2019,1 star rating,"With La Trattoria on Second Avenue, NYC being a block away from the hotel I was staying at during my time in the city - I thought it'd be a good shout to visit to get a pizza, as I hoped to try the authentic pizza experience while in NYC but sadly unless authentic NYC pizza means cheap, tacky and knocking me sick then this for sure isn't that authentic experience. I really wish I'd have checked reviews before visiting this place rather than being excited by their gluten-free pizza sign as I passed!Inside, the place is a little small but there is limited seating - they do deliver on various platforms.I ordered the gluten-free Margherita, the price was a lot higher than expected as they charge a surcharge for gluten-free compared to the menu - one thing which puzzled me was the overhead menu didn't even state pizzas so I had to request a tacky one - come on it's a pizza place,e, why isn't pizza listed on the overhead menus?The staff didn't seem too friendly either - one of the pizza men actually was emptying and sorting out the rubbish bins (ew) while he was preparing my food and waiting for it to cook - which surely isn't good for hygiene.When my pizza was served, it was served in a box in a weird type tray, similar to a pie - I presume that's how they do things in NY and if it stops pizza grease going onto the board, that makes the pizza box recyclable so that's a good thing! I also liked how they gave me a separate gluten-free cutter to minimise cross-contamination.The base was okay at best (again a little bland and uninspiring), it was a little rough and hard around the crust area making it difficult to eat and cut but it was ruined by the poor, low-quality toppings, not only was it overloaded with cheese, it wasn't seasoned and just didn't taste fresh nor authentic of a pizza experience which one would surely expect from the price.To make matters worse, a couple of hours after eating (I could only stomach half the pizza as I would give the taste 2/5 anyway), I began to feel rather ill, which makes me think there was a chance of cross-contamination or perhaps other methods here (such as cleaning the bins while making food) could have had an affect.Bad pizza which made me feel ill which had a negative knock-on effect on my trip to New York makes this the first place I visited in NYC to deserve a place on my ""Avoid at all costs"" list from bad service to hygiene practices and mediocre, bland, unseasoned food with bad quality toppings which even make Domino's look gourmet La Trattoria is surely a disgrace to NY eateries to warrant a one-star rating."
487,hq_lDiSnheYecX6H0hT7Fg,1/3/2021,4 star rating,This place is down the block from me and I come here at least 2-3 times a week! Staff is so so friendly. They have a decent variety of pizzas. I always get the garlic knots as a side and they're delicious and come with marinara sauce (although I I think they actually taste better on their own)

489,hq_lDiSnheYecX6H0hT7Fg,2/27/2021,5 star rating,"The pizza made by Jaime is the BEST pizza I have eaten in New York and the whole country! I come to La Trattoria every Friday night to order my favorite pizza Margarita made by Jaime, and it always meets and even exceeds my expectations. Its dough gives a soft crust, tomatoes are fresh and juicy, and cheese has a delicate and tender texture, bringing a magically delicious taste with a great flavor of aromatic basil. Jaime is not only a talented cook but also a nice and friendly person. He always meets clients with a smile, treats them with respect, and delivers orders efficiently and with care. No wonder why Jaime's highly professional attitude creates loyalty among customers like me and motivates me to come back every time for his amazing pizza! I strongly recommend Jaime as a wonderful cook and can even nominate his pizza as the best pizza in town! La Trattoria is very fortunate to have him!"

The pizza slices are definitely a lot cheesier, hotter and tastier sauce than at least 3 other locations that I have tried in the area so far. Came here for the first time in person yesterday, and the pizza was just as good. Might not have the best inside area but that's what you get- no fuss, quick and easy and delicious."

It's pretty affordable to my surprise because of the prices in the city. The staff was friendly. The place is spacious. The food is alright. I tried the BBQ pizza, sausage rolll and Danny's pizza. The food wasn't anything extraordinary. It was all surface flavors as if the sauces didn't marinate the meat enough. I'd still give this place a try I guess. I also had two sodas. Total was about ~$16"

I asked for a ""well done"" pie, and received this bland sauce poor excuse for a pie without it being well done. When I called back the unaffected teen answering the phone gave me an ""um, well the next time you order make sure you explain that your last order wasn't well done."" Thanks kid, but I'm not ordering from pronto anymore. Between the poor pizza and lame antipasto salad I'm sticking with the mom & pop places from now on."

499,tUgaTRrh0fAumEjjcfMYCw,7/9/2018,2 star rating,I've been coming to Prontos for years. I always ordered from the one on forest Ave when I lived on the other side of the island. Today I came to the one on Bay Street with my daughter. She loves pepperoni. We took a walk here because it's not too far away. The young lady at the front taking the orders was very NASTY. I asked for a cup of ice and she acted as if she was doing me a favor. I asked for light sugar on my zeppoles and when I got to it was wrong. When I mentioned it she looked annoyed. My advice to management is teach customer service. Customers come back when they feel valued. Very disappointing.
500,tUgaTRrh0fAumEjjcfMYCw,5/6/2020,2 star rating,"BRING BACK LONI!!Ever since Loni stopped managing the Bay Street location, the quality of food and service has gone in the crapper. I've had drivers deliver my food drunk! What used to be a nice, thick piece of chicken breast is now beaten so thin you can see through it. Why; in the name of profit?I've been their customer for 20 years, and it has never sucked, until Loni left the business! DAN... IF YOU ARE READING THIS, PLEASE REMOVE THE GUY IN CHARGE AND INSTALL LONI BACK TO THIS STORE (if he even still works in the company).  I don't mind paying $20.00 for my food, but I expect it to be worth it!!!"

505,ELCnBV5Ie3VnY2q3842Rbg,2/27/2017,3 star rating,"$13.99 for lunch which ends at 4:00pm (30 min later than other AYCE sushi places in Brooklyn). Price includes a soft drink or hot tea. Ice cream is $2 extra. The selection is decent in terms of variety of rolls and hot food. Generous amount of food and the hot foods are spelled out in terms of how many in an order (spring rolls, or shrimp tempura,etc) which I liked. Sushi rolls are pretty tasty and you have the option of any of rolls to be made into hand rolls. Salmon teriyaki was a bit thin but pretty yummy. We ordered twice and everything was brought out correctly. Decent place for AYCE sushi if you are in the area. (FYI - It is the next day and I did not get sick from their food)"
506,ELCnBV5Ie3VnY2q3842Rbg,10/21/2019,2 star rating,"They charge 4% fee if you pay with card! Wish I was informed beforehand. The $60 meal for dinner was an absolute no. The appetizers are limited compared to other sushi buffets. I really liked the kani salad, but the other appetizers were bland. The sushi itself was of low quality. The sashimi I ordered was super cold and some still had ICE on it. It was still a little frozen.The owner is nice, but there is nothing special about this establishment. It says they offer free ice cream on the menu, but when we asked, they didn't have any. It was raining super hard, and this was the closest place we could find shelter and I am not coming back. $60 for cheap and low quality food, no thankss. They do offer 50% off take out so just order that guys! I don't recommend the AYCE sushi buffet."

508,ELCnBV5Ie3VnY2q3842Rbg,10/17/2020,4 star rating,"Really became my go to sushi place during covid. Their prices are reasonable. If your picky or want high end sushi, maybe not the best place. But if like me just grabbing simple quick sushi, this place I would recommend. Just Don't expect too much and you will be fine. Been coming for years (ups and downs) I accepted them as the go to place to fill my sushi cravings"
509,ELCnBV5Ie3VnY2q3842Rbg,2/25/2018,3 star rating,"At first, didn't really want to come here but the ad for their lunch special that are posted were too good to not try. Boy, I'm glad i came. Their salmon bento box was delicious- salmon were grilled with good crispness and very tasty. I would definitely order the salmon bento box again. I also tried their udon noodle soup which was okay- typical udon soup, nothing that special but for the price of it- why not. BTW, their sushi making isn't all that great- very average. I think I may need to go else where for better sushi."
510,ELCnBV5Ie3VnY2q3842Rbg,3/28/2017,4 star rating,"My boyfriend and I have visited Toyama countless times for lunch and we've never had any major issue with food or service. The food itself isn't the best quality but hey, it's AYCE sushi for such a cheap price, what can you expect? Plus, they have a good variety of appetizers and sushi to choose from (handrolls included). Wait time for food was reasonable and never took overly long. They even serve soda for free during lunch - beware as it may fill you up quickly. If there was a flaw, I guess they might've missed a few of our orders here and there, but it wasn't really an issue since we just reordered more food. Otherwise, I think this place is a great deal. You're bound to leave Toyama full and your sushi cravings satisfied."
511,ELCnBV5Ie3VnY2q3842Rbg,8/13/2015,4 star rating,"I'm not sure what everyone is upset about.The place looks clean, serving is fast.Well, maybe due to the fact that I came on a Wednesday afternoon at 3pm.They were serving the lunch AYCE and I haven't had that in about 2 years, so my stomach didn't feel good with all that good food afterwards.This is one of the 3 places of unlimited sushi as of today.I have yet tried the Daizen and Hangout 58.The lunch is $13.THe staff speaks english, no Wifi though.They have good appetizers and sushi. And free ice cream at the end, which I didn't stick around for because I was in a rush.My favorite is the King Salmon roll, but when the Godzilla roll came, I loved it even more."
512,ELCnBV5Ie3VnY2q3842Rbg,1/4/2015,2 star rating,Only giving two stars because of the okay sashimis they offered. All the rolls we ordered tasted exactly the same. They also forgot two rolls we ordered in the first time! Horrible service and the food took forever around 30 minutes considering there was about 10 people including my group of 3. The appetizers were okay... definitely better than the sushi which doesnt say much.Is it just me or did I see cream cheese in almost all the rolls? Perhaps this is a trick to get us to be filled faster? Wont be coming back

514,jnHbdsqlTKlPcmJ8BCP9-g,1/8/2023,5 star rating,The best and most consistent Italian spot in the city.The grilled artichokes are a must! My favorite pasta dish is the Tagliatelle.
515,jnHbdsqlTKlPcmJ8BCP9-g,1/10/2023,4 star rating,"We sat outside but it was heated and warm enough. Didn't need jackets but kept my sweater on. Got a peak of the inside which was cozy and warm feeling and very busy .Ok so for the food- I felt it was pretty average Italian food. Maybe because it's so hard to get reservation and it's on everyone's list to try, so I had high expectations? I had the tonnarelli and it was just okay. My friend had the tagliatelle pasta and she also felt it was just okay. For starter we had the salad, castelfranco - the hazelnut honey dressing was delicious. Best part was the chocolate mouse dessert, I don't know the name for it as it was a verbal dessert menu.Service was great! Friendly and fast."
516,jnHbdsqlTKlPcmJ8BCP9-g,3/21/2023,5 star rating,Really enjoyed the outside dining with heating and space. Our server Janice and her support Alejandro were so caring and attentive. They were there at the right moments and so professional yet put you at ease at the same time. The food was a star as well with the Cacio Pepe and the grilled sea bream cooked to perfection. I want to take the insalata verde salad dressing home with me. Also the Negroni terra was my favorite of the variations on the menu.
517,jnHbdsqlTKlPcmJ8BCP9-g,1/7/2023,4 star rating,"Via Carota has been on my list for forever, but it's impossible to get reservations. We luckily got off the waitlist on Resy and were able to get a table for 2 at 5:45.Ambiance is great - a cute, bustling Italian restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating. Food was amazing 10/10. We loved our grilled artichokes and cacio e pepe, but the star of the show were the meatballs with pine nuts and raisins. Pretty pricy for 3 meatballs for $28 (feels more like an appetizer to me), but the sauce was phenomenal.Service on the other hand was a bit strange and left a lot to be desired. We didn't order drinks and felt judged for not doing so. We were mostly ignored and rushed. We were in and out of there in around an hour. It felt like they didn't think we were going to get much, so didn't treat us like paying customers. V disappointed, otherwise would have given this place 5/5 stars."
518,jnHbdsqlTKlPcmJ8BCP9-g,11/30/2022,4 star rating,"Before I talk about the food, I have to give props to Vincenzo our server -- we had a reservation for 8:30 pm on a Wednesday and had to wait nearly 40 min for our table. I think we managed to stay pleasant and polite but were clearly a bit at the end of our rope once we sat down. Vincenzo very quietly had a complimentary appetizer sent to us, as well as refilling my husband's (very good) wine twice without charge. All of which was much appreciated and we thought reflected very well on Via Carota's hospitality. That really made our dinner -- so it was truly a bonus that the food was of course very good as well. We had the grilled artichoke, arancini, papardelle w boar ragu, tagliatelle w prosciutto and svizzerina (which was quite accurately described by Vincenzo as ""like a seared steak tartare"") -- the tagliatelle is definitely on the richer/cheesier than expected side (and wish it had a little more prosciutto to balance out said cheesy pasta). Otherwise, highly recommend all.  And aside from the wait, we found the overall atmosphere warm and friendly."
519,jnHbdsqlTKlPcmJ8BCP9-g,2/19/2023,5 star rating,"It's worth the hype. A Negroni that beats out Dante's finest, every dish and drink we had left us impressed. The Negroni bianco is smooth, goes down so easily. How lucky I was to go in a larger group-- we did family style, which gave us the opportunity to sample en masse. Who knew salad, the insalate verde specifically, could be this decadent? The tagliatelle was fantastic, as was the cacio pepe. Same with the svizzeruina! I wasn't as keen on the pappardelle., though, and felt like you can probably get a better espresso martini elsewhere. Still, Via Carota delivers."
520,jnHbdsqlTKlPcmJ8BCP9-g,3/17/2023,5 star rating,"We walked in for a weekday lunch and was able to get seated immediately on the ""communal table' (a long table that can fit 12 but it didn't feel packed). The restaurant was busy for a weekday! The servers were attentive and checked in with us but not to the point that it was over bearing. As for the foodSalad was delicious and tasted super fresh! I would say it is overpriced for what it is though and I don't need to order it again.Cacio pepe was the star of our meal! It was al dente and buttery. Perfect in every way and had the right amount of pepper. Even though the dish appeared small it was filling. Wild boar ragu pappardelle was a bit on the dry side. Wish it had more sauce.Affogato was delicious! Expresso was very fresh and the gelato was delicious!Will definitely be back to try other stuff!"
521,jnHbdsqlTKlPcmJ8BCP9-g,11/21/2022,4 star rating,"It's good..... not wait for hours good though. I know they probably like the long lines infamy but it would be so easy to just say no walk ins and open up actual reservations that people can realistically get (I believe they only have reservations in name only, typically almost all will be gone even weeks ahead and your best bet is to waitlist). The cacio e pepe is good of course, I personally love the dish sizes but a lot of people might find the lack of sides and small potions wanting. Aka my guest with me!"
522,jnHbdsqlTKlPcmJ8BCP9-g,2/14/2023,5 star rating,"This place has been on my radar for the longest time, and considering it is hard to book, I was ready for the challenge to get a reservation. I managed to finally get one, and my friend and I were excited to go since it seemed so popular. We entered the restaurant and were met by a cozy and cute interior, with white table cloths covering every single table. Except ours. Which was a little strange, but my friend and I are not particularly picky, so we didn't ask to switch tables. We were seated and given some time to look over the menus (which are very cutely situated in the back of your seat), and since we looked at other people's reviews beforehand, we were ready to order right away:Drinks:Cynar Spritz and Old Fashioned - the cocktails that I and my friend got, respectively. Both were very solid; I particularly liked mine since I feel it was sweeter than a normal spritz, but if you have ever had an Old Fashioned and like spirit-forward drinks, the Old Fashioned here was very solid.Food:'Nduja Arancini - came first with the other appetizer we ordered (which I will talk about next). Very, very solid arancini. The outside was really nice and crispy with a soft and very savory interior (because of the 'nduja) which I liked quite a bit. A very good start to the meal, though I wouldn't say it broke barriers as far as arancini goes.Carciofi alla griglia (grilled artichokes) - the other appetizer we ordered because it was mentioned time after time after time in other people's reviews, and goodness me, these people were RIGHT. Def some of the best artichokes (if not the best) I've ever had, with a nice citrus and smoky flavor paired with such a smooth, light, but creamy aioli. Absolutely delicious, would definitely get these again if I were to come back!Funghi (mushrooms) - we actually ordered this at the end since we wanted one more savory dish before dessert, but I'll include it here before the entrees since it gives more appetizer vibes. Pretty solid mushrooms, but it really came together once you took a bite with the scarmoza cheese included at the bottom of the dish. Quite tasty, but I wish they included more cheese since it only came with three pieces for so many mushrooms.Tonnarelli (cacio e pepe) - one of three entrees we ordered, and one of their most famous dishes according to other restaurant goers. It was definitely a very good cacio e pepe; really nice sauce with that nice peppery flavor, just what I was expecting. However, that's just the problem imo; it was just as I expected. It was for sure yummy, but I really don't think it blew me away like how I expected it to based on the rave reviews. I would def try it though if you go here and if you like cacio e pepe.Pappardelle (wild boar ragu) - one of the other entrees we ordered and the other pasta of the night, both my friend and I liked this a lot since we both love pappardelle and ragu. Super flavorful with the meaty goodness of a good ragu, and the pasta was cooked perfectly (which I forgot to mention about for the cacio e pepe, since that was perfect too in terms of texture). Probably our personal favorite over the cacio e pepe, but I think we prefer more acidic, meatier sauces anyway.Via Carota Svizzerina - the last of the three entrees we ordered, and probably one of the most unique dishes we have had at an Italian restaurant. It's funny because we both though it looked like a Salisbury steak, but once we took a bite, we both fell in love. The crust from the searing was absolutely AMAZING, while the interior was nice and smooth, characteristic of high quality meat. Honestly one of our favorite dishes of the night; so unique, and probably something I wouldn't be able to get anywhere else (at least from what I've seen).Dessert:Zabaione - one of the desserts we got, and this was super surprising because it was so simple yet SO good. The custard paired so so well with the fresh tartness of the raspberries (which were so good btw). I know it looks and sounds simple, but you won't regret getting it because it was just that good!Semifredo - the other dessert we got; basically a Ferrero Rocher in dessert form! So chocolately and hazelnutty, and packed with real hazelnuts. Def super yummy, but nothing super groundbreaking.Overall: I think it was a very solid meal. Didn't dislike anything, service was pretty good, and interior was very cute. However, for the amount of effort I had to put in to get this reservation, I think it falls just short of me wanting to try again in the near future. If someone were to invite me to go though, I would def consider!"

524,-jdadX3fGXA2TDapnufYFA,2/12/2023,3 star rating,Does not live up to the hype. Would have given it 2 and a half if possible. The calamari was top notch as was the Sfingione which was close to the classic Palermo street food. Was a little disappointed that there were no real anchovy filets on the sfingione and it was anchovy flavored sauce. Also disappointed that the toasted breadcrumbs on top were not authentic ans was Panko.The Mia pizza and hotter than July were disappointing as was the tasteless margerita pizza and mozzarella sticks. Calzone was also bland. None of the dough met expectations either. Prices for what we got were steep With so many other places i will not repeat

I love what they were going for in terms of a focus on a distinctly good pizza by focusing on the dough itself, and following that with quality ingredients on top.The customer service is excellent.

The spicy pepperoni  pie with hot honey is very different and quite tasty if you like heAt. Calamari were delicious and not oily at all. The sausage broccoli rabe egg rolls are different and a nice little treat. Look forward to trying more menu items .

So I ended up making my own ""pizza flight"" and buying a few personal sized ones so my husband and I could sample a few. Pesto and vodka pizzas are winners. The sauce is rich and their namesake dough is tender. Our daughter also thoroughly enjoyed the plain pie. We'll definitely be ordering again."
528,-jdadX3fGXA2TDapnufYFA,11/20/2021,3 star rating,"We made a special trip over to Staten Island to try out this pizza. It was basically an impromptu date night. Ordering online was super simple. The staff was also very friendly when we picked up the pizza. While I parked my car down the road, I think they actually do have a parking lot. For my taste, the crust was a little on the soggy side. And flavors fell a little flat. That said, still had fun consuming more pizza than we should have on a Friday night eating out."
529,-jdadX3fGXA2TDapnufYFA,7/29/2022,5 star rating,"100/10! My all time FAVORITE restaurant! By this point I have probably tried every pizza on the menu and when I tell you I have LOVED every single one! When I first placed an order back in January I was a little skeptical due to the extensive menu; but every single dish is perfection!! I was so excited to hear they've recently expanded to another location and am constantly referring my friends. If I'm ordering pizza, it's coming from DOUGH no questions asked!"
530,-jdadX3fGXA2TDapnufYFA,8/16/2022,3 star rating,"Came for the hyped up pie. It was average. Dry, thin crust round pie with not enough sauce. They put the cheese on the dough first which may be preferred by some, but not I. Calzone was authentic."

Got that done and heard about Dough, saw some beautiful photos from a friend and decided this is where we're going. I called it in, we got a 16"" pie, half with meatball crumbles and red onions. There are clean tables on the outside and nice garden seating in the backyard. It looks to be a small house they turned into a pizzeria, very nice and clean inside. The young lady who took our order is a lovely person, polite and friendly. So the pizza is fantastic! The crust is light and crisp. This was a two slicer for me! I never eat two. Sauce was good not bitter and enough cheese. They also have a menu for sandwiches and more. I can't imagine the food being anything but excellent! We do not live here but it is worth the drive. Nothing like it in my area. Dough is aptly named. The crust is the best! We loved it!"
532,-jdadX3fGXA2TDapnufYFA,6/15/2021,5 star rating,This is by far the best pizza I have had since moving to NY! Finally... a restaurant that has a flavorful sauce! My fav is the grandma pie! We added pepperoni and crumbled sausage! I will not eat pizza unless it's from here.
533,-jdadX3fGXA2TDapnufYFA,6/13/2022,2 star rating,Normally the pizza here is very good. However the last two times my pizzas have arrived like this. It was over 40 minutes late. By the time it got to us it was cold and was hard as a rock. Im so disappointed writing this review. Maybe it was a bad batch ? But still I paid $40 for my order and it normally is not this bad.
534,UPOtComj8_OlNLSmd3zh1w,11/20/2021,5 star rating,"So much fun! Came here with friends on a Thursday night. A good crowd of people but not to the point where we couldn't find a seat. The bartender was nice and attentive the whole time we were there. The security people were nice too. My friends and I had such a blast! There's really never going wrong with arcade and booze. So barcade def hits the spot. Also, you can bring in outside food. Which is great. So my friends and I ordered a full pie to feed our tummies."
535,UPOtComj8_OlNLSmd3zh1w,8/27/2021,3 star rating,"This is the third Barcade location that I have been to. Though it is the original location, I had been to the St. Mark's and Chelsea ones before this one. For me, this one is the worst one of the three. The main negative is unlike the others, they do not serve food here and just offer a few snacks like pretzels and chips.In terms of games, they do have a larger game selection than the St. Mark's location (but smaller than the Chelsea location). I saw a few machines that I did not see at the other locations. These included Captain Commando, Dariusburst, and Rampage."
536,UPOtComj8_OlNLSmd3zh1w,7/15/2021,4 star rating,"Super late Saturday night, one of the few bars still open and with plenty available machines. Got carded at the door and quickly got a drink at the central bar before heading to the games.Beers range between $7-9 mostly at a nice selection as well. As for the games, they run mostly on 1-2 tokens each, with each token being $0.25.Some Pros:-Good selection of classics such as NBA Jam, Frogger, Tetris, Mortal Kombat-Small stands or cupholders between consoles in order to place drinks without spilling.Cons:-Since the space isn't too big, there aren't as many driving games or larger format games to try out. -Didn't see much or any cleaning of machines between use, so be warned if adverse during this timeA good standby for something to do while sipping on a drink late at night."
537,UPOtComj8_OlNLSmd3zh1w,2/2/2023,5 star rating,I've been coming to this place for 3 going on 4 years. I love the games and the staff. It's honestly the best bar in New York. I try to come here every weekend in the summer always wearing the PAC MAN hoodie I have. A+ Love every minute I go.
538,UPOtComj8_OlNLSmd3zh1w,2/4/2023,1 star rating,Cool place but you can't drink here. They don't wash their glasses.  They dip them all in the same dirty sink full of water and then reuse. So disgusting.
539,UPOtComj8_OlNLSmd3zh1w,8/26/2022,5 star rating,"One of my favorite bars in Brooklyn.Came here on a Saturday night with friends and we had a ball. A wide variety of games as well as drinks. A huge recommendation to pregame with friends (a good meetup spot) or date spot. As for the drinks they average cost is from $7-10 which isn't bad for New York City, and a wide selection of games."
540,UPOtComj8_OlNLSmd3zh1w,6/22/2021,4 star rating,"Yes, yes your inner 12 year old is in love with this place.  Its rows filled with old school arcade games that make you talk to yourself in public. Loudly. I see you gods of Centipede.... I see you."
541,UPOtComj8_OlNLSmd3zh1w,10/17/2022,4 star rating,"Been here countless times over the past 15 years.  Beer selection here is delightfully retro, and many of the drafts are of the type you use to find way back when but hardly see anymore - Abita, Harpoon, Troegs, Victory, Stone, etc.  Don't know any of the current staff, but old staff was fantastic.  I'd give it 5 stars, but don't care for the crowd during most times of the week."
542,UPOtComj8_OlNLSmd3zh1w,2/22/2022,5 star rating,"This place is just fun all around! Loved it. They had so many games from the past I literally felt like a kid who was allowed to drink because my parents were away for the weekend! That pretty much sums up the joy I felt while being here and beating my hubby's behind in quite a few games. The bartender we had was awesome, super friendly and very attentive; I wish I would've gotten her name, but she was the bomb. Definitely looking forward to stopping by again for another few rounds of street fighter!"
543,UPOtComj8_OlNLSmd3zh1w,6/5/2021,4 star rating,"A bar with retro arcade games! Its a nice spacious bar filled with games lined up against the walls. The bartenders were nice and never made us wait long even when it was busy. When you enter, you will be required to scan your ID and they will proceed to ask if you are vaccinated. Not sure if they only allow vaccinated people to enter, but be prepared that no one will be wearing their face mask in this establishment (except for employees and customers who wishes to keep their face masks on). Even though everyone had their face masks off, the doors were kept open for ventilation. Games were really cheap, (1-2 tokens per game), and the bartenders are really generous with the alcohol ratio within each drink. I would definitely come back!"

I have to force myself to eat as much as I can since there are starving people out there and i do not like to waste food and money. The food is extremely, wait, i meant EXTREMELY, OVERLY, POWERFULLY salty! Like eating a whole bowl of salt and i would have to force myself to drink as much water as i can to the point where I need to throw up and cant even sit or lay down comfortably. GROSS! I even ordered extra meat for 3.95 and did not even get ""extra"" meat. I got extra salt! $3.95 for additional salt!! The last time i ordered will actually be the last. Will never resort to qdoba. Will go out of my way and drive to chipotle."

546,mU2qDGsY9hf02Fjb7uQBdA,7/15/2017,5 star rating,"Such a great addition to the Woodrow Plaza. The restaurant itself has a city vibe with hightop tables and outdoor seating as well! Staff is friendly and welcoming. Parking can be tricky with only a few spots to share with the other stores in the plaza.Regarding the food- I like the option of the three tacos because you can choose a different protein in each one and you're not limited to one. They now have a new addition to there menu and that's shrimp! My boyfriend always gets the burritos which are flavorful and fresh. I enjoy the bowls and salads with the cilantro lime dressing. This restaurant functions by an assembly line which adds the meat, beans and so on working the way down to the dressings. They also have beers and margaritas which differ them from other places. BEST THING YET IS GUAC AND QUESO AT NO EXTRA CHARGE :))))"
547,mU2qDGsY9hf02Fjb7uQBdA,8/12/2021,1 star rating,"Was in the mood for Mexican takeout food. Usually, when that mood strikes, I'll go to a real and authentic Mexican restaurant. However, it was past 8 at night, and I didn't feel like making a drive out to my usual spot, so I settled on QDOBA. What a mistake. One of the biggest mistakes I made in my life. First off, everyone inside the store was grumpy and miserable. Then, I take the food home, and was severely disappointed. I got a pulled pork quesadilla and nachos with queso sauce. The quesadilla was horribly burnt and it had a strong smell. The meat inside tasted like rubber and globs of fat. No real flavor whatsoever. The nachos were bland, and the queso sauce tasted like microwaved glue. After two bites of the quesadilla I just threw it out. I want a refund! Not sure if all QDOBA joints are like this, but I'll stick to other burrito places when I'm in the mood again."
548,mU2qDGsY9hf02Fjb7uQBdA,1/3/2021,5 star rating,"I love the food! They always get my order right and rarely have minor complaints. And the timing is less than five minutes. So if you are looking for a quick Mexican dinner, definitely order Qboda! Also, the chips and queso their are in my opinion, some of the best chips and queso I have ever had!"

550,mU2qDGsY9hf02Fjb7uQBdA,1/17/2020,1 star rating,"I'm going to preface this entire review by saying I absolutely love Qdoba. My favorite place to get food. But holy mother of god, tonight I have never been treated more like a piece of trash. Specifically by one specific staff member. The disgusting attitude, rolling of the eyes, the uncalled-for comments, and gross looks. Never in my life have I have ever dealt with such horrific service. I can promise you this. I will NEVER go to this location ever again. I hope no one does. The staff are abhorrent and the level of carelessness is mind boggling how they are still employed."
551,mU2qDGsY9hf02Fjb7uQBdA,1/9/2018,5 star rating,"I hadn't ever tried a kids meal here, but it was a nice, light snack that I could go for again. My server was on her game working multiple orders at once like she was in the zone. The aesthetic of this particular franchise is nicer than the one on Page Ave."
552,mU2qDGsY9hf02Fjb7uQBdA,8/11/2019,1 star rating,"It took me 30 minutes to get my food after i ordered online. Upon asking, they said my order was being made, but it was not. People that arrived after me got their order way before me. I continued to ask them after 10 more minutes passed, and they still told me it was being made, when it clearly was not, considering the people that had just arrived had already paid and gotten their food. They consistently told me it would be five more minutes until my food was ready. As it turns out, my food was already ready. I had given the cashier my name multiple times, and even spelled it out for him each time, and it had been at the front counter the entire time. I had even asked him if that was my order to which he replied no. Upon receiving my order, i saw that my name was on the receipt on top of the food the whole time. The food is subpar. My food is soggy and my taco shell has become limp. I ordered chips and queso, and they gave me enough chips for about 1/4 of the queso cup.I will never return to this location ever again because of the sheer incompetence of the workers and their ability to cope with basic tasks."
553,mU2qDGsY9hf02Fjb7uQBdA,2/20/2018,5 star rating,"I find that if I eat at corporate / franchise restaurants with very low expectations, I can sometimes be pleasantly surprised. In this case, I was just that: pleasantly surprised. The ingredients tasted fresh and the meals were flavorful. I was content and my kids were happy. The kid's meal serves its purpose with one taco, a drink, and chips. Perfect for the kiddos. I tried a few different tacos but the vegetarian one was the standout for me. Give it a try. Staff is also pleasant and helpful. It's hard not to eat here and wish it was a Chipotle instead but it's good to know we're finally getting some variety in Woodrow Plaza. We have enough pizzerias and Chinese food restaurants. Time to try something else."
554,AqQkBsacSsKjN2FdPeBkmg,8/22/2019,3 star rating,The Chinese food was just ok. The place is under renovation so excuse the 3 stars for mainly that reason. The egg rolls were actually impressive. I haven't has  a good egg roll in years there alway half soft and no crisp. This egg roll was the bomb crispy as hell and tasteful.  Food I recommend if your in the area and crave Chinese.
555,AqQkBsacSsKjN2FdPeBkmg,5/6/2020,1 star rating,"Ordered right after they opened after covid, told to pick up in 30 minutes. When we arrived we were yelled at and told to wait for a text because "" we are very busy"". Imagine having a community swamp you with support in dark times, and they are yelling at customers... unreal. Talk about ungrateful and absolute garbage customer service."
556,AqQkBsacSsKjN2FdPeBkmg,10/26/2017,4 star rating,This is my favorite Chinese spot in Rockaway. Food is amazing. Only Chinese place I've ever had where you don't feel sick to your stomach after. I gave 4 stars because the phone lines are always busy and delivery can be over an hour wait. I love their food and completely understand why they are so busy but they need more staff.
557,AqQkBsacSsKjN2FdPeBkmg,2/18/2018,3 star rating,"Me, my beau and his mother ordered takeout while it was snowing pretty badly. Food was delivered in about 40 minutes, which is not bad at all because of the snow. We got the food and we were missing a dish. Tried calling them at 10pm but they did not answer (they close at 10:30pm). I can't blame for not answering! It was really bad weather and from what the delivery boy said it was a struggle for him to deliver! I ordered the shrimp chow fun, ribs combination plate and shrimp lo mein. Missing the Mongolian beef which my beau was looking forward to eat. The food was ok, but I have to say I'm a fan of their wonton soup! Next day we called them and they said to come over to get money back for the missing dish. Went over there with the menu and the receipt and they figured out how the order didn't go through. They were apologetic and gave the cash back. I am happy that they were understanding and admitted to their error. My best advice to everyone ordering here if you order takeout please check to make sure all your food is in the delivery!"
558,AqQkBsacSsKjN2FdPeBkmg,7/27/2019,3 star rating,The food was not very good.  The ribs were burnt to a crisp as if they were left over from yesterday and recooked today.  Not very appealing to eat ended up throwing them out.  The spring rolls were ok but a bit oily.  I also had orange chicken.  The only thing cooked right was the broccoli.  The chicken was not very good.  Overall the items ordered were not outstanding barely passable.  I was very disappointed.  The quality of the food seems to be hit or miss.  Sometimes it is excellent and other times not very good at all not even visually appealing.  They need better consistency.  Usually I would have given them 5 stars in the past but this order was barely 3 stars.
559,AqQkBsacSsKjN2FdPeBkmg,3/29/2018,2 star rating,"The place seems upscale but only in prices. A ""fair"" amount of food for the family at higher price than a your average nearby Chinese food locations. They are kind to customers, if you do not complain about their service. More than an hour on delivery on different occasions without fail. My fourth and final time ordering."
560,AqQkBsacSsKjN2FdPeBkmg,12/7/2016,1 star rating,"The food is mediocre at best. The delivery service is horrendous. Its a minimum 1 hour, which is unreasonable. An hour for Chicken Lo Mein is ridiculous. And getting the order right is half the battle! How hard is it to mark off my order as I give it to you? How hard is it to place that menu/order on the right bag? And then to just guess what I ordered, TWICE is no bueno. I'm a huge fan of supporting local business, but when that business doesn't give a shit about you, they lose my money. They're the only game west of 116, an they know anyone west of 116, will order from them, so they don't care if your order is right or if takes them an hour and a half to deliver. Thats what happens when a restaurant gets complacent and takes us for granted. I'll drive to Brooklyn before I give them another nickel of my hard earned money. Adios!!!"
561,AqQkBsacSsKjN2FdPeBkmg,7/13/2016,1 star rating,Descent Chinese food. Hit or miss but the girl who answers the phone and takes your order is rude as hell. Makes you not even want to complete your order. If there was more of selection in the area I would never order from here just because of her. They need to seriously keep her off answering the phones and away from the customers. Horrible service
562,AqQkBsacSsKjN2FdPeBkmg,7/23/2013,1 star rating,"I tried calling ""East Meets West"" on 129th Street to order food on the relay services (since I'm profoundly deaf and can't hear well on the phone). The first try I got hung up on and the guy said 'Sorry, I'm too busy'. I get that you're busy dude..... but when I try a second time and I get 'Oh my god you're killing me, bye' and then hung up on again..... well you just deserved a rant for all to see. Once I told my sister what happened she called them to complain.  The guy who hung up on me was an obnoxious jerk who at first tried to play dumb, and then asked to see the transcript (of which I'm more than happy to show them).  When my sister asked to speak with the manager he took her phone number saying he wasn't there at the moment, and that he'd have him call her back.The manager called her back about three minutes later (obviously indicating the manager wasn't really missing) and did apologize, but then proceeded to defend the kid for what he did saying ""He's young and inexperienced. I'll talk to him.  What do you want me to do?""  My sister said we both would never order from them again, and the manager just said 'Fine' like he couldn't care less.I think it's disgraceful that not only was I discriminated against for using an alternate mode of communication, but then I was pushed aside like just another customer that means nothing to them.  I have frequented this place for a number of years as their food is better than most of the Chinese places around the area.  Granted, I understand it's not a quick phone call for a delivery order, but seriously - an extra 30-45 seconds wouldn't kill you.Their food is good, but their customer services leaves a hell of a lot to be desired.  Hearing impaired people deserve the right to order by phone too!!!!"

I felt so bad I told my dad to give it another try and after a hard day of work instead of a good hot meal, his pork frie rice was raw grainy hard no flavor and boneless spare ribs dry no sauce hard dry meat. The egg rolls my poor kids love egg rolls and these were still so disgusting! Back to searching for Chinese in Rockaway Beach."

It didn't take long to come out, but they felt they had to give me updates. And when the food did come, they apologized for the wait, when they did not have to. Also, they didn't charge for the empanada. The food was great! The empanada was amazing! There was a sweet sauce inside that added a great flavor. I have had lomito saltado before, and this one was just as good, maybe better, than others I've had. The sauce was great, the fries and meat had great seasoning.

This is a great local place.For those who don't know, Cypress Hills has a large Latin American population. Historically, it was only Puerto Rican and Dominican, but now there is a sizeable pan-Latin American population.I have passed this restaurant so many times and always wanted to try it. I'm glad I finally had impetus to walk in! The interior is very homely. It's not a big space, but it's large enough for what it is. I love the pictures they have up, especially of the soccer teams. When I see that, it seems they are connected with the community, which is always a great sign.I ordered a meat empanada and the lomito saltado for takeout. I ordered the food to go. Like many Spanish restaurants in the area, they have a canteen setup, but since I ordered off the menu, the lomito saltado had to be prepared. The waiters made my wait very pleasant. It didn't take long to come out, but they felt they had to give me updates. And when the food did come, they apologized for the wait, when they did not have to. Also, they didn't charge for the empanada. The food was great! The empanada was amazing! There was a sweet sauce inside that added a great flavor. I have had lomito saltado before, and this one was just as good, maybe better, than others I've had. The sauce was great, the fries and meat had great seasoning. The meat was a little tough, but that's probably my fault as I didn't eat it right away when I got home.Overall, this a great little, locally owned restaurant in Cypress Hills. I will be going again, possibly try their breakfast menu."

I got the carne with beans and rice. The meat was flavorful, lots of rice and a few papas fritas, also some red onion thrown in the mix on top. The beans were super soupy which I love. The service was friendly and the food was fresh. A good portion, definitely enough for leftovers for $8. Their tamales looked great, next time I will try those for sure."

My hubby and I visited NYC for 3 days and were deciding btw the St. Regis and The Whitby, we decided on the The Whitby and I am so happy we did! The hotel is tucked away on 56th street right off of 5th avenue. When we walked into the hotel the staff greeted us each time with such warmth. Each time we would leave and return they would talk with us and were so nice. The hotel main areas are beautifully decorated and CLEAN! Now on to our room...OMG! I seriously was like screaming inside when I walked into the room. It was a junior suite. Breathtaking views. Living room, bedroom had floor to ceiling windows. Impeccably clean! Full walk-in closet. The bathroom had heated floors, beautiful bathtub, personal tv, soft lighting. Everything about this hotel was fantasy and magical. This will be my only choice when I visit NYC!!!!"

THE SERVICE:  Everyone we encountered was accommodating and kind.  When our Uber couldn't access the road to the hotel on NYE the staff helped him navigate.  The staff in the restaurant was courteous and they seems invested in making sure our service was excellent.THE RESTARANT: we had dinner on NYE here as well as breakfast the next day.  The food was delish.  I had rack of lamb, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts.  The food was well prepared and very tastey.*overall we hadn't heard of this hotel and neither had most of our Uber drivers but it was an excellent stay.  We have stayed at some of the best...the ritz, four seasons, peninsula etc...this was one of our best stays.  We will def return!!!"

It was exquisite! Each bite was creative, beyond delicious and so healthy. There were gluten free scones with cashew cream and sugar-free raspberry jelly, ""tuna"" sandwich (so yum), avocado and sundried tomato on house-made seed bread and four delicious sweets. One of the most thoughtful whole plant options in the entire city. Wow! A total surprise! (And so filling I left with a doggy bag.)"

I didn't even see that my dollar was taped looking, I just took the money out of my pocket and handed her my form of payment. She started shaking her head and gave back my bill saying she could not take it because it was ""taped"" . Honestly I could not believe what I was hearing. I said ""what's wrong with it?"" A bill keeps its value even if it's missing 30% of the physical appearance. She kept on rejecting it until I said that that was all I had, indeed it was. Because of this incident and because maybe she can't control her PMS and took it out on me, I won't go back. I always like to contribute to the local shops but this time I rather go to dunkins which is closed by, than get yelled at too early in the morning. 3 years being being a customer and they lost me over a dollar bill that they could easily take."

598,uZ6nRdD3_XX51vu3ihYyzw,1/28/2020,2 star rating,"I've been going to this restaurant for 2 years on and off as it is the cheapest restaurant by my job. At first I liked the prices and all I would order was turkey burgers to be on the safe side. (after all, how can you mess up a Turkey burger?)As time went on I started to explore other things on the menu. As I did I started to notice my orders coming back wrong.Seems like the best orders to make are orders in person or over the phone and pick up the items rather then delivery.  (check your items before you leave)I always got my turkey burgers the same way over cooked, Onions fried, pickles, lettuce, Ketchup and on a toasted wheat bagel.Orders started to come back, no onions, on a bun instead of wheat bagel, not well done, sometimes no lettuce, no ketchup...I ordered other things...and they got messed up as well....I thought I was safe by ordering a tuna salad with lettuce and onions chopped into the tuna on a toasted wheat bagel...Nope they messed that up too...I'd call them to let them know when I got to work or if I got it delivered.But only rectification was to send it back, I've heard horrible stories about food getting sent back and returning, and at that point I'm hungry, only way I'm sending this back is if it wasn't edible. The best thing about them is their delivery is fast and polite, wish I could say the same about the person taking my orders or the ppl they blame on the phone taking the orders in the kitchen.oh yeah...coffee is meh, the newsstand by the 36th street train station is much better and cheaper and that's the only place in the area to get pizza...the pizza is a good price but tastes mehh..."

The menu is deep: Tex-Mex, Italian, and Greek entrees, breakfast, salads, sandwiches and burgers, and they sometimes have some off-menu gems like tamales and thanksgiving stuffing. The salsas are great; I ask for them with pretty much everything I order. You can usually get a table on the weekend.Pro Tip: Order ahead if you're doing takeout. It can get chaotic at the counter and you'll be waiting for a while if you don't. Also, I don't know if I'd order pizza here, it seems like an afterthought, or maybe a vestige of a time when they did more pizza business."

The wait service also wasn't as intrusive this time around. We ordered seafood pancake, marinated kalbi, rice cake soup and naengmyeon. The dishes were all tasty, I especially enjoyed the rice cake soup. They give many different appetizers which included steamed egg, a soup, and soy sauce based raw crab amongst others. Love eating Korean in Queens, so much better than any place in Long Island where they nickel and dime you for the things we just expect as a ""service""."
601,f5LgJ9TOZis-cQHAND97nA,8/20/2022,5 star rating,"Bi Won be the one, as in the one Korean restaurant we will be recommending going forward because they are currently the best overall across the board. Their kalbi (Korean BBQ) is really good but so are others, but what makes this place the best is that their other dishes are also very good and they also give a good assortment of side dishes (banchan). We started with seafood pancake (haemul pajeon), which was very good. For some reasons, a lot of places make this dish too doughy and skimp on the seafood and vegetables. No such complaints here. In addition to kalbi, we ordered naengmyun, and tteokguk. The naengmyun may have been the weakest alright still pretty good. The tteokguk was very good. Their banchan included steamed egg and raw crabs. The crabs are not as spicy as at BCD but my wife enjoyed them more (I do not like raw crabs). We will be going back to try their other dishes, hopefully very soon."

They have been pretty consistent in quality, but recently have noticed a decrease in quantity to price ratio. They still provide lots of quality side dishes, but the cuts of meat have definitely shrunk. Everything always tastes good though! Personal favorites include the Marinated Beef Short Rib, Pork Belly, and Thinly Sliced Duck (recently discovered this gem). Probably gonna look into other options for kbbq now, but might return in the distant future, for old times sake if anything"

No one cares if it's an entree- you get a boatload of free appetizers, in very small plates, with no names or explanations but one of them will always be marinated anchovies and another fresh homemade Kim Chi. The mandu (meat dumplings) are AMAZING! The Bibimbap was standard which means good and very reasonably priced considering if you can finish everything, you'll not need to eat again for the week. Seafood pancake again, delish with the perfect accompanying sauce. Will definitely go again- can't wait to try the barbecue!!!"

This is the first restaurant I've ordered those dishes for pickup and had them pack up the soup in with the noodles (usually restaurants will package the broth and/or the sauce separately so that the noodles don't get soggy). By the time we got back to the office and opened up the bag, the noodles had soaked up most of the broth and sauce and had become mush. The time elapsed was approximately 25 minutes, which isn't ideal for nengmyun, to be fair - but it was definitely exacerbated by the fact that the noodles were sitting in the broth. If you want to try these dishes here, I would definitely recommend eating in.The sauce for the bibimnengmyun was pretty good, but I didn't personally like the flavor of the broth with the mulnengmyun."

Cooked to perfection,  better then if we did it ourselves. It takes away a little bit of the experience but it was too cold to cook your own food outside anyways. The seafood pancake was also one of the crunchiest and thickest out of any I had. Highly recommend coming and having a nice dinner outside with your family.

I cannot even recall how many times my coworkers and I have had call and dispute our orders because one or everything about the order is wrong. Literally they must spend thousands just replacing and re-delivering food to their customers...they definitely need to change their name because they are anything but reliable.

FYI- It is Korean run if that means anything to you. $6.49/lb gets you buffet food choices that range from spaghetti and meatballs, fried chicken and collards, sushi and imitation shrimp to traditional salad bar fare. The silver lining, if any, were the veggies. They weren't overcooked, which is a rarity at any take out place. I would refrain from everything else though. I doubt I will give this place another chance, despite the lucrative $5-$6.50 sammich specials. Those budget conscious will swoon over the decent prices, but for me this was one of those meals I was dying to put behind me. A distant memory it shall be.

You are going to question it waiting in line but just wait till you eat the food it's incredible. The workers work so hard back there to prepare everything and didn't mess up a single thing in entire order. everything perfect. They also sell beer me and my friend bought 6 beers to chill on while waiting for concert to start across the street. Also the prices are cheaper than your average Chipotle prices and you get way more food here!!! He gave THREE scoops of steak in my burrito and folded it into perfection!  a steak burrito was only $12!!!!!!These workers worked so hard they deserved a nice tip! You won't find these prices anywhere else in NYC I highly recommend for a quick bite while walking around the area!! LUCHADORES is great.

I had the grilled chicken nachos with red beans, pico de Gallo, cheese and spicy sauce. It was fresh, delicious and tasty. It very fulfilling and worth every penny.

We tried to get a table inside but they told us our party was too large and they were at capacity and would seat us once they had 6-7 people leave. 3 people were leaving as we were asking for a table so we decide to stay and wait for another party to leave so we can sit inside and they told us we were on the waitlist. We saw multiple party's get seated while we sat outside even though they came in after us. Our waiter didn't even check on us and basically forgot we were outside. If your party isn't majority white don't bother coming here

It's generally fine, convenient, and a good whiskey selection, though I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.Tonight I was pretty horrified as I walked by though, and saw that while we're in the midst of and most crucial week of a global pandemic with social distancing and quarantine being urged, and restaurant/bars allowed to operate only at 50 percent capacity, this place was full to the brim with throngs of people totally smushed together on the dance floor and bar. This was definitely not 50 percent capacity.I know businesses are struggling right now, and my industry is suffering as well--I've lost almost all my work this month so I get it. But this is completely irresponsible and stupid in the face of what is going on right now. They should be shut down for allowing it to be this crowded. Putting people at risk is not worth squeezing some money out in this period. They also have some health violations on Yelp so I guess it's not shocking that they don't care! Shame on the owners/management/whatever."

My Scottish friend and I basically seen the word Craic and decided it was time for some and a beer. The vibe is chill and I liked the decor, fancy sofas, a nice fireplace, open concept and a long bar. It was really quiet when we went in and sat at the bar. We had good chat with the Irish bartender after I made my friend ask him what the craic was (my humor is shite but we both laughed).Decent variety of beer available and a good pitstop for us."

Yea, yea, I know, other countries make single malts. Not like Scotland my friend.Settled in with a friend for a nice pre-dinner malt + beer on tap (two Scottish beers I'd never tried) including an Isle of Skye beer and another, Innis & Gunn, a sweet malty beer that was quite to my liking and pair nice with a 10 year. Bruichladdich. My friend had the Aberlour a'Bunadh. Two malts as different as can be yet both delightful.Dark space, nice bartender, sparse crowd for a Wednesday evening. A solo guitar player that was actually pretty decent fired up about the time we departed. Finger sandwiches came out about the time he started playing. Cucumber and cheese--well, knock us out! Weeeeee. Heh.Nice space. No pretense, relaxed, easy-going. If I lived in the area I'd clearly be a regular. Scotland's single malt whisky. Have it sparingly in small doses. It's a good thing."

All week waiting for my cheat day to have my bandeja paisa with my Colombian rice con carne molida and I got Chinese rice with something that looked like meat. Before I left the bad review I called them to see if they would make it right. And the cara de chimba manager said there is a new law limiting how much seasoning and sodium could be used in food. This place has done a 180 in the past years. Service is terrible, food is gross and waitresses are deformed. This is not a good representation of Colombian dining. FYI, I noticed a few people say that they are racist and get treated poorly if you aren'tColombian. That's not true, they treat us like shit too."

Huge portions for the price, so make sure you come with an empty stomach...our meals were well made and seasoned. Plenty of Colombian locals were eating there...loved the lively diner vibe during lunch! I tried the Super Bandeja - it's a big platter with rice, fried pork, grounded meat, chorizo, egg, plantain, arepa, and avocado. I sampled my friend's dish - the Chicken Churrasco. It was grilled chicken with salad (tasted kinda like cole slaw), fried cassava, and rice. Pros: 24/7, friendly and attentive waiters in cute outfits! Great bang for the buck for big platters of meaty dishes."

My three stars were  for two of the comedians that I thought were pretty damn funny. It was free so something to do on a humid summer Monday night. The bartender was just kind of checked out. Not many people there and had to stand at the bar for like 5 minutes literally before he came over. When he finally did, he wasn't very accommodating. Asked him for a beer that was light, something that reflected summer. He kinda gave me en empty stare and was dazed for a few. It seemed as if  I asked him a trivia question. We took what he brought us. I knew that I wasn't ordering any more drinks after that and just shuffled in to see the show."

But the place is pretty small and people kept bumping into each other even though there was space to move It looks kind of like a room with a bar. It doesn't have a bar feeling to it There was was a DJ which is always a plus, but the music was whatever.. maybe it was themed that night but it was a weird type of dance music that was very loud Also its cash only and the location kinda sucks Bar service was fast and I paid $8 for a beer for price reference"

The waiting to get in is never longer than 5 mins. and although the bar may seem too crowded to dive into I would suggest making one big drink order if you're with a group. Destiny was an awesome bartender also , she remembered my drink orders after the first round and I can always appreciate that. The backyard is super convenient if you are a fellow smoker, however make sure you close it when you leave or go in winter, nobody wants to dance in the cold.

Just a debrief of the dance floor:1) NYC = city with huge population but tiny, tiny burrows. Friends and Lovers = dance venue with a ton of people packing it in (so hot and steamy) but tiny, tiny space for movement and two bathrooms, each with lines as long as the line of people waiting to get into the venue.2) Clubs/dance venues = hard AF to get the bartenders attention because there are so many people that need to get their drank on. Friends and Lovers = hard AF to get the bartenders attention because there's a ton of people that have nowhere else to stand after getting a drink3) DJs = are they really playing this? Friends and Lovers = are they still playing this?Not my top choice for a Friday night, but college kids, keep em coming! Got to say that the drinks were great and reasonably priced, but it was too much to try to fight my way back for another."

This bar is the perfect event space with the fun bar popping up front and then a door that closes off an open area with a stage and few seating. I would definitely recommend getting there early to snag a seat or you'll be cramped with the 100 other guests trying to see the stage. You would think they'd have a limit to how many people can fit in that space, and forget about trying to get another drink during the show! It's impossible to move through the sea of people to get to the bar.All that to say I was one of the lucky few who had a seat and thoroughly enjoyed the show! The bar is spacious out front as well and had decent prices on drinks. I stuck to wells but I hear they had a good selection of beers as well.

I left around 12:30 and there were at least twice as many people there as when I arrived at 10:30.Be prepared to dance! The music was great the whole time.

The ambiance is warm and cozy with the wood fire oven burning in the back of the room. They started with the complimentary homemade focaccia and it was to die die dipped in their homemade chili infused olive oil. We ordered a pizza and pasta to share. The carbonara was out of this world and I savored every bite. The pizza was also phenomenal with yet again the chili olive oil drizzled on top. The service was also incredible! The manager Eddie, came over several times to explain dishes and was so friendly. It's a breath of fresh air to find someone so passionate about his work. He even surprised us with complimentary homemade tiramisu which my fiancé was raving over even though he swears he doesn't even like tiramisu. 10/10!!!"

The food seemed tasty but it's hard to tell eating with my fingers. The chocolate soufflé had fallen on its side and half the chocolate goop had oozed out of its container too. Bad part about GrubHub and the like is you tip before the service is provided. This did not deserve a tip.

I got the original broth which was pretty good and my friend got the tomato broth. We were quite full after, so I now wish I got the shanghai wheat noodle instead (i like wheat noodles more but was swayed against getting it because the free refills only applies to rice noodle, not shanghai noodle. Little did i know how full i would be off one bowl though...). Overall, i enjoyed the meal and although wouldn't go back again because i can make rice noodles myself, it was fun to try"

The food is also delicious and the service is pretty good. Always happy with the food. The service is pretty good. They don't hover over you and to get there attention you just raise your hand. When they are not busy the serve is on his phone and not looking around much, so you might have to go up to his to ask him for what you need but that isn't a big deal. ANoodles are always delicious. They also serve unlimited noodle refills for eating in. It will cost $1 per additional noodle serving if you want to take the food to go. They also have crawfish that I didn't really like, but the star here is the noodle soup, so I'll just continue getting the noodle soup, forget the crawfish.Tl;dr - delicious noodle soup, can add on stuff and choose what you'd like in it, super cozy on a cold day"

Oh my goodness - i could drink the almond milk tea forever. It's so smooth and wasn't overly sweet. Their process also made sure that there wasn't any weird residue left behind. i was so impressed - i can't wait to go back and try more flavors. It was also good to notice lots of patrons near the shop enjoying their teas. Clearly ViVi Bubble Tea is a welcome addition to this neighborhood.Minus one star: The shop could benefit from better customer service. The girl who took my order was very indifferent and seemed like she couldn't be bothered - no pleasantries or politeness, and she brusquely handed me back my card and receipt. Not a good look in an otherwise pleasant setting. Overall though, lovely shop with great tea."

Would definitely go here again if I'm sick of halal and fried chicken wings. The Ramen noodles were soft and tasty, the popcorn chicken was seasoned well, and the bubble tea was nice and sweet."

689,L5dPewlTmV-FntJdJ71m1g,2/1/2018,5 star rating,"This is going to be a huuuuuuge money sucker. After Yogurtland closed down, hubby and I haven't quite found a good place to go to for a close after dinner snack. Sedduto is good but a little too far (7 blocks) and I don't always feel like ice cream especially in the dead of winter. Kung Fu is good but still a little far (we are lazy! haha). Vivi is the perfect addition now. The drinks are a little sweeter than other places; 50% sugar is too much, so try 30% to get to a level that tastes like 50% at other places. There are so many different types of drinks to try; so far, I have tried the milk tea with bubbles (cold), matcha tea with red beans (cold), kumquat tea with basil seeds (cold) and Logan honey tea (hot). My favorite is the Logan honey tea - it has pieces of Logan in it! Since this place has opened, we have already gone there enough times to get our stamp card filled. Aside from the bubble tea, Vivi also serves food. The prices seem pretty good for the food. They offer a ramen combo with popcorn chicken for only 9$! I haven't tried the food other than the popcorn chicken. The best flavor out of the ones I tried (spicy, basil, salt and pepper) is the spicy. They give you quite a bit of popcorn chicken too (only 4.50$!). Makes for a good walking snack when on your way out to the city on the Q or on the way back home.----------------------------Follow my Instagram for more pictures of yummy eats! instagram.com/eimiie"

I know what you're thinking...why not a donut?! Or a breakfast sandwich?! I know I know. But I'm a muffin person and had to check theirs out! Not sure if the muffin themselves are fresh as the donuts though. Was it the best muffin? No. But it wasn't bad. It's a soft muffin- kind of like the hostess mini muffin texture (not the kind that has crispy baked edges). Not a freshly baked type. I got the blueberry and it had sufficient amount of blueberry in it but weren't the big blueberry chunks. Still ate the whole thing but I would most likely try their donuts and/or breakfast sandwiches next time! Coffee is just simple cup of Joe. Nothing fancy. But make sure to tell them you don't want any cream or sugar! I told them black coffee once, only to drink it at work and it had cream AND sugar in it :( Service is friendly! The very first time I went was the worst (super unfriendly) but since then I've had pleasant visits :) Place always has people either grabbing something to go or eating in. So you know there's foot traffic and it's a staple for the people who live or work around the area. I'll still be stopping by for coffee. I'll also grab other food at different visits too!"

Didn't actually get much of a honey flavor but that fried dough taste came through loud and clear. Texture was wonderfully fluffy and light, and it tasted fresh. Definitely better than Dunkin'. Their menu is pretty sizable-- in addition to their donuts, they have many other breakfast food options. Interior was larger than I expected. I'll be back to try their other donut flavors!"

This place is an old school donut shop with the swivel seats providing, the obvious, donuts, savory breakfast and lunch sandwiche options. Drinks include anything from coffee, tea, soda, juice and water. The staff is friendly and used to its regular and new customers. My last order included egg whites and swiss cheese on a croissant. The croissant is flaky and light in texture. And egg whites are quite hard to flub up. I'm not a coffee drinker but my friends tell me the coffee is good. I also got a sugar donut, which was soft and light not doughy. The sugar used is not overly sweet put a nice light fully sugared donut. Unfortunately, I havent seen my brownies in a long time and not particularly sure I would be able to eat an entire one. There are many different meal options or you can just create your own. This place like I said is a staple and I really hope its not going anywhere. If your in the neighborhood check it out."

In case i dont make sense: if you put that much effort into keeping a placr clean it is assumed that you put as much effort into the outcome of the food. Or it simply could just be that they use alot of seasoning in their food and alot of sugar in their drinks.

Here they had a good set of local beer options, that offered some variety, but limited enough to still allow for the normal bar flow. During my visit I had an Imperial IPA and a Blueberry Sour. Two solid beers from NYC breweries that really showed how easy it is for bars to offer something extra.Quantity: Drafts of the local craft beers were a bit smaller than usual.Value: $8-$10 for Draft Beers.Ambiance: The Crown Inn is a bar located on Franklin Ave in Brooklyn. It has some dive bar characteristics, but is still pretty nice. The inside area that houses the bar and several tables was packed. The music was good, but too loud to keep up a conversation, so we moved outside. Behind the bar is a patio area with several tables, split into a smoking and non-smoking areas. The music only made it outside when the door opened, allowing guests on the patio to unwind as they sipped on their drinks. Crowd: The bar was very busy on Saturday night. There were two drastically different vibes with inside being lively and loud, while the outdoor patio was relaxed and chill.Service: The bartenders were excellent. With a loud and busy bar, they immediately recognized when guests needed a drink.Parking: Very limited street parking in the area."

That being said, I adore this place. It's cozy and has a great ambiance, perfect for first dates *wink wink* or simply catching up with friends. This is really useless and silly maybe, but I love that they have hooks for coats pretty much everywhere. So get comfy and tip your bartending staff!"
748,i6TXF9Oh-0TFb3AsifIuYg,4/12/2019,5 star rating,"Late dive or perfect night?The Crown Inn is one of those magical places that stays open way too late but is unexpectedly between two places. Yes, the prices are of a dive bar. The expectation is that of a dive bar.  But it's not scummy, crummy, or nasty in any way. It's ""nice"" in the way a generous pour of mescal is with a freshly cut orange. I wish we had a place like this in D.C."

I've been coming here for years and can't wait til quarantine is over and I can be back inside singing along to all my favorite songs, getting perfectly mixed drinks from wonderful people. In the mean time, they have an excellent setup that is Covid-friendly and makes walking up and ordering a drink feel almost normal :)"

Which is exactly the vibe and mood you'll be in for this place. Again, observing foolish behavior and insulting behavior towards people that hey ... look different than the posers hanging here deserve to be trolled.  Watching the bartender not be nice for what cuz someone might have gotten sick afternoon drinking a glass of seltzer as I saw you serve? Maybe a call to 311 and the nyc health department would wake you up and wonder why someone who was fine started to feel terrible after you severed a drink. Lulz.  Typical of shitty NYC BARS."

The establishment: really relaxing, candles everywhere. lights super dim. For such a small bar it seats more than enough. there are no tvs, however they have projectors (I've never seen them down tho) The have an outdoor patio that is just as intimate as the inside. they don't serve food but you're more than welcome to bring your own. I think it's a perfect place for someone with a chill state of mind or for someone who feels like they need to just get away from reality. The Drinks:I can't offer much in this department mainly because I drink whiskey 75% of the time. and then there's beer. they offer so many options. happy hour beer is rotating and they're are always good."

I'm not a fan of chocolate unless it's dark chocolate, but this place has a great assortment to choose from.  In addition, I was impressed by their selection of hot chocolate.  It was slightly quiet when I went, and there was ample seating space.  We also got two complimentary chocolate cakes as part of my hot chocolate.  It wasn't too sweet, nice and rich, topped with a little bit of whipped cream (at my request).  In full disclosure, this visit was on a cold day before COVID came about back back in February.  I can't wait to go back there and try the rest.  Just look at the assortment of chocolates from my photo!"

There are multiple franchises in Queens but it is way too far to travel just for a drink, so I was ecstatic to find out there was one on 86th street! I got the pink fleshy peach fruit yogurt & the durian yogurt. The peach yogurt is nice and refreshing but super addictive! It is not too sweet or sour so it was good. The durian yogurt is my personal favorite (only because I am super biased towards durian haha). It is a much thicker consistency than the other drinks they have, but the thickness compliments the durian really well. My only complaint about this location are the staff. They are a bit unfriendly and can come off a little rude (hence why the 4 stars instead of 5). Definitely call ahead of time for them to make your drinks or be prepared to wait 20+ minutes."

Finally got my chance to try their purple rice yogurt drink at this Bensonhurst location. The purple rice yogurt drink was good, but a bit expensive ($7.08 for a medium one). The first sip was a punch of yogurt on my face as I forgot to mix well and then I started liking it afterwards. The drink was definitely filling, felt like a whole meal."

Yomies tasted super fresh and was very refreshing. The first sip reminds me of summer. It also surprisingly super filling, and more thick than I expected, similar to a smoothie.I got the papaya flavor and my best friend got the grape one, i felt like we chose the least flavorful fruit (lol), so it made sense that the yogurt taste was overpowering. Im definitely getting the other choices next time because they have so many options! (Im ready for strawberry, peach, DURIAN!!)I see other yelpers saying the operations were bad BUT i felt like i got my drink pretty quickly! The ladies are also very sweet!"

I didn't realize they opened a Brooklyn location too so once I spotted it I had to try it! I ordered the Purple Rice Yogurt ($6.50) and the Mango Yogurt ($6.75), the former of which was my favorite. I felt the sweet vanilla yogurt flavor was more pronounced in the purple rice drink and the rice bits provided a deliciously savory undernote to the drink. The mango yogurt was alright but didn't stand out to me as much; I'd much rather have a lassi instead. Don't forget to check in for 20% off your order! They also have a stamp card-- 10 drinks get 1 free!"

Flash forward a couple of months and they conveniently open a branch on 86th street yay!! I've had purple rice drinks before and am a fan so I knew I had to try their signature purple rice yogurt smoothie. Did not disappoint at all! Perfectly thick, tangy and chewy. The red bean oats yogurt smoothie wasn't bad either. The red bean made it a bit sweeter. Also got the mango yogurt smoothie but wasn't a fan. Would recommend sticking with the purple rice options. I notice a lot of reviews here complaining about the wait time but I came here midday on a weekday and waited less than 10 mins. Service could've been nicer. I had a 20% off yelp check in offer that was flat out denied because they were ""still negotiating with the company"". The drinks are kinda pricey but worth a try or as an occasional treat."

Fast foward to 2022, and they finally opened two shops in NY. I tried their branch in Brooklyn and it's as good as I remembered - I like this drink much more than bubble tea or smoothies, because the subtle sourness complemented with the slight sweetness makes it extremely easy to digest and is full of healthy probiotics! Highly recommend giving it a try"

Fantastic service.We got the purple rice, passion fruit, and strawberry yogurt. The yogurt gives it a thicker consistency with a slight tanginess that pairs well with our choices since the seeds of the passion fruit and strawberry adds a nice texture. They use fresh fruits which is awesome!The purple rice had a good texture to it to that breaks the smoothness of the yogurt smoothie. It really fills you up too!All in all an amazing place with cute decor. Prices are reasonable and great fresh smoothies. 100% coming back here."

I live a solid 5 minute walk from this place and started venturing here after seeing my fellow Yelpers come to my side of Brooklyn. I ordered the Purple Thick Yogurt Milk drink. It felt like I was eating a brekkie oatmeal bowl with a straw but better tasting. A sweet, creamy and grainy texture and it did cool off my stomach from the sweltering heat.  The drink is really chunky and it does take a while to finish so be prepared for that. Especially if you're used to chugging your dessert drinks fast like a regular bubble tea."

Yelp is also offering a check in offer for a free soda with purchase until March.The place is very unkempt, there were lids and napkins strewn about. Pools of unknown liquid adorned the worn tabletops. The soda machine looked like it had long passed its prime and was bordering on dingy. I was reluctant to drink the soda for fear the machine had not been serviced in a while. The chicken is so salty and not great texturally. The celery sticks were unwashed, black dirt bespeckled the stalk and was easily removed with a light wipe so you know they didn't wash these. A deep and resounding, ""no"" for me."

When businesses base making money off of good customer service and great food it shows. This place was probably the worst businesses I've had the displeasure of entering and ordering from. Service: the main reason this place got a two star review was the horrid, rude, dismissive and flat out missing any attempt at good customer service. The cashier eyeballed my Yelp ""free soda"" coupon like it was a forgery...and all I wanted was a freaking cup of water-Which, by the way, this place refuses to let you get a cup for water without charging you for a soda first.  Cleanliness: tables dirty from prior customers, floor was dirty with food and trash. Ambiance: casual, rap music playing on a continuous loop. Seating: this place has some seating for about 12-18 people, but I'd recommend just grabbing your order to go. Food: the ONLY reason why this review has two stars instead of one.  smaller wings, more tasty than the normal oversized chunky wings you get elsewhere. Cooked perfectly and seasoned nicely. Really good flavor. I ordered the 6 piece garlic parmesan. My husband orders the 8-piece hot wings. Good flavor and cooked perfectly.

My sister and I were hungry so it was nice to be seated and served asap. Not many oyster options but at least they have them! They were also very meaty? Garlic bread as a side was okay. As for the main combo, it was plenty to share between 3 of us. We got mild spicy which is extra mild - barely had spice. It was probably our fault for trying to be too safe. We got lemon garlic sauce which was good but I think could be better if it was more flavorful! Maybe more lemon and Cajun? We will try regular spicy next time."

Customer service is key. you don't have to be perfect but little details go along way. The food however was great unfortunately I won't be back due to the front.

805,8G7FSv-uR_kdhFkP6RPZ0w,5/9/2018,1 star rating,My first time ordering from this place started with a female employee alerting me to the fact that the delivery guy may or may not come upstairs if he does not feel comfortable or no parking. The sandwich was absolutely disgusting. No seasoning no ketchup no napkins no tartar sauce. The apple juice was fabulous .The delivery guy reached my home and he looked afraid. He did not say hello just pushed the food in my hand. He looks like a skinhead nazi. This business needs to know how they come across. Scary racist people that only like black money but don't like delivering to our neighborhood. This is america

The only thing I disliked that I didn't realize was I ordered a half a tray of salad and they gave me a full tray. I believe I was charged for a large tray but it's ok, my party was great and everyone loved the food. The person I spoke to on the phone though was extremely nice and gave bread and extra plates and utensils and I thought that was extremely nice."

Everything including the frozen french fries was cold. The burger tasted like an ordinary burger - no grill taste - actually hardly any taste at all (i had to add ketchup and a slice on onion). Also ordered pasta with garlic and oil and asked for extra garlic - how about there was no garlic at all. Food was delivered with no utensils or napkins. Not recommended...........................Peter Luger serves a burger for the same price!"

815,d8qCvlsG3jwxQPZc_OGogQ,5/19/2021,4 star rating,"First time visiting Hibino, a small Japanese restaurant on Henry Street just south of Atlantic Avenue. Currently there is no sit-down dining, so order online for takeout. They stick a post-it note with your name on it in the window when your order is ready. I got a two-roll lunch special and ate it in the shade nearby. The salmon avocado roll was soft and sensual, dancing delicately on my tongue. The eel cucumber roll was sweet, with a satisfying crunch. Washed it down with miso soup, which was delightful! You gotta try that soup. I was a little disappointed that the lunch menu doesn't feature the home-made tofu that this place is famous for. I also had trouble entering my card number on mobile when ordering online. Luckily the employees were very patient and helped me get what I needed."

I remember coming on the weekend for lunches with my family as a young child, and it has only continued into adulthood. The staff is fantastic and everyone if incredibly nice. Kenta is a phenomenal server! The food never disappoints, the prices are more than reasonable for the quality Japanese food you get especially given NYC prices. The lunchtime special bento boxes are a steal! My favourite is the grilled salmon collar. Everything is so delicious and the experience is always so lovely!"

819,d8qCvlsG3jwxQPZc_OGogQ,1/7/2020,4 star rating,Cute little spot with a daily special obanzai menu so there's always something new the next time you go. Their homemade tofu is delicate and delicious. The miso salmon is buttery and rich. Their sashimi combo came with a side of rice? But it worked out because the miso salmon by default does not. The sashimi was sliced a little thick for my liking but that's a minor point. I noticed a lot of to-go orders but no option to order delivery or takeout online?Overall a great place with something new every day.
820,d8qCvlsG3jwxQPZc_OGogQ,10/11/2017,4 star rating,"I've always heard good things about Hibino and was finally able to stop in for dinner. If it's the weekend, prepare for a wait. It wasn't too bad for us, but we were also one of the last groups to be seated for the night (they close at 10 on weeknights and 10:30 on Friday/Saturday).Their obanzai (Kyoto style tapas) menu is unique, with a changing selection on their blackboards. We ordered a soft-shell shrimp roll, and a lobster roll from the list. Didn't know soft-shell crab was a thing, but it was delicious, even with the heads on and their tiny dead eyes staring back at you. The lobster roll was good, but very typical of Americanized sushi (too much sauce!).We ordered the yellowtail sashimi as well as tobiko (flying fish roe) from the sashimi menu (really just a small individual portion of roe). My friends who recently visited Japan definitely gave their seal of approval to the sashmi.We also started out with two types of tofu. Their fresh made tofu is served in a tiny jar with dashi sauce on the side. Velvetty and delicious. And their shrimp toji maki (shrimp wrapped in tofu skin, similar to a common dim sum dish) was good too.They have a ton of sake available at all price points, as well as beer.Would definitely come back!"
821,d8qCvlsG3jwxQPZc_OGogQ,7/3/2019,5 star rating,"This is one of my favorite sushi spots in NY(C)!Located on the rough and tumble streets of Cobble Hill just off Atlantic Avenue (sarcasm), you'll find an unassuming, authentic Japanese Izakaya that features high-quality affordable sushi, and a rotating menu of Kyoto-style tapas (obanzai).We sampled a number of tasty dishes throughout the evening:  a selection of obanzai's; a bunch of sushi rolls (spicy tuna, salmon, yellowtail jalapeno, and eel avocado); and an order of Tonkatsu.  We ordered the Aji Bo Sushi (horse mackerel, kelp, shiso, ginger) and Oboro Tamago Tofu (chilled egg tofu, dashi, snow crab, edamame) from the obanzai menu.  The Aji Bo Sushi was just okay.  The flavors didn't really mesh to be honest.  But that Oboro Tamago Tofu!  Wow, that was a mouthful! This dish had some really unique flavors and a generous serving of fresh snow crab.Re: the sushi rolls, our favorites were the spicy tuna and yellowtail, followed by the salmon.  While the eel was tasty and is always a solid choice, this slimy fish rarely stands out in my book.The Tonkatsu here is outstanding!  The pork is moist and flavorful; the crust is thin, well-seasoned, and crunchy; and it's served alongside a delicious dipping sauce.A word to the wise.  This place gets crowded on weekends.  No reservations.  Plan accordingly.P.S. the worn out interior and gruff service is part of the charm.  The complimentary tea at the end of the meal is a nice touch!"

823,MctQwL9Mp5X7DJk13VoERg,2/15/2023,2 star rating,Came here for dinner on a Tuesday with 2 other friends. The service is decent - the waiter / bartender (?) had made an extra drink and gave it to us so it wouldn't go to waste. Soups I believe come with free bread if you ask for it which is nice. However the reason behind my rating is because the food was so dry. I got the fish sandwich and even with the slaw it was dry and hard to eat - the fish itself. My friend got a salad and she could barely eat it too - I'm not sure there was dressing or it was really light.
824,MctQwL9Mp5X7DJk13VoERg,11/1/2022,5 star rating,"Great food, great drinks, great service, great ambiance. I've been hearing so many people rave about Westville and now it makes perfect sense. Went after a workout and boy did it hit the spot. I got the egg scramble with veggies, half salad, half home fries and gluten free toast. To drink I got the health tea which tasted incredible. They nailed it all. Tasted great and super fresh. You can differentiate the high quality of the foods and ingredients that they use. Our server was so great & accommodating. Not to mention, we were seated immediately on a Sunday afternoon which is hard to come by in the city. Would highly recommend!"

Luckily we were able to sit at the bar. The menu has a variety of main dishes, salads, soups. I ordered the burger with blue cheese and sweet potato fries. My burger was cooked perfectly medium and was very good. I liked the sweet potato fries even though they were somewhat limp. My friend had the tomato soup and said it was very good. Prices are reasonable for the area."

827,MctQwL9Mp5X7DJk13VoERg,10/2/2022,3 star rating,"Decent food but the table service was so-so. We had reservations for a party of 6 on a Tuesday. A couple of our party were running late but the hostess sat us anyway, which was nice.The highlight of Westville is their huge assortment of market vegetables. You can get just a plate of 3 veggies or entrees that included 2 choices. I ordered the grilled salmon plate with broccoli with garlic and brussels sprouts with honey dijon. The salmon was excellent. I ordered medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. I wasn't impressed with the vegetables, though. The broccoli was pretty bland and the sprouts weren't cooked enough. They looked like they were roasted but were still crunchy and not caramelized at all. So 5 stars for the salmon but 2.5 for the veggies.Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their meals. My wife liked her teriyaki salmon and another person said the vegan artichoke and quinoa burger was excellent (it was a special, not the regular vegan burger on the menu). The rest of the party also ordered cocktails (margaritas and palomas) and said there were good.Our service wasn't great. It seemed like we had to wait awhile a few times when we wanted stuff. The restaurant was busy so won't knock them too much. All in all, everyone was happy with their food and prices were good."

If you go with someone you like and want to have a conversation, it's quite difficult.I ordered the breaded chicken with broccoli and mushrooms. Everything was well cooked and felt healthy but it was all rather plain. I had to add salt to everything.With all the choices in Manhattan I probably would not bother to return."
829,MctQwL9Mp5X7DJk13VoERg,3/5/2022,5 star rating,"Great dinner at Westville last night! Reservations were definitely needed on a cold Friday night if you wanted to sit inside; they have a parklette which I imaging fills up in warmer weather. Their website says parties of 2 are limited to 1 hour; we were there a bit longer and it didn't feel like they were rushing us yet when we were done they cleared the table quickly. The mulled red wine cider was the perfect warm bevy to start with. For some reason we were worried about the portion sizes so my husband and I over-ordered and ended up with too much food but that's ok because everything was delicious :) We started with the Truffle Parm fries and Brussels Sprout poppers (would've been enough food had we only ordered one app). Then we split the crispy chicken with two sides (zucchini and tomatoes, and grilled tofu), and two hot dogs with one side (broccoli rabe with red peppers).Everything was amazing and our server Mitchell was attentive and super friendly!"

Food was all super yummy, and I felt super healthy after eating all the greens and veggies offered. We got some fries and mac and cheese to share in the beginning. Mac and cheese was YUMMY. I got salmon plate with dijon brussel sprouts (YUM) and yuca fries. I wish they didn't only give 4 yuca fries but whatever. My boyfriend ordered the sherperd's pie and really liked it. For drinks, I got the green tea toddy which was *chef's kiss* - had never tried a toddy before and was super glad that was my first experience! The boys got a bunch of beers. Waiters were funny and we had good service. Would love to come back and try more veggies!"

Be aware that you do need a reservation on a weekend if you want to sit indoors, unless there's bar seating open, but overall seating is pretty limited. Service is great and our servers were friendly and attentive. The food was also awesome. I never recommend a side salad over fries but this is one exception. I don't know what the dressing is but it was amazing! Overall a really fun vibe, just a little pricey and hard to get in.  I'd love to go back to try the dinner menu since there are a ton of options!"

Most of the books are used and usually everything that I pick up is under $10, averaging about $5.I always wonder how places like this stay in business, but I'm just glad that they're around! They sometimes host events and there is always a person or two loitering around, enjoying the books. Don't miss the science fiction section, it's tucked away in the corner to your right as soon as you walk in.The staff is also nice and helpful. Chat them up if you're looking for some recommendations."

The guy behind the counter was quick and efficient even though some friends of his were in line before me and obviously wanted to chat about a recent show they were all at. The barista quickly spoke to them, (even though the friends wanted more conversation time), made their order and proceeded to help me. All in a smooth and professional manner. I was imagining standing there for 10-5 minutes waiting for him to finish his conversation but not this time. The hot coffee was excellent and the coconut dark chocolate muffin was incredibly good. It had just the perfect amount of chocolate, with a very light crumb topping, and light coconut flavor. Get this muffin with a hot coffee on a fall or winter day and the rest of your day will be wondrous because of it. Oh and check out the books too! So many great books here!This place makes me feel like I am in the Pacific Northwest at a coffee shop in Olympia, WA."

From the cozy bookstore aesthetic to the welcoming staff, this little shop screams love story.I'm a tea guy (I know, I know) so I haven't tried the coffee. If you're looking for good tea in this neighborhood this is the place. I sat for maybe an hour once and the barista offered a free refill as soon as I looked up from my book. I didn't get the sense he was watching me intently, I think he was just attentive. He also had great taste in music.The bookstore end of the business is awesome. They take orders, buy books back, are knowledgeable, and even tell you where to get books they might not carry. To me that's the sign of a business that cares.Alright enough geeking out about this spot. I recommend it for a relaxing morning or evening. Go alone or with a buddy, there's not a ton of space and it's been decently full every time I've gone."

They put stretchy cheese on top of the pizza.  They also put melted cheese inside the pizza crust. When I eat the cheese, it feels like I'm in cheesy heaven.  A second reason is, they put pineapples on the pizza. You can also get it with no pineapples. You can make your own pizza with whatever toppings you want, like pepperoni or mushrooms. All the toppings are delicious.

It was a two and a half hour ordeal and i never got my food since the store stopped answering calls -which is understandable since they had closed at this point but like i said, i was waiting for a while and the order was placed an hour and a half before closing time.And the time before this, i had specific direction (which no other delivery person has issue with cuz it's supposed to help both the delivery person and myself ‍) to call when turning onto my block so i can meet driver outside and the guy calls me aggressively yelling at me about where i'm at and how he needs to go cuz there's no parking.

The service was bad. We didn't get our drinks until half way through our entrees. The waitress seemed pretty clueless. Besides the dismal service the food just sucked. We got the miso pork bao buns -- the bun itself was not soft or warm -- was clearly old. The pork was tough it was like chewing on rubber. The spicy pork and beef bulgogi bibimbaps were both so bland. Thank godfor gochunjang! The food was not hot enough to even cook the raw egg they put on top of the meat. The rice wasn't getting crispy in the dolsot and the amount of meat was very disappointing.  To top it off they are cash only -- come on! It's 2022! They also add 18% gratuity. I normally always tip at least 25%; but the service was so bad here I felt like it was too much. This is not the place.

I kept adding hot water in to dilute it at 1:1 ratio.Vegetable Pancake $7 - just looks sad even looking at it. Flavorless and soggy.It's sad to leave this review during this time but we come out to support restaurant and restaurant also need to look at what they are serving. I understand korean food we are suppose to eat with rice (well the rice was the only perfectly cooked item among what we had), but this was just unacceptable. It was becoming a pain every single bite, and towards the end felt sick from the food. And since it was extremely heavy, the flavor in my mouth and my body made me feel nausea throughout the rest of the day.Felt such a waste of money and damaging my body from this meal. Never again."
859,GDWVTV11eq92ElXD9mstBw,11/1/2022,3 star rating,Have been meaning to try this spot out for a while since I frequent St. Marks so often. Got the bulgogi bibimbap and was a tad disappointed. It wasn't very very fresh or flavorful and felt pricey considering the quality. Probably won't be coming back any time soon but maybe I need to try something else.
860,GDWVTV11eq92ElXD9mstBw,8/27/2021,4 star rating,My friend and I sought refuge from the thunderstorms and came here for lunch. We ordered the garlic soy chicken wings (6 pcs) and the kimchi fried rice. The rice wasn't as flavorful as I expected but good for people who don't like spice or minimal spice. The chicken wings were really good! They came out crispy and hot. However the drumsticks are a bit tough to bite into. The atmosphere was chill since it was only us eating and the service was alright.

We also ordered the fries- my friends loved them. I wasn't too big of a fan, but that's just me. I like plain fries with any sides or condiments on the side. There was the option of choosing your spice level for the spicy rice cakes. We chose mild- they definitely were NOT mild. For the amount given for the price- it's not worth it. Whenever you in Mark's Place- come here for the CHICKEN!!"

I've only had Ethiopian food a few times, but this really was on another level. The feast for 3 had so much variety and easily fed the 6 of us (in fact, we had some leftovers). The injera was so soft and delicious (you may need to order more to help clean up the plate). The Enguday ribs (mushrooms) was our favorite, and first to go, but I also enjoyed the Keys Selata (beetroot) and Misis Wot (lentils) a lot. To be honest all of it was good.The Lentil Sambusa is what really took the crown for me... the sambusa itself was good, but the star was the sauce on the side. That alone makes this a 5 star trip, simply incredible. I can't wait to go back."

I think it was some kind of soy with cashew cream, potatoes and kale. Everything was tasty. Plantains were good too. I just wish there was more for picky kids but I get that it's the flavor and culture that makes this place stand out. The bread was also good. Excited to come again for dinner."

865,l4fwf8VwAokv3MWT45Ab7g,9/23/2022,5 star rating,"Ethiopian food is not just delicious it's a requirement in my dining rotation. I simply have never gotten enough of it since first trying over 20 years ago! While most Ethiopian restaurants have a respectable amount of vegan dishes anyway, hitting up a 100% plant-based Ethiopian restaurant is such a treat. Also, they are all about the coffee (truth in a name). The lunch special is pretty incredible in these oh-so-expensive times. For $12 one gets a scoop of 4 different items. I ordered the Tibs (crimini mushrooms, quite succulent and garlicky), Gomen (slighly sour and fragrant collards with ginger and coriander), Misir Wot (ohhhh my spicy berbere lentils! I could order just a whole platter of this alone) and Yatakilt Alicha (similar in flavor profile to the Gomen). This comes with a plentiful amount of injera but I know that's polarizing for some people, not me, so you can get rice if you prefer.I started with the Kedija Selata and this is the sole time I wish had asked for a fork as I didn't want to fill up on injera. It also could have used just a touch of salt. Otherwise it's a perfect kale salad!One slight regret: I had stupidly drank way too much coffee earlier in the day so I sadly did not try theirs. It just means that I have to return, obviously, preferably at 5pm on Fri/Sat/Sun when they have their coffee ceremony!"
866,l4fwf8VwAokv3MWT45Ab7g,3/27/2022,5 star rating,"It seems like every one of my reviews of an Ethiopian restaurants starts with ""THIS is the best one I've been to"". I admit it, I'm obsessed with Ethiopian food, and even when it's not amazing I'm still usually satisfied. BUT BUNNA CAFE IS TRULY SPECTACULAR. First, the Bunna Coffee. You HAVE to order it. The warm blend of spices concentrated into all of five gulps for me  sent my head straight up to the stars. I cannot drink regular coffee from anywhere again. Pretty sure this is what the discovery of color television from watching black and white felt like. We went for brunch, so they didn't have the typical menu of injera and curries. I was very pleased to explore a side of Ethiopian cuisine I've never had before. (I had no idea that ""Kita"" - the same as a Malaysian puff paratha - is also eaten in Ethiopia). The two breakfast combos we ordered allowed us to try every side dish! Out of them all, the ""Duba Firfir"" was my favorite - tangy, sort of meaty tasting, and perfectly complemented by the cashew sauce. This is without a doubt the FRESHEST tasting Ethiopian food I've ever eaten. There was something about the flavors and colors that just popped. And trust me, the lack of meat on the menu will neither be missed nor noticed."

I ordered the enguday tibs with white rice and it was delicious. I also tried the kerkede shai tea and it was really good. I don't like a lot of different coffees or teas but this hit the spot. I got it iced with a lemon and it was perfect for today. Overall, this was a great first experience for Ethiopian food. Next time I am in Brooklyn, I will have to try to get here again!"

This restaurant has been on my list for quite some time, but I never got the chance to stop in. I was pleasantly surprised by the entire experience. First off the restaurant is dimly lit, and beautiful sounding music played in the back ground as you enter. The staff was very friendly and helpful when it came to explaining the menu. We weren't too too hungry so we ended up ordering a feast combo to split, and cocktails. I had the Kerkede which was a hibiscus and ginger cocktail. Absolutely delicious! The food came out relatively quickly and was amazing! Enough food for two, if you are moderately hungry. The best part of the experience was the traditional coffee ritual that occurs everyday around 5pm. It was very cool to sit as coffee was being made throughout our meal. This only happens once a day, so I recommend coming around that time to witness the process. The best part was everyone there at that time is offered a cup. Some of the best coffee I've ever had! I definitely recommend coming into Bunna Cafe for a meal. You won't regret it."

We went with 4 people and shared 5 appetizers then shared the main entree but chose the feast for two since we had eaten so many apps. My favorite parts were the enguday tibs, shiro, and keysis setata. I don't like beets or mushrooms but the way these were made were to good to not eat. The restaurant is all vegan but I didn't miss the meat at all!"

First was a hot alcoholic drink with mint, cinnamon , tequila etc and it was so amazing.

My partner had recommended the spot for me as he enjoyed it. And I totally agree the place is nice and coffee is tasty. I ordered an ice latte and ice coffee and asked the barista to watch my order as I needed the restroom. I came back to see she has made a hot latte which I asked her to make it iced. She then said to me' NO, you told me just a latte' and was quite rude about it. I was shocked. TBH, if I had forgot I would have apologized and said 'sorry! Yes I did' but since I didn't, I felt that was really rude esp from a customer service kind of view. Sure, misunderstandings may occur but one can say ' oh I thought you said hot, or okay' NOT ""no you didn't"". I didn't argue and thanked her as I wanted to enjoy my Saturday but wowNot I'm unsure if I will return and my bf was upset when he saw me return and asked me if he wanted me to speak to her but I said no.

The sandwich had toasted sourdough bread doused with olive oil, pesto, chicken breast, and mozzarella cheese. It came with a side salad of arugula and cherry tomatoes, with a sweet dressing and pumpkin seeds. After that satisfying, delicious lunch, I worked undisturbed for several hours before heading out.

I am a student, and I really was enjoying coming here because it's never too busy and the music is not distracting. It felt nice to get a change in setting and support a small local business. The place is decorated nicely, and the black coffee (my usual order) is fresh and strong. However, today I had a completely opposite experience. I ordered my coffee and set up my laptop to get some work done, and then the lady decided to mention to me after the fact that apparently there is a 1.5 hour limit on the weekends because they ""get extremely busy."" (It didn't, by the way). As someone who travels and intends to stay somewhere for more than an hour and a half, this would have been very nice to know PRIOR to sitting down and *over-paying* for something that I could easily make at home. I don't know why I was apparently charged $2.75 one day for an 8 oz coffee, $3.50 another time, and $3.25 another day for the SAME cup. On the menu, this 8 oz cup of black coffee is listed as $1.75. A little sketchy, to say the least. No where is there a sign (not even on their website) that there is a 1.5 hour limit to seating. Moreover, I did not hear them mention this ""policy"" to any of their other customers. In fact, they were significantly warmer and more welcoming to all of their other customers, greeted them nicely, and even followed up with them to make sure that everything was made to their liking. With me, however, it seemed that they were only able to pass glares and major attitude every time they walked by me (I was sitting in a corner minding my own business). What's crazier is that there were PLENTY of open tables. The majority of my time there, I was the only one in the whole cafe (not including the cashier and baristas). I felt incredibly uncomfortable, and I am so disappointed that I don't think I will ever be coming back here. Some other notes: they do not wipe down the tables after customers sit and eat, which I thought was surprising considering, you know, we are in the middle of a pandemic (and just standard restaurant hygiene, pandemic or not). The outlets do not work. I was the first customer in today and there were bread crumbs all over the chairs, which I just shook off and used to spend my time efficiently. The bathroom is cramped and always filthy. Also, I am a type 1 diabetic with strict dietary restrictions. Felt my blood sugar crashing and quickly took out a snack before I passed out. The same lady, on one of her rounds to check on me, was quick to come call me out on it and mentioned that they have food and drinks there. Absolutely inconsiderate and deplorable. What an awful experience and terrible way to treat a regular customer. Thanks, Tin Cup. It was fun while it lasted."

I dont usually drink too much soup but I drank a lot and I gonna say some of that broth for my own noods  (pro tip).

The place is tiny and right by Baruch so of course it's generally quite crowded.General notes: A bit pricey for portion size.Tea eggs are good though the ""egg"" listing as extra is just a plain hard boiled for $1.25 which is ridiculous. Their noodles are alright also.I got the tea egg as well as the eel over rice the first time which was similar to what you can find in Japanese places. The sauce is less sweet than the Japanese counterpart and while I liked it, I found the portions to be a bit tiny for the price. The side seaweed salad was fine. The milk green tea was alright as well. It had some good tea flavor but it was a tad too sweet. The tea eggs were good though I'd prefer if I didn't have to peel them myself.The second time for lunch I got their bam bam noodle which is their take on minced pork over rice as well as their tea eggs again. I asked the waitstaff whether the egg extra listed in toppings is a tea egg and it turned it it was a plain cut hard boiled egg so I didn't bother. I found the dish slightly oily and not too spicy so I added some of their chili oil which was alright. I also added one of the tea eggs from my appetizer for some extra flavor. The dish worked well enough for lunch but I wouldn't go out of my way.Around 3 star or 3.5 star would be more accurate for the quality of food compared to the prices. However, there aren't many good Chinese in the area (though there is definitely more now than there used to be) so this place does well especially with Baruch nearby. Place is alright. 3.4"

The portion sizes here are meant for sharing, but the space inside isn't too big, so I would say that this place is good for tables of 4. Either that or my partner and I were placed in one part of the restaurant that is better suited for smaller parties. My partner and I came on a Sunday around 1PM and were able to be seated within 15 minutes. I think wait times are variable, but the service here is efficient, so I was very surprised that we didn't have to wait long at all for a place that's popular. We ordered: - sweetened soymilk -- came in a huge bowl. One per two people is plenty. Perfectly sweetened - shrimp and pork soup dumplings -- would highly recommend having one order for the table because the soup was amazing - char siu bao -- amazingly fluffy. A must get. You get three huge baos - sticky rice w/ chicken -- a hidden gem here in my opinion. Delicious flavor and texture. I feel like many dim sum restaurants do not make this well- shanghai pan fried udon noodles -- flavor not as strong as other restaurants, but the texture of the noodles was excellent. It was a bit too oily for my tastes, but if you're a fan of this dish, I would consider ordering it to try for yourself - shrimp rice roll -- one of the best rice rolls I've had. The texture is a bit chewier, but I like it this way. The sauce was also perfectly balanced between sweet and soyThey also gave us a free sample of the peking duck bun for dine in -- the flavor was amazing and I would order that if I ever come again."

When seated there was hot tea in the kettle that was already prepared and also gave us water when we asked for it. So the service was pretty good. We knew we had to try the Peking duck buns, soup dumplings, in addition, we wanted to try some of their noodles so we opted to go for the Seafood pan-fried udon. Peking duck buns: They were delicious. The skin was very flavorful and crispy along with the pairing of the duck that was juicy and savory from the fattiness. The bao was fluffy and not dry at all. You get a free peking duck bun if you spend $10 or more or an option of a order of pork soup dumplings. Garden special soup dumplings/Soup dumplings with Crab Meat and pork: Tasted very good and were quite flavorful. Aside from the different toppings within the dumplings, the soup itself was quite similar. They have different components that you can add to the soup dumplings such as soy sauce, sliced ginger and hot chili oil/paste. Seafood pan-fried udon: Udon was more on the heavy saucy, greasier side of the spectrum, but good nonetheless. The seafood portion came with about 2 pieces of each such as fish, squid, imitation crab meat, scallop etc. with some a little bit more like the pieces of shrimp, they are on the smaller end. Also had a little bit of bok choy and veggies along with it. Good, but I would probably want to order and try something else next time. Lastly, it ended with a complimentary serving soup of Tangyuan (sweet rice balls) in a sweet delightful soup.This is a cash-only place, but they have an atm on site if you need to withdraw any money."

Not only is the food delicious and reasonably priced (with lots of non-mainstream dishes), but they also give a free food item (you choose either peking duck sandwich per person or an order of XLB) with purchase of $10 or more, but they also give free bowl of jiu niang yuan zi at the end, which is a Chinese dessert (mostly associated with Zhejiang region) consisting of chewy mini glutinous rice balls, sweet fermented rice, and osmanthus. Manhattan could never lmao. I haven't had jiu niang yuan zi in years so this really took me back to childhood.We ordered shrimp rice roll, pan fried pork buns, pork XLB, and marinated cucumber to share and chose the peking duck sandwich as our free item. Everything was tasty and fresh. I also ordered the duck intestine/blood vermicelli soup for myself which is something I enjoyed a lot during my childhood trips to China but haven't found much of in the US. It was light and just filling enough. There was less duck intestine and more duck blood than I imagined but the intestine was still very flavorful and I'd order this again. Service was fast and there were lots of open tables when we came on a Sunday around 12:30pm! There is a restroom in the restaurant and they are cash only."

Got the spicy beef tripe, Shanghai special chicken, soybean pudding, and Shanghai sautéed vegetables. Unfortunately, we found small bugs in the Shanghai sautéed vegetables and Shanghai special chicken after eating some of it. Saw a bug on a bamboo piece and found more small bugs while inspecting the food... lost my appetite just thinking about having ingested some critters. We threw them in the garbage. The soybean pudding and beef dishes seem to be critter-free. Waste of food and money. Highly disappointing and disgusted..."

I haven't had Peking duck buns like this, since I was actually in China. Normally you'll be spending an arm and a leg to get this and a fancy restaurant in Manhattan, but here in Queens if you get it for a fraction of the price and probably the tastiest you'll ever have, I'm assuming there's seating indoors, but they offer a very convenient, outdoor dining and pick up option which we did. Peeking duck buns on the go... Perfect for me. I will definitely be back to have his ones and moon cakes. (Located right next-door to them) very soon."
901,R0y03SFOY0BdHRUT1LSO0Q,12/10/2022,4 star rating,On my day off to flushing enjoying my local go to areas. I stumbled on this this place. It has been a while. I saw the sign for peking Duck bun for 2.50 the prices has gone up since i last had one but for 2.50 this is definitely delicious. The duck was tender and the bun soft a good combination. Its even good the second day when heated up in the air fryer. I ordered from the walk up window and the staff was very friendly. Watched them make it when i ordered. The duck and bun was still warm as I handed my order. Only thing I wished as i am enjoying this was a little more greens and just a tad more sauce but that is a personal preference that i would ask for next time I go back.

We decided on Zio Luigi based on favorable reviews, location and the fact that they opened early enough for a senior to have an early dinner. This place is tiny so I was a bit wary.  I must say we couldn't have beeen happier with our choice. They accommodated all 11 of us. And although the place is small, it was just fine. We had the place to ourselves so it was intimate and lively. Jimmy, our waiter, was great. He was so accommodating and he provided great service. Our appetizers were delicious,  we ordered the rice ball, meatballs, and others-all delicious. our main courses were fantastic! Pastas were homemade, and the gnocchi-unbelievable! We brought our own bottles of wine since it's BYOB-no cork fees!  Oh, and coffee came out piping hot! Dessert was delicious,! Can't say enough how great this little restaurant was! My mom was thrilled.  So happy that we took a chance on this little place."

There is not a charge to bring in your favorite bottle of wine or alcoholic beverage and enjoy it with the meal.Ill start with the negatives, I ordered the pork and lamb bolognese pasta and it was subpar. The peas had been overcooked and hard and the sauce was lacking in any distinct flavor. I was roundly disappointed mostly because it was the main dish.However, the prosciutto and burrata were pretty good. Very savory and wonderful with a touch of olive oil. The tiramisu was also fairly good here.Seems like some of the things on the menu here up to par and some are not. It might be worth another try in the future."

You could make a better meal yourself with a box of Ronzoni and a jar of Ragu. The meatballs were definitely not homemade nor was any of the pasta in the four dishes we ordered. The vodka sauce was the worst Ive ever had and the marinara tasted as if it was cheap jarred sauce. The bread was stale. No one ate More than a few bites of their plate. It was bland and while edible, not worth the money. I would never order from them again."

Came for lunch and had the entire restaurant to myself. Tried a few things that others have raved about and I was not disappointed. The linguini frutti di mare was done wonderfully, with the pasta cooked just right. The squid ink pasta was OK, nothing wrong with it but nothing really to write home or Yelp about. The baked clam was excellent, and the tiramisu was really good and not too sweet. Overall an excellent experience and a solid Italian restaurant, and I will be sure to return."

The best part was the shrimp was not over cooked which can be an issue in some restaurants when they don't know what they are doing.  The finale to an absolutely wonderful dining experience was a slice of tiramisu.  A fresh delightful dessert that melts in your mouth.  By far my favorite dessert ever, especially when made properly.  Our server was very attentive and on point with refilling water, checking on us periodically to see if we needed anything and if the meal was to our liking.  If you drink...BYOB, yes you read it correctly.  I was looking for a ""go to"" Italian eatery and Zio Luigi is on my map for good."

I usually order Petto di Pollo Sopreze; I love that they use an airline cut (breast w/ drumette), chicken is flavorful & juicy. My partner usually gets penne alla vodka + chicken Milanese. Their sauce is light & the Milanese is truly thin & crispy, just how we like it!I'm looking forward to the day I can enjoy a meal at their restaurant, as I am sure they won't disappoint!"

And now, we review:I've hit up Zio Luigi 3-4 times (friends live in Sunnyside), once for brunch and a couple for dinner. Bottom line - whatever you order, chances are, its going to be delicious.The first time I went to Zio Luigi was for brunch, I had veggie frittata, which was delightful and we shared the polpettini (who doesn't love meatballs). That said, the highlight of my first outing was the tiramisu. Tiramisu isn't really my go-to dessert, but Zio Luigi does it right. Delicious. That said, during this first meeting, a friend mentioned that he had had the filet mignon with gorganzola the other night, and how incredible it was. And so the quest for the famed filet began.My next outing at Zio Luigi was new year's eve for dinner. 8PM. Party of 8. Okay - time for the filet. The friend that had gushed over the filet at the previous brunch orders first. The filet. The server says ""okay, we only have one left, so that's you"". One left. At 8PM. On New Years Eve. I mean..cmon now. Really? Yes, the rest of us were S.O.L.  In my reassessing haste, I settled on the Linguini Neri (seafood squid ink pasta), and it was packed with seafood (no skimping here) and solid back-up play to the M.I.A. filet.Annnnd just recently, we had another dinner outting Uncle Louie's (we're close now). I arrived about 5 mins before the reservations, with the table still not yet ready (party packing up), but was offered a nearby table to chill and wait for the others. I had to ask...""how are you doing on the filets, tonight?"" The server smiled and reassured me that if I desired the famed filet tonight...it was mine. ::joy:: So, all the folks arrive and we're seated, the bottles begin to pop, and the table bread arrives - TIP: the sun-dried tomato spread that comes with the bread is amaaaaazing.The server then relayed the specials of the day .etc, but all I heard was blah blah, filet mine mine. Well, that wasn't all I heard,  because there was a white bean soup special app, and on a cold early March night...that sound nice. It also tasted amazing - a massive bowl, hearty enough for a meal on its own.On came the filet. And I've been let down before - for instance, after hearing about this dish (and post-NYE let down), I ordered what seemed to be a similar dish, only with the Gorgonzola cheese in the side mashed potatoes, not on the filet itself. And oh man, does it make a difference. Glorious and worth the wait.And finally, it was time for more wine...and dessert. We opted for the obligatory tiramisu and, on strong-willed suggestion, the chocolate mousse cake. The tiramisu lived-up to its past tastiness, but the chocolate mousse was no slouch at all - a star in its own right; rich and delightful.All in all - you can't go wrong at Zio Luigi's, but you can really really go right with the filet. And the tiramisu. And the meatballs. And the table bread...."

Open air setup with a couple tables outside and a modest multilevel interior. Walked in and grabbed the nearest two-seater we could find.Scannable menu for all the drinks and food options available. Settled on a glass of the Monastrell ($12) to go along with a two-cheese plate ($17). Wine is an okay pour, strong flavor but not too overpowering. The cheese plate consisted of the two cheeses I selected (Stilton and Piave) as well as some crostinis, grapes and olives. Stilton packs a punch as expected, while the Piave is extremely mild (best paired with something else). Wish the plate came with some nuts and jam to give more balance.Service here is lackadaisical. No suggestions for the food or wine, and the waiter kept leaving our table before taking/asking for a food order. Bill at the end was presented on a tablet un-itemized, so I couldn't confirm if anything was correct. Overall wasn't a fan of the ambiance or service so would not make a return trip."

We were also celebrating a birthday and so our server was nice enough to bring us some complimentary shots!

We got Deviled Eggs for the table and I got the Toasted Daniele sandwich. Both were very yummy. The only thing I wish was that the bread on the sandwich was toasted. The sandwich was also very large so you could definitely share it with 2 people.My friends and I definitely plan on coming back for the $1 oyster HH.

I ordered a drink and attempted to order 15 oysters to start off the evening.  The waiter told me there's a 6 oyster limit per person which isn't written anywhere on their menu. They said it's because people would come in and order a lot of oysters which backs up the kitchen. I was quite sad that they have this ""unwritten rule"". If they were afraid of selling so much oysters, then they shouldn't write that on their menu. It's very misleading. I would've ordered more drinks and food if I could eat more oysters :/ it just left a bad taste in my mouth and overall bad experience. Just be cautious if you guys go here."

The oysters aren't the best quality but that's to be expected for $1.Overall this is a good place to come to split a cheese board and catch up with friends over some drinks. Their cocktail menu is interesting and has some fun twists on classic drinks!

They do a good job of presentation without pretension which I appreciate in a cocktail joint.I also got the toasted daniele and a cheese board of manchego (came with grapes, olives/cornichons, and lots of toasted baguette slices) and it was a LOT of food. I could have done just one and been happy! The toasted daniele was really good, great balance of crispy savory salty tangy briney etc with all of the ingredients stacked on each other. The portion for the cheese was great (and I'm normally quite skeptical of portion sizes at places that do charcuterie).All in all, great spot, both for my evening of decompressing from a long week or a cute first date. Enjoy!"

They use to have the kind of employees that get upset that you actually want to be served...I'm sure we all know what I am talking about...I didn't experience that this time! Thankfully.Employees were nice, they had all of the ingredients for the harvest bowl...no complaints here! If I'm craving a salad, I'll be back.

However, I can see why the bad reviews. As I was leaving half hour later there was a line almost by the door. I also noted there were only about 2-3 staff working the assembly line. The truth is lines at sweetgreen are inevitable. I think it all depends at what time you visit but if you want to avoid this just order online for pick up."

We were surprised it wasn't busier on a mild December Thursday night - the front yard had a lot of heaters, socially distanced seating (some in glass cabins!), and a wood fire pit. Not pet friendly according to a sign by the entrance, maybe not the best draw for clientele such as Park Slope/Gowanus. We opted for indoor seating and were the only ones inside. Ordering was a little funky (it's an order-and-pay-via-app situation), but we got the hang of it. We had 3 tacos each plus churros and chips and were very full. My favorite taco was the steak fajita! You can tell the food is made fresh to order, and I appreciated that they brought it all out in stages and not all at once. Very friendly staff and would definitely return!"

The problem is that they refused to pay me which is illegal. They tried to claim the 2 shifts were a working interview but actually had me making drinks during both shifts. They refused to pay me for my time and I was forced to file a claim with the NY Department of labor. I'm glad to say that I won my case because what they did was blatantly illegal. What kind of employer would try to take advantage of someone for a measly 60 bucks? I'm sure that they try to pull this scam with other new hires and am thankful that the department of labor agreed with me.

938,c6aQNxYlU1IeRrgSIZj6iw,2/12/2021,2 star rating,"Let me start by saying that we went on a very cold night for outdoor seating and some of these issues are absolutely due to the environment caused by that. The heater they provided on the table blew out twice - by blow out I mean a fireball pushed out towards our faces likely due to a push of gas. It was pretty dangerous actually, they took it back after the first time and said they fixed it then it happened a second time and the several other parties at different tables looked over at us because it was so loud and visible. It didn't appear that anyone else had an issue with the heater at the table, for what that's worth. After that, they were hospitable in that they provided us complimentary blankets for the remainder of dinner, which we appreciated very much!The ordering process was easy and each person can order and pay on their own food and drinks. You scan the QR code associated with/on your table and there are food runners dropping food off. Turn around time between ordering and receiving food was very quick, which was nice.They also have great COVID protocols with taking temperature, logging information and a thorough (if not lengthy) policy review you must complete before being seated.We started with Guacamole which was just really under-seasoned. Some salt and lime and they would have been in a much better spot.All the hot food was room temperature at best upon arrival to our table. Again, definitely a problem with the outside temperature. It just didn't seem like they were heated enough inside first which could have helped combat the weather a little.Let me say, though, the vegetarian taco was the star for me this night [Huitlacoche (Mexican truffle), taro, Persian pickle aguachile, corn tortilla (V+GF)]. The flavors were fantastic and truly unlike any other combination I've had before.The pulpo taco also was interesting. The octopus was cooked well but flavor was lacking and it would have ate better if it was cut differently. For lack of a better comparison, it kind of reminded me of eating a hot dog because the tentacle was so large and untreated.The frito pie was also an interesting play on the normal dish by making it into a fritter.The grilled steak tlacoyos was a good dish. The steak was seasoned well and avocado sauced brought the otherwise dry masa back to life. I'm not familiar with this dish but the base was masa stuffed with black beans and ultimately ended up being bulky compared to the steak and topping.My drink was really rough, (MANZANA BLANCA - Barking Irons White Night overproof applejack whiskey,  Giffard rhubarb, lemon, egg white, orange bitters) the egg white was disproportionate to the other ingredients so it had an off-putting smell and taste. I didn't get any citrus flavor whatsoever, I could not get past the unpleasant egg white issue.I ended up getting an EXPERIENCIA RELIGIOSA (Altos Blanco Tequila, kiwi palo santo shrub, lime, ginger) to drink instead which was much better. I enjoyed the drink but did not taste any ginger as advertised, it truly reminded me of a margarita. I did like the dehydrated kiwi garnish though!For dessert we tried the churros, they were cold and tasted bland but the dipping chocolate had a nice kick to it.I would not go back here, sadly. I think there were certain things out of their control but they missed the mark on other items. I'm certain it would be a better experience in warmer weather or when indoor seating comes back but I think some attention to detail and consistency with the food would have helped avoid some of the other issues we had."

Apparebtly in the before times it was a great spot to let your children run around while adults imbibe. Now it's more contained which is totally understandable. Would recommend!

In the same token, it's confusing for first timers people to find El Atoradero when the only sign outside is Parklife. But I digress, as a venue on its own, Parklife is solid. Real solid. Independently working but sharing the same indoor space as Taqueria El Atoradero, Parklife's pros are almost immediately recognized by anyone who is halfway paying attention:* Semi-spacious outdoor seating. There are seats for all group sizes and lots of standing room for minglefests of any kind. * Super family friendly. Park the stroller next to the table and let the kids run amuck in the sand and/or play some shuffleboard. In reality, this is the best park anyone could ask for: let the kids play while the adults imbibe. That's a huge win.* They serve drinks. Not overpriced like the tacos, but a solid selection of wine, brews, and cocktails. Pay at counter or run up a tab and pay later.The part where things could probably be a little better is mainly service oriented. I could complain about the wait for the food, but that's not on Parklife. Instead, I've gotten a bit of attitude from some of the guys pouring the drinks, but nothing major. It's just young guys throwing around some humor and not being all that professional. Awhile back when I was looking for El Atoradero, I actually called Parklife through the listing to see if they could advise on how to find it. The person on the phone was a bit snappy and basically insinuated that our group wasn't too smart. We eventually figured out the joke -- it was all under the same roof.Would I come back to Parklife? Definitely. Whether I'm looking to kill time before another Kick Axe throwing session or a nice outdoor spot where I could enjoy some drinks and good company. With the latter, Parklife is an ideal spot to enjoy it."

It made me question if they were leftovers at the time. I'm so glad I gave this place another try in the evening and the cupcakes were very fresh, delicious and not overly sweet! They refrigerate well as well and retain its moistness a few days later."

I was not a big fan of the lemon or maple walnut. It is very rich.The place is small but near bars/restaurants so it is perfect to grab a bite of dessert after dinner. There isn't much seating.

The day of the class the bakery called us to let us know that we would not be allowed to take the class even though he'd already paid and reserved it more than a month in advance. They said that another customer brought two extra people and they would be cancelling our reservation to make room. Not only did they cancel our reservation last minute, they also said they could not reschedule us for over a month. Incredibly unprofessional and disappointing as it was too late for him to sign up for another class elsewhere."

We were yelled at to put our masks on. My daughters already had their masks on upon entering and I immediately complied and put mine on. We paid for our bite sized cupcakes and the woman just walked away. No thank you, no have a nice day, nothing. She was just so hostile for no reason. Maybe she didn't like that my daughters were half Asian. Avoid this place."

947,qMr-lz0G0vyz2r4mJJQxmA,5/3/2022,4 star rating,"My friend and I did the cupcake making class here and it was a good time! When we went it was 3 stations with 2 people at each station and each station is in charge of one flavor. There was vanilla, Chocolate, and Banana, we were at the vanilla station which was the most basic recipe so i do wish  we had something a little different but turned out nice. I thought the teacher did a good job juggling the fact that we all had slightly different recipes and stopping by each station to make sure she was showing us those steps that may be unique to us. Why the cupcakes cook for about 24 min they do send you away to get a coffee or something, I do wish instead of sending us a away they had something for us to do there or drinks for us there or something but its not a long amount of time so not to big. When we came back why the cupcakes are cooling each station makes 2 different flavor frosting and then we all got 3 of each flavor cupcakes and swapped the frostings so we could mix and match the flavors and frostings. Definitely a fun event to do with a friend!"

I was towards the end bumping elbows with the cashier constantly. Space issues aside, the baking lesson was informative, as we made vanilla, chocolate, and banana cupcakes with several different types of frosting. All the baking materials are already measured, so not much influence you yourself can put on the product until the very end (decoration/icing the cakes). In the end you get 9 cupcakes to take home, though our cakes seemed really dry (you're not the ones who put it on the oven). Icing is solid however.Our teacher was really nice and went to everyone to make sure things were being made correctly. If you're going to do the class, see if you can get one which isn't full"

When I looked it up, I was really curious what an icing shot was which was free with a Yelp check-in.There were so many variety of cupcakes that I really did have to have one. I chose the chocolate cupcake topped with strawberry buttercream. Both the cupcake and the icing was not overly sweet at all. Yummilicious!Their best seller is the salted caramel with chocolate so I got that for the icing shot. Really good!For those who live in the city, they offer baking classes where they also share the recipe. Love that they do not add food coloring to their icing. All natural from the fruit!"
950,qMr-lz0G0vyz2r4mJJQxmA,3/1/2019,4 star rating,"This bakery specializes in cupcakes with buttercream frosting. I came here after purchasing a cupcake baking class through Groupon. It was super easy to select the class time through their online scheduling portal.If you check into Yelp, you can get a free shot of frosting. I chose the expresso one which was very yummy - Lovely, strong coffee taste. I arrived a few minutes late to the class, but was welcomed in the group. The shop is pretty small, but there was surprisingly enough room for the class toward the back. It helped that there weren't too many people (around 6 students and 1 instructor) since it was a week night. Our instructor, Matt was awesome! He was engaging, funny, knowledgeable about baking - he did a wonderful job explaining the process, and answered all questions with ease. We started off with making two different flavored bases: Chocolate and vanilla. I helped with pouring the ingredients in and used a mixer to blend everything together. While the cupcakes were baking, we created 4 different flavors of buttercream frosting: Peanut butter chocolate, cookies and cream, vanilla and chocolate. The cookies and cream was super easy to make... We just used the mixer to add oreos to the vanilla butter cream. I am not really a fan of oreos plain, but as a frosting it tasted amazing! That and the peanut buttter chocolate were my favorites, but all of the flavors were super rich and delicious. I really enjoyed the process of making the frosting and loved seeing it become perfectly creamy and thick. The cupcakes came out fluffy and moist. Matt showed us how to add the frosting with a metal spatula-like tool. It looked a bit difficult to do, especially if you wanted to add the signature swirl that Butter Lane cupackes has. When I first tried, the entirety of the frosting plopped onto the top of the cupcake becuase it was still warm from the oven. Ideally, you want to wait until they cool off. However, affter the initial flop, I actually got the hang of it and Matt praised me, saying that I have talent! What a nice compliment! We had oreo cookies and colorful sprinkles as toppings. It was a ton of fun to go through the whole process of baking cupcakes and as an added bonus we got to take home 9 cupcakes and eat 1 in class because it was such a small group. Even after we took so many, there was still some left over! I definitely recommend trying this class out or just stop by to enjoy one of their delightful cupcakes."

I say this because east Harlem can get a little crazy. The only thing I would beware of is their fountain machine. The drinks are either too sweet or too watery.

Nice counter staff. Plus, they were playing 80's metal when I stumbled in here the other night. Winning!Nothing better than to soak up all the cheap booze I just drowned my liver in than a bunch of cheap bean burritos, hard shell tacos, gorditas, and cinnamon twists.

To top it all off, my order came without my side of lava sauce, and without my Doritos. Took about 20 minutes, maybe more, before I got my ""fast"" food, and I was pretty much the only person in the store. I walked home (5 min) and unwrapped my food, of course, all of it was cold, lukewarm at best. I'll be going back since they're the only taco bell around.Edit: After further examining the food, I'd like to add that the crunch wrap supreme had no melted cheese in it, and the 5 layer burrito was nearly empty, it was basically just a roll of bread with a little (emphasis on ""little"") beef and sour cream inside it.

Reminded me why I love oysters so much. Just take a look at those juicy beauties. I loved both entrees we ordered - the spaghetti and clams (saw this one on almost every table) and the baked halibut. Spaghetti was al dente, perfect level of chewiness and the tomato gravy on top was thick and hearty. A nice twist of the typical spaghetti vongole but with red sauce. Would love to try to recreate this at home. The halibut was so soft and flaky. Really liked the veggies underneath - bok choy, zucchini, and eggplant - but would have liked to see a bit more veggies for a $40 dish. Spicy cucumbers were good and pickled, but a tiny portion.

994,mPOa5FLgjWrK3k6yxBGQnw,5/22/2021,4 star rating,"On one of the most beautiful Saturdays in recent memory, my best friend and I hit up The Clam, which I had saved down in my memory bank for over two years after eating at EN across the street. I'm not sure why it has stuck around for some long, maybe I have a soft spot for places with cute signage (rest in peace, Rossopomodoro).  Overall, food was excellent, drinks less so. If I were to come here again, I'd just stick with the wine options, because the cocktails were kind of meh. I went with the Bird from Peru with pisco and supposedly pineapple and lemon but I couldn't taste much of anything. It was a little like drinking vaguely alcohol-flavored water. My friend's Alpine Stroll at Dawn with gin and green tea shochu was the total opposite, where it was like getting smacked in the face with rubbing alcohol. Oysters were plump, nicely shucked. Reminded me why I love oysters so much. Just take a look at those juicy beauties. I loved both entrees we ordered - the spaghetti and clams (saw this one on almost every table) and the baked halibut. Spaghetti was al dente, perfect level of chewiness and the tomato gravy on top was thick and hearty. A nice twist of the typical spaghetti vongole but with red sauce. Would love to try to recreate this at home. The halibut was so soft and flaky. Really liked the veggies underneath - bok choy, zucchini, and eggplant - but would have liked to see a bit more veggies for a $40 dish. Spicy cucumbers were good and pickled, but a tiny portion. Service was fine, all business. Next time - want to try the clam dip with the potato chips, the chowder, and the sliders."

After many years of eating here - I can say for sure - one of the best restaurants in the city - and a fair value too. enjoy!"

999,mPOa5FLgjWrK3k6yxBGQnw,12/18/2022,4 star rating,"The food here is good.  However, we had a 9:15pm reservation (on a Friday night) and when we made the reservation we were not told that the kitchen closes at 9:45pm.  If the kitchen is closing in 30 mins, a restaurant should not take reservations in NY.  We were rushed into putting our orders in, we didn't have the opportunity to add additional items, and as we're still enjoying dinner, they were putting chairs up around us.  I had been to The Clam pre-pandemic and I don't recall them closing down this early. I would recommend going to The Clam during the week but It's not a place I would revisit on the weekends, where the expectation is that you will be having a late night."
1000,mPOa5FLgjWrK3k6yxBGQnw,11/6/2021,4 star rating,I had to get the clam dishes since we were at a place called the Clam. I started with the Clam Chowder and it was delicious. I had the Spaghetti with Clams in red sauce and it was very good as well. I prefer angel hair pasta but that was not an option. The pasta is homemade. We also had string beans were good and carrots were ok. The music is too loud to have a conversation. They did separate checks which was nice.

I ordered the Wall Street breakfast sandwich. When I ate it, there was no tomato in it. There literally three ingredients: eggs, cheese, and tomato... why is this so hard to remember? It's extremely annoying paying $7.60 and being let down.I don't know what to say. This company should pay its employees more and give them an incentive to be more diligent."
1007,ohgo7IDUn5bOWnDJP9xvYQ,12/11/2022,1 star rating,"I am not the type to leave reviews, nonetheless negative review, but I was absolutely appalled at my experience today. The first red flag were flies near the bagel baskets, and in the store. My friend and I placed an order while the store was mildly busy at best (maybe 2 or 3 people behind us). We ordered 2 bagels and made our way to take a seat and wait. After 25 minutes go by and the line has lengthened, I asked the cashier if there was any update on our order, as we've been waiting almost 30 minutes for 2 bagels, and was told it would be ""just a minute"". After another 5-8 minutes go by, my friend asks again for some clarification of what's going on, and this time the cashier shrugs his shoulder and says he does not know. At this point, I noticed them laughing at us. By the 45 minute mark, I ask again what is going on and how it is genuinely possible that the entire store filled and cleared out, and we still have yet to received 2 bagels. Again, I was given absolutely not explanation, sense of urgency or help in the slightest. We ended up with no bagels and asked for a refund. I've never in my life experienced such atrocious costumer service in my life. I will never be coming back."

Super guys, funny we had a lot of fun I am sure of it. Value: Oh, I have no idea I don't remember paying so thank goodness I took a photo of the menu. Just kidding, It was a fair exchange and near our hotel. Full disclosure: We visited The Flame twice, kind of a NYC deja vu kind of thing I guess...

It always is fresh and hits the spot. The hamburgers are excellent, too. There is no need to go to one of those trendy, crowded burger  joints when The Flame serves ''em up so delicious. I order mine medium rare and the last one I got was cooked perfectly.  The French fries were excellent, too, honestly.... Thin like McDonald's but better.

Solid wifi. Solid amount of outlets. Great ambiance. Love the vibe. Blues playing in the background was great. The barista was friendly and attractive in a heroin-chic-Cher type of way. They get four stars instead of five because they don't take credit cards and it's 2014. If they start taking cards I'll update this rating to a 5 star.

I tried this place for the first time on Cinco de Mayo day. Saw a few people in line and wanted to give it a try. We ordered 2 frozen regular margaritas. They were okay. Also Buffalo wings to go. They were also not bad. So my first experience was okay. I tried it second time on a Saturday for frozen margarita again and this time the margaritas tasted better. Because of Coronavirus they serve right at the window. It was quick and easy. The guy to brought the check was nice. I am a vegetarian so of course they don't have much for me but everyday they have specials of rum punch $5, and frozen margarita for $8 which is not bad. I buy with the same price at other places too."
1054,n-h-MBr0L1S4iilrOXETLg,3/4/2020,2 star rating,"I've visited Dillinger's multiple times since I moved to Astoria over 12 years ago but I was somewhat disappointed with my last visit on 25 cent wing night (Tuesday). Just a note that they offer 25 cent wings but there are a thousand fine prints, not all flavor of wings are part of the special, and they even charge you for the sauce which comes in a tiny cup. This isn't something new and it's not part of my complaint, I just wanted everyone to be aware of all restrictions and extras. I just hope they don't start charging for napkins and to use the restrooms. I totally understand people need to drink so the restaurant can make money because if people go there, eat 20 wings and drink water, they would end up spending a little over 10 bucks. But my friends and I always drink a lot of beer, we order multiple pitchers of beers and our bill is always 80% drinks / 20% food. But last night the waiters were very systematic. We were in a group of 5, we ordered a pitcher for 4 of us and one person ordered a bottled beer. Since we drink a lot, by the time the waiter came to take our food order, we ordered a second pitcher and also ordered a total of 30 wings (10 bbq, 10 buffalo, 10 hot garlic because garlic parmesan wasn't included in the special). In my opinion, ordering 30 wings for 5 people is a reasonable number to start, 6 wings each. But the waiter said he had to check if we were eligible to order 30 wings based on the number of drinks we had ordered so far. He ended up bringing the wings, and after drinking 2 other pitchers plus another bottled beer, we decided to order 20 more wings and, once again, the waiter said he had to check inside. We felt as if the restaurant was doing us a favor by giving us wings (which we were paying for).Dillinger's management, if you know how to do basic math you will see that we had 6 pitchers of beer for 4 people, (1.5 pitcher per person) and one person had 2 bottled beers. I, myself drank one and a half pitcher of beer alone. So can I have 10 wings? (50 wings for 5 people). Or is it too much to ask?Stop complicating things, I will definitely think twice before going back. If you can't keep selling wings for 25 cents just increase the price to 50 cents and treat customers better. I would definitely pay 5 dollars for 10 wings if I didn't have to almost beg to be served. Our bill was over 150 bucks total so as you can see we did spend money!(Note to other fellow Yelpers. Check other reviews and sort them by most recent and you will see multiple 1 star reviews with the same complaints about the greedy owner. Apparently this place is going downhill. The 4 star review average is probably from years ago when there wasn't a lot of BS)"

My favorite is the boneless bites, burger night and steak night! The $10 skirt steak on wednesdays is amazing! The flavor you will not find anywhere else! The burgers are $5 on Thursdays I believe, and they too are AMAZING!!!!! Came in here the other night and havent been in a while, still consistent!! This is one of the best places around and they have been around for a very long time. The only thing that was not good according to my husband was the chicken philly cheesesteak. He said that was bland and he wouldn't get that again."

In order to get the steak for $10, you have to order something else from the menu for at least $10. One of my friends and I decided to share the steak and also ordered the Stuffed Chicken Special which was approximately $14. The waiter took our order without a problem and our steak came out in a timely manner. However, when we were served the steak, the owner informed us in a rude tone of voice and manner that the Stuffed Chicken does not count toward the $10 steak deal and we will be charged the full amount for the steak. I asked him where this was written and he just pointed to the page detailing the steak special, which did not indicate that specials are not included in the deal. I then let him know we didn't want the stuffed chicken and that we would pick something else. He replied that the stuffed chicken was almost done being made. How convenient. It would have been nice if we were told this ahead of time. Instead of making this into a bigger issue, my friend graciously said she would purchase something to go so that we could get the $10 steak. Since we were forced to spend more money, the steak special was no longer a good deal. The owner was not sympathetic at all, but the waiter at least apologized for the confusion. That being said, the damage was already done and though there are different deals for brunch and each day of the week, I already made up my mind that I won't be returning. The food was decent though. The steak didn't come with any sauce or sides, but was still quite tasty. It was huge with crispy onion on top. We could definitely tell that the steak had been marinated and it was extremely flavorful, though a bit dry and tough. I also got to try the appetizer of french fries with melted cheddar, bacon and sour cream. This was really good. Delightful fluffy fries with great potato flavor, crispy bacon, melty cheese and plenty of sour cream.My friend and I shared the Stuffed Chicken, which I think was even better than the steak. The chicken was stuffed with cheese and had a white mushroom sauce accompanying it. There were also mashed potatoes and broccoli, carrots and green beans. The sauce was deliciously creamy, filled with great flavor and worked perfectly with the juicy and tender chicken. The mashed potato and vegetables were yummy as well."

Threw it in the trash. Based on that- I wouldn't ever try this place again. If that's the representation of their food. It tasted soiled but they tried to save the meat with like vinegar or something. Not even sure it was meat."

Having grown up very close to Buffalo I thought I should give the wings a try. I got the moderately priced 18 piece, medium hotness, and I also got the house salad. I showed up and was greeted very kindly by a staff member. Food was ready to be picked up the moment I got there, and I was on my way.The wings were absolutely perfect. Jumbo style with just the right amount of kick. The house salad was also exceptionally good for a pub. Really good Caesar dressing.I'm so happy I gave this place a try. I will most definitely be ordering from here again. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!"

For example, the gluten-free bun is toasted to perfection and buttered. Now for the food. For starters, we got the onion rings which were fried to perfection, not overly greasy and just excellent, they came with this awesome zingy sauce. We also got the sweet potato wedges which were great, but the dipping sauce was the real star. It was like a sesame-based sauce (think techina), but next level, I honestly wanted to buy a big one to take home.For mains we got the Nashville sandwich. The ""chick'n"" was excellent, I mean it was like a chicken burger-it tasted somewhat like chicken, and was delicious in its own right. It is hot as advertised.  Drink-wise, she got the gold rush and liked it. I got the Mockingbird, it was excellent, heavy on the blackberry, and was blue and pretty. The decor was millennial, nice and brilliant, definitely a great setting for a romantic date, or really anything. The only criticism I have, is our food did take some time to come out-there really was at most 2 other dining parties in the restaurant, but the waitress was great and took care of us. It really wasn't a big deal. Overall, it is an awesome restaurant and I really want to go back to try more things on the menu and have the experience a second time."

Lots of florals and PINK.Service is great; there are servers in training but they are super friendly and nice. But the food here was really nothing special..

All the dishes seemed to like flavor/seasoning. The tots were probably the best part of the meal.Service: 5/5Our server was simply amazing! They greeted us with a smile and THE best energy! We are those type of people that sit down chat and don't look at the menu until like 20 mins in. But they were super accommodating and told us to take our time. I always love when servers give reccs or their personal favorites. The drink suggested I loved! We came at a time where their shift was ending and they came up to us and let us know that our server would be changing. We were so impressed! It was such a simple gesture but I've never had someone say that to me before, very kind!Vibe: 5/5We came here for Sunday brunch and this place is super cute! Very instagrammable. Walking down the street, you can see the grass sign with Thyme & tonic! The pink aesthetic is everything. The inside is spacious as well as the outdoor seating. They also have paper menus which was surprising LOL only because I'm used to the QR codes but it was refreshing. IMO you're solely paying for the vibe here & maybe the drinks!Overall, I would come here again but only for drinks and the vibe if they have a happy hour but the food is not that great IMO. The service and vibe really carried this rating but the food was really lacking so it's not quite giving 4 stars."

But we were able to snag a table during brunch after just a short wait. Their cocktails are creative and pretty, and their menu is perfect for both vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters. We ordered the Philly cheese steak (vegan) and vegan tofu Reuben. The Reuben was delicious, and I loved the pickled tofu and the bread was thick and crispy with the sauerkraut. The cheese steak was pretty dry, and not nearly as flavorful as we would've hoped. The service was somewhat slow because of the crowdedness, but all in all a good meal."

There definitely are a lot of tourists, so be prepared for a lot of bulky bags. Luckily we were able to be seated right away and the waitress was super friendly and attentive, which is (obviously) not super common in touristy areas.My boyfriend did not realize it was mainly plant based, but luckily the the waitress made sure that we knew before we ordered. This actually completely changed his order as he thought the chick'n sandwich would actually be chicken. I, of course, studied the Yelp page on the ride over and saw a bunch of great reviews on the Chick'n Sandwich so I ordered it anyway. He took a bite and said he was happy the waitress told him but I really enjoyed it, even as someone who often eats chicken. He got the coconut pancakes and really enjoyed them.We ordered the specialty drinks of the day, which were delicious and should be on the summer menu. The waitress could not have been more friendly. I'd definitely want to come back with some friends for a low-key brunch!"

It did a good job on some things but failed to deliver on others. The price is up there so the experience overall fell a little short on my expectations.I had the dumplings as an appetizer and the Diablo burger as an entree with sweet potato wedges. The dumplings were pretty good and I recommend them. As for the entree, despite the name of the burger (Diablo) it didn't have any kick to it and you couldn't really taste any jalapeños. The bun and burger in general were quite dry and the flavor was lacking, it really was pretty bland overall. The sweet potato wedges are very mushy and have absolutely no crisp to them at all, so they don't really pair well with a burger (or with anything I can think of).Maybe I just ordered the wrong things but for the price I was really expecting something much better than I received. The drinks and appetizers were pretty good though."

Nothing was super overpriced if we're talking Manhattan pricing. I wasn't blown away by the food and I left still kind of hungry, which is why I gave 4 stars. If you're looking for a solid vegan-friendly restaurant, come here for their brunch! One other disappointing thing was how almost all their options were soy-based; I'm allergic to soy, so that eliminated almost all the options for me and with so many plant-based proteins out there I was hoping they would have something non-soy based, but alas. FOOD:Vegan lox (5/5) - I've personally never seen vegan lox and this one was made of carrots. It definitely didn't taste like salmon but I really liked the smoky flavor they gave to the carrot. I was impressed!Giant latke (3/5) - nothing special, and in terms of sustenance there wasn't quite enough food to really satisfy. Bravas omelette (3.5/5) - the salsas were delicious and definitely stole the show on this one. The omelette itself was underwhelming, as it was just patatas wrapped in egg. The bread was also good though."
1067,Uvb04kXjHJgIzxi2iroyQw,1/4/2023,2 star rating,"Simply no... food was in between bad and mediocre and prices were too high given the lack of actual meat. I've had some really delicious vegan/vegetarian restaurants in the past but this one was a no. Ahi burger lacked flavor throughout. The buffalo popcorn chick'n was soggy with zero crunch whatsoever + drenched way too heavily with buffalo sauce. Only decent item was Parmesan truffle fries but that's honestly difficult to mess up anyway. Food also came out extremely slowly, like 30-45 minutes. Would not come back again."

Its also gluten free with fish and  numerous vegetarian meals for all to enjoy.I started with incredibly yummy squash soup. The flavors were delightful. It had Tahiti sauce added which I felt was very creative and a perfect party in my mouth.  My entrée was salmon burger with all the fixings. It was complemented with some fresh salad the avocado which was exceptionally creamy with a tasty aioli sauce. The bread was amazing fresh and warm it went fantastic with the salmon. I had a gluten free beer called blonde is was very refreshing it went perfectly with my food. My hubby started off with off with matzo ball soup. He said it was good however a bit salty.  He went to have fish  tacos he stated it was delish. The fish was tender with excellent seasoning along with a substantial taco shell. He had a cocktail call love potion, he expressed it was a fabulous drink. The restaurant did not offer any desserts so that would be my recommendation to them.

He was basically yelling at us after a friend was definitely coming later- we told him exactly how late, and that she was fine to stand. This still warranted shouting by him.  Really unbelievable.-had seriously THE worst rice noodle dish here. Completely overcooked and floppy noodles, again overpowered by acid. I'm getting an ulcer just talking about this, too!  I completely get that I was taking a risk by ordering an ethnic dish at a ""plant -based restaurant"", but truly this was abominable.

It wasn't the best burger I've ever had (pretty average to be honest), but it was a cute lil place with good service and good vibes. It's a very solid burger though, and if you're ever in the area, it might be a good option. Depending on what time you go though, it might be difficult to find seating, and the seating is pretty tight and cosy. I wouldn't be opposed to coming back if someone else suggested it, but I live a bit far and wouldn't find myself back there of my own accord."
1071,8XLhXJcJ2XbQ8dTBY9YyQg,5/16/2022,4 star rating,"""Cash is trash."" -- Ray DalioThis quotation means something different than how I'm using it here (it refers to not letting your cash just sit in a low interest savings account as inflation pounds away at it's true worth). Still, it's a good entry point into Corner Bistro's simple, no-frills, ""old-fashioned"" approach, including its intentional (and annoying) resistance to things like credit card machines. It's 2022! (Yes, I know Mastercard/Visa/Amex/Discover are shameless, fee-seeking middlemen who pass that cost onto the consumer, but honestly, ""time is money,"" and having to get cash is annoying enough that I'm willing to pay $2 extra not to have to do it. Hopefully, when Solana Pay comes around, Corner Bistro rethinks this aversion to 1950s technology.)Anyway... the charm of Corner Bistro is that they barely do much to their burger, and it's one of the few things on the menu. You can order either a ""mini"" version or you can go for the full version, which is like a 1/3 pounder. *** I did the full version and added a portobello mushroom. I'd describe the burger as ""serviceably excellent."" Did I think it was transcendent? No. Was it like nothing I'd ever tasted (in a good way, not like poop)? No. Did I go, ""WHOAAAAAA"" after eating it? No. But it wasn't mediocre, either. The beef is well-sourced, juicy (get medium rare and stick to your guns if they try to push you up), and the focus is on the beef, not condiments or seasoning that I find often is an attempt to handwave you away from the quality of second-tier beef. I'm a big proponent of letting meat speak for itself, and I get suspicious when people start putting too much stuff on a burger or a steak. ""Some"" have criticized the patty for being a bit too lumpy -- less a well-shaped and crafted patty than a lump of ground beef passed off as a burger. I get this critique. It's hard to hold the burger, and it can fall apart (well, at least the full-size one). Ultimately, though, I didn't think it affected the flavor much, and as you know, I'm a substance not form guy.Seating is run-down gastropub-ish and also with outdoor option. The obvious comp here is JG Melon. I'd put them about even. If you go in and don't expect something paradigm busting, you'll have a great time.*** An earlier version of this review stated in error that the two people I went with -- my friend Johnny A. (commissioner of my fantasy basketball league) and Rinat B. (his partner) -- ordered a mini version of the burger. It also mocked Johnny A.'s ability to eat large quantities of meat and referenced his having to split a prime rib at Keens. In fact, he and Rinat B. both ordered the FULL burger. We at MC3 regret the error."

Nice change of pace to have lunch in an old school bar and grill (not sure why they call it a bistro?) that seems to have survived amid the fancier cafes and bistros popping up all over this West Village neighborhood.Cash only. A small food and drink menu hangs on the wall. The sound of Sinatra and other crooners is on the sound system and a game is playing on the TVs in the bar area. There are three seating options: the bar room, back room, and outdoor covered area.Food is served on paper plates and beer is in bottles or plastic cups. The burgers are a la carte and we ordered a plate of fries (shoestring style) to share at the table. Everything was very simple and good, but not great.We ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and Cheeseburger, but the food wasn't memorable, just the atmosphere. Service was just fine. I wouldn't necessarily call this a cheap option, with the burger at $13.75 and chicken at $12.75, but certainly less than a fancy lunch down the street.It definitely feels like a neighborhood spot and with grilled cheese and a mini version of the burger on the menu, we weren't surprised to see a children's birthday party taking place."

It's got kind of a dive bar feel, but it's definitely of higher quality than a dive, both in terms of food and drink. They have quite a good craft beer list, had several I had never had before. I ordered the cheeseburger, which was quite tasty, though it did fall apart kind of easily, so I'd make sure you get silverware. The burgers also don't come with sides just FYI, we ordered some tots, which were good. The main thing to remember is that it's cash only, so come prepared. Also they only sit you once your whole party is there. Not a big deal, you can just hang at the bar while you wait. It's just south of 14th st, in West Village, so there's plenty else to do in the area. I'd definitely recommend checking it out if you find yourself down there."

Breads is well-maintained and kept clean--all their baked goods are displayed neatly. definitely worth a stop if you're in the Union Square area and need to upgrade the carbs you're consuming. very hard to go wrong at Breads"

JFK's Terminal 5 has a variety of restaurants and bar options.Revolucion is located between Gates 11 and 12, a bit off the beaten path so it wasn't too crowded. I got a seat at the bar and ordered the Santa Fe salad ($18). Like any airport restaurant Revolucion is pricey, however food was very fresh and portion sizes were large. The salad included grilled chicken, pico de gallo, a bean and corn salsa plus guacamole and a few tortilla chips. Compared to other Yelp reviews the food was better than my initial expectations. In addition to food they have a full bar offering many cocktails, beers & wine.My server was really nice, but the service was a little slow. At the time only one server was working and she seemed a little overwhelmed. However, if you aren't rushing to your flight I'd recommend dining (or getting a drink) at Revolucion.

That's the only plus) and drinks then ignored us for 30mins or more?! So we went to the bar to pay, and got our entrees elsewhere.  This is an AIRPORT. People generally don't have over half an hour to wait just to put an order in let alone wait to receive said entree. Ridiculous."

Well if knives can come out of her blue eyes, she replied to me that she couldn't hear me with that thing on my face;referring to my mask. She demanded me to remove my mask and I refuse to remove my mask. Her reply was oh well. So  I reply to her if this restaurant was non-compliance with regulations on cov19.

It was as hard as a hockey puck and flavorless. The pita seemed even old and hard. My friend had the chicken salad and was disappointed as well since it had no flavor at all. This place was very slow and that is always a sign of business. I'm usually very very good about checking yelp reviews before going into a place but another person who was with me said she's been here before and we should go. I trusted her because Sheepshead is her neighborhood and not mine. Never again will I believe someone else's word without checking Yelp reviews therefore I would never return here if I was dying of hunger and in Sheepshead.

Fortunately, there is Kouros Bay Diner, which isn't too far off on Nostrand Avenue. Kouros Bay is a small diner and it seems like it is mostly frequented by elders in the neighborhood. When I first sat down, I immediately noticed the excellent service. We were escorted to a table and given menus as soon as we entered the diner. During our meal, we were approached multiple times by the waiter and waitress checking on our status. The friendly, home feel of the restaurant definitely gave us a good feeling.Unfortunately, where the diner exceled in customer service, they lacked in food quality. As much as I wanted to like what we ordered, I was disappointed in the food. We ordered a Mushroom Burger with Fries and a Corned Beef Hash with Home Fries and Eggs. The Mushroom Burger lacked flavor and freshness. It was quite bland. The fries were soft and not hot/warm. The Onion Ring in the burger was not crunchy either. Despite the fact that they are a diner, I expected a better burger still. As for the breakfast dish we ordered, that was better. The Corned Beef Hash was not bad and the Home Fries and Eggs were cooked better. It's usually hard to screw up the breakfast dish, but I'm never one to be surprised.I wanted so hard to like Kouros Bay Diner because of the friendly service, but the food was such a letdown. I will say that I'm going to give them another try and I hope the next time the food will prove me wrong about them!"

I ordered food via UberEats, and waited for 30 minutes to get my food. I specifically ordered it very spicy, and emphasized this when placing the order. I was sadly disappointed.The food was not spicy at all. And the taste was off. I had some of the chicken pieces, as well as the rice. But the taste was not good, and the aftertaste was worse. I actually felt like gagging after, so I tossed the leftover rather than save them for a future meal.These folks need to up their game. If they advertise their food as spicy, or offer that option when ordering, they need to comply with that. Someone here was not paying attention to detail when putting my order together.I can't say that I'll be ordering from here again, as there are far better options when it comes to chicken tiki masala.

They have an A grade for sanitary inspection. If you come here, don't expect quality service. This is a type of dine out/take away place. They don't serve you & it's order from the counter deal anyway. I always get the Tikka Masala, Mango Lassi & the Squash as a side dish. It costs $13 overall. Run to this place if you want good Indian food : )"

I ordered online as usual and showed up at the time to pick Up. The woman there began questioning me and told me that my order wasn't placed. She repeatedly asked me my name and said that I ordered from a different restaurant. I showed her my emailed receipt to prove that I was at the right place then she ""found"" my order. I had to wait another 20 minutes while they prepared my food.Today, I gave them another shot and ordered online again. This time I gave them an extra 5 minutes just to make sure they receive it. Sure enough the same woman made me show her my email with my name on it because they received nothing. After reading what I ordered, they BEGAN to prepare my food. I support my local businesses and would have loved to support this spot, but 2 times out of the 3 they have failed me. Unfortunately I'll have to look for Indian food elsewhere."

I had it delivered through eatstreet and it arrived within 30 minutes.I ordered a small chicken 65, plain naan, and a mango lassi. The order also comes with a salad on the house. The portions were pretty good for the entree and the bread was huge  mango lassi was a solid win as wellTaste wise I was definitely satisfied and I'd probably order from them again! Just a couple points down for oiliness."

Second, chicken was uncooked, we got a stomach pain when we were eating.... I complained about chicken. And asked bill.Owner didn't remembered our order. We ordered only each 1 combo and 1 chicken kabob but I think they charged 2 of combo. Of course they didn't change chicken kabob. Just 1 star place for me"

Unfortunately, a sign indicates they are temporarily closed for a family emergency (I hope everything is OK), so I decided to come across the street to Curry King.Urdu on the facade suggests Pakistani ownership, although the woman at the counter only spoke Bengali..In either case, the chai was good, but the aloo paratha was just vaise-vaise (mediocre). It was thickly stuffed with aloo mash that was well seasoned and flavorful, but a bit too thick, even with some potato skin still left on. I can't say I was the biggest fan."

1164,BMB9m2jp7RXgrIcCEAmQJQ,7/9/2021,5 star rating,"This place is my childhood. My grandma used to take me here in the city and bring back 10 egg tarts because I loved them so much! To this day, these egg tarts still succeed in their delicious flavor, melt in your mouth taste, and reminder of my childhood. Their dan tats/egg tarts are classic -- buttery puff pastry crust outside, milky egg tart within. The pastry can honestly melt in your mouth and it can be difficult to hold onto it since it melts so easily. The bakery is self-service trays right now similar to 85deg Bakery. They're also cash only like most asian bakeries so make sure to bring cash!"

1166,BMB9m2jp7RXgrIcCEAmQJQ,3/16/2021,3 star rating,"Great selection of bread options for breakfast, lunch, or an afternoon snack!- Tuna bread: first off, the outside of this bread is beautiful! The swirly crust is evident of the fluffy pull-apart milk bread texture. The filling on the other hand was disappointing, I thought there would be some tuna mayo action going on, but it just tuna and some onions. I recommend mixing in a bit of kewpie mayo if you're eating this at home so it's not as dry.- Wife cake: more on the dry side, very flaky pastry but not enough filling to balance it out. If you prefer smooth winter melon filling, note that there are a few sugared melon chunks in theirs.- Egg Tart: classic egg tart from Chinese bakeries, can't go wrong with this- Coconut Raisin Bread Loaf - this was my favorite. Don't expect to use this as sandwich bread though because it will fall apart on you. The loaf itself is constructed from braided twists to layer in all the sweet coconut flake toppings. This is the Asian alternative (and I dare say an even better one) to the cinnamon raisin loaves you'll find in American grocery stores."

Their almond croissant is unbelievably delicious! It's buttery, soft, and full of almond goodness. I'm not a huge fan of croissants, but this was exceptional! I will definitely get this next time I go to Pret A Manger. Their iced coffee is surprisingly good and strong. There's nothing like sipping on a black, strong iced coffee at the moment you need a coffee IV. It really hits you hard.

By far the worst customer service we experienced in New York City.  Malik, the person at the register and Joseph the manager needs training on customer service.

I picked up a few other items and went to pay. I informed the cashier about the tuna and she stared at me for a split second before putting her head down and not saying anything.

The seaweed wrap is surprisingly good; It has quinoa and avocado, which I would have never imagined in a tortilla wrap. Once in a while, they run out of brewed coffee in the morning and then there is this chaos among customers, that includes me, and quite funny actually.

All of these are worth picking up sometime. I almost shed a tear when they discontinued the shrimp wrap for awhile, but finally they got their senses back and it's back now. The seaweed wrap is surprisingly good; It has quinoa and avocado, which I would have never imagined in a tortilla wrap. Once in a while, they run out of brewed coffee in the morning and then there is this chaos among customers, that includes me, and quite funny actually. But they're usually very quick about bringing out a new batch or they upgrade your regular coffee for any other coffee of your choice on the menu. The staff here are nice and friendly. They always comment on my outfit in the morning, lol. Thanks!"

1213,ZrHG1_Owb87mSmTU63kTPg,9/11/2019,4 star rating,"I find their style of pizza very interesting. It's not quite super thin crust, it's definitely thin crust, and I would almost describe it is the opposite of Original Ray's Famous Pizza. The cheese they use is not as pillowy, the dough is crispy not soft, and they put herbs and spices on every slice.  That's actually the marquee difference between Gotham Pizza and all others.  I actually like that there's very little crust on their pizza so you don't end up just eating bread at the end of your slice. It's served hot, so let it cool lest you get a brunt-roof-Of-the-mouth situation where the skin comes off over the next few days- and what do you do with that skin?  Spit it out?  Eat it?  I mean it's already in your mouth.  Is it weird to eat your mouth?  To eat part of your mouth?I highly recommend this joint, it's good pizza for a fair price and stylistically it's very much it's own. Unique, delicious pizza.  I think they do their name justice. T.J. (The original yelp gangster)"

It felt like the heat was on, and there was very little air inside. You go to the counter and order what you want, and it's usually whatever pizzas you see in the front that are already made. We got one slice of pepperoni and one slice of buffalo chicken. We sat and waited for our order, and the chairs and tables seemed pretty messy and dirty. In a few minutes, our pizzas were ready. For the pepperoni pizza, it was very oily in my opinion and there was so much grease and fat coming from it. I like that the crust was pretty thin, but it was not crunchy at all because it was soaked in the oil and cheese. The buffalo chicken tasted better, but again, the thin crust was soggy."

So you'll definitely might need to have two slices Just keep in mind during lunch time the place is packed especially with the high school kids and they don't rush to leave the place at all so you might not get setting at that time or you have to wait.

The bathrooms are graffiti ridden.  Midway, excels in this regard.  Where Midway excels the best is in service and a friendly atmosphere.  It can get busy, especially on weekends but the bartenders are experts at serving everyone in proper order even if there are 27 people who think they're next.  Jeanette, Sunday, Emily and Mary are great!  Sorry if I missed anyone.  Give this place a shot and I promise, you won't be let down.  Ciao, fellow alcoholics and barflies."

Walked in and there were about 4 people at the bar who seems to be having a good time by how loud they were...lol! Have all the fun! Anywho, we sat at a table and ordered about 5 mins after that.

First, I must commend Joel behind the bar for being so patient with me and recommending an amazing combination. I got the black iron burger with bacon and the herb garlic fries. It was prepared quickly and I wanted to go home and eat it but the smell coming out of the bag forced me to eat in the carThe burger was soooo juicy and the flavors worked really well together. I was a little skeptical about the horseradish mayo combined with the stout caramelized onions but they were both mild enough that nothing was overpowered. I got started on the fries after the burger and I was full because the burger was very filling on its own but I could not stop eating. The garlic herb description is ACCURATE. You can see the seasoning, you can smell it and you can taste it. To top it off, I had to go back because I didn't have a bottle opener and Joel was nice enough to teach me how to open a bottle without an opener .

We got there around 1pm and were able to be seated right away. The ambiance is simple and nice, there were a few seats outside but we opted for indoors, our server was nice and helpful, I had a beer and my wife had a mojito. There are a few burger and sandwich items on the menu but we opted to create our own burgers, there are many topping options that you pay for individually. The burgers don't come with fries so we ordered the garlic herb fries and it was big enough to share. Our order came out fast and all the food was really fresh, fries were nice and crispy and tasty without being salty, the burgers were actually cooked at medium how we ordered them, while we enjoyed this place it can be a little pricey and I dislike not including any side with the burger at these prices however this takes nothing away from the quality of the food."
1237,Q39xJvqJaM1xgDka8bQ80w,2/4/2020,5 star rating,"Black Iron Burger has quickly become my go-to place in the downtown section of Brooklyn for burgers, etc. Having been here numerous times within a short period, I can safely say that this establishment serves really great tasting food! Let me take you back to the beginning:I accidentally stumbled upon Balck Iron Burger one night after work as I was searching for somewhere to get dinner before heading home. I decided that I woyld go to Shorty's since I wanted a burger and fries. Hardly believing my own eyes, to my surprise  I saw that Shorty's has been permanently closed down. A huge ""space for rent"" sign is on the front  of the place. What?! Thinking about how Shorty's will be missed, I also walked by Woodland (also recently closed down) and was just going to walk to ""Not Rays"" to get pizza. All of a sudden not to far from the former ""Woodland"" and Sugarcane Restaurant was Black Iron Burger. I was so hungry that I happily walked in and got seated right away. Black Iron Burger is across the street from Doughnut Plant and down the block from the  3 train at the Bergen Street Station. Quaint and cozy are good words to describe Black Iron Burger as there is a nicely sized and well lit bar area w/ wooden stools as well as a mixture of mini high tables/regular sized tables + chairs for dining. There are also to-go/take out options in which you can order on-line and then pick up your food by the bar that also has a tv. Super cool decor includes their neon lit signs letting customers know that ""Nobody Beats Brooklyn"" (so true) and that ""Nobody Beats Our Meat"" (very true-lol).  Manager Pablo took my order and I had a York Burger and French Fries. I was hooked! Amazing flavor and seasonings in the burger and they make nice crispy french fries. They allow you to order specific special sauces to your order for an additonal fee bu things like lettuce, pickles etc. are complimentary. During my.first visit, I also had a Red Wine Sangria ($7) since Black Iron Burger has Happy Hour All Day Everyday! The sangria was nice + strong.Fast Forward to the present and I have returned to by myself, with one of my friends, etc. Black Iron Burger has a selection of various burgers including veggie burgers as well as other things like chicken, etc. I have had their beef burgers and popcorn chicken several times and both taste delicious!. The Happy Hour Menu also has Margaritas ($6.50), a Long Island Iced Tea ($8), Sangrias($7), Wines, Beer, etc. Fantastic Green Apple and Pineapple Margaritas! I enjoy watching sporting events, shows and anything else on theit television while eating my food. Oh and when you order soda you get free refills....Lastly, thanks to Pablo, Olivia and the rest of the sweet, professional, kind- hearted staff for always being so wonderful everytime I come to Black Iron Burger. Yes, I will be back very soon...probably some time this week-lol."

Walls are painted black. There's cheeky neon inside (""Nobody beats our meat"" and ""Nobody beats Brooklyn""). There are baskets hanging from the ceiling by the door for some reason.They have happy hour every day, including weekends (til 7)! We were there on a Saturday and they had certain beers for $6 (not all drafts, unfortunately). The beers were surprisingly expensive, actually ($8-9 and not particularly specialty crafts).However, the burgers were relatively inexpensive (from $12-16 depending on what you get). But you pay extra for fries and any extras other than LTO and pickles.I went with the Iberico Burger because it was the most expensive and it sounded the most unique - Manchego cheese (YUM), Iberico ham (double YUM), and a fried egg on top (triple YUM). And it was every bit as delicious/messy as it sounds. Their burgers are only 5oz, which is a perfect amount if you want starters or fries.I also tried the standard Black Iron burger, which is a double cheeseburger, and it was really good. They don't allow substitutions on their signature burgers, however. But I'm pretty sure they're all well made and balanced.Speaking of fries, the portions are gigantic. We did the herb garlic fries, and they were soaking in olive oil, but otherwise very good.We also started with the arugula Mexican salad, which was nice and fresh (came with pico de gallo and avocado).If I had to ding them for anything, service was a bit slow. The place wasn't that full, but there was a table in the back that kept trying to flag the waiter down (while we were also waiting to order). I think they were probably just inundated with Caviar and delivery orders.The other thing was the bathroom had a strong smell of paint thinner, so any time someone went in or out, you would get a whiff of it.The bathroom was pretty cool though. The sink is a big barrel.Would definitely recommend coming by, especially during happy hour! And if you check in on Yelp, you get $5 off $35!"
1241,vpkUUhs6dCnGeD-Vz0D29Q,1/31/2023,4 star rating,"This is a place with great ambiance and service! And if course the most important, great food.We ordered:Egg Souffle - This dish was so good. It was so flavorful and you can tell they made the egg with some sort of broth instead of water, which some places do, so it wasn't too eggy. It was also really fluffy and soft. Other places where I've had this dish usually make it so airy that it deflates easily and gives the egg a very spongy texture but that wasn't the case here at all.Kimchi Fried Rice w/ Chicken Katsu - This was the dish I saw online that made me want to come here so of course we ordered it! They pour the egg out in front of you which makes it perfect for taking pictures, but tip: once that egg starts cooking, you need to start mixing. We waited too long taking pictures and it ended up being a very smooth plasticy egg sheet because it's a very shallow area it's cooking in. Other than that, the dish itself wasn't especially special outside of just being good. The katsu was yummy and crispy but the rice itself was pretty average. Seafood Rice Bowl - Outside of the way it was served (it kind of looked like it was served in a dog bowl), this was probably my favorite dish. Usually rice bowls are good until you eat all the toppings and then you just have a plain rice left to finish. But the rice in this dish was fully seasoned itself and enjoyable on its own. There was also a lot of seafood inside so its not like you need to eat the rice by itself anyways. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the scallop was literally so tender, I couldn't get enough.Te banchan was really yummy too. They were all really refreshing and light, which made it seem more refined."

It do be a lil far from its fellow friend restaurants in Ktown but it's surelyyyy worth a detour, I can guarantee that. It's gotten me to go twice in less than two weeks and I usually like just trying things once.The sunset on jeju island drink is similar to the classic tequila sunrise but now you're sunsetting on a korean island. I'm a big beef noodle soup guy so I tried both the spicy and non spicy beef noodle soup and rather than one being better than the other, I think they serve different purposes. Like if you want a chill light broth thinner noods vibe, then go for the non spicy BNS. But if you're in it for the night and want intense flavor and a decent amount of spice with some thicccer (hand-pulled? ) noods, then go for the spicy. When you go, you'll probably see everyone next to you ordering the chicken katsu fried rice and be pondering, ""Is this a sign to order the chicken katsu?"" Well, lemme tell you that yes this is a sign. It's no wonder why everyoneeeeee is ordering this. This shit SLAPS. Very delicious crunchy katsu with the freshly fried egg hits the spot every time single time without fail.And lastly, special shout-out to my boy Jerry who works as the bartender and sometimes the host. He'll greet ya with the warmest of welcomes, supply good vibes like he's your bestie, and serve you with the utmost attention (if you get to be in his presence at the bar that is)."

Definitely order family style to try everything! You ever take a bite out of something so good that you don't know what to do except start laughing? Thats what me and my girlfriends did. Starting with the mandu, it was the juiciest umami bomb that I've encountered. The kimchi pork soup is solid - a signature Korean staple. The chicken katsu was perfectly cooked- crispy, and not dry at all. I loved mixing the egg on the stone plate and the kimchi fried rice was a solid staple as well.The tomahawk galbi was incredible. I loved the presentation and how it was perfectly cooked. It did not need ANY sauce or toppings really, but the ones provided also added and complimented the short rib well. The drinks were also all very well made and balanced. 'Departure' was super cool, because they pour it for you straight from the nitrogen tank.

Service was colloquial and very friendly and attentive. The side dishes, which were wonderful, were filled generously and consistently. The kimchi here was exactly my taste -- heavy handed on the fish sauce and perfectly balanced between crisp and fermented. The spicy beef noodle soup absolutely slaps. It was the coldest day of winter in recent memory and it warmed our souls and our gullets. The meat dishes were also all flawlessly done. The beef was so tender and flavorful in both the braised dish and the tomahawk. Prices are reasonable!Highly recommend this place overall.

We made a reservation for 7pm on a Thursday and the restaurant was relatively packed at the time. We were seated at a booth which I really liked bc the unique shape of the furniture felt extra private and also allowed us to easily sit next to each other. In general, I'd highly recommend this place for date night!We ordered the popular kimchi fried rice with chicken katsu and also tried the shrimp/scallop/caviar rice bowl. Our fav was def the kimchi fried rice with chicken katsu but the rice bowl was also delicious. Kimchi fried rice here was way better than most other places I've been to. I feel like oftentimes the gochujang overpowers that unique fried rice aroma (idk how to explain this aroma but iykyk) but this one was a PERFECT balance. Chicken katsu was also perfectly crispy yet juicy and the egg they pour onto the stone plate went very well with bites of fried rice. I feel like this dish was also really great value given the portions for the price. There aren't many places where I actively crave a dish I had at the restaurant later on but this is one of them.I loved how flavorful the rice in the shrimp/scallop/caviar rice bowl was and the seafood was also fresh. Very glad we tried it but def not as filling as the kimchi fried rice/katsu dish. Next time I'd love to try the tomahawk galbi as it's one of their most popular.Service was also great!

It has the kind of menu where you want to go back and try everything. Cocktails were delicious, although light, and variations on classics with Asian liquor. The owner, Kevin, was really friendly -- this is his second spot following the Jin in Hell's Kitchen, and named after his mom, which is sweet!

I believe they do take walk ins but it got pretty busy that night so I would recommend making a reservation in advance! We decided to come here around 5:30 pm on a Sunday and we were one of the first groups here so we were seated immediately but they got fairly busy and packed around 7 pm. The place has a cute cozy vibe - some seating in the front of the resturant and then more in the back. All the food looked so good on their social media. We decided to go with: -Sunset at Jeju Island: This drink was pretty refreshing and definitely reminded me of a tropical cocktail. Pretty yummy-Pyongmule: A new take of the usual moscow mule. It was pretty good but I think I liked the sunset at jeju island better-Beef Noodle Soup: I actually had pretty low expectation for this dish but my god I think it was one of my favorites. The soup base flavor was INSANE - it was so delicious and comforting. It was so flavorful without being too salty - highlyb recommend this dish-Kimchi Fried Rice with Chicken Katsu: One of the items that I've seen all over social media - this was delicious. The Chicken katsu was nicely fried and it went so well with the rice. Highly recommend this -Baby Back Rib: Also another popular item on their menu but honestly was not too impressed with it. Then again I'm not a huge ribs fan so that could be why but I did not find it really special. I would pass on this dishOverall - great vibes with good food at this place. Highly recommend coming here!

The staff here was very friendly and great about accommodating all of the changes and substitutions we asked for while we were ordering our food. We were a group of 5 and surprisingly everyone was happy with their food. I got a chicken wrap with curly fries, their portions are very generous and I was unable to finish all of the curly fries. We were there for hours catching up and the staff never rushed us which was nice. I noticed that there are a lot of older people dining alone here so it's really good that the staff doesn't rush you and were very friendly. This is a great spot for comfort food at any time."

Last 2 times awful experience, missing items and today, dry flavorless meat, and bread, they call Buffalo burger. That's all it comes with, not even a onion, a sauce. Dry chicken on the gyro platter and old salad,  if you dont want to waste time and money, stay away. Sad to see it go that way."

The Orion Nebula, greatest galactic combination of magical greatness all wrapped up in the cosmic stratosphere.  How do I know all of this astrological mumbo jumbo you may ask ? "" I don't!""

Strongly recommend! Curly fries are better than the regular fries. Tuna melt very big and pretty damn good. Tip: Ask for the fancy maple syrup."
1256,DYzpeSntTyL7ARvX3vSp6A,1/22/2023,1 star rating,I've been a customer of this place for years and have been noticing a steady decline in their quality and service since the pandemic. I've continued to support them throughout the pandemic as they've always been a steady and good quality eatery in my neighborhood but today that ends. The level of disrespect I was treated with today and coupled with the horrible meal I ate have convinced me to move on. Please save yourself some headache and disappointment and go somewhere else unless you want to wait over 30 mins for your wrong order with a side of attitude.
1257,DYzpeSntTyL7ARvX3vSp6A,12/17/2022,5 star rating,This place was sooooo yummy and the staff was so friendly. My friend only eats ranch and they were super accommodating bringing four bowls. The sandwiches are so good. The wine was also very good.

1259,DYzpeSntTyL7ARvX3vSp6A,12/11/2019,4 star rating,"This location is not too far from my house, but I have only been here once prior. This review serves to make up for the not so good experience I had a few years past. I came here with my family to fuel up for the NYC marathon. I ordered a waffle with two eggs two strips of bacon and sausage. The food came pretty quickly and the service was friendly. My daughter got some soup and realized with wasnt enough food so she also ordered a big bowl of grits. The grits came pretty quick considering it was a late add-on. I will say the grits were pretty bland and tasteless but atleast she had a full belly. I will say at this point Orion diner has earned another visit from me to partake in their lunch menu in the future."
1260,DYzpeSntTyL7ARvX3vSp6A,2/1/2022,1 star rating,Their delivery people are awful. Won't even try to find a place to put their bikes before calling and telling you that you need to come downstairs. My food was cold by the time the delivery person actually did his job.
1261,3NHexRXpc3Asuo0elQcDSw,1/3/2023,4 star rating,"Came here for dinner on NYE with my friends. We waited about 30mins or so for a table. We ordered the steamed egg with shredded pork, sautéed black fungus w/ yam, brown sugar glutinous rice cake, griddled shrimp & spare rib, spicy frog, Sichuan style spicy chicken, pig blood in sour spicy oil, and hibachi tofu. Wow everything was sooo delicious! My ultimate favorite has to be the steamed egg with shredded pork and the glutinous rice cake that is more for dessert. If you're not familiar with Szechuan food, everything is normally very spicy, oily, and salty. It's normally meant to be eaten with rice to balance the flavors. If you can't handle spice very well, this may not be for you. The prices of each dish is a little more on the pricier side but they offer a store membership you can join and you'll get a few dollars off per dish (we actually just used my friends since she comes here regularly haha). This is now my new favorite Szechuan restaurant in the area! The location of this restaurant is a huge plus for me since there is lots of parking. Will definitely be coming back and try other things on their menu."
1262,3NHexRXpc3Asuo0elQcDSw,3/21/2023,4 star rating,"Ordered take out from here, packaging is good nothing spilled, front desk is also efficient in answering. Food is overall average if counting it a authentic Sichuan restaurant. The chicken in chilly over is soft and tender but the seasoning can be more flavorful. I understand these dishes def need a lot of oil but the amount of used in both potato and fish is too much that every scoop from the soup is oil first. Overall a good restaurant to eat with friends and family."
1263,3NHexRXpc3Asuo0elQcDSw,4/10/2023,5 star rating,Great food at Double Happiness. Have been back many times with friend and family. Ask for mild if you can't eat too spicy.

We can't handle too much spice so we order the non or mildly spicy dishes. So far, I have yet to encounter a dish I don't like. Nice ambiance with light, mellow background music and modern decor."
1268,3NHexRXpc3Asuo0elQcDSw,11/15/2022,4 star rating,"A tad more upscale Chinese restaurant in the Bayside area specializing in northern Chinese cuisine. If you can hang with spicy, I'd say this place is worth trying. The fish is particularly good so I would definitely recommend when doing family style.Pro tip: parking is easy to find in the area so don't sweat it!"

It's a cool, no frills, dive bar conveniently located a block away from the Bedford Avenue L stop. Whenever I arrive to Williamsburg earlier than I need to be I end up coming here to grab a drink to kill time. I've also been here with friends to grab drinks and enjoy their small arcade section in the back. Each time we're able to find space to relax and don't feel like the music is too loud, or that the crowd is too boisterous. They also give coupons for a free personal pizza with your drink during happy hour throughout the week. They also have this promotion at various times throughout the weekend as well. The staff here was also very attentive from the moment I walked in. They got my drinks to me fast and were also quick in getting me the check when I was done.Definitely come here if you're looking for a great dive bar in the area, close to the subway, and one that also feeds you too!"
1272,6gPa-25RIcjTudX2s9Mrsg,1/23/2020,5 star rating,"It was my first time coming here and I'm so glad I found this place! The interior seems like a normal bar the moment you step in, however they also have a few games in the back if that's more your vibe. The best thing about this bar however is the fact that they give you a free (cheese) pizza with each purchase of any drink!! You're able to add any of their available toppings for $1! You could basically get full from buying 2-3 drinks. The pizza was pretty decent sized as well, enough to fill you up if you're not too hungry. Great place to catch up with friends if you're in the Williamsburg area!"
1273,6gPa-25RIcjTudX2s9Mrsg,4/9/2022,3 star rating,"Hi. My friend and I went tonight to this place. Got in right away. Security? Super nice! But these shots? Really fucking bad. Don't get a shot here. Maybe their drinks are good, but I wouldn't know, and the shot are actually horrible. Just know that."
1274,6gPa-25RIcjTudX2s9Mrsg,8/3/2019,5 star rating,"Quick recap: you get pizza with your drink. Is there anything else you need to read in this review? This is literally paradise for anyone addicted to alcohol and pizza simultaneously. That being said, this is a hole in the wall type of joint and is getting reviewed as one. Don't come here expecting egg whites on your farm grown apricot mixed drink. This is a well drink and beer type of joint that delivers. Toppings on the pizza will cost you 1 buck per topping but it's still a bargain. Well worth a place to check out and enjoy some good drinks and good pizza."
1275,6gPa-25RIcjTudX2s9Mrsg,7/10/2016,4 star rating,"Oh, how I love this place. If you're looking for a no frills bar, this is your place. From 12-8pm everyday, they operate on happy hour prices, where drinks are around the $4-$6 range and most (if not all) of your drinks come with a personal pizza. EVERY SINGLE DRINK GETS ITS OWN PIZZA. If you're a pizza lover, open up your heart to your new favorite spot - Charleston. The place is definitely extra divey, with dim lights, random seats, the odd game or two in the back. The service is always on point though, but make sure to ask for your pizza ticket, because they don't always just give them to you. They also check your IDs at the door and don't allow any outside liquids in. I've had to throw away a few water bottles and force down some kombucha too quickly before here. I really can't say anything bad about this spot. If all you're looking for is a drink and some socializing, Charleston has you covered."
1276,6gPa-25RIcjTudX2s9Mrsg,4/16/2018,4 star rating,"The Charleston is a dope hang out dive bar in the Williamsburg section of BK. A friend of mine introduced me to this spot a few months back and not that I was surprised being that Williamsburg has been on the come up of hang out areas outside of Manhattan but was pleased with my recent outings here. Diverse patrons, cool bar tenders, inexpensive drinks and the top part...you get a pizza, yes a pizza pie (although small) with every drink you order. Just make sure you ask for a pizza ticket with your order. Very well worth it as the pizza is fresh out of the oven and very good, especially if you're already had a good amount of drinks to prep you up for consumption. Now honestly, I am not one to really hang out in Brooklyn like that but for the times anyone I hang with say they wanna hang out and drinks in BK I will gladly suggest this place. Good, lively location and a lot of after hour eateries and public transportation to get around."
1277,6gPa-25RIcjTudX2s9Mrsg,3/12/2020,4 star rating,This is one of my favorite after work places. Divey bar with happy hour/ free pizza ($1 for extra toppings) to snack on while you chat and lay back. I always enjoy a Chardonnay and/or a margarita while I decompress after a long day. Bartenders and main guy at the pizza section are always friendly. Edit: I had to drop a star. This place has random plumbing issues where the whole bar will smell like toilet. They need to fix that ASAP
1278,6gPa-25RIcjTudX2s9Mrsg,8/22/2019,4 star rating,"They've updated it. The bar is much more modern but still the same dive feel. The pizza is really good and extra toppings are just a buck, try sausage and pepperoni. The female bartender is so sweet and attentive. The male one, not so much, on his phone constantly and charged me extra for my beer. I should have spoken up but ehhh, I just pick my battles sometimes. Head there for cheap eats and drinks. Lots of seating, lots of games, and a jukebox  you control. PS.- Tip your pizza guy!"
1279,6gPa-25RIcjTudX2s9Mrsg,3/14/2017,3 star rating,"Looks like a dive bar, smells like a dive bar.The main attraction here is the free pizza you get with a $4 purchase ... aka a drink purchase. Honestly, it's pizza so why not. The drink prices/deals were pretty reasonable.We came here to kill time because the wait for a table at Sweet Chick down the block was over an hour. Had a couple beers, some pizza, AND there's also arcade games (including skee ball!) The games all take card as well, not just coins/singles."

I'll stick with the falafel next time. I've had it as both a deluxe sandwich and a platter, and have always enjoyed them. You will, too!"
1283,njKwUg6oYDEEtLuunTmgbg,8/16/2022,3 star rating,"I really wanted to like this place as I'm just next door  but the food was just so mediocre. The price, great. The chicken shawarma was dry and bland and mixed with way too much iceberg lettuce and tomatoes (that's it). The hummus was very basic, the tahini had no flavor, and the hot sauce was Texas Pete...? I'm a neighbor and the price was really favorable so I feel as if 3 stars is justifiable"
1284,njKwUg6oYDEEtLuunTmgbg,3/23/2022,1 star rating,"Was excited to try this place after reading all the good reviews , however, I literally saw the guy (looked like the owner) preparing my food pick up his phone to text and then put it down and pick up the pita bread to make my sandwich with his bare hands, without washing his hands first nor at least wearing gloves/using a tissue. Other than that, I ended up just eating the falafel and the filling inside the pita bread, which was good but not sure if I'd come back after seeing such unsanitary practices specially during COVID time."

The owner was really friendly and they also have a table outside so you can eat there. I think it's cash only on purchases less than $10.
1287,njKwUg6oYDEEtLuunTmgbg,7/7/2019,2 star rating,"Heights Falafel is a quick cheap bite in Brooklyn that will save you from dying of hunger at cheap prices  but was not a lot more going on.I ordered the falafel sandwich at the counter and found that the service  was  on the curt side, which was understandable as they were really busy.The food was mediocre, the falafel was not great and the sauces and toppings were just meh.The venue is on the smaller side with a few tables which did not seem to be cleaned very often in between customers. The trashcan was overflowing with plates and was in urgent need for a cleaning as well. I get it that the place gets busy people should pay more attention to overflowing bins of trash and the smell that is produced as a consequence."
1288,njKwUg6oYDEEtLuunTmgbg,8/1/2021,5 star rating,Absolutely wonderful prices and portions. Great food all around. The falafel plate is $8 and comes with a ton of food! Great spot.
1289,njKwUg6oYDEEtLuunTmgbg,5/2/2018,5 star rating,"Heights Falafel could be the cheapest food in the gentrified area of northern Brooklyn. It's a big portion of food for the money. When your hipster friends are blowing their savings at the newest fusion place you can come here and eat until full. It's not even like it's in the ghetto. This is just a few blocks from the bridge, so not a bad way to go. I had the falafel combo. It comes with hummus, pita bread, and tabbouli. This was a filling meal, unlike whichever hipster restaurant gives you a paltry amount of food for astronomical prices, so good work by Yelp. It wasn't the crappy falafel that looks like burnt feces either. These were humongous. A thick creamy hummus was a good accompaniment. The tabbouli was good too, unlike some which have no flavor. All this was about $7, which sounds like it's not possible in Brooklyn. Oh but yes it was. Maybe the only bad thing is there's not too much room inside. Though I was the only customer so it wasn't a problem. It has to be one of the most affordable independent restaurants in Brooklyn. It's a relief there's some with reasonable prices. The portions are big and won't empty a wallet."
1290,njKwUg6oYDEEtLuunTmgbg,5/7/2018,5 star rating,"WHOA! This little hallway of a restaurant knows how to fill a plate with delicious food. I ordered a falafel plate and it came with the moon and the stars! Okay, maybe just pita, hummus, tabbouleh, rice...honestly I lost track. Oh, but there were a couple included stuffed grape leaves and they were good! The falafel was crispy and freshly fried. I really loved everything on the plate. Friendly staff, clean place and we left more than full. Note: There is no customer bathroom from what I could tell, but there is a good amount of seating."

Not too overly sweet, soggy or coated in anything too powerful. The cake was most, spongy and perfectly done! Complimented by the refreshing ginger tea I had here this place rules for a quick bite! They've got WiFi and usually have a lot of open tables. Only complaint is the vibe is a bit missing, but it doesn't even matter really, just come here for the food and drinks!"

The decor is no frills, so you're not coming here for ambiance, but the food more than makes up for it. They are fairly inexpensive considering the portion sizes are HUGE, humongous. We plated our meal and still had two days worth of leftovers. The food was *just* as delicious over the course of the next two days. The platanos maduros, plantains, rice and beans and arroz con gandules were all cooked and seasoned to perfection. The pernil was juicy and tender and flavorful and my garlic shrimp were cooked in a delicious butter lemon garlic sauce that was rich and creamy. Everything was so delicious and perfect. The waitress was super friendly and pretty quick to bring out our food. I would highly recommend El Caribeno if you're looking for Latin Cuisine (specifically from the Dominican Republic) and in the area. I would definitely return."

The rice was soft and the beans were hot and flavorful. The pork could have used some more salt/flavor, so we had to compensate with hot sauce. But overall, very hearty and a very good portion for lunch.The sausage mofongo was huge really delicious. The sausage tasted like it was fried, so it added a crunchy, crispy texture to the otherwise soft and chewy plantain base. The sauce that you are supposed to pour on top really brought everything together. Would not have been nearly as good without the sauce. It's a must. The service was also very good. Waitress was friendly and helpful in answering our questions. We didn't have to wait long to be seated or for our food."

The most amazingly friendly and attentive staff served us delicious food on a fantastical relaxing and scenic deck ever. We felt like we had been transported to an island paradise. We had delicious oysters to start and I had an amazing Shrimp Fra Diavlo for my meal - just the right combination of spice and flavor with hefty shrimp. Tara had the Lobster Ravioli and said it was heavenly (she repeated this assertion about 10 times)."

We started off with some bread...a wonderful soft loaf with a thin and crunchy crust. The olive oil was infused with rosemary which was beautifully aromatic. Next was our hot antipasto appetizer accompanied by the Portofino Salad. YUMMMM! The dressing was light and clean and refreshing while the hot antipasto appetizer was savory and deep.Our lobster tail and  sirloin steak were as close to perfect as you can get....falling out of the shell and cutting like butter, respectively. Then the dessert was a fantastically fluffy tirimisu accompanied by their homemade dessert drinks: grappa and lemon cello.  Everything was tipped off with this wonderful Merlot... Casa de Toro I believe. Our evening at Portofino was amazing. The music was not too loud and our waiters: Val, Antonio, and Enis were on their game. Such a sweet and accommodating team. Honestly, I'd be alright having my wedding here. It was awesome!"

The outdoor area was dirty and piles of dishes and half eaten food sat for over 2 hours in our view. No bread and butter, food took forever and even though we made our reservations for outside, they tried to dissuade us from sitting outside. We made reservations for OUTSIDE. Very confusing. The food was good but I will probably be hesitant to return after what we experienced. It's Mother's Day...expect a rush and plan accordingly."

I wish things were different because I'd love to dine in. I did see they had an open area in the back, not sure if it was open because I didn't ask. Just call ahead for the hours but would highly recommend if you want a perfectly made marg while at City Island!"

I was sitting on the outdoor deck at my table and was attacked by a raccoon and had to immediately go to the hospital for rabies shots. My aunt came to the restaurant a week later and asked the staff what they had done about the raccoon problem. They told her they had captured the raccoon put up fences to keep them out. While she was eating her dinner a raccoon scratched her leg! Clearly not enough is being done about this raccoon problem. Unless you want a rabid raccoon interrupting your meal I would avoid this restaurant.

Once seated (we requested the outdoor patio) we inquired about the special and were told it was a Mon-Fri deal disappointed but we decided to stay. The menu is limited and pricey so many others entering asked about the special after being seated and got up and left. We opted for the calamari, seafood salad, seafood linguini chefs special, penne a la vodka and lobster ravioli. I must say the appetizers had the freshest seafood I have ever tasted. The calamari nice and soft, the mussels in the salad the cleanest, not one grain of sand and the smoothest slivers of oysters. My sister ordered the penne, it's her usual when she finds it on any menu and she was impressed. My ravioli was a generous serving and deliciously creamy, my mom said her special was so delicious her only regret was not wanting to get dirty tearing into her lobster. Sorry I have no photos on this meal as we were enjoying it all to well. I gave 4 stars over 5 because I didn't expect to spend $166 on lunch for 3 when many other places on the island have a Sunday brunch menu. Especially since we only had water with our meals."

However, the food was mediocre.  We ordered * cucumber chili  ar $7 expensive for not very tasty pickles * chicken gyoza at 10 this was good*torigara Ramen at 18 This ramen was mediocre and 3 stars.  Not bad but the nama-ramen at home is slightly tastier. It is a shame as our expiration was high.  We paid $80+ including tip, for 2 people.  It was not worth it.  They charge the bottle of tea (yes, they give you a bottle) at $4. ( the bottles are sold in dispensers in japan at 130 yen which is less than $1 now due to weak yen)."

Prices are quite high, reflective of current inflation. Most of the items tasted below average and aren't worth the cost, other than the tonkotsu ramen. Prices are a bit higher than in the picture shown.@ yuzu wings - half wings fried topped with yuzu sauce, tasty especially with the spicy sauce provided, pitiful portion@ yuzu tsukemen - noodles are a bit overdone for me, dipping sauce is very flavorful, quite sour and acidic. Not too much of a fan even though I love dip ramen@ steak mazemen - very expensive, steak is okay, noodles are overdone and subpar, not much flavor@ tonkotsu ramen - delicious porky creamy soup, goes perfectly with the noodles, the only thing worth getting, and pricey enough that it's for an occasion"

1325,c6R_hvUwsqXX2MUXWtO94Q,5/25/2022,3 star rating,"TLDR: Decent ramen shop right by the Willliamsburg Bridge but expensive. It's good if you're in the area but wouldn't make this a destination.Nakamura was on my list for a very very long time. Eventually the stars aligned and we were able to stop by for a late lunch.For starters ordered the gyoza and yuzu wonton soup. Gyoza was thin-skinned, crispy but a bit small. Yuzu wonton was enjoyable enough but again, $10 for a pretty small bowl with basically a dollop of chili oil on top.The ramen. I got the Torigara which is their signature ramen. At $18 with no egg or additional topping, this is an expensive bowl. The broth was clean, relatively light but it just seemed to miss that punch for me. The ingredients were fine but nothing stood out. Wife's Ton Toro was better but again, at $19 with no toppings - I think your money can go longer elsewhere.Would I try it again? Maybe, if I was in the area. However, Ishida is also down the block and till this day; I still think about that bowl."

Quality noodles and broth but nothing spectacularly remarkable. The menu is quite small and they only have one pork ramen - the rest are chicken or vegan. The prices also seem very high considering that the ramen doesn't have many ingredients in it - the XO miso literally only has cabbage and fake ground pork and noodles, for $20. They also charge you $2 for the egg - which i understand is a general practice but it wasn't stated anywhere in the menu nor told to us by the server."

Seems like we scan the QR code and place the order ourselves and they bring out the food to us. Ordered the tontoro ramen and although it tasted ok, really disappointed it only came with 1 piece was chashu. The ramen wasn't that chewy either and the soup was lukewarm."
1329,c6R_hvUwsqXX2MUXWtO94Q,6/1/2022,5 star rating,"I went with the tontoro. The broth here has a beautiful silky, rich texture and an intense pork flavor, with a slight bitter soy sauce finish which makes you crave the next slurp. They really nail the noodles here also- they are curly with just the right amount of chew. I think they are shorter than most ramen noodles I've had? This means I made less of a mess while eating. The bamboo shoots are sliced thin and combine with the noodles. The flavor is different than the standard menma I think and they offer a pop of sweetness and fibrous textural contrast in each bite of noodles. The pork is not a typical chashu. In my opinion, it was a bit dry and the fat was gelatinous instead of tender. I found it to be very salty but not unbearably so. The egg was over marinated for my taste- too intensely salty. I wish there was a little more spinach! The place is quite small and you order and pay on your phone so it's a nice place to go if you don't want to talk to anyone. It's certainly on the pricey side and not the largest portion size ($19+2 for egg) I think the bowls they have are very cute."

This location is way off the beaten path and very small.We came in late afternoon and it wasn't busy so was served rather quickly. We both had the Ton Toro Pork and added an egg. The noodles are thick and the broth is as hearty. Although my taste buds wanted some salt, I added some spicy (chili)  to the ramen and  that worked out well...was excellent.Note: no outdoor seating despite the description on Yelp saying they do have, and the portions are not small.

I went with my kids after a movie trip and they wanted something different. I found BKNY on my favorite go to website - say it with me, ""YELP""! The curry my daughter ordered was good, she loved the sticky rice and spices. My son enjoyed the food - chicken wings with pineapple rice. He asked if we could come after the movies and we've been there once again for the same orders. Yet again no complaints and their belly's were full. I think we'll make this our go to after the movies at AMC fresh meadows location - 10 mins away. We always leave with plenty of leftovers so for me it's PERFECT! One issue I had was I ordered two orders of wings and they brought two orders on one plate. The wings looked like they got mugged- extra small. I told the waiter that's not what I ordered and he said he would speak to the cook. He came back and apologized but wasn't able to give extra wings. I'm only bringing it up so it doesn't happen to another Yelper or other guest reading this post. . ENJOY!"

When I visited, I ordered the roti chicken massaman curry for the table as an appetizer, as well as the chicken pad see ew and Thai iced tea. The curry appetizer was the perfect size for two people. It came stocked with all the same ingredients as the entree massaman curry, and was essentially just a mini form of the entree. The roti it came with tasted light, fresh, and delicious. The Thai iced tea was pretty standard, but also very tasty. For the entree, they let you choose the spice level you like. I ordered my pad see ew at medium spice level and it was the perfect level of spicy to enjoy all the flavors but still feel a little heat. The service is friendly, and I've had good luck with parking in the area. If you're looking for casual Thai food where you can enjoy the dine in experience, definitely give this place a try!"

This review is to comment on their indoor dining. We experienced not only Great food, but efficient service. Came here yesterday with family for late lunch (2pm) and we were seated quickly. A number of us ordered the beef tendon & brisket pho, a classic! I wish there was more protein in my bowl, specifically tendon & tripe, but or bowls came out piping hot. They also offered us a generous amount of pho accoutrement (bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime, jalapeños).Others in our party had the pork chops, which were marinated in a tasty sauce and grilled. Both went paired well with either rice or noodle soup.

There is no competing pho stores nearby like Flushing does so I came here.I ate in the restaurant the cold water they give tasted like sink toilet smell. Probably straight from kitchen faucet. The meat had a smell/aftertaste to it that was not good. Tasted cheap and soup base just tasted like salty ramen water. Usually the broth is the main reason I get pho with the hearty meat and veggies noodles. This was dissatisfaction.I ordered drinks because the water tasted terrible and soup too but the drinks were horrendous too. Service is okay but just the taste of food is a no for me....

Between our group, we were able to try many different dishes from the pho, rice dishes, spring rolls, grilled squid, iced coffee - really you name it, we tried it. The food here is really flavorful and well prepared/presented. I normally like to stick with rice dishes, and was able to try a bit of the grilled beef, chicken and pork. All of them were flavored wonderfully and you could taste a little bit of the smokey flavor which was fantastic. On the other hand the broth of the pho was delicious. You can tell they cooked the broth for several hours, since it had layers of flavor. The appetizers - spot on! They have a lot of the traditional appetizers but also some new ones I enjoyed! Most importantly I felt that the dishes and ingredients were really clean, not too oily or heavy.The restaurant ambiance feels open and clean. Lots of seating available.

I also recommended getting a side bowl of rice and dumping ALL of it in when you're done with all the delicious meat, vegetables, and everything else included in the big bowl.

1358,1K_vl1JvwRrLORBox0U1uQ,6/3/2019,4 star rating,"It is Chipotle, ""fast casual"" which is basically fast food. If you never had a Chipotle before, its basically some meat cooked on a hot surface that was previously marinated. Depending on the worker, you may or may not have something that is overcooked sometimes, just like any other fast food place that is understaffed and flooded with customers. You can then add rice, salsa, lettuce, etc to make it into a burrito or just put it all in a bowl to avoid the mess.Looking at the negative (click lowest rated) yelp reviews of Chipotle, people are complaining about things that can easily be remedied.Yes, sometimes they don't give you a lot of hot sauce. So just ask for more. Yes, sometimes the staff tries to service you faster. That is because they're ingrained to deal with high volume of people, just like any other fast food joint. You can talk slower or think about what you actually want first before you get on line. Okay they ran out of chips when they're close to closing, do you think the staff can make chips out of nowhere? Someone else complained about closing early. They do not close at 10pm they close at 9:30pm please read the sign. If the guac is brownish color, WHY WOULD YOU GET IT? You can see the guac right there. Guac turns color due to oxidation which is a normal chemical reaction and it will not give you food poisoning. Someone else complained that ""they asked for a little of something"" and then the staff ""gave them too much"". Ok, what measurement unit is ""a little""? At chipotle, you can ask for the add ons to be placed on the side (meaning in a separate container) so you can control how much they put.I've been to this chipotle since they've opened in 2013 and any rude interactions I've seen were from customers giving the staff disrespect. Compared to a lot of other places, this chipotle tries their best to make things right if you ask nicely. The only ""bad service"" I've gotten was being told I needed to wait cause they were cooking a new batch of meat and one other time I came when they were close to closing and they told me they were not going to make another batch of meat cause they were going to close soon (which is perfectly reasonable!)"

When I do I choose to get the bowl with white rice, black beans, the steak and some lettuce. It's always great, never had a problem. However, the staff seem to always be in a rush when servicing me even when there isn't a line. They're fast, I'll give them that but I don't like to be rushed especially when I am there because I'm on my break from work. Break time is relax time, there's no reason to rush me if I'm the only one there in fact the longer I stay there the more I am likely to purchase. The staff could use some relax time2/5/18 decided to get three sides today white rice, lettuce and beans. Was charged $11.70. I asked $11.70 even tho I didn't order a meal and there's no meat the guy Evance said yes. What Evan didn't know was that I ordered the same thing last week and was charged about$5 because they placed the order down as sides. I'm going to have lunch somewhere else from now on."

Seriously.When it's hard to take the rest of the chain laden food court seriously in Queens Center Mall, I thought I was doing myself a favor by going here. The lines were short, the food is supposed to be healthy, and I actually like Chipotle in most instances. Even the low Yelp rating wasn't enough to dissuade me, because I wanted to believe they were better than that. Not so.I ordered a regular asada burrito, three tacos of sofritas, and a carnitas burrito bowl for the group. The line was unbearingly slow, mainly because the guy behind the counter seemed hard of hearing. I would say ""carnitas"" or ""sofritas"" and he'd say ""haaaa!?"" When ""pork"" and ""vegan / tofu"" didn't work, I knew he was simply hard of hearing. The remaining workers along the line were also slow and it became difficult to choose the next few items.Next was a girl who was really trying to give me a hard sell on guacamole. It was already $10 for the burrito, what's another $2.50 really? I opted out in hopes of speeding things along but she was pushing for any guacamole on any of the items. She kept muttering that it was ""fresh"" and ""perfect"" for a burrito bowl / taco topping but after a decisive and hard ""No THANK you"" she wrapped the items and shot them over to the cashier without so much of a thanks or any eye contact.$33 after tax, I headed over to the table and realized that there really wasn't much filling in any of them. It was as if the proteins were dialed back a tad, indicating there was some sort of shortage of items at the counter. Nope, the food bins were full and only few people in line. Turns out they were just being stingy.When the food and customer service fails, there's no reason for me to come back."

Since this is the only chipotle I been to, I love the food here. I love the rice, steak, chicken, and everything else.The line is always packed here. When I was on the line waiting, the worker (female) gave a man 2 spoon of white rice. When it was finally my turn, I asked for white rice and received half a spoon. HALF A SPOON. I clearly saw the women give that man 2 SPOON. They always push down the food from the counter back into the bowls. It's very disturbing but as an unhealthy person, I still eat it. When I try to get a fork, their forks are so dirty and I found hair in them as well. The workers are rude but it doesn't bother me because I'm not there to make friends. I just want my food. Their burritos are always so weird. When they try to get a wrap out from the bag, it always rip/break. But they still use it and give it to the customers. I remember the first time I bought their chips. Never again will I buy them. They tasted expired and plastic. It was disgusting."

When I asked again for more cheese she picked out a tiny pinch and added it to my burrito. Last, I asked for guacamole on the side and she put it at the side of my burrito and wrapped it. In what world does on the side mean inside?The food did taste fine...but this is supposed to be a burrito made the way I like it...and it very clearly failed there."

Not while we're in Carroll Gardens. Not on my watch. Not while D'Amico exists. I brought her over, and watched as her eyes widened in wonder. I watched her marvel over the machine mixing and roasting beans right in the front of the shop. I watched her peruse all the options, finally picking a blend (organic, fair trade Sumatra). I listened as her and the helpful coffee guy discussed the type of coffee machine she had, and watched him grind the beans into a bag. I watched her pay, and smiled when she said that while not cheap, it was a better price per pound than Starbucks.

We ordered the lagmans soup, manty's with meat and the Pilav.The lagmans soup was delicious, it was not spicy as I've had other lagmans soup that was a bit spicy. plenty of noodles with pieces of beef and roasted red peppers. Very comforting bowl of soup. The manty's (3 pieces) were filled with ground beef and onions. I've had much better manty's at other places so this was ok. The meat was a bit strong with taste, maybe it was not seasoned enough. Plus $6 for 3 pieces i thought was expensive.The Pilav was delicious, the rice was soft and flavor in abundance. The pieces of lamb on top of the rice was falling off the bone delicious, tasty and goes well with the rice. The rice itself had carrots and chick peas mixed in with a mild taste of cumin. All together it worked really well.The servers were attentive and friendly. I would definitely come here again."

A good friend of mine comes to this restaurant regularly with his family, so it can't be bad! & trust me, it's not...it may look like a hole in the wall and people are not so friendly because you don't speak the language but once you get past that, get ready for some fresh, delicious food. Let's get to the breakdown:The place - like I said, hole in the wall, unassuming restaurant. Parking around the area is tough, so plan ahead. Casual, nothing fancy. Can accommodate big groups, so call ahead to rsvp. Food - everything I've had here was great! I'll lost my favorites: Chai - tea. Option of black or green. Ask for sugar cubes. Fresh salad - literally just that. Mix of tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and other daily fresh veggies they have. Let them know what size you want. Small or large. Samsa - a small ""empanada"". It's made fresh daily and it comes stuffed with lamb meat & onions. Comes with a tomato sauce salsa for it. Get it. Lagman noodle soup - their version of a hand pulled noodle soup with lamb meat and vegetables. You can order a small cup or large bowl. Fresh every time and I usually get the small just so I can get my fix with everything else. Garlic French fries - self explanatory. Great side to share and real potatoes ! Shish kabobs - I get the lamb, chicken (boneless), & the sea bass. Gotta get them all. They all come super tender and juicy. Trust me. Rice pilaf - not always available so ask if they have it. It's how I would describe it as a soft fried rice with tender pieces of carrots with lamb meat. It's a meal in itself, so share it or devour it on your own. The menu is extensive but the above is my go to. I've brought friends here and they all feel in love and thank me for taking them. Just remember they close for religious reasons, for example Friday's for sabbath. Call ahead or check Yelp to see if they are open. Let me know what you guys think!"

The prices are super cheap but when since each skewer is 2-3 bucks and you keep ordering your check might end up being really high so watch out for that. The restaurant isn't that spacious. It's two different rooms, one of which is typically reserved for large parties. The decor isn't anything special and the ambiance is pretty much for locales.

My friend ordered their half chicken, half pork Katsu set an hours delicious. Nothing additional just Katsu with rice and a Katsu Sauce was delicious. If I were to visit again, I'd get there most basic items. Tl;dr - most basic plain katsu set taste the best!"

I've ordered the Okonomiaki and Agedashi Tofu as appetizers which were both good. My most ordered entree is Pork Loin Katsu Curry, which is great value ($20) for a pretty large portion that will leave you full. I usually skip the sets, as I don't love either soup and salad that come with sets A/B. The curry is flavorful, but I wish the spice level was adjustable other than the spicy powder they provide on every table. The rice is cooked well."

The curry itself was good but we find the spice flavor to be on a strong side.The venue is cozy and the service was good.Over all I think this restaurant gets the basic right, and that's what people want in Tonkatsu. Plus this is very affordable at only $25. 5 stars - best tonkatsu in NYC"

Despite my initial hesitancy at the price, the Berkshire pork Katsu curry is absolutely worth it. The katsu is perfectly fried to be light and crispy on the outside but juicy and tender on the inside, and the curry is so rich and flavorful and unlike any other curry I've tried before. The pickled red side also adds the perfect bright pop of freshness to cut through the heaviness of the curry. Highly highly recommend, and can't wait to be back!"

The place isn't super big but has good ambiance and lighting. I also really enjoyed the sweet and sour sauce on the table. The miso soup and cabbage salad was also great. The daikon oroshi was grated small and was also awesome but the sauce with it was a bit sweet. The miso soup and cabbage slaw was awesome! Overall highly recommend, and is in a good location downtown that isn't too crowded."

The restaurant was almost full but luckily there was a table available so we did not have to wait long when we arrived. Once we were sat, we debated on which apps to order but decided to hold off since the sets looked like they would be big enough (and we were right). I ordered the Brooklyn set which came with soup, pork loin, 2 Japanese style fried chicken, salad and a side of white rice. For drinks we kept it simple and ordered the Oolong tea-- which was very refreshing. The set itself was delicious - crunchy katsu on the outside and juicy tender on the inside. I am so glad we did not order any appetizers because the portions were quite big and we actually ended up boxing up the leftovers. Other than that, the service was great and the kitchen staff greeted us as we walked in/out. Overall, I had a nice experience at Katsu-Hama and was quite pleased with their Brooklyn Set. For my next visit, I'll skip the sets so I can also enjoy some of their other smaller plates (tako-yaki, okonomi-yaki, etc)."

Got the surprise katsu curry and the surprise donburi and it was a truck load of food. The pork and chicken were both excellent (tho pork was a little more juicy) and perfectly crisp/tender. The prawns were ginormous. The karaage was super juicy as well. The curry was so flavorful, exploding with uname and onion flavor. Def a step up from box curry. The donburi was great too tho I think it could have used a little more sauce. But still amazing. Came with miso soup and cabbage. Recommend trying the spicy powder - added a nice touch. It was actually too much food so I took some home, will make a nice lunch tmr :D"

The katsu was great, well cooked chicken and pork in a healthy amount of curry sauce. The curry sauce could've maybe been a bit better, it was pretty typical so nothing bad by any means but nothing super special either. But the chicken and pork were great.Service was really quick too - benefit of having a straightforward menu i suppose. I'd probably return"

I ordered the #7 or #10. It was a fish sandwich w/ cheese and it was delicious. It came with a drink of my choice and fries but I hate the taste of the fries. I actually prefer eating fries from anywhere except Checkers. The establishment was very clean though. The (unisex) bathroom was locked so I had to ask for a key but it too was clean.

I've seen Mr. king himself multiple times on my trips and he is always wearing a mask. Further, I really love to support a business that supports the community.

Showed him the email and let him know I have that site my payment info...didn't care and replied with ""it's a third party site I didn't get no order so you wanna order or what?!"" I told him you don't have to speak to people that way and walked out. I've been in the service industry for over 20 years and this is unacceptable I don't care who you think you are.

1424,b1ImfytJYXEgSJSosssxMA,3/2/2020,2 star rating,"Only reason I gave this place two stars is because the smoothie was really good. First lets start with whomever was behind the counter, I think it was the  owner. He was on the phone didn't even greet me when I came in and there was no one else in there so it wasn't too hard to say hello. It was my first time there so I wasn't exactly sure how the ordering worked, I saw the ""sweetie"" and i asked if it was a smoothie, he quickly snapped at me saying it was a juice and then pointed to where the smoothies were on the menu. I started to give my order and he stopped me mid-way through saying you want a build your own, i guess because I didn't want the wheatgrass it made it a build your own. I finished my order and he asked me what size I wanted I say the 16oz which was on the menu, he then said we only had these sizes, pointing the three cup sizes on the counter, guess I was getting a 20oz then. I went to pull my wallet out to pay with my card and he says we only take cash, despite the fact that there is a sign on the door that says they take credit cards and contactless cards! WTH!! He then says there is an atm across the street. I walk across the street to bakery to use their ATM and then return back to purchase my smoothie. The owner is now on the phone with someone else talking about they are discriminating against him. And still barely no eye contact. He hands me my smoothie (without wearing any  gloves used to handle food...gross) and surprisingly says' Thanks and then goes back to his phone conversation.  Terrible customer service and false advertising (sorta). I enjoyed the smoothie but not enough to ever go back there!!! They may have an ""A"" in being cleaning and an A for the smoothies, but they get an F from me for customer service, which in my opinion is the most important thing when it comes to dealing with people."

Well, probably the same people that prefer to pay unwordly prices downtown at some rooftop for the same stuff and then buckle up and save to pay the rent and utilities. Don't get me wrong, I love some of the downtown places or Brooklyn spots (per my reviews), but they are insanely priced for what they have to offer, especially when the end result is the same, you get tipsy. With that said, I think Trinity it's awesome, because there's no BS. No food, no false advertising or anything like that. It's a good bar, plain and simple, with ""reasonable"" prices (as reasonable as NYC goes). I feel the UES is very underrated. From someone who went out in every neighborhood in NYC."

When it's crowded, they will help you find a place to stand or sit near the bar and they will most likely remember your name when you return.  Great place to grab a drink and unwind.     There is a small selection of beers on tap, but it is definitely a fully stocked Irish Pub. There is a small nook in the back corner of the bar that's more intimate. Perfect for a small group or date night.  The rest of the bar is usually filled with happy adults of all ages who just want to have a good time. A neighborhood gem."

Everything was so flavorful and delicious! They make the noodles fresh and it has the perfect chew. It's what I look for in my noodle dishes, the texture, and Very Fresh hits it on the spot. The very spicy Dan Dan are truly very spicy. It's packed with flavor though so while you're sniffling from the spices, you still get to taste your dish. Came back a second time for the cumin Lamb noodles in broth and honestly, it's hands down my favorite.  This bowl would be AMAZING on any cold day. It warms you right up and is very fragrant. Smashed cucumbers is another must order. It's crunchy, cold, and garlicky. Couldn't ask for a better option. Chicken wings were delicious as well! It's crunchy and seasoned very well.

Some of the noodles are on the spicier side and I have a medium spice tolerance; if the menu says the noodles are very spicy it means they are very spicy. The line gets incredibly long, but it does move relatively quickly and is worth the wait. The noodles are cooked perfectly and they have great options (even if you're vegan). It's tough to get indoor counter seating, but here's a good amount of outdoor seating and a park near by.What we ordered:* very spicy pork dan dan mian - it is in fact very spicy* tofu pudding drink - perfect pairing for spicy noodlesThings to know: * limited indoor seats* covered outdoor seating"

There's VERY limited seating - just a handful of countertop stools, but there's lots of seating outside (assuming it's not too cold!) I'll definitely be back!Ordered the below:-Dry Cumin Lamb: SO GOOD. One of their signature dishes - It's a must. You can choose dry or soup - highly recommend the dry version. I don't even like lamb very much but this was my favorite dish. The noodles are so doughy and chewy and it's so flavorful! -Tiger Salad: my second fave dish. It seems like such a simple dish, but it was so refreshing and flavorful. The cilantro isn't overpowering, lots of good sesame and vinegar flavors.-Dan Dan: tasty, but oily. If you have a low spice tolerance I don't recommend. -Beef Noodle Soup: this was actually my least favorite. Mostly because it just wasn't what I was expecting flavor wise. I was expecting more of the traditional Taiwanese beef noodle soup and it wasn't that."

They also after we ordered it was very quick for us to get our food. I like that they didn't have a lot of options on their menu. It was basically 4 items. You could see them making the noodles in the back she was slamming the door on the counter. It was crazy to see. The noodles were really stretchy. It was inside the Chelsea market. It is very busy on the weekend but a lot of shopping in a lot of food. Can't wait to come here in the summer to eat outside as well. Great energy all around and great space.

We got the lamb noodle soup bowl and it was mildly spicy. The noodles definitely have that hand-pulled texture/consistency and there was a generous portion of meat. It was very tasty and filling. The price is fair (~$15-ish?) for the meal and we split between two people. I'd recommend grabbing a beer to sip on at one of the other stalls before waiting to order.tldr; neat little hand-pulled noodle shop in Chelsea Market.

For Apps I ordered: Garlic Bread- definitely needed more garlic, tasted more like buttered bread with ParmesanMozz sticks- didn't have any cheese pull, but the taste was there I split meatballs and spicy rigatoni, portions are pretty hefty and fill you up. The sauce was to die for! And of course paired it all with a tasty aperol spritz."

There are also very few seats inside so it makes sense it took so long. The food, however, came out fast once we placed our orders which was nice. A total of 4 of us shared the pesto arancini, garlic bread, and rigatoni carbone. The pesto arancini was amazing and so flavorful. I didn't like that they only gave us 3 total balls though, seemed like a very small quantity. The garlic bread was ok- I didn't think it was anything special and would probably give it a pass next time. The rigatoni carbone was so flavorful and the pasta was perfectly al dente. This place has the same owners as Carbone. Would come here again for the rigatoni but definitely a pricier restaurant."

1462,VF3wSCRC3mE6JpBQPQXELA,12/18/2021,5 star rating,"This is my latest visit to the Parm restaurants and IMHO, by far, the best one. Celebrating 10 years being open, The Parm on Mulberry St is their crown jewel of the restaurant group.Walking in, there is a long bar with a few tables in the back. I grab a table at the bar and start talking to the bartender. I have a glass of Montepulciano as well as the fresh cut Mozz sticks. Comfort food with high end mozzarella, this is a nice starter to what's coming. People are starting to sit at the bar and I'm starting to notice the bartenders interactions with the customers. He's like a jungle cat, constantly covering is turf and making sure everyone has all the needs met. The trick is, he's also upselling the menu. And I dig that! We start talking about my sons wedding party. I told him, I found a custom suit place made in Scotland and show him what I bought. He tells me I look like a guy from the Sopranos. Haha! He's a good dude, I caught his name, Wemaldy? I hope I spelled this correctly.I tell him, I want to try the ziti. He says, first time here you want the meatballs. Also, get the Italian bread. Done and done!The garlic bread? I can tell it's a high end Italian bread. I ask about the bread and I'm told, hmmm we just switched vendors. It's not artisan like a  Jim Lahey - Sullivan Street Bakery bread. This is bread that I grew up with in Brooklyn, something I'd get at the corner bakery. Simply amazing. The bread also comes with a ricotta spread and a side of Marinara sauce.  Simple yet refined. The Meatball platter is brought to me. The mozzarella cheese is covering the meatballs like a warm blanket. And its not cut up pieces of cheese, its more like the plate was under the broiler and quickly melted. It's almost like a toasted marshmallow. Here is where Parm slays, the Meatballs are insane! I can already tell it's a meat blend of the highest quality. Listen, I had the meatballs at the Little Owl, Joey Campanaro takes second place to the Parm Meatball. Trust me, it was that good. Lets not forget the platter, it comes with a side of spicy rotini pasta that was touched with calabrian chili. Both my grandmother and mother couldn't make a pasta dish this good.There are two tourists at the end of the bar and we start talking about tourist destinations. The woman next to me was just enjoying her meal. She looks up and says she's from LA and lived here years ago. There is nothing like Parm in LA, This is the best Italian comfort food by far.I was about to get up and pay but Wemaldy said, you want to try the zeppoli here. Nah, I'm good. No Bill S, trust me. You want these Zeps. This bartender Wemaldy, I think you should make him a business partner at this location. He is the face you want your customers to see representing your business. Sure enough, I never had chocolate Zeppolis stuffed with chocolate. This dessert is insane! I had Zeppolis my entire life, never of had them of this caliper. I ate all of them.Parm, congratulations on 10 years of business. I had the best meal here."

We made a reservation for 4 on a Sunday and they seated us even without a full party which was nice. The interior was much larger than I expected and the decor is cute. We ordered the eggs benedict, shroom pizza, french toast, crispy potatoes, mimosas and sangria. In terms of drinks, I personally liked the mimosas more than the sangria. Overall, the food was good, but not mind blowing - which was fine given the price. I liked the shroom pizza the most. It's a lot of food so you'll definitely be full after; and hopefully buzzed :) I think they do 2 seatings for brunch - 11am and 1pm, so you need to clear out by 1pm if you choose the first seating. I recommend checking this place out; and definitely make a reservation in advance!"

My friend recommended this place so I didn't have much knowledge about this venue other then it's an Italian restaurant.Luckily my friend made reservation to this restaurant (highly recommended) because the restaurant was quite packed. We were seated in the back and their decor was lovely. Our waiter was also great. He kept it simple, took our order and that was it. As for food I ended up ordering their wood fire mushroom pizza and their hanger steak entree (medium rare). Pizza wise, it was okay. I felt it lacked the cheesy flavor that I craved and I could barely taste the truffle oil that they advertise so I wouldn't really recommend it.  However my hanger steak was absolutely fantastic. The meat just melted in my mouth. It was rich and buttery and melted right away with every bite. The side brussels sprout and mashed finger potatoes was a perfect compliment and I was utterly satisfied."

We came here for a holiday party which consisted of 14 people. We had a very nice overall experience.Because of the size of the party we did a pre fix menu which came with a few appetizers that were all served family style and a choice of 1 of 3 entrees. We also had a desert served family style. The service was very good, the wait staff was attentive, checking on you and not overbearing. We were not rushed and there was no time limit in the age of COVID. Speaking of which everyone was checked for vaccination status and ID which not every restaurant is doing today. I was glad to see this with the spread getting out of control again. The restaurant does get busy and after 7 pm was full. Nice crowd and there was decent spacing between the tables.They have a nice bar, ample seating and a wood burning pizza oven which is great for the pizza dishes they offer. The appetizers which included the salad which was great, meatballs, two pasta dishes one with lamb sausage and the pizza were the best part of the meal. The pasta was served al dente and I could have made the dish with the lamb sausage as my entree. The entree choices were salmon, hanger steak or a chicken dish. I went with the salmon which was good although It was basically the same as most good restaurants I've been too. They do offer some gluten free options on the menu and for the pizza.Desert was Nutella donut wholes. They had a good wine selection and we were able to sample them before committing to the 6 bottles we consumed LOL. I would go back again although I would order appetizers, pizza and wine. They were really good and would allow for a nice casual dinner. I would recommend you give them a try."

We received Bomboloni, Shroom Pizza, Black Currant French Toast, Eggs Benedict, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Crispy Potatoes, and Mimosa/Bellini Carafes. I loved how the Bomboloni was stuffed with nutella but I would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't both sweet and salty. The Shroom Pizza was pretty good but you notice the truffle oil more than the mushrooms. The ""Crispy"" Potatoes weren't crispy at all unless we were served the wrong ones or a different kind? But wrapping the Applewood Smoked Bacon around the potatoes made them taste so much better. Between the Mimosa and Bellini, I stuck with the Bellini. It tasted great and is stronger than ones I've had at other brunch spots, so kudos to Sotto13! The family and I had a great time celebrating my sister's birthday. The servers at our table were very efficient and attentive. We would have loved to stay a little longer but unfortunately there was a 1.5 hour time limit."

I have always been a huge fan of chipotle and it always disappoints me when certain locations do not match up to their other franchises.Due to my work location and apartment, I am able to either go to the chipotle location in either Cobble Hill or he 2 locations in Park Slope (the one near Flatbush/7th Ave and the other by 5th Ave/2nd).Right now my ranking is as follows:1) the Flatbush/7th location--great/friendly service, great food quality, and large/adequate helpings. The workers also seem to care about keeping the place clean.  Even though it's new, it's definitely your best option2) Cobble Hill Location. It gets 2 stars so that should say something. Excluding my last visit, the helpings (specifically the protein) is just plain sad. They barely give you enough to call a ""meat"" dish an actual meat dish. Also, the tables are never clean. I think I have had to wipe of tables each time I decide to dine in. Additionally, they never seem to have ice tea and are constantly out of most fountain drinks.3) the 5th Ave/2nd st location is last one the list so that tells you all you need to know.I will continue to go to chipotle and would definitely recommend that you do as well...I suggest taking the extra few minutes to get to the Flatbush location so that you can get your full moneys worth"

This isn't the best or the greatest pizza in NYC. it's good but unless you're sitting down and getting a pie, it might not be fully hot and there are so many pizza offerings in the city and in this area to try. First, I'm not a pizza snob, maybe just a snob. Most pizza has its charms and there are categories depending on your mood, time of day or night, convenience, price point etc. You cannot give a blanket review without context. So with that in mind, I'll give two, thick and thin references. The ""thick"" Sicilian style at Upside is very good and get it crisp, but when it comes to Detroit style thick, there's A Place in the jersey city heights called Low Fidelity that kills this style hands down. I mean, it's lifetime memorable and that to me is the sign of something great. My favorite ""thin"" in the city and perhaps the world is the tri pie at Joe and Pats on 1st avenue, they offer the same pie with three sauces (vodka, marinara, and pesto) at their other family related locations. It's not cheap or by the slice, but you can get it by the slice at their staten Island location. Happy pizza eating in the city that never sleeps and even the .99 cent a slice places satisfy."

They know me better than I knew myself in that moment.Two was the correct choice. This slice was unreal. Loaded with pep, greasy as can be, seasoned to perfection, with a soft-but-not-gummy dough. I am not even going to try and get to over the top descriptive here, because let's be honest, I ate this in my pajamas - drunk and alone in my hotel room. I might argue that is the best way to eat this pizza. No judgement, all enjoyment.If you're staying near Port Authority, the warm glow and scent of this spot will likely draw you in at some point.

I've been ordering the lunch special takeout from Pomodoro since 2007 when I worked in another career in The McGraw Hill building. Favorites back then were the Tuna Niçoise salad OR the half sandwich (chicken salad) and soup (tomato basil) lunch special, and still the same and delicious in 2022! The tuna salad kicks butt because it has my favorite things like sweet yellow raisins and dill on Tuscan wheat bread with some healthy greens added in. The tomato basil soup has a bright orange-red color, thick texture, and filled with flavor. Who doesn't love an Italian restaurant run by Asian Americans?! I do! Their shop sign is also really cute and iconic. They don't have non-dairy options for coffee which made me a bit sad, but that's pretty normal for most restaurants. There are a ton of coffee shops nearby that I'm sure serve coffee with soy milk. I'm so excited to be working back in the neighborhood and getting more opportunities to taste the deliciousness and speediness of Pomodoro!"

While it may not be much to look at the food was actually quite good and at a reasonable price. They normally had a lunch special and it was in the regular rotation every week.

Very similar to the traditional Italian flavors Ive had out in Italy. Best sando - prociutto + mascarponebest pasta - rigatoni w eggplant (must get)I dont want to over praise the rigatoni dish but omg its legit. The flavor profile is so perfect. The seasoning mixed with the tomato is delicate and so fresh. Its really damn good.

There are a decent amount of food options: pastas, salads, sandwiches. We came for Sunday lunch and the place was empty. You order at the counter and they bring the food to you if you eat in. The place isn't fancy at all so I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. I can see it being a popular lunch spot during the week.Chicken Dill Salad: Their most popular salad - chicken salad with crispy sliced green apples and mixed greens. So good. I liked it so much I considered taking one to go. There's a generous amount of chicken salad and the mixed greens were very fresh.Penne Alla Vodka: Another popular dish. This would've been too heavy eaten alone but was great paired with the salad. The vodka sauce was creamy and a little sweet and there was a fair amount of chicken. They even split the pasta into two plates for us!Looking forward to coming back to try their other dishes!"

We ordered cocktails to start and the drinks came out quite strong. I really enjoyed my matcha coconut cocktail, and my friend had an old fashioned. We ordered the spicy chicken ramen and two rolls of sushi. Sushi presentation was beautiful and came in this gorgeous boat like dish. The fish was fresh and tasted good. My friend's ramen was also well made with all the flavor notes. This place is great for a quick bite, casual weeknight dinner or lunch with friends. The street is a little tucked away so it's not crazy busy, easy to hear each other talk. Service was attentive without feeling rushed or ignored. Great place!"

There's no easy way to see who has been checked in or not. Clearly a very popular place. We were there for half an hour and did not get greeted or checked in. I ended up asking the bartender if we can just order drinks and she was polite and attentive from that point. You can book reservations on OpenTable but it's not reliable because I could see openings for every 15 minute increment and for hours but standing there, you can see you won't be seated. If I came here for food, I may have given a lower rating given the system for getting seated was unclear and people were told to just wait when folks asked for an update."

I also have the Ten Commandments of ramen, and I followed two of these commandments to a T to make this a perfect meal.-Thou shall order extra noodles when offered-Thou shall order extra egg with thy mealDoing both work perfectly. It already is a solid bowl, with a delicious broth, which already leads into another commandment.-Thou shall try thy broth without any additions or subtractionsThe broth is a perfect blend of savory and smooth. The chashu pork is good, but it could be better with one more piece. The fact that they use plenty of noodles in this bowl make up for it.The extra vegetables in it make up for any lack of meat. I am not one to slurp the rest of the broth, but I did honor one commandment to make this an enjoyable meal.-Honor thy ramen by slurping noodles liberallyThere is no doubt to do that is absolutely right."

But it was almost like we were ignored the entire time.Came in to do Restaurant week but decided to just order off the menu which turned out to be a better deal.The drinks we got were on their happy hour (12pm-7pm daily). While delicious, it took them a while to figure out our order. My friend's drink came and 15 minutes went by and I still didn't have mine. Was near impossible to flag down the 1 waitress for the entire place.The buffalo cauliflower came without the dip. Which arrived on its own later...But they were delicious even without the dip. Short rib buns- yum.Rolls were okay. I've had better. For cheaper. Ironic cause you would think they'd excel at this since it's a sushi bar.Oh and rainbow tartar- forgettable. Skip.They're opening a new location and debating checking that out..Hopefully they're better staffed. I'll go just for the drinks and cauliflower."

She almost pissed me off but I was in a good mood so let it go.I tried their seafood soup and it was pretty blend. Maybe it's the late night chef. They are famous for spicy (really spicy) chicken feet without the bones. This is good for your skin with collagen and gelatin but HOT as hell. I could not feel anything afterwards or the next day.  Yet, I kept eating like an addict.The night ended with some soju drinking, couple of trips to the bathroom and finally calling it a night when we realized the sun was coming up.

Ta-da, Incheon at your service.The place was almost completely filled. People were having a great time, drinking and eating. Placed in front of us were menus only in Korean, uh-oh. I asked for a menu in English, but they didn't have one. Since both my friend and I are avid Korean food lovers we just ordered our favorites--spicy tuna kimbap and cheesy dukbokki. And like many other Korean restaurants there were a variety of complimentary appetizers. The tuna kimbap was really good, fresh and flavorful. The cheesy dukbokki platter I think was meant to be shared between 4 people, it was huge! We ended up taking some leftovers home. My friend got the leftovers, and as I'm sitting here writing this review, I wished I had taken them instead :P"

My husband can't really eat spicy but for army stew he'll suffer. The portions are huge and not meant for one person...or even two. But with the soju special, I'll stuff my face until I can't remember the night :P Even though I've only had a few things off the menu, I'm sure the others are great as well...as long as you're drinking *cheers* :DParking is never a hassle like some other places in flushing.If you're not korean, good luck ordering.

So, we decided to check them out one weekend.The inside was smaller than I expected, long and narrow.  You can order fillings on a roll, bagel, or as make it a hero sandwich. They had so many cream cheese spreads, and also, vegan spread, Lox, egg, bacon, etc... They had a cute display on the wall with all sorts of bagels in rows of racks. Although, we didn't see too many bagels there. The male staff greeted us as soon as we got there, and told us that they don't keep too many bagels there on the racks, in order to keep them fresh. That makes total sense... So, if you don't see a particular kind of bagel you want, just ask them to see if they have more in the back. One thing about this place is that there is not spot to eat... Since it was a chilly day, we decided to just head home and have the bagels. The first bagel creation was chosen by my hubby. He went with Fresh Lox & Flavored Cream Cheese on Salt Bagel. And what kind of cream cheese did he get? Blueberry. Hmmm... Blueberry cream cheese with lox... It was actually not bad, the blueberry cream cheese was not so ""fruity,"" but cream cheesy. The bagel was good, but a bit tough.  I went with more breakfast type, Sausage, Egg, & Cheese on Everything Bagel. It was quite tasty, and the bagel but much softer. Maybe because it was toasted? I really enjoyed this bagel! The staffs here, especially the male staff who made our bagel creations, was really nice. We felt welcomed and our business appreciated.

Transcendent cream cheese? Ultra-fresh and plump lox? Bagels that seem like they just came out of the oven?Nope. The answer? $7.This place takes brazen to a new level. The bagels aren't any better than those at delis that dot the Inwood landscape. They just have more variety, and they hope consumers confuse that with quality.  There is actually way less lox than you get at some of the delis, and I could barely taste it against all the cream cheese. Here's the worst part, though. They have an expensive chicken noodle soup that's $7 (yes, I fell for the more expensive, must be transcendant fallacy). I ordered it. And I discovered that it's... REPURPOSED Campbell's ""classic"" chicken noodle's can soup! All they do is take the Campbell's and add more water to dilute it and make it less salty. I couldn't believe it, so I grabbed a can from my cupboard, opened, it up, and the contents are entirely identical. Unreal and anti-consumer."

The shell had that perfect kind of crunch you only find in fresh cannoli and the cream was perfect.

The counter person didn't know the name of the cookie! My favorite was the cookie lace cookies. They made a sandwich with the cookies with the chocolate inside. It was delicious. The rainbow cookie could have used more cake. it felt like too much chocolate and not enough cake but it was delicious nonetheless. We only got a few pieces of each to try it out. I would come back for the amaretti-ish cookie and the lace cookies for sure. Italian bakeries have the best pastries. For me, I like Italian bakeries even better than French bakeries...just sayin'.

It was also cold at the window seat in November. Service was generally indifferent. The lunch special with an appetizer or drink is a good deal, but standard things like eggs cost extra. The gyoza came out after the ramen. I ordered the sesame ramen thinking it would be packed with flavor but it was just ok. The noodles had a weird consistency, very chewy. They have the option to change the doneness of your noodles and make them more tender, and also to increase richness of the  broth, and I think that's a good way to go. There also wasn't quite enough broth for my noodles, weird. the waitress said people ask for more broth all the time and she has to explain they can't give more, maybe that indicates an issue? Lastly, there was a comically large amount of scallions. I meant I like scallions but damn it was overpowering both in texture and flavor."

1564,eyqVOLoOLrqZ98_QhdPXqg,11/5/2022,5 star rating,Possibly the best ramen spot.I have been coming here for my partners many hangovers and enjoyed every single one of it. I always get a classic rekka ramen with the thin noodles because it's a classic and it's just so good!My partner got the vegan version with thick noodles and this time was actually spicy when she asked for it! Previously she would always be getting not too spicy but this time they did it right and spiced all of ours perfectly! The vegan Chashu donburi is also really good but it will fill you up a lot while eating the ramen because the ramen is already so filling. The gyoza is good but not super mindblowing. I really like to have it in my lunch set when they have available since it pretty much comes with the free topping/ or a drink for 3 dollars!
1565,eyqVOLoOLrqZ98_QhdPXqg,12/20/2022,4 star rating,"Solid bowl of ramen. There aren't much extra toppings that come with it, but you can add for extra which was kind of a bummer. You can choose noodle types to be more el dente, and spice level."
1566,eyqVOLoOLrqZ98_QhdPXqg,1/5/2023,5 star rating,I think I found my new vegan ramen spot! Outstanding vegan ramen here with a full page of options on the menu! Very flavorful and a bowl for one is pretty filling. The wait was 45ish minutes to sit at the bar on a Sunday evening. It was so good that the wait was worth it! Staff was quick and able to explain the dishes. Had to remind my server to bring water for me at least 3 times until she finally did. I let it pass since I was in a ramen food coma. Finding seating around the bar or tables that can accommodate larger groups. They also have a single restroom.
1567,eyqVOLoOLrqZ98_QhdPXqg,3/4/2023,4 star rating,"3.5 stars: had the classic chashumen and there's not much to complain about here - it was all around solid, just nothing extraordinary. Nice flavored broth, egg & nori were good adds, and they give you a lot of chashu which is nice. If anything, I think I'd try the thick noodles next time or change how Al dente the noodles were cooked. But overall a decent quick bite of ramen!"

1569,eyqVOLoOLrqZ98_QhdPXqg,11/23/2022,3 star rating,"This is definitely a no frills place and since it's small it gave cozy vibes as well. Pros: i liked that you're able to see where you are on the waitlist via the Yelp app. Cons: I'm sorry but my broth barely had any flavor. I ordered the sesame broth ramen specifically because I wanted to try something new and it was just ok. It tasted watered down to be quite honest. The meat were thin slices and didn't have much flavor as well. I got the standard noodles and to me it had a weird consistency. They were very thin noodle and a bit chewy. Idk how to explain it but it was not enjoyable. You have to pay additional for each things like eggs and seaweed which I'd rather they included and just increased the prices a bit. I added an eggs in my ramen and again, the lack of flavor was disappointing because that's my favorite part.Overall, this place was just ok and I don't see myself coming back. I genuinely don't understand why there was a line for here."

The menu is straightforward and everything is a la carte. It can get pricey when you start to add various toppings, but it's standard these days. I got the tonkotsu with chashu and soft boiled egg. The broth was deep and delicious. I normally prefer curly noodles, but these firm straight ones were delicious. Very pleased overall."

1572,ygFhVaqGG6-nrTSG3OWolw,1/25/2022,5 star rating,"One of my favourite spots in Queens for sushi. We always do a la carte as the prices are a good bang for your buck and we are always stuffed, but they also have AYCE options. I always get the combo of 1 special roll + 1 regular roll which costs $16.95 and comes with a miso soup/ salad. Such a steal! Both the miso soup and salad are good and I alternate between the two depending on my mood. For the special roll I always get a Phoenix Roll which has a layer of seared salmon on top with an umami sauce on top. This roll is amazing and you can eat many pieces without getting tired of it as it doesn't feel too heavy. For my regular roll, I typically get a salmon + mango roll as I feel like the mango is a palette cleanser and very refreshing (especially as I'm trying everyone else's rolls too!). Would highly recommend as this place gives you a good bang for your buck and also has very fresh fish!"

Through our online order, we were able get a discount, either $8 off or get an extra roll if order is more than $50. It was a holiday and I understand that there was a tremendous volume of costumers ordering for pick-up, so they were a few minutes late preparing our order. We got our order and brought it to my daughter's place for a celebration.        My daughter and my wife loves a good food presentation or table set-up when we are celebrating. We brought our own personal sushi boat and my daughter carefully arranged our ordered rolls on it.         This restaurant has been consistent in making their sushi, maki, rolls, hand rolls and sashimi. What we ordered were so delicious, the subtle sweet, and sour taste of tropical fruit slices balances the light flavors of fish, eel, crab or shrimp. The way how they combine rice/texture, fruits, vegetables, seasonings, fish taste and special sauces merges together into one delectable and coherent entirety.       This continues to be my preferred place for Japanese food."

The food was absolutlely disgusting. The squid sashimi/ nigiri had a foul, fishy, bitter taste that was appalling. First round of ""yellowtail sashimi"" was decent so we ordered another round. Second round of yellowtail tasted like it was just defrosted right before we ordered it; super watery and a portion of it might've still been frozen.  Shrimp tempura had the skimpiest shrimp and the thickest batter that soaked up way too much oil. The takoyaki was a joke, you get a tiny piece of octopus and 99% batter that was way too doughy. Not only that we all left still hungry because we were all so disgusted, they added on an 18% tip on our bill without letting us know. We were about to add our own tips but thank god I took a look at the other reivews right before we paid or we would've ended up paying 38% tips. Beware of this shady restaurant."

For appetizers, I ordered the grilled squid and eel pancake. The squid tasted alright but there was a bit too much sauce. The eel pancake did not have much eel in it. Tasted the avocado more than anything. Because it was takeout, the pancake wrapped around wasn't crispy. For the main, I got two 3 roll combos and a pork katsu dinner box. The rolls are probably the only things that were better than their other food. However, it's still not the freshest and it tastes mushy at times. The pork katsu was flavorless and so thin. The tempuras were alright but not amazing. If you're looking for fresh Japanese food, unfortunately, this isn't the spot for me in terms of quality and food. But I do stil go back for a quick 3 roll combo dinner from time to time."

This was the first time I was trying Nepali food. There are so many foods within Nepali food that are variations of other Asian cultures so everything seemed familiar. The food is affordable, filling, and tasty. We ordered chicken momo (Nepali Style dumpling with Chutney), Tama Thali (chicken), and chicken Lollipop. The tama thali was an assortment of different sides with rice in the middle, beans, vegetables, spices, and chicken on the side. The service is perfect. I would definitely come back here."

This particular spot had lots of seating available as well as well-priced food.Decor here looks to be a random assortment of objects from Asia, covering up the old interior of the establishment. Lots of options on the menu, though wanted to try something regional - settled on the Veggie Momos ($8) to share and the Sukuti Thenduk ($11). Momos are soft and slightly crisped, with loads of cauliflower and onions inside - good with hot sauce. Sukuti Thenduk is a large bowel of dried meat, hand-pulled noodles, and some vegetables. Noodles are fantastic, very tender and easy to chew. Meat is hearty and spiced well. Wish there was more of both of them as most of the bowl is broth. The broth itself is okay, reminded me of basic chicken noodle soup.Solid meal and relatively quick service. Wouldn't order the soup again, probably stick with the momos."

We started with the fried calamari, then got the spaghetti alla carbonara and the tbone steak. We ended with the Italian cheesecake. The calamari tasted fine but you could tell off the bat it was the frozen kind, not a fan. My spaghetti was very tasty, well seasoned and cooked perfectly al dente. Would probably get this again if i went back. My husband's steak was very tasty too but had a little too much sauce which takes away from the steak flavor. The ricotta cheesecake was delicious, creamy with a mild almond paste taste. Service was great, everyone was very friendly and i would definitely go back."

Although I did order a second raspberry martini and my hubby told them up to the rim please as I noticed the others going to the different tables were and mine was not. The waiter took every precaution not to spill a single drop as he came over. I enjoyed the Caesar's salad especially the croutons. Mind you I am NOT a crouton eater but these were not the huge Lego pieces and maintained a very nice slight crunch. The special: Lamb Chops was fantastic!

Located in Queens, this is a warm Italian restaurant. Don't think it's a red sauce, chicken cutlet joint (Remember I mentioned the chefs came from Il Mulino?) but a tried and true Italian trattoria.I'm with my in laws and the four of us are seated. There has to be 12 tables in the main dining room, with more seating upstairs. My brother in law can get kinda crazy, he's been known to order the entire menu. This is not Olive Garden so I don't want to eat a mound of pasta. I'd like a small taste of the Bolognese pasta. The waiter mentioned a special pasta with truffle. My brother in law said both! Send both to the table to start. What the chef did was take 4 plates and put on both pastas! The fresh pasta with truffle had me swooning! Sooooooo so good. We also had a small Burrata with truffle oil tasting. Freshly made Burrata is one of my favorites, topped on arugula made it a nice side.My main course, the centrepiece of tonight's meal is a Sicilian classic, Branzino fish baked in salt. This is such a treat to cook fish and doesn't taste salty. What happens is, the fish is baked in the salt casing. When finished, the salt is cracked and the end result is fish that is moist and flavorful. The de-boned branzino isn't a thick filet so encasing the entire fish in salt makes it succulent. I was in heaven eating this dish. The dish came with roasted potatoes, I thought roasted potatoes was more of an afterthought. It would have been nice to have served this dish with asparagus or another vegetable.The service? I had multiple waiters visit us throughout our meal. total professionals and very sharply dressed. The bread basket they brought was fresh and tasty with the olive oil on the table.I'm packed at this point. My wife comes from the school, if chocolate isn't on my plate then it's not dessert. My brother in law ordered a flourless chocolate cake and a coconut sorbet that was served in a coconut shell. The flourless cake was dense and very decedent. The homemade whipped cream addition was a winner. The coconut sorbet was good, it's not something I'd typically have an a Italian dinner table.Il Falco has pictures of various movie and sport stars on the wall. Seeing the Sopranos cast dining and enjoying themselves makes me smile. This restaurant is a welcomed treasure in Long Island City."

Arrived around 9pm (I know it's a weekday but there were a shitload of people at the feast still, down the block and the feast starts at 6pm and ends at 11). The lady inside the cafe behind the counter we initially went to was nice. She directed us outside to get the ice cream cookie cake. Upon approaching who later said he was the owner: ""hi, do you have the rainbow cookie ice cream cake?"" ""No, no more left."" Reference above comment about the time & circumstances. Me (pointed to a different one): ""what does that one have in it?"" ""Cannoli cream."" ""Me: ""how much is it?"" ""[more than i was quoted inside]."" The whole conversation between me and this jubilant, face-in-phone owner was disinterested, monotone, sad, and screamed ""I don't want to be here, don't value your business and hard earned money on my overpriced feast pastries, and barely care enough to answer your questions."" My friend said thank you and have a good night after i bought the rainbow cookie cake and pignoli cookies and maybe he didn't know it was addressed to him, being the guy was so engrossed in whatever was happening on his phone, but he didn't even lift his head up. Everyone has a bad day. And yeah, i get it, you deal with assholes from the feast all day. Get over it, they're helping to keep your doors open. Maybe this was his bad day, but yeah, I was miffed by the interaction. There's no excuse to not appreciate business and at least try to put on a fucken smile in 2021. Ending this on a positive note, because that guy needs some positive vibes in his life - the rainbow cookie cake was excellent, it actually had the taste and texture of a rainbow cookie, not like the box cakes that just have rainbow cookie food coloring like some places. Haven't tried the pignoli cookies yet but they look good. Good enough that I bought a plastic container of them. Really nice little cafe that has good stuff. If it wasn't for the abhorrent interaction I had, this would easily be a 4-5 star review."

That's what I did.They are located right by the Old St. Patrick Cathedral/Basilica along a quiet street in Soho. I'd ordered a chai latte and was satisfied with it. I totally could taste the nutmeg and cinnamon as I was drinking it. And I had one of their almond horn cookie. Omg! It was yummy. I could literally taste the crunchy almond from the outside. Definitely chewy and gives a mild almond taste. These things can be additive.It's been a while since I scoped out a caffe in NYC.

When you enter this place, it feels very cozy. The lighting is dim and while it does feel ~romantic-, it mostly just feels comfortable. Everyone seems to be regulars and the servers seem to know a lot of people by name. This place was pretty lively when we went around 7PM on a Thursday, and most of the customers seemed older. Loved the vibe and the family feeling to this place. Made me wanna be a regular!We ordered a glass of wine each, a merlot and Shiraz. Both were filled to the brim, and I enjoyed the Shiraz.For an appetizer, we ordered the fried calamari. It wasn't too oily or salty and the tomato sauce that it came with was fresh and delicious. While it was fried, it didn't taste unhealthy. Thoroughly enjoyed this calamari and we finished it in like 5 minutes.For entrees, we shared a tortellini and an Osso buco. We were lucky in that the flavors of these two dishes paired really well! The osso buco was literally AMAZING - the meat fell off the bone. The bone marrow part was also good and it was just overall very well done and flavored. The gnocchi was a bit lacking, but regardless I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this dish. Tortellini was also great. Again, I enjoyed it more because of how well it went with the osso buco. The flavoring was good, not too salty, and a really great sized portion. Nothing to complain about here. At this point, we were SUPER FULL.... but for some reason, decided ordering a tiramisu was the move. It was definitely a decision I did NOT regret. The tiramisu was really large in size (which left us even fuller), but we finished the entire thing because it was GREAT!!!! Honestly, I have nothing negative to say about this place.

But if you're looking for beautifully prepared Italian food in a relaxed, quiet, comfortable, and candlelit environment and superb service, this is your place. As someone who eschews loud, trendy restaurants, this place is precisely my speed. We had the seasonal tasting and each dish was a hit. If there was any miss, I found the apple torte a bit bland and cloying. But that's a tiny complaint against a backdrop of excellence."

We were happily seated in a cozy corner with no other diners at the surrounding tables, so we felt very safe. I have many dietary restrictions, and the server and kitchen were extremely accommodating. The server checked back with me a few times to ask about items I hadn't mentioned. I couldn't eat the complimentary dishes and amuse-bouches, but my husband and daughter loved their pasta dishes, entrees, and desserts, as well as all the extras. The prix-fixe price was reasonable for the amount of food, but wine, bottled water, tea, coffee, tax and tip ran up the tab considerably."

1641,deOyLLCW_O8qEfRwCgRQbg,11/11/2022,5 star rating,The fluffiest and softest bread with so much cream filling! Definitely recommend their pie but their assorted other bakery items were just as good! They only take cash though so just don't forget that!
1642,deOyLLCW_O8qEfRwCgRQbg,2/18/2022,2 star rating,"I have been a long time customer here because I love their fruit cakes, Boston creme pies, and curry puffs. Their cakes have made me take the long trek out to Flushing. However, I am highly disappointed with my recent experience with them and their lack of hospitality in their customer service. I ordered a fruit cake for my birthday and told her I wanted an 8"" chocolate fruit cake. The worker (her picture is included below) asked if I wanted fruit with it, which on my mistaken assumption, I assumed was included in the price of the cake and she meant the fruit on the top, not fruit in the middle. Later she tells me the cake is $29, so I assumed that prices just went up because of Covid but when I looked at the menu, I realized that fruit was an extra $6, which she never mentioned. Am I supposed to know their cake prices off the top of my head like I work there? If the fruit in the middle is an extra charge, she should have mentioned it up front. Transparency is important in any sort of business. She said that I said that it was okay and that the cake was already in making. I told her no, I didn't want fruit in the middle and I had misunderstood that it was an additional charge. She then went on to start speaking in mandarin to her coworkers, which I completely understood. She was complaining and while I understand the frustration since the cake was already being made, she should have been upfront about the additional charge. She continued to talk in mandarin and to shake her head and mutter under her breath. I continued to tell her look, it's my fault I misunderstood but she should have been clear. Should customers be expected to know the prices of their stuff by heart?  All in all, I am saddened by the fact that the workers, not all of them, just that one in the picture, has such a poor attitude and is not willing to acknowledge her mistake when I admitted it was my fault I misunderstood but I am not entirely in the wrong. Talking bad about people behind their backs (or in my case, right in front of me!) in another language and her nonverbal actions showed her lack of professional demeanor. If I did business and acted the way that she did in front of my patients, I would get chewed out immediately. Sadly, I dont think I will be returning here. While I love their cakes, their customer service has totally gone downhill. They are also skimping on the cream in their cakes. While there used to be cream all around and underneath the fruits, they are putting less, which ultimately makes the cake not look as nice. I hope you guys at the bakery improve the customer service and learn to teach your workers to be as transparent as possible to avoid future misunderstandings like this. And don't assume that people can't understand what you're saying behind their backs."

I was floored to hear the employee say, ""$19""! $19?! I understand eggs are super expensive but since they will go back down in price very soon, hopefully, will this price for one of the best cakes ever go back down in price as well? I can bet it won't and unfortunately, I won't be paying $19 for this cake or any other item (including the sponge cake that was over baked on display) at Yeh's in the future."

My family and friends have been enjoying them for decades.For a recent birthday, I picked up a strawberry flavored cake and it was loved by everyone as usual. Due to the pandemic, it's been a while, but the consistency is always there. It's definitely not the most creative of all cakes, but it's a crowd pleaser every time."

I'm not a huge sweets person so I love that the cream on the cake isn't super sweet but very light. The cake texture is also so airy and moist. Today I tried the vanilla cake for the first time and also loved it. I make sure to call ahead and they always have the cake ready for me by the time I arrive. You can also add a note on the cake for special occasions. The fruit on the cake is also super fresh. Their prices did increase a bit but still worth it in my opinion. I've been coming here for years and love the consistency. Highly recommend

We often tend to get this cake for any special occasion just because of the wallet friendly pricing, and we've never been disappointed. I often scrape off the excess cream off my cakes, but for their strawberry cake and Boston pie, I can't help but indulge in all of it! So so goodddd!"

Delivery - I requested my order to be delivered by 1:30pm. My phone rang at 1:29pm. Enough said.The sandwich - Amazing. I highly highly encourage the Turkey and Salami Routine I put together. If you love a spicy Italian this is the one for you. But again, options and combinations are endless. Price - My sandwich totaled to $10 which isn't that bad. I ordered a side of coleslaw and that was $3 which I thought was a bit pricey. However once I took a bite of my sandwich nothing mattered and it was worth every penny.Can't wait to keep trying different sandwiches!"

My company has been ordering from BB for the past couple months.  For the most part, they did a commendable job at getting all (15) of our orders correct in the beginning. But then one day, they somehow got all of orders wrong with missing ingredients and mislabeled sammies. So I emailed them to complain (twice).  That's when it happened. I became an enemy of the state and on their official s**t list. For the next 4 weeks of orders (no joke), they conveniently messed up the order under the name ""Alex"".  Adding in unwanted jalapeños, forgetting cheese, and filling up only half the sandwich with protein are just a few of the ""errors"" that ensued. I started to become suspicious...so as any sane person would do, I ran a personal A/B test. I ordered under a pseudonym and low and behold, my sandwich was perfect to the T.  Conclusion:*These sammies are no doubt delicious, but damn, they did me dirty.

Once our guests dug-in, no one could stop talking about how delicious each-and-every sandwich was...seriously impressive that hundreds of sandwiches could each be that well-made.

The wings were good, the burrito nothing like the ones they used to served when Tony was in charge, those were a tasty and enjoyable burritos. Now I also ordered a tres leches cake which not only looked disgusting and old but tasted horrible, I don't know how anyone could call that a tres leches cake and charge $4.00 for that disgusting thing, any local bakery would sell you a better tasting tres leches than this so called ""Jessie's Fine Desserts"" place. It's a shame because I used to love the food from there, but I guess Tony took the good recipes or the good cooker with him because now I won't only eat from there anymore, I won't recommend it to anybody."

Nothing about Sevilla ever changes, which is one of the things I adore about the place.There is nothing fancy. Matter-of-fact the decor looks as if it may be from the early 1970s when the current owners took over the establishment.  To those who are not aware, Sevilla opened its doors in 1936.  86 years. They're doing something 'right'.Is the Paella 'authentic'?  I have no idea. Yes, it is served in a cast iron pot. Is that how it is made in the kitchen? Again, I have no idea.  Is it salty? Sure.  Go to Spain and you'll see just how salty Spanish food can be. With that said, I never leave Sevilla feeling like I need to drink a gallon of water afterward. But yes, it's salted (noting his as a response to other reviews).We always start with a plate of Manchego, a Pitcher of red Sangria, and a second appetizer that fits the mood of the evening.  We share lobster, chicken, and sausage paella.  The meal comes with a side salad with French dressing which looks like something your Mom may have put on the table as a kid in the 1970s (at least my Mom did) but is always surprisingly refreshing.Our waiter(s) this past visit were outstanding. Fun, cordial, and served with a genuine smile.  The atmosphere was lively and quite honestly, I was thrilled to see the restaurant totally full on a Tuesday night!Thanks again for a wonderful pre-birthday dinner, Sevilla. Cannot wait for my next visit!"

Please try the almond cake too!"
1672,RQi2YmAkk8g9WdNStAhfbQ,12/23/2022,2 star rating,Fell off a cliff about 7 years ago...did the chef leave.We keep checking in every few years hoping the old flavors will come back...so far no luck.
1673,RQi2YmAkk8g9WdNStAhfbQ,2/6/2023,1 star rating,"Not a good place to eat paella it was cheap,lacked seafood and the lobster was disgusting. I feel you could spend your money somewhere else and get your money's worth.Trust me I gone to all types of paella restaurants and this one was the worst."
1674,RQi2YmAkk8g9WdNStAhfbQ,9/26/2022,1 star rating,"Absolutely disgusting! Was so psyched about going here due to the great reviews. But let me just say that these people must have dined somewhere else. Ordered the Paella, the seafood tasted like freezer burn and a fish tank. The lobster was dry and gummy. The Paella is not a Paella at all, its just rice and protein. Not even made in the right pan. Made in a pot. Just find somewhere else to go. We tasted everything and left. What a disappointment. Too bad I have to give them one star. Yuck!!"
1675,RQi2YmAkk8g9WdNStAhfbQ,12/6/2020,5 star rating,"It's true: I've been in love with Sevilla for a very long time. From food, to cozy style to service- it's what always brings us here. Tried other Spanish restaurants in the area but Sevilla is our trustworthy blueprint. If you have a need to dine outside, by all means- Sevilla now has that option- that's if weather is cooperating. It was strange seeing the middle row where 2-seater tables filled up in the past, now completely bare providing much needed 6' distance between the W. 4th side booths and the bar. There's bar seating (I think?), as well as window 2-seaters on the Charles St. side. We always go traditional: Red Sangria pitcher with sweet notes- yet super powerful, hubs likes the Chorizo tapa, I get Gambas al Ajillo and share the Paella Marinera (with no poultry or pork). If that doesn't appeal to you, go full bonkers with other Spanish items on the menu. As with small portions during the pandemic, the shrimp although tasty- weren't the large size they'd serve in the past and are now medium. Paella- is still the same price, still tastes wonderful- but pot is smaller. Regardless, this place for me is doling out equal parts tasty and well-prepared food for eons in this still.. buzzy spot."

1677,k-voh5qVtIlki3fL8EtqIg,6/14/2022,2 star rating,"This use to be a place where I use to take my kids to when they were smaller. I went just recently . The place had an odor same as the Applebee's in the  gateway mall of rodents have a home there. Against my better judgment I decided to have pancakes, turkey bacon and coffee. My pancakes were under cooked and the hot coffee sucked. Cheap coffee. The turkey bacon was fine . My waiter was very nice and the manage was nice too. They just need a makeover. Kitchen staff need to know how to cook simple food as well. So sad this place is not the same."
1678,k-voh5qVtIlki3fL8EtqIg,1/31/2021,5 star rating,"Although this IHOP located on Flatlands Avenue in Brooklyn is far from my residence, their consistent food quality, taste, and ease in ordering take out for pickup via telephone is without question incredibly better than attempting to order anything via telephone from IHOP's other Brooklyn locations.  The Flatlands Avenue IHOP Team are great in taking my order and having it ready for pickup within the quoted time of completion.On every occasion when we have picked up our food, this particular IHOP provides only margarine instead of butter for take out orders.  The taste of butter is definitely better over IHOP's delicious Milk & Cookies or short stack pancakes.  Other than our butter preference, this IHOP provides excellent customer service for those morning take out orders.  My continued thanks to the Flatlands Avenue IHOP location for their continued excellent service today and always."
1679,k-voh5qVtIlki3fL8EtqIg,4/2/2018,5 star rating,"I must say this IHOP location has done a complete 360. The interior has been updated, the staff trained to be more professional and the managers are elbow deep with helping the servers get orders out. I love it!  My 6 year old asked if we could please celebrate his birthday at IHOP. I was happy to obliged. Most kids ask for a car on their birthdays. This simple request was not a tough one. The service was amazing from the door, to being seated and to the waiter OMAR, who made all the guest he was servicing smile. We kept it pretty simple, pancakes, fries, GREAT coffee, chicken tenders and something new off the menu - pancake sliders. NO complaints from my kids, means great food. Shot I don't have a single complaint.The best part is they all sang a very HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my sweetheart, and that absolutely made his day and mine. That does not reflect on me giving it 5 stars but truly for the updates they've made in service.ENJOY! you will not be sorry. OH and before I forget, Sunday's are pretty brutal due to the church members that flock in 100 at a time."
1680,k-voh5qVtIlki3fL8EtqIg,5/2/2021,1 star rating,They brought us the wrong order. The pancakes tasted very salty like they cooked them on the same grill as the meat. The food just did not live up to expectations. Also their set up is not socially distant!
1681,k-voh5qVtIlki3fL8EtqIg,8/17/2020,1 star rating,"Racism at the location.I have never seen this amount of racism and segregation ever in this modern times. My wife and I went to the Ihop (we are Mexican American, neutral color of skin, closer to white). And we both were served plastic dinnerware, coffee on a paposr cup, orange juice on a plastic cup. And all around us, AfricanAmerican, and none white color were given proper glassware for their water, juice, drinks, mug for coffee etc. I felt treated different and alienated from the rest id the customers. I would give a 0 to this location. Also the food was improperly served. The  food didn't look like the images. And to add, the omelette was missing the sour cream advertised in the pulled pork omelette. Plus the pancakes missed the creme Brule. Avoid this place if you want to avoid racism behvaior."

Of course she wasn't in a good mood as a result of the incident which transpired prior to us arriving to IHOP, however, a combination of good food and great customer service was able to get her smiling again. I had the cheesecake pancake with turkey sausage and scrambled eggs topped with cheese. She had pancake breakfast as well. We were so delighted with the food. Some IHOP's have disappointed us in the past but this one always seems to deliver. You can't go wrong by dining here. The have a world class staff.My server on this occasion was Martina, Server 1114. Go see her. She is super cool. She will put a smile on your face. And hot food on your table. You just can't ask for a better server than her."

From the time they've opened my first encounter was with the manager Ariel who was very inviting personable and made sure that we were taking very good care of he didn't know me he just wanted to make sure that we were in a good place and that our waitress was doing the right thing by us.

I've went about 6 times because i give places a few chances but only once did i have a good server, i dont remember her name but yes she was young but did well and carried herself well (light skin with glasses). Any other time i had to get the manager to service me. often you get seated and then forgotten about for a good 25 min before someone comes and checks on you (if they even come and check, ive had to get up myself n go to the manager and then he would take my order) and even when its dead somehow your food comes out cold. 6/6 times ive went the food was always cold and had to get sent back. Presentation goes a long way too, workers walking around with Bonnets and Durags is not professional... Also ladies stop trying to force edges, the install was poor get some of ya money back."
1686,nBoOm-TAhRvbcDkHfKOwGg,11/21/2017,4 star rating,"I've had a TON of palak paneer from so many places & Swagat does it right, too. It's the expected North Indian dish with little variance thanks to widespread regional adoption in the metro NYC region. Thankfully, it wasn't too oily and not too salty, just the way I like it. The basmati rice, with whose quality I'm also frequently familiar, was likewise quality, fresh, fluffy, fragrances with light flowers, and not a grain gone wrong. I loved eating the take-out in my office afterwards, not too fragrant which was helpful, though palak paneer usually isn't.Superb easy location just 1 block from Penn's SE corner, a great alternative to all the pubs otherwise. The layout is small but semi-new finishings and an open spacious architecture helps to make it feel bigger than actually. There're about a dozen tables seating 4 each thus plenty of seating. No bar, no outdoor seating, are on tons of online delivery/pickup services, staff seem nice, hours are plentiful, eager to try their many other items.Aside, being inside makes feel like I was here many (8) years ago, though that might not be as few restaurants of this size are open continuously that long in this high turnover area, sadly."

I was actually followed by crazy person, and the manager took the time to make sure I was safe. The samosas are amazing, the sauces beautifully done. Anyone complaining about the ""décor""- go elsewhere and make room for us who look for food and not ""ambiance"". The servings are great, the menu varied and authentic. I feel like the people bashing this place are pure snobs. You'd rather pay for décor than a great authentic meal served by genuinely nice people. This is my weekly go-to spot as long as I'm in this neighborhood."
1688,nBoOm-TAhRvbcDkHfKOwGg,6/28/2021,4 star rating,"This restaurant has the best byriani. The chicken byriani has chunks of quality white meat. And its perfectly seasoned.  Sometimes a restaurant will use the left over, unedible bits because its mixed into the rice. I haven't tried the other dishes yet but I imagine the chef will continue with the same quality. If you are looking for ambiance, this is not your place. Its plain and simple but I go for the food. Plus the prices are very reasonable."

Again, quite tasty. I ordered naan on the side and it complemented the main dish well. Mango lassi was exceptional. Finally, the Ras Malai had just the right sweetness. The establishment seriously lacks in ambiance, and the servers are very nice but not so attentive."

Not only was the food extremely terrible, they didn't even try to make it the right way and half assed the entire thing. Didn't even use the right contents to make it.I wanted papdi chat, they put chola from chole bhature in it, no potatoes, no onions, no bhujiya, no meetha chutney. They did let me get samosas for free because I refused to eat that crap."

The price menu was moderately priced but kinda high but in nyc it's like to eat you spend 20$. Easy. I ordered the Jerk Salmon Wrap after reading raving reviews of others and also because I prefer fish as my meat base. I was helped by Jermaine who was very welcoming and greeted me upon entry and another gentlemen with highlighted dreads. My and my pup felt good and the young lady who made my meal did her thang. It taste SO GOOOOD! I was shocked actually it has a chipotle mayo dressing with diced pieces mangos in the salads and on a whole wheat wrap.  I also got the reg size sorrel & mixed itch with passion fruit lemonade and it was the BOMB. I LOVE SUPPORTING ,BLACK OWNED BUSINESS THAT ARE RUN WELL AND WHERE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE MAIN FOCUS.  ALL I ASK IS THAT THEY CONTINUE TO KEE THE FOOD TASTING AS GOOD AS IT DOES NOW & continue to have the experience"

I came last night 7/30/21 for their premiere of having cocktails and happy hour. The DJ was good.Let's talk about everything I've tried here. Their jerk salmon wrap is divine. Like it had pieces of mango in it. The wrap was so flavorful and filling. I've had the rice bowl with the sweet chili shrimp and I the chicken, with the sides of rice, spinach made with coconut milk ( so good), and cabbage, and plantain. I order the sweet chili over the chicken.I'm obsessed with their ginger lemonade prefer over the sorrel. As for the cocktails I like the rum punch. I also tried the ginger pineapple with tequila and the strawberry passionfruit with rum.They make really good juices that's are addictive.This is owned by West Indian mother and son and they are always so friendly and smiling.Come support this local cafe.Follow my food Instagram: @eatingwithetienne"

As soon as there was a day I didn't want to cook lunch, I ordered their tempting jerk salmon wrap and saltfish wrap for pick up. The wraps were delicious. The mango sauce is on another level and the food overall tasted fresh. It was perfectly curated. The downside is that it does take AWHILE. I took my time picking up and when I arrived myself and two other patrons were waiting for our food for about 30 minutes. 30 minutes past the pickup time. I love their food. I love all the community events they have (check them out on their Instagram) but hoping their wait times improve. Definitely will be back.Oh, they are innovative! An espresso shot with beets?!"
1699,xYOJtt8WH7C9WPhohqEbcg,3/5/2023,5 star rating,This is the best place for coffee and breakfast in PLG! The owners and staff are so kind and account for the little details. The coffee is great and the food is sooooo good. I love the atmosphere as well - perfect for getting some work done as it is relatively quiet and has comfortable seating options. Their everything seasoned croissant with chive cream cheese in the middle is my absolute favorite.

Well....it is my only favorite cafe in the Little Caribbean area because I am not terribly familiar with the area. But regardless, it was the type of place I walked in and felt very very comfortable.I tried their hot cocoa and I could not recommend it more. The portions are healthy and the whipped cream makes it oh so delicious.I probably got lucky getting in during a non-busy hour, but it was VERY comfortable being there. I could go there to work and ACTUALLY focus - very rare these days. Their service is really great too. The staff is very friendly and helpful when you have any questions about their menu, wifi, etc.I love Lips and I will certainly be back."

The ginger pineapple drink is delicious and I never drink anything with ginger but I enjoy it. I came here with my bf to talk and we were there for 3 hrs. No one rushed us out or gave us side eyes. Ppl come here to do work (for me the music is a little too loud for me to focus but nothing headphones can't fix.) They also sell alcohol btw and a variety of food.

They take healthy food and elevate it with a Caribbean twist. My favorite item is the bake and saltfish. The bakes are made fresh and are delivered nice and warm and the saltfish has nice flavor! I was thinking about that bake all day after I ate it lol!I was a little disappointed when I ordered my shrimp wrap and noticed how small of a portion it was. For $11.99 plus tax, I was expecting something more hearty or filling. Despite the small size, the flavor is good.The food will take a little longer because everything is made fresh, so I usually will come and order and step out to run a quick errand.

While it did have coffee (+ other drinks) and a floral display but eh, it wasn't all that. Most of the seating, which there isn't much of, was taken but luckily a table indoors freed up. Has more of a to-go vibe which could explain the service not feeling as amicable as in other places. The atmosphere wasn't that comfortable to chill in, probably just not my vibe.I went for the Butterfly Pea latte while my friend got the beet latte, both were hot for the latte art but it was the basic latte art. There were caffeine-free or sugar-free and (probably why) I didn't like either of the lattes.I had a sugar craving from the tea and we got a chiffon cake to share. Highly recommend NOT to get, it was so dry. I thought the cake was supposed to be fluffy... I only managed to finish with the matcha spread on the side.

The botanical vibe full of succulents morphs into a fluffy, light and posh side of subdued fresh and dried florals on the other side of the small shop. My rose latte was not gimmicky at all. For $6 (not bad for what it was), I had a stunning latte, perfectly mild on the rose. An excellent latte in quality of milk froth, art, and actual espresso. Wifi was meh, but other than that, fantastic spot. Clean bathroom as well."

But I will give plugs for my favorite drinks: The rose latte and lavender latte (either hot or iced).The pastries are also yummy! I can personally recommend the cream cheese danish and palmier.A happy respite for anyone! Indoor seating where you'll be sitting close and surrounded by plants. Outdoor seating where you'll also be sitting close and can enjoy people watching.

It's not so loud to the point where you can't hear the person next to you, which I really like. The interior design is so well done -- there are plants everywhere and a bouquet area in the back if you wanted to buy flowers! I got the lavender latte and I'm very impressed with the taste. I'm not the biggest coffee drinker, but I would come here again with a friend just to try out the different drinks. The latte was the perfect balance of coffee and floral and meshed well together. The presentation is also gorgeous, I almost didn't want to ruin it."

There are sooo many amazing flowers and amazing decor across the entire restaurant. The menu and service was fantastic (although i did feel they were a bit understaffed for a crowded saturday afternoon). It was very packed, and nearly no-seating space indoors. Although the decoration was amazing, it also felt a bit cramped as I was standing waiting for my order.The latte art is beautiful and the staff was really kind and efficient. It is a bit harder to get work done/study in this cafe as it is a bit of a rush and there is so much happening (felt very new-york-ish). There is a bathroom with a great scent! No outlets, and again lots of people moving in-and-out. Service was nice, no-nonsense, and fast. I got the rose latte, it was ready within minutes, piping hot, and tasted absolutely delightful."

Like a Pokémon Trainer and their Pokédex, I stopped and used my phone accessing Yelp to find out more about this place on the spot. ""Ooooo it has a lot of good ratings. Let's go on in!"" Lol.Wowzers, this is a true Rainforest Cafe as there are plants everywhere! They're all very well-kept too. In the corner there is even a functioning florist shop. Wanted to chill here a bit (I had some extra time!) so I ended up ordering a rose latte and everything bagel. Beautiful latte art but the taste itself was pretty standard for a latte. Was still comforting though on a kinda-chilly morning. Although the bagel was soft it was cold to the touch (wished it was heated up a bit). Man at the cashier seemed a bit disgruntled.A very unique cafe for sure. Overall I'd say come here to sit and relax while being among a bunch of pretty plants (don't forget to check out the small upstairs area! Really steep stairs though). Latte is good to order mainly if you're into taking artistic food pics or just craving a latte in general. 4-ish stars rounded up!"

My boyfriend ordered the lavender latte and he adored it. I thought the matcha latte was not sweet enough and the steamed milk taste was too overpowering. The drinks were very pretty though! the cafe itself was beautiful and the vibe was immaculate!

I had no intentions of coming here until I needed to kill some time while I wait for my Ess-a-Bagel order (5min walk from Remi). So coffee it was! The CUTEST interior! It's a crossover between a coffee spot and a floral shop which really adds to the floral theme in their coffee. It just makes it feel so... right. The drinks were not only stunningly decorated, but they tasted just as good as they look. The notes of floral rose and lavender really stand out in the coffee without being toooo overbearing. They nailed it! Perfect spot to romanticize life."

This is not a place you're going to eat at or order from and think about in the future like ""wow... that sure was a good meal.""They have tons of great menu options but are TERRRRIBLE at preparing seemingly everything they make.I've ordered from this place on nearly a half-dozen occasions and the result is always the same:  The food will come to you and you'll realize just how poorly it was prepared in the kitchen. If I get a salad with dressing already inside of it, it comes OVERLOADED with dressing... like nearly half a bottle of whichever dressing you choose ... if you order dressing on the side... they don't give you enough, which is just a bad.If I get a sandwich, it will be prepared with as little care and attention to proper seasoning as possible.  I decided to give this place one more try so I ordered one of their $10 Tuna Melts... the mayo tastes like they've been keeping the tuna pre-made in the fridge for a little too long... like it's beginning to turn... and I don't know what spices they used but whatever it is... it's just... aweful.... granted I'm an expert when it comes to making tuna, but I know this and so I'm usually quite forgiving when eating it made by someone else.... and this... this abomination of a melt was NOT worthy of the name ""tuna.""Someone needs to come into this place and teach the people in the kitchen what ingredients to use, how to properly store food and for how long.I don't see how I could order from this place again.  I gave them too many tries to get it right already and if they can't even handle making a salad or a tuna melt properly, I just don't see the point anymore.   I'll give them a star for prompt and friendly delivery men."

1736,7N9guQY_2a3gXXIlBQGKtA,1/7/2023,3 star rating,"Walked by here several times & finally decided to try it out on a late Saturday morning for brunch. I'm going to assume that they were short staffed because the service was really inattentive. We stood right in front of the ""please wait to be seated"" sign for a little over 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us, after walking by us &  going to the people behind us in line to help them first. I thought the service would improve once we were seated, but it was less than average & took so long to get the check, really felt kind of ignored from start to finish. I think it would be better as an order at the counter type of deal. But... the food was great! That's really what I came for & care about. Everything was perfectly cooked, fresh, & tasty. Prices & portions are decent for NYC too. 4 stars for the food & ambiance. -1 star for lack of service. 3 stars overall."

This is the type of spot you could go to every week for brunch after a fun weekend (I usually go every Sunday and try something new!).Brekkie Roll: this was just amazing. It has everything you could ever want: smoked bacon, hash browns, cheese and a fried egg. This is definitely one of my favorite items on the menu.Smoked Salmon Lox Toast: I honestly did not expect anything from this but I can say that I was pleasantly surprised. Refreshing, flavorful and just overall really really good!Mushroom Toast: This is my new favorite dish ever! I literally get it ALL the time. The combination of feta and mushroom was honestly the best surprise ever. This toast is absolutely delicious. An absolute must get!Fried Chicken Sandwich: Not bad at all. Not the best chicken sandwich in NYC but it definitely hits the spot. It is the right level of spicy, and the perfect level of crispy.Their avocado toast is a staple on their menu and its toppings change every couple of months - never gets boring! This time, I got to try their winter toast with apple, red watercress, feta and sesame crumble on sourdough. This was actually one of my favorite avocado toasts in the city.Get the sweet potato fries!! TRUST ME.Hole in the Waffles: Taking a bite of this dessert is like tasting happiness.

The avocado smash came with a slice of multigrain bread with an avocado smash on top. I loved my lunch! My friend had an impossible burger. They made it possible for her. My dish looked great, and the taste was up to par. Her dish looked great as well. She said it was fantastic. Mission accomplished! I had my unsweetened black iced tea with my lunch. I want to come back and try other dishes. The funky place with an above-average noise level is perfect for brunch or lunch. Thanks!"

The decor is also really pretty inside and thankfully I got a table almost immediately after reaching. I got the chili scrambled eggs - literally one of the best ones ever. I've had scrambled eggs at almost every brunch spot I've been to, and I can definitely vouch for the ones here compared to most others. The eggs were perfectly cooked - not too dry or raw and chewy (usually the issue I face at most other places; I'm quite particular about my eggs!). The green harissa on top was perfect. It added so much flavour to the eggs and sambal paste on the side gave it a good amount of spice - not too much at all. And the sour dough bread was an absolute hit!"

The restaurant was empty but, they had a steady stream of deliveries and takeout orders. The restaurant had 3 tables with two chairs each and a hand sanitizer bottle by the entrance. The table service was non-existent. They took orders and dropped off food and the bill. They didn't check in and they forgot items when we ordered. They two women spent most of the time chatting among themselves or handling customers that came in. We got an order of guac and chips ($7.50) to share. The chips and guac was okay but, nothing noteworthy. We noticed that the chips seemed homemade but, they didn't add any salt to them. When added green and red sauce to the guac and it made the guac more flavorful.Little Ram got an order of goat tacos for $13. They thought it was okay but, they were hungry after consuming the tacos. I felt for that price they should have included a small side.I ordered the chicken tinga bowl for $9 (not including additional add-ons). I added in sour cream and guac which cost extra. Personally, I felt that this bowl was lacking for this price point. The flavor was decent but, I felt like there was more lettuce than rice and sour cream shouldn't be extra. I honestly felt like I was eating a salad and not a rice bowl. Jammy Jam got an Al Pastor bowl for $9 (not including additional add-ons). They ordered guac and fajitas veggies for $1.50-ish for each add-on. They said the flavor was lacking but, that it was tasty. They said there wasn't anything that was noteworthy. They felt that Qboda has better flavor and value for the price point.We also ordered horchatas ($2.75) and it was okay. My friends remarked it tasted like weak tea. The churros for $8 was okay. I am not sure if the churro had a filling or if it was under cooked. I thought it was okay but, Little and Jam enjoyed them. I found the chocolate dipping sauce to be very rich and strong. I am kinda torn. I like that this is a cute neighborhood spot but, I felt that the flavor was lacking and not noteworthy.  There was nothing that made this spot stick out from other places. The prices are affordable but, quickly add up when you add in extras like onion/peppers, pico de gallo, sour cream, and guac. I felt like some of these items should be included in the cost of the bowl because the bowl itself seemed a bit meager by itself."

The consommé is the only thing that saved this dish. The quesadilla was nothing but lukewarm chicken and cheese inside a flour tortilla with no attempt to toast, warm, or cook the tortilla in any way. Maybe your experience will be different than mine. Eat at your own risk."

First of the food here is not made w ""love"" it's made w the quickness and you can tell as soon as you start eating. Speaking of the tacos, the tinga polo is not seasoned and needs salt! Just bc it's spicy doesn't mean you can omit the salt. The shrimp tacos are most definitely frozen small farm raised shrimp (about 4 per taco) the chorizo is extremely greasy (this is normal) but they could probably leave some of the oil behind when plating. You won't get any (green) verde sauce unless you ask. Spanish beans and rice side: came a complete mess. Again did not take the time to close it right on a Tue. afternoon. Plus side is the tacos are decent size (besides the shrimps ones)"

The burrito bowl was generously filled with meat but kind of lacked flavor and you would need to add more toppings to spice up the dish. If you want to add additional things to the bowl you have to pay per item unlike qdoba or chipotle. And it adds up pretty easily. I wasn't blown away by the flavor and prob wouldn't order again.

As a heads up, if you check-in on Yelp, you can get a free side of chips & salsa with an order over $15. Also, on Taco Tuesdays, their tacos are cheaper (~$3). For the price, I think the quantity was great, but I do think the meat and salsa verde in the tacos could have been more flavorful."

Definitely preferred the thin crust to traditional, as the proportion of dough to other ingredients was a better fit for me. This place is always packed, as the seating is very limited. Always a line at the door, waiting to be seated, so plan accordingly. Delivery or take out takes some time, so learn patience in the face of hunger.Prices for pizza pies are not cheap, for SI."

As we walked in, a man who we think might be the owner, saw us trying to figure out where to sit. I was with my elderly mother, he looked at us and smiled and said, ""sit over here near the pizza ovens. It's very warm."" I really appreciated that so much since it's December. :-) The food... it all tastes like food that you are served at an Italian family member's home. I've been to Italy and rave about the food there of course ... So if you're looking to not have to travel too far, your experience at Pizzeria Giove in New Dorp will either take you back to Italy or make you feel like you're there. The ingredients taste very fresh and natural. It is outstanding! Some of our favorites are the zucchini al forno (layers of thinly sliced zucchini with ham and an amazing cheese, lightly breaded golden brown...), and the pizza A La Barese (thin crust white pizza with fresh mozzarella, broccoli rabe, and  crumbled sweet sausage). The crust is perfectly cooked in their special pizza ovens. It's magical! Heaven on Earth! We highly, highly recommend Pizzeria Giove!"

1787,B-H5VrRI7ouol4Y_ldXT1A,12/8/2022,4 star rating,"As the year is coming to an end we decided to have our team dinner at Sparks since it's close to the office and great walking distance. The food was good, we had mixed reviews on some of the items. The baked clams was okay the team mentioned they have had better. Overall the steak and salmon was good full of flavor. We had two waiters assisting us throughout the evening and they both was very knowledgeable of the menu and was able to assist with items that we selected. The best part of our meal was the dessert. The New York Cheesecake was fresh and light and we added ice cream and that was really good. If you are in mid town check out Sparks Steak House."
1788,B-H5VrRI7ouol4Y_ldXT1A,12/4/2022,4 star rating,"Classic New York Steakhouse, waiters are all dressed in suits, carpeted floors, old paintings on the wall, a coat check. True old New York vibes. Small menu, mix of steak and seafood/fish. I don't remember seeing s chicken option but there was Lamb (for over $90). Appetizers were delicious, buffalo mozzarella, Cesar salad, baked clams. Sides are to share HIGHLY suggest the masked potatoes. I got the Steak Fromage and it was very good, but a tad too salty. If you have room for dessert I suggest the espresso martini and the cheesecake (great combo). Staff were delightful!"
1789,B-H5VrRI7ouol4Y_ldXT1A,10/20/2022,3 star rating,"Atmosphere gets a 10. It reminds me of Ruehl's restaurant in London. Very clubby, slightly European ... lots of gold framed artwork with the lamps above the frame, dark wood, red designed carpet and dim lighting. This place is HUGE and cavernous with two sides. From an atmosphere standpoint, as someone who loves vintage spots, this hits the mark big-time.The staff here are old school Italian. Those of you who have eaten at an Italian restaurant in Italy, that is on the finer dining side know the type of server ... as serious and professional as a German banker ... slightly snooty, as if they are doing you the favor ... and as 'macho' as they are knowledgeable. It is easy to mistake their efficiency for aloofness ... if you quibble over small issues, ask for your table to be moved to a better one, or aren't a regular ... it's likely you'll get the cold shoulder.The couple in front of us was under dressed (him in sockless loafers and a Patagonia 'bubble jacket') and the maitre'd looked them up and down with a sneer. (Rightly deserved ... in a fine dining restaurant, at least put on socks and a blazer!) He was cordial and charming to us in proper dress. Our waitstaff were more the no nonsense type ... air traffic controllers are less serious. We felt they were pushing a bit to have us order more food than we needed. ""Have a salad. You'll like it."" ... ""I'm sure you each should order a side dish. One side won't be enough."", ""Another drink sir? Yours is almost 1/4 done."" ... ""No coffee or dessert? I'll bring a few plates over, just in case."" One great part is our waters never were more than a few sips in before they were refilled throughout the meal.The worst part of our meal was the steak. It was recommended that we order the NY Sirloin, which was stated to be their specialty. A giant hunk of steak, cooked perfectly medium rare (reddish-pink) with a slight salty char on the outside arrived looking like it was supposed to be split by the entire table. I cut into it and it was 50% fat and gristle. There were thick lines of white sinew which ran through the steak and when I cut it, often it sounded like I was sawing through rubber. Half of the steak was inedible. The other half tasted good but had to be cut into small pieces to avoid the long lines of sinew throughout.The spinach salad was fantastic. Real bacon pieces, a tangy dressing and thin slices of mushroom. Probably the best part of the meal was dessert. Don't skip the dessert! The cheesecake was among the best we've had in the city! The Walnut Pecan Pie was one of the best things I've ever eaten, especially when mixed with the cheesecake. This would easily be a two star review, if judged on the steak alone.In summary ... this is not Peter Luger, Delmonicos or Smith & Wollensky. In terms of a great steak, it's hard to beat The Palm. I so wish the steak was cut better because, if it was, I'd come here all the time for the atmosphere. (Well, here and Gallagher's) All the other parts of our meal were great, except for the fatty, gristle-filled chewy steaks. A shame because the flavor was decent. Be warned ..."
1790,B-H5VrRI7ouol4Y_ldXT1A,3/3/2022,5 star rating,"Update to my last review!!We loved this classic, old-school place so much after coming for my birthday in June that we treated my boyfriend's parents here last Sunday evening. I think we may have loved it even more this time!Amongst the four of us, we ordered the Shrimp Cocktail, Fresh Bufala Mozzarella with sliced Tomato, Scottish Smoked Salmon, Oysters on the Half Shell, 2 Prime Sirloin Steaks, Steak Fromage, Prime Sirloin Steak (""fancy"", with added mushrooms and peppers, for Dad), Creamed Spinach, Mushroom Caps, Baked Potato, Steamed Spinach, and a bottle of Sirah for my love and me. Again, everything was absolutely perfect. Juan was our server and he was delightful! I think Sparks might be my favorite place now. I can see why they're so famous (apart from the mob stuff haha) and have been such an important NYC fixture for so long."
1791,B-H5VrRI7ouol4Y_ldXT1A,3/21/2023,5 star rating,"IMHO, Sparks is the absolute holy grail of steakhouses in NYC, with the best & freshest cuts of meat (which melt in your mouth like butter), the best side dishes, and the best wine cellar/collection, and the coolest staff. Not the cheapest, but if you are going to go swimming, you might as well get wet! I would take this over any steakhouse in NY (or anywhere else for that matter) without even thinking twice or blinking an eye. This is as serious as it gets! Must be tasted to be believed. A+++++ (By the way, I've had them all, and still, I take Sparks, and don't look back)."
1792,B-H5VrRI7ouol4Y_ldXT1A,3/19/2022,4 star rating,"Though I was born and raised here, I feel I have many blind spots when it comes to legendary restaurants in NYC; I've been to some, but there are many I am yet to try. One that I can now cross off my list is Sparks Steak House, since an educational dinner found me here the other night. I like attending these because it gives me a chance to learn something new and usually try out a restaurant that's new to me. That being said, I was looking forward to seeing what Sparks had to offer. Sparks is unassuming from the outside, looking like a typical spot on a typical Midtown block. Inside is a different story - you're almost taken back in time with the decor and aesthetics. It has a really old school feel - lots of classic wood accents with a red color scheme. It was also quite large inside, atypical of a Manhattan restaurant. We were seated in a private room in the basement - which again to my surprise was very spacious. I couldn't stop looking around at all the details and fixtures - very vintage but kept very well. As with most educational dinners I go to, we had a prix-fixe menu with choices of apps and entrees. I decided to start with the mozzarella, which came as two large semi-rounds and sat on top of tomato with a side of basil (a take on caprese salad). The cheese was good, and it came with sides of oil and balsamic which really brought it all together. We had a number of dishes to choose for our main, and since I was at a steakhouse I went with beef - specifically the filet mignon. It was honestly the biggest filet mignon I have ever seen - close to twice the size of others I have had. It was very good, I can tell they use high-quality meat. For sides we had sauteed spinach and hash-browned potatoes which were simple but good, and a good pairing with the meaty filet. For dessert we had NY style cheesecake which was a good finisher.Service was good, they were on top of everything and all the food came out at a good pace. Overall, I was impressed with Sparks - the quality of the meat, the aesthetics, the mob hit, and the history all make this a destination eatery in NYC. I would definitely return to explore more of their menu."
1793,B-H5VrRI7ouol4Y_ldXT1A,3/23/2022,2 star rating,"It's definitely just not good, and I don't know what the positive ratings are saying here. This is a place running on reputational fumes and tourists who want to see where John Gotti ordered a hit (and who hope to eat alongside the mob, but that ended in the 1990s). The room is dark and cavernous, like entering a mausoleum. We had the shrimp cocktail and expected, if not a seafood tower, at least more than 4 shrimps. P2P (price to portions ratio) is just not good. I had the signature prime sirloin, and it came overly charred, which undercut the flavor. (Charcoal tends to do that.) The seasoning is also too light.In all, a disappointment. In a city with Keens, Smith and Wolensky's, and Delmonico's, why settle?"

I ordered drunken noodles with shrimp and my husband got drunken noodles with chicken. We also got the appetizer platter. The food came quickly, but when we opened the small bag we were taken aback. The portion was not a regular size for drunken noodles and it tasted like some of the ingredients were quite stale. There was some kind of stuff in the shrimp that had a very weird texture. I'd never had drunken noodles like this before and like I said we get this dish from MANY Thai restaurants. The apps were extremely dry and the chicken satay was definitely from another day. We couldn't even finish the food and enjoy dinner. It was bad. I know a lot of things have changed because of COVID-19, but I can never order from Amina Thai again."

My friends and i came in a party of 4 we were seated and ordered. This Thai is a little different from other places I've been but honestly still really good. I love good deals and this was great. The only thing i would comment on is the lack of service, there was only one person serving the entire restaurant which was a little difficult to deal with when on a time crunch. I had to physically go up and wait at the register in order to pay the check. Otherwise though, i had a perfect experience."

Hands down gives you an Authentic taste of Thailand Green Curry ...Thailand Iced Tea was alright, could have been better. Maybe less ice, next time I will definitely try lychee Ice Tea.Drunken Noodles with chicken was good but not great.The Service was Excellent, the chef came to ask us how we liked the food. She was really nice :) We love it that it's a family owned business and they are able to provide you with a Taste of Thailand :)We are glad we went and looking fwd to enjoying other dishes."

Parking in this area is usually a mess but it was surprisingly easy to find. Upon arrival, there was only a party of 2 and the server seated us at a table. About 15 mins in she came back and took our orders. A few minutes later, she brought our drinks then our food. I got the basil fried rice with shrimp and asked for it to be spicy. My fried got the veggie duck with veggies and white rice. The basil fried rice was bland in comparison to other thai food i've had. I'm A HUGE FAN OF THAI. I've tried countless restaurants so my opinion might be bias. If you're new to the whole thai experience, this dish would be a ""wow, so good"" for you. In my opinion, it lacked flavor... and it was not spicy, at all!My friend's veggie duck was also bland. There was nothing special about it but it did come with lots of sweet peppers and onions. If you're just getting lunch or something basic, go for it. Otherwise, it's a pass for me. Service was slow; food was tasteless (in comparison to other places i've tried)."

They have a variety of options (although their lunch menu is a bit limited). We ordered the beef drunken noodles (10/10!!) and the red pepper fried rice with chicken. It wasn't as flavorful, will be ordering a different kind next time. Highly recommend, prices are more than fair (about $10/entree and the portions are generous), cute setting, great experience!Update: this place is ALWAYS a winner. The food always comes fast and the staff is so courteous and nice. And the food ALWAYS tastes great. My favorite Thai restaurant!!"

The cashier was very friendly and accommodating. Watching them make the cake through the glass window was a nice experience since it is a small and narrow bakery.The matcha mousse cake topped with mochi pieces was heavenly. The matcha taste is strong and earthy, with no bitterness even with the powder on top. There's a milk or cream mousse in the middle that is silky and adds sweetness to the taste of the matcha. On the bottom, there's a dark, crumbly crust which added texture to the smooth mousse.

It was pouring outside and the streets were quite literally inundated, so we took refuge in Takahachi Bakery, or should I say paradise. The pastries in their case are exactly my vibe and I knew I had to get the Matcha Crepe with Red Bean Cream. It's a no brainer as I adore crepes, matcha, red bean, and especially - fluffy whipped cream! The preparation is adorable - love how they wrap it in a ""newspaper."" And words can not express how thoroughly I enjoyed the dessert! The crepe is so dainty and thin, and the matcha powder more than comes through. They are not skimping on the ground matcha by any means, and they use a high quality matcha powder at that. The red bean cream inside is thick and barely sweet, just how I like it. The Cappuccino was well-made with a spot-on ratio of ethereal milk foam to bittersweet espresso. I was delighted by the strong espresso shots in there. The Chocolate Mousse Cake and Peanut Soba Noodles were also delicious! The former is incredibly decadent - epic with coffee, I might add. I particularly loved the strong buckwheat flavor of the soba noodles. I would love to come back for the sandwiches; I'm a huge fan of the fluffy Japanese milk bread they are using.The service is polite and this isn't a big cafe but there is still quite a bit of seating available.

The matcha latte had a strong matcha flavor. There wasn't any sugar added. Not sure if there was sugar that you can add in after as I left as soon as I got the order.The matcha crepe had really soft creme inside. However, the filling was too sweet. The crepe itself was thin and coated heavily in matcha powder which was great. I ended up saving the beef curry pan for the next day. Even after being left in the fridge overnight and microwaved the next day, it was so good. The curry flavor was prominent, and there was a good amount of filling. The outside was coated in curry powder and other seasonings. I can't imagine how good it would taste if it was fresh. The prices aren't bad at all for the portion. I'll definitely be back to try other items."

I liked the texture of the bread and the doughiness of the batter.

The cashier was very friendly and accommodating. Watching them make the cake through the glass window was a nice experience since it is a small and narrow bakery.The matcha mousse cake topped with mochi pieces was heavenly. The matcha taste is strong and earthy, with no bitterness even with the powder on top. There's a milk or cream mousse in the middle that is silky and adds sweetness to the taste of the matcha. On the bottom, there's a dark, crumbly crust which added texture to the smooth mousse. It looks like it might be heavy since it is mousse but it's very very light and sweet.I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to try Japanese bread and a few pastries !"

And words can not express how thoroughly I enjoyed the dessert! The crepe is so dainty and thin, and the matcha powder more than comes through. They are not skimping on the ground matcha by any means, and they use a high quality matcha powder at that. The red bean cream inside is thick and barely sweet, just how I like it.

We were a party of 15+ people and the establishment had combined the tables so we can all seat together. The place had a very cool rustic, modern and unique theme which we all found very cool and intriguing. The ambiance was very mellow with dimmed lighting which made the environment perfect for an evening dinner celebration. Our service was great,  we had a decent amount of selections from the prefix menu. I ordered the Lollipop Chicken Wings as an appetizer, which were delicious, very well cooked, tender but still crunchy. For the Entree, I ordered the Lobster Medallion & Shrimp. The dish came with a fair amount of shrimp, however the Lobster was a bit small and I would've enjoyed a bigger portion. Nonetheless, both the shrimp and lobster were very rich in taste. And as an appetizer I ordered a Crème Brûlée that was absolutely delicious. The Crème Brûlée was creamy, sweet and slightly tangy with a smoky flavor from the slight burnt of caramel sugar.I was a little bit disappointed that we were not able to order any cocktail drinks from the bar. But overall it was a great experience, and would recommend you to visit this place, for a nice night out with friends or family."

The dim lighting and romantic atmosphere make it perfect for a low-key date night to have a few cocktails and share some small plates. Unfortunately, this restaurant is not a destination for a food experience. While the menu items seem ""high-end"" on paper, the flavor or quality just isn't there - it's lacking substance and will leave you feeling unsatisfied if you come with an appetite. I would recommend having the right expectations before visiting, and enjoy it more as a lounge instead."

I came by with two of my girlfriends on a Friday night and we had a great time. For drinks, I got the passion fruit margarita and my friend got the frozen pina colada, both of us really enjoyed it. FYI they offer mocktails if you're not feeling an alcoholic drink! We shared two appetizers and two entrees for the table and were all rubbing our bellies at the end of the meal. The popcorn chicken and the fries were crispy and great for sharing. The entrees at first glance seemed a bit pricey but were bigger portioned than I expected. The seafood pasta was savory and creamy and the brisket fell apart super easily. Overall, a solid meal and vibey restaurant to finish anyone's long work week!

The short rib was beautifully plated and the oysters looked incredibly fresh. I took my first bite of the short rib and was blown away by the rich, flavorful meat. The bone marrow added an extra layer of richness and depth that was absolutely delicious. The plump oysters were also a highlight and bursting with flavor. They were briny and tasted of the ocean. The combination of the short rib and oysters was truly delightful.The crab and spinach dip was delightful. I also enjoyed the creamy burrata with the prosciutto.However, I also ordered the Tomahawk Steak, and unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to expectations. Parts of the steak were sinewy and some were buttery and delicious.I loved the short ribs and oysters."

It has a sweet flavor and smooth texture, as well as a creaminess that lingers after you eat it. 10 out of 10.

The bar is in front and tables are in the back. I came for dinner. I ordered happy hour oysters (half off) and $5 sangria. For dinner we ordered the braised short rib with bone marrow, crab cakes and   tavern burger with truffle fries. The crab cakes were okay, but they were super tiny, literally size of a silver dollar; an order came with two pieces. The braised short ribs were so good, but the truffle mash potatoes that came with the dish was AMAZING. We ended up ordering more truffle mash. Service was nice and attentive, but it was also a slow week night. I brought my daughter and she liked the decor. She was intrigued by the hanging deer. I will definitely come back again to try the other stuff from the menu."

I ordered via Ubereats as it was the highest rated Indian restaurant in my vicinity and I have no idea why it received a 4.9 but I can tell you right now something does not add up with that rating at all. My order of tandoori shrimp apparently came with no rice? Honestly it came with just shrimp and that was $18.99! I ordered a samosa that was never put in the bag. To add insult to injury there was a huge print out of my order which clearly shows what I asked for. It was stapled to the bag my food came in which means they did not double check the correctness of my order. In other words their customer service skills will need serious improving. Normally I read reviews of establishments before making my final decision to conduct business with them; I sincerely regret not doing so because it's a trend with this restaurant and their carry out services. Now as for the taste of their food, this is a serious hard no for me. I asked for my tandoori shrimp to have a medium spice level and it was mild. I've been to a few Indian restaurants and this just doesn't compare. Tandoori Hut has a long way to go."

On the 2nd call, the guy says ""here's the driver's number. Call him"". Seriously??!! HOW IS THAT MY JOB?! STRIKE 2 & 3!!Ok, I call the driver. I hear 2 different guys speaking into the phone giving me two different delivery times. One guy is saying less than 10 minutes, another one is saying 10-15.

My roommate and I placed an order via Grub hub at 9PM. Shortly after I received a call and was told they were out of chicken curry (my fav) and asked if they could substitute with Chicken Marsala. I had no problem with this. Food was supposed to be delivered at 10 PM. I called the restaurant to enquire and was informed that the food was ready, however the driver was not. We waiting another 20 mins and called the Restaurant again and was brushed off and told to call the driver. So we did. The driver said it would be 10-15 more minutes. Another 20 minutes went by and I called Grubhub to complain, and was told because the restaurant was closed nothing could be done. So I called the driver back and asked him where he was and he said 10 mins. When I said,"" yea, but that's what you said 20 mins ago."" He just replied with "" give me 10 mins ""Our food arrived at 11PM, hot and steamy. There's no way someone drove around for an hour and the food was still hot. Roommate and I dig in. Food is delicious as always. Here's where it gets interesting.You see as I'm packing up my leftovers I'm continuing to nibble on the Marsala and Naan. One scoop with my spoon, two scoops with my spoon, on the third one I felt something heavy latch onto the spoon! I immediately called to my roommates attention who to pics while I shook the food off. It seems to be a metal hanging something or other, for a utensil. Whatever it is, it was in my food, the food that was over an hour late, that wasn't even the dish I had ordered.

Literally I saw her take the order right before I walked in, I guess this place really doesn't wanna make money during the pandemic. How much longer will making one more cup of tea going to take? This store needs to do better training their employees, even if they are closing I should not be getting an attitude from them."

I havent had my coffee, so dropped by this place since it was the closest place to get a drink. what i needed was an iced coffee but then realized why would i get an iced coffee from a place like this. if i wanted iced coffee, i couldve went to a chinese bakery like tai pan or fay da. A friend and I went in. I had no idea what i wanted, so i looked at the popular choices and the one that came to me was the lemon yogurt. Ordered a large with 50% sugar and regular ice. Its cool that you can choose your level of sweetness and ice amount. I cant see anyone getting lots of ice, since you are paying the same amount. Lemon yogurt was pretty good although next time I would prob reduce the level of sweetness. Im typically a sweet type of person, but 50% to me was too sweet. It also came with lemon rind on the bottom of the drink. It was quite refreshing. I love fresh lemonade so the yogurt gave it as extra kick to it. id get it again for sure."

Other places I found have weak tea base and/or is way too sweet when ordered the same way. I can't speak for other varieties on their menu as this is my go to drink."

I've tried the oolong tea, oolong milk tea, earl gray latte (my favorite- it has a sweet fruity taste), and the brown sugar milk tea. It's very clean, and while small, service is fast. The milk tea is creamy and delicious, while the boba is some of the best I've ever had. Would highly recommend if you're looking for the standard types of milk tea and bubbles."

To start, the woman that worked there (I believe was the owner) was so friendly and kind. She joked with us on how to pronounce things we hadn't heard of, made sure we were comfortable and good to go, and apologized more than once when our food took a little longer. They were super busy for a Tuesday after lunch, and the wait still wasn't unbearable. The food was amazing! Best gyro I've had. We ordered the ""plates"". Each one comes with a big Greek salad and a side. The portions were huge and the taste even bigger! It was too much to eat in one sitting, and they even made fresh pita for our to go boxes. It's definitely a family owned place. Smaller, but clean and well maintained. Everyone was great. Will definitely be making this a part of my regular East Elmhurst spots!"

Gyro sandwiches are also pretty decent. I have been going there since the early 2000's. As of late, I have noticed a decline in quality of their products. First, it was the tzatziki sauce. It was awesome and the recipe has most definitely changed.  It is still decent, but it looks and feels a lot more processed and less home made. This last time, the side salads now lack that spicy pepper. Last time I went they told me while picking up my food that their CC machine ""was down""... this time... ""we don't really take CC"" All in all... it's a decent, convenient for me, neighborhood Greek take out spot (I wouldn't go outta my way to go there... specially now that they don't take CC)"

I don't think I have seen a messier Chipotle than this one on 14 St. Now, I don't frequent Chipotle often but the ones that I have eaten in are A LOT cleaner. By a landslide. It's gross how disorganized this establishment was on Tuesday. I get that the location is busy and workers are moving quickly to pump orders out, but there are no excuses for food that didn't make the bowl/burrito/taco to be sprawled out on the counter. It looks sloppy and unsanitary. Get a towel and keep it neat FGS. Onto the food. I ordered the chicken/ rice bowl with all the works. The rice was soft and clumped together. Don't serve it. It's disrespectful. I ate it because - money. Who has 15 bucks to throw down the drain?! Not I. I will say the workers were generous and did not skimp at all. Perhaps, it was to get rid of that clumped rice. The green hot sauce they have on the side had a sour taste. Spoiled? IDK but yuck! I am not sure if this is a common occurrence at this location but I won't be back to find out."

They don't seem to care enough about cleansliness as they do security, so while a security guard walks around the restaurant, there is no one on the floor, wiping down tables (and seats for that matter). Dropped food runs rampant throughout and as this location sports mostly communal tables, I hunkered down, ate real quick and was sure to high-tail it out of there. Placing my order was only okay. Staff didn't seem to ask what I wanted and they didnt even ask me if I wanted guac, which is as I've come to know a big selling point for the chain. The staff seemed very apathetic to what they were doing, not greeting or even making eye contact. It's a very isolating experience. I guess the one thing I take away from this experience is that I didn't get sick, so that was at least... something good?"

Coming back home, the bag was leaking. Turns out it was my salad's fault. I had to carefully open it and not make a mess by putting the foil lid underneath. There was so much juice that wasn't drained from the beans I guess. And all my lettuce turned soggy into mush. NO BUENO!Oh wells!

I went to dos toros first and they had no seating...I went right back to chipotle and ordered a chicken burrito bowl, with the tortilla on the side. A side of chips and guac and the sweet cashier even gave me a sample of the queso dip to try. I never tried the queso and was super curious. She thought the queso tasted like potatoes when I asked her opinion. I tried it and weirdly it did lol. The guac and chips came thru, I always put a bunch of the green sauce in my guac to give it more seasoning and more a kick. The green sauce makes everythingggg taste way better. I enjoyed my meal and the service. I was super happy they have alot of seating and wifi. So happy with my final decision."

I'm a Chipotle fan but it had been a while since I've dined at any because of a strict diet I've been following. That's why I was so disappointed when I stopped at this location to get a taste of what I have been missing for a while and the service was lackluster. First, the facility just didn't appear clean. Every other location I've visited has always been pristine but on this particular night there was table scraps all over various seating/eating areas and looked like it hadn't been wiped down for hours. The staff was friendly but I find that they were moving very slow and it wasn't packed; so I was confused as to why. Also, the drink dispenser was not working properly and they were out of about 4 flavors. My burrito wasn't wrapped properly either BUT now I'm just nitpicking. lol"

The place looked busy so that added to my surprise and disbelief. Even though I work farther away it's reassuring to know that the service was great and I felt welcomed.

1906,wE60iyOguc42S7MrTSgVIQ,12/31/2022,5 star rating,"Came here a week before the holidays with the fam for brunch. Hudson Yards mall was bustling and this restaurant was popping with many patrons. I got this reservation about 2 weeks in advance. There is a bar located in the middle of the restaurant and seats along the perimeter (lounge). They also have a room that looks like it could be used for a large party private dinning. We were seated in the best seats in the house: right at the window with a marvelous view of the Vessel. Our waiter was attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. They have an a La carte menu to pick from OR a prix fixe menu of 2 courses. Not all the a La carte is featured in the prix fixe. Drinks:Mimosa- standard drink, no twist.Shimmering Sunrise- refreshing citrus pick me up!Food:Smashed Avocado- this baby is simple yet complex. The smashed avocado is not exactly guacamole. It's tasty and served with sweet potato chips. DELICIOUS. It seems the majority of the restaurant got the memo: I swear every table had this to eat.Burrata: was creamy and served with a coca nib crumble- which was more so salty savory. Interesting combo, but was a delightful crunchy edition to my mouth. It is served with bread, but I thought the sweet potato chips held up to it pretty well.Prawn Cocktail: tasty prawns. My party and I did not like the cocktail sauce. There was something in it that left a bitter aftertaste, unlike any other cocktail sauce I had ( I do not think it had anything to do with the horseradish ratio). Oysters: super tasty. Can't go wrong with ordering this.Burger: I don't eat burgers that much, so I am very picky about where I enjoy them. This burger held up to my standards. I ordered mine medium with a side salad. My other party member had it well with fries. Ugh. Mine was so juicy. A marriage is flavors in my mouth. I cut it in half to eat only half to save room for dessert, but I just had to devour it it all. I tastes the fries... not the top of my list- can skip if you want to save the calories for something more special.Chicken and waffles: fried chicken smothered with a truffle sauce on top. Standard waffles. If you like truffles, this is a delightful take on a staple brunch dish. Chicken fried steak: not your traditional chicken fried steak. Batter is lighter. I did not taste this. My party member who likes traditional dishes was not a fan AT ALL. He wished he had ordered the burger. The restaurant was so sweet, they offered to bring another dish. We were not charged for the chicken fried steak. Sticky Toffee cake: OMG. I stuffed this in my belly.it was so good. Salty sweet sauce, cake texture. I don't regret this. Worth all the calories. It's served with an orange ice cream. I preferred to eat it with the trio of ice creams offered separately. If you are a fan of orange, then have at it! Sorbets/ Ice cream: all very good. I will be back for DINNER! 5"

If u didn't know, your surroundings should tell you, you're going to pay a small overhead for the beauty of prime real estate in NYC- so u cannot compare QY to some spot in lower manhattan or outer boroughs. Glad we cleared that outta the way.Get the $9 bread. In fact get 2. It's literally the best gluteny crispy hint of sourdough loaf you can find outside of Europe. Cannot rave about this enough.Get the burger- really excellent w crisp hard bacon sweet jam. Jus excellent- comes w crispy fries even if they look a bit pale. It's good.The halibut was beautiful and delish. Yes pricey. I might try another entree, or get 2 burgers next time or 1 burger and 3 loaves of bread lol. But I'm not hating. Brussels are requisite.Their cocktails are especially good and costly esp if you tailor them. Lastly, it's the most wonderful time of the year. Lucky if u can go here all the time but once in a while for a celebration is worthy. Side note- our 1 point of contention... perhaps QY can tighten their staff albeit our server was really accommodating. The host (not hostess) left much to be desired. For a top notched looking place like this, you want your crew to match your ship. Just saying. Happy holidays it's all love."

I do wish they gave us more bread to go with the cheese since there was 3 of us and 4 pieces of bread. We ordered another round of drinks and by this point we realized we had been sitting and waiting for over an hour on our food. The waiter must have realized we realized and cameOver to apologize. We were promised our food and sure enough another 15 mins went by. When the food did come out the manager came to apologize and they deducted the food from our bill. We were happily surprised. This is definitely a once in a lifetime restaurant for the views and that's if you get lucky enough to sit by the window. The food is good but not amazing. But the service is outstanding!
1909,wE60iyOguc42S7MrTSgVIQ,4/5/2023,4 star rating,"Came here mostly for the view and ambiance. Food is decent but slightly overpriced. My mom got the lunch prefix and it wasn't worth the price at all. She got the burrata as her appetizer which was super tiny. Her salad was just baby leaves with no toppings and barely any dressing. The salmon that she added to the salad was delicious tho. It wasn't fishy and had a nice crispy crust. It was also a decent size unlike the tiny portion of chicken that they put on my salad. I got the purple lady drink. Highly recommend it! Not only it looks cool but it taste delicious. For my entree I got the Truffle Caesar Salad with chicken which was delicious but the chicken portion was tiny. Highly recommend getting the Truffle Caesar salad but add salmon to it. Service was very attentive. Overall, not a bad spot to try if you are in Hudson Yard if you are looking to take some cute photos."

After I sat, it took a little bit of time to get our orders in. I got the olive oil poached halibut. The waiter also asked if we wanted bread which we said yes. To me, a proper dinner spot always comes with bread and butter. I also particularly judge the quality of the restaurant with a heavy skew to its bread quality!When we got the main dishes, the bread still hadn't arrived and by this point it was probably 20-30 minutes since we first ordered.My halibut was great, really interesting design and shaped in a cylinder - quite avant garde. I think the plating did a good job. But, the bread still hadn't arrived yet.We had requested again the bread.We were trying to eat the entree as slowly as possible but we gave up at some point and finished our entree. The staff were fast to come to take away our plates of entree we finished.About five minutes after that the bread service finally came...The one dish I did have the quality was good so props to the chefs. To me this is a big service mishap though, I can't say I'd been to a restaurant yet where the bread service was give after the entrees were finished."

The hostess desk is uninterested in seating you, and they were so busy talking to each other and looking at their phones. I was with a large party (approx 10 ppl). We were seated per our reservation time, which was 130, and it was all downhill from there.  For starters, I understand that large parties can take a while to serve but I'd like to say that the restaurant was not that busy.  Our drinks took over 20 mins to come out, and then too a few orders were missing.  We ordered a few apps, and again no one came to take our food orders for over 25 mins after we were done with appetizers. Once we all did get a chance to order, it was another 25 mins before our server came back to say they ran out of chicken and waffles!  Of our party of ten, I want to say at least 7 ppl ordered the chicken waffles. . Our server was nice but maybe he was stretched a little thin Because it did seem he had a lot of tables and was one of the only people on the floor taking orders and such.  I hate being loud or obnoxious, I don't like being rude to servers since I know they have a difficult job, but it would've been nice for someone to help him out especially since where we were seated we couldn't really get anyone's attention, so if someone passed by we would try to ask for things such as utensils, sauces, more drinks, etc.  The food, for what it cost, was not worth it (my burger was ok and the chicken fried steak was kinda bland and lacking seasoning despite the chili crisp). The Mac and cheese with oxtail was very good, and the Brussels sprouts which was listed as a side. All in all I won't be returning but hoping this was just a bad day for this establishment. I'd like to think it would be better if we ever went back."
1914,wE60iyOguc42S7MrTSgVIQ,1/26/2023,3 star rating,The food was pretty mid. The deserts were just okay. The drinks were really good and strong. I can see myself coming back here for the drinks. The wait time in the food was really high even though the place wasn't that full. The ambiance was really good too! Come for the drinks and the vibes but eat somewhere else. :)

For dinner we got the ribeye and the squid ink pasta. Both dishes were really good. I was surprised with how much seafood was in the linguine. The ribeye was also very tender."
1916,ihd2cISx6muy6bKVPhA4cg,3/12/2022,4 star rating,"Since I had not had ramen in quite some time, I knew that if I came here and had a bowl, that my stomach would be able to handle it. Needless to say, that theory was proven correct.Starting with the Shrimp Shumai, six beautifully wrapped shrimp sitting in a tangy sauce, these tasted fresh and could easily be one of those things you could eat 100 of and still feel good. The price of these are high, so unless I am with a large party, I will likely avoid getting this again. It is an unnecessary expense that only makes your stomach bigger and your wallet thinner.As for my ramen choice, I went with the Tonkotsu Ramen with extra noodle (always get extra noodle if you are given the option). The ramen comes out fast, and looks attractive. In general, ramen is a visually appealing dish, but this one looked splendid. It also is benefitted by the fact that Tonkotsu Ramen is known for its milky white broth due to the pork bones breaking down in the water for a significant amount of time; there is no milk in this broth at all. Speaking of pork, the pork chashu is beautifully cooked and not too dense, and the amount is perfect. The noodles are perfect, and they definitely taste fresh, in a milled out sort of way. Getting the extra noodles is also the right move because it is like getting two ramen bowls for the price of one; you get lots of noodles to keep your strength going - if you still have it.If you still some reserves in the tank, make your way over to their sister sushi restaurant, Zest Sushi, only about a 10 minute walk from this restaurant. My only complaint is the hours. They are open from noon until 4, then close for a half hour and reopen for dinner at 4:30. They then stay open until 10 or 11. That is not reflected anywhere on their website or here on Yelp, so when I came at 4 and found they were closed, it was upsetting to be turned away. Be current on your hours please.That minor blip aside, I am happy with the food I got here and will return to try another bowl."

From the happy hour, We got 2 $5 plum wines, $5 purple fries, $1 oysters, and $5 takoyaki. Then, we each got $15 tonkotsu ramen. Later, because the waitress had us move tables to allow for another group to sit, they gave us 2 more free glasses of wine, which were stronger than I expected. Everything was really tasty -- I especially liked how everything in the happy hour was so cheap and plentiful! I would 100% come back and take advantage of the happy hour menu and get more oysters!! The ramen soup was so delicious and the meat was very soft and juicy! The wine was also very tasty."

This one was decent but the soup base had hints of seafood more than rich bone flavor (maybe it was the fake crab swirl thingy that tricked my brain). There wasn't really a lot of spice to it but the overall broth was creamy and buttery (and not too salty). The egg and chasu in it were delicious. There was construction in front of the shop but it was too nice of a day NOT to sit at table closest to the sidewalk (besides it added some nice flare to the outside pic).We were uneasy by their health scores but we didn't see anything terrible in the front of the house, and restroom is one of the cleanest we've used in the city."

After reading the raving reviews here, I expected a tasteful experience especially since I was craving ramen and this spot happened to be in Chinatown. We had the plum wine, fried oyster, and tonkotsu ramen. To be quite frank, none of the items impressed us. The wine is not their issue but beware that the plum wine taste like cough syrup. Do adults drink this all the time ? Hmm definitely an acquired taste. The fried oyster was quite decent but huh why was there only three pieces when I saw the five in the other Yelp pictures. Lastly, the tonkotsu ramen was quite an experience. The ramen was very lukewarm - almost to the point that it was cold. Nothing about it was impressive and honey you are not getting a second try again ok."

We didn't have high expectations because there were hardly any people inside but we were craving ramen so bad after being disappointed. Inside it was small and quaint. A dark, moody vibe with candles at every table. It was freezing out so we were really looking forward to a nice, warm bowl of ramen. We ordered the spicy tonkotsu ramen. Broth was actually pretty spicy - hit me right in the back of my throat. But I just couldn't stop drinking it. I loved the cha siu that came with it. Nice fatty and juicy pieces that had such a great char to it. The char mixed with the broth and created a nice, rich flavor. I was also enjoyed the soft boiled egg, it was marinated very nicely. It was a perfect bowl of ramen and the best part about it was that it came super fast! We waited maybe 10-15 minutes and it appeared right in front of us!Price was more than fair and after peeking at the menu, it looks like they have a pretty good happy hour too. I definitely have to come back for the oysters! So happy to find a delicious ramen place that makes my wallet happy as well!"

I ordered from El Toro because we order from there frequently during the week and honestly their tacos are Bomb. We ordered a variety of tacos, rice and beans, chips salsa and guacamole. One of my employees started eating her rice and beans, a few mins later she screamed and spit out a rock. There was a black rock in her black beans. Naturally no one else wanted to eat their food in fear of something foreign being in their food as well. The order was delivered at 5 o'clock on the dot... we didn't get to the food until 5:45 which was 45 mins after EL Toro closes on a Saturday. They're not open on Sunday, so I called first thing this afternoon to complain. I told my story to the manager, and his response was ""you're not the first person to tell me this, it happens sometimes"".... I couldn't believe it! Apparently other people have complained about the rock in the rice and beans yet they still serve it. My employee could've broken a tooth! A waste of $150 dollars! Never again!"

I'm in and off they go.As I'm waiting they hand me a fried shrimp to try and its awesome. If you like shrimp parm sandwiches, you are probably missing out not going here. To me, that sounds disgusting. So sandwich is made pretty quick, I go l/t/o and ask for oil and vinegar. That's where my major complaint comes in. My sandwich took a bath in balsamic vinegar. As in, when I went to eat it 10 minutes later the bread had gone soft and wet from so much balsamic. The meat was still tasty, and it was a solid sandwich, but holy crap. Sandwich, bag of chips and 2 cans of soda ran me $13.50... pretty good deal there."

It is right next to Port Richmond HS, the street it is on is narrow but there is a parking lot (huge PLUS). Its a DELI and is SUPER small so don't expect to stay and eat unless its a nice day weather wise - there are some small patio tables along the side of the building in the parking lot.  This place definitely saves me a trip to Brooklyn for a great hero sandwich!"

Both espresso drinks were good. Smooth finish and right balance between espresso and milk; only nit is that the top of each drink had a micro foam which I haven't seen before on either drinks at cafes. Would have expected that velvety finish. Food: went light and got the spinach cheese pastry. I thought it was really good and a nice pairing with the Cortado. Nice touch by the cafe to warm it up as it came out crispy... only nit it was that it was a bit on the oily (or greasy) side. Just one other comment - our table had the previous patrons plate and cup on the table when we sat down. They removed them when they brought our food and drinks out.

So after my errands, I looked for a place nearby for a bite to eat. So I ended up at this cafe. My first thoughts were that it was cute and quaint (hence living up to its name). There was 1 person in the cafe enjoying a crepe while there were 2 people outside talking with what I assume was coffee. As you might tell by one of the photos, this is a cafe that does not allow computers in use. While I don't know if it is for outside too but it makes sense due to its small space to keep people coming for space. Because I had opted for an indoor visit, they had asked for my id and my vaccine card. I didn't know it was such a crepe heavy place until I arrived. I wasn't mad at it because I have not had a crepe in a while. I opted for sweet crepe through a banana Nutella crepe and added an orange juice mimosa. The mimosa wasn't too orange juice heavy but balanced enough for an afternoon treat. The crepe was sweet as promised with enough banana and Nutella to make it worth it. I had a nice time. The bathroom was perfectly clean. Though I can't come here for work (because laptop), I could come here for a quick bite by myself or with a friend or date. I do regret not getting a savory crepe so maybe I will next time."

They offered to seat me immediately so that I could wait for my friend without being in the rain. I only ever had filipino food once, but I only had the chicken adobo, and I wanted to try something different so I got the goat curry. It wasn't too spicy and had a lot of flavor. It also came with rice pancakes (i think), and some chutney to balance out the spiciness. Great dish! The dumplings were also pretty good. For dessert I had a tokoy, and it was my first time trying it. I liked the taste and texture of the rice pancake but the ice cream was not agreeable with me in terms of taste. It was a little tart and a little sour, reminded me of a pickled plum. I also bought the lechon as a treat to take back to my family and it took us three days to finish, so if you order in the restaurant, I would recommend sharing it with three people, because it gets really rich and filling."
1967,1fDtQij01Mk92ZTGn6WHjg,9/6/2020,4 star rating,Really enjoyed their veggie bibimbap. The purple rice adds a great touch as opposed to the usual white rice. Unique veggies like lotus root and king oyster mushrooms. One of my favorite bibimbaps (probably because it was doused with sesame oil but I love sesame oil). Their kimchi is also vegan and really yummy! I know this is a Filipino focused restaurant but I only tried their vegan options which was the bibimbap. The veggie japchae can be made vegan but has honey unless you let them know. Service was good!Regarding covid they have outdoor seating. The only downside was there were flies in the backyard seating :/ it is the outdoors but wish they controlled that better.

My friend who is Filipino recommended it, went for dinner and was not disappointed.The beet dumplings were surprisingly earthy and delicious. The lumpia is also a must try.The lechón was super crispy and the chicken Adobo tasted amazing.For dessert we had the champorrado, which is this heavenly dark chocolate rice pudding topped with coffee ice cream. The halo halo was fine, it needed more toppings but the Ube ice cream tasted homemade and fresh. The only let down was the Buko pie, the coconut pie was overly sweet and the crust was soggy. Overall awesome food, chill ambiance, would go back if it wasn't so far away."

This is the first time back dining here after COVID. And unfortunately, it's hit and miss. I thought the Korean pancake was too thick and doughy, not at all like the Korean pancakes in K-town, which is thin, crusty on the outside but chewy in the inside, and full of seafood every bite. PY's Korean pancake had very few shrimps, and too thick in my opinion. The Sisig was bland, not enough salt, not enough taste. But the Torcino was great. We gobbled it down. The Curry goat taste good, but I feel the meat was not fresh off the butcher's block, but might have been cooked a while ago. The Kilimansi drink was ok. I've had it before, every time I came here. This time I felt it was a bit watered down. Inflation, perhaps."

The food was way better than I expected( edamame, ribs, salmon, some strange veggie dish ). One server doing everything - taking your order making drinks and basically everything else under the sun. But in this day and age somewhat normal. So service was spotty."

I usually stop in for an appetizer & a Kalamansi Soju while I wait for my boys to-go order. This place is chronically understaffed. It you gauged your experience on service alone, I beg you to look around & notice that 2 people are responsible for all the tables. They are remarkably good given the challenges handed to them by whomever staffs this place. The food is consistently remarkably great. Please go, be patient with the servers. Enjoy the great food."

The owner/chef, Romy Dorotan, was very warm, hospitable, and genuinely cares about the quality of food he delivers to his guests. All of the food was excellent - from the sisig, to the lechon kawali, to the tempura-like ukoy - it was all very delicious and brought back memories of eating a good home cooked meal from our relatives back home. He was kind enough to sit with us and share a little background about his story and how he ended up in NY, and you can tell he is passionate about what he does. Highly recommend!"
1973,1fDtQij01Mk92ZTGn6WHjg,1/3/2019,3 star rating,"I'm Filipino, so I feel obligated to try all Filipino restaurants.  Came here with a group of 9.  The service was good and the chef even came out to greet us.  For appetizer, I got the ukoy (fried batter with vegetable and shrimp).  It was crunchy and tasty.  It reminded me of being a kid and getting ukoy from a street vendor, so far so good. For my entree, I got the kare kare, it was very bony, chewy, and lacked flavor. I was disappointed, but kept it moving.  I have to be honest, if its Filipino food I tend to be biased. I don't need much to be impressed.  Unfortunately, it was not the case here. My friend did get adobo chicken which she reportedly enjoyed.  Usually adobo chicken is made with soy sauce, vinegar and some spices.  She stated that the adobo chicken had coconut milk which tasted good.  Sounds interesting, maybe that is a better choice if I come back there a second time. I guess I ordered the wrong entree. For dessert, I got the halo halo, it's a dessert with shaved ice, sweet milk, ube ice cream, a piece of leche flan, sweetened beans, coconut julienes, and a concoction of other stuff only filipinos would think of putting together.  Really, you can't get it wrong... right? Ugh, it was very underwhelming.   The ube ice cream was tasteless and the mix was just off.  Maybe that's why it is called asian fusion, but for my taste, it was subpar."
1974,1fDtQij01Mk92ZTGn6WHjg,1/18/2020,2 star rating,"I first heard of Purple Yam from an ex boyfriend who promised to take me but never did (hence the ex part). 3 years later, my dreams finally came true.The place smelled so good. Like hot fish oil in a good way, soy sauce, and adobo. I wish you could order food based off fumes alone. My friends ordered the Lechon Kawali, Goat Curry, Sisig, Chicken Adobo, Eggplant Kulawo, and I ordered the Curried Green Market Veggies. We waited quite awhile for our food, and they forgot my order of veggies, so by the time all the dishes were present on the table, I needed a bib for all the saliva coming out of my mouth. I was fuckin' ready.Unfortunately my fever dream was crushed by reality. My veggies looked and tasted like they were frozen, heated up in a microwave, and tossed in watered down coconut milk. No salt, no flavor, no texture. I immediately sent it back. This bag of frozen veggies and fat-free coconut milk is priced at $14.I moved onto the Eggplant Kulawo. This was easily the most offensive thing I've ever tasted. First of all, the eggplant was cold, slimy, and grey. Sour mango slices and miscellaneous vegetables lay on top of the limp nightshade as if they were covering up a crime scene. If you get past the texture, you can almost taste the color grey.The Lechon Kawali was good. Fatty, crispy, but for some reason it was cold. Huge portion, though. The Chicken Adobo was fine as well, but a little dry. The Goat Curry was good, but impeccably tiny. It seems like the most foul dishes here are served in herculean portions, while the flavorful dishes are served in scraps. The Sisig was easily the most flavorful dish. It came out sizzling and gave me heartburn, which is always a good sign.Service was polite but impersonal. Neutral at best. For great Filipino cuisine, do yourself a favor and head to Tito Rad's in Woodside.My ex wasn't trying to disappoint me by avoiding this place. He was trying to protect me. Jason, if you're reading this, I'm sorry for badgering you to have a date night here. It all makes sense now."

My group drinks a lot of water but he quickly refilled our bottles as we finished and everything was quickly served. Had a great time, highly recommend."

They share a parking lot with the bank (no parking) and it seems that everybody prefers to go through the drive-through causing traffic all the way to Amboy Road. When you go inside, the bathroom is hysterical. It's like one of those bathrooms you see in a cheap hotel..The seating area is a scene out of a small town in Oregon. An actual fireplace all year around and the seating arrangements got smaller even though most of the customers got bigger.. Severely understaffed you have to wonder where Wendy's corporation got the ideas from and who got paid off‍ two cash registers, one worker.. you got a love the televisions they installed which keep people here for 2 to 3 hours taking up space two hours after they ate their meal"

I enjoyed the pork soup dumplings here because the dumpling skin was thin and the meat and soup were both very flavorful. The scallion pancakes were super flaky and crispy, it truly felt like they were made in house and the little side of green onions in oil was a great garnish to go on top of the pancakes. The stuffed beancurd tastes just like any other great dim sum place. Only gripe is that their tea pot would cost $6 whereas a normal dim sum restaurant typically charges cheaper or free. The service was quite slow for paying, it took them about 25 minutes after cleaning the table for us to get our check. 6% discount if you pay with cash!"

1990,HM6cvh5A9LLBeb4Sca6fPA,10/2/2021,4 star rating,"Chinatown and Flushing are the quintessential places to get traditional dim sum. I would have never thought that such a place would pop up in Williamsburg. Oh how the times have changed!  The Food!Hargow - Four lovely pieces of dumplings filled with shrimp. The presentation was great, however, the dish lacked the punch of flavor I expected. Pork Soup Dumplings - Six pieces of soup dumplings filled with pork. As a connoisseur of soup dumplings and having made several trips to the best soup dumpling place in the US, Joe's Shanghai, these were simply average. Good, but average! Shumai - Four yummy pieces of dumplings filled with shrimp, pork, and mushrooms. These were fantastic and should be on your table anytime you get dim sum in general. Can't skip out on this one!Stuffed Bean Curd - Tofu skins with pork, bamboo shoot and mushrooms. I promise you that the name of the dish and the ingredients may sound unappetizing, but this dish will excite your taste buds. The texture of the tofu skins paired with the provided soy sauce is a good combination. Lo Mai Gai - Two wrapped up packages of sticky rice with pork, chicken, Chinese sausage, mushroom, and salted egg yolk. Rice, meat, and veggies? Yesssirr, sign me up! This is a good base to add to your selection. Overall, the dishes excellently presented and prepared. However, the I do wish that the portion sizes were bigger. The dishes also tasted a bit watered down compared to your typical dim sum spots."
1991,HM6cvh5A9LLBeb4Sca6fPA,10/17/2022,4 star rating,"Quite pricey compared to other spots in Brooklyn and the other boroughs but the food preparation tastes clean and thoughtfully executed. Great way to get your pork shumai and shrimp hargow fix. Soups are legit as are the tofu skin dim sum and rice noodles with peanut sauce. Wish they had rice rolls like cilantro/scallion but it's all good. The duck in the duck bao was quite crispy - was expecting something more in the realm of Peking. But still enjoyable. The scallion pancakes are more on the ""fluffy"" side (in quotes bc they're still pretty flat) as opposed to more crispy or fried. Spare ribs are yummy. Love the sauce w the spring rolls... has a pepper bite to it that I crave. I order from here regularly when I'm craving dim sum but don't feel like making the trip to Nom Wah or an authentic push cart place."

Not much else to say here; all food is takeout which you can bring to the table outside. Would go again for a Chinese food fix."

I so miss indoor dining because I would've loved to have enjoyed my brunch right there.My friend ordered the Goldie Lox sandwich (Smoked Salmon, Pickled Egg, Avocado, Pickled Red Onion, Tomato, Greens, Mustard). I had the Salmon Toast (Smoked Salmon, Pickled Red Onion, Cream Cheese, Dill, Everything Spice, Capers). Mine was so good! I didn't even pause for air while eating. It vanished in under 2 minutes. I didn't want it to end. The dill and capers included in the mix made me so happy! Boy, can't I wait to go back and try everything else on the menu! It took me damn near 10 mins to order because I couldn't decide between a rice bowl or a sandwich.

My only drawbacks are that there's limited seating, so be prepared that you might not be able to find a spot! FOOD (4/5): Ordered the Seitan Rising breakfast sandwich and a latte with soy milk. The sandwich was pretty good and filling, and a decent price. Love that it wasn't too greasy, as I find vegan meats can get that way. ATMOSPHERE (4/5): Beautiful space with lots of plants and sunlight from large windows in the front. I love that there's both cozy seating options for relaxing and tables if you're looking for serious work (or a more stable place to enjoy your food). STUDYING / WORK (4/5): A great space if you need to get work done! The cafe has free wifi, some outlets, music isn't too loud or distracting, and there's a bathroom available. The tables can be a little too small though if you're looking to work with another friend (aka, there's not much room to fit two laptops)."

The coffees and teas are simple and to the point and the wait time is relatively fast, you won't have to wait longer than a minute.The food and desserts are fine. My biggest gripe is that this is a sandwich and rice spot. If you are on a low carb and surgar diet, your best option is to have the cafe's $9 oatmeal or the scramble egg platter bowl, both of which are available until 11 a.m.The small menu might have something to do with the team being small there is only four people working there at a time.I am curious. Where do the baked goods get made, and how long do they stay on display? They still taste good! I have not eaten a bad pastry yet.One of the worst experience in getting coffee and a meal at a cafe is someone misunderstanding your order. These guys listen very carefully! Another inconvenience is the cleanseness of most cafes. This place, however, is cozy and clean. The bathroom looks like it was decorated like someone's private restroom with a very homey vibe, but at least I know it is clean."

I don't know if it's Covid, or management, but Chez Alex has changed a lot recently. They used to be my go-to neighborhood place for vegan pastries and lunch but after one too many times of getting wrong orders (meat instead of the vegan version- happened a handful of times), inconsistent hours and inability to make food off the menu (a couple times in recent months I tried to call in an order and was told they were too busy or there was no one to cook the food), I can't spend my money or time at Chez Alex anymore. I have also gotten the feeling they are understaffed, and know for sure that the staff today is completely different than the staff from even 6-8 months ago. That can cause any business to seriously struggle with quality and time management, but it feels very apparent when you walk in- which I don't think is a great look. I am writing this in the hopes that someone in charge sees this and takes it into account. I am just one person, but I have seen other order mishaps and overall poor service take place while waiting for food, so I can imagine my feelings are not unique. I hope Chez Alex can get back to the awesome neighborhood cafe it once was, I certainly know they're capable."

I was visiting a friend in Bushwick and staying for a few days/working from her home instead of mine so I can see another human being for once lol, and so I turned to Yelp to find the healthiest lunch options in the area. Chez Alex was an immediate draw with options like the Power Bowl and more. I ended up opting for the curry bowl, with sweet potato, rice, cauliflower, and curry. It was tasty, especially the sweet potato part. I ordered ahead over the phone and my order was ready right when I got there. I will say the place is very small and I was 1 of 4 people in there and there was no way to be at a 6 foot distance, so I was very appreciative of the KN95 I had since while 4 people doesn't seem like many, the space is very small. Double mask for this spot for sure. Very friendly service and honestly really good price for the bowl. Looking forward to trying something else on the menu!"

The pineapple mezcal was good. For apps we split the sunchokes and the tomatoes (which comes with burrata). The little bread croutons in the burrata were epic, really added to the dish. The one that really surprised us was the sunchokes. I have never had these before and the dill and goat cheese it came with was perfect.Finally for my main I had to try the shrimp scampi.

I've heard of this place from a lot of people and I thought it would be a great opportunity to try it out.For the decor, when you walk in, it's like WOW! I missed my opportunity to take a photo of their bar setup since it was stunning and so well put together! The seating, the liquor behind the counter and the look of the entire area was amazing and brought a beautiful charm to this restaurant. Onto the food, the only thing that everybody told me I must order was and is the Scampi dish. I mean, when your name is Scampi and you have it on the menu, that dish better be damn good or else I'd never come back. For the appetizer, we ordered the Delicata Squash appetizer, and for our mains, we had the Mafaldini Scampi, Campanelle, and Gemelli Nero. When that Delicata Squash came out, my mouth started to water a lil bit. As I took my first bite, the cheese melts in your mouth and the flavor was absolutely IN-CRED-IBLE! I wasn't sure if my meal would continue going up or if this was the highlight and the rest of the food would just be okay. Needless to say, the rest of the meal kept going up! Out of the 3 pastas, I would rank Scampi the best, Campanelle second and Gemelli third. However, they were all FANTASTIC pastas that the restaurant makes in house. All in all, Scampi was a 8.2/10 and I could see myself coming back here for quality pasta at an affordable price, along with what looked like very tasty cocktails.IG: @mrtravelfoodie"

I ordered the Brussels salad and throughly enjoyed it. For a starting salad it was also a nice portion. I ordered the Malfadini Scampi and thought it tasted fine. The fish flavor of the shrimp was very pronounced maybe a little too much for my liking but not too bad."
2010,7Wh9KRAcNhwkWDpPocCwng,9/18/2022,4 star rating,Scampi was cool. The service was ok. I went there specifically for the scampi which was pretty good. My only complaint was the amount of shrimp in the scampi there was very little and the shrimps were cut into small pieces.  The breadsticks were so good. Ambiance is nice . Overall cool place .
2011,7Wh9KRAcNhwkWDpPocCwng,7/30/2022,4 star rating,"Mid century decoration and a serviceable Italian restaurant. Prices are pretty high for the food. Appetizers tried were red snapper ceviche, razor clams and Brussels sprouts. My favorite was the razor clams as it was lightly dressed with high quality olive oil. Mains were branzino, octopus, rib eye, shrimp mafaldini and gemelli nero. My favorite was the shrimp mafaldini - QQ noodles with shrimp. Noise level was insanely loud."

I was SO impressed by their service, how well they dealt with dietary restrictions, and how delicious the food was. I tried (with modifications) the tuna tartare, the ribeye, cranberry sorbet, and hazelnut dessert. The hazelnut dessert was heaven. I also cheated a bit and had a few bites of the shrimp scampi, and it was well worth it. The noodles were so yummy and perfectly chewy. Would definitely come here again!"
2013,7Wh9KRAcNhwkWDpPocCwng,1/20/2022,4 star rating,"Scampi is such a romantic restaurant. I love the ambiance inside, I felt so in love!!! The decor was so beautiful and I just kept staring around. We were lucky enough to get seated with no reservations on a Saturday night. It was super busy inside. We were seated in the high bar chairs and the menu was simple and I wanted to eat everything! We ordered 2 pastas and an entree. I love the bread sticks that came out with this tomato salsa, it was so refreshing. We ordered: Campanelle, mezzaluna, and the chicken entree. Our cocktail of the night was the quemadito- it's a must have!!!! It's Smokey from the mezcal and strong.The pastas were so good, I really wanted to pick up the plate and lick up the sauce. The campanelle was not heavy at all and was the perfect amount of broccoli rabe and sausage. The mezzaluna had some plumped raviolis filled with ricotta and pork. Oh my lord, and the pomodoro sauce was so fresh!!!!  The chicken entree took the longest but it was great. It was very flavorful and juicy. The polenta was rich but not too heavy. After these 3 dishes, we did not have room for dessert. We will definitely come back to try more dishes!!!"
2014,7Wh9KRAcNhwkWDpPocCwng,1/7/2022,5 star rating,Scampi was a great spot for our Girls Night Out! We ordered the Tuna Acqua Pazza which came out way too salty we requested to switch it out for the Red Snapper Ceviche which was way better! We had the Mafaldini Scampi and the Cappelletti! I personally didn't feel like it was enough food with the Cappelletti dish but the Scampi I'll be ordering next time it was delicious! The chocolate pudding dessert was great! Drinks are tasty and strong too!
2015,7Wh9KRAcNhwkWDpPocCwng,6/11/2022,4 star rating,Drinks were good here and ambiance was such a cute date/hangout spot. Definitely get the mafaldini scampi which is what this place is known for!!  10/10! Pasta was perfect and the sauce was just so good. This and the Brussel sprouts were my favorite. I would definitely get the shrimp scampi again. We also got the Razor clams which were small and just okay and the ribeye nothing too special. Also tried the mezzaluna which is their ravioli and that was pretty good too! Got the octopus as well which came with rice. We got 6 dishes for 3 people and it was just right!

We were able to sample a few options -- some of them are more like sorbet, others are more traditional ice cream. My favorite was probably the churro flavored ice cream, although I went with the sangria sorbet because it was a little more refreshing. Will definitely be back to try something else next time."

Would be good for 1-2 people, depending on your personal appetite.In the end, my personal favorite was the Red Velvet Martini. It was tasty and had just the right amount of sweetness to it.My second favorite was the Vanilla Bean Bourbon. I thought this one was the most true to its flavor.My third favorite was the Cake Batter Vodka Martini. It was good but the flavor was pretty subtle, both with the cake batter and the vodka.Finally, the Hot Buttered Tum started out as my favorite, but by the end it got too sweet for my own personal liking. They played fun house and hip hop music inside and the employees were friendly. I definitely want to go back and try more flavors!"

Friendly staff and fast service (Depending on weather and time of day). Flavors were basic. You cannot really taste the liquor in the ice cream or sorbet. $12 for a pint was a little pricey for the quality. Liquor went well with the ice creams/sorbet however nothing too special.

2036,6xzVMLQDRq50amj5iLy8jg,10/8/2022,5 star rating,I was so skeptical on this ice cream spot in the neighborhood. Like I genuinely love ice cream. I also genuinely really enjoy a good cocktail. But the idea of alcohol in every bite of my beloved ice cream scared me a bit. We tried the Piña Colada ice cream that was freaking awesome. Over the summer they made boozy bomb pops that were so good and so much fun! Staff is friendly and fun to be around. Def give this place a spot if you are on the fence!! It's good!!

I also found some of the flavors to be too sweet (the cake batter one especially so). My friend got the spiked mint chocolate, which was my favorite flavor, but it honestly just tasted like mint chocolate.... not spiked.The staff were super nice though and their serving size was really generous - their 'one scoop' was as big as two scoops from some places!Go for the novelty of trying it and getting a picture (especially their sundaes), but not worth a return trip."
2039,6xzVMLQDRq50amj5iLy8jg,6/15/2022,3 star rating,"Concept cool, execution lacking The ice cream with booze is a cool idea, and the alcohol content is actually quite high, meaning you will get a kick, especially a full cup which is probs equivalent to a light glass of wine. The issue with alcohol is that the melting point is a lot lower than ice cream, and that means the ice cream melts quite fast. For the caramel leche churro flavor, this means a syrupy semi thick texture with watery outsides, and the ice cream drips all over your hands. In addition, the watery mixture tends to be more of the alcohol, tasting quite strong and unpleasant. For flavors without the caramel like the whiskey chocolate, it gets watery very fast, and isn't pleasant to eat. Btw, fast melting means like seconds from the fridge, not a few minutes. If there was a way to maintain the properties of ice cream texture I think this would be really good."

The bar has a very ""lived in"" vibe with a decorated bar back with photos and knick knacks, etc. There are also arcade games in the very back of the bar near the restrooms. I didn't play any of the games, but saw a few people enjoying them!On the weekends, they have a happy hour that starts at 3pm and ends at 9pm. Even though we got our order in seconds after it turned 9, our drinks were still counted as happy hour which was great! I started off with their frozen daiquiri. It sneaks up on you and even though you can't taste the alcohol, you definitely start feeling it pretty soon afterwards. The drinks here were pretty solid and even though I don't remember the other things I ordered (!!), the vibe was super chill and I liked it. The music didn't drown you out and you could hold a conversation at a reasonable noise level. This place is also cash only, but if you forget to bring cash, there's an ATM on the premises. Definitely check this place out when you're in the Brooklyn area!"

Like, who still carries cash nowadays?Ok, now that I have gotten that quick rant out of the way. This is a nice bar in the ""heart"" of Bushwick. The crowd is pretty much what you would expect of the new crop of Brooklynites. The bar is pretty standard with standard dive bar flair. It reminds me a bit of the lower east side before it became lame. The bartenders were nice and the service was fairly prompt for a Saturday evening. All and all, I'd come back again."

This new bar staple is right by the J/M Myrtle/Broadway stop. The bar is your standard ode to the seventies bars. The bar has a Gene Simmons doll at the bar, pinball machines, glowing horse light, fussball table, Christmas lights and a bull skull. Birdy's is huge, a great place to keep in mind for large groups. There is a front bar with booth, then some funny two person table setting and then the large back room with the games. People took it upon themselves to christen the two tops for their spring fever!  Lots of suck face.The music last night was just what I wanted and have forgotten about. They were playing Buzzcocks and Sham69. There's also a pretty good beer selection. They even had my favorite Bell's Two Hearted IPA. My friend called a cab at the end. It was going to be eight minutes..hmm not enough time for a beer and two much time for a shot. We got one cider and the bartender split it for us into two vintage chalices. Nice!Thanks to the co owners and band mates from the local goth band Weeknight, Holly MacGibbon and Andy Simmons for opening my new fave punk, watering hole.

2049,q-mcY-p-mkOZ4TPdySeumg,12/11/2018,3 star rating,"I recently moved to Brooklyn and was looking for a local bar when I found Birdy's. You walk in to a dimly lit room with low ceilings, bar on the left, seating on the right. There's not much room to navigate if the place is packed. If you keep walking back through the bar you'll find more seating, foosball tables, photo booth and bathrooms. The bathrooms are covered in graffiti, which gives it the grungy Brooklyn vibe. I couldn't help but snap a couple pictures, though the graffiti was so thick there was no mirror, which I loved. Keeps the line moving! I think the drinks are the best part about this bar. The Long Islands taste great. The frozen drinks are even better ! They have a line of typical drinks made frozen, like margaritas, frozen whiskey sours and frozen Moscow mules. All the drinks are reasonably priced and they have a late night menu for those drunk nights you just probably shouldn't be cooking. I spent 8 dollars on my frozen drink. An alcoholic beverage under $10 is a steal in my book! My least favorite part about this bar is the staff, as I've been to Birdy's on several occasions I have had an array of experiences. You never have to wait long before someone acknowledges that you've sat down or are waiting. The bartenders either have a stick up their ass or are just always rude because management doesn't tell them being kind to patrons is part of the experience. This is the sole reason I am giving Birdy's a 3/5 rating. I recently had a unpleasant encounter with a bouncer at Birdy's. I am pleased to say that the owner Andy reached out to me and kindly consoled me that this was not something that would be tolerated at Birdy's. I really respect the concern and quick response on Yelp. I have decided to change my review because of her kindness. Birdy's does have an array of fun activities outside of drinking. Such as, arcade games, food ball and a photo booth. Which is all super fun and extremely competitive when intoxicated.  The bathrooms are gender neutral and their are two of them."

Not only is the quality of the food not consistent but the staff tends to be rude as well.First, I came here for the Rick and Morty inspired Poster and or Sauce. With my luck there wasn't any left by the time I got in which was about 15 minutes after launch (Still waited on a line). I decided to just get something to eat anyways (Which I am sure is what McDonalds had banked on for this SUPER LIMITED PROMOTION) and while I was waiting to be rung up- I saw a man in a button up shirt and a tie start walking through the kitchen to the back room with the Rick and Morty inspired posters!Naturally I asked the girl at the counter if I could grab one of those posters and she just kept telling me that they were sold out. I let her know that I physically saw them being walked to the back and asked who that person was. She said it was her manager and when I asked what his name was she refused to give it to me saying it shouldn't matter if he got posters for himself.I let her know how wrong that was for a limited promotion meant for CUSTOMERS but she stood firm on her ground of not giving me his name, when I enquired as to why it mattered if she gave me his name or not she finally said ""Because I have to work here"".Fair enough, my ire is not directed towards you but what kind of Manager is this if your staff is afraid to give out your name?I finally saw the manager (Asked him his name, he had no issues giving me it as Carlos Roldan) again and approached him asking about the posters. His first response to me was that ""they were claimed"". When I asked again he said ""They're claimed for the office"". I pressed him again and he said that they were claimed for his Supervisor (Which he told me her name was Mary Vennanam).I let him know how wrong it was to keep limited promotional items for employees (I've worked in retail for a long time and as unfun as it sounds, when something is super limited- it's for the customers. I mean that's the whole point! Some customers travel far and wide for these things (No matter what it is) and to just give it to someone who comes in for work- It's just very unprofessional and wrong. If you have a problem with this logic, then let me know how people who wait on line for new sneakers feel when employees of said establishment do the same thing).To his credit, he didn't seem to not agree with me, in any case I requested to talk to a real person above him (His Supervisor just left as she secured her posters, likely to be sold on eBay along with what I am sure includes Schezwan sauces also held on the side) and the number he gave me was for a Long Island office that is closed on the weekends.Terrible experience and an awful way to run a promotion. Not only that but still no response from McDonald's after posting to their Facebook.EDIT: And while I was waiting I did order a McChicken and McDouble. The lettuce on the McChicken was sad and stringy and the bread on the McDouble tasted dry and old on the edges, blech."

It had a sesame taste to it and complemented the rest of the flavors of the bun. The white peach sake was amazing as well. It was definitely sweeter than traditional sake and tasted more like a cocktail. It's something I could definitely see enjoying on a regular basis casually.BUT THIS RAMEN THOUGH. The broth stole the show. It was good on its own, but the garlic oil brought it to the next level. Seriously, I could drink this broth. The noodles were exactly what you want them to be (soft and fresh), the egg was cooked perfectly, and the pork was good and flavorful. I could eat this ramen every day for the rest of my life and be perfectly happy.The portions were huge. I wanted to finish because it was so good, but there was no way.The place is tiny. It only has like five tables, so be prepared to wait. But I promise it's worth it."

I can boldly claim that Susuru Ramen is the BEST ramen spot in ALL of NYC. Not just Queens. PERIODT. For first timers, I highly recommend the Susuru Paitan. The milky white chicken broth takes quite some time to achieve so I truly think it deserves its own stage without any additive flavors. Every component of the Paitan makes the bowl so well-rounded. You have the melt-in-your-mouth seared char siu, the bouncy chewy noodles and the perfect soft boiled ajitsuke tamago. It's evident that the chef really thought out how each of the ingredients contribute to the overall flavor development of the Paitan masterpiece. Once you have a moment to indulge Paitan in all its glory, try the Kuro. The black garlic oil definitely enhances the flavor of the chicken broth even more.For apps, my boyfriend and I ordered the chashu bun, the sesame cucumber, and the takoyaki. All of these are solid choices but I would say the ramen here is really the star of the show. All in all, I'm really happy that I found this unicorn. I'm so happy I found my go-to!!"
2062,W1lhp2SkrO-rVqTmnUCxrw,3/7/2023,5 star rating,We ordered takoyaki and two ramens. Arrived pretty early and there was already a group of people waiting. It's a cute shop with good food and flavoring. Ramen tasted more handmade (more doughy/chewy) than other shops but I might be a little crazy. Broth wasn't too salty which I liked. My friend considered it as one of the best places she's been to.

Highly recommend Tantan 3.5/5: mediocre soup base flavor; would pass on this KARAGE 4/5: nice and crispy texture fried chicken Shrimp katsu bun 4/5: nice and crispy but lacking some shrimp; you'll enjoy this if you like fried food Takoyaki 4.5/5: nicely fried; but smaller than usual! Grapefruit sake 4.5/5: fruity and taste like soda; you don't even taste the alcohol I must be dreaming beer 4.5/5: this was veryyyy good if you like something fruity Oh... 4.5/5: I don't enjoy IPAs but my friend who does loved it and got a second one Would absolutely visit again!!

The karaage is so crispy and juicy. I thought the sauce was spicy with the color but it's actually not and goes so well with the karate. It's a great location to meet up with a few friends, they have some tables outside and some inside, but it is not a whole lot of seating. So there are usually waits on busy nights!"

We started off with some apps-chicken karaage, shrimp katsu bun, and chashu bun. The chicken karaage was my favorite and I'll prob order 2 servings next time!For the ramen, we got the paitan ramen (chicken broth, pork chashu, ajitama egg, and bamboo shoots) and the kuro ramen (basically the same as the paitan ramen but with added black garlic oil). After having them both, they're both really good, but the Kuro ramen gives you that added depth of flavor and umami from the black garlic oil. We also ordered the chili oil on the side. It's not spicy, but also adds that extra flavor element as well. Overall, solid ramen joint in Astoria. The employees are so stinking nice and helpful. Can't say enough good things about this place!"

Glad I did because these Yelp reviews were the reason why we ended up at this spot! The interior is really cute and the staff are very nice. They have limited seating so we did have to wait for a table but it was so worth it. This was one of the best ramen I'd ever had in my life. We started with the edemame, which was salted and had a good texture. My dining partner thought it was too salty but I thought it tasted great. The chashu bun was delicious. The pork was extraordinarily seasoned and the bun was fluffy. the sauce they used had a kick to it and everything paired really well together. The ramen was flavorful. The noodles were a great texture and the broth was so good I drank it all. Again, the pork was to die for. An all around great meal for a good price. Happy I found this place and can't wait to be back"

The waitress was nice and was really helpful when it came time to place our order Besides the ramen I also enjoyed a matcha beer , sounds weird but it was so delicious . Definitely a must try ! There's plenty of metered and street parking . Definitely stop by if you're in the mood for some great ramen."
2068,W1lhp2SkrO-rVqTmnUCxrw,12/12/2022,4 star rating,"Based on my first impression, I would rate it a 4. At first, this shop took a bit of time looking for... The store currently doesn't have a name sign posted up. From the exterior, it looks like the store is in construction, but thats deceiving. Inside, it's a fully operating business. When you walk in, you see a few tables. It isn't a big store and I can see it getting really packed at times. Luckily for me and my friends, we just walked in on a weekend around 1pm-ish and was seated right away. When we got to ordering, I thought to myself that this place seems authentic based on that fact that there were actually Japanese staff and servers and a couple of Japanese customers as well, which was good to know. My friends and I ordered both the Chashu Pork Buns and the Susuru Paitan. Chashu Pork BunsWhenever I see pork buns on the menu, I'm always tempted to get it. Hence, I decided to try it out. The pork itself wasn't as fatty as I prefer it, but it's a solid pork bun. I did enjoy the sauce as well. Susuru PaitanI've always seen most ramen places that have pork broths and limited non-pork options, but here, it's quite the opposite. Everything is either chicken or vegetable broth. As for the Susuru Paitan, it is chicken broth based. It definitely has a smooth/warm chicken broth taste. The color is white, so it's probably more creamy. But it's perfect for a cold day outside. The only things that I would have changed in this dish was the meat and the egg. The egg was definitely colder. You can tell they refrigerated it before they placed it inside the soup. When I bit into it, the yolk wasn't runny and looked more solid than I would have preferred - needed a bit of warming in the soup. And also, the chashu that they put in the soup looked more like a beef slice. It's not the typical fatty pork belly that I love, so that was a bit of unexpected surprise. Despite all that, I did enjoy everything. I did enjoy how rich the flavor tasted. I also liked that despite originally thinking I needed kaedama (extra noodles), I actually felt satisfied from the whole meal. Overall, I did have a good experience. But as for me, there definitely could be improvements for my personal ramen preferences."

To be honest with you I haven't been a fan of KFC since they stop using regular cooking oil and started using hydrogenated oil whatever that is. It's like they change the recipe. From the 70s to the mid 90s the chicken had excellent flavor not anymore. So my issue with them today is on July 12, 2019 on my lunch break I went into the store to purchase the five dollar fill up the pot pie the cookie with a soda I got to say I do love the pot pie but the one I purchased was very dry it's like it's been sitting around for days so I took it back and employee gave me another pot pie.  to my surprise that one was dry as well I don't know if they're serving old food or what, my final words I'm done with KFC"

The place seems pretty clean, too - I was impressed by the cleanliness at the late hour I visited, when most places seem to be letting themselves go.The food, of course, was traditional KFC fare. Greasy, probably not poisonous, but exactly what I needed at the moment. Stale cookie, weird potatoes, that's the KFC life."

2074,YV0VaJgV2zotzI7XNUaMCQ,4/6/2011,3 star rating,"After I left Sweet Revenge, I was heading over to the Bedford-Nostrand G stop. Two Hefenweisens in an empty stomach didn't make me drunk, but did impair my judgment to the point that KFC seemed like The Place to Be. Walked in there to see two guys from the 'hood; one leaning back with his meal in a booth, and the other on the phone, getting a horrendously huge order for his whole family. One staff member stood behind the bulletproof (one hopes/assumes) glass shield separating the cash register and kitchen from Everything Else (namely, the threat of a hold-up or other type of assault).  The other red-shirted staff member was out and about with a mop, completely unprotected. Watching him busily sweep the steaming mop over the small area, I had a flashback to the only other time I'd been in this exact chain. It was prior to the NFL Playoffs. Lost on the way to a purported party nearby, I walked in here to quench my parched throat with a big gulp of orange soda. In the process, I heard the two ladies on shift talking loudly about murders with jealousy as the motive.You know, as much as I love the Colonel (my birthday twin), he should have thought of more sandwiches. Even the most flagrant carnivore cringes a little at the thought of a ""Double Down,"" and so did I. Thus, I was forced to resort to the ""Doublicious,"" and was pondering what is double about the Doublicious. It didn't have two fried chicken breasts, so I could only conclude that the double referred to the fact that the sandwich had (1) fried chicken and (2) bacon. As in double trouble, ya see.Gave my order and the last of what cash I was willing to give through the clear turnstile. After my order was given to me in a paper sack, I called out, ""Ooh, may I please have a ranch sauce, too?""""Just one?"" She asked.""blyeah,"" I confirmed, bleakly.""Eleven cents,"" She said. What an arbitrary financial deterrent to stuff that it probably takes negative eleven cents to produce.""What?! No thanks,"" I said, and started shuffling out of there, when the guy who'd been sitting down stood up. He was a very big dude. ""How much? Eleven cents?!"" he said, ""I'll buy you a ranch sauce. God DAMN, charging for that shit - we in the HOOD here,"" he said.""Uh HUUUUH."" Family man concurred, rolling his eyes. His children would NOT be having extra sauce tonight.Meanwhile, I was scratching around in my purse for coins, trying to prove that I was not destitute, but that forgoing the sauce had been a matter of principle. ""I have a penny..."" I said, pathetically.Guy threw down a shiny dime, and I had my sauce. ""Have a good night, mami,"" he said. I skipped down to the train feeling better than if James Bond had bought me a martini. It's this random act of kindness from a Bed-Stuy local (and maybe the fastidiousness of the moppers) that make this place worth mentioning. It certainly wasn't the sandwich with its limp bread and oiled down meat. The sauce sucked, too, tasting more like relish and pondwater than ranch. But let's not be ungrateful."

Several politicians came in to defend him rights because one of the gun owners was white. The whole thing was bananas. Just completely crazy. But the staff was calm throughout this entire showdown. They took orders and served food with a smile. Why? Because they serve the fried chicken from behind bulletproof glass! Nothing can fluster this team because they are safer than reading.

To avoid contact, I advised him to come up stairs and leave it at the doorstep.  He decides to come upstairs after I told him to cancel the order. He then rings the bell and tell him just leave it on the doorstep multiple times. He then proceeds to yell that if I don't come downstairs(in the future) he will cancel my order going forward. I exchanged so unpleasant words which I will not post on yelp. Today my family has come to visit and they really like their food. So I decided to place an order and  right after call to request they don't send the rude delivery guy but the normal guy that comes to my house.  I call and Gave my name and order, he told me that they are making it. I told him I normally order from you guys regularly and the last guy was really rude, can you please send the normal delivery guy?  The guy said you are going to have to come downstairs to pick up the delivery.

I couldn't read the sign so at the register I asked for the following which amounted in $40 flat, which I thought was unusual regardless of the place possibly being a tourist trap. The cashier again assured me that I was paying the right price when I asked if $32 for a large pizza with one topping was correct and a small salad was $8. Still skeptical once I arrived home I looked up the menu online to see that I had been extremely overcharged. A large pepperoni is $20 flat and the salad I asked for is $6 so I am a little confused to where my remaining $14 went towards. I called back and explained the issue and the gentleman on the phone said that I had paid for an XXL Pizza, which does not exist. Extremely disappointed!!! Thanks for pocketing my change."

The baristas are all really nice and efficient but the reason why I wanted to make a review was because this time, although she was nice, the barista who took my order seemed distracted so made my iced order into hot and I had to wait a little bit which wasn't a big deal. But when I got my order, it was a little warm as if they had put in ice but everything was so hot all the ice immediately melted! I didn't want to wait again for my order to be fixed but it tastes or just feels funny having an iced drink with no ice and is lukewarm.But on the plus side, there's a lot of spacious seating and even some cushions by the window like it's a little nook!"
2102,S55v4pq633nTz7jbGmrCfg,3/1/2018,3 star rating,"Efficient, and open late when compared to other Starbucks! Open till 11PM is always a plus. The inside is PACKED during the day and usually around 1-3pm there's no place to sit in side. When it's crowded staff moves slowly with IDGF mentality but for the most part my drinks are usually good and they keep the line moving."

Most of the time the staff is quick and friendly but I've had some who aren't as nice. I hate the fact that every time I ask for a bakery item, the staff asks whether I want it heated to which I reply no. But when I receive it, it's piping hot. Stop heating my muffin!! I'm always in a rush so I can't make a complaint or grab another but it's quite annoying. Otherwise, it's a cool spot and I continue to visit daily."

The to go orders are always priority, time after time my coffee has uncooked coffee beans at the bottom, and it takes them 15min to heat up one morning bun. (Mind you, there's usually just one to two others on line) I will give it two stars because I'm lucky enough to get a pleasant barista. Once they see me waiting there for awhile they get on it.  Also the coffee is usually burnt, unfortunately...."

It is hard to screw up a hot chocolate (or rather any drink because there is a fixed ""recipe"" for each and everything here). The guy making the drinks is probably one of the rudest and definitely does not know what he is doing there. He literally did not put any chocolate or sugar/vanilla syrup in my drink - it was as if I am drinking plain hot milk which obviously is horrendous!  I had already gone out of the store before I started drinking it so could not complain (but I doubt if my doing so would've changed the attitude of the barista).Note to self: always taste the drink while at Starbucks so you can get another one made instead."

I submitted a Mobile Order and it took almost 30 minutes to get an Iced Chai. This place was utter chaos. Blenders without tops on, frappucinos shooting everywhere (lol) and baristas calling out to patrons as if it were a bar, ""Hey, what did you order? What about you? You?"" Literally making one drink at a time and whoever yelled out their order the loudest was served first. The staff is consistently rude and classless. I came in another time to pick up a Mobile Order and as soon as I walked in one of the baristas yelled at me, ""SERVICE ANIMALS ONLY!"" Luckily, I have a service dog but it was embarrassing to say the least. The baristas both kept talking behind the counter about how gross it is to bring dogs into an establishment where there's food. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but at the end of the day, your job is to make drinks and be polite to customers, not give your opinions. I've NEVER in all my years of visiting Starbucks have ever been called out for bringing in a dog. If anything, I'm asked if I would like a Puppuccino or baristas simply say I have a cute dog. There's no reason to yell out and embarrass paying customers. This place could use a little class, training, and overall etiquette. Go to 60th and 3rd Ave where the baristas are kind, consistent, and have class."

I understand we're in the middle of a pandemic and things are a bit crazy, but that's not an excuse for straight up not making drinks correctly.

I repeated my order about 4 times and STILL it was made wrong I just don't understand. They need to retrain these workers because they clearly can't get the ordered correct ever.
2116,td-ANnbKeuQ0Z-XwWgxWaA,3/16/2020,2 star rating,"Usually I don't write reviews but this was ridiculous. I order a caramel Frappuccino every morning with a pump of peppermint without a problem. The one time AMANDA makes it, it becomes a huge ordeal. First I asked if she put peppermint in the drink cause I didn't taste it at all and she said yeah I put one pump. I told her I didn't taste it like I usually do when everyone else makes my drink. So she hands me a small cup with a pump of peppermint. I'm like what should I do with this? I can't mix it into the frappuccino. It's just gonna sit on the top of the drink... She then has the nerve to say I don't know. So I'm still calm and asked if she could just remake the drink. She said it'll take a few minutes so I waited. Then she comes back and said we ran out of coffee. At 6:45 IN THE MORNING. WHEN THEY OPEN AT 6 AM. Everyone else in the store is amazing but I've never had to deal with Amanda until today and don't know why she still has a job there. I've seen her treat her coworkers  and other customers so disrespectfully."

If you want the use the bathroom, you have to squeeze past the line, go up to the counter, request the door code, and then squeeze back past the line and people coming in through the door to get to the corner. There are seats outside (no tables) on the sidewalk plaza, but it's a busy corner and not an especially enjoyable place to sit.  There aren't a ton of coffee shops within a few blocks of here, but don't bother with this Starbucks, even if you have a gift card you're itching to spend."

Not much to speak of as far as decor & service was ok, otherwise I would have given 5 stars, but the food made up for the other shortcomings! After reading reviews, I tried the ribs & will agree with reviews- awesome!!! I had the lunch special which included soup, spring roll, rice & ribs. Great value."

The wonton and spring rolls were good. I would probably come back if it weren't for the steep prices and terrible parking situation ( 25 min). I wish I would've ordered the sweet and sour and citrus protein.Pros: All vegan, Good appetizers and drinksCons: Expensive, Too many options on the menu"

Included were a fork & knife set napkins and miso soup. The portion sizes are good enough for one person I'd definitely say.Now for the food I ordered the Korean glass noodles at 1st I wasn't to sure of the taste but it was definitely tasty I've never really had anything that tasted like this, so it took some time for me to properly realize if I liked it or not, I do remember it being a bit spicy but nothing overwhelming. I did enjoy the noodles though!Next up are those bbq ribs with salad and rice it's amazing honestly better then actually bbq rip tips and way better for you.

Food was ready in 25 mins, packed nicely, hot when we got it home. Based off yelp reviews, we ordered the scallion pancakes, BBQ ribs, black pepper seitan, pumpkin cheesecake and their Thai iced tea. And let me tell you - the BEST vegan Asian food I've ever had. PLEASE GET THE BBQ RIBS! Not only are they flavorful, it's charred and smoky, and I'm not sure how they did it. Can't wait to return again! It's hard finding good plant-based/vegetarian friendly restaurants, especially minority owned. Will continue to return to support local business!"

However a Sunday night 9:45pm visit on the drive thru line warrants this 0 star review. The drive thru line reached the street which was not overly alarming as I've seen other locations handle equally long lines in less than 5 mins. However I wasted 30 minutes by staying on this line. One window for payments and for giving the food. Seemed like they did not start ""cooking"" the order until the payment was rung up. Abysmal. Lady at the window did seem to be moving with purpose though, so seems like flaws with their overall process."

There is NO excuse for us to be in the drive thru line for over 30 minutes just to place my order! Making us take our order at the window is unacceptable. If there is an order speaker box we shouldn't have to wait till we get to a window for our order to be taken! This NEEDS to be addressed! The person at the order window is VERY unprofessional. HE works the midnight shift! The date is 5/6/2021 at 12:55am. He should not be working if he is in customer service! He shouldn't't be working with an attitude like if he's the owner of the place!

Also I wouldn't have used that bathroom at all. There was also pee on the floor. They should clean more. Then, I've been waiting since 10 for it to be 10:30 for lunch. Due to I hate Mcdonalds breakfast. I walked in at 10:25 and I asked the employees and they said, ""Yes, lunch starts at 10:30."" Yet it is 10:38,and no lunch yet. You might think I'm exaggerating but I'm starving. And as I'm writing this review, one employee is saying lunch is at 11. I'm really annoyed. If they don't give me lunch with in the next 5 minutes.

I explain to the women I needed fresh hot fries because I had to bring them home. She took the fries and went over to the young lady working over by the fries and told her what I had said. Mind you I touch these fries and tasted one. The women at the fry station take my fries I had just turned in put them back into the fryer area mixes them with the new fries and dish me up new fries with the ones I just turned. Now not only is this Covid time but I had taken a bite one of the fries and put it back in the container thinking she was going to throw them away. The young women who took them from me saw me do this. When she brought me back my 'NEW' fries I explain to her that she now contaminating all the fries she looked at me and said so what's the big deal. What am I crazy I could infect 1000's of people if I had Covid and didn't know it are you crazy. I was so upset I demanded my money back and left this is crazy. I'm call the board of health.

Huge slice of pizza that they do warm up in the oven and comes out hot!  Just a nice place to get the pizza craving.  They offer a variety of different types of pizza as well."

I really don't understand those 5 stars' reviews. Did they ever have a good pizza? Speechless... It would not hurt if they swept the place more frequently. There are so many places in NYC; please avoid--a tourist trap.

With that being said, everyone talks about how GOOD NY pizza is. Pair that with a late night craving after drinks... the last thing you want or expect is to be let down. It's hard to do that with pizza. Unfortunately, It was pretty mediocre to say the least. The flavor was eh. I've had better pizza in Florida."

There isn't a lot of seating but we found a spot in the front where we could stand and enjoy the pizza.I had a caprese pizza slice that was delicious. The crust was crispy and thin, the sauce very flavorful, and mozzarella was fresh. My picky little one had a cheese slice and she devoured it!  She wants to go by again tomorrow for another slice!We'll definitely be back!"

I got the White pizza and I thought it was good, but not mind blowing! I remember my cheese pizza was literally mind blowing, so I was a tad disappointed. The crust was still crispy and delicious - but I think the White lacks a bit in the flavor department. Line still moves super fast - they raised their prices due to inflation!

Stood in a small line outside; the space inside is very small and only a few tables to sit and eat at. The service was very quick and friendly. The location was small but had a ton of character, and a very warm environment.FOOD: Classic New York pizza and super flavorful. We got the classic pepperoni and the supreme pizza; loved both of them. It was thin crust pizza, greasy, and huge. Overall: when you visit New York make sure Joe's is part of your travel plans. There's ton of great new York pizza spots, but this was the best."

Instead of going downtown, we stopped by their branch in midtown since our hotel was in the area. My first impressions of the place was that it's your typical pizza joint -- nothing special expect maybe for the pictures of famous people on their walls. The place was clean enough, had lots of napkins, condiments, and smelled yummy. Pros: - hot, fresh from the oven- thin, crisp crust - generous toppings- reasonably priced- fast service - tasted wonderful Cons:- carbs if you're not a big fan Why the 4? While their slices were good, we tried other pizza joints which were just slightly better."

On our way to a local pizza competitor which we've had years before, we saw the line for Joe's Pizza winding up the sidewalk.  My son said it's the best pizza in Michigan, so we decided to take our place in this somewhat fast moving line. It's takeout only with places to sit inside or out if you're lucky to snag a spot.  We grabbed some slices of fresh Mozzarella and pepperoni.  It was so greasy, we had to dab it with napkins.  It was good, but not great.  I like the fact we can just order slices and it was good enough to eat  NY style. On the run and folded up like a sandwich!"

If you're looking for quick and fast action this is the place. 100% grab and go. There are seats and tall tables that run along the walls for standing but this place is packed all the time. Best to grab and go. It was normal good pizza but it didn't live up to the hype. It's a cool place for photo as they clearly advertise that it was seen in spider-man.

It seemed like they had a full staff of 4 people. Two in front, two in the back of the house making the food.My husband ordered the ham and cheese crepe, I got the goat cheese and roasted pear. Both are served on buckwheat crepes so they are naturally gluten free!I don't eat ham, but ham and cheese is a classic and my husband was pleased with his dish. I also really enjoyed my meal, though I would've loved for maybe a creamy brie instead of goat cheese. (Maybe that's sacrilegious? I don't know much about french food.) My meal also came with a little side salad with a lovely light mustardy dressing.We'll definitely be coming back, because while we were sitting the table next to us and behind us both ordered the french toast. They looked pillowy and epic served with an assortment of jams. We will definitely return to try this!"

The waitstaff were so pleasant and friendly, offering alternatives and suggestions for some of the items that were out. Let me tell you, the French toast are light fluffy sweet doughnuts on a skewer. I'm not a donut person but my tiny bite turned into the dollap sized sweet treat. It comes 6 in an order which I felt were quite generous. One was plenty. We had to pack it up to bring home so the kids can try, boy were they delicious!!Their dishes are pretty and neatly presented, portions are ideal for brunching and the location is airy, and relaxing.

The corned beef hash is simply delectable. The flavors are perfectly balanced between the beef, potatoes and the poached egg in hollandaise sauce. Their elevated take on the dish is definitely worth trying. The French toast though!!! They have a delicately sweet taste and still have a little crispness beneath the drizzles of the syrup. The thing about their French toast is that some of the sweetness come from the bread itself versus mostly of it coming from the syrup on top. They definitely have a flavor that is unique to their French toast. That is undeniable.All in all, amazing!"

Background house music along with some french/European decorations set a unique ambiance Waitress was extremely friendly and we ordered brunch option 1 & 2:Homemade Iced Tea - distasteful; str8 sugar and water w/either passion fruit or raspberry flavoring ; ingredients just not right/mix wellIced Coffee - refreshing and came w/ syrup on side to self-determine level of caffeine  Quiche  - amazingly melt in your mouth soft. Good salt level, somewhat buttery, mushroom was not overwhelming and admirable portion size.Egg Florentine - basically egg benedicts w/spinach amongst other toppings. Salad - came in a small bowl ; fresh veggies w/right amount of dressing.Food came out quick and experienced fast service overall. Waitress was kind enough to completely exchange my iced tea for something else. Price to portion/taste ratio within standards. Will return for other items."

My friend & I ordered apps & the waitress asked us if we would like some bread with our apps ( we thought it was complimentary since she was the one who brought it up & asked.)  When we got the check we saw that we were charged $6.95 for bread . The way she spoke to us was  VERY MISLEADING ,giving  us the impression that the bread came with the meal free of charge , but that was not the case.- At the end of our dinner  I asked the server if  we could split the apps down the middle  & pay for our dish  but she cut me off & said "" NO I AM NOT GOING TO DO THAT.""  I understand sometimes splitting the check can be annoying especially if it's busy, but there was only  3 other tables in the restaurant , it was NOT BUSY at all.  I guess she just wanted to continue to chat with the other server at the host stand - We ended up just splitting the bill down the middle & noticed that they ADDED 20% gratuity on the check. Nowhere on the menu or anything suggest that there even would remotely be auto gratuity added to the check, especially for a 2 top. I work in a restaurant & it is a common practice to  add auto gratuity to large groups of people & even then I let the group know that auto gratuity is included in the bill. In conclusion, spending $127 here was absolutely not worth it . The clams were good & they were very good with refilling our water"

The restaurant was founded and is owned by members of the Ianniello family...how can you pass up a spot where a mobster was killed! Food was subpar... baked clams were dried pucks. The lobster ravioli was primarily a large piece of pasta with almost no lobster. Covered in a watered down sauce which seem to be similar to a storebrand jar sauce.  I was really looking forward to this and I'm quite disappointed in the quality of food."

I was one of the few unlucky ones who were not able to get a reservation but I got to the restaurant right when it opened and was able to snag a seat outdoors. Thankfully enough there are heaters, curtains, and even music for the outdoor seating. My friend and I ordered the infamous lasagna and garlic bread. The best way I can describe it is that both items just melted into your tastebuds. It was such a serene feeling. You just had to be there. This place is on the pricier side but 100% worth every penny. We even had some leftovers to go because it was that filling. It was such a great experience and I can see myself definitely coming back again."

From the food to the ambiance and service, everything was top notch and up to par with what I expected from this difficult reservation, Michelin spot. We were a party of four and split everything as a table. For our appetizers we had the chrysanthemum salad, stuffed garlic flatbread and the gnocchi. Everything was delicious but the gnocchi was by far the star for me, I've never had such a delicate and soft/pillow-like bite of gnocchi before. For the mains, we had the steak, lasagna, and buffalo milk carmelle pasta with a side of sweet potatoes. The lasagna of course was absolutely delicious as it was beautiful. The carmelle pasta was very unique with sweet and savory elements alongside the candy-shaped pasta. In additional, I highly recommend the sweet potatoes - that one surprised us all.We skipped dessert due to bringing in our own cake for the occasion, they charged a $5 plating fee per person. My boyfriend was also able to purchase the Don Angie cookbook while we were there since it was sold out online. Overall fantastic spot, I highly recommend checking it out!"

Because the food was just delicious and the service was awesome.We ordered:Chrysanthemum salad - This salad was really good but honestly nothing too special. It's just a really good dish to have with vegetables just because Italian food can be pretty heavy. Although I did really enjoy the sesame, because it gave it a really nice crunch. Stuffed garlic flatbread - garlicky, buttery, cheesy. Need I say more? But really, this appetizer was awesome. If they marketed it as pizza and sold it as a bigger main entree, I would still eat the whole thing. After we finished it, all I could think about was how I wish we had more. Our lasagna for two - Don Angie's signature dish truly lived up to the hype. While the name lists the dish for two, our table of four got decently full with this and the other plates we got. But not only is the lasagna so pretty, but everything tastes so fresh. While filling, the pasta and cheese felt very light and not dense at all. This dish also came with some focaccia that easily could have been it's own dish. Some of the best bread I've ever had truly. The outside is toasted and crispy, but the inside of the bread was so soft it literally melted in my mouth. I don't think I've ever used that phrase to describe bread before but here we are. Japanese Sweet Potatoes - also a great choice, after I became full, my fork kept coming back to these potatoes. The sauce in this dish is also very parmesan and garlic forward, but in all of the best ways. It was the perfect balance of crispy and soft. And I kept forgetting they were sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes until I bit in and the sweetness kicked in."

Almost everything we ordered was a total delight, but the chrysanthemum salad and Japanese sweet potato really stole the show for me. They were both so light and tasty.  And don't even get me started on the lasagna - pure comfort in every bite. Just be warned, the bread that comes with it is super buttery, so save it for last or skip it altogether if you don't want to be overwhelmed.But the real cherry on top was the service. The staff were all so friendly and attentive, we never felt rushed to leave even after we finished eating. All in all, Don Angie is worth the hype, so definitely try it out!"

2173,VRfXwMDG8zA71GphHfeMKg,3/5/2023,3 star rating,"Overrated. Long story short I discovered there were 5-10 Italian restaurants in the city that had very difficult reservations to get. As silly as this sounds, this exclusivity factor is what made me embark on a quest to try as many of these restaurants as possible.Comparing with restaurants like via carota, misi, L'artusi, and I sodi, this was by far the most average of the bunch. The restaurant is a simple room with a bar, and a handful of tables. Service was extremely fast. We started with the flatbread, fried rice, and the salad. I will say the salad was good, and the fried rice was a fun twist, but everything was extremely salty and the flavors one dimensional. Following this we went with the lasagna, of course, and the sourdough pasta, which we got by accident? Accompanying this we got the sweet potatoes. The lasagna is beautiful, and it is good, however I would say it's something you could definitely try just once solely to say you had it. It is just lasagna after all, and it certainly was not anything mind blowing. The sourdough pasta I'd skip. Potatoes were tasty though. The ambience is heavily lacking, as you feel you could be in any restaurant, both in terms of service and environment. That was honestly my biggest gripe with the restaurant amongst the other issues. Is it worth a try once, sure, but please don't jump through any hoops to go to this place."

Food: Food was amazing - one of the best lasagnas I've had in the city. I also really liked how the plate was presented; it's unique, iconic and memorable. Our table also got the chrysanthemum salad, which was my favorite dish of the day. The sesame added dimension to the dish and while the leafy vegetables were well coated in dressing, the dish felt light and refreshing. The last dish our table ordered was the garlic flatbread.

Reservation tips: They release reservations 7 days in advance on Resy. Mondays and Tuesdays seem to be the easiest days to get a last-minute reservation if you set an alert. It's not a huge space, but the vibes are good with the low lightening and big picture windows into the WV. This is a spot you need to eat inside. The outdoor set up is a totally different vibe. Food: We had a group of 4 so we opted to order a few items and share. Things you must order include - stuffed garlic flatbread, lasagna for two (which is more like 4), amberjack crudo, sourdough pasta, and the stracchino gnocci. We also had the veal parm and it was good, but these other items knock it out of the park. Please, please, please don't go here without ordering the stuffed flatbread and lasagna! I didn't want to love the lasagna since it's so over hyped, but it was really good! The sourdough pasta was the other dish I was surprised with. It has a mezcal braise on the chicken that's really unique. If you've been considering Don Angie for a while, this is your sign to finally do it."

He said that's because of the sweet potato. If so shouldn't he explained me? I was upset and I talked with their manager and he said he understand and gave me $6 back. I felt sorry and thankful to the manager but not to the waiter at all. I was happy to find a good place in neighborhood but I'm not sure I will go again because of today's experience. I just want to emphasize the manager there is nice. But you have to be smart and alert when you order food to their sneaky waiter."

Portions are big. If you like burgers, they're great. They make great soups too. I love their chili. Their coffee is really good. They have a wide selection of beverages. I love their smoothies. They recently added a number of new selections to the menu. The prices are reasonable. The wait staff is generally very good. I enjoy sitting near the windows, so I can see activity going on in the street. The diner is very clean. Pets are welcome to sit with you at the table - just kidding LOL. Even with the COVID-19 pandemic, they can still get pretty busy for lunch. During weekends they're usually even busier."
2203,w_u28CgB2CL_8g_fm90eIg,6/13/2016,3 star rating,3.5 star review. When will yelp give decimals Decided it would be a good night to catch up with an old friend so i parked my car at her house and we took a walk to the diner.I decided to order the chicken prosciutto panini.  With side salad instead of friesThe panini was grilled but the negative is the salad dressing mustve ran all on the bottom so the panini was soggy on one layer of bread.  The salad shouldve been either in a separate dish or had the dressing on the side.... Overall i would return again but would opt for dressing on the side to avoid another soggy panini

BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY EVER.I ordered a medium well burger with cheese fries and while the burger was decent enough for me to put up with, their ""cheese fries"" left me disgusted. How are you going to charge us as much as you do for just literally throwing a blanket of cheese on fries and praying it melts. My girlfriend ordered a beef sandwich and it was comparable to SCHOOL FOOD. She couldn't even finish the first half of the sandwich because it tasted awful. Nothing could make our day better if we could get a refund for this so-called ""food."" Spend your money elsewhere."

They got brand new menus, new servers and bus boys.  The breakfast specials used to be $5.00 for French toast or pancakes with a cup of coffee on the new menu it's $7.00.  Want any breakfast meat ..its an additional 2.00.  Prices go up...I understand but 40% is ridiculous!  Now you figure with the higher prices the service would be better...but it's worst.  The server takes his time and never offer to refill the coffee.  I had to ask for each refill and the place was not busy.  It does not help that he never smiles and make me feel like I am bothering him when I ask.  What makes it worst is that they swapped the coffee cups and it's smaller!  The food is just ok and with the crappy service,  I think I will go elsewhere in the future."

My gf opened up her platter and she took one bite out of her sausage along with her bite came a long ass strand of blonde hair we were so damn disgusted that we threw all of the food out and just went to bed. I was so pissed because my food was so good but i had to throw it out . Thinking about it now is making me cringe i felt so bad for my girl because the shit had to go in her mouth smh.

If you call the manager they do hold your food for you to come all the way back and get what they forgot to put in. You would thing they would give you a free pie or something for the inconvience but nope. Thank god they have a popeyes and subway around now. We avoid this mcdonalds now.

2221,6Hkw54Mnce_Owa1_7YJlwQ,2/9/2023,1 star rating,"I expect much more of anything with the word museum attached to it. There is 1 room with the tiniest bit of history. I want to know more about the original machines, how things expanded, who decided to put it on a cone, who made the sugar cone, how is it made it various parts of the world. I'm a Chef and Baker, I make semifreddo so this is a topic I have passion for. This was 35min I'll never get back. This was ice cream around every corner, rooms with games, and nearly no history. Museum is literally defined as ""a building in which objects of historical, scientific, artistic, or cultural interest are stored and exhibited.""This place isn't that. At one point I took an elevator down, I reached an employee standing next to stairs going up and an elevator. He spoke no English WHAT!?!? I just came down, why was he telling me to go back up again? Ah yes because this place is a confusing maze of hell. This place makes no sense and was an epic mistake. Unless you have small children who you want to feed (I believe it was) 5 small ice creams to and let them play games, don't waste your time, money or energy."
2222,6Hkw54Mnce_Owa1_7YJlwQ,2/23/2023,3 star rating,"So I contemplated taking my kids here for a while until I finally gave in and took them this week. First of all to me personally, it's a lot of money for what it really is. Yes they do give you free ice cream, but honestly it's the least they can do! It's basically a walk around type thing... very bright and colorful. Nice photo ops.. but that's basically it. There are some activities for the kids but in my opinion if that's what you're looking for, you can take them elsewhere a bit more worth the $. Overall it's ok. No I wouldn't come again. But this is my personal opinion. YOU be the judge."

Everything was super cute and high quality. The employees working were amazing and so outgoing and fun (dancing and making jokes, etc.)  - which I think is hard to find these days - anddddd you get free, unlimited, icecream + popsicles! We were also surprised by how big this place was.. We took our time thinking there would be just a few different rooms, but ended up having to rush through the last room due to them closing soon. We went at night last minute and it was perfect because it wasn't as busy. We want to go to the one in Chicago now and see how it compares.. Highly recommend for kids or girls looking for insta-worthy photos!"

It was my first time attending and I always thought it was one of those places that people visit just for instagram and I will admit you will get many, many instagram worthy pics in their colorful rooms, but there is much more.If you take it seriously you will find a lot of cool historic facts about ice cream and get to look at nostalgic ice cream related memorabilia. I love going through all the different levels, interacting with the spaces and playing games. I tried many forms of ice cream and can say it was all amazing, definitely left in a sugar rush!Overall I think it is a very unique experience, fun for the whole family and I highly recommend going down the three story slide!"
2226,6Hkw54Mnce_Owa1_7YJlwQ,3/31/2023,5 star rating,"This place is less like a museum and more of a really fun, colorful place to have fun and take awesome pics. There is a small area where you get to learn about different types of ice cream around the world, and the history of ice cream posted on the walls, but that's about it.But I want to emphasize that I had a ton of fun here. Not just all the ice cream (which was good, but def have had better - their vegan options will surprise you at how tasty they are, though so don't sleep on it just because you think it's vegan it'll be bad), but there's multiple areas for you to have a blast There's a tunnel slide, a giant pool filled with plastic sprinkles with a slide to land you into the pool, an area with swings, whack-a-mole, cotton candy, ping pong and tons of places to sit and chill out and just appreciate the vibe. Lots of fun if you're ready to unleash your inner child a little bit.Would def recommend esp if you're not much of a regular museum person like myself."

Our daughter loved the the cotton candy game room...unlimited cotton candy! Why not?!But, keep in mind...if you're here just for cute photo ops, remember they're hella kids running around.

I'm an ice cream lover and I my favorite color is pink so everything about the Museum of Ice cream was perfect for me. Unlimited ice cream, sherbets, and popsicles were definitely my favorite parts about this experience. I loved the different rooms and the pool of sprinkles was so much fun. I went on a Friday afternoon around 4:30 and there wasn't any lines so it made my experience so much better! If you want to take pictures and videos, it is welcomed here and you definitely should. The staff was so friendly and helpful. They had no problems giving seconds and giving you instructions if you didn't know what was next.I can't wait to go again next year. I won't spoil any of the themes of the rooms but I will say the birthday cake ice cream and pineapple sherbet were the treats I had to get twice. Didn't really like the popsicles though."

One as a parent, and one as a kid.As a parent, I'd say try to go early to get those discount priced tickets. Plus, maybe you'd avoid more crowded times.As a parent, there's not much to do, and little in the way of education about ice cream. There's about 1 1/2 walls dedicated to the history of ice cream, but that's about it... and if you're with kids, they'll be pulling you to the next room to find the free ice cream.As a parent, there are several neat rooms to take pics in. Also - don't play with the bananas. There are signs, but we missed them. Just pointing it out.As a parent, you'll either be waiting to find the next ice cream spot, or waiting for your kid in the sprinkle pool. Or maybe you're an IG'er or TikToker who wants those pics? I dunno. That's not me.As a kid, there's free and unlimited ice cream. Have your fill.Sprinkle pool is fun for kids. Just be careful to take your shoes off...  and don't jump on kids already in the sprinkle pool.There's a big slide. Kids love to slide down it. The elevator for the parents (who don't slide down) takes time.Again... eat the ice cream. All the ice cream. Plus they have cotton candy there too. That's free.As a parent, my kids loved it. I wish we had gone when it was a little cheaper on the wallet, and less busy.... but they enjoyed it, so there it is."

My kiddo gobbled down all the ice creams with gusto but for me there was one ice cream out of the 4-5 that I liked. Besides the beginning introduction, the tour is self led. My kiddo loved  finale exhibit, the sprinkle pool as did everyone else it seems. People didn't want to leave this area and it got pretty packed. Considering we went at 11 AM on a very cold Friday in Feb, I was surprised how packed it was. Even when we first arrived, the line was out the door. Admission was free for one of us which made it worth it but if I had to pay $35+/per person I may have felt it was a bit overpriced."

My favorite has got to be the mofongo sliders, you get three on a plate & they are pretty good. The rotisserie chicken is so so, a bit on the dry side. The yellow rice and beans are on point always. Their salad is very fresh always. The skirt steak was decent, so was the grilled shrimp. The fact that they stay open till 2 am is a plus!

That's the legal TERMS in order to automatically add tip!  It's also law NOT to tax the gratuity, which they did. Apparently they charge u svs fee bc u are using your debit card. No where in the restaurant does it state this. So be aware!!! They'll hike up your bill if you don't question it. I got them to take the gratuity off, but they insisted on the svc fee.

The crust was extremely thin, everything tasted fresh and overall, it was a solid pie. The char from being baked in their brick oven added a nice slightly bitter aftertaste. Sprinkle on some dried chilis for additional flavor. Being that this location is in a food court, seating is pretty limited during peak hours.

The bee sting and Speckenwolf pizzas were covered in a generous amount of toppings. Unfortunately they just didn't hold up well from delivery and the texture was a bit off. Definitely try Roberta's if you've never been, but eat it fresh from the oven."

The only reason I'm giving this Roberta's location 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's located in a food hall with limited seating. If you're coming here with a group like I did seating is a crapshoot. Service here was fast and friendly. Prices are a bit higher than your average pizza but the quality here is outstanding. Make sure to order the garlic knots. They are $2 a piece but best $2 you will spend.

I feel like if you like garlic, you'd like this pizza. The bee sting was also damn delicious. Spicy and sweet... Although it's nothing crazy spicy. My friend, who cannot handle spice at all, was able to handle it. The honey on the pizza was interesting (in a good way).Anywho, I really love oven fired pizzas. Flavors on point. Prices pretty high (enough to where I'm glad I tried it but not coming back here again), seating in this location is pretty minimal since it's a food hall."

2274,YuzOnNDfRKixNJiaVy5Baw,7/20/2022,3 star rating,"I can't recommend or not recommend Sinigual, and I will give your the breakdown. This is long but bare with me! I've been to this Resturant more than a few times but always around 3:30 PM-4PM Mondays & Fridays when Mannie (or Manni, not sure of the correct spelling) doubles as a waiter & bartender. Now he makes those $5 margaritas DA BOMB!! They are soooo good and he gives excellent service. I always enjoyed my experience when he was my server/bartender. One time Mickey Mouse did pop out to say a brief hello than disappeared. I have never became sick so I think it's safe ... Food: guacamole: fair, it wasn't bad but not good enough for me to order it a second time. Chips & Salsa: it's free and the Smokey salsa is very good. $20 taco platter: it's good when you just get the steak & carnitas. The chicken is kinda dry.  Here is why I gave this Resturant only three stars; I went yesterday (on a Tuesday) at 5:30 PM (when Manni is long gone) and the service wasn't good. The waitress took chips & salsa off an empty table and gave it to me. How long was those chips there? With all that traffic in the Resturant that is gross. The margaritas wasn't good like it usually is. Barely any salt on the rim and it didn't have favor. My BEST experiences are when Manni is there. I would visit again when I know he is working (I know his schedule). You can't beat the happy hour prices in Midtown Manhattan but at the same time I'm still paying my money. It's up to you if you want to visit or not. Hope this helps!"

It's a super beautiful and huge restaurant, reminiscent of Maya Restaurant (they could possibly be brother/sister restaurants). The food and drinks are just okay. For the prices and the amount of food you get it's a wonderful deal. You will leave full. The frozen margarita was a bit on the sweet side. My best friend got his margarita on the rocks and I'm guessing it was good because he didn't say otherwise. Their happy hour is from 2 to 7 pm Monday through Friday, 12pm to 7 pm on Saturday, and all day on Sunday. The menu is as follows:$22 Sampler Platter: Chicken Taquitos, Blue Corn Skirt Steak Nachos, Cheese Quesadilla, Chipotle-Tamarind Barbecue Ribs, tomatillo-avocado and red pepper dipping sauces$20 8 Taco Platter (mix & match)Steak, Chicken or Carnitas.$20 Nacho Platter$5 House Margarita (frozen or rocks),  Well Drink, Draft Beer Pint or House WineThe only food worthy of speaking about from the $22 sampler platter are the chicken taquitos and the cheese quesadilla. The nachos and ribs were meh. The $20 taco platter was good. I got chicken and steak. My best friend got chicken and carnitas. We both had four tacos and they were filling. Next time I'll try the $20 nacho platter. Overall, a good spot for an everyday happy hour!"

We ordered tableside guacamole, chips,  and spicy margaritas to start. The guacamole was fresh and I always like when they make it tableside. The spicy margaritas were strong and had a good kick. I also ordered the shrimp diabla entree and the fruit flautas dessert. The shrimp was freshly grilled and I liked the achiote sauce. The fruit flautas was surprisingly not greasy and filled with fruit. Service was a bit lacking though, not very attentive and we had to ask for things multiple times even though we were a big group. The food was good though."

Additionally, I really enjoy that they are one of few restaurants that still give complimentary chips and salsa and both of their salsas are excellent. Sadly, after the amount of money I have spent here (and they are well over priced for what you get), I continue to receive not great service including that from the managers. I used to thoroughly enjoy this place and will continue periodically go to see if the service has improved, but I'm not hopeful. Luckily the Happy Hour prices make up for the lackluster service."

Some of us got there a little later and so we sat down order drinks and didn't take that long to order food. For starters they had tortillas on the table along with some butter and two different sauces. We ordered two guacamole and I ordered the shrimp Diablo. It was OK. The rice was pretty bland in the beans fact but the shrimp in sales were pretty good. Most of the food was semi lackluster. They didn't even walk around the table today bring the food stone at the end of dinner server ask if you wanted to third and I asked to see the menu and then he brought us a check instead of the deserving. I think it is hard to hear in there because it is fairly loud and that isn't an excuse for bad service. Walk around if you can't hear. Walk around to serve the plates. Asking us to pass them down was crazy. Maybe a drink but not a hot entree plate. Guacamole was probably the best thing I ate and even then it was a little too spicy. Definitely not a place I would go back to, like ever. We referred to it as an expensive Chili's and that it a great description."

We were given tortillas instead of chips and salsa and were a bit confused at first. We ordered one drink each (mojito and house margarita) and placed our food order. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and my friend ordered the steak nachos without the steak since she is vegetarian. The food came rather quickly, which leads us to believe that it was not made to order. Food was nothing to rave about. Presentation was mediocre, food was decent, but a bit on the pricey side. Ambiance is a bit loud, we had to speak loudly to hear each other even though we were sitting right in front of each other. Also no happy hour if you are sitting at a table, happy hour is only at the bar."

We were seated indoors, and we chose the more traditional on the floor experience, which was new for me. The service was all right. The food, on the other hand, was good but nothing to write home about. The spicy tuna roll comes with 6 pieces, and got the job done, although I can't help but want for those two extra pieces (is it that customary to serve 6 regular sized sushi pieces?). I thought the chicken Katsu Curry was delicious, although Rozena found the curry to be ordinary, with the Japanese style lacking (chicken Katsu has a specific look to it). The beef teriyaki was a bit disappointing, and felt rare/medium rare, even though I ordered medium. It was a bit disappointing -- maybe it wasn't their night, and I'd have to check in sometime again."

2286,YuzOnNDfRKixNJiaVy5Baw,3/26/2021,4 star rating,Walked past here on my way home on a nice sunny day. The special sign - Draft Asahi for $5 and cans for $3 caught my attention. I decided to sit down and give this place a try. I ordered some appetizers to share - gyoza and fried octopus. My favourite out of the two would be the gyoza. The octopus was a little bit on the oily side but it is fried after all. I also ordered an udon bowl which came with a variety of tempuras. These were also nice. The beers were reasonably priced so I stayed for a couple. I sat outside and soaked in the sun whilst enjoying my food and drink. Life is good.

I'd go back to try other dishes and hopefully with better experience & update this review."

2289,YuzOnNDfRKixNJiaVy5Baw,1/11/2022,4 star rating,Got the katsu curry and a spicy tuna roll for takeout. Great quality for the price. The curry is packed separately with the rice and the katsu to keep the crunch of the katsu and not soaking the rice too much. The curry is typical Japanese curry with some carrot and potato pieces. Exactly right amount of curry so you can finish it with the rice and katsu. The katsu has crunchy skin and flavorful inside. The spicy tuna roll is also well prepared with the right amount of sauce and spiciness. Would love to try dining in next time.

Best to come here with a group as they have good sharable plates and a nice drink menu. The bathrooms have Toto washlets, which is a bonus. The food here is just okay. The nabeyaki udon broth was too salty and the beef teriyaki didnt have enough flavor, both were too expensive for the quality. I liked the ika geso and the raw marinated wasabi, those were reasonably priced. Id recommend this place for the decor and casual dining experience."

The only disappointing thing about this experience was the way Giants played. Just very terrible!But this review isn't about the Giants! It about the amazing staff, a well priced brunch menu, and excellent service that we experienced at Woodbines. They have decent outdoor seating, but it was a relatively chilly Sunday afternoon, and we sat indoors on one of their comfortable seating opposite their bar.They had some good beers on draught, but we were in mood for some brunch cocktails and got an extremely sour Greyhound ($9) and Bellini ($9). The greyhound was quite sour and it felt like the grapefruit/concoction had gone bad. A very strong drink though! If you stick with the same cocktail, they had refills for $5 which I thought was pretty cool. I knew I should've started with their Bloody Mary ($9) which was a much better drink as compared to the Greyhound.For food, we got Avocado Toast ($15) and Beet Salad ($13) - both extremely flavorful and delicious options.Service was absolutely excellent and they have a very friendly team here! The place started getting busy around 3:15 pm. We will definitely visit again, but not when Giants are playing!"

The server was very attentive and food came out at a decent time.The food was flavorful & delicious. I recommend the beet salad and the short rib spring rolls! The meat was so tender and the cheese in the rolls complimented it. You will not regret ordering them! My boyfriend got the Classic and both the fries and the burger were really good.

I actually would prefer to message a owner, but I don't see an option for that. This review is based on our experience there today. We went there for brunch and our experience was almost completely overshadowed by the horribly rude waitress we had! I have been there many times and the staff has always been quite pleasant. But today there was a seemingly new woman there (blonde hair). It's almost like we were in a reality tv show and she was TRYING to be rude! Everyone was so taken back with her attitude. She must forget that she is working in customer service! I will never come back while she is working there. I really hope management addresses this. Because they WILL lose business over this woman.

We passed by a few spots but this one really caught our eyes when the waitress came out with this burger and what looked like a panini. We came inside and we're immediately seated. There were seats indoors and outdoors. The brunch menu had many options and we were excited to try them out. We ordered the Chicky and the Cubano. We also had the short rib egg rolls. The egg rolls were amazing. I also loved the Chicky. The Cubano however, was a little spicy. And not the spicy that makes your tongue burn but more so like wasabi, that makes your eyes water and your head hurt. If you like that kind of spicy, I would recommend but other than that, I just scrapped the Dijon mustard off my sandwich. I would definitely recommend this place and am definitely coming back for more! This is an Irish restaurant and I would love to try out new dishes to try."

Highly highly recommend the falafel hummus, it comes with two heavenly fluffy pita (both regular and whole wheat are good). I don't know what special ingredient they put in this dish vs other hummus places but it works.I also got the shakshuka, which was good with a nice kick (my only minor suggestion is to cook the egg a little longer, as the whites were a bit runny).Jonathan, our server, was super friendly. There is also a great backyard in the back with some heating. Again, don't miss this hummus if you're passing by."

While the inside of the restaurant is rather narrow, there is an outside area to eat as well. There are heat lamps located above the table we were at but it can only do so much work and didn't cover the whole table.As for brunch, we had to ask for recommendations because there were so many good things to order. Especially for my friend who is a vegetarian. We shared the whole wheat pita and falafel hummus + the cauliflower nuggets. I would definitely recommend the larger especially with the labneh, hummus and harissa on the side. The other option was alright but maybe we should have chosen something with more flavor like the garlic hummus or the mushroom one.While I took pictures of our entrees, I only tried the salmon croissant with poached eggs. If not for the harissa, it would be a croissant I could find at many other brunch places but it was good. If I had the flexibility in my stomach and wallet, I would want to try the sweet potato latkes or the Malawach for something more unique. However, I had a need for eggs that these dishes would not satisfy.I could come back and try the other dishes I mentioned plus the dinner menu."

The tables inside are spaced apart accordingly but there are not too many.  The seating in the back is actually quite nice and the covering does protect from elements such as rain. At one point I forgot I was outside.  I was greeted by a very enthusiastic and polite employee named Jonathan when I arrived.  He was packing orders to go as well as taking care of dine in customers.  All the staff, including the ones I saw prepping food were all wearing masks and taking proper safety precautions.  The menu is available online via their website or through a QR code on the tables.  I was originally planning to get a few things to try along with the hummus of course but they have such an extensive offering of things that I have never heard of or have not ordered in a while.  So I asked Jonathan for the best recommendations of dishes that represent Hummus Market.  He went above and beyond.  For the drink, I usually shy away from alcoholic beverages unless I am with a guest or friend.  Even though I was dining solo this time, the cocktail menu had some intriguing sounding items.  I decided on the ""Moroccan"" Spiced Gold Rush which consisted of bourbon, spiced honey, lemon and a cinnamon stick.  I drank it slowly as the food started arriving at the table but this would certainly be a good HH drink.  Now onto the food!  The first wave consisted of appetizers - Moroccan Cigars (mushroom, eggplant and cilantro ""spring rolls"" served with tahihi and harissa), Market Mezze 3 (you pick three items out of at least 6 or 7 choices for a set price) consisting of roasted cauliflower, falafel and lebnah along with pitas.  The cigars were quite unique and I think I ate those up pretty quickly.  The cauliflower and falafel I was familiar with but it was the first time I had heard of or seen labneh. It differs from the yogurt we are all familiar as it is thicker. It worked well as pita spread.  The next thing was their hummus, as you cannot go to a place called Hummus Market and not try their signature dish.  It was a platter consisting of garlic, tahini, mushroom and white.   The pita was definitely utilized for the hummus dipping.  For the main entree, Jonathan brought out the chicken schwarma, which was one of their most popular dishes.  The chicken fillet is on a bed of tahini and amba with peppers, cilantro and paprika oil.  I just stuck with the pitas instead of getting rice.  I finished this dish off as well.  So tasty but I would recommend to eat it quickly as the chicken tends to dry out fast.  You can dip in hummus or labneh as an option.  Another dish that he recommended was the Siniya, which is another one of their top dishes.  This one consists of roasted vegetables cooked in spicy tomato sauce and baked in tahini.  It is topped with warm chickpeas, mint cilantro and pine nut.  This is served with rice on the side. This is something I would have normally stayed away from but I am glad that it was recommended for me to try.  Very flavorful and a nice dish to have on a cold night.  Now for dessert. I was looking at that portion of the menu earlier out of habit. I was almost at my food limit.  It was decided that the classic baklava would be one choice (three modest sized pieces of flakey filo and crushed pistachio).  So very good.  I took some home with me for later.  The other dessert that caught my eye was the Chocolate truffles (walnuts and coconut flakes).  Jonathan informed me that all desserts were made in house. The chocolate was very rich.  As I write this review the memories of all the good food almost make me as sad as looking at an empty plate. My compliments to Mr Idan and his staff who prepared all the food and came out at one point to check on me and bring out the food.If you get a chance to travel to that part of Brooklyn, definitely check this place out."

We made a reservation for four and we're given the option to sit inside or outside. The backyard had heaters and blankets which was lovely. We started with some delicious drinks, there is no liquor but they do serve beer and wine and I had a soju hot toddy. For appetizers we started with the cauliflower nuggets and the hummus trio everything was incredibly fresh delicious and flavorful. For my entrée I had a salad with chicken Shawarma and I really enjoyed it. The service was the best part of the dining experience, Johnathan was amazing!!! I can't wait to come back here in the very near future."

When I have no place to go or dunno where to go, soju haus is always my go tos. My friend and I were there on a Monday night (around 10pm) and the restaurant was busy! We didn't need to wait for the table. We went there for drinks and ordered kimchi pancake to snack on. They have daily specials for pancakes as well. I highly recommend soju haus!Tip - cash or Amex only"
2312,Hp1ZDTeJOP1NrY2aFtROgQ,7/14/2022,3 star rating,"3.5 - First visit back after the pandemic - nice to see the food is still delicious and the vibe is still bumping!  This is a solid option for Korean food, best shared with friends! You absolutely have to share dishes, to try more and because the dishes (and drinks) are generally large-format.  You often see two people sharing just one or two dishes.  I love the soju cocktails and black raspberry wine.  Vegetarian options are very limited, but better than most Korean spots and you can make it work if you have some flexibility (eggs,etc.) - just be sure to ask for each dish whether it has meat, even if not listed in the menu description.  I love the spicy rice cakes and chive egg omelette roll - could eat those dishes every time.  Presentation is also fun!Can typically get a table without a reservation on a weekday, maybe with a short wait.  It has a bar-like atmosphere, so it is louder (in case you're sensitive to that). Service was just ok.  We got what we needed, but sat a long time before our order was taken, people seated well after us were served first, and no one really checked-in so we had to flag someone down when we wanted the check."

Like some baby fist balls. I can't remember everything we ordered, but I did not have a bad dish here.It is a bit pricey, compared to Koreatown in LA...but still not terrible.One thing though...they only take cash or AmEx. I do believe they have an ATM there, but it could also be the soju goggles seeing things. Still, the hottest place to be on a Friday night imo. Oh!

We made reservations for 3 people on a Wednesday night but was told there were no seats available and that we'd have to wait till a table opens up. Perfectly fine but wished they honored our reservation beforehand. Prices are on the pricier end which is expected for the location.

It was really the perfect amount of food for all of us. We also got 2 songs to share (green grape is the best). I think the spicy chicken stew was quite bland, but the braised pork ribs and the jokbal were good. Overall this place is definitely best for the vibes. Fun place to bring some friends"

The waiters here seem to be always hustling and busy, which usually is the case especially on the weekends that I came. There usually is at least a 30 minute wait to get seated, and all your party has to be present. The cocktails are refreshing but they give me the impression of detox waters. It really is a hit or a miss. NOTE: they only take CASH or AMEX. So come prepared."

It's located upstairs on the 2nd floor so be sure to look up when Google Maps seems to be telling you that you have arrived at your destination... (Coming from somebody who walked past it like 3x :D )The place was packed on a late Friday evening, we were lucky that there was no wait for walk-ins. They offer a wide selection on both the drink menu and food menu, but I think their main selling point is the atmosphere. It's lively, well-lit, and reminiscent of the type of bars you find in Asia. They even serve barley tea! Definitely lots of chatter and background noise, but in an energizing and not overwhelming sort of way. We came mainly for the spirits but would love to try out more of their food selection sometime. (Note: every table has to order a food dish.)"

The price is high for chinese food, but decent for the area. I would recommend if you like chinese food but dont want to go to China town."

2323,wfGFM8zvdw9Zs-jxsTdjww,6/18/2018,4 star rating,"I had eaten at Taste Kitchen on 36th, right next to Abaya Thai, and had tried the lunch special. The lunch specials are all served with a choice of hot & sour soup, egg drop soup, egg roll or cheese wonton, I selected the egg drop soup which was solid. For the meal I chose #L2. fish fillet with black bean sauce, it was very good and tasted fresh, with a decent portion of about five slices of fish. The green tea ice cream however, was not enjoyable, and for $3.95 I recommend passing on this dessert, thankfully the fortune cookie made me feel better and remember how good the food was. My standard for good green tea ice cream is a creamy and consistent texture where the taste comes through, this one was very icy and poorly prepared. The waitress and manager did a very good job and were efficient and friendly, I removed one star from the rating for the dessert but otherwise I would give this place a perfect score. I read several bad reviews of Taste Kitchen, one of which was written by a ""Mike R.,"" talking about the poor service, specifically about the delivery man. Mike mentioned ordering the food, checking the order upon arrival to ensure everything was there, and mentioning that they forgot the soda. Once he told the delivery driver this, the driver was yelling and screaming, telling this customer ""call the boss!"" He returned with the coke even angrier, yelling about the time and pointing at his watch. As a delivery man, this type of behavior is highly unacceptable and the fact that there are multiple reviews describing the same type of behavior is not good for business. The management as well issued a very bad apology to the customer ""Melissa B.,"" who mentioned the same type of angry, yelling behavior from (presumably the same) delivery man. ""Qin L."" who answered as a representative of management essentially made excuses for his poor behavior saying he was busy and backed up, implying that the customer should be aware of this and expect to wait longer than they were told they would wait as well as deal with unpleasant and mean behavior, which is again unacceptable as well as highly unprofessional on management's behalf. The problem is a lack of communication and code of conduct enforcement between management. Management should have all employees understand proper behavior and etiquette to ensure workers do not treat workers impolitely and unprofessionally (as this leads to bad business/lost customers) and should further ensure that at least one employee at all times of service speaks or at leasts understands fluent enough English to be able to meet all order instructions and to communicate between customers and delivery workers. If they followed these guidelines, I believe they would have at least a 4 1/2 star rating, rather than their current 3 1/2 stars."

For lunch, I was able to get a solid amount of fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, and cheese wontons for less than $10!

Called me yelling non stop (as I was trying to come downstairs to let him in...my office doesn't allow them to come up to floor 12). When I got to him he was still yelling incoherently. He kept lifting his hand like he might hit me, or something. Also, I just discovered a voicemail from him in which he is literally just cussing. At no nothing specifically. Very scary and strange. Coworkers of mine also saw the incident and said they were about to step in before I went back inside.I hope this man gets the help he needs. However, it's unsafe to send someone like that out on deliveries, which is why I am leaving 1 star. My best to the team at taste kitchen. They seem to otherwise have great reviews.

You know those tiny pieces of unidentifiable fried garbage that you get in between bites when you order GT's?  NONE of that here.  The large wontons in the soup I ordered were delicious as well-not very much meat, but the quality of the noodle made up for it. The staff was also very friendly and went the extra mile.    Please don't bore me with agonizing over the identity of your ""authentic vs. inauthentic"" Chinese cuisine.

The olives had pits and were delicious and Briny. I really loved how creamy and fresh the feta tasted, and I liked the olive oil with oregano drizzled on top. I usually hate dessert wines but the one that they had in the flight was really good. It tasted like all the best flavors of a raisin.

Solid drinks (they had the brunch classics like mimosas, bellinis, and bloody Marys, and even Pimm's cups) for OK prices: around $13, which isn't bad for brunch in the area. The food was average. The avocado toast ($15) was generously piled with avocado, although it could have used some seasoning (even just salt/pepper). The pancakes ($17) were delicious. The vanilla butter was great, and the pancakes were the perfect texture. The Eggs Benedict Swiss ($22) again lacked flavor and wasn't a great value.

Came for dinner tonight with a reservation, booked many days in advance when the website indicated plenty of availability, but were sat outside. Fine, they were busy, but we didn't appreciate the host condescendingly exaggerating that the inside tables were booked ""months in advance"" as an explanation. We had cocktails and an appetizer and then ordered fondue for the meal. We waited a very long time for the fondue, and when it came, it was extremely disappointing. The cheese was very watery and thin and extremely salty. They served it with a basket of nearly stale bread and assorted vegetables and fruit, which including boiled potatoes that were almost completely cold. It was a disappointing meal, but after our check was delivered and our server acknowledged that we were ready to pay, we waited another half hour before they came back to settle our bill. At some point during this period, we went inside to check about paying and were rudely turned away by the host. Eventually she came out and charged our card. As we were getting up to leave and gathering our things, at one point the host tapped me on the shoulder, held the curtain open and gestured for me to exit, as if we weren't leaving fast enough.In brief, extremely rude staff and mediocre food. Won't be coming here again."

We first found this venue when my mother and I were aimlessly looking for an Italian venue to get dinner before catching our train at Grand Central. The experience was phenomenal. Fast forward a few years and we scoured Midtown looking for this restaurant, finally successful in our search. The food was delicious and the servers were very accommodating. I ordered a 2nd glass of campagne, which they forget, but upon realizing their mistake our server offered my mother, her boyfriend, and me three complimentary glasses to make up for it. Very, VERY, kind establishment. ALSO they had live music with a piano player."

It's a very romantic place, so it's a great spot for a date. We started off with the baked clams and the burrata to share. Both were delicious, and they even split up the baked clams onto 2 plates for us so it'd be easier to eat. As a main entree, I got the eggplant parm, which is one of my favorite italian dishes. They did a great job making this, and I even had some leftover for lunch the next day. We also split the chocolate mousse for dessert. I'm not a huge chocolate mousse fan, but this one was actually so good because it wasn't too heavy. And of course we had to get some drinks, so I got a margarita and then a french martini. Both were very refreshing, but the martini was amazing. A little on the strong side, but it tasted so good. Aside from the food, the service was great, and our waiter was happy to give us recommendations of what to get."

The dining room is a vast room that has more space a couple of steps down into another area.  The ceiling is low and plays tricks with the noise and conversation in the place.  I could clear as day here one table word for word that was several feet away on the diagonal but not the one next to me.I went crazy with my ordering... the fettuccine Alfredo- go figure"

Our meal was excellent.  I had a glass of wine, with the Tri Colored Salad to start and she had a big bowl of chicken soup.  She ordered a Sprite that was served in a wine glass.  Fancy.  She had the Pesto Linguine and I had the Chicken Florentine.  Both were wonderful entrees (I tasted hers too).  For dessert, I had the cannoli, and she had the ice cream dish which was pretty unique.  It was like they took a big ball of ice cream, rolled in chocolate and froze again.  It was then sliced for plating, and served with whipped cream and strawberries.  The slices looked like sliced apples.  It tasted so good.  The couple at the next table saw ours and ordered their own.The service was perfection."

2357,--FoSeUBHQb_p6iTntY4KA,4/25/2022,5 star rating,I was a little skeptical going to this restaurant because the prices are higher than I am used to paying for Italian food. But it was the only Italian place within walking distance that had good reviews and reservations available so we decided to try it.The restaurant has been around for awhile and it shows in the decor. The place is a bit dark and when I saw one of the wall lamps askew I was a bit concerned about what we were getting.The service is attentive and polite. At first I had some difficulty understanding the NY Italian accent but they were patient in communicating with me. As the meal continued their friendliness was quite apparent. I appreciated how even though the waiter took our order without writing it down they still served the dishes to the people who ordered them. They kept checking in and even brushed off the crumbs before dessert.The food itself was quite good. The pasta was obviously made in house and the sauces were delicious.Though this was the most expensive meal we had during our Manhattan trip I would say it was worth it.

Mid Level Italian.  There are probably 250 restaurants just like this in NYC.  Not a bad thing.  Good sturdy Italian, with good service, nice people.  It's not hip, it's not great, decor hasn't probably changed in 25 years, decent but nothing exciting wine list.  So what I mean is you can probably walk down any street in Manhattan and find a restaurant like this, serviceable, reliable, not gonna knock your socks off but probably always a decent meal.  Csr Salad was pretty lame; underdressed, if you can believe that, small and not much flavor.  Buffalo Mozzarella, again medicore, not much style or substance.  Entrees were better, but again good, not great."

The food took awhile to come out, even though only a few tables were occupied. Our waitress messed up our order and brought out beef pan fried noodle, so they had to take it back to make us the correct food that we had ordered. Service otherwise was fine, and we had a good experience here. I'm not sure if I'd be back though, but the string beans were great!"

Scallion pancake was a bit oily but really good in their dipping sauce (vinegar I think). AND THE SPARE RIBS. This place is called pig heaven for a reason; they don't play!! We were so happy after this meal, which was extra yummy after biking up and down the city. Also their service was sublime; they were really friendly and let us sit outside so we could watch out bikes (despite there being no one else outside), and they were really attentive in general. Such a pleasant experience, thanks pig heaven!"

Fish fry is all done under the hood at the dining room counter, kitchen in the back cooks everything else. The food was really good. Service was fine. Dining room was a good size. Soup was yum. I'm sure it's mobbed in the Summertime. Loved that everything came out hot and fresh. The spicy sauce had a smoky taste to it, maybe chipotle?  I liked it. Heat level was good.

The mussels had no flavor and the broth they were in tasted like an oily oregano water and literally nothing else. I had to sprinkle salt on each one I ate. The calamari was nice and crispy and not over cooked at all which is great but the breading AND the marinara had absolutely no seasoning at all and once again had to add the salt myself. The waitress also never brought the lemon for the dish even though she kept saying she would.The lobster bisque had literally no lobster in it at all and tasted like bland heavy cream and boiled potatoes. Again, had to add a good amount of salt and pepper to make it bearable. Our waitress was very sweet and I really enjoyed her but waited a long time just for her to bring a soda. Also, at $3 a soda you'd think you'd get a regular can but it's a mini bottle instead so they're definitely price gouging there a bit. Overall the takeaway was that the literally do not season any of their food so be prepared to salt and pepper to everything."

Served with house marinara- yes.Cherry stones- as plump, clean chewy as id remembered. A bit salty, inherently. Oysters- they are fresh and clean tasting but not huge as we'd hoped. Some pieces were flimsy. There was nothing too memorable about this dozen only that they are a premium cost here. $30 per dozen."

This is a classic old-time Italian place where everybody knows the restaurant's name. Thank God no one knows everybody's name. Cheers to that!We had a waitress named Grace. She was all right. We decided to go to steamers, baked clams, and a seafood combo. Everything was perfect. The seafood was fried seafood covered with tomato sauce. Steamers were excellent, juicy, and sweet. After all that, we tried to take some seafood pasta with tomato sauce to go, but the waitress said they couldn't make it that way because they have a different sauce they put on top of the pasta. This is a sauce they pour on top, not cook with it. So we passed on that takeout.Try this once in your lifetime, and you're all set!"
2380,o2SAcKbfOMkA71xUfyee6Q,8/23/2021,3 star rating,"It's one of those local places you come to for a decent meal, not amazing not bad. I was feeling seafood and my friend was treating so had to find a decently affordable place with a ton of options. My friend eats a lot so it needed to be worth his money too. The guy at the counter recommended the shrimp fra divola. We ordered the littleneck clams, shrimp fra divola pasta (came with actual clams and shrimp) and a clam linguine (just chopped up clams) pasta. The little necks were good, but 6 for $10 is sorta pricey, but oh well I wanted clams. The pasta dishes took a bit to come but not a ridiculously long time. We also asked for additional plates since we were sharing. I think the shrimp fra divola dish was better than the clam linguine, but my friend preferred the clam linguine. I preferred the shrimp pasta because it was a tad spicy and had more flavor, but my friend thinks the sauce was too salty and overpowered the dish, so he preferred the clam linguine. The clam linguine was a bit plain for me, but not bad. Service at the counter was also pretty good. My friend remarked that he enjoyed his time here (unprompted) so yeah I guess overall would recommend it for a casual catch up with a friend and dinner with family."

Let me tell you that it is worthy of being on that show. Holy cow it was great. The entire dinner was phenomenal. The service was perfection too. I could not have asked for a better meal."

2383,sfsjk1h50ooC2ioY7m48gw,5/1/2022,4 star rating,"This is an excellent restaurant for pre-show eats.  I ate here on a Saturday before a matinee.  The service was a Prix Fixe menu designed for eating before a theatre show.  The cost was $42 and included three courses.  Since this was a weekend, there were brunch options which could be substituted for the main course.  I chose Seafood Bisque, Trout Almondine, and Peach Melba for my courses.  I did add wine to my meal which was not included in the predetermined price. The food was delicious and well worth the cost for the three course meal.  The service was exception.  I typically measure service by how many times the wait staff checks on me during the meal and how fast they remove the empty plates from the table.  Le Rivage met all of my standards.  Someone checked on me several times to make sure I did not require anything.  Items I requested were promptly delivered to the table.  Empty plates were promptly removed once I had finished the dish.  Thanks, this exceptional service was greatly appreciated.My reason for choosing this restaurant was two fold.  Firstly, someone tagged it on social media which brought it to my attention.  Secondly, the location was perfect for a theatre visit.  Most of the main theatres are only a few blocks from the restaurant.  Perfect if you find yourself in a position where you are late leaving lunch or dinner and need to hurry to the theatre."

Thank goodness we came early. Everything from the table paper to  the bathroom was exceedingly clean and staff wore masks.The appetizers were definitely the high point of the meal. The escargot and Seafood crêpes were perfectly seasoned and creamy, better than any we have ever had.The main dishes were OK. We were excited about the award-winning french onion soup burger. In reality, the French onion flavor was mild; we would have expected a bit more seasoned onion as part of it. The mussels were also OK. The mussel broth had a very gardeny flavor, with notes of sweet pepper and tomato, not quite what we were expecting but interesting. We had better mussels at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant in Las Vegas.Dessert saved the show. The mousse and crème brûlée were fantastically creamy with just the right amount of sweetness.We loved the ambience, and the cost was on par with other good restaurants in the area.

It has become my and my friend's pre-Broadway show spot as it's so close to the theatres, generally has quick service (was a little slow last night but usually better), and has great food. Almost all dishes knock it out of the park, and the menu is so extensive we want to keep going back to try more!It's not perfect - I'd say 4.5 is the most appropriate here because there has been a miss, but I'm happy to round up because regardless my experience have been great. Here are the things I've had that are excellent:Apps:1) The escargot here is fabulous 2) The seafood bisque is delicious 3) The frog legs are delicious You can't go wrong with either 3!Entrees:It's really hard to pick between the French Onion Soup Burger and the Croque Madame. Both are delicious and so cheesy and meaty and delicious. My friend got the Steak Frites and loved them, but said the Mussels were a little over cooked another time so to not get those. Desserts:Love the Chocolate Mousse and the Peach Melba. The crème brûlée however was the biggest miss here - came out with a hot/warm pudding which is supposed to be chilled with the burnt top. Wasn't great and wouldn't get it again. But that peach Melba is fire. The service is always so friendly. I speak French and felt like practicing with one of the staff and they ended sending a lady over who I believe was the general manager and we spoke French for quite some time. Loved it, she was so sweet! The service is also almost always very fast - we go at 5:30 when we have a 7pm show. Last night was slower than usual but we still got out at 6:45 and made it to our show. For some reason our dessert took a while but they also were very busy. They have heated outdoor seating but if I can make a recommendation it could be a little more ventilated with Covid - it's one of those outdoor spaces that's pretty enclosed so we 1) didn't even need the heaters but 2) were still a little Covid nervous. There's a big red curtain that they should just make sure to leave open cause at this point if you're choosing to dine outdoors, it's cause you're trying to be extra safe. Will definitely return!"

It must have been a total of fifty dollars for two normal sized pizzas and two cokes. They don't offer caffeine free which is another issue. Save your money there are tons of pizza places around.

2398,rlp1_EyRynmIDlJClhRNlQ,3/8/2022,3 star rating,"Artistic Pizza is a tiny pizzeria on West Third, close to Sixth Avenue. there are a few seats by the window. the space is fairly clean and organized. there are a variety of pies on display. there's not a lot of interior space, so most people grab n go. there's a small fridge filled with soft drinks. the pizza here is kinda average--not bad, not great. Artistic Pizza basically feeds NYU students, drunken bar goers, and hungry folks looking for a bite. went here two different times--got a plain slice the first time. the plain slice is okay/good, doesn't travel well, the sauce errs on the sweet side, it's covered in melty mozzarella, and the the crust is airy and soft (no crispness). the second time, i got a Margherita slice--sauce is fairly sweet, the blobs of mozzarella were soft and melty, the crust was airy and had a a little crispness to it. the slices are cut kinda small imo. didn't mind the smaller size on the plain slice bc it is a $2 + tip but the Margherita is like $4.50 + tip for a pretty small piece. maybe they make smaller pies but they don't seem to be the normal 18"" NYc pies. the other issue is i don't think the pizza oven gets hot enough bc even when the slice are reheated there is no crisp firmness to the crust. the staff is really nice and friendly. i wished the pizza was better bc their upbeat-ness warrants 4 stars. drops mic cuz not all pizza is created equali outzzz"

I ordered Shrimp Parmigiana w/ penne pasta and Fried Calamari and it was delicious. The pasta and sauce was fresh, while the shrimp was cooked to perfection and very cheesy. Not many places can make this well. The fried calamari was real calamari, which was very meaty and not over cooked. I also ordered zepoles for a snack they were also good. I can't wait to order again, and I'm very picky."

Garlic knots: Just tasted of stale dry bread! I think prison bread would be better. Brushetta: the most disgusting thing.... Wouldn't even feed it to my dog! The bread was completely soggy.. and the tomatoes were saturated with a sour nasty tasting brownish sauce. Bleeeekh I'm cringing just remembering the nightmare!!Artichoke Slice: Artichokes were straight out of a can and tasted preserved and that preserved can taste overpowered everything else... of course I spent my money on a restaurant to have that wonderful can food flavor.. yummVege Lasagna: full of veges which is a good thing, but it was completely bland and blah. It might be soo blah, it could be the cure for insomnia. Fettuccine Alfredo: So bland I had to use my pantry to make it edible. After a lot of doctoring this was the only thing I actually ate thank god for my saving seasoning. Lord help me, this was a brobdingnagian disappointment. Save your self!

Trappizzinos:Oxtail: this came highly recommended. I expected to be blown out of my mind because of how many people have raved about it. Alas. No. It's good, but not mind blowing abs an okay size for $8. Eggplant: my friend liked this, $8 Suppli: $4 each or 3 for $11Cacio e pepe: woah. I know it's fried and cheesy, but wow was this heavy in a oooof too much I feel gross after eating type of way Seasonal special: leek and taleggio. Good! Leek flavor is very mild, hardly existent.

I had done some advance research and knew I wanted to try Trapizzino. We walked in and lucked into two seats at their bar counter. The gentleman working behind the counter was great! Very proud of their food and ready to point us in the right direction. I knew from looking at Yelp that I wanted a bitter greens Trapizzino and he recommended we add the ox tail Trapizzino. We rounded it out with the chickpea and green olives salad. The chickpea and green olive salad landed first and it was delicious! So vibrant! A bit of a briny kick from capers and a subtle creaminess from an olive oil based dressing. A great start. The Trapizzinos arrived and we shared both. Not the easiest to cut and once we tried them, we realized that we could have done two of our own. That's because they were so damn tasty! The mixed bitter greens delivered in the flavor department. The ox tail ragu was also bringing the flavor and had lovely texture.After seven courses at a nearby Michelin starred restaurant, Trapizzino provided us our best bites of the evening! Well worth a return!"

The restaurant is really charming, on a corner street in the LES, and the food is just as good as the ambience. I got the kale salad, and eggplant trapizzino and my friend got the stewed oxtail trapizzino. Everything was really savory and satisfying. The kale salad was really creamy and crunchy, yet light. It was a nice contrast to the warm saucey trapizzino. They have great meat and vegetarian options, and I personally think the perfect lunch is sharing a salad and getting one trapizzino for yourself. I can't wait to come back and try more trapizzino flavors! It doesn't hurt that each trapizzino is $8.50 either!"

The chicken was alright but a little harder to eat in bigger pieces. Bread in the pizza pockets is more like a focaccia and soft and airy than like a pizza"

The bread was soft on the inside, crisp on the outside... absolute perfection. The flavors that were packed into this pocket were heavenly. The burrata in the zucchini trapizzini was creamy and delicious and you cannot go wrong with the eggplant and parm combination. We had these with a side of the suppli, which was delish. Slightly disappointed that we didn't order seconds lol. The service was great - our waiter was so patient with us and allowed us to enjoy our drinks leisurely.

The manager answered honestly and said they had made a real burger by mistake and that they would send a beyond burger to replace. Mortified I had been munching on meat, I wanted some empathy and understanding from the manager who was unable to see why a vegetarian eating meat was such a big deal.  She grew irate and eventually hung up the phone without understanding why their mistake was worse than just sending the wrong item. Vegetarians - it's hard to tell the difference between beyond burgers and real meat. If you find yourself halfway through a burger thinking ""something's not quite right"" well, I feel your pain."

It's a little bit on the pricey side, but I'm not complaining. The food took about five minutes to be ready and it was piping hot. The chicken had good flavor and I got the hot buffalo sauce on the side. I would recommended this because my coworker didn't, and his was a sloppy mess and overly hot. Mix the hot buffalo sauce with blue cheese, and you have yourself a great dipping sauce.Limited seating inside, so be prepared to take back to the office and wait for seating.

Got a delivery order of ""New Yorker"" flavored wings, chicken cheesesteak, and a side of mac. Yikes. Let's go one by one. The cheesesteak was a hot mess. Piles of lettuce and bread with a small strips of chicken drenched in sauce. The onions were cooked well, but it was so, so much bread I felt like I was eating nothing but carbs and lettuce. The bottom bun got soggy by the time the food got here, and the cheese was completely unmelted despite the sandwich being warm. There were definitely some assembly problems because I could barely keep the sandwich together a quarter way through eating it because the paper and buns were absolutely drenched. It fell apart faster than my expectations. The mac and cheese was indescribable. And not like ""this is so good there are no words to describe this."" It was more like ""this taste like nothing, that are literally no applicable words"" - but I'll try my best. Very, very soft noodles (borderline mushy) with cheese binding it all together. But it tasted like absolute nothing. Like open your mouth right now and close it - that's what it tasted like. There seemed to be no seasoning, no cheese flavor, nothing. I have had tap water that had more layers of flavor. In low spirits, I finally got to the wings. And remember this is from ""Best Wingers"" - a place that is so confident about its wings it used a superlative. And? They were medicore. Not terrible - not enough to change their name to ""Worst Wingers"", but not good. They were the kind of wings you'd expect from a corner pizza place. The chicken was hot and crispy, but dry and flavorless. It was like biting into a bad biscuit. And there was no redemption in the sauce either. The New Yorker sauce can only be described as discount Frank's Buffalo Sauce but with an extra accidental hit of vinegar. Overall, an easy do-not-return kind of joint. Maybe I'll try the place that's called ""Decent but not great Wingers"" next time"

Buffalo sauce was spicy and no joke here. Much cold drinks was needed after. Garlic Parmesan is my favorite sauce here, it is a nice combination of the two flavors. Barbecue was more on the boring side but okay. Buttermilk Chicken Tenders, they were a bit on a hard side and boring but the side sauces make it better. It's decent quality and could be better.Sides - mashed potatoes, potato wedges, and Spicy Pickles. All were once again pretty decent and goes well with the chicken."

If you want more product in a store serviced by the owner, don't be a push over... make them give you the right amount.  I ask every single time I think it's too light and at this point they sort of laugh, but they always take care of it.  I like them, I don't want to drive to Hillside and I have no complaints since I don't take shit to begin with.

Maybe one last summer and they are trying to wring the last penny out of the place?  How can you be grumpy selling ice cream?  People love going in your store and you can't even try to speak to them.  No response to thank you--forget responding to have a nice day.  So disappointed that they are ruining the experience for the next generation.  Hire some young folks, run some sales to get rid of the old, unappealing cones and bonnets, and at least try to pick your head up.  Tried to be patient and have compassion but diluted products at prices nearly double the competition, I just wonder why they try to keep the business?"

Although the atmosphere is dated, I like it as it is a reminder of old New York. This location hosts guests of old money who live in the neighborhood, and it's nice to see the staff interact with the regulars. However, if you are not a regular then you don't get great service. I was there probably for an hour before I began to get okay service. And it's not like the bar was crazy busy. The main bartender seemed stressed out. He didn't offer me water, a menu, or follow up about my drink. I had to flag him down for everything. And unfortunately, all of the drinks I ordered were sub par and extremely overpriced for what they were. I don't mind paying $16-25 on a drink, but if I do - I want it to be good. These drinks were awful. I certainly wouldn't waste money here again. I get it's a scene, but why?"

I think he may have had a difficult day, which is understandable, but you shouldn't let all the people eating at your restaurant see that. It felt a bit strange for such an upscale place to have such cold service (I was expecting more attentiveness as well)Food: My group had Penne alla puttanesca, Mozzarella di Bufala, 2 different cake flavors, grilled branzino and baked eggplant alla parmigiana. I think the food tasted fine, not the best I've had. Serving size could've been more for the price you are paying.  Overall: food tasted fine, but the service really prevents me from wanting to ever go back here."

She didn't even offer a solution! Heck no! I called and barked right back at her and then asked is she even going to do anything about this? The meal that was missing was for my 3 year old and she continued to yell again ""okay fine but next time just call me! What do you want? Food? Refund? Sodas?""

Their fresh baked rolls are insane. Any sandwich here is elevated because the bread is so good. I tried the cookies in the display case and they weren't anything I would try again. The cookie tasted a little stale and it did not represent the quality of their products.

Besides that, their food is overpriced, they close before the time posted on the door, almost $10 for a sandwich even if it's on a roll instead of a hero, I saw a dead fly next to a cookie I was going to buy,  they don't accept debit or credit and their staff smoke more than a chimney.

I usually walk past because it often takes 20 minutes just to get a sandwich. I saw the sausage and pepper hero special and ordered it. True to form, 20 minutes later I cashed out and left. I got to work and unwrapped the hero. The bread was so soggy I couldn't even bite into it. I then opened the sandwich and  saw only sauteed onions on the surface. I pulled them out and collected a whole onion. There were a few strips of red and green peppers and half of a cut up sweet italian sausage. This onion sandwich cost $8.00.

I ordered the chicken cutlet special on a hero, which should have been chicken cutlet, fress mozz, peppers on garlic bread. When I finally got to open my sandwich on the ferry back, it was chicken cutlet on bread, nothing else. I was severely disappointed not only that they got my order wrong, but they had the gaul to actually serve a chicken cutlet on a hero with nothing else and call it a special. For shame."

I initially wanted to buy their vanilla roll cake which they have for $11 but I buy from another asian bakery for $6. So, instead I bought a few muffins, a corn bun, a curry pocket, and a coconut raisin bread. I don't know why  they put nuts in it but I do like the muffins. Their corn pastry I enjoyed the corn part but the pastry part was a little dry. I also thought the curry pocket was dry as well. It was also super flaky and the curry part inside I thought could have had more flavor. All together the price for everything was about $10.50.

If I remember correctly, this location has a public sink and since this place is used for carryout, I'm more lenient about the lack of a restroom.  I like the assortment of sandwiches and pastries the bakery has to offer. The staff is efficient and the registers actually show you the total price. It's easy to calculate beforehand, in line, because there is no tax (and there shouldn't be as long as this place remains cash only). My favorite pastries from here are the egg custard tarts and the custard filled sweet breads. The sandwiches are maybe 3"" in length, but their bread is so much better than that of a nearby ""competitor."" One sandwich costs around 2.25 to 2.95, depending on which kind.So, the food is great. The atmosphere is okay. The staff have to accept pennies more often, since they are cash only. It does help that the prices of the goods are nice round numbers.-1 for cash only policy"

The ladies who work there are also very sweet, however they don't speak English well. That's just about all the good things I can say about this place though. Although I do like their assortment of pastries and bakery goods, I constantly see the shelves EMPTY or with barely anything left. The egg custards have been in that rotating heat thing for so long I always see that the aluminum cup which holds the custard is BURNT to the paper. None of their drinks are made consistently despite having the same order (3) times a week for almost a year and a half now. Some days there will be too much sugar, some days not enough. There are also some breads that you have to order behind the counter, for example the lotus leaf wrap that comes to a whopping $3!! It use to be $2.50 and larger, but now it is $3 and smaller. This is also a hit or miss, sometimes there's a lot of meat and sometimes there's none at all. I also enjoy getting the ""rice roll"" but they always seem to be OUT of this or it's not ready to be sold since it hasn't heated enoughCAN YOU GUYS PLEASE REPLENISH YOUR INVENTORY!?!?!?"

The accompanying penne pasta was lack-luster. Simple paste tossed with tomato sauce (no salt, just sour taste).Although the food was edible, it def isn't something I would find myself craving for."

2514,lQ7H-COT5duZQQ0XqGFPDg,10/30/2022,1 star rating,"This establishment does not in anyway respect people of color. The picture is of RIGATONI TRE PORCELLINI (PANCETTA, SAUSAGE, PROSCIUTTO) price $19 plus tax $20.40. I asked at the window for my meal; immediately after he asked ""is that all"" he then shoved the ApplePay in front of me. It had no information highlighted, so I asked the price. My response came with a huff and puff ""what does the menu say?""  I paid and stepped away from the window and stood by the outdoor tables. Let me back up a bit. While I was waiting to order a young man was ordering and paying for his order with a bit of a hard time from the same person taking orders. I observed and placed my order with minimal but still a bit of rudeness. Back to me standing waiting for my order. It had taken a longer moment then I expected, so I took a sit. The young man and his date (a very pretty young woman) were sitting at the next table waiting for their order. Their order came and they opened it and began to eat. Suddenly another person went over to their table and said "" I asked you if it was to stay or to go, you told me to go. If you were going to stay you should have said so this way we would have wasted the plastic for your food"".  With a sign of maturity and grace the young man responded quietly. His response was met with an even louder reprimand. The young ignored the second reprimand and continued eating. By this time my meal had been packed and ready. I noticed the package was rather on the light side but I took it and left. Upon opening I discovered what is pictured for $20.40 the container was not full. Sadly, I did notice a completely different approach by the staff to lesser melanin-like customers. But it is very well possible I am in a sensitive place (doubt it but all things are possible).I am so disappointed in the treatment of the young man and the lack of portion of my meal. Did I mention there were no utensils nor napkins given, just a bag with the half filled pasta dish and a bag of bread?NO STARS AND I WILL NOT CALL THE SPADE A SPADE, needless to say I will never return or recommend Pepe Rosso. Yelp please REMOVE this star, not being able to post unless one is chosen hurts the reviewer. Try adding positive and negative signs, just a suggestion."

I had the penne vodka which lacked flavour and cheese. Service was also very slow. At least the location was good!
2516,lQ7H-COT5duZQQ0XqGFPDg,11/27/2022,3 star rating,Sorry to be so honest since the owner seemed to be very attentive and polite. But the food was not to good. I got the meatball spaghetti. Meatballs were not good at all.
2517,lQ7H-COT5duZQQ0XqGFPDg,10/12/2021,3 star rating,"I've been a huge fan of this place for a while, but I'm extremely sad to see it's no longer as good as it used to be. The expanded outdoor seating is a great addition, considering that it used to be so tiny that maybe 5 people could dine comfortably inside. I'm not sure if it's cost, supply chain issues, or something else, but I was sadly disappointed in my tagliolini mushroom dish (formerly known as tagliolini porcini). First of all, the wrong pasta was used. Instead of tagliolini which resembles a thin, squarish spaghetti, I got a thick pappardelle. The mushrooms were heavily seasoned (with taragon?), which completely overpowered the dish so that I could barely taste the tomato cream sauce. Plus, the dish was so heavily salted that I could only finish half of it. I'm rooting for this place and hope they can turn things around."

There were so many delicious pasta dishes to choose from, and our side dish of spinach was generous and truly well cooked (yes, there's a right and a wrong way to do it). We had a nice conversation with the owner and one of the cooks, who seem like a great team. While we were there, the seating area was consistently full - a testament to their cooking, since they don't rely on cutesy decor or fancy cocktails to attract customers.I have a lot of respect for places like this, where the focus is on authentic and delicious food rather than trends. Pepe Rosso has been cooking real food for 24 years, and now that I have eaten here, I look forward to visiting many times in the next 24 years."

And I believe they add tahini to it? The cookie seems to have an extra nutty taste to it which really makes it that much better. It has now become my favorite CCC (better than levain in my opinion)! And I'm so impressed that it's vegan!

Upon visiting again after the years, their self-service machine did not work properly today. I was charged for what I paid for but the staff refused to give the items saying the machine didn't work properly. Until we had to pull up our bank statement that to show that we were charged, the staff reluctantly gave us what we paid for. No apology and full of attitude, the pastry was tiny and way overpriced.Overall really disappointed with the service and quality just went downhill."

As of the 2nd week of November 2020, they are still operating and serving drinks for take-out only.I ordered the oat milk latte here (in my quest to find the *best* oat milk latte in my walkable vicinity), and Seven Grams made me a very good latte. Great, balanced flavors - none of that hyper-acidic espresso stuff that other cafes nearby serve.Haven't tried the baked goods here. This place is a bit more hidden, so do make a stop here if you're in the area! Hope they weather through the pandemic storm."

No one else inside on a Friday morning as they're still getting their bearings.Interior is fresh and well put together. Big menu up top, seating near the windows, and pastries behind the glass. Decided on a large drip coffee ($4) as well as a slice of zucchini bread ($3ish). Zucchini bread is moist and flavorful. Coffee is strong (had to add a good amount of milk/simple syrup).They seem to have a rewards program (as opposed to a punch card) for the regulars. Despite lots of competition, I can see this spot sticking around."

This place definitely only remains in business because1- it's directly outside of the 3 train at Nostrand, so when people walk down and see there is a 20 minute wait for the train, they can walk back up to get a beverage/snack for their wait2- it's the only DD in the area"
2535,Fu7J2Fwoj_S6Jpg9dULzKg,3/6/2017,1 star rating,Went in this evening and ordered a few hot drinks. Mine was a large Vanilla Chai. The cup was half full when I crossed the street and started to drink it. The donut we got was also stale and hard chocolate iced ring donut. Guy taking order was very limited as far as understanding english and the other guy working there just disappeared into the back.I guess they just take advantage of thier clientele because it is grab and go because how close the train station and bus stop is.

I got the rose latte, which was delicious, but the there are so many options, like lavender, matcha, golden milk (turmeric) etc. love the vibes and there are a lot of seats to sit down. It gets hot in the summer so outdoor seating isn't ideal (but it's also lovely so worth checking out!). Gets quite busy and loud so not the best for reading a book , but pop some headphones in and it's a great place to study!"

That Rose Latte thoo! If you enjoy floral flavors this is a must try. It even had pieces of rose petals and a rose bud in it! Probably weird to most people. But I absolutely loved it! I ordered another right before I left so I can experience it one more time before I leave the city! LolPics are blurry. But it's a nice little glimpse. Also very friendly staff! Thank you!

Outro has a very nice covered back patio with overhead heaters, but the heater was not warm at all. Luckily, the cafe is tucked between tall buildings, so it wasn't as cold and windy. It would be really nice to dine outdoor during spring, summer, and fall. There's a QR code on every table. Once seated, scan the QR code and it will bring you to their website to place your order. We ordered:Matcha rose latte + oat milk (additional 50 cents)Maple bacon & egg waffleEggs benedictThe presentation was so pretty. Picture perfect. Latte art was exceptionally beautiful and delicious. Food was so good! Waffle was perfectly crisp, maple bacon and egg were perfectly seasoned and cooked. Eggs benedict had a great balance of sweet and savory. Their unique twist on hollandaise sauce with beet juice gave it a slight sweet taste. Amazing addition to the eggs benedict!Customer service was ehhh =/ Server did not clean our table or checked up on us. He brought our food to us and that was it. Help yourself, kinda vibe. On the other note, the barista heard that we needed water for our dog and was kind enough to give us a bowl of water. I would definitely come back for brunch!"

We ordered the berry ricotta toast and smoked n scrambled; both were really great (the bread is so fresh!) and presented super cutely as well. My favorite part about our meal was actually the drinks - we ordered the taro & matcha bomb which are coffee drinks topped with flavored cream. They were gorgeous and mildly sweet (the perfect level for me :-) )

The ordering system is convenient and you are able to self-seat yourself. The outdoor patio area is nice. Seems like a spot that caters towards social media posts. Nothing wrong with the food, just not the best bang for your buck for what you're actually getting. Service here is friendly. It took my friend a while to get his golden latte but everything else seemed to come out at a relatively reasonable time."

Good news is that they've revamped the interior and the bathroom. Restroom no longer smells bad! On the other hand, the cafe is very understaffed. There is a QR code placed in every table and you can view and order through your smartphone. There was a disclaimer on the menu stating that it may take more than 30 minutes for the food to come out during the peak hours. I went around 10:30 am on a weekday, which I assumed wasn't the peak hour, but I still had to wait 30 minutes for the food to be ready. The place was 40-50% full at the time, though. What's up with that? I saw two staff working, one of them still looking kind of new and not used to the work. The place may have cut down on labor costs in order to survive through the pandemic, but staff seemed overwhelmed and no one in NYC's got time to wait 30+ minutes for their food."

The yellow tail sashimi with jalapeño were cut way too thick and the sauce or whatever garbage it came with was tasted nasty. The cuts of sashimi were awful, the taste was gross, the smell was that rotten fishy smell. Overall, disgusting food. This place is the McDonald's of sushi...the salmon was frozen and still defrosting. Spend a little more and go to literally ANYWHERE else.

When I arrived I don't think the waitress fully understood my order because she said she didn't have Chocolate Milk or Whole Milk but was able to give me milk with the coffee that I ordered. The second biggest issue that I had was that I ordered my food as to stay but the cook wrapped it to go. I will give the waitress credit though as she did unwrap it herself and made it a dine in order.

Everyone in the restaurant is laid back. I felt as if I was inside an oasis from the madness of outside. I will definitely be returning. What a secret, I'm reluctant to post this review because all you hipsters out there will start flocking to this place. Menu selection is spectacular. Food is extremely fresh and well prepared.

2567,IiLLntICUim7YREkIBU7lA,10/16/2017,5 star rating,"So cheap with great portion sizes at roughly $8 for an omelette plate with home fries, two slices of toast, and a cup of orange juice or coffee. They were kind enough to let me order from the breakfast menu (which runs from 6AM - 12PM), despite it being 3PM. Only the drink wasn't included because it was past breakfast hours, which is completely fair.I ordered the Alpine omelette, a hearty and delicious blend of bacon and veggies.The ambience definitely has a homely, community vibe. On Saturday at 3PM, there was just one waiter and one cook. It seems that a lot of locals are regulars that come here to watch the game and they all know each other by name. Highly recommended if you're looking for a fulfilling, cheap diner breakfast."

It doesn't look like much. but they are so generous with the amount of food that's served on your plate. They are clean, they're dedicated, and affordable.

Ordered the lobster roll as an appetizer, which was savory with a blend of cajun spices, not your typical lobster roll with mayo. Bun was moist and super fluffy which absorbed the delicious juices from the lobster. The star of the show was the King Combo, which was a pound of crawfish and a pound of king crab, with the Boil Special sauce (garlicky, spicy, savory, finger licking good sauce). This was enough for two people and came with a side of corn and potatoes that were also beautifully seasoned. Paired refreshingly well with a Kiwi Frozen Margarita and Saint Mojito (lychee & rum)."

Although similar in tastes among the plentiful boil options NY has to offer, The Boil takes the cake for me. It's definitely all in the sauces and TB has the dankest of them all. The sauce is crack, you could literally put it on anything and it'll be fire. This location is less chaotic than the original spot but quality is still up to par. Clean and spacious, the perfect environment to get messy and dirty with your food which is all part of the experience. I personally go for the shramp as it's the best bang for buck for quantity, it's just science brah. I also typically order extra saus because well, that's really the star of it all and who wouldn't want breathe so garlicky hot you taste it for the rest of the day?! I find it gives me the confidence to talk to people way more so introverts eat up. If you want to spice up your life with a bit of flavor, this is it, but you'll need to look passed the cash only policy which is the only inconvenience this place is, especially when it's not a budget meal. 1 star off for dirty hole in the wall tax antics in a not so dirty hole in the wall establishment, otherwise would 12 out of 10 recommend. stay fat mother suckers"

The scent of spice and Cajun flavors that punched me squarely in the olfactory organ was reminiscent of a cartoon  character  floating on a wave of scent that stops them cold, beckoning  them towards it. This is exactly what you want to smell at a seafood establishment. I hope the food lives up to it. Because my bestie was late, I had time to sit and take in the atmosphere. 38 minutes as of this writing. The staff is so nice, relieving how awkward I feel sitting here in this giant ass booth alone. (Do I sound salty?)I digress. But because she is 41 minutes late, I had to ask for help with my temporary loaner phone (iPhone, ewl) and she brought me a charging device! I had no idea they offered that and would've never inquired. That was great to know since I've been entertaining myself with YT and online puzzles while simultaneously draining my battery . I'd never have known this had my friend not been 44 minutes late. They have a QR code for the menu but, because I was having technical difficulties they provided a paper menu. (I provided pics)The staff is so nice. I believe they think I got stood up on a tinder date (I see the ""oh you poor soul"" in their eyes) but it's just my pal that's now 48 minutes late. This was her idea. She picked it and invited me out. (Should I swipe left on this friendship?)The Boil has a nice laidback atmosphere and looks like a nice place to grab a few drinks. I'm not much of a boozehound but the bar looks substantial enough. (Then again, what do I know?)I've watched my share of couples and groups enter. Eat.And leave.And enter.Eat.Leave.Rinse & Repeat. No Fabric Softener.52 minutes in and I am sure I look hella sus (but cute) sitting here nursing ice water (which has long melted and is now room temperature slag)I busy myself vacillating between the  menu choices. Too much time + too many choices = meltdownMaybe I have undiagnosed adult ADD?56 minutes in and my acquaintance finally arrives . Suitcase in hand. (!).  (Am I being Punk'd? Where's Ashton Kutcher?)I had to guide her in from the train (but SHE picked this place!) Anyway by this time I'd talked myself out of a boil bag and chose a few items off the appetizer menu.NOTE: THIS IS A CASH ONLY BUSINESS!THIS IS CASH ONLY!CASH ONLY!OK? So don't come without cash, ok ?YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!I ordered the calamari, and soft shell crabs with seasoned fries. Then sent the squid back, because...reasons, and swapped it for a crab cake.Now, as a Northerner with deep fried southern roots, a frequent visitor to Maryland's Inner Harbor, and New Orleans, I KNOW seafood, and I LOVE seafood! And as a Southern raised Northerner, mama always said to focus of the positives.Soooo...the seasoned French fries were amazing. 10/10 would recommend the seasoned French fries. The seasoned French fries were great with the red sauce. I loved the seasoned French friesThe kinda familiar looking person sharing the booth with me; you remember, the late one; had the crab boil, which she liked.Ugh! Should've  had the daggone  boil!They add a 20% fee (tip) to your bill, so my poor beleaguered (albeit very nice and professional) server got less than if I were tipping freely. I'm a generous tipper (because although I, personally don't suck as a customer, most customers suck) but I get it as sucky people don't tip.The bill comes & the lady sitting with me puts down her CREDIT CARD! ‍*insert silent scream*It was quickly resolved thru the ATM conveniently located near the front door.All in all it was a nice day out and the stranger who shared my table was tolerable. But honestly save your coins and go elsewhere. And did I mention how much I loved the seasoned French fries?(Mama would be proud)"

Definitely probably easier to eat there in person but we enjoyed making an evening of it at home. The delivery took much longer than expected but I'm sure it must have been a busy evening for them...What we ordered:- King Crab Legs - AMAZING! While there isn't a ton of meat in crab legs, it was some of the best crab meat I've ever had- 1/2 pound shrimp + lobster - so so good. The Boil Special sauce is soooo tasty, and it literally comes swimming in it (I almost wanted to just keep the leftover sauce - it was THAT good). Soft Shell Crab Basket - quite fishy, neither my husband and I were huge fans; the fries were also pretty cold by the time we got them so we didn't eat- Mocktails - WOW! I honestly did not have super high expectations for these but they were SO good. My husband and I each got a diffferent plavor - one was passion fruit and one was mango - and they were the perfect complement to the seafood. For those looking for a non-boozy option - would highly reccomend!"

The meat inside the fried fish was super soft and the breading had great flavor. We tried their papaya salad and found it to be a bit underwhelming since there wasn't too much papaya and it was mostly lettuce. We opted to try the shrimp with heads and clams and I would recommend the shrimps over the clams. The shrimp was incredibly juicy and the Boil sauce was savory and tasty. The clams were okay, they were a bit tough so I probably would have preferred smaller clams instead."

I literally have nothing to complain about; I love that toasted bagels come out perfectly crisp and not too dense and just the -right- amount of spread (a lot of places end up putting too much imo). I once also got an egg sandwich here that wasn't bad at all, even though I'm not a big fan of scrambled egg (I got it bc I needed the protein after a workout).

If you're dining here for dinner, don't bother looking for street parking. Go park in the Alexandria Center parking lot. The restaurant will validate parking for up to 4 hours for just $5. The restaurant is inside the Alexandria Center for Life Science. I walked in with a lot of expectations for Riverpark. The atmosphere was very nice. The inside of the restaurant gave off romantic, elegant vibes. I was happy that I got seated near the window but then that quickly changed. Right in between the my dining experience and the nice view, you get a mix of a very casual outdoor beer garden vibes which was throwing off the vibes of my experience. Perhaps everyone inside was overdressed? I've heard great things about this place so I knew I had I had to try for myself. My savory dishes were not hot enough. The skate, the pasta were the better dishes. The popular pork belly, the octopus, the duck breast lacked flavors. The best part was dessert, the cereal and milk is a must! The service was flat."

It's hype is farm to table fresh food and the menu can change daily based on what's available that day. This is a collaborative partnership between the Riverpark restaurant and the Alexandria center. Tom Colicchio is both the chef and the owner. It's a great date spot if you want to impress and it boasts large spaces where you can spread out at your table. You can a conversation without worrying too much about the table next to you listening in. I had a great time and the service was top notch. They definitely pay attention to detail. The decor is modern, the restaurant is open and airy. There is outdoor seating and an outdoor bar area. It looks like a great place to hold a special occasion or a party. Overall the food was awesome,most of the portions such as appetizers and sides can be shared.  The deserts were great although in my opinion are good for only one person. We were a party of four, we shared several of the dishes. We started off with a bottle of Voces 2010 which was a red blend and there were only 160 cases produced. Great choice!!!  For appetizers we shared pasta which was the Farrotto which is roasted mushrooms, asparagus, thyme and Parmesan. They serve a very light focaccia bread with onion which was endless if you wanted more.For the main course we order two Grilled and slice Ribeye off the bone.  It comes with charred summer beans, smoked romesco hen of the woods mushroom and jus. We also ordered the Smoked Berkshire Pork Rack for two. This comes with baby carrots, bulb onions, corn bread, bacon/onion jam, candies pork belly and radish slaw. All main courses are served in a pan which results in a great presentation. For sides we had two of the baked greens which were topped with cheese. We sampled several deserts which were the coconut rice pudding, coconut Panna Cotta and we could not go without trying their famous Cereal and Milk which is chocolate ganache cake, caramelized rice puffs, and vanilla malt. It was awesome but not really enough to share.Your water glass or wine glass is not left empty. When the main course was served our waiter came over to each person to see how things were. He did not just address the table as a whole which was a nice touch.Overall this was a great experience and I would highly recommend River Park for a great night out. I came here about five years ago although was not on Yelp at the time. It was very nice then as well."

Sitting outside, two bottles of Albarino later, watching the sun set over the East River, this was the best Restaurant Week experience I've had ever. 1st Course: We started off with *the East and West Coast oysters (the West Coast ones were seriously jumbo sized).*Lamb Ragu Cavatelli (perfectly al dente) with charred corn, peppers, and parmesan2nd course: *Lamb Osso Bucco (this was tender and had a delicious amount of fat. That smoked eggplant was packed with flavor as well)*Roasted Skate & Octopus: The skate was perfectly crispy, and the texture of octopus was so perfect- not tough or chewy at all.Desserts:*Toasted Almond Panna Cotta*Cereal & Milk ($5 addition): chocolate ganache cake, caramelized rice puffs, vanilla malt.

Right away you are served a gorgeous selection of pastries. Piping hot. Just wonderful. The quiche was a solid choice as was the Branzino. Perfectly cooked Crispy skin. My only complaint of the day was the grain in the base of the dish was quite bland and a tad overcooked as it was mushy in a watery sort of way. To finish the meal you must try the milk and cereal dessert (donate a portion to charity!) and the passionfruit and black sesame dessert blew my mind. Really excellent. It goes without saying the view of east river is just spectacular. The ambiance is relaxing and classy inside. There was live jazz and a round of applause to their team for outstanding service. Definitely will be back to try out the evening menu.

The hummus, baba ganoush, fried cauliflower and spicy potatoes were my absolute favorites. It comes with 5 different sauces which is amazing. One's a red sauce, one's like a garlic aoili, I think one is some kind of yogurt sauce- most of them were also delicious. Also the presentation of this is cute, and functional as you can conserve space on your table and spin to what you want. KIBBEH LABANIEH- 7/10. I was pretty full by this point. its basically ground beef balls in a yummy yogurt sauce. Needed more beef.Their cocktails are delicious, pretty...and strong! i got some vodka and rose water cocktail which was pretty good, but not as sweet and not as rosey as I was thinking it would be. The menu had a lot of good options.I will say its pretty expensive! Our total came out to $175 for two people when we really got 2 drinks, an appetizer sampler and 1 entree to share.

A friend of mine was visiting from Australia and I was looking for something flavorful with great portion size. Au Za'atar fit the bill. I thought it was Mediterranean food judging by the pictures online but it's actually Lebanese! I couldn't recall having been to a Lebanese spot recently so that was a pleasant surprise and bonus. Even better is the fact that they had outdoor seating. So on a warm summer day the whole atmosphere comes together outside. My friend and I dined inside though. She was open to sharing which was perfect for dividing and conquering the menu. We had the Tabouli salad, Hummus and then we rounded that out with the Mixed Grill platter. I didn't drink any alcohol since I was driving and I had been awake nearly 24 hours so I can't speak for any of the drinks but if the food is any indication, I'm sure you're going to like it!

The food is mouthwateringly delicious and so vegetarian friendly. The first night, we ordered the Fattet Al-Betenjane and the grilled halloumi. The grilled halloumi was $17 for 3 measly pieces of halloumi, which is the reason I had to cut down a star. Nevertheless, flavor was great, and the servers always bring extra pita. The second night, we were with a group so we got the mezze and dips tower, which is so worth it.

My favorites are the regular and spicy hummus, baba ganoush, fattoush salad, halloum for starters. For mains the FILET MIGNON SHISH KEBAB,  FATTET LAHME, AREYDES, and SHISH TAWOOK (CHICKEN KEBAB). The dips they bring along side the pita are incredible too as well as all the pickled veggies. They also have great choices of after dinner teas. Love this place!"

My favorite was definitely the hummus and pita bread alongside all the extras and condiments that came along with this dish. The staff was also great and gave us more pita bread for the hummus when we asked. The restaurant itself was very beautiful. I would highly recommend Au Za'atar if you are looking to try middle eastern food!

The space is very tight inside with a lot of seats on the outside...some are covered and heated. Don't go here for ambiance, go for the food. Top notch middle eastern cuisine. We had the spicy falafel which was great and not too spicy. Also the grill platter for two was plenty of food for two people. I couldn't get enough of all the dips/sauces!"

The food is absolutely amazing, the service is quick and the ambiance resembles Middle Eastern. If a table is not available inside, do not hesitate to sit outside. This please is kind of pricey but totally worth it. Definitely a MUST!"

It was still a little chilly in the store. Their main selling item is the tableside Shawarma. We realized that it's not on the menu, but it is available for around $100 and takes up to an hour to be prepared. Lucky for us it only took about 25 minutes. The meal was very heavy and as it came with what looked like pounds of fries. The chicken was very well seasoned and the sauces were a great touch. Since we were seated on a very small table for two, The dish pretty much took up the whole table. Basically everything was crammed in one corner of the table. The good thing about having all this food was we had plenty of leftovers for the week! Overall, this was a good experience and I'm glad I gave it a try!"
2611,OqNmzS2N2I750zYgUC6IgA,12/6/2022,5 star rating,Nami Nori was one of the best dining experiences I've had this year. First of all the restaurant is decorated beautifully - you can really tell how much thought went into each aspect. I had a 5 PM dinner reservation right when they open and the restaurant was almost immediately filled up! Service was very kind and helpful.I started off with some sake and miso soup. The miso soup already blew me away - it was topped with carrots and tofu and had a lovely flavor. Next I tried the vegan set! Every temaki was unique and flavorful - I really enjoyed the selection. My favorite two were the maitake truffle and the eggplant red miso. I also tried both of the desserts - churros with a lemon curd and a sesame miso chocolate chip cookie. I definitely recommend the churros over the cookie - they were freshly fried and the curd was delicious. Can't wait to be back!

In my opinion a set of five is barely enough, a good amount of food would be a set of seven.Some pieces are very well done and creative but some others, the flavor are ok. Recommended piece: xo scallop, spicy crab dynamite, yellowtail scallion"

Pleaseeeee get both!! Absolutely incredible. For the temaki we had a variety - got the lobster, yellowtail, ako ebi, tuna, etc... highly recommend the yellowtail and ako ebi! Also u folding the temaki is really fun and by the end of the meal you become an expert. For dessert we got the cookie and it wasn't bad! Was very chewy and soft."
2615,OqNmzS2N2I750zYgUC6IgA,9/9/2022,5 star rating,"TLDR: Although the ""open hand roll"" concept is in right now, Nami Noris are the folks who started this whole thing in the first place. Nobody does it as well as t hey do. Spicy Crab Dynamite, XO Scallop and don't sleep on that Maitake Truffle.The Williamsburg outpost is just as good as the West Village location with the exception that they don't have the chive yogurt dip. WHY?!?! Other than that though - everything is just as good. It might even be better here.We were fortunate enough to be sat with Sho on our last visit. Every roll she made, was fan-frickin'-tastic. I actually never liked the XO scallop before. Every time I ate it at West Village it was very meh to me. Not here, the one Sho prepared for me was delicious. It made me a believer.If you're trying out Nami Nori for the first time, stick with the signature set to get a feel and definitely get the furikake fries."
2616,OqNmzS2N2I750zYgUC6IgA,10/31/2022,3 star rating,"The food is good, but I feel that it's more of a gimmick. It's basically just sushi in a slightly different form/presentation.Our waitress didn't write our order and just relied on her memory. We told her that we're going to share the signature set. We ended up getting 2 sets so they brought one back to the kitchen. We also ordered furikake fries, which never came.The shishito pepper appetizer however, is delicious and was the best thing about the whole dinner.Our waitress didn't check on us at all, otherwise we could remind her on what we ordered."
2617,OqNmzS2N2I750zYgUC6IgA,8/14/2022,4 star rating,"I made a reservation online for two for outdoor dining and we were able to get seated immediately when we arrived. The outdoor seating area is in front of the restaurant and it's an open space without air conditioning. It got quite hot when my friend and I dined there, but at least the lighting was good. I wanted to make my own set and chose x.o. scallop ($8), aka ebi ($10), toro & scallion ($12), salmon & avocado ($7), yellowtail & scallion ($7). Out of these five, I really loved x.o. scallop and the aka ebi. They were both so soft and delicious. Overall, the food was pretty good but it came out to be $44 before tips and tax. My friend also got his own set with basically the same hand rolls and both of us left feeling still a little hungry."
2618,OqNmzS2N2I750zYgUC6IgA,1/16/2023,4 star rating,"Great spot for lunch! I recommend the furikake fries and the coconut shrimp temaki - both were delicious!! The signature set is a decent starter set for temaki, but honestly some of the pieces did not stand out like the tuna poke one. I would say to pass on the calamari too."
2619,OqNmzS2N2I750zYgUC6IgA,11/2/2022,4 star rating,"Cute little unique sushi spot - we got there a little early and there was a farmer's market across the street so we were able to wander around before our reservation. It is a small space but the space is utilized well. For the two of us, we got the tuna crudo, signature set, and brunch set.We've never had temaki before but we enjoyed this experience! It also helps that they are cute and miniature sized too. I do feel like there is a lot of ""plastic wrapping"" for each temaki although I believe the wrappers are made from plants. Each temaki is about a two/two and a half bite but although they look small, they are quite filling. I had a bite of most of my fiance's set and I was very stuffed by the time I got to the last two of my own temaki. My favorite from the signature set was the coconut shrimp! I wish I had eaten that first because I saved it for last and I could only eat a bite as I was so full. I would say the brunch set is a little more modern, with a smoked salmon, and one similar to an ""everything bagel"" type. The tuna crudo was awesome, the cuts of tuna were very ""meaty"" - they were large pieces! Oftentimes when we order crudo, the pieces are very thin but this crudo was large and chunky in the best way.I would definitely come back on our next trip to NY/Brooklyn."

We had a reservation and were seated a little late (at no fault of the restaurant) and they gave us a couple complimentary appetizers. Really appreciated the service and attentive to detail. For appetizers, we shared the cucumber tataki, the spicy tuna dip, the mushroom dip, and crispy calamari. All great options. I liked the traditional preparation of the cucumber. Dips and calamari were fantastic too. For the main course, I had the signature temaki set. A great introduction to temaki. Usually I go for all the market specials, but decided to trust the chefs and opt for their hall mark items. I really liked how approachable yet rich the temaki were. Also had a bottle of sake from local distillery - Brooklyn Kura. For dessert we had the cookie and churros. Definitely recommend both! Two gender neutral restrooms; I believe one was handicap accessible. Both were spacious."
2621,0FaLilJs2VN83hOEBcBnPg,3/20/2021,4 star rating,A nice little find! I'm obsessed with Shakshuka! Tomato based dish with eggs only the very friendly owner suggested we try it with mini Moroccan meatballs. Sauce had a good amount of heat and the flavor was good!! Also got the French toast with orange blossom honey and almonds except the put walnuts on it instead not a deal breaker I like both. French toast was delicious. What would've made it better would've been a nice toasty crusty bread to dip in the Shakshuka instead of pita bread and the eggs were so over cooked which isn't how the dish is served but when I return I'll let ask them to not overcook my eggs. Good menu definitely will return!

I had the meatballs which came with nicely seasoned veggies. I am not a fan of beets, but these were good. The potatoes were perfectly cooked. The pita bread came warm and was tastefully fresh. If I had been looking for a home cooked meal, then this is it.Reasonably priced and a pleasant stop after i had gone to get my oil change nearby. For my car, not me personally.I found street parking nearby. Yes!"

I was far from disappointed with my decision! We had grabbed coffee at Starbucks in our block-spinning while we waited for Merzouka to open, but I ended up getting a rose iced tea anyway and it was so refreshing and fragrant. My frittata was delicious! I loved the crispy melted cheese on top, reminded me of cheez it's and Detroit style pizza crust. My boyfriends french toast was decadent and so unique as well. Their whole menu was unique and I can't wait to try everything else! I also grabbed some of the almond cookies to bring home and they were great."

Of course they didn't come back...how much do you underpay them? If you were a decent manager, they would have done it out of respect. I left the hospitality field when I was 26 - with 10 years experience. I was trained in formal service. With that knowledge you can relax the service but you can't go up, without studying.

I can tell you, this is one of the cleanest and best take out Chinese spots in East Flatbush. I've been eating here for decades, and they were always known as ""Dynasty"".. as they recently changed names over the past year to Hong Kong King Plaza/Palace. Even in the late 90's.. my Mum and I would order from them on treat days...as they were further out and would charge us a delivery charge.. and spending $30 bucks on Chinese in 91' or 92...really was a treat.... Our favourties were Moo Shoo Pork...Pork Dumplings.. Shrimp Dumplings..Fried Rice...etc. and to this day... they still are for me. When I attended Brooklyn College, students would take the extra walk here..for a good/clean meal...and one where we could sit and enjoy before going back to classes..Fast forward to my current life...where I live in the area and frequent here on a weekly basis... I've never had a bad meal. They know my son and I on a first name basis... know that I love my tofu steamed.. not fried... they know when I just need a large box of white rice because I've already cooked our fish/meat at home...and I'm running late...lol. They know that I love our pork dumplings well done...extra sauce on the side... Their fried rice is light ( i always add egg).... noodles for lo mein are a little thick for my liking..and I wish they had crinkle cut fries..and not the skinny ones.. but these are minimal complaints..lol.. I always get 2 cups of Chinese tea to go with our meals...and I can't tell you how many times I've been given a free lemonade... or free watermelon in the summer... The head guy up front is very friendly and will have the chefs make whatever you like for a fair price ( I like my General Tso's Chicken with extra broccoli... thank you very much).. House Special Mei Fun.... minus chicken.. spicy...They are one of the few places that makes good dumplings... almost as good as trekking into Chinatown... They have my favourite Chinese broccoli.. (not many take out Chinese spots in the hood have this .. and that's just a fact...maybe in Park Slope.. but not here)... I'd ignore any crappy reviews and give them a shot if you need a good meal.. I mean how many people can review a place that they've been eating at since they were 10 years old?.. So trust me... PS - Don't sit at the first table by the window...that has the special tea pots and cushions... that's reserved for family members... I saw someone sit there a few weeks back and wanted to curse him out.. but I had the kid with me... lol...Enjoy...."

2647,yM4RnBagNy7gNrWb9PfzOA,7/9/2008,5 star rating,"Having almost given up on finding excellent and authentic Shanghai and Cantonese style Chinese food in our Flatbush Brooklyn neighborhood, we were very pleasantly surprised to find Dynasty Chinese Restaurant.Being originally from San Francisco and having a plethora of Chinese restaurants competing for my appetite and attention, I was disappointed in the few Chinese restaurants we had tried here.  I was more than a bit chagrined to discover this gem literally blocks away from our home.Our first order was for delivery.  The food arrived very quickly (under 25 minutes) and was PIPING hot.  Taking the clear plastic tops off of the large metal containers, steam rolled off the food and filled the room with the delicious aromas of authentic Asian cooking.  It should be noted that not only was the food well packaged, but it was arranged and presented in the rectangle containers as if we were being served in a fine restaurant.  Obvious care had been taken in making sure the food was as pleasing to the eye as to the stomach.And it was.  As we ate we kept turning to each other saying things like,"" Wow!"" and ""Outrageous!"" As we had ordered several dishes with rice and soup, we found that after sating our ravenous appetites, we still had enough food left over for a very satisfying second day lunch.A couple of weeks went by and I suggested that we walk over to the restaurant for their $5.25 lunch special.I sort of feared the worst; a dingy ill-lit, hole-in-the-wall with sticky tables and foldout style chairs.  Do you remember when Dorothy Gale and her yellow-brick road pals were asking the great and powerful Oz for his help?  Toto pulled back the curtain to the wizened old Carney's light and smoke control booth only to discover that the Emerald City's most illustrious leader was in fact a bona fide fraud.  I had the same thoughts about Dynasty until we walked inside.  There is no ""curtain.""  You can see the entire kitchen from front to back.  Polished and shining chrome walls, pristinely clean floors and booths and a casually uniformed staff that was efficient and polite.Our cooked-to-order lunch was as excellent as the dinner we had ordered a couple of weeks ago, provided ample leftovers for the next day, and surpassed our expectations once again.  After two dining experiences I would recommend the chicken and eggplant with garlic sauce, the orange chicken flavored with large shavings of orange peel, and the homemade wonton soup.  Also, don't pass up what could be the best lunch deal in Flatbush.While grander Chinese restaurants may prevail in other boroughs I think I have learned several lessons:1. Have the courage to try new places and things...2. Trust your heart that you can find what you're looking for....3. Use your brain when searching for a good deal... 4. And most of all...when looking for new experiences or culinary adventures remember Dorothy's famous mantra, ""There's no place like home!"""

It's good Chinese takeout and always kept clean. They usually have the discovery channel on quietly inside the store.Interestingly, I've noticed the General Tso's chicken has lots of chicken and 2 pieces of broccoli, the opposite problem another yelp reviewer mentioned (they got lots of broccoli, little chicken). The ratio of vegetables to meat may depend on the dish that you order. They seem pretty nice and reasonable behind the counter, I would ask them if you can have half chicken and half vegetables if you're concerned about this."

Which I had not. So here is the best part of the story. A woman from Dynasty calls me back and insist that I keep calling there and placing orders. I tell her it was the first time I ever ordered, and I placed the order online. She starts yelling at me telling me that I was calling and stopping calling them.

Of course the music was very entertaining tonight, live music every Sunday if I am not mistaken. For a place that doesn't serve food a thought the drink menu was on the small side.

I kind of liked the darker lighting and ambience of the place, but it's definitely frequented by a much older crowd and lots of people by themselves sipping on their drinks contemplatively, which is fine if you're into that sorta thing. There also tends to be very mediocre soft/dad rock playing quietly in the background, which seems to pander to the crowd they draw in there. I won't be back, but if you like sipping on a few drinks by yourself without any judgment and listening to some classic dad rock, this might be just the place for you!"

With that said, the letlove inn bar is a great low key spot to grab a cocktail, listen to some old school jams and just relax. The reason for the 4 stars is that I think the service could be better. If my drink is empty for over 5 minutes and you haven't asked me if I want another round (and you're not that busy), that's a problem. But despite that, I enjoy this place and absolutely will be back."

Upon starting a friendly conversation I was completely shut down by the rude bartender named Chris. I tried to make friendly conversation with Chris and was continuously shut down or blatantly ignored. Word of advice: the ""too cool for school"" attitude isn't cute. It's annoying and off putting. Will NOT return."

We all bought drinks and tipped the guy.As someone who has worked in the service industry, I have never witnessed such open disdain for good people bringing in business.He acted like a petulant parent. He told us that he 'didn't want to ask us again.' Again, it was 1am on a Friday. There were five people there. Everyone was over the age of 40. Someone was wearing long white socks with new balance sneakers.I guess the bartender likes his bars quiet and empty. I hope this bar gets quieter and emptier."

The interior consists of that well-worn, antique décor that so many other bars in and around NYC all seem to have. Cocktails were decent (I had the Queen Bee). Since it was NYE, the place got super crowded shortly after we had arrived, so I'm not sure if that's how it's like normally. Would definitely like to return in the near future, though."
2661,YJqM9wxCH-PNslHbffzbGg,6/27/2020,4 star rating,"While the fear of COVID-19 has taken away indoor dining (rightfully so), I've really enjoyed seeing how creative local restaurants have been in getting up and running again. More than how they do it, I'm just happy they are doing it because man oh man do I miss everything. Brookvin is no exception--not only have they converted their front window into a super convenient pick up station but they have some fun deals throughout the week. Take out liquor has probably been the only bright spot in this lockdown hell, and I was so happy when Brookvin, one of my fav wine bars, opened back up. Monday's they are offering $20 for a good sized Mac N Cheese entree and two glasses of wine to go. When I saw the chalkboard advertising this my first thought was ""oh HELL yeah."" Thankfully it did not disappoint, the Mac n Cheese was pleasant and a little mild--not too intensely cheesy or goopy but perhaps lacking a little flavor. The rosé in particular was out of this world considering I was drinking it from a little plastic cup. Perhaps $20 is a little steep for what it is, but I'm happy to spend it--god knows I woulda at the bar with just two glasses of wine anyhow. I will definitely have to come back for more take out wine, it seriously makes me too happy. Glad you're up and running, keep up the great work!"
2662,YJqM9wxCH-PNslHbffzbGg,1/16/2023,4 star rating,Nice place to meet up with friends to catch up. They have a good wine and small plate selections . Staff is very friendly. They have indoor and outdoor seating.
2663,YJqM9wxCH-PNslHbffzbGg,5/16/2021,5 star rating,"Unintentionally ended up at Brookvin for the end of Happy Hour on Friday evening. A wonderful wine bar that has a manageable, but highly diverse and delicious wine list, and arguably an even better kitchen.Quality: It is great to find another excellent wine bar in the Park Slope area. They have figured out the right balance of wines and food, and established a comfortable, but casual atmosphere. We started out with wines off the Happy Hour menu, I had the Fado red wine, while my girlfriend went with the Arrumaco rose, both were solid. We later shifted gears and selected a bottle of the Bieler ""La Jassine"" Cotes Du Rhone Villages, which was an excellent follow-up. The food was great as well. We ordered the Chicken Liver Mousse Pate, which was rich and creamy and a wonderful compliment to our Charcuterie and Cheese items. We only ordered Prosciutto for meats, but for cheese went with the Manchego Curado, La Tur, and Bucheron. Do not miss the Bucheron, a soft cheese that just melts as you eat it, but the others were solid as well. I also love that each cheese comes with a jelly pairing, the jalapeno one was especially fun. And you will receive a ton of delicious toast with each item, just a little burnt and drizzled in olive oil.Quantity: The first time I think I have ever seen a place give more bread than you need with the different Charcuterie and Cheese items. It helps fill you up and it did not hurt that the bread was excellent.Value: $8 for the Happy Hour Wines. $12 for the Chicken Liver Mousse Pate. $10 for each Charcuterie or Cheese item, but the price goes down as you select multiple items. Ambiance: Brookvin is a wine bar located in the southern area of Park Slope. They currently have outdoor dining in a structure in front of the bar, a more regular outdoor dining area in a cute patio in the back of the space, and spread out tables and bar seating inside. The outdoor seating went quickly on this beautiful evening, so we ended up at a table in the back of the indoor space. It did have a nice window and open door so we at least got to enjoy some of the weather. It has a very casual feel, maximizing coziness. An old fireplace sits near the back and it isn't hard to imagine having a drink on a cool or rainy evening. The music was quiet, but they played bright and lively pop music to get folks into the weekend.Crowd: On a perfect Friday evening, reservations were a requirement. Though I would guess it is frequently the situation on weekends, regardless of weather.Service: Extremely friendly service. Even though they needed us to leave for the next seating of guests, they did it in a very kind manner, which is rare.Parking: Limited street parking on the nearby residential streets."
2664,YJqM9wxCH-PNslHbffzbGg,8/21/2021,1 star rating,"Things started well enough. Our party of three ordered food, wine, and cocktails throughout the afternoon. We were there a few hours, but at no point did we hear of a limit on how long we could be at the table. At about 6:45pm, our server informed us that a reservation of four was due at 7:00pm and he needed the table. We were a bit surprised because this was the first we'd heard of the time limit, but we complied and asked to close our tab. Our bill was $165.00, not including the 20+% tip I left. We paid and when our server picked up the check, he informed us that the party of four had, indeed, arrived. We finished our drinks and left the table.As we were leaving the bar, we noticed how empty the place was. The back garden was pretty full but the inside and seating out front were both empty. We didn't see anyone waiting for a table of four.  At about 7:05pm, while still waiting for our Uber, I went back in to see if the table was, in fact, taken by the party of four who had supposedly already arrived. Not only was the table empty but it had been split into two empty tables. And no one was waiting. Our server was no where in sight. This was completely uncalled for, and wildly strange, behavior. At worst case, our server could have said, ""hey, we have a 7pm reservation for the garden, but we can move you inside or to our street side seating"" as they were empty. Why lie? Why rush us out? We were spending money and enjoying a wonderful afternoon. And the place was dead, I understand how tough it's been for the food and beverage industry during the pandemic, and I have done what I can to support them during this time. I've spent some good times and good money in Brookvin and have never been asked to cut an evening short. I'd like to think tonight was an aberration, maybe there was some misunderstanding, but from everything I saw, our server decided that we'd been there long enough, so he lied that the table was needed by another party when it clearly wasn't. We weren't drunk nor were we loud. We're simply enjoying our afternoon. I typically don't take to Yelp for something like this. I understand the industry and support it as much as I can. Today was different. On the way home, we checked reservations for Brookvin to see how busy they were going to be tonight. Almost all time slots were open. In fact I don't remember seeing anything booked, but there may have been a few. I won't be coming back and I will recommend to others to follow my lead. There are too many other places that need, deserve, and appreciate my business."

I would expect a place like this to be packed, but even though they take reservations, you can usually walk in and get seated. It's clearly beloved by locals--the atmosphere is relaxed and convivial without being packed. I hope it stays this way!You can't go wrong with the happy hour drinks. I've had both the rose and the white, and they were both fantastic (the white was actually dry). The choose-your-own cheese and meat board was also excellent--one of the best I've had. It is on the pricier side, but hey if you're getting a glass of wine for $8, it's worth spending a bit more on good quality food. Oh and I did I mention the $7 HH mac n' cheese? It looks small, but it's actually the prefect portion for two to share if you plan to nibble on some small plates afterwards. We got the ricotta tartine and meatballs. Gosh, that sauerkraut is on point. They have seating in the garden which is lovely. Highly recommend it if the weather is nice."

We were seated outside, among other tables that were there longer than we were, and we were consistently ordering food and drinks. Then, out of nowhere, we were told that a reservation of 4 was coming in soon and we had to give up our table. We understood and wrapped up our bill, then as we're finishing our drink, he came over again and said we need to leave now because the table just arrived. I was embarrassed and felt bad, so of course, my party got up and walked out to find that there was NO party of 4 waiting for the table and when I went back in, they had separated the table into two tables, with no one sitting at either one. I'll never be going back here."

Riverdale in Bronx New York would not be a place to find a BBQ Hit Parade standout, but looks and location are deceiving.

She's very clear to explain that when she designed the restaurant the BBQ pit was the first order of business and everything else just put in around it. Love her priorities! Ribs are great, sauce is perfect, Tandoori Chicken is a fav, sides of pinto beans and spinach show off her heritage and passion to make vegetables taste right. The vegetarian biryani is wonderful.

They really want you to come back. The Mozzarella Sticks are a good choice for appetizer. The Catfish is a very good choice for entree. The Ribs I was told are very popular there. The BBQ sauce comes in a warm bottle, and left for you to pour it on yourself. It definately taste better with the sauce. The Collard Greens were very undercooked, almost raw. The Sweet Potatoes were not that sweet. The Mash Potatoes with gravy was pretty decent. Not the best BBQ I have had, but the place is okay."

The owner, Rani, is not only a wonderful cook but also a wonderful person. When I was recovering from surgery, she made sure I knew I could call on her if I needed anything, something that really meant a lot to me.

Very grilled taste and not slathered with sauce. They give extra sausage on the side. Came with 2 sides. Had Cole slaw and sweet potatoes. Both very good. Only downside was the 2 slices of (homemade) pie. Apple and blueberry. Both were not eatable for me. I would go there again. Just no pie.

The stench upon entry was the first initial red flag but i tried chalking it up to the garbage out front despite the lingering smell.  As far as the food goes, it was subpar. Chicken looked old And was unreasonably hard. Decided to just eat the rice and peas but Overall  very unpleasant experience."

Dry cornbread I wouldn't recommend or order again. Don't waste your money
2704,Xj_zTbX7_xVV9CFRSGKt8w,1/12/2021,5 star rating,Soul food at its best and service with a smile the food is tasty and worth every dollar spent it's the new spot to go to when your Mac and cheese craving won't let go there bbq chicken will have you licking your fingers and the fried chicken is so good can't  wait to stop buy again.
2705,Xj_zTbX7_xVV9CFRSGKt8w,6/4/2018,2 star rating,"Okay 2 things. Keep in my mind this place 5 mins from where I live. Only reason I've brought food here. Usually when I'm feeling too lazy to cook or travel for eats. #1 this is a large meal. 17 dollars by itself. First of all I'm under the impression that these ppl are struggling to profit from this business so they beat the neighborhood in the head with prices in ocean hill Brownsville (You're not in Chelsea or the lower east side) the food is not worth the prices. The yams are the texture of mashed potatoes and then have the nerve to be burnt , what type of bs is that ? Chicken greasy and blan. String beans decent. Please check out ""Thee Seven Sisters"" on Ralph avenue , 5 mins away from this place, get you a good fried chicken meal, and some good Yams that they take they're time to chop, cost you 10 dollars ! Or check out T-Roc homestyle cooking also on Ralph ! Where nothing is over 17 dollars okay ! #2 It's always empty (go figure) and I stopped going to Bed stuy fish fry because of the lines. (lines are a good sign). The customer service is horrible and disgusting, the menu is confusing and makes no sense, I've never seen a menu like it in any establishment. I've been here a total of 4 times and every time I was unsatisfied but also determined to support local businesses however, my experience was that of No type of professionalism at all and what so ever. They act like they're doing you a favor. When the Chinese restaurant near by has more traffic and gets more business. But this is the third restaurant that has opened at this location in just 4 years so go figure."

I highly recommend this place. The food is fresh and made to order so I recommend calling in to place you order and then picking it up (takeout only during covid)."
2707,Xj_zTbX7_xVV9CFRSGKt8w,4/16/2019,1 star rating,Lunch was hot. But fish was dried out. Rasta pastas was strangling me. Yams are horribly bad.  Worse meal i spent $20.00 on. I I willnot be ever going back. I tried to support my black own business but them chicks cannot i mean can't cook. Every meal should be served with love. And they have the nerve to be expensive lolrotmff. Tossed it out. Smh!! No i wont be coming back as you said as i left out your door.
2708,Xj_zTbX7_xVV9CFRSGKt8w,8/3/2019,3 star rating,We ordered via door dash. Driest jerk Chicken I ever had. Tasty jerk seasoning but chicken was like jerky....beef jerky. Stew chicken and the Rasta pasta with oxtails were very good and tasty. Cabbage with the meal was sooo good with a different seasoning than expected but the cabbage and greens ordered on the side lacked seasoning. It was the end of the night so we probably got the last of the last that had dried out over time. I can say that they do give good portions of food but need to keep an eye on that jerk chicken.
2709,Xj_zTbX7_xVV9CFRSGKt8w,2/15/2019,4 star rating,"I will start from the beginning of my experience:  I am thrilled that this place has opened back up. It was formerly Edna's. Upon entering I noticed the set up is pretty much the same: huge glass partition separating us from the vittles!  Lol!  Good thing is the food is clearly displayed and if you're like me (eat w/my eyes first!) you will enjoy this display.  I saw the reviews. I did not know they had a backyard area.  I've only don't takeout when it was the other spot. So I go order my food. Turkey wing dinner ($12 and it comes w/2 sides and cornbread); and an order of fried shrimp a la carte ($12). It's $2 extra for Mac n cheese. But Yelpers. You know I do not play when it comes to Mac & cheese. So I ask, cautiously, for a taste.  She doesn't know it, but this is both a request AND a test.  The cashier goes over and asks the young lady serving up the plates if I can have a taste.  A loud response from the girl about wasting her 'stuff'. But she concedes.  Good for her!  Cuz Hunty I cannot tell you how that leaves a bad taste in my mouth when eateries will not let you sample something in order to base your decision on that!  So I taste. It is a very nice effort. Super cheesy. But has taste. I pay the extra 2 bucks. Ok. Enough with the narrative. Let's get down to de brass tax!!!The shrimp was for me. So I rip open the bag as soon as I'm in the car.  Yaaay!  They are decent sized. And batter is nicely seasoned and crunchy.  Yum. I fish around in the bag for the tarter.  My other hand on the wheel cruising down Atlantic Ave.  I say out loud to myself (hey, what can I say?  I'm single) that the tarter must be homemade cuz it was barely a teaspoon. But my goodness!   How delicious!  Note to self: ask for extra tarter on the next visit.Once I get to my destination I crack open my mom's turkey wings dinner. The turkey wings are a lil lacking in moisture. But my mom likes the tips crispy. So I guess she'll make due. The candied yams are sticky dark and amazing!  The Mac is the Mac. I'm underwhelmed by time I get a couple forkfuls in my face.  But I'm full. So there's that.  The cornbread is SOOOO FRIGGIN' GOOD!  Taste like cake n cornbread all rolled up in one. Y'all know what I mean!  That gooood kinda cornbread!  I pinched off a nice piece. I will save that for my mama too. Verdict: I will definitely be back!  Next time I'm going to try the fried whiting. I think that next time will be after work tomorrow!  Lol!  I will pray that the banana pudding is 'assembled' (the plate maker used that term. I thought it was cute. Lol!). That's why I didn't try it today.  For all my local Brooklynite Yelpers: please go. Give this spot a try.  Keep the doors open. Not just cuz it's black owned, but because it is good food in the hood."

Soaked with oil. It was really gross.  The rice and beans ( Moro de gandules) were hard and tasted like it was 2 days old. The worse $40 I spent in a long time.

Overall, the food was pretty good but it bothered me that nothing was actually hot, it was lukewarm at best.The food:Mofongo de Pollo- The mofongo here was good but sits in your stomach like a brick, it is filling! The flavor was good but I wish the tostones were more crisp, it did get better the more you ate it.Chicharron de Cerdo- Fried Pork Chunks- I enjoyed the flavor but the pieces were super fried, it was actually kinda hard.Chivo Guisado- Goat stew- The meat was super tender and really flavorful, I thought the sauce was great. This is a must order item. Yuca- loved the onions, had a nice garlic taste throughout"
2717,Xj_zTbX7_xVV9CFRSGKt8w,4/3/2020,1 star rating,Good is good can't complain but why now they taking advantage on charging a delivery fee service and taxes. On top of that we give a tip. It's not right that u guys are now taking advantage of people who are stuck at home. U charging Uber eats price. What ever happened  to free. The guy is coming on a bike. From a $14 meal now i have to pay $19 for a meal. What u think u are tao or phillipes.  That's not caring for your customers or your community that's just being selfish and abusing of your customers

My girl Tita makes my coffee the best! I love Starbucks but they don't have anything on the bustelo from the espresso machine.  The mangu is always on point, tres golpes is the usual order in the morning if not then avena is my next choice.  The choices and food are infinite and you'll find pretty much all of the traditional Dominican dishes, I recommend this place 11 times out of 10!  Yes you read that right!"

2722,Wa9hSbduX6KTxvm4wLh_7w,11/10/2020,4 star rating,"When is the last time you had an iced chai latte with oat milk? I can't imagine this drink being displeasing to anyone. You get the creaminess of milk without any of the lactose, the slight sweetness from the syrup, the fragrant notes of chai, not to mention the little energy boost you get from the tea. Coffee Rx makes theirs to perfection, even creating the pretty gradient effect you get before the tea and the milk are fully mixed together. It's the little things, okay? I also tried their maple bourbon latte, which is a beautiful blend of bourbon, maple syrup, and coffee that serves as both a dessert and a vehicle for caffeine. It is a delicious drink. Their menu is full of seasonal drinks like a pumpkin spice latte, specialty drinks like a nutella latte or a rose latte, and classic drinks like macchiatos, red eyes, and even smoothies.Their indoor area is closed for patrons but they have a cute little backyard to enjoy your beverages at, and even provide WiFi so you can bring a laptop to work there on a nice day.

However, I don't understand why, when I choose to order a large size coffee drink, I am asked whether I'd like ""extra milk or an extra shot of espresso"" and then I will be further up charged no matter which I choose. I pay more for the large size, that is not simply for the size of the cup, it is also for what comes in the cup. This system makes no sense, if the milk or the extra espresso costs more, incorporate it into the price of the large coffee drink."

Situated on York Avenue, it caters to Yorkville locals, many who have been regulars for years. The owner typically makes the rounds checking in on the tables, and it has a nice buzz.On to the food! I love red sauce, so I usually go for that. Paired with reasonably priced red wine, Arturo's shines particularly in the colder months. I've tried the caesar salad, clams casino, manicotti, and ravioli, and everything's great. Their red sauce is especially delicious, with a sweet, perfectly pureed consistency. I never leave a drop of red sauce behind.Every New Yorker deserves a neighborhood red sauce restaurant as great as Arturo's."
2736,fWsl80ThqVxFQJ11b9_qhQ,10/26/2020,4 star rating,"COVID-19 Adjusted so decor does not affect the review.Friday evening and thinking about dinner. Decided Arturo's. No disappointment here. Food was delicious, fresh and good plentiful. First came the baked clams. Most restaurants, start with chopped clams as the base mixed with a lot of breading. Arturo's has a 3 different options. First of all, they start with whole clams, not chopped. Bonus. You could choose either the standard breaded baked clam or opt for either the clams in tomato and garlic sauce or what we went with the clams with bacon and chopped pimento..delicious.Next comes the mains..Chicken Cacciatore. Was good but not the best we ever had. Veal Marsala with mushrooms is the way to go. Veal stuffed with mozzarella and prosciutto in a marsala sauce and some mushrooms...um um good! Definitely, would repeat having it.Finally, coffee and a canoli. Coffee, hot and bold. Canoli, didn't have the heavy filling that usually fills up the tub. More of a lighter airy filling. Nope, won't reorder it.Lastly, service. Attentive but not overbearing. Not affecting the review but worth mentioning as COVID-19 has forced us all to eat in the street. Arturo's did their best to setup outdoor dining. Unfortunately, the restaurant is on a slight hill so we felt like we were taking off for a plane ride. Perhaps with the coming back of indoor dining this will be a non issue."

Came here on a Saturday night with reservations, but arrived early and without the full party, so asked to sit at the bar area. Staff was super accommodating and said we could sit in the lobby seats while we ordered a drink and waited another 30 minutes for our friend before finally asking to sit inside. Such a pretty place, whether in the lobby, the main dining hall, or what we could see of the second floor. Decor is definitely for plant lovers!Though it's beautiful and romantic inside, the food pictures came out horrible, but the food itself is super delicious! That said, I would say you can get similar delicious for much cheaper in Chinatown, but for the ambiance and location, the prices are reasonable and the portion sizes are decent, not too small. For 5 people, we had 7 dishes, 3 bowls of rice, and a few drinks - the total after taxes and tip came close to $400.Salted Egg Yolk Lobster: definitely the star of the night for me (but when isn't lobster the highlight??) with its rich salted egg yolk flavor. While the taste is spot on, I do wish it was easier to eat and they had taken the shell off so each bite would be lobster meat and salted egg yolk coating. Mmmmmm yummmSpicy Fried Pork Belly: soo crispy and delicious! Basically a thinner cut version of salt and pepper pork chops found at Cantonese restaurantsCrab Meat Tofu: this one is the most unique and I really enjoyed it for the rich, almost salted egg yolk like flavor. Hopefully, in terms of bold flavors, this would probably be the most ""bland"" for the night amongst the dishes. However, I really enjoyed the crab meats and the silky tofu hereEggplant and Minced Pork: super flavorful eggplants and meat sauce! A hit for everyone that nightHutaoli Fried Rice: ok for a fried rice this is really flavorful and goodHutaoli Roast Chicken: while it's not bad, the skin is fairly crispy, but some pieces of chicken were on the dry side. This is one of those dishes that would taste a little better, and is cheaper to order at Chinese restaurants (half crispy chicken) that's more succulentSpicy Dry Pot: all numbing spice and no flavor, not enough stuff in here, especially barely had any protein. Everyone's least favorite had to be this"

So there is a bit of a wait between getting seated and getting your order in. If you wanna order like a second round of food, good luck. Despite that experience with getting anyone to serve us, the restaurant had a great vibe. The singers are carefully selected and they sing some classics in both chinese and english. The food- everything was great and price is reasonable- I went two times and it came out to be around $30-$40 each time per person (before drinks). $30 is definitely worth it for the music, ambiance and good food"

They do have private rooms upstairs but there is a minimum spend if you do. If you reserve without specifying a room, I believe there is no minimum spend. The food was really good! We loved all the dishes we ordered- from the cabbage to the Mapo tofu to the roasted chicken. Everything was fresh and flavorful. The drink prices are what you'd expect in the city. I ordered the red wine sangria and the pina colada and enjoyed both. The service was a little slow though but the staff were all friendly and accommodating. They can even help bring the cake out with a light up birthday sign, which made the birthday person feel special. The restaurant's interior was also beautiful and open. They have live performances at night, which can get a little loud if you're sitting on the floor, but they're fun! Would definitely be an option I'd recommend for large group events near K-Town and Herald."
2744,kKdRGgLdzF-OCSpIftOTAA,3/14/2022,4 star rating,"Hutaoli is right by the Empire State and offers an elevated take on Szechuan cuisine. It gets pretty crowded at night so I'd recommend making a reservation online or call them. They were really accommodating to us changing our reservation and table size. The decor of the restaurant is really unique and it features live music and entertainment at night. The vibes skew towards a younger adult crowd I'd say.My group ordered a few dishes to share around the table. My favorites being Mapo Tofu ($19), Spicy Pork Belly with Crispy Garlic ($26) and the Fried Chopped Chicken ($22). The prices are on the higher side but considering it's midtown and you also get entertainment, I'd say the experience makes it worth it.TLDR: Come to Hutaoli if you're looking for a Szechuan restaurant to entertain a group."
2745,kKdRGgLdzF-OCSpIftOTAA,3/5/2022,5 star rating,"Hutaoli is a consistent vibe -- great upscale Szechuan food (they do not skimp on the peppercorn!), unreal decor, and live music at night. This is an ideal spot to bring tourist friends as a good time is guaranteed. If you're into dinnertime photoshoots, the restaurant is absolutely decked out w wall art, hanging plants, and just an absolute excess of interior decor. It's actually gorgeous.Food has always passed the test! Personal big fan of the eggplants, gluten and woodear mushrooms, fuqi feipian, and peanut cold chicken thing. They also have the silkiest mapo tofu dish you could even dream of. Drinks were a lil strong (except for my pina colada which barely tasted alcoholic.)"
2746,kKdRGgLdzF-OCSpIftOTAA,5/8/2022,4 star rating,"Went on a Friday night with my friend and ordered 3 dishes:- Hutaoli Roast Chicken (Half portion) - excellent, also liked the sweet and sour sauce - Crab Meat Tofu - super bland, would definitely not get this again- Longan Red Date Chicken Soup - delish, tastes like how grandma made it, perfect for the rainy weather. Only 1 serving though and the meats are small and bony.Decor is A+, feels like you're in China. We were a bit early for the music, which only started at 7pm. It was a solo guitarist, not the whole band, and everything was in Mandarin (word and song), except for the occasionally Happy Birthday song. Service is attentive; when you first order, they give you a pencil to circle your orders, so that there are no misunderstandings.Downsides:No rice is included in the dishes so you'll have to order white rice separately. No brown rice.Overall, solid Chinese place centrally located near Empire State and Koreatown. Great place to bring family and friends especially for birthdays and celebrations."

Either way, you'll remember the hanging plants, live music, and bright screens way longer than you'll remember the mediocre food. And that's pretty much what Mainland China wants from you.We got the Mapo Tofu, Fried Rice with Roe, and Mala Dry Pot. The dishes were generous in portion size, and not so generous in flavor size. The Mala was blander than my WASPy co-worker in Westchester. The Mapo lacked any sense of spiciness. The Fried Rice was decent but had nothing in it besides roe. They do give rather large pours of wine, so...maybe stick to that instead?The night we were there, there were sadly no interactive games, and the one live singer was singing mournful Chinese ballads that made me want to watch a Hallmark movie (or jump off a ledge). If you passed by NYC and missed coming here, don't fret--there's a million other locations around the world and in China."

I was in & out in less than 10 mins even though it was a little busy. I had the California Club sandwich. It was really good& fresh but just a little lacking in flavor. Can't wait to try the iced coffee & avocado toast for breakfast. It's in a really convenient location, right by the 6 on 33rd Street. It's nice & spacious enough to get work down/ chill out but either before or after the lunch rush as they tend to get a little packed."

I really enjoyed their oatmeal and turmeric latte. If I was feeling sassy, I would also grab one of their buttery, flaky croissants.Despite how busy it is on a work day, the staff is always friendly and helpful if you ask.I would also recommend their protein cups or salads for lunch. They are the perfect amount of food and calories for a person trying to eat better and healthier.This location is clean, but a little smaller than most other locations as far as I can tell. This can make navigating during rush hour somewhat challenging, but it's definitely worse battling the crowds to get a decent bit of food!I would recommend this location to anyone looking for something that isn't Starbucks, has decent coffee, and a great selection of breakfast and lunch items."

I like the bread you get with the soup too. Good quality ingredients, fresh and tasty. Portion sizes are just right so I don't feel like a total slug when I finish lunch and have to go back to work.This location is on the smaller side so there is a limited amount of seating at small circular tables.

This diner is by LaGuardia Community College and unfortunately there aren't that many restaurants in the area. I was really hesitate to try this place because of the reviews but we gave it a chance anyway. We came in and were told we can sit anywhere. The diner itself has a classic look. The breakfast items we got were pretty ok. I was most shocked by the waffle because it was so fluffy and delicious. I've been to fancy restaurants and they couldn't get a waffle right. They should put the half & half creamers on a plate then just leaving it on the tables. The syrup were the packet ones, I think they can get proper syrup for the tables.

Consistent, quality food at affordable prices, with a can-do attitude and timely delivery make this operation as smooth as they come. There were little to no expectations when I first dined here, but I've managed to become a loyal customer.Vam Dam Diner is undeniably old school but in the best way. The interior is what one would expect of any old diner - minimal decor, antiquated aura, older staff, and perhaps at prices that may never change. Is it the perfect diner? Depending on who you're asking, perhaps the answer is yes.From the occasional burger to the always tuna melt, VDD excels in a number of items. Breakfast seems to be their greatest feat. Eggs are cooked perfectly, as is the corn beefed hash, and they even offer mutl-grain bread with no extra charge. Even the home fries are solid ... and I typically hate home fries.The one knock on VDD is that they close a little early, but I suppose that's the price of quality. Happy gem seeking LIC'ers will most certainly find one in Van Dam Diner."

I usually have the burger and fries here when I come. The burger isn't made with a freezer patty but actually real meat. It tastes quite delicious. Something I'd eat everyone once in a while.

Everything tasted delicious, but I was especially impressed by 1) the awesome bread on the sandwich (apparently it comes daily from a bakery across the street) and 2) the assortment and freshness of the veggies in the salad - not what I expected from a salad at a bar. The only part I didn't love was how loud it was, but I'm sure it was packed because everyone knew how good the food and service is, and at a reasonable price.

Turned out the guy pouring drinks was Nole the owner of the establishment. Great guy with awesome stories about Ireland. That day Nole talked me into having the grilled cheese. I was thinking, ""Why would I want a grilled cheese""?But I agreed to have it and it turned out to be the best grilled cheese I ever had. It was made with Irish Kerrygold cheddar and Irish bacon on texas toast. I thought about that simple sandwich many times throughout the year. We were looking to have that same great experience this year at Walter's after the CurveNY show. It happened to be Nole's day off so that was disappointing to not have that same great conversation with him.I figured I would try something other than a grilled cheese this year. I ordered the Irish Onion Soup, which was very good. I also had a corned beef reuben sandwich. It was just average...nothing special. My wife ordered the steak sandwich. It was so small, we thought it was a half sandwich. Very little meat inside and she said the meat didn't taste that good. So she ended up just eating her fries.My sister in law had the bangers and mash. She said it was just ok. If we do go back to Walter's, it would most likely be for drinks and hopefully to see Nole again. We'll pass on the food."

2779,pPqEu60FMffpiWqk2MCrVA,3/22/2017,5 star rating,"Excellent neighborhood bar/ restaurant.  It was late on a Tuesday and quite busy.  The area has many Irish style bars to choose from, but most no longer have that old time feel to them.  They tend to look more like Wall Street hang-outs or massive, elaborate corporate sports bars with 20 huge flat screen TVs.  Besides, if you are over 25 years old, it just no longer feels very comfortable in those places. Walter's Cottage is different. It's not that the requisite multiple flat screens with various games are not prominently displayed, or the groups of shouting 20s year old folks are missing, because they are not. But, everyone feels welcome. Of course, it always starts with the attitude of the servers, and Tom was great. I was looking for a dinner of fish and chips, but they had many orders already.  Tom suggested that I take a seat at the bar and have a drink if I cared to wait, which was fine with me. They have Wi-fi that I used, and several games that I watch. After I finished a well made mixed drink, a huge plate of delicious fish and chips was put in front of me. The fish was very fresh and moist, without that greasiness found in most deep fried fish dishes.  It had a light, puffed up crusty coating that was perfect, and white firm fish that flaked apart, as if it was actually baked and not deep fried, at all. I will be back for a meal, a drink, or just to relax and watch a game."

She knows her stuff and I mean she knows everyone that comes in the door and knows how to have their drink iced down or a drink on it's way. It's like Norm coming home to Cheers. Good good solid food. We both had the Walters Burget with Irish Cheddar and Irish bacon with fries. Combine that with a gin and tonic it didn't get much better.. UNTIL one of the patrons walked in and sat down. Just good people at this place. Can't wait to return.

Go in grab what you like there and go. That's what most people do- Not everything is delicious but some of their food will hold you down a random afternoon.1) The chicken selection is delicious. 2) Not particularly found of the rice.3) Pick the Lo Mein in lieu of the rice if you want carbs.4) The cornbread is a good little treat.All in all they're not the best- but they're ok."

The last few times I've been in I couldnt really tell if there was an actual manager or just a few rogue employees who could care less about taking care of guests. And it seems, like many other establishments, they haven't found a way to fulfill the increase in delivery orders while taking care of guests that are actually in the restaurant. I should probably just cook more is my conclusion. Especially if I have to wait 4 mins to order fast food when there is no line. Just 3 employees on one door dash order. And finally I'm exhausted with business establishments choosing to close hours before their actually closing time. It was 11pm and the guy had shut down the kitchen and was only serving something pre made. Why should a paying guest have to make concessions when spending money. Perhaps I'm asking too much of Checkers then again I'm certain these things are pretty basic when running a business."

We shared the garlic bread, chickpea-flour pancakes, anchovies and boquerones, and chicken liver pâté toast. Everything was alright, but I found the chicken liver pâté to be the most disappointing as it tasted a bit bitter with the liver taste not masked/disguised at all, but I guess that's consistent with their healthy and natural concept for food? It also didn't really pair well with the strawberries even though they looked photogenic together. Regardless, I expected a bit more from a gourmet restaurant like this to at least attempt at elevating a dish like pâté, otherwise it'd just be the definition of ""overpriced.""

It was like being relegated to the kids table or something. When you have reservations months in advance, that sucks...kind of criminal. Our server was nice enough. She told my daughter they didn't have hot cider, despite it being listed plainly on the drink menu. I mean, no big deal. But kind of not nice for a kid. Especially when they're already sitting at the kids table. The first course involved a serving of biscuits. We each got one small one. They were scrumptious. But then we waited 20 minutes for the soup. No joke. We watched others around us who were seated after us get served well before us. We started to feel like maybe it was us. Our server was too busy yaking it up with other tables to notice. My kids didn't want me to make a scene. Blah blah blah. Finally she came by. And clearly they had effed up. Just forgot about us.  the rest of the meal was good. Mashed potatoes some of the best I've ever had. Loved the Turkey - dark and white. Stuffing was delish. Deserts were lovely; but again, so chintzy on the serving size. Like embarrassingly so - esp the apple tart. And then wine pairing? From the finger lakes...I mean, come on. It was an economically priced pairing, but still. I wouldn't mind trying Hearth again for one of their normal menus. As long as they promised to sit me in the adults room and they weren't charging me an arm and a leg for a mediocre prix fixe. Still mad about that soup."
2799,VDSZaMS5Xs4IWiGf5razSA,4/21/2022,3 star rating,"This was super disappointing, I saw tons of good reviews but my food was mediocre. I wasn't blown away by anything we ordered (fava bean soup, maccheroni, meatballs, cacio e pepe polenta). The polenta was my favorite dish of what we ordered. It was difficult to get refilled water for the table. There was no parking but I think there was a school event nearby so plan accordingly."

The food, however, was incredibly overpriced for what it was. The portions (we had cod and steak) are laughably small; entrees come in appetizer size."
2801,VDSZaMS5Xs4IWiGf5razSA,12/22/2020,5 star rating,"This place has been on my radar for awhile now and when I had my birthday off at work, I wasn't sure where to go. I ended up rediscovering this restaurant on my list and am SO GLAD I was able to stop in to try some of their dishes.Since this is pandemic-times, I'll start with the outdoor seating. It's great! It's sectioned off like a patio with enough coverage to keep you warm. They also had a heater that I opted not to use, as it was a hot day.Ok, now the good stuff-The server advised to start with the bread and seasonings on it. (I can't remember the specific name, but I included pictures.) Holy moly this was DELISH. It was warm and perfectly seasoned. I needed to stop myself from eating the whole thing so I could save room for the main!The main I went for was the whole grain maccheroni- it felt like I was eating mom's cooking. Very comforting, filling and with the perfect amount of whipped ricotta to lighten it. Lastly, I sprang for the dark chocolate budno as a treat. This was very rich and good,  but not really my style. I think I want to try their cookies next time.Overall, I was very happy with my birthday meal and thought the service was top-notch.5/5"
2802,VDSZaMS5Xs4IWiGf5razSA,12/15/2020,4 star rating,"My friend and I had reservations for Sunday brunch during COVID and were seated promptly upon arrival.  Their partially enclosed outdoor space was warmed by space heaters, but felt just a little too cozy; there were only two tables in the area we were seated, and because of the partial enclosure and lack of music outdoors, we could hear the other patron's conversations clear as a bell.  In turn, we kept our voices down the whole time so as not to bother them.  This is, of course, not the fault of the restaurant; but just note that if you're looking for a lively brunch spot to hit up with more than 2 people during COVID, Hearth is probably not it to for you.Food and drinks were great!  Their brunch menu does not include your standard eggs and pancake dishes; the menu is largely Italian-themed.  We started with warm sourdough bread ($7), which was chewy on the outside but soft on the inside, and great with the butter.  For my entree, I had the meatballs ($23), which were tasty, but absurdly priced for 2 meatballs.  My friend had the ribollita with poached eggs ($17), which she enjoyed.  I also had a hot cocktail ($15) which was nice on a cold day.Overall, Hearth is a decent option for brunch, especially if you're looking for something a little different."

It appeared closed but the guy let us in and get our yogurt. That was really nice of him. It is a self-serve, so there aren't any complaints. Nothing much more to say about this place. I do recommend to others"

This location is conveniently located on Bell Blvd, close to many stores and restaurants. I've come here many times for dessert after dinner at a restaurant nearby. It's very well maintained and clean inside. They alternate one or two of the flavors every once in awhile. I love getting my usual pomegranate, coconut or peanut butter flavors."

2810,7Yw9KGq1y9L-bRD9kOq2nw,11/25/2018,4 star rating,"This is my favorite Red Mango location. The workers are always nice, no matter when I stop by. The self serve machines free up time for the person behind the counter to do other things. I've stopped by a lot of Red Mango locations throughout the city and Long Island, and I've gotta say, TARO is a gosh darn difficult flavor to track down. Besides seeing it at the Ktown location, this may be the only other location I've seen it. And then I begin to wonder.. why is that? Do people not know what taro is? Are they scared of it? Do they fear things that are purple? With the self serve machine.. I can take all the Taro I want!! It's fabulous! If you stop by on a weeknight during the school year this place is pretty much empty. Know when to show up to avoid the crowds. I have also had Red Mango gift card issues (there is a value on my gift card, however using it seems to be an issue when I try to use it). I have gone to a few locations and the person ringing me up said the card reader wasn't working, the gift card wasn't working (the gift card number is right there on the card but it still did not show a balance.. etc).. and this location was the only one who had workers who were able to get the balance to show without any issue! I love the frozen yogurt, but will stay away from buying any gift cards in the future. I even looked into having my gift card replaced, which according to the website, would require proof of purchase (ha, it was a gift card, no gift receipt) with the card mailed in to Red Mango corporate in order for them to issue me a new one. That seems like an awful hassle to get $18 back.When you are swirling and adding your own toppings, it is easy to go overboard with all the options. Know what you want and keep it simple if you don't want to overpay for a treat. I once filled it up not realizing that it was close to $11. Good thing I had my Red Mango promotions loaded onto my loyalty card! And best of all, during your birthday month they load your card with $5 coupon!Street parking is available if you know where to look. There are residential streets a few blocks away, or you can park in the Bayside municipal lot (city owned) a few blocks away. Very accessible by bus, as well. Finding a Red Mango is becoming more difficult as the years go by. The Flushing location closed down and the Fresh Meadows one was closed for a while. Let's keep this location open!"

First and foremost, the portions were huge and more than adequate. As for the actual chicken, it was well seasoned but a little on the dryer and so definitely use the maple syrup that they give you.  The waffles, however, were easily some of the best waffles that I've ever had.  If I could purchase a to-go packet of them, I would in a heartbeat."

We showed up a few minutes before they opened up with a reservation and they sat us right away. A long like was starting to form, and pretty soon after all the restaurant was full. I consider myself lucky, but next time I'll be sure to make reservations. My wife ordered their Pecan Pie French toast and I ordered their short rib hash. The French toast were really tasty. They were thick and were really sweet. Perfect for anyone who has a sweet tooth in the morning. It came with bourbon, molasses and roasted Pecans. My short rib has came with two sunny side up eggs, toast and a small side salad. The rib hash was cooked perfectly and they give you plenty of meat mixed in with potatoes and carrots. It was a good dish but I would most likely order something else next time I'm in town. Overall, the staff was great and very welcoming. I would definitely be returning during my next visit."

My girls and I got the Eggs Huntington, Fried chicken sandwich, Short Rib Hash and the ABC Grilled Cheese sandwich. My fave was definitely the fried chicken sandwich and the eggs Huntington!!The eggs Huntington was made beautifully. The eggs were perfectly poached and runny. The smoked ham was decadent. The buttermilk biscuits tasted great, but was slightly dry. But with the runny eggs, it was fine! The short rib hash had a lot more beef than the potatoes. I typically like a good mix for a hash, but it was good! The short rib was spot on flavor, but a bit dry. The hot sauce they give definitely helps! The fried chicken was crunchy, flavorful and soooo juicy!! Def recommend. Sticky buns were really good in flavor. The inside was warm and fluffy but the outside was a bit hard and dry."

2818,nDiB5GU653RzK3X2CBG14w,9/10/2022,4 star rating,I've been going to this place for many years. A lot of the things that I realize that I've changed is the price of the pop overs. The pop overs used to be free then it was four dollars and now it is seven for simply three. The fried chicken tasted the same but it definitely needed to be a little More brown and crispy. The mashed potatoes were lovely fluffy and creamy as per usual.

The space itself is quite lovely and has a nice outdoor seating area with umbrellas as well as a generous indoor seating area. We both ordered drinks; a Bellini for my friend and a mimosa for myself. I got the ABC grilled cheese minus the bacon and my friend got the pecan pie French toast and both were delicious. I would definitely come here again as the food and service were great!

Apparently well known for brunch, the place was packed inside, so thank you for also having a covid-19 free outdoor option.From the beginning of service to the end, my party of three was thoroughly satisfied. I selected for my mom the fried pork. And OMG wish I ordered ut for myself! When I tell you crunchy and flavorful on the outside, tender and more flavor on the inside... kudos to the chef! In all my dining escapades, this was hands down THE BESTESTESTEST Fried Pork I have had the pleasure of consuming! The waffles had to have hit the spot cause my mom finished it ALL... a rarity. I had the chicken sandwich. I had the opportunity to peep into the kitchen and saw the freshly done chicken staring at me - calling my name. Had to have it. And it did not disappoint. I am not much on restaurant cole slaw, but this version came as close to my kitchen as it could get - not a piece of cabbage remained in the bowl. Even the grilled onions were delectable all by its lonesome (grammatically incorrect). The fries were salted (not my thing but I did forget to ask for unsalted fries). That aside, they were truly crispy right out the pot.My Yelp buddy, Minah, got the Eggs benedict which she said was very nicely done. I can only reiterate her sentiment. The leftovers - cause it was sooo much food, great bang for the buck - did not stand a chance. I don't think it lasted more than 15 minutes after getting home.So yes, I plan a revisit... soon... before it gets too cold to dine outside."

Waiters were attentive and checked frequently to refill water. Our desert (tiramisu and chocolate souffle) were deliciousMinus side: We thought the dipping sauce that came with the bread was tomato. But it turned out to be red pepper! Two people in our party couldn't eat spicy food and that sauce surprised both of them. Moreover, my linguini pasta with fresh clams was far too salty. I think the cook forgot that clam is saltwater seafood and they should not put so much salt in the pasta that it overburdens the dish.Verdict: Yelppers let me down and I would try another restaurant next time."

However, please note that if you are celebrating someone's birthday here, they have an exorbitant charge for bringing in outside cake and are not likely to give a free dessert."

Waiters were very attentive and cognizant of allergies which was appreciated.I got the gnocchi which was superb. It came in a sauce that was a little, rich, little creamy, but super flavorful. Probably like a white wine butter sauce. The only negative thing I'd say is this: one of my colleagues asked for some advice on which pasta option to get and the waiter literally said every pasta option. Not helpful. Better off providing some actual advice rather than just relisting everything."

I got a small mocha with almond milk and it came out to $6. The price listed was $4.50 so that must mean almond milk is $1.50. That alone threw me off because never have I ever paid more than 75 cents for a vegan substitute. At this point I knew that odds are, I wouldn't be returning due to the price. I was still *open* to coming back though, if the coffee's quality lived up to the price. To say the least, I was disappointed. The coffee was watered down and had little flavor. The only props I give is that it was frothy. Again, like.... who charges $1.50 for almond milk?"

Doesn't taste lavender-y at all. And my mouth is starting to feel weird - like an allergic reaction or irritation. Walked in and was barely greeted. One barista was eating behind the bar. One was holding their money. The latter didn't wash their hands after handling money & before making my drink. The sanitary level here def didn't make me comfortable.

JahahahaAnyways, the girl was really nice & laid back, very accommodating.  We also order the spinach quish & cheese croissant, both fresh & good.  I'll be back when I'm in NY but my Fam will be their soon!"

It was a little sweeter than I'm used to back in SF, but it had a pleasant flavor and the portion was very generous. My friend got some tea and 2 cookies - I sampled the red velvet cookie, which was delicious (very nice cream cheese center).Based on the food, I'd give it a solid 4 stars, but the vibe bumps it up to a 5. I absolutely loved the outdoor seating in the back: stylish and really well designed. If I lived in the area, this would be my neighborhood coffee shop."

The back patio is well designed and offers the flexibility for both sitting in the sun or shade. Plenty of comfortable seating throughout the shop, good option for both, individuals and groups. During my visit, there was Spanish music playing in the background. It wasn't too loud and became white noise after few minutes of being there. I ordered the cold brew - black (5.99$). It was a bit watered down but I am too charmed by the location to complaint. This is definitely a place I would visit again. Great option for work or doing some light reading."

Maybe I've just had bad luck every one of the 5-6 times I've been here.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯The food is good, but RIDICULOUSLY overpriced (it's not THAT good). Especially on a street with an abundance of amazing food, drink and coffee options (and many, many more options within walking distance...Astoria is well known as one of the best neighborhoods in NYC for food and drink). Hey, I'll happily pay top dollar when it's worth it, but this almost feels like some kind of weird social experiment.The baristas are generally friendly in my experience. The space and decor is cute. The ambience reminds me of circa 2005 coffee shops when it was sooo coool to bring your laptop to the cafe and ""work"". Cocktails are good but again nothing mind-blowing and you could have an equally good (or better) one a few steps down the street for $5 less.Their hours are different depending on whether you check Yelp, Google, their website etc. Uber Eats shows them as open until 2am or something, but I have never physically seen the place open at night. Again maybe I'm unlucky.Honestly, it's really the decor, ambience and the indoor-outdoor area that makes the spot stand out a bit, but most passerbys wouldn't even know about the back area.If they had a BYO-Food and BYO-Coffee option, I'd probably much rather pay $20 just to chill there for a couple of hours while consuming better quality (and value) food and drinks from other nearby spots."

2886,Vu3YWBTA6ygLq2RweWZM8Q,3/19/2022,3 star rating,"2 Bros Pizza is a local chain of dollar pizza places, located on the corner of 25th St and Sixth Avenue. the space is smallish but relatively clean given the amount Tor foot traffic. there are a variety of pies and slices on display. there are tables to stand at and some seats outside. this is very much a grab-n-go. stopped by here for a quick bite as i was running errands in Chelsea and 2 Bros is perfect for fast eats. the dollar slices are good for dollar slices in NYC but compared to regular slice joints...the pizza is fairly average. the slices have medium-ish soft crusts, the sauce is a bit sweet, and the cheese is a melty blanket. again, the pizza is quite average but solid for when you need calories in a saucy, carb-y, and cheesy package. staff moves fast and cool. drops mic cuz all pizza aren't created equali outzzz"

For a minute I think they switched to $1.50 but I noticed after I came back to Chelsea slightly inebriated after a 3 year-old's birthday that they changed the prices back to $1. That's right, folks. It's still just a dollar for a cheese slice and I was like hey - maybe I should get one because it's only Wednesday. At least, it was a dollar that night and for now. Hoping it doesn't change. It was delicious and tasty as hell as usual. I panicked for a moment because these two girls in line ahead of me ordered 5 slices to go and that took the remainder of the entire pie and I was thinking to myself 'you fat asses couldn't just save me 1 measly slice, and now I'm going to have to wait 15 minutes for another pie to cook up'. Nope! They had shelves of steaming hot pies on these heating trays behind the counter. They know. Fresh pie cut up just for me. It was a wonderful moment."

Right around the corner from my hotel was this place. I saw a bunch of people coming and going and it was quite late. In the middle of the buzzle was a crew of Hispanic men, making pizza fresh and right on the spot. It was fantastic. Not too expensive and you feel like a life long New Yorker.

I still can't put my finger on why exactly it tasted as good as it did, but it was perfectly balanced - not too acidic, not too salty, not too much of any seasoning, just perfect. I would even buy the sauce if they sold it in jars. The server made a recommendation of sautéed calamari for an appetizer which was very tender and surprisingly flavorful and the baked eggplant appetizer was also good. Gluten-free pizza is not available but there are GF pasta options, which is a win for anyone who has to eat GF. I also didn't experience any cross-contamination issues, which was a very big plus for me."

If you order anything else off the menu it seems to be a complete miss. The gnocchi had no flavor, the stuffed eggplant with crabmeat tasted fishy , and over salted to compensate for the old fish. Tonight I attempted again to order something else off the menu , the shrimp entree for $22 I got 4 pieces of shrimp and 2 pieces of broccoli, the shrimp was chewy. On top of that they forgot the pizza i ordered and had to wait for the pizza to arrive to eat. My other food got cold. When I called to complain a nasty waiter pretty much stated it's not our fault the delivery guy forgot the pizza. How about you take liability in your customer service instead of blaming someone else. Anyway will not be ordering from this place again."

In this case, shrinking quantity, reducing quality all while paying a premium price. My guests ended up rationing the meals (plural) that we thought would be more then enough.

First, we started with a bottle of Pinot noir, which was tasteful and the temperature of the wine was just right. For apps, we ordered the grilled calamari and fresh mozzarella with prosciutto which was really fresh and delicious. For main course, we had the beet salad with shrimp and chefs Salmon which was flavorful! We then finished off the night with cappuccinos and a tasty tiramisu to share.

They treat every patron like they are their only and favorite client. They make you feel festive and joy. They are attentive enough and can bring good short conversations to the table. But the food is what really puts you in the mood to celebrate. This is NYC and it is hard to compete with Italian restaurants here because there are so many options, but I say drive out of your way to come here. You will enjoy the experience."

The vibe was absolutely perfect, and we are still getting compliments from our guests about the food & drinks!From the beginning, Tom & his crew did a wonderful job of helping us to envision the space and the flow of the event. They worked with us to co-create the perfect evening, complete with a customized menu and schedule. They set the room up exactly the way we wanted it, making sure the space would be able to accommodate the needs of our party (we had approximately 100 people). On the day of, everything ran smoothly, everyone had an amazing time, and the staff was extremely helpful in addressing any/all concerns that popped up.GRECA comes equipped with a DJ booth, a microphone, and audio-visual equipment to support a customized photo slideshow. GRECA's location in Tribeca near the water also makes it an ideal place to take photos before the main event. If I had it to do all over again, I would pick GRECA as my wedding venue every time! 5/5 would recommend!"

Overall the meal was okay, we got two salads, one with chicken and some chips and guac. The chips and guac were quite basic and very average, the salads slightly better. The service was fine. The entire time we sat next to trashy 15 year old girls who spent the entire meal face timing with their boyfriends and talking about whether ""just the tip"" ""counts"" and how drunk they got last night. I wouldn't have written a review, but when I saw the bill came out to $68, that was just too much not to post on yelp about it."

SHE THRIVES ON ABUSE.Isn't it VERY sad to know that there are employees who DO NOT KNOW or underSTAND how to serve or respect customers?

There really is nothing all that alluring about Analogue other than it's a decent neighborhood spot with a fair amount of space. But again, the 'doorman' - acting as if he's working the line at The Limelight in 1993. If you're unsure who I'm referring to, look for the older guy with the horrible attitude who makes it seem like he's doing you a favor patronizing the bar. There are too many newer, cooler and more fun spots that value a customer and are far more accommodating than the ""host"" here. Having lived in the city for a long time AND staying put during the pandemic mainly to help local businesses, time is too short to go somewhere that employs someone like this, who doesn't remotely get it.

One funny and bonus story: the bathroom's door in the back of bar is pretty weird, you really have to pull it hard. I tried it once and thought someone was in there and I was waiting for almost 10 minutes --I even asked the staff to check if the person in there is ok lol-- but turns out you just need to pull the door harder, so pull it harder my friend lol"

When I told him that, he said I was lying...so yeah just a treat and a half at front of house. It wouldn't have been such a big deal (totally fair if there was a miscommunication and they need to ask us to adjust) but he jumped to aggressive accusations immediately.I was especially sad to have had such a bad experience because we often ordered from this bar and had become friends with some of the team during lockdown and have enjoyed and recommended it since. We had honestly booked this group there less for the drinks which are fine but more to further support them; Never again. It was just dealing with someone on a power trip for no reason. A shame to see this spot lose its charm like this because of one person.We went down the block to the new Mr. Capri and had an incredible time with the NICEST people. The cocktails were phenomenal; highly rec their Le Sirene: Gin martini, anchovie oil, butter and breadcrumbs. We ended up wrapping our evening with some lovely shots with the bar staff there.

I've been twice and both times they've been pretty packed but I was still lucky enough to get a table right away. The drinks are pretty pricey in my opinion but they're really good, so you're definitely there for the vibes. It's dark, it's kinda loud but you can still have a conversation with friends or a date, and the couches are comfy. You end up spending $25 just for one drink and they kind of shoo you after you're done, but I guess that could be normal for a nice cocktail bar maybe idk. They have really tasty espresso martinis and their Be Different, Be Damned drink is really good if you like fruity drinks. Unclear if their espresso martinis actually have espresso in it, because it didn't list espresso in the ingredients in the menu but the server was kinda like of course it does  so I felt like a loser for asking, but some places don't actually use real espresso. Also when I tried my friends' espresso martinis it didn't taste like there was espresso in it and they didn't feel the caffeine, so someone please let me know."

I try my best to get their dim sum here at least once a week. My favorite items are the beef rice noodle and their steamed bbq pork buns. They're tasty and is filled with fillings. For lunch, I normally get their bbq pork and roasted duck over rice. I think that they have the best bbq pork and duck in the area. The only thing that I wouldn't recommend is their baked buns. I think they only make one batch in the early morning and It just sits there. If you're coming here for food, your best bet is to get their hot foods."

Dim sum is really whatever you want to make of it though, as Chen Won and countless other small places prove.Eating here in the morning, on a weekday or weekend, is probably the equivalent of taking your meal in a small, sleepy provincial town rather than the big city. It is a much more relaxed and friendly experience, even if some of the items are a bit less delicious and/or fresh.The steamed rice roll with shrimp ($2.25) and steamed shrimp dumplings ($2.25) are both passable like their brethren in the big halls. As a lady came in and handed the owner $260 for a large order of dim sum to take to an event she must have been organizing, we plopped these into our mouths to get started.Usually one of my favorite items, the turnip cake ($2) was unusually unsavory, possibly because it was made yesterday or the day before. I have the impression that a few of the items here might suffer from this, so take a look at things before you open and dig in. They are definitely not going to be as fresh as the places cranking out hundreds of each everyday, like Pacificana in Sunset Park. The large steamed pork buns (not pictured) also seemed old.All of that being said, one thing definitely knocked our socks off, and that was the tangyuan soup, which does not seem to exist on the menu but should definitely be asked for. This version had plenty of turnip to go with the glutinous rice flour balls and pork, and all combined to make a delicious warm counterpoint to the cold air outside.There are only three four-person tables here, so most people are coming in to grab some items to take home. We asked a kind gentlemen enjoying some tea if we could share with him, and he immediately gathered up his newspaper to make room and made sure we were happy with our meal and even started making suggestions. It was something that you definitely could not imagine happening in one of the crowded places in Manhattan's Chinatown."

I thought it was just my party, but time and time again, people entered and were seated without checking vaccination status (minus 1 star). (This is a requirement in our state, and can lead to indoor dining shutdowns if establishments don't follow it). It also didn't help, that a patron beside me maintained an intermittent cough throughout her meal. Service initially was pleasant, but after they take you're order service is pretty non-existent. On multiple occasions, either my friend or myself had to gain the attention a passing waiter. At one point, when I attempted to gain the attention of a waiter--he appeared annoyed (minus 1 star).With regards to food, appetizers were egg drop soup (my friend said it was really tasty), and shrimp dumplings (the winner!).

If you like or are like me and love truffle french fries, this is a MUST.  The taro adds a nice complexity of crunch and flavor. Since taro is not as sweet as potato the blend of truffle and parmesan cheese is a winning combination.- Coconut shrimp: Very well fried and taste. The shrimp are extra large so don't be surprised that there are only 5. The side sauce was good, but we preferred the shrimp without.- Spam Musubi: One of a friends ordered the spam sushi as we would call it.  I was surprised by how much I like this.  Note that I have never had spam previously.  The combination of sweet and salty was quite good!- For entrees we had the breakfast tacos and the cinnamon toast brunch.  If you're looking for a dish filled with flavors, I would recommend that you do not order the breakfast tacos.  While they were good, in comparison to the other dishes, it was boring and lacked a combination of flavors that hit your taste buds hard.  The cinnamon toast brunch on the other hand was amazing.  The name was spot on and it was like eating cinnamon toast cereal, bringing back childhood memories.Drinks:- Margaritas are A+++, excellent flavor and a heavy pour of tequila.  They also made the wife a mango mocktail which was delicious!Atmosphere:- The atmosphere inside is fun. It makes you feel as though you've stepped outside of the city and have a trendy vibe with an island feel.- Outside is great; spacious and covered!Service:- Our server was perfect. Our friends were 1.5 hours late to brunch (luckily it wasn't terribly crowded) and our server made us feel welcomed and assured us we could stay as long as we wanted.  We ordered a bunch of drinks and appetizers while waiting too.- Server was attentive but not overwhelming and checked in us at appropriate frequencies.Overall, we recommend The Highwater and would come back.  If you're looking for a place to have some great drinks and small bites, this place is an easy choice."

We were coming from brunch, but looked like they have a pretty popular unlimited brunch here (and from the photos, a drag brunch sometimes!). Had some really great (and strong) cocktails at the bar.I had The Outlaw (bourbon/mezcal with pineapple and jalapeno), and the Flames of Twilight (mezcal, tequila, sherry). Ok, looking back on the day, I can see how I got so drunk. Both drinks were very good, but The Outlaw was my favorite. Perfectly balanced, but still in your face.I also got to try the Die Another Day (which is probably one of their more photogenic drinks). Bartender was telling us she gets the most random phrases for that when people forget the name.Since we just came from brunch, didn't have any of their substantial bites, but did get some chips and guac. The guac was super fresh!This place is deffo a vibe."
2963,igbXdpEil8ZTcridxpBlLg,2/17/2023,5 star rating,"Had a midweek dinner date here and OMG the food was amazing!!!The Kalua pork dinner plate was absolutely phenomenal. The pork was so tender and moist while the coleslaw and macaroni salad balanced it all. The katsu sauce was too sweet for my liking but it was fine because I ate every bite with rice. I would 100% order this again. The friend chicken sandwich is to die for. The chicken was moist and crunchy. The Siracha honey ranch sauce was sweet, very slightly spicy, and tangy. It was one of the best chicken sandwiches we had in a long time. The taro fries were so crispy and not oily at all. Whether you love or hate ranch, the truffle ranch sauce that comes with the fries is delicious. The truffle flavor is very forward. Would 100% order again!We ordered the lemonade and passion fruit juice which was fresh and slightly sour, which we preferred since our food was rich. The restaurant was not extremely busy, the music was not loud, and the general vibe was beachy and relaxing. The staff did a great job refilling our waters and checking in with us. I see it as a great spot for either happy hour or a date! We look forward to visiting again soon."
2964,igbXdpEil8ZTcridxpBlLg,3/14/2022,3 star rating,A friend and I had dinner and wanted to finish catching up over a cocktail. It was a Tuesday night and we saw the reviews on Yelp so we decided to come here. This place was packed and the seating was very close to other tables. They have drink specials (margaritas) and taco specials for Taco Tuesday (I think they were $3 or $3.50 per taco). We didn't have any food b/c we'd just ate but we did have a few drinks. The drinks were okay. I was expecting a better margaritas based on the other reviews but maybe I'll have to come back on another Tuesday and try the tacos. I applaud the staff for keeping up with the crowd and making sure everyone got their drinks in a timely manner. Our waitress was super friendly. It seems like a cute local spot. I'll give it another go when I'm back in Astoria.

I used to live a little closer to this spot so it would be my go-to for my roommate and I or whenever a friend was visiting the area. It's unique, themed and delicious! Everything from their cocktails, summer drinks/specials, food menu and the whole theme of the restaurant is such a crowd pleaser.I've probably gotten the spam musubi every time I dined here. And maybe takeout too. It's criminal not to get...!I've also tried the truffle taro fries, fish tacos, poke bowl and a couple others. All phenomenal and fabulous.A must-try in Astoria!"

Its very lay back and has this great feel about it upon entering. I came for a random taco Tuesday and was delighted by it all. The margaritas are so good and hit so well! The staff is so kind and attentive which was a huge plus! I think The only thing that I was bummed about were the tacos. They kinda lacked. The ingredients were very refreshing and the notes of different tastes mixed so well But I just found myself wanting more from the taco; some felt a bit unfinished and others lacked a WOW factor. But Overall, I would come back and try other tacos and order more then 2 margaritas lol a must try!"

It's a great happy hour spot, with good vibes and ambiance. I enjoyed their themed tiki cocktails, which was the highlight of my experience here. The food was okay to me. I only tried their Spam musubis and ahi tuna tacos, as shareable plates for the table. The ahi tuna tacos were great bite-sized appetizers I recommend. The Spam musubis you can never go wrong, for such a simple comfort food. My only complaint is the rice to spam ratio is too damn high! It was like a sliver of spam atop a giant pile of rice. I'll admit I am biased since I've homemade musubis myself, so I would obviously want a thicker slice of Spam.Overall, this is a unique spot in Astoria I'd recommend anyone to drop by during Happy Hour. I would visit again to try their pork dishes =)"

Yes, I know rice and beans are nothing special but when prepared the right way it's heaven. I've had overcooked rice and bland beans in other places so it's nice to see that Caribe got it right!Secondly, the cerdo frita is so good it makes my eyes roll back!!

The barista was mixing up all the hot and iced orders. Another woman wanted an iced drink and received a hot one. But I still took it anyway, because I didn't have time to wait for her to make a new one and I was ok with the change. The staff is not the usual friendly Starbucks staff I'm accustomed to. It's so weird. Walk one or 2 blocks down to the other Starbucks on 125th street and it's like a different world. Perhaps, this locations needs a remodel?

Sometimes that help with the wait process. Grows: If you're an early morning chick like me. Don't expect them to be open at 6am. Try getting there around 6:30am. It's never open on-time.

I don't know who owns this establishment but they need to close this down.  Be prepared to wait. They are all inefficient and the drive thru is a 45 minutes wait!

I've been sitting in this line most of my life; there is nothing fast about this fast food as in never ever have I been to a fast food restaurant that takes this long. Only two cars right in front of me and I've been waiting almost an hour, and nowhere near getting my food. It's definitely messed up with this place; save yourself the time and go elsewhere.

Also every time that I finally do get my food it's always wrong or something is missing the experience is so bad that I rather just lose the money and the food because the service is just that mediocre. It doesn't make a difference going into the restaurant either because it's even worse the employees all have a nasty attitude and are dismissive of everything, if they hate their jobs so much just quit there's unemployment for everyone and it's lenient. If you want Wendy's don't go here because by the time you get your food and experience this hell on earth you won't even want to eat the food."

My buddy lives close by and I've spent a few Sundays here watching football before heading off to the airport.  Grey Bar is somewhat of a hybrid, in that the ambience is more chic than your average sports bar, yet is still primarily catered towards sports (football) fans. Most people were tuned into the NYC teams, not surprisingly. However, the crowd was mostly non-partisan and people were cheering for a variety of teamsThere are plenty of TVs, the atmosphere is modern and clean. The few times I've been, they accommodated our parties of 5-6 easily. They never seem too crowded on Sundays, which is a big draw of the restaurant. The food here is better than average. Being able to eat a decent brunch while watching Sunday football is another draw of Grey Bar. Like others have mentioned, I would avoid the guacamole. However, everything else i've tried has been good. This includes the Buffalo chicken sliders and the pizzas. I tried my friend's strawberry-banana pancakes, which were good as well. They have a pretty good selection of draft beer and wine. I did not enjoy my Bloody Mary though, but that could be bartender dependent."

I'm not sure if this place is typically a sports bar, but it felt like just that -- and while I didn't intend on being there to watch sports, it offers a great setup to do just that: plenty of space, big screen TVs, loud speakers broadcasting the game, etc. If you're looking for a quiet place to catch up with friends, I'd avoid this place because it can get loud - but if you're looking for a spot to watch a game, this place is great.

Nice candles on each table, cool decor and awesome lights. They have these clusters of dim lights in the front and the back which is very unique. As for the bar, the selection is great! Bar has at least ten feet of liquor and the mixed drink menu looked good even though I did not try anything from it.Waitstaff was very kind and seemed engaged the whole time.

Shame, Shame, Shame. Forgot how many drinks and snacks I have bought from this Starbucks but it is countless and everything was always, and I mean, ALWAYS SPOT-ON! Never had any real complaints except when the lines went out the door a few times during the summer. It is undestandable because summertime calls for good iced drinks and this Starbucks just GIVES it to us! Love that there is a good amount of seating. Love the location even more because it is right nearby to all my weekend shops! This Starbucks is definitely a YAY for me!"

As I wandered the streets I realized that Chez Moi was in the area. I had this place bookmarked for a while so I decided to drop in and see what they had.No oysters but I spied Mussels. It's really hard for me not to order mussels (either as app or entree) when I see them on the menu.So I got a small cocktail and ordered the mussels. I had the sensation of sand on my 2nd one and that pretty much ruined my experience, esp since that gritty first chew was not the last.  I tasted way more grit than I could let fly by. I was kinda annoyed. Chewing with caution is not a good feeling.Am sure other items that doesn't come with sand/grit may have offered a better experience but I was frankly very underwhelmed."

We were basically ignored by our waiter, had to wait a very long time even for water, we asked for bread after seeing many other tables being served bread upon being seated. He wordlessly set down a plate of bread and we then had to ask for butter from another server. Minutes after placing our order, I politely asked if I could also add another appetizer to our order, and the waiter's response was an exasperated/sarcastic ""they're going to kill me now"" (referring to the kitchen?), so I said it was ok and apologized, canceling the order. We ordered one round of drinks and were never asked if we wanted another. Also, I asked for medium rare and received a well-done burger. On the plus side, the beet salad was excellent. But overall, I would never go back because I kind of just felt like the waiter was rude or somehow resented us the whole time, as we were never acknowledged or thanked or checked in on. It was unfortunate for what was a big splurge and was supposed to be a special evening for an anniversary dinner."

The food was good, I had the steak tartare and a side of fries, which were great. We had an outdoor reservation at 8:30, but asked if it'd be possible to sit inside when we arrived as our party was smaller than we thought. They said there would be a 30 minute wait, but we could sit in the speakeasy downstairs, which was totally fine. However, they kept us downstairs for an hour and 20 minutes-- which also would be no problem, I think the restaurant wanted people to fill the space for the 9:30 burlesque show. However, when they finally told us our table was ready and seated us at 9:50, the server was extremely rude and chastising, saying that we had arrived too late and we had to order immediately. None of us had looked at the menu (we didn't have any cell service downstairs) and one person from the group was in the bathroom. I would have understood her frustration if we had shown up and expected to be served at 9:50, but we got there at 8:30.  We were all taken aback by how rude she was, especially after we had been pretty cheerful during the very long wait.It was a birthday dinner, so it would have been nice to be able to order a dessert or drinks at the table, but that wasn't possible as the kitchen was closing and our server didn't return to our table except to bring our food. At the end of the night, we were charged $35 on our bill for a burlesque show that we had no idea was even going to happen (on top of our tip to the performer-- luckily one of us happened to have cash). Overall, we left frustrated and disappointed."

Warm ambiance; the kind of place where you can sit at the bar with a book and good glass of wine or enjoy dining with friends or lovers. The food is delicious with what I consider to be the best eggs benedict and eggs Norwegian in the city. Drinks don't disappoint either-- an excellent espresso martini, melted-to-order chocolate martini, and a beautiful absinthe drip, to name a few. Staff is welcoming and knowledgeable. And the bathroom is tres French with the sexiest wallpaper. Great spot for brunch or dinner, and you can cap the night off by going behind the bookshelf to a Marie Antoinette inspired speakeasy."

3034,HA5H73HvFX74Y-oqJeKrvw,2/16/2020,3 star rating,"I really wanted to like this place and for a while, I did. I've only ever had pizza here. I never felt the pull to try anything else. The first time I came here, I wondered why I didn't come sooner. The pizza was great. After a few trips, I noticed that the consistency of the flavor began to change. It led me to think that maybe that great tasting pizza was a result of me being really hungry, because we all know that food taste a lot different when you're really hungry. All in all it was still good pizza, but I grew tired of it and decided to try their buffalo chicken pizza. Eureka!! It was amazing to say the least. They actually made it with buffalo sauce as opposed to the tomato sauce. I don't know why, but I've hit a few road blocks when it came to looking for some make you wanna dance buffalo pizza. Then something strange happened. On my next visit to get a slice of the amazing buffalo pizza, I saw that they put tomato sauce instead of the buffalo sauce on the pizza and it looked like they just topped it with some buffalo chicken pieces. To say I was disappointed, was an understatement. I asked the guy making the pizza if they didn't have the buffalo pizza with the buffalo sauce. He told me that they didn't use buffalo sauce, but only use tomato sauce to make the pizza. I was highly confused. Maybe I was living inside the twilight zone or something, because I knew what I ate and it was buffalo pizza with some buffalo sauce as the base as opposed to the tomato/marinara sauce. After a moment, I felt like I no longer knew what I was talking about. Maybe I dreamt it up. Anyhow, he proceeded to say that he could add buffalo sauce to the pizza. I really wanted some buffalo pizza, so I said ok. I really should've just counted my loss and walked away though. He took my slice of pizza to the back. It took some time, so I figured they were preparing it the way that I was at least expecting it to look. My expectations were pretty high. It shouldn't have been though. That was my mistake. When my pizza came back, man, I just wanted to walk out. All that time that it spent back there, it came out with buffalo sauce drizzled on top of it. I mean...really?? Then they had the nerve to charge me a little over  $7 for the pizza. Which I didn't realize until after the fact. Not sure if it was meant towards me, but I most certainly took it that way, the lady at the register laughed when she rang me up. I mean...I literally paid the same amount for that little drizzle of sauce that the pizza cost. I just got bamboozled. Not again though. I never went back.The place is ok. It needs some updates and could use a face lift and some cleaning up. The seating area had significant wear and tear and a lot of school children frequent there. It could get a bit nosy at times, but other times, it's pleasantly relaxing. The taste wasn't  consistent, but they had some really good pizza when I did patronize there."

As for the drinks...the Buddha bless was a spot on recommendation from our diligent-without-helicoptering server. It tastes like a smarty. The breakfast of champions was a perfect dessert cocktail and boasted a multitude of flavors. The ambient noise is elevated, but conversation is still quite possible.

Upon walking in, we were greeted by a friendly hostess, whom immediately seated us at a cute table for two (without a reservation at 8pm, no less!). The vibe of the restaurant was energetic and hip and despite being busy, never felt too noisy. I love a place where everyone is having lively conversations and rejoicing over delicious food (without getting overly loud), and this is certainly one of those places!What I really loved about this restaurant, aside from the incredible food, was their service! Each staff member, from the hostess to the waitress to the food/table runner, was polite, efficient, positive and warm! Food highlights:- scallion pancakes (outstanding! Flaky, delicious and comes with a spicy and savory dipping sauce)- Sloppy Bao (two wonderfully stuffed bao buns with minced pork, peanuts, and chili)- Lu Rou Fan (a generous portioned dish of minced pork over a rice, pickled Jie lan and a very tasty soy egg cut in two)- Big Chicken Bun (recommended by our superb waitress, this fried chicken sandwich reminded of a pork chop, and I loved every bite of it.  They weren't lying about it being ""BIG"" either!)"

Overall, my experience was positive. The waitstaff are nice and attentive. The vibes of the restaurant are very different from the exterior -- it's a mixture between homey meets upscale casual. The pros:- Delicious and flavorful. The pork buns were well made and the sauce was amazing. I even poured the sauce onto the Dan Bing because of how much I loved it. - The fried chicken was incredibly tender and didn't feel too greasy. I was very full by the end of the meal, but I didn't feel the ick you usually can experience with greasier foods - Big plates have pretty big portions that can be shared with the table - Easy to do family style here The main con was the price. Prices for this restaurant have doubled and I was pretty shocked when I saw the menu. For the value, it is very much possible to get Taiwanese food at another restaurant that is more affordable. The items at the bakery I felt were reasonably priced and have more breakfast items. So if you have a dilemma about which location to go to, I would do it based on what type of food you want to go for."

Since I was already seated with my friends we decided to just try it out. I'm not sure if this was supposed to be a take on fusion Taiwanese food, because it seemed a lot like the goal was to be authentic - but the taste was not there. The xian dou jiang (soymilk you tiao) was lackluster and tasted like watered down soymilk and needed to be sweeter. Zhajiangmian was interesting with the black sesame sauce which I thought wasn't bad, but very different from what I am used to. Lu rou fan was very wet and soggy, though had a decent taste. My favorite dishes were the Beef roll and oyster omelette. The beef roll had a nice crunch and the oyster omelette had a good portion of oyster and tasted delicious."

This restaurant easily deserves its hype, and has made it's way on my NYC favorite restaurants list! I made a reservation for 6 people, but ended up having to increase it to 7; I called in advance and the host was super accommodating and changed my reservation with no hesitation! We ended up sitting at a round table with a lazy susan, which was perfect for our group. We ordered 9 dishes for a party of 7: pea shoots - 4/5: garlic pea shoots are a staple at Chinese restaurants for a reason, a solid vegetable choice here egg bomb - 3.5/5: beware this is *very* difficult to share. the beef tartare was good! i thought this dish was very unwieldy and hard to eat, which is the main reason for stars off. pan-griddled pork buns - 5/5: delicious, savory, spicy, comforting. clams & basil - 3/5: i thought the combination of sweet potato and clams was slightly off-putting and the scallion pancake was soggy. if clams are your thing though, you'll probably like this! guojie salad - 4/5: (we asked for shrimp on the side) the peanut sauce in this salad is divine, I want to replicate it at home. big chicken bun - 6/5: definitely order this! i love chicken sandwiches, but i especially love this one. we ended up dividing this among the 7 of us, but i could *easily* eat this whole thing on my own. so good! lu rou fan - 5/5: another must order! lu rou fan as a concept will never taste bad, but win son's take on it is full of flavor and texture. sesame noodles - 5/5: if you don't like mushrooms, this is not for you! the mushroom flavor in this dish intertwines beautifully with the sesame sauce. this dish is a true umami explosion zhajiangmian - 4.5/5: this is not a korean jjajjangmyeon-- it's light brown and mostly flavored with fermented bean sauce. the lamb in this dish is delicious! Between the 7 of us, this was just about the perfect amount of food! Overall: Win Son does a really good take on Taiwanese-American food full of comfort and familiar flavors with excellent execution.

Easy peasy Wrong.. we entered and can you say taken aback, you would have thought it was a weekend the bustling activity encountered.Anyhue, our smiling friendly hostess advised 15 min wait we agreed. However the wait gods in our favor and we were seated within 5-6 mins.Our server equally friendly and engaging gave us great recommendations.I ordered the scallion pancakes OMG one of theeeee best I've had and the sauce amazing. I love the fact they were not greasy as others I've had, flaky yet a bit soft, perfection.My other dish was was the Pan Grilled Pork Buns.. people people I highly recommend. The flavors encountered my tongue and roof of my mouth was doing the ultimate happy dance. Speaking of dance their playlist was also a great vibe, various genres played had you swaying, singing in your seats. Not to mention as you're trying to leave its like not yet oooh that's my Jam. We literally closed the place. I'm sure they were like when are they leaving. I did say if you want us to leave  turn off the music.. lol.Win Son was worth hanging past my bedtime.

I hate writing bad reviews but honestly this was such a disappointment coming back and taking my friends here. Before, I used to think this was an authentic delicious taiwanese restaurant but it's become extremely commercialized and Americanized and lacks any quality or flavor. For Asian food in Brooklyn--birds of a feather is THE best and wen wen is so much better for Taiwanese food. My favorite dishes here are the oyster omelette and the fried eggplants. Beef rolls - $31, tiny portions and honestly extremely lacking in flavor and quality. You can literally find better beef rolls at any other Chinese restaurant for less than half the price.Sesame peanut noodles - also super lacking in flavor and anything special, honestly $2 peanut noodles at your local dumpling shop tastes better"

The wait:  we went on a Sunday and I understand that it gets busy, but it took over 1.5 hours to get seated :( 2. Sesame noodles: For almost $30, these noodles were not worth it. It was good, but there weren't a lot of noodles and it was cold. There were also a looooot of peanuts so if you're into that it couldbe nice. Personally I felt like it overpowered the sesame flavor and the roasted peanuts were too hard for my liking. 3. Lu rou fan: I did not like this. There was way too much rice and not enough meat - and this dish was again close to $30. Not worth it in my opinion, and the meat sauce lacked flavor. Wouldn't get again and wouldn't recommend.4. Dan bing: this was basically a really thin scallion pancake fried with a layer of egg. This was delicious, it was soft, spongy and flavourful, but I didn't think it was worth $15. This dish is a really staple food in Taiwan and super easy (and cheap) to make at home, as much as I liked how it tasted, it was definitely overpriced.Overall in this neighborhood there's not much good Asian food so I understand why it gets so busy. Personally I'd rather go to Chinatown or flushing for authentic Taiwanese food that tastes much better and more affordable"

So, when my wife and I made a recent trip to NYC, and we discovered that the NYC branch of Double Zero is right across the street from our daughter's apartment, it was a no brainer: GO.The design and ambiance are very similar to Double Zero in Venice -- same wall of wine, same high-top dining tables, same wood-fired oven clearly visible in the kitchen. Forget that it's vegan (my wife and I mostly are) -- the food stands on its own as really, really good. Ok -- great.We ordered many of our favorites: Basil sunflower pesto pizza, sunflower caesar, baked meatballs, eggplant parmesan, mac e cheese, and cacio e pepe.

Out came a bowl of ice cream soup, my 6yr old niece was not impressed. I asked the waiter (who's English was limited but he understood) if they usually serve melted ice cream and that we didn't want it, he went back in the kitchen, came back and asked if we wanted another scoop of chocolate, not the solution I was hoping for. Instead of bringing back a proper frozen dessert that wasn't sitting out and melting, he charged us and I had to ask him to remove it because we didn't touch or want it. It was a weird end to an otherwise pleasant lunch. 3.5 star and 1.5 star off because the place was empty and couldn't give a kid a proper desert. She was bummed."

For one I do appreciate that they offer gluten free and dairy free options for pizza which is rare to find. But when my friend and I recently visited this spot, we both were pretty underwhelmed by the food. We didn't order the pizzas but instead I got the meatballs and he got a pasta I believe. The serving size was quiet small and the flavors just didn't work. The meatballs were drenched in marinara to the point it was overwhelming. The service was also pretty slow and not the best (we had to wait a long time to place the order, get water, and even get the check). Overall I feel like this place has potential. I might revisit to try the pizza but service definitely needs to be improved"

The hostess was able to seat us inside immediately. The inside was church-like with multiple rows of long high top tables with a narrow alley down the middle. It makes for a congested thoroughfare. The wait staff was attentive, constantly busy, and very friendly. The pizza was okay. We had Gluten Free Squash Blossom Pizza with Blistered Tomatoes and Balsamic Glaze and Gluten Free Arrabbiata with Cauliflower. The crust was thin, slightly undercooked, and didn't hold up to the sauce and toppings. It wasn't bad but glad to find a GF and plant based restaurant."

3061,EF4M55USa1ZNy1rP5Kuk2w,1/28/2022,5 star rating,"Without a doubt one of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan. Pizza is a love language for me. As a vegan it can be difficult to find good pizza that doesn't taste like processed vegan cheese. At Double Zero, you feel like you're eating pizza in Italy. Seriously. It's that good. Their combination of attention to flavor and texture is out of this world. My favorites are the Truffle Cream Pizza, Pepperoni Pizza, and the Margherita Pizza. I also love the Caesar salad, Olives, and the cheesecake. It's also a beautiful space with an elevated ambiance of friendship. Who doesn't love sharing a pizza with people they love? In this case it's a bit more upscale. Im also really grateful that have hired more people of color in the restaurant. Veganism began culturally in communities of color, and it is so sad to see how those cultures are excluded from the vegan scene today."

We arrived first yet we were seated later on in the worst seat with the speakers blaring. Kindly asked to switch seating and was able to get a open kitchen facing seat in the center of the bar. The pour of wine is very stingy. Each plate from start to where we decided to end our meal was beyond salty. So salty my throat and tongue was numb. Now for the worst of it all.... The cooks have stainless steel containers on their counters and they use and reuse the same spoons to stir, taste, plate and serve. All 5-6 cooks just grab the same used spoons to slurp, stir and plate. The wave of nausea came over me when I saw this happening. So if you need to keep your blood pressure at a healthy level and you like to not consume everyone's mouth germs in your food then avoid at all costs and the cost is not cheap."

To see a video experience of the night - youtu.be/pbbh6gETMSAThis was our personal experience, as we know this restaurant has some amazing reviews, and it is a beautiful and fun restaurant.  Unfortunately some of the dishes fell a bit flat and tasted one dimensional and lacked depth and flavour, while other dishes were quite fishy and unpleasant.  We did love the lamb and the dessert, but most of the dishes didn't leave a lasting or positive impression. We don't want to take away from the restaurant experience, as the atmosphere itself was so fun! A beautiful speakeasy behind an art gallery and front row seating to the kitchen is definitely a wow factor."

Chef Franco is a creative and you sense it, taste it, savor it from the first bite to the last. My favorite bites are always the openers, in our two visits I remember standout ingredients from the sea - uni, lobster, kelp, caviar, fluke, foie gras... well foie gras is not from the sea but always deserves a shout out none the less. The presentation of each dish is delivered with delicacy as if each course is an invaluable gift. We are just as enamored with the glassware and the plating as we are with the food. And everyone there is so nice and down to earth. It is an elevated space but there is no air of pretension. It feels like such a warm and comfortable, space. Oh and the wine, we have enjoyed some delightful French wines while visiting and the sommelier is so sensible and knowledgeable- happy to assist in helping you choose a bottle or two for the night. When someone asks what my favorite meal is in NYC, the answer now is always Frevo."

3069,B6yIdUPC2_2hP8SR1oPCxA,10/1/2022,4 star rating,"Frevo is a small restaurant with counter top seating within an art gallery; it is definitely considered fine dining and exudes an intimate ambiance. The best part of this experience is watching the chefs prepare everything from the start to the end. The opening small bites were delicious and my boyfriend also really enjoyed the squash soup. What was also a highlight is the quail dish along with the dessert with a hidden caramel sauce tucked underneath. The overall meal was very good but the remaining dishes I didn't mention felt either unmemorable or one noted. That's not to say it wasn't good, it just means it didn't blow my mind. The round ball looking dessert is also pretty bland with only a slight sweetness from the cake at the bottom. That said, there's definitely a lot of potential for Frevo to become great. I also feel the chefs should try to be more personable and social given the counter top seating with the diners but that's just me."

Every course was delicious. The service, the ambiance, the presentation and all were amazing. One of us did the wine tasting pairing (+$135) and the other did by the glass, I will say by the glass was probably better and also definitely a better value. Everything tasted as good or better than it looked!! If you want a special occasion meal and have the splurge budget this is an amazing restaurant!!"

It's been about a month since I sent it and there's no sign of my fixed bracelet and I can't get a response from anyone in customer service. The only way to contact them is email and the store refuses to help. I'm so fed up with this company.

She was not friendly at all to me right off the bat. I felt as though I had to win her favor and until then, I would have to tolerate feeling not welcomed there. I'm not pulling the race card but then again, it's not a stretch.She had no problem running my tab up to $83.00 and not once was I offered a beer on the house when every other time I've been there, I would be given that courtesy (to include the owner). On top of all that, I was overcharged by her for beers I didn't drink. I guess I wasn't wasted, as she'd hoped I'd be."

Johnny's is the place that rich neighborhoods need where you can still get a $4 rolling rock, cheap shots, sit in the grime. It's tiny but also weirdly cozy and warm and has a good neighborhood vibe.

I got the strong drink but still had to pay the Manhattan price. The bartender was very disengaged and almost came off as he'd rather be somewhere else than serving 30-something professionals. As someone visiting and wanting to learn more about the area, I simply asked him if he was Johnny (just to start conversation) and he replied ""Johnny is dead."" Point blank and serious. I was like ohh ok thanks. Maybe he is tired of people asking him that question?Regardless of the bartender, the atmosphere is gritty, reminding of me what the area must have been like back in the Punk days. Lots of graffiti, bumper stickers and urine/bleach odors. Nowadays it seems to be more popular with the 30 year old professionals living in their million dollar Village lofts looking for a cheap place to drink with friends. Also, they have a jukebox that will play songs for $1. Just became full with what you choose cause this crowd is judging you with their glares."

That's probably the only redeeming factor here.Ordered two burrito's, steak and chicken. Neither had pico de gallo and had way too much cojita and sour cream. Think your least favorite taco truck, as opposed to a great taqueria.The meats were not overdone, but were basically unseasoned. The chicken had some flavor, but the steak just confirmed that the east coast is still learning about carne asada.Not impressed, and with so many mediocre Mexican restaurants in the area, I won't be patronizing this one again."

The service was very nice and relatively quick. I ordered take out and brought it home. When I opened by bag and took out the napkins there was an ant crawling on it, which grossed me out. I ensured that my investigation of the ant was an isolated incident and I proceeded to eat my chorizo quesadilla. It was good. But because of the ant, the unbalanced ratio of cheese to chorizo I have to give this place three stars. I will go back but for now, three stars will have to do."

They had a nice selection for the winter holidays. The plants are definitely pricey, though. They had some gorgeous winter bouquets for $25 a pop. I suppose I'd need an extra special occasion to splurge.There's a rack or two with letterpress cards if you are looking for some, as well.The cafe is definitely cool and more unique than other UWS coffee shops. Most of the seats are not particularly comfortable, so I wouldn't want to stick around too too long. I've never gotten a pastry, but they get them from a few different places (based on the pricing chart that's on the display case). My most previous time, I did splurge on a $6+ coffee drink: mat-chai-latte. I had never seen that combination before, so I had to give it a try. Absolutely delicious. It's the way I'd want always to drink a matcha latte, truthfully. That being said, I'd be broke, so I'll let this drink live on in my memory."

So glad we did.The bagels were perfectly chewy but not too dense like some bagels can be. They also go hammmm with the cream cheese - so delicious. I got the salmon cream cheese and it was amazing. I was so full after eating half though. I saved the other half for after snowboarding and ugh just saved my day. There's always a line on weekends so be prepared or go early when they open! :)

I tried their nova lox and pastrami lox with scallion cream cheese on an everything bagel and loved both, though the pastrami lox is definitely a bit saltier. They are cash only so don't forget to bring cash; if you do, they have an ATM inside. My only regret is that I didn't try more things off the menu before I left town."

The line went by pretty quickly, they have lots of staff helping with orders and putting the food together. There were a few tables inside and I did opt for eating at the shop, although the line was long and there were many people coming and going it was no big deal. Staff were super friendly and each took a turn at greeting us, it was great. The bagel was awesome, I will say that if you don't like an extra toast on your bagel, let them know, otherwise, you're good to."

The sausage was good too but there was barely any cheese Vegan cream cheese bagel: almost couldn't tell the difference between tofu based cream cheese and regular cream cheese. It was great and the everything bagel was flavorfulPastrami sandwich: a bit dry but overall good flavor. A good amount of pastrami given too! Court st. Bagels is a really cute bagel shop with TONS of options to choose from. I commend them for having really delicious vegan cream cheese (it's tofu based) So many different cream cheeses and bagels and sandwich options; you can imagine how hard it is to be indecisive here. The bagels are really fluffy and fresh. You can tell they make them in the shop. The staff are all kind and accommodating as well. I got a bagel with sausage egg and cheese. My dining companions got an everything bagel with vegan cream cheese and a pastrami sandwich.

He was happy to hear how I had been waiting to try a bagel but could never find the time to wait in line.I asked for the bagel to be toasted and sliced and he was happy to accommodate. He asked for me to come back again and I will the next time I'm in the area because it's hard to find a bagel spot these days that have variety but aren't hard/stale.

To be fair, I have not done my due diligence and I do not claim to be a bagel connoisseur, but when we moved to the neighborhood and consistently saw long lines out the door every weekend at Court Street Bagels, we knew we had to give it a go, and man- the line is worth it. In case you don't know (we just learned this, despite loving bagels for many years, if the bagels are fresh fresh, you don't need to toast them, and they are the most beautiful chewy pillows of non-bread you will ever have. I'm a ""scallion cream cheese on plain bagel"" kinda girl wherever I go, though if I'm feeling particularly fancy, I will spring for lox. I've only ever gotten the scallion ream cheese here, and I'm so pleased they've never burnt my bagel (though again, when it's fresh fresh, no need for toasting, remember?).

This one for me is when I have cash and want my favorite bagel, but sometimes you'd don't have your debit card  on you and have to make due with others, which makes you appreciate court st bagels a little bit more.Of note - the service here is soooo friendly, which is not something I expect or hold bagel places to. I will take a great bagel from a mean person, idc. But when it happens to be a great bagel and friendly service I think it's worth highlighting."

They're open during Covid-19 for take out, order in person or by phone. They also have a back patio if you want to risk eating around other people. In pre-covid times, this was always a nice lunch spot, with plenty of indoor seating, a water feature, and a full bar for happy hour hang outs. Good vegetarian selection, just be sure to ask if it can be made without fish sauce, without oyster sauce. The pad si yu is excellent, and the pad Thai isn't too sweet. If you ask for spicy, they make spicy! And medium is medium. Pretty good. The edamame starter portion is generous and the salt is evenly distributed, not like in some places. NB they close during the afternoon for the staff break, which varies but is usually around 3-5pm or so. They don't provide sanitizer, so bring your own."

Not the kind of different that leads to trying something new all together but the type of different that is familiar but when prepared differently makes you feel as if your having an all together new experience. I know that was a lot but I hope you get my point. I found that with Ghang Thai Kitchen.I've enjoyed Thai food may times before but I was most impressed with my meal. The service was prompt and attentive. The honey ginger Martini will make you run in circles it's so smooth. I image most of their drinks are the bomb.Now, as for the food, I had the Brooklyn Basil for my entree and my partner had one of their signature fried rice dishes. Truly, we both barely looked at each other during the meal because the flavor and spice left us speechless!! We also had their Thai dumplings. The food and appetizers we had should receive an A++ . I really believe both our meals were rather exceptional. My partner usually likes spicy and I do not but that night, I decided to go spicy and it made my dining experience phenomenal.

When said order was wrong, replaced it w shrimp w zero apology. Potatoes in curry were almost completely raw. Once telling the waiter, she took it as a joke and chuckled. Green beans were also raw. Shrimps were tiny and maybe 3 pineapple cubes. Pad see u w squid was full of filler iceberg lettuce and 3 small pieces of squid for the entire dish.

The first time I ordered here, I purchased the Pineapple Fried Rice w/ chicken, it was SO delicious and filled with great flavor! The curry powder to the rice is such a great touch and the rice is cooked to perfection. The pineapple brought a nice sweetness to the dish but I wish the chunks were cut up to smaller pieces. The second time I ordered, I got the Thai Fried Rice w/ chicken and it was honestly mind blowing how good it was. The dish came with broccoli, onions, carrots, and some banging sauce on the side they included (it was yellowish). And another thing - the orders typically took half the estimated time which I really love. However, the first and second time I ordered from here, there were NO UTENSILS!

They gave us both the dumplings, which were tasty, but extremely garlicky. I enjoyed them, but wasn't warned. The meals were delicious, the basil fried rice though was very spicy.

There are things that are decent and won't make you feel like you've wasted your money but other Thai places probably do better. My latest order was for lunch. Originally ordered the bbq pork lunch special. They called to tell me the pork was unavailable and recommended the bbq chicken. That's fine, I'm flexible and chicken is healthier than pork! Part of the lunch special is an app AND a soup or salad. Got the two Thai dumplings, totally fine, nothing to write home about. No salad though. The bbq chicken was....not that? It was just slightly larger (very thin) pieces of chicken satay with some wet, old vegetables. Was I supposed to pour that incredibly watery, grimace inducing sauce over it? Alas a sauce on the side does not make it bbq. Super unhappy about it. End on a high note, I also ordered a Thai iced tea which was quite nice and the delivery was very quick."

They also know what's up in terms of fried chicken tenders and fried chicken sandwiches. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. every. single. time. The rippin hot is SUPER hot. So be warned. It's not for the feint of heart. I can eat spicy (love me some serranos and thai chili) but i took one bite of the rippin hot and i needed a full cup of water. I love the original (no sauce) or the sweet & spicy here!Highly rec this place if you're in the area checking out the vessel or the mall.

I'm all for a good spicy chicken sandwich, but both were overwhelmingly spicy and overpowering. I could barely taste the chicken. I later learned that the spicy sauce had habanero peppers infused into it. I liked my jumbo chicken fingers with honey mustard sauce since the sweetness of the honey complements the spiciness of the knockout sauce well. The sauce also went well with their waffle fries. If you're having difficulty finding this place, it is located adjacent to Muji, right up the escalators on the second floor from the 33rd Street and 10th Avenue entrance."

So, the place seems really popular with a line out the door, so that has to count for something, right? While the service was friendly, there was a bit of a wait once you order - perhaps a bit longer than what you might expect for fast food. Maybe they were just slammed? I don't know if it's always like this. It would seem that they are more known for their sandwiches, but I had their chicken fingers. They were disappointing. The chicken fingers were dry, and while on the salty side, there didn't seem to be much else going on in terms of flavor. The crust wasn't notable either. I didn't even finish my food. Maybe I should have gone for the sandwiches. The dipping sauces were pretty good at least, and they give you two of them."

I also ordered the mini sando which is a slider in Hawaiian bread and it is tasty as well. If you can't take the heat, just stick with the original sando and your taste buds will thank you. If you can take the heat, definitely try the spicy one! The waffle fries and the lemonade are really good too. I hope they open in LA soon!"

The loaded fries are probably my favorite over the chicken sandwiches. The chicken sandwich is pretty good and if you are not used to the spice it could have you stomach throwing fits and giving you aches or you sitting on the toilet the rest of the day. The once gripe I have and some of my coworkers had was the chicken occasionally didn't seem fresh.I do wish I had a chance to have tried the Dough x Fuku cross over back in April.Note, also they need to allow for orders on Grubhub slightly later to account for all the orders from corporate cards they will get (as people usually can't order until after 6:30)."

I wanted to try everything but figured I'd go with the Fall themed mini pumpkin bundt. It was SO good! Gluten free baked goods are challenging to create since some blends cause them to come out either dry or super heavy/greasy (coming from a serious amateur baker lol) and they did an amazing job! The mini cake was moist and delicious! Can't wait to come back soon and try more treats. Also the girls working that day were super nice!

My large-ish wedding was transformed into a small, backyard wedding due to Covid. I wasn't planning on a cake, because I didn't think it would be possible to find a tasty gluten-free cake. Enter Helene and By the Way Bakery! *cue a fairy godmother, magical theme song*  Helene swung into action to talk me (and my now husband!) through all the cake options. She answered all of our questions, had a tremendous amount of patience as we went back and forth on details, and was quick to get us all the information we needed.As if a global pandemic wasn't enough to deal with... Enter the big August 2020 storm. Dun, dun, dunnnnn! By the Way Bakery was among the many establishments that lost power and were without for longer than they should have been. Helene called me to explain the situation, apologize for it, and tell me that she was in the process of buying a generator to try to get her locations back on the grid. While we were really looking forward to having a tasty gluten-free cake, it seemed like the cards were not stacked in our favor. But, somehow, HELENE CAME THROUGH! And, let me tell you... it was more amazing than I could have ever expected! I'm still drooling at the thought of the magical slice of heaven that By the Way Bakery created. Lemon poppy cake with raspberry jam and lemon curd filling with a vanilla chiffon frosting. This is was not only the best wedding cake we (and our guests) have ever tasted, but it was also just an ah-mazing cake. Best. Cake. Ever. Hard stop. No caveats. Period.

There were two choices of croissants today! Butter (classic) croissants and almond croissants. I opted for an almond croissant because I needed something sweet in my blood!  I quickly took a bite out of it and thought it wasn't the best. They have better things. But the more the ate, I discovered they had a sweet almond paste in the middle that was absolutely delicious!  it had the right amount of sweetness and nuttiness to it. The pastry part is flakey, but also a tad chewy. It might've tasted better if it was warm. I also left home without anything to drink today, so I needed something. Anything! I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find anything I wanted there (besides their coffee selection, juices, and sparkling water), but to my surprise, they also have lattes and tea! Between the chai latte and matcha latte, I ordered the matcha latte, and it was a great option. It is on the sweeter side, but I'm not complaining! I don't normally have sweets, so this was my treat to myself. It's sweet and had a good amount of matcha to it: not too overwhelming and not too subtle. I'll have to check out their savory options the next time I visit!"

There are so many to choose from, and they are all $2 each so picking a dessert to go with your coffee is a serious exercise in restraint. (Sorry Padoca but your snacks are too $$$) The staff are pretty friendly and although this place doesn't really have seating, it's perfect if you want a midday break to pick up a coffee and dessert. YUM."

And for its location, right next to an enormous  hospital, for them to be selling everything for two dollars is madness.My favorite things are:The almondy: hazelnut spread on top of a very moist cake with a crunchy substance sprinkled on top. Can get messy eating it, bewareAlmond croissant: incredibly soft on the inside, doesn't even have the flakiness of a croissant on the inside. I can't describe it perfectly but it's somewhat cakey inside and I love it! The sugar and almonds on the outside are so sweet. Whole thing is delish. The only thing I didn't like was their beverage selection. Really healthy, note many sweet options like juice lol"

I also got their cheese bureka which was pretty good. It has a consistency of a croissant with cheese in the middle.

I saw this cafe earlier in the week in Yelp and was definitely drawn to it from their ""Everything is $2"" slogan. In half disbelief and half curiosity I decided to give it a try and I'm actually glad I did!As advertised everything is actually $2! (Tax not included) When you walk in it almost give off bodega-esq feels, small and really no seating, but attentive counter staff ready to take your order.After walking in you also discover the wide array sweets they have displayed for your choosing. They also have a selection of juices, fruit, and cakes in their fridge container at the end of the store.I ended up going with a standard large coffee and coffee cake ($2 each, respectively). After my friend ordered we walked to the nearby park and enjoyed our food and drinks. For the price, quality, and quantity this place is definitely worth it. I'm happy I discovered it and it'll definitely become a go-to spot whenever I'm on the UES in the future. Definitely make it a go-to in your list as well!"

So dry that you could bread a chicken with it.  Im not sure if it was edible at all!!! Called to complaint and they said that they dont know what happened and they will call me back wich never did. After more calls on Thursday they told me that humans make mistakes and they will give m a 20 % off in future orders and that would make m happy. I said why should I ordered again and he said that they DESERVE a second oportunity.

We came on a Friday night for dinner and the place was completely filled up with fellow diners in no time. You should DEFINITELY order the Arancini (it's divine), the rigatoni and then olive oil cake. Those were my three favorite dishes. My friend loved the orecchiette (I fear I was too full to snag a bite) and we also got the mushroom wholewheat pasta (good, but nowhere as good as the rigatoni, IMO). This is a well-loved neighborhood spot, and a great post-Brooklyn Museum dinner option if you're ever in the area."

Only saw their small outside seat, so when we finally arrived (indoors), was charmed by its modern, charming indoor space.Service was on point. We made reservations (via RESY) and got seated right away in their indoor space. We were a tiny bit concerned because of COVID but appreciated that they were checking vaccine cards.The menu was simple and easy to understand. We ordered a drink, gem salad, orecchiette over braised pork and kale, and fish w side sprout salad. The food came out in a timely manner and was well presented and very delicious.We were overly impressed with how the server was always in our area and poured us water before our water cup went to half. We checked in a few times. Other servers came to take away dishes we were finished with. Service was impeccable. Maybe too impeccable. The only thing was that the space was tight maybe just in our area so it did make us a bit nervous about COVID. Overall excellent experience. Definitely going back! Great for a nice occasion."

They have a 90 minute seating policy and we did arrive a little bit late so I know they weren't happy about that. That being said I still think the host and server were quite pleasant and informative when telling us information about the menu. Every dish we had was very clearly thought out with a lot of interesting notes. Even the gem salad, which is usually something pretty basic was so fresh and lightly dressed that we ate every last bit. The beet salad was lovely with the beets perfectly cooked. The broccoli rabe served charred was also definitely a highlight!We tried two different pastas and I was really impressed at how much meat was in the Orechiette dish. It was very bold and flavorful -bordered on a little too salty. The Gemelli however was light and refreshing and very interesting with the alfalfa sprouts in there-perfect spring dish!I also highly recommend the Pana cotta. It was perfectly sweet and creamy.I loved the interesting decor and they had tables very well spaced out. I absolutely plan to come back!"

In any event, maybe we are complete weirdos, but we like our pork chops with ""no pink"" - its just a thing, dont judge too hard as we like sushi, sashimi and some steak medium rare.So the server says firstly, no we can't that.  so im thinking to my myself is that because they cook em all in advance or are they just too stupid to know how to do it that way.  we followed up nicely, and the wait staff said ""she would look into it"", lol.  so she scurries off on her little mission.so, while she ""investigates"" as to whether this could be achieved somehow, a squabble at our table enused.  1/2 the table thought if the chop could somehow, through some cooking miracle, be cooked with no pink, that the chop should be ordered.  the other half argued that either there would be somesort of retribution (use your imagination) or that the shittiest chop would be used so that :we showed them"" sorta of thing.turns out miracles do exist, but the chop was never ordered."

My husband and I finally satisfied our curiosity and tried their almond croissant, pear danish, and a miche bread. All three items were extraordinary. The twice-baked almond croissant was our favorite. Rich yet not too sweet, flaky, and generously apportioned with almond paste (or was it frangipane?), it was a thing of beauty in appearance and taste. Bien Cuit's almond croissant is more expensive than others in the area, but you certainly get what you pay for. The pear danish, also twice-baked, was similarly buttery and delightful. Although pricy at $16, the miche bread is hefty and gloriously textured and fermented. It easily upgrades our meals to restaurant quality."

The croissant was a bit stale and probably not very good when fresh either. The baguette was utterly tasteless. We threw it out after 3-4 bites.  Service was ok for the super quick transaction but prices are exorbitant. High prices are acceptable for exceptional quality, which Bien Cuit did not deliver."

The bartender (can't remember his name, but he's Australian) was very kind and funny. Once my buddy came to the bar, who I didn't know was a regular, dapped up the bartender and the friendliness cranked up. He's in my top 5 bartenders in NYC. I can't tell you the other 4, you'll have to read my reviews. Any who, as I was waiting for my buddy and it 'twas happy hour and they had my FAVORITE sour beer on tap! Anderson Valley Gose is so tough to find and I was very happy to be graced with its presence. Also, $5 for a beer in Harlem, sold! I also ordered from the HH menu:-Beef Sliders with a chipotle mayo and cherry compote (HIGHLY recommend)-Garlic fries w/ lemon-mayo dipping sauce Food was out of bounds good.

I can't rate this place on food only the drinks and service. (Except the truffle fries, they are very good!). My friend and I came here one evening around 9:00 on a Saturday and there was only one other table with a couple finishing up their drinks. The waitress served us our drinks and fries and never came back to fill our water, give us napkins, or see if we needed another round of drinks. She was just fixated on her phone. Then there was another time I had a male server on the younger side that was standing at our table constantly trying to flirt and pick me up. And when I ordered a martini with a splash of ginger ale he laughed and said I should order something else. I was uncomfortable ordering a drink from a young waiter trying to pick me up. Though the other times I have been here earlier in the day there is a nice bartender with an accent, he seems to be a solid server and makes a good drink. But overall, for the price of the drinks I would suggest spending too much time here. It's unfortunate but I'm going to take a break from this spot for a while."

One protein plus 4 toppings (any toppings including avocado, egg whites, etc) for one price. There was also ample dressing choices... The options are limitless. I found the salad very fresh and the ingredients very flavorful. I also enjoyed the communal long wooden tables that overlooked Lexington Avenue, perfect for people watching. Obviously you would never go here on a date, or for a big night out. It's perfect for what it is, a quick lunch and a break from the office with healthy options The Damage: after my company discounts my salad came to ~$6.50. So much more reasonable than other options in the area."

After getting a salad there (yum) I looked up Cafe Olympia on Yelp and was shocked by the low rating. This place is great! They have so many options for whatever you may be in the mood for, from salad and sandwiches, to a hot bar, Japanese and Korean food and much much more.The place itself is pretty standard, really big open space with lots of kiosks with the different types of food. There are tables to sit down at, as well as free wifi (which is sometimes wonky at first but it will work). I personally usually get the salad (I got there at least twice a week now) and if you don't get a meat then you're actually allowed 6 options to have with the salad instead of 4! I also just had the veggie ramen today which was pretty good as well, they make it fresh right in front of you.Yes the cashiers are pretty short with you, but such is the standard for a busy lunch spot in Manhattan. If they were going slowly and taking their time to talk to you I'm sure dozens of people would be pretty upset.  There is a $7 card minimum, but most of the lunch dishes cost just around that after tax anyway so hasn't been an issue for me. This place is so much more affordable than many of the other lunch spots around, and I go here often and haven't been given a reason not to come back!

We arrive right as they opened and there was a long line of suits. But right as you walk in it is a really nice space. They also have cute areas for outdoor seating. We didn't have a reservation (i would highly recommend at lunch hour) but they sat us at the bar. We really enjoyed their cocktails and wine! The food was just as good. We even got a complimentary plate of prawns from the kitchen. We are not in midtown much but would definitely go back. Loved the ambiance, food and drinks."

One of limitation of our group this time was one of my friend is vegetarain  so restaurant we go has to have vegetarian option and Nerai has it. I have tried all food, vegie and regular and they were great! quality and service was professional and wonderful. We had salad, drinks, pasta, duck, coffee and dessert. There were a construction and smell near by so they moved us to sit in different table to avoid the unpresented smell. The vibe is good. I have a mix feeling between tourist spot and local spot because this place is in a tourist area but for me as a resident I still go because I was shopping in the area and just want to find some nice place to eat."

On the side was creamy rice with spinach and tomato.All were excellent. Especially great was the braised short ribs paccheri. The braised short ribs were so tender and flavorful. Paccheri was cooked just right. This could have been the best meat dish I've ever had in my life.Waiting staff were all friendly.It was Thursday night and place was completely packed. All seats at the bar were taken and there were people still waiting at the entrance.Don't forget to make a reservation.
3210,_G6lH3rUyhyIxXHyQWFlag,9/21/2022,4 star rating,"I won't lie, the food here is very good--I enjoyed everything we ate. Having gone to to Greece for two weeks in July, I was looking for something to remind me of the amazing food I had there, and the food hit the spot.The prices, however, did not. Now I came in kinda knowing that, but that didn't take any sting out of the final bill.A Greek dinner wouldn't be complete without a nice glass (or bottle) of crisp Greek white wine, and this dinner was no different. Our bottle clocked in at $80, more than I had been hoping (again, compared to my time there where a bottle could be as little as €15) but it was still very good. There were far more non-Greek options on the menu than I would have anticipated, but I suppose that's to cater to folks that just don't know how good Greek wine is. The somm (yes, they had one) did provide this great recommendation, but only after trying to upsell us (as expected) to something in the triple digits. For starters, we got the zucchini chips with tzatziki, the three spreads, and the greek salad. Zucchini chips were on point, and the tzatziki was pretty good. A little cucumber heavy, but the yogurt was done well. The salad was very good, nice and vinegar forward like I like, but the three spreads...unfortunately, I was hoping for more based on the amount of pita they gave us. Tasty yes, but I literally wanted more. What a weirdly small portion size. Generous pita, though. For dinner I totally zoned in to the whole fish, and I thought it was extremely tasty. It came pretty much deboned, and the lemon-based sauce was excellent. I won't harp too much on it, but we did have to embark on several scavenger hunts to find our waitstaff and once or twice almost got up to pour our own wine (which was chilling just out of reach). Meh. It's easy to rack up a bill here, and given the location on 54th street, I am not surprised. Clearly there are pros and cons, but if you want to go ham on some upscale Greek food, come on in."
3211,_G6lH3rUyhyIxXHyQWFlag,4/17/2022,5 star rating,A great dinner spot for seafood/greek inspo! I seriously enjoyed my meal so much and want to come back especially for the lobster pasta.I started with the salmon crudo which was so refreshing and zesty! The quality of seafood is especially good here!!! The star of the show is truly the lobster pasta. This dish is something I can't stop thinking about it. It was so filling so the price is very justified. The lobster was so buttery and juicy and the pasta melted in my mouth. Probably the best squid ink lobster ive ever had. overall i had a great experience with the food and service as i was served quick. i will recommend this to everyone i know and definitely be returning

Firstly , the vibe is cool with a nice bar area yet we dined upstairs which was a bit more intimate ( the lighting is quite subtle and sheik with great decor). Service was phenomenal sets the benchmark for NY dining  in my mind. We order a lot of food : tuna tare tare, spinach turnovers for reference and a Caesar . As far as mains , it was basically all fish with Salmon and Halibut . All were exceptional with everyone very happy and impressed . A top notch venue and lives up to the ratings!!"

Indoor and outdoor (seating area) decor transforms you out of the city from the moment you walk in.Service was very on point. Our server was very attentive, gave good recommendations and checked on us every time with a smile. We felt welcomed and not rushed.We got the grilled octopus (tender and flavorful), zucchini chips (delicious and table fave!), fried cheese, Brussel sprouts (this was recommended by our server, this was one of the best Brussel sprouts I've had - next time i come back I'm getting 2), aged steak and lamb were both cooked well and not overcooked. Must leave room for dessert. The yogurt sundae (recommended by server) was our fave. There were a lot of flavors that blended very well together in one bite. The yogurt trio each had a unique taste that was very easy to distinguish."

3216,_G6lH3rUyhyIxXHyQWFlag,7/26/2022,3 star rating,"We had quite a large party and for appetizers, we started with the Pikilia, Saganaki, Spanakopita and Tuna Tartare as well as a round of drinks. My personal favorite was the Whipped Feta dip, but we ran out of pitas for the different dips and though we requested more, they didn't show up until we finished our entrees (which is a little silly to me). After appetizers were cleared and before entrees arrived, our waiter asked if we wanted to order a second round of drinks which we put in for, but like the pitas, the drinks didn't show up until after entrees were cleared. At that point, we didn't even want them. For my entree, I ordered the Lemon Gnocchi specifically to try the Avgotaraho add-on which I was most excited for. The Avgotaraho was fine, but the quality/cook of the gnocchi was abysmal and unpalatable. Like eating playdoh if I am to be quite honest. I tried a few bites of a friend's Squid Ink Linguine and that was much better, as was the Grilled Lamb Rack, which left me even more disappointed.Our waiter was pretty MIA most of the evening, perhaps they were short staffed or we caught them on a bad night, but some hits and some misses. As for our experience, I'm a little torn on my review. On food quality alone, Nerai is amazing, but pricing and service-wise, I do think it's quite expensive for what you're getting and for that, I don't think I'll be back."
3217,LNVu-bQA_ASIcWJlClgz-Q,9/30/2021,1 star rating,They advertised an unlimited monthly coffee program and when I went in they said that it didn't start for another week. When I came back they were closed indefinitely. After spending a month here in NYC I notice that most of these stores are closed temporarily or have strange hours. Yesterday I received an email regarding their unlimited program and the price is twice as much as they had originally advertised. Their website is also under construction. Either incompetent management or this place is struggling financially. I wouldn't trust them at this point to buy anything long term.

I showed them my vaccination card but didn't have my ID on me and he yelled at me multiple times, that's not how you talk to customers.

Every place should do that IMO.  This particular Pret is quick in and out for me, I guess I come in just before the big rush usually around 11-1130 range. I have had a few of the sandwiches and they have all been fine. Not totally outstanding but a decent quick,fresh sandwich. A thai wrap I had was way oversauced and was leaking in the bag one time but thats about the only issue. The egg salad is very good and the baguettes in the sandwiches are always crispy.    The staff here are all very friendly as well. Never had a counter person not greet me with a smile and a friendly word."

Fresh cold sandwiches and salads with juices or organic coffee. They also have a small hot food section with soups and sandwiches and wraps. Items are typically in the $5 to $9 range. I am putting this review more as a critique of this location. This one is located next door to the Jack's 99 Cents near Penn Station. There is a moderate amount of seating and it is very clean. However, it can get very crowded at lunchtime because of it's location."

Need I say more?The vibe of Claw Daddy reminds me of The Boil. Their menu is very similar, featuring seafood dishes, sandwiches, fritters, and customizable boils. They also have an extensive drink menu with a ton of soju cocktails and mojitos. My friend and I walked in on a Monday night for happy hour and got a table easily. Service was so friendly and attentive. I ordered a Pineapple and Coconut Mojito pouch, a set of 6 grilled oysters (minimum of 6 per order) and the Crab Cake fritters. My drink was very fruity and sweet, although strong. They definitely don't skimp on the rum here. The grilled oysters were so juicy and fresh, seasoned with a garlic, parmesan rub/sauce. I would have ordered more but I needed something heavier. The Crab Cake were condensed mini crab cakes. They were fun, bite-sized snacks but I did find myself missing the feeling of biting into a larger crab cake and tasting chunks of crab meat. This is a great spot for seafood lovers. I would love to come back for more happy hour deals and to try their po-boys!"

We kicked off with some drinks, all pretty tasty, and in those adult Caprisun like pouches! We then ordered crawfish poppers, some Brussel sprouts, grilled oysters, and fresh oysters. The oysters tasted fresh, and the grilled oysters were delicious! They don't compare to if you were to get them in New Orleans, but I still recommend them as they're so different from fresh ones, especially if you're not a big fan of the texture of fresh oysters. We continued with crab legs, shrimp, and mussels with the claw daddy's sauce in mild and medium. We added some andouille sausage as well, but I'd say for the 7 of us, it was pretty filling! In terms of sauce, I feel I've definitely had some tastier ones, but I'd still come back to Claw Daddy's for sure!"

I thought it was alright, but ultimately not amazing. The crawfish didn't quite taste fresh, something was off. My guess is that they freeze them but can't say for certain.The waitstaff was REALLY friendly and helpful so that's a plus. The cocktails in the caprisun shaped pouches were fun and quite tasty. All the apps we had were very solid including Mac and cheese and boudin balls. There is outdoor seating but it's pretty meh, basically just a few picnic tables on a crowded street without much separation."
3230,qS7XkSNgG_XXtWp5YeKIOg,3/11/2023,4 star rating,Get ready for lots of salt and lots of sugar if you're coming here! They don't have a full bar so your only options very strong very sugary (hangover pending) drinks. They were still delicious! But something to keep in mind. I went with some girlfriends and we all got the claw boil with the mild (definitely still has a kick) garlic butter sauce. Its a lot of food so come hungry and its all verrrry salty. Exactly what i would expect from this kind of style seafood. It has a more datey romantic vibe than most crab houses I've been to. It doesn't feel like a tacky seafood place but instead like a more upscale restaurant.

I texted my sister in law to see if I was maybe going crazy but then she told me that she couldn't find her half of the charge in her bank statement, which was really weird considering we both got receipts to sign. That prompted me to check my bank statement and that's when I saw two separate charges from them even though I only signed ONE receipt. Everything we ordered was during happy hour and somehow our bill came out to over $200. I've tried calling them, left voicemails, dmd them on Instagram and I'm literally being ignored. I requested for an itemized receipt to be emailed to me. No one has contacted me. We had 3 rounds of drinks: $993 rounds of grilled oysters: $542 rounds of wings: $24Plus two free sides that we got using the Yelp check in. Add that up and the total doesn't even come out to $200. My brother in law gave Felipe $100 in CASH and was supposed to split the rest between two cards. My card was charged twice for $80. He literally jipped us thinking we wouldn't notice and now the restaurant is dodging calls. Extremely disappointed. You can't trust anyone these days."

I love eating at places with lots of people so we can try a bit of everything. I think we ordered most of the menu. LOVED the mac and cheese. Crawfish queso dip was pretty good. The gator bites were good - nothing special as far as taste. Deviled eggs were good. I did like their caesar salad as a caeser salad fanatic. Lobster bisque was OK - it was the non-red looking one, is it supposed to be red? the SHRIMP was amazing! I got the head-on SHRIMP 1lb with the Claw Daddy's special sauce, mild, which was drool-worthy, add corn and sausage (kinda spicy for me). I had leftovers for 2 days and savored each bite. I loved how they served the boils in an actual metal pot instead of just a ghetto plastic bag. They provided bibs, gloves and napkins.Their drink specialty is an adult capri-suns which adds to the fun vibe.Overall, it was a great experience and the food was top quality."

I personally enjoyed the raw oysters more. I haven't been here since before covid so the menu definitely changed. I prefer their old menu where you were able to choose what seafood options you wanted as a combo. I settled for the combo they had which was ok. The sweet potato fries were crispy and big. My friend got the pastalaya and it looked heavy. The workers were attentive and friendly. Our server was patient. I would only come back for happy hour and the Wednesday special. I would probably just get the shrimp bag since shrimp contains the most amount of meat.

I think this place is good if you would like to get a drink or two after meal. They have tacos and other things, but I find them as more of chasers than meals. The place is conveniently located by the DUMBO so if you are thinking about visiting the area and want some drink after, check this place out:)"
3242,E9NMNWvV70HV5gB369N0EA,6/26/2021,3 star rating,"This is a cool little spot tucked away in the foreground of Brooklyn's famous DUMBO. We stopped by this place during a Brooklyn food tour-we had heard a lot about their tacos and outdoor garden. Upon entering, we were kindly greeted by the staff and led on out to the back for seating in the garden. If making a reservation here, I'd strongly recommend opting for outdoor seating. The garden is beautiful and all tables are surrounded by cool plants and greenery. We opted for the Chips and Salsa (as a starter), Verduras Tacos, and Tinga de Pollo Tacos.Chips and Salsa - At $7, this was honestly pretty expensive for some chips and salsa. Unfortunately, the chips were super greasy and oil was visibly smeared on the surfaces of the chips. They tasted fine, and were a great carrier of the wonderful salsa. The salsa tasted fresh and definitely had a kick to it. I just wish that the chips were done better.Verduras Tacos - These were really good! The veggies were fresh and crisp and the tortillas held together well. I was super confused by the carrots on the side, however. They were nearly raw and were not seasoned at all, so they went completely against the flow of the rest of the dish. Other than that, the tacos were satisfying and the portion size was decent.Tinga de Pollo Tacos - Great flavor on these...the cotija cheese on top complemented the tinga and the tacos worked well overall. However, mid-bite into my second taco, I chomped down hard on a chicken bone. This was a big no-no for me; there was definitely not supposed to be bones in this dish, and it could have been a safety hazard had I swallowed it. Luckily, I caught it and was able to complete the rest of the dish without much more complaints.I feel like this is a really solid place that still needs to work out some kinks. The food tastes decent overall, but nothing extraordinary or unique. I'd recommend stopping by for a light lunch if in the DUMBO area."

I ordered this dish ahead of time and had to wait for about 34-40 min for it to be done. I wasn't to mad since that let me know that they make it fresh for you.

I've tried both the chocolate chunk, and the classic with m&m cookies, and thought both were delicious. THAT is what 4 stars are for. The downfall of this location (and several others throughout the city), is the staff; they earn 0 stars. The staff ""wears"" a mask; unfortunately it's around their chin (not covering their mouth or nose). Truly the last thing you want to see during a pandemic, when the staff are handling your food; and quite frustrating when they're QUICK to correct you on your own. The staff also always has a rude attitude, whether it's because you asked for 30 seconds to decide what you want, or if it's because you're ordering ""too slow"" for them (one told me I took too long, she had already entered my order (had not paid yet), and if I wanted milk it would be to be a separate transaction). I've been to this location several times and I can't be clear enough how off-putting the staff is; they all really need an attitude adjustment."

I got  an Aphrodite cocktail which was a strong and tasty gin-based drink, but still pretty pricey for $20. After 1 drink though, the bf and I decided it was time to make moves to a different spot.

3301,ex1WChkTutAweSI0Bfhxkg,6/22/2012,5 star rating,"Well, say you are on the way to the airport.  Preferably JFK terminals.  This is a great lunch spot or brunch if you wake early to head to.  It's right near the A train stop and they have great prices.  I had the Chicken Roti which is $6, but it might be more to have it boneless...not sure perhaps a dollar more?  I got two other sodas and my total came out $9 and change. The roti itself is served separately, so that way your chicken  meat and juices do not sog up the bread.  The roti is light and crisp with crushed yellow lentils inside the bread.  The chicken roti comes in a curry sauce which is flavorful.   I do know they have variety for the interior of your roti: conch, duck, beef, oxtail, shrimp, goat and of course chicken.  They also have doubles for $1.25 and $2 if you want chicken with your doubles or is it inside the doubles?  Not sure.  I have only been here twice, but if only it were closer, I would visit it every week. When inquiring for the doubles, they will ask you what sauces you want.  Tamarind, spicy, and something else which I forgot.  My apologies. Did I mention that they have pumpkin?  currant cake?  aloo?  and other yummies for your tummies?   With about 8 tables and plenty of seating, I find that I never had to fight anyone for a seat or hunt and peck for one.  I sure like this place.  =)  And best of all, they do have a sink located on the same floor (sinks come in handy since people usually eat roti with their hands) and I should mention that there is a bathroom located downstairs.  There is a sign that mentions not to run down these flight of stairs."

I couldn't believe that her response sought to refute me. I told her that, ""foil is aluminum, which is a metal."" She apologized but her disregard for food safety and customer service has turned me off from this place. I'll take my business elsewhere and I suggest that you do too."

3306,ex1WChkTutAweSI0Bfhxkg,11/11/2010,3 star rating,"I came here a few times on route to the City from JFK (the Q10 stops off right by the entrance to the A-line), so I figured to explore the area.  I was looking through the shop windows in this area of Richmond Hill, and noticed that  Sonny's Roti Shop had quite a number of people in there.  I saw people ordering ""doubles"" (I didn't know what they were until recently) so I decided to follow suit.  They were pretty tasty with all their chutneys and sauces that come along with this Indian-Trinidadian infused concept--the double.  The first time I got it, it was pretty good since it had all the sauces to go with the channa (chickpeas), and the bara ('bread') was not too soggy.  But the second time I came here, the bara was a bit cold and soggy for my taste, and the channa didn't have enough seasoning.  The guy that did my order failed to put in any of the chutneys after I had asked to make sure that there was enough sauce in it.  From what I understood, doubles should be piping hot, but in both experiences they weren't piping hot.  Perhaps I came during an off-time, but hey, it was only $1 for each double, so I can't really complain.  They definitely are a quick bite to stave any bouts of hunger."

They ALWAYS get your order wrong. Bacon comes raw, missing key components, or just not good. I can't tell you how many times I've ordered egg w cheese and not receive cheese yet get charged for it. Or make specifications to an order and it goes out the window, like asking for bacon well done or hash well done and both come raw.  Who eats it like that??? On all the cooking shows they go on and on about how bacon should be served and this place would fail over and over. It's sad. Especially how sick someone can get from uncooked pork. So. Today was the last straw. Ordered bacon egg and cheese and potatoes and eggs with onions and peppers, which I have to ask for or I'll literally just get potatoes and eggs on a roll. I also asked for butter on my roll. The owners dad, I'm guessing since he's been there as of lately, informs me they always put butter when I asked the order be repeated back to me and made no mention of the butter in my order. I said okay, just wanted to make sure there's butter on my roll. Btw he also made it more than clear it was an inconvenience that I ask for the order to be repeated back to me. Upon delivery. I get a bacon egg and cheese with what must be one egg bc it was barely visible. Usually its a huge sandwich with 2-3 eggs. He must be making decisions on how many eggs he feels a sandwich needs. But of course! My potatoes and eggs had no butter and barely any eggs. Why should I have to go in my fridge to put butter on the sandwich I've ordered. Really.Of course it was a problem that I let it be known and quite frankly idgaf bc you're running a business I'm your customer placed an order the customer is always right and if not you lose business and gain nothing but negative word of mouth. Let's just say papa bear wasn't too happy with what I had to say and told me not to order from them anymore lololololololololol Guarantee this place will be gone within a few short years. Can't imagine it thriving between lack of customer service and horrible food. There isn't anything I'd recommend to anyone bc nothing is good. Mediocre, at best."

Then waited for 45 mins for two baked ziti and have four hungry kids waiting also. Sizes change tremendously if i knew it changed i would've got three plates. Its not my first time here so i know if theres a change and they denied it. The russian waitress was super disrespectful and said they are making out of scratch at in a rude way.

Remember, it's a diner so I would not order certain items off of the menu, i.e.: baked ziti (I read the ""1"" Star review); however for typical diner items (basic breakfast, grilled cheese sandwich) the place suffices."

It's nice that they deliver and you can order directly from their Yelp page. There are several other sushi restaurants in Greenpoint  and a handful are really good. But I choose to order from Sakura for their consistency and their staff are so nice to me. I usually get their spicy crunchy tuna, spicy crunchy salmon and eel avocado with a side of spicy Mayo. I've gotten their shrimp tempura in the past too and it's yummy as well. If you're looking for a no frills, legit sushi spot? I  recommend this spot. They have both indoor and outdoor dining options too."
3318,oAFaJmLbqnpgIqHP2YAywg,11/7/2020,5 star rating,Outdoor seating was perfect for weekend sushi! Staff is super sweet and they do offer both indoor and outdoor. We got a boat and was extremely impressed with the quality and size. Will definitely be coming back

That's why #I came here.I ordered the #Sashimi Regular with Miso Soup. And after I was taking photos, I noticed there was rice. This isn't Sashimi! I asked the waitress if she brought me the wrong order. She said she thought I ordered the #Sushi Regular. In my mind, I flipped out and pretty much wanted to kill myself. I realized I already put my filthy baby on the food, so I ate it. And I demanded another #free carafe of sake, even though I wasn't finished with my current one.In the end, it wasn't the #end of the world like I thought. But it was weird that I did want to kill myself in that quick sudden moment. I'm assuming it's like a conflict of #self-identity or just not getting what you want when you think it should be easy ...therefore, the mental conflict. An interesting experience and lesson. #Five stars for not killing myself."

I've been here several times before for lunch but this will be my first time reviewing it.So here goes...do they have the friendliest waitstaff EVER??? OMG THEY ARE BETTER CHEERLEADERS THAN THE DALLAS COWBOYS GIRLS!!!!Today I ordered sushi a la carte Ebi, Unagi and Lobster Tail Tempura with Sake ""Hana- Awaka *Sparkling Flower"" and an appetizer of Kani Salad. The salad was okay and honestly I've had better but it was good enough. But let me tell you about that sweet sparkling Sake that almost had me on the floor...because I was leaning after having only half the bottle (maybe 6 small shot glasses of it)...it was DELIGHTFULLY AMAZING!!! I will be ordering that Sake again anywhere I go that serves Japanese Sake! It's now written in my personal law and constitution foodie book.Okay onto the sushi...can you say massive?! Yeah I know what I ordered may have seemed pretty basic and may even have looked basic but it was all about portion and flavor!! There was love put into my sushi honey no doubt about it!! I thought I could eat it all but The a la carte was so gigantic (to me) that I could barely finish it all I had to have the rest wrapped up to-go.Yep, I'm going back whenever I'm in Green Point Brooklyn again."

I must say today was a reminder of how great this place is, and how crappy our best sushi joint in CT really is.I ordered sushi deluxe with dragon roll and explosion roll, my hubby ordered sashimi deluxe and 2 spicy tuna rolls. Waitress politely smiled and asked if we were sure it's not too much, we smiled back and said no.The fish was fresh, and pieces of fish were generous, we enjoyed everything and I also ordered to go for my daughter, it will make her day enjoying it while she does homework. We told each other that we will only eat sushi here from now on. Worth the trip, great service."

It was a Yelp Elite perk where we were able to go and get a free item on the menu so I decided to go. The staff was super nice and gave me the rundown of their menu. I was mistaking their menu with Sweetgreen and kept saying things that were Sweetgreen related. The person helping me was so nice and just played along with it (I am so sorry...). I got the Japanese Supergreen with marinated chicken thighs instead of the chicken breasts because no one really likes the breasts... They let me choose as many dressings my heart desired on the side. The guy that was helping me suggested the miso dressing and wow did it take me back to 2010 when Just Salad was a treat to have for lunch because my $5/ meal budget couldn't afford it on a regular basis. There are many Just Salads in NYC. This one is no different, BUT! It just opened and the people are super nice! If you work, are around, or live around the area, it is a solid place to grab a healthy and filling meal. It is not like your ordinary salad where you need to eat something else afterwards.

Based on other Yelpers' reviews, I also got the Crispy Chicken Poblano Salad, which consists of lettuce, chicken, cheese, avocado, corn, red onions, and tortilla chips. I've had many salads from elsewhere, but honestly speaking, this was the best salad I've had in NYC. The freshness of the ingredients, delicious dressings, generous portions, and quick and friendly service made me love this place! Whenever I order a salad, I will always order from Just Salad."

Also located close to Bryant park so you can take you entree to go and sit and eat there! I ordered the poblano salad which was recommended by the employee there, who was also really nice and even recommended adding a touch of the spicy avocado dressing. It was delicious and filling. I want to go back abs try the beyond meatball Tex mix salad next! Overall great quick lunch and dinner spot."

They normally close at 8:00 but when I got there they still had everything in stock, and they were really welcoming. I'm at the manager, Felipe, and he was very nice in helping me order. He recommended the crispy chicken poblano as one of the most popular options. The salad comes with dressing either on the side or on the salad, and a piece of bread. I appreciate that both the bowl and the salad dressing are both in compostable/recycled material, not wasted plastic.The salad was really filling and high quality, and I will definitely be returning for a quick lunch spot."

I could tell as the place still had that new car smell,  LOL, or I should say a new salad smell. Super nice and helpful staff. Made my salad to order. Ingredients are so fresh here and the choice of salad dressings are delicious. You can put together a make your own salad as I did, or choose one of their signature salads.As with anything on the healthy side in this city be prepared to pay a bit extra. This chain is worth it."

No.  It's already cooked.  I guess they want to cook it twice.Located next door to my office?!  YES!  Which is how A LOT of lunch places survive in this city.  Only during work will I eat something called a ""Texas Wrap"".  Well, at least I get to Yelp about it."

The deli in fact is pretty tight, and a lot of people seemed to be popping in during the time we arrived to pick up a wrap.FOOD:My boyfriend and I split a turkey club wrap. It was warm and pretty tasty once we got it and went on our way. The bacon in the wrap is what really stood out for me. Was crunchy and crisp and I think made the wrap. The food is a little overpriced, but what do you expect? You gotta pay for convenience!WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT:I wouldn't choose to come here regularly if I actually lived in the city, but it was on the way to our destination and we were looking for a quick bite on the go."

The ice coffee, frightening. Ech. xcThe heroes are good, the chicken parm is great. I go here often because I work close by.

I just bought an egg & cheese this morning (6/11/14) and got charged $4.07. One egg and one slice of cheese; no coffee or juice. Apparently they raised their prices 2 months ago; like they weren't expensive enough already! Neve will I be back there. 1 block away at the pizzeria you can get an egg & cheese for $2.75...tax free. Good luck One Way! You get two stars because I get it, you have to do what you have to do to get your business running but your prices are ridiculous! Your eggs aren't even organic! Pfft!"

It also so happens to be that they messed up the most simplest order, a bacon egg and cheese. I tried to catch the delivery guy before he left with no success, so I called and told them my order was incorrect. I was then told that I would have to wait an additional 20 minutes for the sandwich and that they wanted the incorrect order back (which btw is a health violation). I had to go in between seeing patients to get the correct order (which was already made). So I would have been waiting 20 minutes to receive a cold sandwich that was ALREADY COLD when given to me. This is the second time this place gets my order wrong and does this. You're better off physically going and actually watching them make your order instead of ordering for it to be delivered."

I've had the caesar salad and mexican wrap. very good and full of flavor.  Also, they're pretty big considering the price so I usually have half for lunch and save the rest for later.Only con is that they don't take debit/credit.

It's also laptop friendly, making it a nice work space. They have interesting old-school, vintage toys and a little library with random books.

If you don't mind waiting 30 minutes for your order or be served by someone who clearly doesn't want to be there, you've found your go-to place.

Today, a very pleasant gentleman named Matt took the time to contact me personally and apologize for the situation that I was in. He also, personally delivered the correct original order to me free of charge. Bottom line, the food here is absolutely amazing they don't disappoint with the quality and presentation. Also, the service and communication was and is extraordinary. I'm very happy with how everything worked out and how they handled my complaint and made it better for me as a customer.I will continue to order from Pier 69 and stay a fan of their great food!"

I told him what I wanted and he went behind the counter and immediately started making it without washing his hands or putting on gloves. I was appalled and told him he just took the trash out and needs to wash his hands. He rolled his eyes. Turned on the sink, got them wet and turned the sink off. He never used soap. I was horrified an employee was so cavalier about handling trash and then serving a customer food. He needs to be fired and all employees need to be reminded the importance and THE LAW to wash hands."

Great prices and amazing jute box. Although this bar is filled with sketchy mentality ill port authority people, this has been a safe haven for me and many in midtown. I have been a valued customer for 5 years and become friends with the owners and staff. Tonight the new bartender not only refused to play the songs I paid to hear on said jukebox , she gave me a ton of nasty comments, verbally accosted me and preceded to try to physically attack me. I left assaulted and paying for not only my tab but the jute box which I fed money for 20 songs and heard 3 because she decided to not allow the jute box to play. I made it a purpose to come here and after dealing with this bartender I and all my friends will no longer come back.

Whoever it is that runs this place, clearly gives zero shits about a few things:*Cleanliness - Its a dive, get over it*Music made this century - be ready for older tunes, but to be fair, modern music mostly sucks.*The economy - how is the beer so cheap, not that I'm complaining, but hot damn. *Modesty - the ""wallpaper"" in the men's room is old playboy mags; again, not complaining*If any of this bothers you - if they gave a shit they would change. This is the epitome of a dive, and if you're into that sort of thing, you'll probably like it here (I know I do)"

I was deeply satisfied with my drinks and I want to say Leigh Ann was working the bar that night and she was wonderful.Really the only thing I don't like about this bar is how incredibly loud it is. I can barely hear the person next to me and I don't like screaming at a bar. The music was fine, it just really needs to be turned down a bit. Also the crowd can be a little sketch, so I suggest going with a friend. I'll be back for those cheap PBR's though, but maybe with ear plugs next time.4/5"

If you live in the area, love heavy metal and want a friendly refuge, Blue is your place.  Otherwise, for NYC visitors, go somewhere touristy and check that bucket list box."

Why is it that after five months of doing this, at least three times a week, my drink is either not made when I get there or it is and none of  five people working, are announcing the drinks for pick up, so I I have to wait. Honestly, I wouldn't care about waiting if I want trying to catch the 82 bus. So recommendations, order 20 minutes in advance. Your drink might be cold and made incorrectly but it will be done and allow another 5-7 minutes for them to announce your name. ‍"

I'll definitely stop in for my caramel macchiato fix when I'm in the neighborhood."
3424,OEq7bxXewS6l3gBGU5KAuw,12/21/2020,2 star rating,"Been there 3 times. 2/3 of the times my order was somehow messed up. The first time I went there, I asked for a GRANDE hot chocolate with no whip and almond milk (I have a severe dairy allergy). I was waiting for a while and asked the barista that took my order if they remembered my order. I got a ""mh"" every time until i asked another barista. I ended up waiting 15+ minutes to get a TALL hot choc with 2% milk and whip cream. I had an allergic reaction right there, in the Starbucks. I got back on line and (politely) told them how they messed my order up. I ended up getting my normal order. I spent a good 30 minutes there. The second time I went there, I ordered the same thing and ended up getting a plain almond milk (I'm being dead serious). It took 5 min, pretty good timing. I didn't have enough Time to re order so I left with a plain almond milk ( it was $5 for a 16 oz cup of almond milk). The third time I went I waited 10+ min for the same order and got it lukewarm. Not that bad for this location. Which is a bit sad. Almost every time I go to Starbucks the baristas there are really compassionate and welcoming. At this location, they acted they didn't want anything to do with me and just want to get out of there ASAP. I would recommend going tho the one In the target a block away except their hours aren't so good. I was really disappointed because I have only had positive experience with Starbucks except for these."

I do love that this location has a lot of seats and tables so studying or working here is perfect. But service really needs to change for the better. The employees are always so slow, whether it's taking the order at the register or making the drinks. There's always a wait. Yesterday morning, I walked in at 6am. The store is entirely empty and I was the only one ordering. I still waited a good 10 minutes for my order to be done. It wasn't a difficult order. 2 Iced Coffees, 1 chocolate croissant and 1 plain bagel. Oh well, I guess there's a reason this location always has a line."
3427,i0pTGtQYAPseFcAryoWj4A,4/19/2018,4 star rating,This is our families go to place for Chinese food in the entire  Bensonhurst and Bay Ridge area for take out or delivery (not dine-in). Steven and his family who own and operate this business started out about 10 to 15 years ago and have consistent quality affordable common Brooklyn Chinese food with an extra star for quality and consistency. (also they have amazing tacos) .I consider myself a part-time food expert on the local scene and beyond but please try to understand when it comes to Chinese food in a predominantly crowded congested Chinese area the food quality differs and can even suffer with some of the neighborhood places not getting a proper or good rating from the Department of Health. Dragon Garden has consistently had an A rating throughout there history and I have become personal friends with the owner. Call once and they'll remember your phone number and address if you call consistently from the same phone number. Some of our favorites are the sesame chicken dinner special which always comes on a bed of rice but you have to ask for pork fried rice and they charge a little extra. My personal favorite dish having lived in Chinatown for short period of my life is Young Chow fried rice which is more or less a Cantonese dish and Dragon Garden can match the exact flavors and variety of vegetables and meats that you would find in Chinatown New York City. As of 2018 I feel the quality of food got even better and I just tried some of the Boneless roast pork tips and they were point on and as they say in Brooklyn banging.

Their Shrimp tacos are awesome. I'm a big fan of guacamole but I wouldn't order it from here because it's watery and lack of flavor to it.As for their chinese food, I personally enjoy it very much. I usually order their french fries with cheese - they use two types of cheese on top of it which makes it yummy. Another favorite of mine is their garlic sauce. Anything I order..is with garlic sauce. They also have awesome chicken wings there! I usually order the chicken wings with cheese fries combo. Food is cheap and satisfying! Definitely should try out this place if you haven't already."

Also your getting 4 not more then that like others suggest. They have a TeX-Mex menu which was OK. But seriously nothing to brag about. The inside of the store was rather clean so I did like this very much.

Curly fries - who can go wrong with those!Garlic parm fries - The homemade chipotle mayo needs it's own shout out. Honestly I could drink the stuff, I put it on all the fries, and the chicken sandwich. I honestly took a cap for my leftover to bring home it was so good!

It's nice to have good halal eateries in Manhattan (not just chicken over rice!)Food: I tried the doubles and go burger and the tall grass cheeseburger and customized it to my liking by adding onion rings. One thing I really like about this place is there is no fuss about customization you can easily customize any burger or order in general. The doubles in your burger was phenomenal and as was the beef burger but my God was I shocked about the size. For the price you're paying you get a very generous portion! And the taste is great too. I also tried the wings and fries which I thought were really good too. I definitely need to try their salads and mac & cheese next time.Service: The service here is so great and the lady at the cashier was super helpful with helping me decide what to get so props to her for the great recommendations. Ambiance: they have both indoor and outdoor dining that follow all social distancing protocols which is great.

When we walked in, we were pleased rly greeted by the employee behind the counter and asked to wait just a moment to be served. We were given menus and all took a look.Once we all decided what each of us wanted, we individually went up to the counter to place our orders and pay. I had ordered the Fire Rock Burger, a soda, and a side of Seasoned Curly Fries. My total was around 17 dollars for all three, which is a little overpriced, but not too bad for NY. Within about 10-12 minutes, my order was ready. The food was presented in a pretty appetizing manner. My burger container BBQ sauce, potato chips, jalapeños, and turkey bacon. In terms of flavor, I was pretty underwhelmed. The party itself wasn't that thick, and the flavor of the meat itself didn't even taste salted. The Seasoned Curly Fries were decent, but nothing special.Overall, I think this place gets a lot more hype than deserved. They do have decent service, but the burgers are mediocre. I did enjoy the Garlic Fries that a friend of mine had ordered. Out of all the places NY has to eat though, I don't think I would pay this one a visit again."

They have a small and cute outdoor seating area. The server, who seemed to play every role that night, was great! He always sanitized the table as soon as someone left. We were seated first and told to come in to order when we were ready. He brought out all our food too. We paid upfront but he uses the receipt to give our order to the chef so we weren't asked for a tip. I was surprised because he wasn't expecting one at all and unfortunately I don't carry cash on me to leave one for his hard work!As for the food, I got the tallgrass burger. It was around $10 which is a pretty decent price. I wasn't a big fan of the actual patty. It was a little crumbly and not seasoned enough for me. My bf got the Fire Rock burger but he made it a half pounder for a dollar or so more. They put the potato chips and jalapeños on the side for you to assemble yourself which was great. He also wasn't a big fan of the patty because he likes his medium rare but the restaurant only does medium well. His burger was also smothered in the bbq sauce which ruined the flavors for him. We also got an order of the hot buffalo wings. They were a bit soggy from the condensation. There was also a lot of skin left on the wings and it wasn't crispy to make it appetizing. The hot sauce was pretty standard.I got a side of their onion rings and curly fries which were delicious! You get such a huge portion for just a $5 combo. Also they have a great sauce of sauces you can get inside. They have this chipotle mayo that I dunked practically everything in!Speaking of inside, it's a very small shop.

But the sauce/dish itself was ... something was missing. Can't pinpoint it though. Artichoke pizza was too oily and salty.Be aware of the aji -- so spicy. But their aji de rocoto (the creamier one) hits the spot. The flavor is similar to that of the one I enjoyed in Peru so much. That was the best part of the meal tbh :)"

We sat outside, within the outdoor dining shelter. Drinks were a tad expensive but very tasty. Would recommend the passionfruit martini! Our food was incredibly tasty, though the portions were on the smaller side of average (perhaps the American average, that is). The salmon was very flavorful, as were the shrimp risotto and Amazon fried rice. Everyone loved the food! The staff was friendly attentive. In the heart of the West Village, the crowd is young and stylish, but the venue is versatile enough to cover a range of occasions. Would recommend for a date, or a larger gathering of close friends."

Amazing vibes all around, the day I went they were having Brazilian Night so there was live music the whole night as well as dancers floating around tables which was super fun. Service was fast and staff were welcoming and friendly! Reviewing on food itself - I've definitely had better/more authentic Peruvian food and I do think this place is overpriced. But again, great atmosphere so I would recommend visiting if you're thinking about going! Just not sure I would NEED to go again."

3517,KxFUde0zYhZXBeJKnwPzMg,8/9/2022,4 star rating,The iced coffee was just okay and chai was a bit sweet. Overall the biggest draw of this place is the really large seating area. There's a lot of places to sit and you have access to outlets and wifi if you want it.

All have been great. Staff is all really nice too. Mona lisa, dirty chai, americano, bean oat smoothie all really good. Hot drinks always a good temperature too"
3519,KxFUde0zYhZXBeJKnwPzMg,5/10/2022,3 star rating,"Stepped in here to kill some time the other day. I think I've been here once or twice years ago. It is a cool spot to hang out and people watch. Relaxing atmosphere. They seem to have a lot of healthy snack options, smoothies, acai & pitaya bowls, sandwiches, pastries, etc. I can't speak for the food but holy hell the drinks are expensive and really tiny. I spent $5 on a small chai iced latte and the boy got a peppermint tea for about $3.50. I don't normally go for chai but wanted something less caffeinated than straight up coffee or a latte. Which most of the drinks were around $4-6 anyway. The small is the size of a dixie cup on a heap of ice. Used half my ice to cool down his hot tea. I feel so ripped off. Even worse than Starbucks levels of ripped off because at least the drinks are twice the size and you accumulate loyalty points. The chai tasted fine but was probably pre-made with a powder or mixture of sorts. It just tasted like cinammony milk and sugar over ice. Cute but not cute. Would go out of my way to go to a different coffee shop to kill time."

The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the carrot zucchini loaf was actually very good (albeit cold and a bit dry). The staff was also rude."
3521,KxFUde0zYhZXBeJKnwPzMg,8/26/2022,2 star rating,"I have been going here regularly for many months. I return because it is one of the only spots with tables (when you can get one) but there is plenty that puts me off.Overpriced. I always order a large iced latte (small is tiny and no medium size), and it ends up being at least $8 because I have to pay extra for the right milk and an extra shot so it actually takes like coffee. The coffee they use in iced lattes isn't even fresh espresso - they bulk make a tub of espresso and store it for the day. The workers rarely measure the espresso, and just put however much they feel like so it is either a cup of milk or an iced coffee. I have to ask for my sugars each time because they won't put them where customers can get them, which just adds more work for the employees. For water, they will only give you a miniature cup of tap water without ice, which makes you want to buy their bottles which are super overpriced and come in two bad sizes: too small and huge (they use their own brand of water).Most of the sweet food I've tried has been bad except for the espresso brownie. Often extremely stale but still selling at full price. Bagels are good.Employees are mostly very unfriendly but I don't blame them. They clearly don't like working there. Manager/owner? is often there during the day, sitting at a table. Not friendly.More seating than most places but the chairs can be very rickety because they are so old. Most of the tables are unusable at a certain time of day when the sun hits and bakes them, but they won't put blinds in. The high tables are uncomfortable and most people don't like them but they have quite a few taking up space.System for wifi is ridiculous. You have to have a receipt with a special code to log in (but many employees don't tell you you will need the receipt as you pay) but you can only use this code within exactly 15 minutes of your purchase or it times out and you have to buy something else.They also blast music so loud that it feels deliberate. People won't be able to hear you if you answer the phone inside.I overall get the vibe that they don't want anyone to really sit down; they want to get as much money out of you as possible and then kick you out.They close at 9pm, but I have heard that they used to stay open later. I think it would be worth doing that again because there are always people who want to stay longer when they are closing.The bean at Astor Place has a lot of the same problems but I have found that they have more consistent coffee, somewhat friendlier staff and more tables. The other bean is nice but always makes the coffee super strong.This place and the space has such potential but the attitude is off-putting, to say the least."

I can't put my finger on it.  There's MUCH better coffee within walking distance. Why the stars off were bc of my recent experiences with their service. One counter person was really cool , once. Then the next 2x I've been there the girls I've dealt with were aloof and seemed confused.  I would never knock anyone who is new to what they're doing but these girls just seemed to not care to smile.  Also , their "" rainbow layer brownie "" is terrible. And what pissed me off is it that they call a uncut rainbow cookie that.   What ? We're not in NYC? The land of rainbow cookies ? Get real. It's not a brownie. And whatever you call it, it was dry, had hardly any almond taste, and the chocolate had that cheap mouthfeel. Like it's saturated in palm oil or maybe too much cocoa butter that it coats you mouth with that oil stuff.  For the first time , I threw out a ""rainbow cookie ""."

I rarely complain about customer service, but I've been to multiple bean locations around the city and I have NEVER had my order forgotten about MULTIPLE times, this location being the exception. 5 people were working. One training a new employee, someone at the register, and 2 other baristas. A couple people got their orders before me, but after that I was waiting for 10-15 minutes until I noticed no one was even working on my order. It wasn't under the cashier said ""You have gotten your order yet?"" until I had to wait another 10 minutes. By the time I got my order my lunch break was over and the barista could've cared less if I had to wait an extra 30.

I found out that their chickens are trapped in battery cages, confined without light and natural walking space. These chickens are then fed growth hormones in order to grow at a very fast rate, enlarging their breasts. This enlargement causes them to be unable to walk, move, and relieve themselves. These are living beings. Stop supporting McDonald's cruel company who profits off of animal suffering. For more information: imnotlovinit.com"

Since my review, I've been here probably about 6-8 more times, and I still stand by the fact that their glazed donut is the best glazed donut I've ever had....but only when it's done right. Unfortunately, there's a bit of a consistency issue, and it's not necessarily linked to time of day. Sometimes the donut is fat, fluffy, and perfectly fried, and other times, it's greasy, a little heavy, and the bottom of the donut is a bit damp with oil. I haven't figured out a pattern, but I truly don't think it's a timing issue where I bought an older donut that was sitting in the display for a while, because there are times I've taken a perfect glazed donut home, eaten it hours later, and it was still perfection. I dunno. Again, when it's good, it's SO good. I just wish it was like that all the time."

The egg is scrambled, omelette style, they put a good amount of ham and the right amount of cheese.The bagel with cream cheese is also better than any place in the area. They put on a lot more cream cheese than other places which is what really wins me over. My partner is a huge fan of the donuts, particularly the glaze.

As I waited I realized they were super low on donuts. On display there were only 3 donuts. When I received my donut I overheard he was also out of chips that went with their sandwiches. When I asked if it was a busy day he said some days it is quiet and that day it was just hectic. I liked his customer service. The donut was HUGE which I appreciated since it was almost $5.

My personal favorite was the Red Eye with a oat milk (they also have almond milk available too).They also have a selection of breakfast and lunch options too from paninis, omelets, to delicious crepes! My dad's favorite was the Salmon Panini! They definitely don't skimp out on the quality and quantity when it comes to the paninis. The crepes are to DARN TOO GOOD. Each of the crepes we orders left a satisfied smile on our faces.Even if there was a mistake with the order, they were more than happy to fix it for us. They were considerate and quick.

They make eggs in advance so that when someone orders it they just throw it on a roll or bagel. I like my food cooked to order not something that's been sitting there. I know they do it to save time but if it's not busy they should cook to order. Also they are very sloppy when wrapping up the sandwich. Most of the time my eggs are falling off the roll. The only good thing is lady at the counter is very friendly and understanding whenever I have a complaint.

For about $8.60 you can chose your lettuce, one protein, one cheese and UNLIMITED veggies for no extra cost..... even.... wait for it.... AVOCADO!!  Do you know how rare it is to find a place that offers a delicacy like avocado for no extra charge?!  They will probably hate me now that I'm sharing this juicy piece of info.  Anyways, to sum it all up- the salads are always bomb.  The guy who makes them is so quick and can really handle the sometimes long line.  The cashier is always really friendly and gives you a free roll or sometimes lemonade with the salad.  I recommend going before 12 or after 1 to avoid the long lines.  Also, their bagels are pretty good too.   They do offer some seating in the back and you can only pay with a card if it's over $5.The only reason why I didn't give them 5 stars is because I feel like they could work on their organization.  Sometimes it feels like there are random lines + people going to different cashiers...

One warning, as I said food is decent but DO NOT buy a burger, the meat they use looks and tastes like grade F meat. I work in the area and have eaten here about 6 - 8 times. I would have given this place 3 stars but when I get a chicken cutlet sandwich I expect it to be a hot sandwich. As i said inconsistent. I would not recommend this place if you have a better alternative however if you are not to picky and don't want to spend a lot for lunch or maybe you're in a hurry, then give it a try."

All of them. I checked out the pepperoni knots and they had black specks on the side of them which I am hoping was pepper. After looking more closely, I realized that City Cafe had given me garlic knots with - not even cooked - cut up pepperoni sitting on top. I lifted one and the pepperoni fell off!

Ordering thru Yelp/Grubhub was easy and fast, my food was ready in 15 min when I placed my order around 12:45pm. When picking up my food, since the space is long and narrow, glad to see they are enforcing social distancing with a designated ordering line and separate pick up line, with stickers on the ground indicating where waiting customers can stand 6 feet apart. They have plates, bowls and salad options and I opted for a bowl. Similar to other fast/casual places you choose a base and add a protein, 2-3 sides and a sauce. I went with grilled organic chicken, roasted zucchini, snow peas and green beans, and fried sweet plantains over coconut rice. Some reviews mentioned their chimichurri sauce, so I thought why not give it a shot? Yummmm. So glad I did! So tasty and went great with the chicken. Every item in the bowl was fresh and delicious. Coconut rice was short grain rice with a savory and slightly sweet coconut flavor. Grilled chicken had flavor but not too salty or overly dry. The veg items were both good and the plantains were perfect. Definitely will be returning to try other items."

I was looking for decent pizza around midtown west... already had a bad experience so I was cautious.  Then a coworker recommended this spot so I took a stroll to Radio City Pizza. (Sounds touristy but nothing like it...) First impression: ""omg I don't belong here""...  small space, nothing fancy, 2nd level for seating, 2 man operation, patrons are mostly Construction guys on the job, and a few messenger types, and a few suits... then there's me, Bright Pink Coat... well, I have to eat too! The guys are nice, they let me pick my pizzas first, I got the Margherita and Sicilian... (tell them if you want it really hot so the cheese is bubbling!) my mistake - my darn eyes were bigger than my stomach! Doh! The Margherita was so good! Fresh chopped tomatoes and basil and crushed garlic... mmm... still salivating... I could eat like 4 of these!! #nojudgementplease The Sicilian... was like a mini personal pie! It was too much cheese... I ended up tearing it apart and just munched on the crust! A good crust is the true foundation for good pizza!  $8.41 total - midtown prices.. I look forward to hanging with the boys! Pizza Pizza Pizza!"

They didn't have chicken parm made which was a bummer but I went with pepperoni and Parmesan which was great! Each slice is 4.50 but if you get 2 slices you get a free can of pop or water bottle! They have a small eating area upstairs which overlooks the main ordering area down below. They also have a bathroom for customers. Service was pretty friendly, about what you'd expect with a streetside pizza place. Glad I stumbled upon this place as I was exploring the city!"

The restaurant is a very small store front - with a few outdoor tables spread out. The outdoor dining area was slightly unkempt though - so keep that in mind if you decide to eat out there. Both times we've been they haven't had any of the fish tacos available which is disappointing, especially because it takes up a good chunk of the menu. Really would like to be able to try their fish taco! Additionally, each time we've gone we have ordered the nachos. The amount of food you get for the 15 dollars is impressive. (It's a massive take out tin that feeds my friend and me for two meals). The actual toppings of the nachos though were a bit hit or miss. I appreciate how they give you such generous spoonfuls of guacamole. The flavor of the meats are very fragrant; however, there's not much toppings available apart from those and some cheese, sour cream and hot sauce. Would love if there were some other textures thrown in the mix. Additionally, the most recent time we got the nachos the chips were broiled for too long so a lot of the top chips were very burnt. My friend got a carne asada taco during our most recent trip there and it was a good size taco heaped up with meat. Flavor was good as well albeit the meat were just a touch too dry. Finally, our recent trip allowed us to try the pollo plate which was disappointing. You get a small half sized take out container with just the chicken, rice and beans. The rice and chicken possessed good flavor but the beans were way undercooked to the point where some were still hard. I also would have wished that at the price you pay you could have gotten a couple of tortillas on the side or some different toppings mixed in. All in all, a nice small restaurant that has a few hiccups but can still provide an adequate takeout meal."

This place has a target audience and let's make that clear: NYU students, specifically after a drink or two or three. I'm simply not or have ever been that type :')I can only speak for the Al Pastor tacos: succulent pork grilled to perfection, cilantro, lime, even pineapple! Presentation was even impressive. So, there is actual culinary art going into this taco joint.But, it simply isn't a ""cheap eat"" in my book. Portions to overall price doesn't add up to 1 $ sign, that's all-- and that's *not* their fault.And, the most important question: would I eat there again? Most Probably."

I was looking for San Locos and was disappointed to find that it's no longer there and saw Taqueria Diana which was across the street so I figured I'd try their food. I ordered a chicken bowl.

Plus, I didn't like the fact that I left a tip and the guy couldn't even put my soda in the bag. Not coming here again."

Service was good as they were very attentive to me and my wife (we were the only people in at the time) but still, they were super friendly and helpful. Now the food. Although the prices were higher than we expected, the food and portions were massive. I ordered chicken nachos and received a whole tray which I couldn't finish. My wife ordered a chicken quesadilla and I'm sure they shoved a whole bird into it. Now being a Mexican restaurant, I'd expect it to have a bit more flavor and seasoning, but being in hipster east village, I imagine they try to tone it back to please the locals. 7.5/10"

I was skeptical because I was already living in Kew Gardens and to me the best pizza in Queens is from Dani's (don't fight me). The first time I went I tried the plain because I think that's the best way to test out a pizza place, by the plain. If that's not good then you can just forget about anything else. When I got my slice I noticed there were sesame seeds on the crust. I was intrigued and delighted after that first bite. I don't know why but I would have never thought of adding sesame seeds to pizza dough. My life was honestly changed after that because I'll go through periods of craving ""that-pizza-with-the sesame-seeds"". The other day we were running errands and passed Joey's and we had to turn the car around and get a few slices from here. If you are in Queens be sure to try the pizza here, it's honestly worth it. Currently, because of COVID seating is limited to like 2-3 guests but they definitely deliver and pick up is available."

Food prices were reasonable.Drinks 4/5 - Don't remember the exact names of the drinks. Pictured pink one was something about a tornado and was very good, tastes like a frosé. Espresso martini was average. Another not pictured drink was called something Steve and looks clear like water but tastes pretty good, sweet. The drinks are pretty pricey but that's Manhattan prices! They're strong though if that's what you're looking for. Happy hour runs from 5-7pm with a limited menu.Atmosphere 4/5 - The space inside isn't very big but the seats are plush and look so comfy.

Perfectly fine, able to people watch, and then moved once bar stools opened up. Chatted with Jack, and will definitely be back to try more creations. Had the watermelon cocktail, and asked for extra spicy, was well made and well balanced with a decent amount of heat to it. Can't remember the drink after, and then moved onto a few bartenders choices. Had the truffle fries as a snack as well, and their dipping sauce was stellar. I love having really great cocktail bars make drinks not on menu, because they're always on point. Atmosphere was lively and a mixed bunch, and was definitely worth visiting. Will be back for sure!"

At $15-16 per cocktail it's pricy but not unlike anywhere else in Manhattan and the drinks were better then mostly anywhere I've had so far. I can't even remember what I tried but my favorite was the Dara's Mom which was sweet, sour, tangy, etc. All of their drinks were boozy too which I appreciated. Nothing drives me crazier than when I pay for a $16 cocktail that's mostly juice.The place itself is cool and the service was fast for the most part except for, ironically, the end of the night at which point the check took awhile to come. With that said, they were able to split easily as it was all electronic so it was a fast system.All in all, would absolutely come back. Great cocktails at a great price.

Kamikaze was super tasty and presentation was good too. Its a must have. We loved it. Curry puff, Drunken Noodle, Monster roll and Thai Iced tea was good too.The Reasons for me to give Spicy Shallot 2 stars:1. The blue couch was dirty. It had hairs and food from pervious customers. They did not clean it before so I had to ask for a napkin to clean it myself.2. The server was not friendly and showed us a little attitude which made us uncomfortable so we couldn't even tell her that we are here to celebrate my friends birthday and ask her some questions about the menu.3. They did not give us any dessert or drink menu.4. Short ribs were not flavorful and it was hard to chew.5. They ran out of the noodle I wanted so I ordered Pad Thai but there was a smell in beef of Pad Thai Noodle so couldn't even try more than 2 spoon.

This restaurant is very aesthetically pleasing and inviting. I always would opt to sit indoors vs the outdoor seating if possible. There are about 10-12 tables inside so it's a cozy spot mid side. For appetizers we got the crab rangoons and they are great! Super crispy on the outside and the filling is warm and smooth. The sweet chili sauce pairs well. For drinks there are these beer pitcher servings of Thai iced tea so for $8 it's not bad portion wise! For entrees I order the drunken noodles and volcano chicken. Both which are staples and delicious for the table. Overall I enjoyed my meal and would come back again especially for the crab Rangoon.

This time I came with my kids for a quick lunch before going to the office nearby! We ordered the lunch menu, appetizers and drinks. 1. Basil fried rice - great, appetizing, a bit too spicy for me2. Koi Soi - this seemed like a spicy version of masamman but it was good. Will definitely have it again. 3. Duck dish - absolutely lovely 4. Pad Kee Mao - my kids devoured this in minutes Their food for the most part is all good and consistent. It's your general Thai restaurant flavors. I appreciate that they're consistently good quality and good service."

Haven't been back since they renovated so it was great to see the changes. Very sleek and modern with comfy chairs and benches. Shared the giant Thai iced tea with my husband but would be a generous amount for 2-3. Ordered the curry puffs, duck curry and the salmon clay pot. The curry puff were huge and very stuffed with flavorful curry chicken and different spices, it paired really well with the vinegar sauce on the side. The duck curry came with a side of rice and the presentation was nice with generous portions. We asked for medium spice levels but it was VERYY spicy. The salmon clay pot was just okay. The salmon portion was big, the rice had a very sweet sauce mixed in already but they put more eel sauce over the whole dish which made the entree too sweet.  We ate around the parts that had too much eel sauce. They had a nice area for outdoor seating and we saw it was also air conditioned outdoors so that is something nice to consider for next time."

What I love about Spicy Shallot is that their food is always consistent. Every time I've been there, it's equally as yummy as the last time. Worth the wait on weekends."

I got drunken noodles and thai ice coffee, in addition to the mango sticky rice which was made fresh.All of the food was great. The drunken noodles portions were good and the flavors were addicting, although a tad spicy for me despite it being mild (boo to poor spice tolerance). The Thai ice coffee was refreshing, a tad sweeter for my usually taste since I generally like low sweetness for my drinks but would still recommend-the sugar isnt adjustable unfortunately! The mango sticky rice was the highlight and definitely satisfied my cravings.I had gotten takeout and the food took around 20min as I wandered around. I didn't realize this place was right under my nose and just a 5 minute walk away, I'll know better next time!"
3633,7rc7e_mw5DefMCSBsuZYhg,7/1/2022,2 star rating,"Came here with my husband and grandma around 4pm on a Friday and I think we caught them at an odd hour when it wasn't busy for their main chef to be working because we were very surprised the Pad Thai for a Thai restaurant came out pretty bad.We ordered the jumbo thai tea, grilled squid, chicken satay, pork lettuce wrap, som tum pu, mango red snapper and pad thai. Jumbo Thai Tea - could be shared amongst two people. It's huge! probably a pint size.Grilled Squid was my favorite appetizer as it has the perfect texture and sauce but the lettuce wrap lacked a lot of flavour. I think they might have forgotten to add the fish sauce or something but my husband requested it on the side we added it in ourselves and it instantly tasted much better.Chicken satay we felt could be a little more charred? It wasn't undercooked or anything but was a bit bland by itself.Som Tum Pu - always been a lover of papaya salad but with the added raw soft shell crab? Yum!! Even though we asked for Thai Spicy, it came out mild so I was a little disappointed there.Mango Red Snapper - my favorite!! You have to take each bite with the mango or else the fish is a bit dry by itself but man, the fish was cooked to perfect with the crispiness you get with each bite and the fat abundance of meat. Definitely a must try if you love fish.Pad Thai - most disappointing dish for a Thai restaurant. It was way too soggy and did not look appetizing at all. Compared to other pad thai's we've had in the area. we were surprised it came out the way it did and kind of expected the noodles to be a bit bouncier.Overall, really good service and ambiance. There's a full bar and instagram friendly backgrounds if you're into that sorta stuff. Food wise I would skip a couple of their items but otherwise it's a great date spot and place for catch ups.Total came out to be $150 with tip and tax~"

Today I've gotten the Unagi Don bowl ($18), salmon roll ($6) and Lychee refresher ($7). My lady friend got the Pad Kee Mao Udon, spicy ($16) and the Mango refresher ($7). Mao Udon dish: flavorful, regular spicy which was just enough spicy to feel the heat and also enjoy the foodUnagi Don: eel was cooked to perfection topped with sesame seeds, avocado and rice to fill my stomachSalmon roll: loved it, definitely fresh & not fishy Drinks are so refreshing, sweet and was the perfect combination for our meals!

We ordered the sashimi and sushi combo and also the sushi combo with two yellowtail hand rolls. Note: only bottled beer served here , no draft beers. We got two rounds of sake and beer totaling the bill to around $175 after tax and tip. I loved the sushi, the vibe, but the attentiveness of the servers weren't quite 100%. I just assume everyone was very busy which is more than alright in these times. There was an extra beer charged to the bill, which they fixed quickly so make sure to look at your bill when it comes. I saw some dishes on other peoples tables which looked amazing and would love to try them next time.The quality was great for the price, granted inflation is rough right now! But i will come back."

3638,YNJlbYYUiK8_OIhaTwckXA,6/28/2021,4 star rating,"My friends and I were craving sushi one night when one of them recommended Ki. We called at around 5 pm on a Friday and were able to get a reservation for four people at 8:15 pm.I believe it's indoor dining and it was pretty full that night, but tables were still properly distanced. We ordered a few apps to start with:Agedashi tofu - pretty solid. It was crispy and piping hot and it came with at least ten pieces Tuna crispy rice - I always love a good tuna crispy rice. This one was unique because it was a crispy thin layer of rice instead of a crispy ball of rice. I really liked it because it meant fewer carbs, meaning not as filling, meaning more room for the main courseTNT Truffle (chopped blue fin toro, caviar, scallion, tempura flakes, wrapped with tuna in truffle soy sauce) - this was not bad but I could have done without the tempura flakes rolled into the middle. The truffle taste was very faint and tasted like fruffle (fake truffle)For the mains, we all got the omakase. This included toro, seared toro, seared king salmon, horse mackerel, amber jack, eel, scallop, uni, red snapper, barracuda. My favorites were the toro, seared toro, seared king salmon, and the uni. My friend ordered hers without wasabi and for some reason, her scallop came out as chopped scallop as opposed to whole and she said it was not good - so just a note for those who don't eat wasabi.I don't live in the area and I'm rarely in this neighborhood but if I do come back, I wouldn't mind paying Ki Sushi another visit."

They seasoned them with cranberries and sweet maple drizzle, something I'm not used to at all but also didn't taste as good as it sounds.  I asked for my wings well done and they were still just lightly cooked.  The sangria is on point and happy hour is a great deal of prices.  I'm hopeful when I return I will try something different and have a different view point.  The one thing I thing they're know for is their astonishing brisket but I didn't have it today.  See ya next time Hudson."

I asked at least twice, the workers would seemingly get mad when I did so even though I asked nicely. It was not busy to the point where they couldn't deliver and most importantly other people coming in were getting served prior to me, which I vocalized. They then said it was given to me and I laughed because nothing was in front of me on my table. Finally about 30mins elapsed and I just asked for my refund. Workers looked irritated and mad that I did but I didn't care since they were both not on top of orders, a simple single Mac and cheese order and gave me unjustified attitude. I didn't even want to eat anything from the place as I lost my appetite on how they handled the situation. I have no reason to lie and the receipts showcase the void and charge I paid while there. I also took pictures of the restaurant as it was not busy."

So when we came to a block party in Mott Haven back in July, hubs took notice of this spot and since then, he's had Hudson at the back of his mind. Whether it's my husband or me, we always like to kickstart our first time at ANY restaurant ordering small plates instead of bigger ones- just so we can find out what makes that particular restaurant tick. Plus to be honest, sometimes I feel appetizers are actually the most exciting part of a menu. Hudson's brick inside is very nice on the eyes and service was pleasant. Hubs decided to just wing it and order in person while I got a few things from elsewhere to share when we got to my Mom's house. Hubs and my mom enjoyed the roast pork, brisket's tenderness and the glaze taste in the pork belly burnt ends, but they felt, the 'cuero' was mushy and missed that extra crunchy skin. Between my mom and my husband, they almost did alright with Hudson."

I asked how many wings you get in an order & I was told 6. When I get my order, there are only 4 wings in the box. I take my wings back to the place and I'm told when you order the Cookout, you only get 4 wings. The cashier was really polite and told me I miss informed and asked if I wanted something else. I said no and that cashier was really nice but that is misleading and it should be posted. For that I am giving this restaurant only 2 stars. Otherwise the food is about 4 stars."

Unfortunately, I was not impressed. The prices at this place are pretty standard for an a la carte smoke house. Obviously everything adds up because you're buying things separately. I also liked that they had unique items like jerk chicken. It was cool to se something different.Here's what I had and my thoughts on each item:Jerk chicken sandwich with slaw- chicken was dry and the seasoning seemed to be caked on. Not too spicy. The coleslaw was very liquidy and had a subtle pineapple flavor. Not really enough to call it a pineapple slaw.Greens - bland no flavor or seasoning.Macaroni and cheese- meh. No cheese pull. Greased up noodles that's look like they are covered in cheese, but the cheese is undetectableBBQ baked beans - best thing I ate. Really good.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing by getting the chicken, but the sides should be good on their own. It wasn't the worst I ever had but I wouldn't go back here again."

The cereal milk flavor is definitely a classic but since it was the holidays, they had a seasonal flavor consisting of a cinnamon sugar pretzel. I went with cornflakes as a topping on this one. So the small is kind of a lot of ice cream! I shared mine with someone else and we only just managed to finish it. The flavor was pretty subtle. It kind of just tasted like sweet but not to the extreme end. Still good!"

I ordered through DoorDash and was super happy to see that this location delivers to me. Milk Bar's cereal milk ice cream can't be beat. If you love a salty sweet dessert, this is the spot for you! You have to get the cereal milk soft serve with the cereal crunch topping. It can't be beat and is a super unique ice cream flavor! The ice cream traveled as well as could be expected and the topping was still crunch when it arrived! My favorite part is the extra topping in the bottom of the cup. It's a great surprise at the end!

Honestly I still can't. But I can say it was well done. 4 out of 5 would recommend to a friend."

She's a huge Christina Tosi fan and bakes from her cookbook at home. Maybe that's the problem now that we have the goods at home our expectations are higher? The pie is as good and addictive as ever, but the soft serve cereal ice cream was only ok. And the compost cookie actually tasted like  a grocery store cookie - one with preservatives."

3665,tT6teP3ZfCAfvdPdDoqG4A,1/22/2023,4 star rating,"Fantastic steakhouse close to Bryant Park, with great food, impeccable service and an old school ambiance packed with history.Ambiance. I found Keen's while searching ""best restaurants in the Bryant Park area"". Turns out it's ranked second best steak houses in NYC by Time Out, which I didn't know until after our visit.  I loved the history of this steakhouse, dating back to 1885 when theater producer Albert Keen founded the restaurant, in what was then the Herald Square Theatre District.  (Who knew!).  Theater club members would come to eat, drink and socialize, smoking from long ceramic pipes which now adorn the ceiling, including pipes owned by Albert Einstein and other notable people. Over the years, the steakhouse has a long list of famous patrons including Babe Ruth and Teddy Roosevelt.  I really enjoyed looking at the framed photos of actresses, theater memorabilia and old theater announcements from newspapers displayed on the walls.Food. We had the seafood plate as an appetizer, and the aged porterhouse for two as an entree, with mushrooms and mashed potatoes on the side. Seafood plate.  The lobster, shrimp and crab claw were wonderful, but the clams and oysters had a slightly fishy flavor. Porterhouse for two. Tender, flavorful, delicious.The fluffy mashed potatoes were excellent, and the mushrooms, while not my favorites, were pretty good.The mezcal old fashioned was fantastic, and the Shiraz blend at the bar was also very good. Service. Our server was very attentive and friendly. There were many servers and table runners, so our order was taken promptly, appetizers and entrees  were spaced well but served with minimal wait time. Water glasses were filled and dishes were cleared promptly.Definitely recommend as an outing with friends, family or a date."

We were sat in a smaller room on the 3rd floor. The steakhouse is really cute and quaint. Its pretty dark and very homey, almost like you're in your grandpa's house lol.We ordered the crab cakes, mutton chops, and a side of the boiled potatoes. They were nice enough to split the crab cakes for us as well as pre-cut the mutton chop for us. They also gave us complimentary bread service as well as celery, carrots, pickles, and olives with bleu cheese. It was strange to me at first, but honestly it was delicious lol. Everything was honestly so delicious. The crab cakes were so warm and fresh. I'm not sure if the greens were garnish or like a salad but I ate it and enjoyed it thoroughly haha. The mutton chops was so good too! The meat was very tender and soft. The greens were slightly sour in a good way. We ate every single bite haha. The potatoes however, were kind of bland to me. There wasn't a lot of flavor and I think that for the price and the portion, I'd pass on this. Overall this was a wonderful experience and well worth the cost and trip."

Decor and history is intriguing and it was cool to see all the smoking pipes adorne the ceilings.Menu was simple for a steakhouse which is ideal, usually means the line cooks can focus on delivering consistent, great results.Our server was attentive and great - no complaints at all.Bleu cheese with veggie sticks was amazing, bread and butter was nothing special.Opted for lobster bisque, prime rib and t-bone. Bisque came first as desired and was great.Prime rib came with an au-ju that complimented it well. Portions were insanely large, if you're not starving you likely can share any of the plates. Prime rib was tender but lacked additional seasoning. T-bone came out a overdone and under seasoned, felt like it could use some herbs or a butter basting.Creamed spinach and mash potato sides were basic and lacked bolder flavors you'd expect of them. Portions again were big and service/lore of the place were great but food was very forgettable unfortunately. Maybe I'm too used to enjoying my own steaks."

But the atmosphere, the service and the food make it a memorable time. Some pro's: coat check, pick your own lobster tank, low lighting, complimentary pre-meal snacks and just on its own that blue cheese is damn good. A few con's: for the pricing the steaks were actually my least favorite part of our meal. I'm not saying they were bad persay but they all sort of seemed to lack true flavor and most of our temperatures were all slightly off. Perhaps they put the wrong plates down at the table but regardless it was not quite up to comparison to other steaks I've had in the city. The sides were sharable but also quite forgettable. Great experience for the service, the ambiance and to say you've been but I will probably seek steaks elsewhere in the future."

Some of the best Whiskey Sours.  Service absolutely amazing!  Waiters at your service! Glasses are never empty! Ambiance casual, dark & has a lot of original decor that is true history!

They do have one of the largest collections of clay smoking pipes which is cool if you're into it and they have portraits of old people on the walls. I thought the food was pretty bland, but my friend seemed to like it so I can't be too harsh about that. My friend and I both ordered the mutton chops, and they gave us bread as a starter. The service is the reason I'm giving it such a meh rating. Our waiter treated us pretty rudely, He never refilled our glasses of water, and it seemed like we were bothering him even though we weren't doing anything wrong. I thought this could be because he was in a bad mood but two people sat down right next to us and the staff was being much much nicer and attentive to them. I even heard him giving everyone else hot, fresh bread while ours was cold and definitely sitting out for a while.Maybe it's because we were a little younger than the other people in the restaurant, but that really shouldn't matter.

I found Keen's while searching ""best restaurants in the Bryant Park area"". Turns out it's ranked second best steak houses in NYC by Time Out, which I didn't know until after our visit.  I loved the history of this steakhouse, dating back to 1885 when theater producer Albert Keen founded the restaurant, in what was then the Herald Square Theatre District.  (Who knew!).  Theater club members would come to eat, drink and socialize, smoking from long ceramic pipes which now adorn the ceiling, including pipes owned by Albert Einstein and other notable people. Over the years, the steakhouse has a long list of famous patrons including Babe Ruth and Teddy Roosevelt.  I really enjoyed looking at the framed photos of actresses, theater memorabilia and old theater announcements from newspapers displayed on the walls.Food. We had the seafood plate as an appetizer, and the aged porterhouse for two as an entree, with mushrooms and mashed potatoes on the side. Seafood plate.  The lobster, shrimp and crab claw were wonderful, but the clams and oysters had a slightly fishy flavor. Porterhouse for two. Tender, flavorful, delicious.The fluffy mashed potatoes were excellent, and the mushrooms, while not my favorites, were pretty good.The mezcal old fashioned was fantastic, and the Shiraz blend at the bar was also very good. Service. Our server was very attentive and friendly. There were many servers and table runners, so our order was taken promptly, appetizers and entrees  were spaced well but served with minimal wait time. Water glasses were filled and dishes were cleared promptly.Definitely recommend as an outing with friends, family or a date."

We were sat in a smaller room on the 3rd floor. The steakhouse is really cute and quaint. Its pretty dark and very homey, almost like you're in your grandpa's house lol.We ordered the crab cakes, mutton chops, and a side of the boiled potatoes. They were nice enough to split the crab cakes for us as well as pre-cut the mutton chop for us. They also gave us complimentary bread service as well as celery, carrots, pickles, and olives with bleu cheese. It was strange to me at first, but honestly it was delicious lol. Everything was honestly so delicious. The crab cakes were so warm and fresh. I'm not sure if the greens were garnish or like a salad but I ate it and enjoyed it thoroughly haha. The mutton chops was so good too! The meat was very tender and soft. The greens were slightly sour in a good way. We ate every single bite haha. The potatoes however, were kind of bland to me. There wasn't a lot of flavor and I think that for the price and the portion, I'd pass on this. Overall this was a wonderful experience and well worth the cost and trip."

Decor and history is intriguing and it was cool to see all the smoking pipes adorne the ceilings.Menu was simple for a steakhouse which is ideal, usually means the line cooks can focus on delivering consistent, great results.Our server was attentive and great - no complaints at all.Bleu cheese with veggie sticks was amazing, bread and butter was nothing special.Opted for lobster bisque, prime rib and t-bone. Bisque came first as desired and was great.Prime rib came with an au-ju that complimented it well. Portions were insanely large, if you're not starving you likely can share any of the plates. Prime rib was tender but lacked additional seasoning. T-bone came out a overdone and under seasoned, felt like it could use some herbs or a butter basting.Creamed spinach and mash potato sides were basic and lacked bolder flavors you'd expect of them. Portions again were big and service/lore of the place were great but food was very forgettable unfortunately. Maybe I'm too used to enjoying my own steaks."

But the atmosphere, the service and the food make it a memorable time. Some pro's: coat check, pick your own lobster tank, low lighting, complimentary pre-meal snacks and just on its own that blue cheese is damn good. A few con's: for the pricing the steaks were actually my least favorite part of our meal. I'm not saying they were bad persay but they all sort of seemed to lack true flavor and most of our temperatures were all slightly off. Perhaps they put the wrong plates down at the table but regardless it was not quite up to comparison to other steaks I've had in the city. The sides were sharable but also quite forgettable. Great experience for the service, the ambiance and to say you've been but I will probably seek steaks elsewhere in the future."

Some of the best Whiskey Sours.  Service absolutely amazing!  Waiters at your service! Glasses are never empty! Ambiance casual, dark & has a lot of original decor that is true history!

They do have one of the largest collections of clay smoking pipes which is cool if you're into it and they have portraits of old people on the walls. I thought the food was pretty bland, but my friend seemed to like it so I can't be too harsh about that. My friend and I both ordered the mutton chops, and they gave us bread as a starter. The service is the reason I'm giving it such a meh rating. Our waiter treated us pretty rudely, He never refilled our glasses of water, and it seemed like we were bothering him even though we weren't doing anything wrong. I thought this could be because he was in a bad mood but two people sat down right next to us and the staff was being much much nicer and attentive to them. I even heard him giving everyone else hot, fresh bread while ours was cold and definitely sitting out for a while.Maybe it's because we were a little younger than the other people in the restaurant, but that really shouldn't matter.

The waiter tried to tell with me that there wasn't red pepper on my dish according to the chef when there clearly was. It was odd to me that the dish was taken back & brought right out which I believe is against food policies. The rest of the food we had was very bland. The staff kept rushing us & telling us that they were closing soon right after we sat down. If that's the case don't have reservations so late. Really a turn off and overall downgrade from the last time I was here a year ago.

I knew it was going to be an expensive trip but money is no object when it comes to enjoying festivities with the ones you love. However, what I hadnt counted on was our server (who was ultra nice) leading us into exploring the menu ""the Nobu way"" - Starting with snacks, then cold plates, and then hot plates followed by dessert. I'd much rather explore the way I want - free as a butterfly and open to have dessert first if that were my preference. Did we enjoy our experience? YesWas the food excellent? YesWas it ""worth it""? That's really an existential question...Our party of 4 paid $750Would I visit again? Not on my dimeOur son enjoyed his time, but he would have been happy just the same if we had a tasting menu at Crapplebee's. Go figure!At least I got him to expand his horizon and try different items outside his comfort zone - like the yellowtail tuna and salmon sashimi which is major milestone because he *never* eats fish yet said those dishes were winners. The wagyu beef tacos and lobster tacos tasted scrumptious - as they should at $20 a pop for 3"" shells.Crispy rice spicy tuna was my fave cold plate.  I wish the rice cubes were a tad bigger. The rock shrimp - fantastic!I loved loved LOVED the Brussels Sprouts Goma Ponzu as well as the Ribeye with Yuzu Honey Truffle. They go down as my two highest rated dishes. I drank two of the best Sidecars I've ever tasted. I was really disappointed the fryer was not working in the kitchen, so Chef couldn't serve anything off the Tempura menu. Our waitress said they're just ""filler not a thriller"" (so in other words no big deal), but it mattered to us. The service was impeccable. Our table never dirtied for longer than a minute. Glasses we're never left empty, but again, I do not liked feeling forced to conform to order my experience a certain way because I like living on my own terms. For that reason ONLY, Nobu was a once in a lifetime experience for me."

FoodEvery appetizer sat half-submerged in a sticky suspension of some variety of yuzu ponzu soy concoction of course, but at the very least I expected the dishes themselves to be well-balanced.  The sushi was probably the best part of the meal, and while the fish was relatively good, the rice was not. The hot dishes were also severe let-downs, overbattered, oversaturated, oversweetened, overdone. Even the vegetable tempura was disturbingly heavy and... Not flaky, lightly crispy, and aromatic. The best part of dinner was dessert, which is always depressing. The soba cha bar was legitimately outstanding though. ServiceThere were literally swarms of servers on the floor, and yet our server was extremely inconsistent. At times overbearing and incessantly interrupting us, at other times completely absent when we wanted him the most, this was an unnecessarily frustrating experience. At any given time the restaurant had at least one conglomeration of employees having a group pow wow chattering away, as nearby tables grew increasingly annoyed by the lack of attention and care. Too many idle staff results in a kind of aimless chaos all on its own in a sprawling restaurant space lit by 20 paltry candles. AmbienceLike the callous and overdressed dishes being served, the restaurant was basically a 500 table shouting match of people trying to declare how important and entertained they were. The rowdy and borderline classless atmosphere only emphasized just how shallow the entire restaurant and its food is. 1/10 nothing like forcing pretend japanese food down your throat while being enveloped by pretend people belting forced laughter. +1 for the bombass dessert."

However, I didn't mind because it was good!The service here was very friendly and attentive. The food and drinks came out quickly as well. Nobu definitely did not disappoint!

My wife does not eat sushi but after looking at the menu she was still excited to come to the restaurant.  After some initial confusion on how to order at the restaurant, you basically tell them everything you want upfront and they pace the meal out accordingly, I put my trust in our waitress hands that I was not gonna be staring at $500 worth of food on eight plates that just came out all at once.I started with the yellow tail Jalapeño and the new style Sashimi, both were incredible.  Then I  had the miso soup and my wife got her first dish which was the mushroom soup. The mushroom soup had an incredible depth of flavor; however neither of us cared much for the massive size of the mushrooms that were left whole within the soup.  Rock shrimp tempura and black cod with miso next. To me these are two dishes that even if you don't like seafood you just order them every time you come to this joint. They had a special that night, and it was the best dang scallops that my wife and I have ever ate.  I've always wondered why restaurants will say that their scallops are sweet?  I've had good yes, but sweet nope, and now I get it!To finish the meal we got 4 ounces a wagyu beef.  Some people have bucket lists when it comes to travel - I got it when it comes to food and this was one of those items.   My wife described it as meat butter and I can't think of a better way to describe it. It comes with sauces needless to say for me it just tasted outstanding on its own accord.When we were about ready to leave, a woman came and sat down with the party at the table next to us.....it was freegin Martha Stewart!  Needless to say if it's good enough for her, that is the golden stamp of approval for this restaurant.I had very high expectations, and they exceeded them throughout the entire experience.  My wife said the customer service was the best she had ever had at a restaurant.  If you don't like seafood, and you have some (ok a lot of) extra money put this on your bucket list and you'll change your mind!"

You can likely get away with 1 appetizer and 1 entree if you want. Prices are also very reasonable, so worth the visit if you're in Williamsburg and craving Thai food."

We made a reservation for 3 on a Friday evening, and it was busy but there were still some tables open. Our server was friendly and attentive, and our food came out quickly. Along with a couple of beers, we got marbled pork rib ramen, tonkatsu chashu pork ramen and Beijing style dalumen. You can choose the style of noodle that you want (soba, rice, udon or Japanese yellow)! Everything was great, and the portion sizes were perfect. They definitely don't juke you on the amount of noodles as some places do. Also, my friends and I were especially impressed by the ramen broth - it was so rich and flavorful! Prices here were definitely decent for NYC. I would definitely come back again if I'm ever craving ramen, and I highly recommend you try it as well."
3706,SxKvgnkMMZdhBJcxxKQnww,10/31/2022,5 star rating,"So good, I miss the ramen here already. I was craving ramen with a less creamy/more soup-y broth, and the marbled pork rib ramen satisfied that craving. The broth had so much umami and wasn't heavy. The noodles were perfectly slurpable, chewy, and thick. I also recommend the purple yam cakes. Crispy on the outside, mild sweetness on the inside."

3708,SxKvgnkMMZdhBJcxxKQnww,7/20/2022,5 star rating,"I've had the ramen here before but wow. Maybe i was really hungry or something but the marbled pork rib ramen blew me away. The rib meat was seasoned perfectly... just the right amount of salt/savory-ness to balance with the broth which wasn't too heavy/salty. I personally would have preferred thin ramen noodles but the texture was still bouncy and good. and price wasn't bad either. So yes, I highly recommend checking this place out and the marbled pork rib ramen!"

3710,SxKvgnkMMZdhBJcxxKQnww,4/19/2023,3 star rating,I love ramen but this was just ok.  The veggie dumplings were good.  The soba noodles felt a little under done and the flavor of the soup was underwhelming.
3711,SxKvgnkMMZdhBJcxxKQnww,7/25/2022,3 star rating,"This is a review for TAKEOUT only, which... maybe that's why it wasn't as astounding as I thought it would be considering all the rave reviews. I got the chicken katsu ramen, which was good, but not great. Considering I had to schlep this home, the katsu remained pretty crunchy and they were GENEROUS with how much they gave. I had a ton of chicken katsu left even after I finished eating it with my soup. Mine had the default homemade noodle, which, again, was good but not spectacular. I think they were a little heavier than normal ramen noodles and also somewhat floppier(?) which doesn't exactly make sense, I realize, since all noodles are floppy. BUT this noodle was just a little less confident than the regular ramen noodle. Because it was so thick, it also very noticeably did not have the flavor I usually get with noodles. Maybe it was that it was harder for the noodle to absorb the flavor of the soup? But that brings me to the soup. This is purely an issue with takeout: we got 7 bowls of ramen and they did not label a single container of soup, so we were out here guessing which one went with which. In the end, four of them looked exactly the same so we kinda just picked randomly. I have no idea if the broth for the chicken katsu is different from the one for the marbled pork rib ramen, but they looked the same. They should definitely label the soups for us so that the confusion doesn't happen, especially if the soups are different for the different bowls of ramen. I'd probably be willing to try Peng's again, but only in person-- I'd be wary of takeout from here."

Cute little hole in the wall with authentic ramen shop vibes.Huge portions- I hate paying almost 20 bucks for ramen and leaving hungry. Perfect amount of noodles to broth ratio. I am a vegetarian, but the pork in the ramen looked succulent and perfectly roasted for hours it seemed. Definitely worth the visit."
3713,SxKvgnkMMZdhBJcxxKQnww,4/30/2022,5 star rating,"The Yelp reviews are amazing and I wanted to see what it was all about.  Peng's Noodle Folk lived up to the expectations.  The beef stew noodle soup had a broth that was bursting with flavor and the beef was so tender.  I don't usually love pork dumplings but I thought they were exceptional here.  The space is small, but modern and clean.  Food comes out really fast.Insider's Tip: Spend the extra $1 for the Japanese Noodle"
3714,SxKvgnkMMZdhBJcxxKQnww,3/29/2022,5 star rating,"It was so rainy and cold, so my coworker and I decided we wanted to eat something comforting and warm. We found this place on Yelp, and knew that ramen was the perfect food for our souls~We both ended up getting the same thing, the Tan Tan Men Ramen, which is a spicy pork meat in a sesame soup. I love tan tan men/dan dan noodles, they are so good, so I was excited to try this dish! I was so happy I ordered this dish! The noodles and pork were cooked great and the broth was spicy and flavorful. I would come here again, even on a non-rainy, non-snowy day~"

Their sushi is excellent and is a constant for our Friday Nights since mid 2020. Alan and his staff are so nice when we pick up our food and their delivery is always on time. Definitely give Junko a look if you haven't tried it.

3723,RdGWCbcxA79G1ZMPVL3SGQ,11/24/2021,5 star rating,I've ordered from here twice and had great meals both times. I don't love how crunch is added to most of their rolls but they have wonderful sashimi and the crab Rangoon is some of the best Ive ever had!

3725,CCcJhFyfdITBtzzeFrZBVA,9/24/2022,4 star rating,"Came to Bella union for happy hour / early dinner! For one, the view on the rooftop is amazing! They have the tables spaced out during happy hour, so it's not too crowded and everyone can take in the view. We didn't have a reservation, but the staff was able to still get us a table on the rooftop at 5:30pm on Friday if we were ordering entrees. The one disappointing part of HH was that cocktails were not included , that was a bummer. But the food and vibe was awesome, I will definitely come back - especially if I'm looking to do a wine night."

Don't expect to be impressed by the food. This was a pretty mid brunch spot honestly. The bottomless deal was actually pretty good. It consisted of unlimited bottomless of your choice of Aperol, Bellini, and Mimosa for only $25, and I don't think there was a time limit because the server kept bringing us refilled pitchers of alcohol even after 2 hours lol. The food was nothing impressive, and we got our food pretty late in - almost an hour after we ordered. Which was crazy since we were drinking so much."

Stopped in after walking for a million blocks as he snapped exterior building photos to his heart's content. We stopped at the sign outside stating the ""rooftop is open, happy hour 4-8 pm."" None words sweeter we obliged. My partner exclaimed ""trash!"" but we have it a chance. Up we went to the penultimate third floor rooftop. We had a couple rounds of the pretty good Aperol Spritz and some simple carbs. Margarita pizza was very plain could have been labeled cheese pizza, the crispy rice salad was good, the melted cheese sandwich was fine. Service was fast and friendly.

Understably the outdoor-most area was closed for people eating food but still wish we could've had drinks out there. My GF said the espresso martini was the best she'd ever had and I loved the Sexy Beast(mexcal based drink). I got the Mr Brightside after which was really not good hence the 4. I'd be back to try food or for a night out.

Comfortable and distanced seating.  Great brunch spot. They give you a complementary brunch cocktail (brunch cocktails are mimosas, screwdrivers and Bloody Marys). The guacamole toast with poached eggs (aka avocado toast) was great. Loved the home fries too. Good natural lighting for photos. Multiple floors. I went for brunch but the hostess said they have an inclosed rooftop area that opens around 4pm."

Incredible ambiance and atmosphere (would highly recommend the second floor), with an outdoor rooftop as well.Food itself was fine, nothing special. The fish and chips I had were soggy and a bit bland. I did not get a drink, although I wish I had given the beautiful bar area and their selection of cocktails. Booked here on a whim for a party of 4 for dinner on a Friday. I've passed the building numerous times before and it's always caught my attention with its wooden facade. One of the hidden gems for a nice date or place to grab drinks. Had a friend come here again for drinks and a date, and they had a wonderful time. Note: As of December, I could only find phone reservations"

Super friendly and knowledgeable staff, a beautiful space inside and out, great food , and tasty drinks. Thank you to our server Gregory for being so accommodating to my boss's dietary restrictions. We sat in the third floor rooftop area which was warm and cozy and beautifully decorated for the holidays.  For drinks we had the Mojito, The Cuban, and the Strawberry Ginger Mint Love Potion. All delicious must try cocktails! We had the chips and guac to start, chips were perfect and the guac was chunky and fresh- just right for me. Then we had the Spicy Western wings which were delectable. Perfect amount of heat and flavor. For dinner, Braised Short ribs which melted in your mouth and Blackened salmon filet that was terrific. They were able to sub fingerling potatoes for sweet potato fries and they were great. The ice cream to top it off really made my night. I appreciate the stellar service and I hope to be back soon!"

It was obvious they chose quality over quantity. The plantains were perfectly riped and fried to perfection. Their fried Yucca (in Kreole we call it accra) was so delicious, even though it needed a tab bit more salt (but some people may like it as is). Nevertheless, I was very satisfied with my food and they have become my new go to for Haitian food. I usually travel to Liden for Haitian food, but now I found a great contender. I also wanted to touch on the rice, that was perfectly moist and their sauce for it was so flavorful. Makes my mouth water. I will be telling my friends, I just wanted to share with Yelp my awakening lol. When I visit there physically I'll have another update!"

I reccomend the tofu bc you don't even really taste the difference! Tbh I feel like there are better Chinese places to order from in the area"

I ended up here because some of my friends only eat halal, ok just one, but anyways we ended up here, because otherwise she would have never known what take out tastes like. she was amused, and my friends LOVE spicy food. the spicy oil sauce thing that comes with the take out they put it all over their food and gobble it up. Its typical chinese food, but its halal, so if you have a friend who has those special dietary needs then yeah check out this place. its not too greasy. They're super busy so your order may take a while. Their corn chicken soup is clear broth with baby corn in it. My friend was expecting an egg drop soup with a corn chowder mixed into it. Their wings are pretty awesome. Not sure what seasoning they use but its uber."

I enjoyed my meal but didn't really expect it to be quite like the typical Chinese food selection just with no pork on that fork lol. The chicken wings on the other hand tasted like chicken that one would order from a halal chicken spot which actually seemed a little weird to me though. One thing I could say about the spot was that people in the neighborhood came in and out of that place. They seem to like it. The lady at the front counter in the other hand seemed a bit on the rude side. She was very short with everyone ordering as well as everyone on the phone. They children was just running around and playing in the kitchen area.

If you want just coffee specifically, there are other great coffee shops in the area but Little Canal has them all beat on food. I've tried the egg sandwich on brioche bun, the hangover burrito, and the tuna sandwich. All of them are very good. Music can be a tad loud sometimes. Also the first time I went, there was a line towards the door (it is a small distance between register and door) and the cashier was having a long conversation with the people ordering (which I didn't mind) but she was ignoring the rest of the customers and then had the audacity to look me in the eyes and say step away from the door, you're blocking it, even though I literally had no place to go. Doesn't really bother me, just a bit annoying for a first impression."

I asked what matcha they had and they had no clue where the matcha powder was from -- If you know your coffee beans you should know your matcha too. They made my matcha and it tasted like they just served me cold milk, when I asked them to remake it and said thank you all she said was ""yeah."" If I'm paying $8+ for a matcha, it better be a damn good matcha. I'm only giving two stars because it's nice inside but other than that, I'm probably never going back. There's better options around!"

At first I got worried it was egg salad by accident but realized they use turmeric or something to add a yellow tint to it. Accompanied with mustard seeds, pickled red onions and arugula---it was ecstatic--on a perfectly toasted multi grain toast. It was so good I felt compelled to thank the chef---instead wrote a handwritten thank you note. My iced coffee had little black flecks in it --- vanilla bean!!!! Fascinating & new to me. The peanut butter cookie was yummy: firm on the outside, like a soft batch cookie on the inner core. Quite hefty in density, I suggest sharing it with a friend. I saved it for a later on in the day snack. All of the staff with very friendly and kind. I almost felt like I wasn't in nyc for a second, with the rush and rudeness of the daily grind. My server Indigo made my day extra special: they were kind and sweet. Thank you Indigo! I sat outside to the left and watched the non-stop flow of traffic and pedestrians. There's no WiFi or laptop use which I think aims at bringing people together. Fascinating."

Then everyone got fired/quit (rumor has it they were not being paid well which is funny considering my latte costs $7.50 so I think they could afford it). Then they closed for like a week and since they've reopened the staff is terrible. They are rude and unhelpful. I come here a lot less frequently now but unfortunately I like their latte the best in the neighborhood. After today I won't be going back though. The guy working the register is just rude and has an attitude. He doesn't greet you when you walk up to the counter and after you say what you want he always says something annoying like ""I don't know, can you have a latte?"". The straw that broke the camels back though was when they tried to charge me $1.25 for a cup of ice water. In the 2 years I've gone there this has never happened. It's kind of insulting considering my coffee is already so expensive. At this point I'm just going to invest in an espresso machine because I don't want to deal with the attitude of the employees there. I've talked to my partner and friends who live in the area and we all hate the new staff. It's a shame because I liked supporting a small business in my community and the coffee is great but they've really dropped the ball since the re-opening."

Matcha was watery and food didn't taste right, got food poisoning. Even gentrified places can't make eggs, sausage and toast right, no wonder they bombed at making a simple matcha. Call it white on white violence but this shit felt like it needed to be in some basic West Village street where the basic bitches go. As someone who dates a white girl, even she said this shit was awful. Threw up my guts after an hour. Wouldn't go again, even if you paid me. Chef must've just fucked up or the food wasn't fresh. Refund? Nah I doubt it."

I went on a weekend afternoon and it wasn't too packed so it was nice being able to easily get a seat and sip on my drink. I ordered the chai latte with oat milk ($6) and it was pretty good but just a bit too watered down for me. FYI, they don't have WiFi here so I wouldn't recommend bringing a laptop to do work here."

I didn't like the fact the gratuity was included in our bill and we barely order so much stuff. It was 4 of us we had a hookah and 2 drinks each and a order of fries and tenders. They include a 18% gratuity and I just felt it was unnecessary it should of been a suggestion. Being that we didn't get much and the servers didn't come and check on us and asked if we wanted more drinks or if we wanted more food. Around 11pm they started charging an entry fee. Music was great and chill. A lot of hip hop, reggae and Spanish. We enjoy the D.J selection of music. Great place to hang and chill with friends"

3771,qYGvJSWrybTrpcL39Iwkeg,7/30/2017,1 star rating,"First off, I just want to let you guys know that any advertisement of Groupon x Livin Social promoting $29 for two people which offers one appetizer, one hookah, and two drinks is a SCAM!! I warned my friend to ask the guy manning the door if they're taking the livin social app special because there's always some fine print and to our surprise of coarse he relays that they're not using that app special so we went to Groupon to see if they had a special and it did and lucky for us they were accepting it from Groupon.Okay so more about Mazarin itself At this place The one appetizer you get with the Groupon special  is literally one appetizer Tazhiki -- there is no other choice under the appetizer list! Wtf /:   Okay fine, the hookah list has a decent amount of choices, although you only get to choose from the ""regular hookah"" list. We chose strawberry and though my friend enjoyed it and called it the best part of our list and i begged to differ, I know good hookah because I frequent authentic Lebanese restaurants and I didn't know if it was strawberry or just smoke. Moving on: With Drinks you'll have some variety and they aren't too bad, but what's more?they are served in a smaller version of mason jars. I ordered a berry drink - is this just ice, syrup and water because that's what it tastes like anyways I didn't complain I just took sip by sip moving on...As for the bill well well well ... I'll certainly post a picture, but for the $29 Groupon purchase you will be slapped with a $10.56 service charge and also tax $5.20 but there will also be a option to tip a suggested $10+As a side note : waitress had a bit of attitude and that may have been because I was noticeably disgruntled, but who wouldn't be ... my friend and I literally travelled to this place because we thought we'd be getting an amazing deal.... not Props to the DJ he's killing it and the only star I gave for this review is for him because he's straight Try this place without the Groupon maybe ? Then you probably won't feel scammed out of your money."

It was alright, but I could've went to better. The cover to get in is $10, however I was told once you reserved there is no cover. Then I told I guess the owner that I had reserved a table and seating ahead of time per the lady, who works there and he was like we don't take reservations after 12AM, but he was able to accommodate us. We first sat in the corner back and then the girl moved us over somewhere else to then tell us to go back to our original spot - which was pretty annoying! The music was good, but ever so often the speaker by us would go out and then shockingly come back on and hurt our ears... we eventually got accustom to it. The hookah was pretty good, but could be better.My recommendation: It was alright, however I will not be returning. If you like spanish music this will be the place for you."

The coffee is very very good. I got some cookies and there are also delicious. My favorite was the almond biscotti which was very crunchy with a natural almond taste to it appeared it was not overpowered with almond extract and if complimented my coffee the next morning very well. I also like their rainbow cookies although they are not my favorite. After I walked in, the place got crowded real fast. It is easy to see that this place is loved and that's why it's been around for so long.Mera's Tip: have a cappuccino"

Everytime I enter this place, people (other customers) just stare like I'm an alien, which is always uncomfortable. Especially for someone who's not caucasian like me. Secondly, they have a sign about mask outside. But they do nothing to enforce that to their regular patrons who often don't wear masks. Today, when I visited, I believe the owner sat at a table with a group of 5-6 other people. Not a single mask in sight. I like their stuff, but I won't be supporting this place anymore."

However, this review is for the LACK of enforcement of the amount of people entering at one given time, allowing at times people to enter without a mask and not making sure everyone is keeping apart from each other. After witnessing two men on two separate occasions inside without a mask I was livid. Especially since one was a chief of law enforcement. Like how ignorant and oblivious can you be. Given that Covid cases continue to rise..I don't understand how people can be so reckless and irresponsible. OWNER please ensure to *not allow anyone to enter without a mask and also address the other problems I mentioned. We are in a pandemic and this is unacceptable."

True old-school Italian bakery with a ton of options for window shoppers of the pastry case variety, which is me in a nutshell. I also received some friendly service while contemplating my options.Their lobster tail was large and flaky, with a nice amount of filling. The chocolate-covered cannoli was delicious as well, with a crisp shell and rich ricotta innards. It would be on par with Veniero's in the East Village if they added chocolate cannoli filling! The cherry cheesecake was also nice and smooth, and not too dense. This place feels like a neat neighborhood haunt, too bad it's not in my neighborhood."
3785,DxeD4Jw3gsImI-olCOB0bA,10/7/2022,3 star rating,We had such high hopes for this well decorated new spot. Typical drink menu. $10 happy hour beers. The food was just disappointing. The burger was just too small of a patty on an oversized bun. The creamy chicken pasta was more like something we could have cooked at home. And the steak tartare was great. It feels unfortunate that otw home everyone was saying how great the fries were. Not the entrees. Not the drinks. Sad but true. Hope to come back maybe next summer and give it another try.

They also serve their burgers on a brioche with red onion and lettuce, tomato and cheese. Fries are top notch.Portion sizes are large and generous. Sodas are canned but served with a tall glass of ice in an ice cold can. Waters are in a glass bottle (which could be colder) and self poured after the first one.The places is really spacious considering the other restaurants in the area. The staff were even speaking French to each other which added to the ambiance.Decor here is well done. The dining rooms are connected but also separate from each other which help the place retain some intimacy. Good location for a date or even a business lunch.

Overall it was just ok for me, some items we ordered were better than others. The mezcal cocktail, Scallop Risotto special were both good but the French fries i have to say were incredible, salty but perfectly cooked and actually were the best part of the meal. But what was really disappointing and left me feeling super bummed was my highly anticipated order of the Beef Bourguignon, classic French dish that any French restaurant should nail. The beef was astonishingly dry and the opposite of tender, the accompanying mushrooms and carrots were obviously cooked separately (sad face), the lardon was non existent and I now wonder if the Beef was even cooked in the deep and rich stew that is supposed to Beef Bourguignon. Will I try Bistro So again? Maybe for brunch, but if they serve Beef Bourguignon like that I don't know if I can trust them to prepare a delicious classic French meal...(sigh)"

As far as I'm concerned, Pates et Traditions had some of the best galettes on either side of the Atlantic. I actually felt saddened walking by their empty storefront on Havemeyer after they closed.Unfortunately we didn't realize that the menu here has been substantially revamped to pivot away from crepes towards a more meat-heavy, traditional French brasserie menu. We came for dinner, but the crepes are now only available for brunch. As a vegetarian, the options were a little limited. The truffle gnocchi was creamy and I loved the texture of the fresh pasta, but it wasn't exactly what I was in the mood for. Although my omnivorous friend enjoyed his burger.Maybe I'm just nostalgic, but I hope they bring crepes back on to the all-day menu and can keep their vegetarian fan base!

We used to frequent the French spot all the time at the other location before they closed and re-opened in a much larger spot with ample indoor and outdoor seating... and everything is as delicious and IG worthy as ever.Here is what you need to know:1. The buckwheat crepes... still the only place outside of Paris and Montreal that delivers on the delicious flavor of savory crepes.2. The space is as beautiful as ever. The vibes are a cross between a tropical paradise and a French cafe. There's heated garden seating and more seating indoors.3. The perfect French Fries...4. Delicious steak tartare and chicken mustard pasta.5. A burger that can contend with the other ranked fancy burgers in the city.Run, don't walk to Bistro So.

I wish I could remember our server's name but she was very sweet. I had the deluxe mushroom burger. Subtle seasoning and cooked perfectly. I also tried my wife's chopped steak (which was massive) and mashed potatoes, both were just as good. We also took two grilled cheeses to-go which I can't wait to start eating. We left just as it seemed the dinner rush was beginning but from what we experienced, the other customers were just as friendly as our server was. It seems like the local ""go-to"" place for good food and a friendly quiet place to sit and chat with a loved one or stranger. While we're only in town a few days, we've already decided to go back at least once before we leave."

It's an old school, straight forward diner (which I love) and the menu has an unbelievable variety.

I ordered the chopped sirloin steak with a side of mashed potatoes and broccoli, and a cup of lentil soup. It was all so delicious!!! My husband had a mushroom burger with fries and it was also fantastic. Our server was really nice too, I can't remember her name but she was awesome. We also took two grilled cheeses to go.

I picked apart the sandwich that I couldn't pick up because it was falling apart. It was just bad. The other half I will take home or offer someone who may be hungry or have less to eat. I don't like to throw away food that hasn't been touch. Next time I will go to the diner thats closer to my home, now they know what a Philly sandwich is.

It was hot and delicious, none the less we are disappointed with how we were treated. We are non Hispanic and have been attending  this spot for a few years.... This is very disappointing! If I could give today's experience an honest review, they would receive 0 stars."

I wish this place well and hope someone with some restaurant knowledge takes over.
3821,WBPbYPBrha8jxeUuqreYpQ,2/13/2017,1 star rating,"Did you see the pictures? That was supposed to be a Philly cheese steak sandwich with disco fries. They didn't give me any gravy I had  to ask, what are disco fries without the gravy? Anyway the phony sandwich was dry as a dessert with roast beef meat. Thats exactly what they gave me a dry roast beef sandwich. Im sitting here with a 13 and some change bill and still hungry. The only thing I ate was the fries, they were good once I got my gravy. I picked apart the sandwich that I couldn't pick up because it was falling apart. It was just bad. The other half I will take home or offer someone who may be hungry or have less to eat. I don't like to throw away food that hasn't been touch. Next time I will go to the diner thats closer to my home, now they know what a Philly sandwich is. This place I used to come to for breakfast alot before I moved and that was always good. Now never again will I invest in a dime in here. F.Y.I. the coffee still is good but thats about it."

Overall, New Capital satisfies my diner breakfast standards, is very affordable, and keeps me coming back."
3824,WBPbYPBrha8jxeUuqreYpQ,4/10/2016,3 star rating,Pretty basic but nothing to be mad about the place looks and smells clean. The staff are nice and attentive. I ordered gravy with my fries and the gravy was really good. I wouldn't might dropping once in a while.

3826,e9OifbKMcKf2mvht6_1pWQ,7/2/2019,1 star rating,Will NEVER eat or order from here again. We were going through the line and my girlfriend asked for guac not realizing that unlike chipotle there is tomatoes in the guac which she can't have. She kindly told the lady I'm sorry but I didn't realize you have tomatoes in your guac can you please take it off. So the lady proceeds to scrape it off the steak and put it back into the container of guac. How unsanitary. Especially if a vegan is to order the guac after it was slabbed over my steak quesadilla. Smh I'm so grossed out about all the other things that can be thrown back into the containers of food.

Pulled pork, white rice, pinto beans, picodegallo, sour cream, guacamole, lettuce, and salsa with chips. The taste was satisfactory. Not delicious nor horrendous. Fair for $7-8. But it was a few hours later that I began to feel worse than horrendous. FOOD POISONING. My stomach could not hold down any other food or water. I had to sit on the John way too often to have any productivity during the day for days (other than to type this review).Needless to say, I will never go to a Moe's again. Never. Even if it was free I cannot risk my stomach to your mediocre, nauseating, improperly handled food.

Now the dumbo manager Chris gets on phone and it's easy to tell he doesn't want to be bothered. No apologies, no answers, just do you want to place an order or what? Total idiots running this place!! No wonder the horrible reviews! And notice nobody responds to customers complaints on here?? They can't be bothered that's why!!!!"

Such a shame because it was a fun, family eatery that was clean and well supervised when it opened. Went there to eat today, 2 hrs later, I'm home vomiting and bad diarrhea. So sick from their less than desirable food. $32.00 for two people to get deathly sick.Beware, health Dept gave them a ""C""...that should never be. Food trays were mishap and messy, staff was impatient and rude. Server handling food had a beard, (long, red) uncovered. Violation! Stay away from this place until they clean up their act....."

I'm not sure if it's laziness or just nonchalance. The place is always a mess and there's always something missing. Either they run out of utensils, napkins or soda. One time, I went with two other friends and they both got a cup for soda. They go to the machine only to find that there were basically no options for soda. There were only three available out of maybe 12 or so. They told one of the employees and it seemed as if he was trying to fix it but nothing was fixed so they were forced to just get water or a drink they did not want.We would also have a hard time finding a table to sit at even if it is empty because every single table is dirty and disgusting. The food is pretty good and flavorful so that's why I give Moe's three stars instead of 1."

With Covid as it is however, even though NY has opened up for having indoor dining, I didn't want to on that day, so we ordered in. I ordered an apple-pecan salad. I personally didn't enjoy the bites of crumbled blue cheese so i took out.  If you like blue cheese, you will really enjoy this salad. The District Burger was the same. Good, though that was my families order. And the wings were ordered Buffalo, but they sent the sauce for covering. I guess that make sense. We also ordered a cheese cake to share. It was awful. Stale, old. I called to inform them and they refunded me the money for the cost of it. She was very pleasant when calling and apologized several times. Would I eat at The District again? YesHappy Eats"
3836,EUQNMT_lU1_oromNfNeWzw,11/6/2022,2 star rating,Food was okay but waitress and atmosphere were nice. They charged 35% automatic gratuity for our party of 7 which is ridiculous. 35%!

3838,EUQNMT_lU1_oromNfNeWzw,12/19/2022,1 star rating,"Let me preface this by saying I have been a bartender for 14 years. My boyfriend and I stopped in here tonight to grab a drink. 10PM on Monday night 12/19. I ordered a mezcal negroni- it was fine. My boyfriend ordered a whiskey cocktail off the menu. When he tried it, he realized it tastes like honey, which he is allergic to. He googled the type of whiskey in the cocktail and realized it's made with honey. Oops. Our bad- but oh well, it can easily be fixed, right? That's surely what we would do for a customer no problem. Well apparently not at the District. I took the drink to the bartender, kindly explained his allergy, apologized for him not knowing, and asked if we could simply replace it with a regular whiskey ginger. Literally no big deal.The bartender scoffed in my face and said ""I don't believe in a honey allergy."" Excuse me? If you are that blatantly rude to customers and don't take allergies seriously, you shouldn't be bartending. I am honestly appalled. You don't ""believe"" in an allergy? What the hell kind of response of that?Our server was extremely kind and apologized and we obviously still tipped him because he had nothing to do with this. We live and bartend in the UES and will make sure we don't come back and let everyone know what happened too. Real nice job, bartender."

My friend and I always sit at the bar and sat at a table for the first time ever. We ordered calamari and the hummus and pita platter which were both decent. I got a gin and tonic and my friend got gin and soda (gross) and they weren't strong at all. Luckily, our girl Lauren was there and blessed us. She is the main reason we go there. She's awesome. All in all, I'll always be back, because it's so close to my job and has good happy hour drink specials.Follow my food instagram @ms_new_foodie for all my foodie adventures."

You're serving people alcohol; get over yourself and show others some respect, even if they're not regulars, your friends, or white-skinned. Wish I didn't tip. Friendliness of staff at an establishment has a positive linear correlation with number of patrons who visit the establishment."

Here's why unfortunately this place got 3 stars. Even though the hot boy pizza was AWESOME, it was cold. Served cold. So was my sausage pizza slice. I asked our neighbors if their pizza was cold and they said the same thing. So there some heating problem they gotta solve. The sausage was so cold. Chilled almost. Didn't make it a great slice. To the hot boy's credit, it was cold but so so so good still. That's how I know it was awesome. The service wasn't terribly kind and they seem rushed or just business oriented. It seems like it could be a hole in the wall fun kind of space with them but it feels like they're indifferent to you.

This was a few steps away from the spot we hit for dim sum beforehand in Chinatown, and was EXACTLY what we were looking for. Forget Prince St and Joes and whatever other hype your friends have told you are must haves in the city. Head straight to Scarrs and grab a slice of cheese and a slice of HotBoi with mikes extra hot honey. Bonus points cause Ja Rule was pumping from the speakers, and they had an El Presidente cold for me"
3847,EUQNMT_lU1_oromNfNeWzw,2/3/2023,4 star rating,"I had been meaning to try this place since it had gotten super popular online and everyone was saying it's the best. I went when on thursday afternoon since I knew there probably  would be no line. I got the square pepperoni slice and the price was $6.70 for one slice.It tasted like a pizza. It was good, definitely not bad but not great. I liked how crunchy and not oily it was, but it definitely could've had a bit more flavor. I would never wait in a line for this though, it wasn't anything beyond anywhere else and everyone there seemed like a tourist if I'm being honest."
3848,EUQNMT_lU1_oromNfNeWzw,12/28/2022,3 star rating,"This place was recommended by our son who did his pizza research, so of course it's our first meal because why not. There was a good wait before we got inside, but once we got in we could see why as there is only 4 tables and a bar area with 4-5 seats so if you have a decent sized group you might be waiting awhile like we did. We didn't do the pay by the slice since we were starving so we got 2 pizzas, one pepperoni and one margarita. Not sure if the guy who took our order was the owner but he was unnecessarily rude the entire order, even condicending when he ask where we were from after we asked for the margarita pizza as if we didn't know what that was not being from New York. Regardless, the pizza was ok...not bad but nothing to write home about and definitely not worth the price. The only thing that made me feel better about my experience here was when I paid the same price for a pizza elsewhere nearby and it was half the size as Scarrs pizza."
3849,EUQNMT_lU1_oromNfNeWzw,12/14/2022,3 star rating,"This pizza spot caters more to the dine in crowd as they definitely were dedicating more space in the oven for those pies. Customers looking for slices only, otherwise, were left to stand in line for an obscenely lengthy amount of time while the rude workers kept barking at us to hug the railing. Doing so prevented us from even seeing what kind of slices they had so the worker coming up to us to ask us what we wanted was useless and comical really.When we made it to the front finally, not much selection but did get a pepperoni square and sausage and garlic square. The fresh garlic with the sausage was miraculous. Fresh toppings and ingredients but the dough could have used some work as the pep square slice was a little dry and burnt. Slices were on the more expensive side -- $6-7 ea. Perhaps consider scoping out the other spots to get your pizza fix."

Jalapeños and hot honey is my love language so I was all for it. Decent price too. Cashier was cordial and honestly service was fast, wait is just long because of how busy they are."

Located on a shady, sleepy block but nevertheless a line out the door? Check. Low-frills divey vibe? Check. The taste itself? Fuhgeddaboutit.To be clear, this is not a bad slice. It's decent. I did appreciate their crust, which was the highlight- they mill their own flour apparently and it is indeed high quality. It's thin, crispy, and yet still folds. But a good crust alone does not a great pizza make. The sauce was way too oregano-y and tart for my tastes. Not a craveable slice for me.Given I stood in line for almost 20 minutes, I was expecting a lot more :("

Not only does it have consistently crispy and delicious slices, it has nice cozy seating inside and even a cute little bar with delicious margs!

The food is perfectly serviceable but it's a at a higher price point. I think if you think of this as a diner, it's way too much. If you think of it as a themed restaurant attached to a hotel in soho it's still too much but more understandable. Food came out slow but I think there was an issue because our waiter did apologize. If you have parents visiting from out of town and staying in the area it's a good bet. They take reservations."

However, the last time I ordered pizza - the woman who delivered it was VERY unprofessional. The pizza box came damaged, the wings container was caved in - she apologized stating ""she was rushing"". The kids were hungry and I didn't want to wait another hour for a replacement so I accepted it - it was still edible. When I checked the remaining order I realized the extra sauces I purchased weren't sent. I advised her and said I will just deduct the cost for the sauces. I gave her $60 and the change was to be $10. She proceeded to aggressively go through her cash to find a $10 bill and state ""I know you aren't going to tip me so here"" - really pendeja? Foolishly, I still tipped her $5.00 because I felt bad. I hope I never have to see her again."

This honorable awardee texted on her phone before pausing to not greet me and take my order. She gave me a big gasp when i asked how many wings came with my order. Oh and a brilliant eye roll when she informed me they didn't have the flavor I requested for my wings. Maybe i should've known the other flavors they had off hand. How silly of me smh. Nikita couldn't ring me up because the text message she received was way more important, a kind gentleman came from the back and assisted me. But wait it gets better! So i returned in 15mins to pick up my order and of course Nikita is sooooo occupied she doesn't even check to see if my order is complete. So i just have to stand there for 3 mins until once again the guy from the back assist me again. Now that i think about it maybe i should get a job at this location. Getting paid to ignore people and text in my uniform is amazing! Thanks Pizza Hut for showing me the values of your work place! Im sure I will never return to such a prestigious establishment."

They offered bread, cheese, fried peppers that was delicious. However, they messed up my boyfriend's dinner and got him something else. I ordered pasta with vegetables. That tasted bad. Tasted fishy like muscles. The wine selection is excellent, however, they charge $65 for a $20 bottle. A glass of wine starts at $15. The next morning we were in a hurry so we stopped for a quick breakfast buffet. It's what they normally offer hotels for free but it cost us $46 not including tip. The breakfast was just OK. Nothing special. No spoons were offered. Service was delayed. Coffee tasted burnt. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. Lots of other options in the area for food."

Seemed like they only had 2 waiters for a busy (marathon) weekend.Service- waited over 10 minutes for menus, had to ask what the specials were even though they were being told to other tables, had to ask twice for a wine list and then waited another 15 min for the wine order to be taken. Lastly a table of the same size that came in after us, got all of their courses well before we did. Only bright spot in the service was the bus boy who was very attentive (kept waters full, offered several rounds of bread, etc).Food was bland. Calamari desperately needed seasoning on the breading, as well as in the sauce. It was also room temp when it arrived at our table. Pasta was definitely not homemade, and sauces also lacked seasoning."

Unfortunately, I should've been my normal pessimistic self. Service was slow and inattentive until we complained (there were only five tables seated). We sat for over five minutes before even getting menus. Also, when my mother asked for the wine list, the Maitre'd said ""in a minute"" and then gave it to my father. When my mother then ordered the wine, the maitre'd then gave it to my dad to taste before I suggested he have my mom taste (the one who ordered the wine).The menus were printed crooked, and had such small type they were almost impossible to read. The Caesar salad made ""table side"", was not made table side. Pastas were average, cappuccinos were tasty, and the tartufo had the consistency of something that had been defrosted and then refrozen. I hesitated with writing this review, but with the whopping price of $300, it was a disappointment. The bright point of dinner was our bus person (referred to as Tío) who was super attentive with water, wine pouring, bread, and clearing plates."

Some days my favourite breakfast sandwich or salad is ready at opening at 6:30am, other times it's not ready till much later and customers are either waiting or leave empty-handed. Hard to rely on this  place as the go to place for my before work lunch purchase if I  can't  be sure  that food will be ready. And, when you  ask staff when food will be ready they're sullen, uninterested and unapologetic.A shame because the sandwiches are good but service  is too hit and miss."
3930,iL9U6DG4ZdPrnMhXeSPIzA,2/16/2015,3 star rating,"I shall only review one Pret ever.  While there are differences across the chain, given that Pret is primarily a take-out place with a fairly standard menu, the experience is fairly similar across the large and growing family of Pret outlets in the city.The Pret salads are healthy but one has to be short of restaurant options or time to get one.  The falafel mezze salad is a good option.    So also their falafel wrap.  The Moroccan lentil soup is always available, but as they have raised the contribution of carrots, turnips and onions in what appears to be their modified recipe, I tend to avoid this soup.  The tomato and feta soup is a great addition to the menu, but is not available on all days or in every location.Pret's assortment has expanded over the years to include fresh fruit, yogurt pots, pastry and juices.  Their registers are run efficiently, often with coordination and intervention from their store managers.  Pret will continue to keep their market share of lunch dollars.  But they will need to keep up with the competition in coming up with new options to keep the menu interesting and the customers coming back."

3937,rrlzpE2hd8vDMtc3BZsNMQ,5/20/2019,1 star rating,"I went back to get a Cuban sandwich. They keep these pre-made sandwiches in a refrigerator. I think anyone who's ever made a sandwich before knows that bread that's been put in the fridge will not have the same chewiness and texture as a freshly baked loaf, if only because the cold and humidity from the fridge changes the bread's consistency. Because of this I ask to have the bread for my sandwich replaced with a fresh loaf, which is readily and plenty abundant, and that I was more than willing to pay the for the added cost and inconvenience. I was told that I could not have it the way that I wanted because the owner does not allow it. I was dumbfounded by this response, so much so that I just had to ask if it was the owner that was going to eat it or me. I didn't think my request to be unreasonable, especially considering i was willing to pay whatever the cost would've been, but the attendant was adamant that it was 'forbidden' by the owner. Jeeez, it's almost like they go out of their way to piss off their customers when it's so simple to just say 'yes no problem' and make some extra revenue in the process. Like I said before, they wouldn't know good customer service if it stared them in the face."

3939,rrlzpE2hd8vDMtc3BZsNMQ,9/3/2015,5 star rating,"Simple, but good! This was the first place I was taken when we landed in NY to grab some lunch. It closed in the middle of our trip for remodeling, so hopefully they've expanded their grill.Their sandwiches are simple, but delicious! We came by each day until the rehab. My girlfriend would order breakfast, but I was more than happy to have another hot sandwich instead. The ham and cheese was my favorite. The Cuban was ok, but being from Florida, I've had better. Theirs was a bit dry. I also enjoyed the salami and cheese. When you go in, the line is typically long. If you want just coffee or pastries, it's quicker to order. Everyone waited for the grill. I really hope they expanded it because it was tiny! There must have been 4 or 5 people trying to work around it. I don't know how they did it!A great local place. Stop in and give it a shot!"

3947,0Tvwk0hvgaY0QVIsZGTZKQ,10/27/2018,1 star rating,"This store is bad enough to make me want to stop going to Starbucks altogether. Not sure why this one has issues with their mobile orders nearly every week that makes them not come through. I can't order food here because it takes 10 extra minutes and comes out cold. Then when you come in and look for your mobile order they either argue that it didn't come in at all or it went to a different store. But they somehow make your drink as requested without ever asking about customizations. The biggest problem here is probably Liz, who consistently ignores customers standing at the counter to jump into other people's conversations. She has that entitled Bay Ridge attitude that makes you want to move to Williamsburg."
3948,0Tvwk0hvgaY0QVIsZGTZKQ,8/9/2018,5 star rating,It's very good place for studying. I used to come here to study with my brother. Staffa are friendly and nicely. Good wifi speed and lightning. Unfortunately you will find a good area to study but there is a noise over there because many people went there just to drink or meet each other.
3949,0Tvwk0hvgaY0QVIsZGTZKQ,8/19/2017,5 star rating,This a really pretty newly renovated Starbucks in a very peaceful neighborhood.  The staffs are wonderful and polite.  The hours are long and you can always park here to study and the bathroom is quiet clean. Make sure you take a picture of the bathroom code if you decide to stay here to do your projects with internet.  Thumbs up!

Definitely bigger tables and actual comfortable leather seats. This is still my go-to spot but I do more mobile ordering now since it's a lot faster especially when I'm on my way to work. But on weekends now, I feel I can stay here longer and enjoy my drink or pastry than before prior to the renovation."

3953,0Tvwk0hvgaY0QVIsZGTZKQ,12/1/2020,2 star rating,The problem I have with this Starbucks as well as almost all the others is that they don't read the order when it comes in Via Uber or the app. Tonight I ordered two Strawberry Acai Refreshers with lemonade and 1 refresher without. Two lemonade one without. And when the delivery came it was wrong if this was the first time I wouldn't be bothered but at this location it happened three times as well as other Starbucks  locations. Uber Eats refunded me a total of 5 times. It's the same thing with the appI have to go back because they got it wrong.  Please read the order and not the first words but  the whole order. Because sometimes the first two or three words of each order could be the same but the others following could be different example two lattes with caramel drizzle one with out whipped cream one regular all the same words except for the whipped cream
3954,0Tvwk0hvgaY0QVIsZGTZKQ,12/13/2018,5 star rating,This is my favorite Starbucks! I love coming here to study and work. It's always clean and well kept. The staff is always so kind and welcoming. Bree and Lesley always have a warm smile and are truly exceptional at what they do!

3959,-__YENukvtf_chmLOUba2w,2/16/2015,1 star rating,I give them zero stars. I will never order from this establishment again or visit the location. I placed an order and when it arrived it was iced cold and wrong. I asked for the toppings to placed on the side they gave me a plain burger. I didn't receive any of the drinks I order. I try to contact the restaurant directly and there was no answer. I called seamless to have the issue resolved they also gave them the run around and finally agreed to give a 50%  discount. As a hospitality manager myself they handled the situation poorly and didn't even offer to remake order or give a full refund. I should've read the other comments before ordering.
3960,ZqhtYd8i4N8DL78GVMwX6g,12/23/2022,5 star rating,"I recently had the pleasure of experiencing Jean-Georges' 6-course Omnivore Tasting menu and it was an absolute delight from start to finish. The service was impeccable and the ambiance of the restaurant was chic and sophisticated.The meal began with a selection of freshly presented bread, including a diver scallop with crispy sushi welcome dish. The highlight of the meal for me was the Venison Loin with Smoked Bacon, a balance of rich flavors and textures. Desserts included a variety of freshly made chocolates, also rich in different textures and taste, which was the perfect ending to a truly memorable meal.Overall, Jean-Georges' 6-course Omnivore Tasting menu is a must-try for any foodie visiting New York City. The attention to detail and high-quality ingredients truly set this dining experience apart. I highly recommend it and give it a full 5-star rating."
3961,ZqhtYd8i4N8DL78GVMwX6g,9/18/2022,4 star rating,"I'm reluctantly posting photos here but they honestly do not do the food justice. Much more beautiful and delicious than my crappy pics! Anyway, Jean Georges is such an amazing treat if you can afford it! We had the 6 course tasting menu which cost around $250. The food is beautifully presented and very tasty. The service is very high end/white glove and probably too good for us noisy bunch!  However, I'm not sure if it's worth the money and as a lot of people said on here, I've had better food for way less but it's awesome to go and treat yourself for a very special occasion."
3962,ZqhtYd8i4N8DL78GVMwX6g,10/11/2022,5 star rating,To begin with I loved the ambience and the service. I mean great service expected in some sense when going to a Michelin star restaurant but I can truly say there wasn't even a single disappointing moment. My husband and I went there for my birthday and were seated right in front of the globe structure and I loved the photo we got. We both got wine by the glass and I loved my Pinot. It was light and flavorful just the way I like it. We asked for the six course omnivore and we weren't stuffed but full after the meal. We started with the 1) amuse bouche - which included the crispy sushi and the wild mushroom tea. The wild mushroom tea was amazing. Unlike something I have tasted before. 2) we then were served the caviar and I honestly thought the preparation was even better than le bernardin. The flavor of the caviar mixed so well with the sea urchin  and crispy potato. 3) next was the tuna ribbons which was also amazing. 4) one of my favorites was the king crab dumplings that came next. The squash and lemon flavors of the broth was amazing! 5) then came the sea bass which had a very flavorful crust. 6) we replaced the beef and my husband got the duck and I the lobster. I think the duck was better than the lobster. It had amazing flavors. The lobster was a much smaller piece. 7. And lastly one was the dessert - it had this super yummy red apple and green apple sorbet  which I have never had before. This obviously was followed by a birthday chocolate mousse cake and more desserts and then we got almond cakes for the next morning. It was an awesome experience overall. Highly recommend this spot when there is a special occasion :)
3963,ZqhtYd8i4N8DL78GVMwX6g,11/4/2022,5 star rating,"Quite a culinary experience! Each dish was very intricate and had great depths of flavors. Amazing service and I was quite full after all the courses. Standouts to me were the ribbon tuna, the foie gras, and the duck. This experience showed me new combinations of flavors and textures that I did not know could be that tasty. Would come here again!"
3964,ZqhtYd8i4N8DL78GVMwX6g,9/9/2022,5 star rating,"Overall great experience! Too much food for me, we did the 6 and 10 course respectively. The appetizers were better in the 6 but the mains and dessert were better in the 10. Wish we had choices on menu items because you were stuck with whatever they wanted to serve."
3965,ZqhtYd8i4N8DL78GVMwX6g,1/1/2023,5 star rating,"I don't see how anyone could give this Michelin starred restaurant less than 5 stars. Quite frankly, I don't know how it's possible they lost one Michelin star because it truly is an incredible dining experience. Firstly, the ambiance is unlike any other restaurant I've been to. From the moment one steps into this alternative reality, it's clear the clientele is chic, refined and sophisticated. There are countless people watching opportunities and entertaining conversations all around to eavesdrop on. The dining experience itself is unmatched. I did the vegetarian chefs tasting and my husband did the omnivore tasting. Both were about 6-7 courses, but honestly seemed like we got ten courses because they throw in some extras. I cannot even name all the dishes I was brought out, but will say that each dish offered a unique burst of flavor. Items such as ""cauliflower tea"" and a vegetarian caviar were so original I don't think I've ever tasted similar concoctions. They also send you home with their homemade almond cake, which is delicious. The service is impeccable of course and each dish is perfectly curated and explained by the server in detail."
3966,ZqhtYd8i4N8DL78GVMwX6g,3/17/2023,5 star rating,"Went here to celebrate my wife's birthday. It was an amazing 10 course dinner experience. Definitely recommend the 10 course over the 6 course. Everything about the experience was excellent. Our wait staff was so professional and attentive. The courses were not rushed and well timed. They inform you at the beginning that it will take about 3 hours typically, and quite frankly the time flew by. Each course was nicely explained. Nice touch at the end on the dessert choices. Also the almond cake gift bag at the conclusion of the evening was a pleasant surprise. Although certainly pricey, the true value is wrapped around the totality of the experience given the special occasion we were there for. Many times these upscale restaurants don't seem to live up to expectations, however, Jean Georges really hit it out the park that evening IMHO. Location near Central Park and Time Warner building is a plus as we enjoyed a nice walk afterwards. Jean Georges is likely a once in a lifetime experience for us but one that will be very memorable.  If I were to nit pick at all about the experience I would say that the entrance hosting could be improved as it seemed they were not extremely inviting when we first walked through the doors."
3967,ZqhtYd8i4N8DL78GVMwX6g,6/2/2022,4 star rating,"Took my mom here for Mother's Day dinner and enjoyed a wonderful culinary experience with exceptional service. We both had the 6 course omnivore menu with a delish cocktail. Amuse bouche:Crispy diver scallop sushi (3.5/5) - my moms fav bite and she would have given this a higher rating. The scallop was incredibly fresh and I thought it was tasty but the flavours were nothing too special. Contrasting textures of the scallop and crispy rice base paired well together. Sweet pea soup (3.5/5) - was not wowed but enjoyed the fresh flavors of this bite. The soup had wonderful consistency that whet our appetites for the meal to come (not too heavy not too thin). Courses:Egg toast (3.5/5) - another one of my moms fav bites and she would have prob given this a 5/5. The caviar was the star of the dish as expected but I personally thought the toast was not as delicious as I would have hoped. However, I had no idea it was egg yolk in between the toasts until I had looked at the menu again while writing this review. I was convinced that I was biting into some type of mild cheese in between the toast layers while eating the dish so I think the way they dehydrated (perhaps?) the yolk to intensify its flavour and transform its texture was certainly special and deserves credit. Yellowfin tuna ribbons (3.5/5) - this was delicious and the waiter educated us that it was the oldest menu item still served (presentation might have changed over time but the integrity of the ingredients/flavour profile was maintained) which was cool. We could taste that the sauce wasn't your average soy/ponzu concoction but I still thought the flavour resemblance was similar enough for it to serve a similar experience as a regular high quality tuna crudo type of dish from a Japanese restaurant. Hence, we enjoyed it but didn't think it was anything super special considering how high our expectations were for this mealGreen asparagus (5/5): this dish emulated beautiful vibrant hues of green but my expectations dropped when I saw this dish being placed in front of us. ""Oh, just asparagus and some morels"" I thought. I didn't think a vegetarian dish could be worthy on a $300 6 course omnivore menu. But boy was I wrong and this turns out to be my fav course of the night! The sauces were deep, complex and delicious. The honeycomb textured skin of the morels served as the perfect vehicle for picking up the tasty sauce it was doused in and the crispness of the mushroom paired so well with the creamy ness of the sauce. The asparagus was cooked to perfection and the tenderness of the trunk was nothing like I've ever experienced. I tried to scrape every bit of sauce left on this plate it was that good Halibut (4.5/5) - fish from most cuisines don't usually impress me but this dish blew me away. The halibut was incredibly tender and fresh - cooked to perfection. But the highlight here is again the sauce (as expected from Jean George). The semi emulsified sauce had rich flavours but was light in consistency. There were tasty bits in the sauce that were like small gems of surprises - I couldn't put my finger on exactly what it was and it doesn't come with every spoonful but created anticipation for every biteElysian Fields farm lamb chop (4.5/5) - another great dish and amazing sauce that I would drink if could. The crispy texture of the crackling riblette was delightful and the chop was moist and deliciousPassion fruit flower (4.5) - beautifully presented. I was not looking forward to this dish when I heard that the center of the flower was caramel as I was not a fan of big servings of caramel but again I found myself scraping off every bit of caramel at the end and wanting more. Only critique would be that the surrounding ring of passionfruit sauce was way too sweet for my preference. Then again the placement of the sauce could have been brilliantly calculated as it gives those with a sweeter pallet the option to scoop up more to enjoy with the ""flower"". At the end of the meal they presented us with a cart of various dessert bites to enjoy. We were also given these mini almond pound cakes to take home which were delicious to have with tea/coffee.Overall a great experience!"
3968,ZqhtYd8i4N8DL78GVMwX6g,7/16/2022,5 star rating,"Before we get going, this place is expensive. So I'm not saying the value is awesome here since there are many good Michelin restaurants, but I was not mad about what I paid for. This meal was so incredibly fantastic. I read reviews before coming here that the food was phenomenal but the dishes weren't particularly inventive. I would agree with that sentiment 90% because there were a few dishes here and there that were intriguing. But it is also comforting to be blown away by familiar flavors prepared perfectly. We did the 10 course omnivore menu and it was so much food. Too much for me. If I went again, I would do the 6, but be sad I missed out on the other dishes. The amuse boché was amazing. The pea soup with the Parmesan cloud was perfect pea flavor and salty. The trout crispy rice with chipotle sauce was my husband's favorite bite of the meal. It was followed by the caviar egg toast which was the perfect combination of textures, salinity, and salt. It's hard to recall all of the dishes, but a few more stand out ones were:-crab risotto with fennel and mushroom (our favorite main dish-langostine with fennel 2 ways-fois gras with olive salt and lychee jellyWe switched out one of our desserts for the chocolate lava cake since Jean Georges claims to have invented it. I don't know if I buy that, but it was the perfect chocolate dessert.Some less awesome (but still good) dishes were-the tuna ribbons with avocado, they said this is a staple and has been on the menu since opening...honestly, take it off-duck with strawberry sauce. The sauce wasn't that sweet or strawberry flavored and didn't add much to the duck. I wish it had been a glaze or something more concentrated"
3969,ZqhtYd8i4N8DL78GVMwX6g,12/20/2021,5 star rating,"Jean-Georges is fine dining at the fullest. You have to make a reservation, often far ahead of time. They have a dress code for the most part, which is semi-formal I would say. Guys, have the option to wear dark jeans or coat, but not required. It's far easier on the ladies I think in terms of what they can wear.It's a set menu that has multiple courses. Depending on which option you choose, the number of courses will vary.Prices are up there for sure, but it's what you would expect in any fine dining experience. The restaurant interior decor itself is really dark, but it has one of those French dining room looks with drapes and cloth tables. I'm not great at description, but you definitely get fancy vibes from it all.The food itself is amazing, and it better be with the prices you are paying. Each dish you can tell was curated and a lot of thought was put into each one. I'm not saying each course will be a homerun, but even the ones I didn't think were amazing, were still pretty good. Everything has flavor and texture. You definitely feel like it's an experience rather than a meal.Everything is worth trying at least once in your life and Jean Georges is definitely worth visit if you are in NYC."

There were tasty bits in the sauce that were like small gems of surprises - I couldn't put my finger on exactly what it was and it doesn't come with every spoonful but created anticipation for every biteElysian Fields farm lamb chop (4.5/5) - another great dish and amazing sauce that I would drink if could. The crispy texture of the crackling riblette was delightful and the chop was moist and deliciousPassion fruit flower (4.5) - beautifully presented. I was not looking forward to this dish when I heard that the center of the flower was caramel as I was not a fan of big servings of caramel but again I found myself scraping off every bit of caramel at the end and wanting more. Only critique would be that the surrounding ring of passionfruit sauce was way too sweet for my preference. Then again the placement of the sauce could have been brilliantly calculated as it gives those with a sweeter pallet the option to scoop up more to enjoy with the ""flower"". At the end of the meal they presented us with a cart of various dessert bites to enjoy. We were also given these mini almond pound cakes to take home which were delicious to have with tea/coffee.Overall a great experience!"

So I'm not saying the value is awesome here since there are many good Michelin restaurants, but I was not mad about what I paid for. This meal was so incredibly fantastic. I read reviews before coming here that the food was phenomenal but the dishes weren't particularly inventive. I would agree with that sentiment 90% because there were a few dishes here and there that were intriguing. But it is also comforting to be blown away by familiar flavors prepared perfectly. We did the 10 course omnivore menu and it was so much food. Too much for me. If I went again, I would do the 6, but be sad I missed out on the other dishes. The amuse boché was amazing. The pea soup with the Parmesan cloud was perfect pea flavor and salty. The trout crispy rice with chipotle sauce was my husband's favorite bite of the meal. It was followed by the caviar egg toast which was the perfect combination of textures, salinity, and salt. It's hard to recall all of the dishes, but a few more stand out ones were:-crab risotto with fennel and mushroom (our favorite main dish-langostine with fennel 2 ways-fois gras with olive salt and lychee jellyWe switched out one of our desserts for the chocolate lava cake since Jean Georges claims to have invented it. I don't know if I buy that, but it was the perfect chocolate dessert.Some less awesome (but still good) dishes were-the tuna ribbons with avocado, they said this is a staple and has been on the menu since opening...honestly, take it off-duck with strawberry sauce. The sauce wasn't that sweet or strawberry flavored and didn't add much to the duck. I wish it had been a glaze or something more concentrated"
3979,kRYrELjgMJeggv0WNb008A,12/20/2021,5 star rating,"Jean-Georges is fine dining at the fullest. You have to make a reservation, often far ahead of time. They have a dress code for the most part, which is semi-formal I would say. Guys, have the option to wear dark jeans or coat, but not required. It's far easier on the ladies I think in terms of what they can wear.It's a set menu that has multiple courses. Depending on which option you choose, the number of courses will vary.Prices are up there for sure, but it's what you would expect in any fine dining experience. The restaurant interior decor itself is really dark, but it has one of those French dining room looks with drapes and cloth tables. I'm not great at description, but you definitely get fancy vibes from it all.The food itself is amazing, and it better be with the prices you are paying. Each dish you can tell was curated and a lot of thought was put into each one. I'm not saying each course will be a homerun, but even the ones I didn't think were amazing, were still pretty good. Everything has flavor and texture. You definitely feel like it's an experience rather than a meal.Everything is worth trying at least once in your life and Jean Georges is definitely worth visit if you are in NYC."

The service was impeccable and the ambiance of the restaurant was chic and sophisticated.The meal began with a selection of freshly presented bread, including a diver scallop with crispy sushi welcome dish. The highlight of the meal for me was the Venison Loin with Smoked Bacon, a balance of rich flavors and textures. Desserts included a variety of freshly made chocolates, also rich in different textures and taste, which was the perfect ending to a truly memorable meal.Overall, Jean-Georges' 6-course Omnivore Tasting menu is a must-try for any foodie visiting New York City. The attention to detail and high-quality ingredients truly set this dining experience apart. I highly recommend it and give it a full 5-star rating."
3981,WWqJRrZ5E_AOaAQT5tWuiw,9/18/2022,4 star rating,"I'm reluctantly posting photos here but they honestly do not do the food justice. Much more beautiful and delicious than my crappy pics! Anyway, Jean Georges is such an amazing treat if you can afford it! We had the 6 course tasting menu which cost around $250. The food is beautifully presented and very tasty. The service is very high end/white glove and probably too good for us noisy bunch!  However, I'm not sure if it's worth the money and as a lot of people said on here, I've had better food for way less but it's awesome to go and treat yourself for a very special occasion."
3982,WWqJRrZ5E_AOaAQT5tWuiw,10/11/2022,5 star rating,To begin with I loved the ambience and the service. I mean great service expected in some sense when going to a Michelin star restaurant but I can truly say there wasn't even a single disappointing moment. My husband and I went there for my birthday and were seated right in front of the globe structure and I loved the photo we got. We both got wine by the glass and I loved my Pinot. It was light and flavorful just the way I like it. We asked for the six course omnivore and we weren't stuffed but full after the meal. We started with the 1) amuse bouche - which included the crispy sushi and the wild mushroom tea. The wild mushroom tea was amazing. Unlike something I have tasted before. 2) we then were served the caviar and I honestly thought the preparation was even better than le bernardin. The flavor of the caviar mixed so well with the sea urchin  and crispy potato. 3) next was the tuna ribbons which was also amazing. 4) one of my favorites was the king crab dumplings that came next. The squash and lemon flavors of the broth was amazing! 5) then came the sea bass which had a very flavorful crust. 6) we replaced the beef and my husband got the duck and I the lobster. I think the duck was better than the lobster. It had amazing flavors. The lobster was a much smaller piece. 7. And lastly one was the dessert - it had this super yummy red apple and green apple sorbet  which I have never had before. This obviously was followed by a birthday chocolate mousse cake and more desserts and then we got almond cakes for the next morning. It was an awesome experience overall. Highly recommend this spot when there is a special occasion :)

Amazing service and I was quite full after all the courses. Standouts to me were the ribbon tuna, the foie gras, and the duck. This experience showed me new combinations of flavors and textures that I did not know could be that tasty. Would come here again!"
3984,WWqJRrZ5E_AOaAQT5tWuiw,9/9/2022,5 star rating,"Overall great experience! Too much food for me, we did the 6 and 10 course respectively. The appetizers were better in the 6 but the mains and dessert were better in the 10. Wish we had choices on menu items because you were stuck with whatever they wanted to serve."
3985,WWqJRrZ5E_AOaAQT5tWuiw,1/1/2023,5 star rating,"I don't see how anyone could give this Michelin starred restaurant less than 5 stars. Quite frankly, I don't know how it's possible they lost one Michelin star because it truly is an incredible dining experience. Firstly, the ambiance is unlike any other restaurant I've been to. From the moment one steps into this alternative reality, it's clear the clientele is chic, refined and sophisticated. There are countless people watching opportunities and entertaining conversations all around to eavesdrop on. The dining experience itself is unmatched. I did the vegetarian chefs tasting and my husband did the omnivore tasting. Both were about 6-7 courses, but honestly seemed like we got ten courses because they throw in some extras. I cannot even name all the dishes I was brought out, but will say that each dish offered a unique burst of flavor. Items such as ""cauliflower tea"" and a vegetarian caviar were so original I don't think I've ever tasted similar concoctions. They also send you home with their homemade almond cake, which is delicious. The service is impeccable of course and each dish is perfectly curated and explained by the server in detail."
3986,WWqJRrZ5E_AOaAQT5tWuiw,3/17/2023,5 star rating,"Went here to celebrate my wife's birthday. It was an amazing 10 course dinner experience. Definitely recommend the 10 course over the 6 course. Everything about the experience was excellent. Our wait staff was so professional and attentive. The courses were not rushed and well timed. They inform you at the beginning that it will take about 3 hours typically, and quite frankly the time flew by. Each course was nicely explained. Nice touch at the end on the dessert choices. Also the almond cake gift bag at the conclusion of the evening was a pleasant surprise. Although certainly pricey, the true value is wrapped around the totality of the experience given the special occasion we were there for. Many times these upscale restaurants don't seem to live up to expectations, however, Jean Georges really hit it out the park that evening IMHO. Location near Central Park and Time Warner building is a plus as we enjoyed a nice walk afterwards. Jean Georges is likely a once in a lifetime experience for us but one that will be very memorable.  If I were to nit pick at all about the experience I would say that the entrance hosting could be improved as it seemed they were not extremely inviting when we first walked through the doors."
3987,WWqJRrZ5E_AOaAQT5tWuiw,6/2/2022,4 star rating,"Took my mom here for Mother's Day dinner and enjoyed a wonderful culinary experience with exceptional service. We both had the 6 course omnivore menu with a delish cocktail. Amuse bouche:Crispy diver scallop sushi (3.5/5) - my moms fav bite and she would have given this a higher rating. The scallop was incredibly fresh and I thought it was tasty but the flavours were nothing too special. Contrasting textures of the scallop and crispy rice base paired well together. Sweet pea soup (3.5/5) - was not wowed but enjoyed the fresh flavors of this bite. The soup had wonderful consistency that whet our appetites for the meal to come (not too heavy not too thin). Courses:Egg toast (3.5/5) - another one of my moms fav bites and she would have prob given this a 5/5. The caviar was the star of the dish as expected but I personally thought the toast was not as delicious as I would have hoped. However, I had no idea it was egg yolk in between the toasts until I had looked at the menu again while writing this review. I was convinced that I was biting into some type of mild cheese in between the toast layers while eating the dish so I think the way they dehydrated (perhaps?) the yolk to intensify its flavour and transform its texture was certainly special and deserves credit. Yellowfin tuna ribbons (3.5/5) - this was delicious and the waiter educated us that it was the oldest menu item still served (presentation might have changed over time but the integrity of the ingredients/flavour profile was maintained) which was cool. We could taste that the sauce wasn't your average soy/ponzu concoction but I still thought the flavour resemblance was similar enough for it to serve a similar experience as a regular high quality tuna crudo type of dish from a Japanese restaurant. Hence, we enjoyed it but didn't think it was anything super special considering how high our expectations were for this mealGreen asparagus (5/5): this dish emulated beautiful vibrant hues of green but my expectations dropped when I saw this dish being placed in front of us. ""Oh, just asparagus and some morels"" I thought. I didn't think a vegetarian dish could be worthy on a $300 6 course omnivore menu. But boy was I wrong and this turns out to be my fav course of the night! The sauces were deep, complex and delicious. The honeycomb textured skin of the morels served as the perfect vehicle for picking up the tasty sauce it was doused in and the crispness of the mushroom paired so well with the creamy ness of the sauce. The asparagus was cooked to perfection and the tenderness of the trunk was nothing like I've ever experienced. I tried to scrape every bit of sauce left on this plate it was that good Halibut (4.5/5) - fish from most cuisines don't usually impress me but this dish blew me away. The halibut was incredibly tender and fresh - cooked to perfection. But the highlight here is again the sauce (as expected from Jean George). The semi emulsified sauce had rich flavours but was light in consistency.

Clean, not greasy, not runny egg sandwiches.The coffee is pretty good, never had old coffee from this place, definitely worth visiting hillside bagels.Update: After frequenting this place for some time now, I had to change my rating of this place, not because of the food, but because of the staff. Either there seems to be some kind of confusion or maybe something else is going on with certain cashiers at this place. This place is ridiculously OVERPRICED, you can see that's also evident from other people saying the same thing on the other reviews. One day they charge you one price, one day they charge you another, one of them was even accusing me of not having paid my order when I had paid, even the cook had to tell that one cashier that I had already paid, the last time I went one of the cashiers charged me around $13 for a bacon and egg sandwich, large coffee and a muffin, anywhere else that would be around $7-8."

DO NOT DO IT they take over a hour and after the hour you call to find out we're your food is and the lady says there making it now.

It was a busy Sat. night, but they seated us reasonably quickly. Our server had a funny-sort of attitude when we first sat down -- perhaps she was having a tough night? (She warmed up to us by the end of the dinner, when she realized we spoke Spanish -- she was clearly not Italian.)The food was not memorable, but was decent. My fish entree was well-prepared. The wines were about the same -- good, but not memorable. We'd been spoiled by a truly bonafide Italian restaurant the night prior much further north up the West Side, so this was more touristy, perhaps, being close to Lincoln Center. We've lived in Italy, so are a different sort of clientele. I don't think I'd want to return or would recommend it. But it was an adequately pleasant Sat. night dinner. However, a caveat: of course, this is Manhattan!, But be aware that it was not inexpensive. Our two glasses of wine & two entrees, no appetizer or dessert, cost $100."

A lot of history here too, this place has been around for a long while.Rez is necessary for dining, as well as Covid Vax cards, as NYers are well aware, and seating is minimal, not too many tables.The service was really great, had a very nice server from Europe who was kind, professional, and caring while serving us, she did a great job.We got a bottle of white wine which was delicious and sweet, I had some Truffle Pasta with Mushrooms which was good, and that's essentially the deal with this spot.4 stars, enjoyable time, good casual dinner choice for Opera goers."

I forget the groups name but they were GREAT and made the night lively and energetic. I ordered the Cesar salad and the spinach and ricotta cheese raviolis. The food was underwhelming and unappetizing. The raviolis were hard and did not taste fresh at all. The only decent thing about the dish was the creamy sauce it was cooked in. The Cesar salad was also a miss, not sure how you can get something as simple as a salad wrong. It tasted like they used either a different type of dressing or the dressing went bad. The service was mediocre. The waitress was kind and polite but service was really slow. It took them a while to take my order and to also check in to see how the meal was going. At the end of the night when we got the check I was really surprised to see that they charged for the takeout containers. Not sure if this is a new thing or a NYC thing but I have never been charged to take my food home."

They were one of the first restaurants that built a cute outdoor dining cabin on Columbus Ave and decorated it (now they have a 2nd dining cabin on the W 68th St side of the restaurant).  During XMAS they had a charming mailbox display for Santa on the side where families could pose and take photos and they always have a rotating live music lineup for brunch or early dinner.  Last Sunday we finally dropped in (without a reservation around 5:30pm). Columbus Avenue is closed to cars for OPEN STREETS NYC on Sundays (until November 14) so we asked to be seated outside in the street on a picnic table under a big umbrella if possible.  The hostess was so sweet, said she had a reservation for a large party there later that night but allowed us to have the table if we ate fast.  We said no problem, we were hungry!  The waiter was kind and professional even though my husband was acting like a jerk, complaining why did the clams in the white clam linguini that he wanted to order was going to be served with shells (said he hates having to dig them out) and saying he was cold outside, wasn't excited by the menu, blah blah blah... I just ignored him and ordered a glass of Chianti and the Bolognese lasagne.  Added on the fried calamari appetizer too.  When the food arrived at our table, my husband's mood quickly changed.  He couldn't stop eating my lasagna and we both slurped up his clam linguini.  We thought we were in for regular NYC Italian cuisine.  We were wrong.  The food was amazing, like we were dining al fresco in a cozy streetside cafe in Italy.  Such a pleasure to people-watch passerbys and see a group of teens filming themselves skateboarding in the open street.  Then a beautiful rainbow appeared in the sky.  It started to lightly drizzle before the sky opened up with a sudden downpour.  We pulled the almost empty plates closer to us, huddled under our cafe umbrella and continued eating. It was glorious.  The rain stopped, the sky turned pink and people (including us) started posing and taking photos in front of the rainbow (which was more intensely colorful by then).  The streets were wet and shiny.  Had to order the tiramisu to finish off the amazing dinner.  The only thing that would've made the evening more magical is music from the Russian accordion player who busks outside near Fairway sometimes. Il Violino is an UWS treasure."

We also ordered dessert and coffee and it was comforting to end the meal with.The interior is tight but great! Very unique set up and it is for sure a good time! The outdoor street seating can get quite cold in the winter but perfect on warmer days.

Been coming here often for take out lunch, work near by.  As the other person had mentioned, the other lady that does not smile is a bit rude.  She is careless too, when she knew the soup is cold for my lunch, and she said to the cooks that forget it, just give it out.  But her tone was very like rude and just don't care.  Sighs, the hot and sour soup they make is always sweet and a bit sour and now cold soup....  After today, I told myself to just start preparing healthier lunch from home."

4022,D8TXbeZE0Mu2W3klMr-NMg,8/8/2016,5 star rating,"They've been my go-to place to order Chinese food for two years! My favorite from them would be the Singapore Mai Fun; I usually order that in a small and it would fill me up after a long day at work (when I'm feeling lazy to cook). Their prices have gone up but that's roughly about all places here in Brooklyn, and it's understandable. I also love their chicken wings with fries (remember to sprinkle it with a litttttttle salt). If you do decide to wait for your food at the restaurant and not call prior to order via telephone, I'd say stand outside because the oil and the smell really clings on to your clothes."
4023,D8TXbeZE0Mu2W3klMr-NMg,12/1/2008,2 star rating,"The food here is your very run-of-the-mill, basic, average Chinese food, but the prices are pretty good and the food is usually prepared well.  Since this neighborhood is overrun with Chinese take-out places, you're better off going to 11th Avenue and trying one of the better places there.The only odd thing is that they don't give you fortune cookies which is always the fun part of eating Chinese food at these types of places."
4024,D8TXbeZE0Mu2W3klMr-NMg,8/3/2017,5 star rating,Good food and nice prices. Your typical Chinese takeout menu items. I usually get the sesame chicken or general tso. Occasionally I get the steamed dumplings. It tastes pretty good.

I got the nova and sturgeon on an open-faced bialy with tomato, capers, and onion, along with the gorgeous latkes, which are technically an off-menu item. Cash only, but there is a CVS with an ATM across the street if you're in a pinch."
4028,LSOpxBBa217HxnJ7VnY2WQ,9/11/2022,5 star rating,"Lightening may strike me, but these latkes were the best I ever had! The onion to potato ratio was perfection. They were beautifully fried without being oily. Just delicious! We also had the nova and the pastrami lox on bialys with cream cheese and capers. Absolutely delicious! The service was quick and friendly. This place gives Russ & Daughters and Zabars a run for their money.FYI - this is a cash only joint."

This place had been around over hundred years, and it's a neighborhood mainstay. It's get crowded, so try to come early to avoid rush hours. Another option is to do take out."
4030,LSOpxBBa217HxnJ7VnY2WQ,5/20/2022,3 star rating,Excellent potato latkes come out piping hot and crispy.Bagel was mid - wish it was fluffier. Smoked salmon and sturgeon were both very good. I split the platter and the latkes with a friend and it was a $40pp brunch after tax. Don't think it was worth the high price.
4031,LSOpxBBa217HxnJ7VnY2WQ,6/28/2022,4 star rating,"I woke up at 6 am to get here so we could be the first people seated. In all candor, it was good, but not sure I'd wake up that early on a weekday for it again. There was a LOT of food. We got the latkes, which were really good, as they were soft yet crispy. I got the smoked sturgeon and cream cheese on a bialy because that's what they're known for. I'm not sure I'd ever had it before, but they did it well. It was really tasty, would definitely get it again. I think the bialy was the way to go because it didn't overpower the fish, and I've been told their bagels are mid. I also tasted an omelette that had sturgeon and salmon - it was alright. Not super flavorful, so glad I didn't get that. My boss also ordered the white fish salad and he's a ""white fish salad connoisseur"" so I'm sure it was good since he ordered it and eats it all the time. The fish is why you come here. It's a bit pricey and the bagel/bread is not really why you come, you're there for the fish and it's very high quality."
4032,LSOpxBBa217HxnJ7VnY2WQ,1/31/2023,5 star rating,"Barney Greengrass has a reputation for impatient wait staff and amazing smoked fish. The latter is definitely true, but the former is a myth. Our waiter was a great guy, and everything that we ordered was fantastic. The whitefish salad is the best I've ever tasted, and the latkes were better than my grandma's (luckily, she isn't on Yelp). I wasn't able to get a photo of the black-and-white cookie (I scarfed it down too quickly), but it's definitely one of the best in the city. Barney Greengrass is 100% worth the 30-45 minute wait. Highly recommend!"
4033,LSOpxBBa217HxnJ7VnY2WQ,5/31/2022,5 star rating,"This restaurant came highly recommended by Anthony Bourdain in his - A Cook's Tour by Anthony Bourdain. By virtue of that, Barney Greengrass became a MUST visit spot when were in the Upper West Side. A 15-minute easy walk from the entrance of the American Museum of Natural History. We were tired and hungry for some good lunch before heading out to Central Park. We were lucky to be seated right away. The seating area is a little crammed space in the back with few tables tight next to each other. Here everyone who comes, looks like they come for the taste of the food and not the ambience. The waiter was quick enough to take out order. We ordered the fresh squeezed orange juice right up. It was refreshingly tasty on a humid summer day. We knew what to order and were looking forward to tasting the food to see if the reviews were indeed spot on. We ordered latkes, sturgeon and salmon scrambled eggs with onions on a everything bagel, hot pastrami sandwich, white fish and salmon on a pumpernickel sandwich. Latkes came with applesauce and sour cream - very well prepared and I liked the combo with latkes. Enjoyed every morsel of it. The scrambled eggs with fish were delightful. A very clever use of smoked fish for breakfast. I learned from Anthony Bourdain that the sturgeon is the king of smoked fish, and it has a delicate buttery flavor. I could see the chef making sense, and sturgeon was a good pairing with the salmon. Normally, I wouldn't have thought of mixing two fishes in a dish, but it worked well here. A+ dish. I was most looking forward to the white fish and salmon sandwich. But we weren't wowed by it. It was a good, passable sandwich for lunch. I'm not sure if I'd order this again. Let's take a moment to talk about the Hot Pastrami sandwich here. Holy Moly! When restaurants and delis around the country are talking about pastrami sandwiches, they clearly have no idea what they are smoking. They need to take a page from here. The meat had a unique smoked flavor, I've never had before. We were full from all the food we'd ordered. But we didn't have the heart to waste any of that good pastrami. We loved the Pastrami at Katz as well. Both unique in their own way, still special enough to go back to both. Head to head though, Barney Greengrass Pastrami won over my husband because of the meat to bread ratio. He is a lover of moderation, and this sandwich worked best for him. For me though, I'm happy to have the Pastrami Sandwich from Barney Greengrass for lunch, then head over to the lower east side and dig into the Pastrami sandwich from Katz's Deli for dinner. Who says, I can't relish both.."

Enjoy the brusque service, it's done with at least half a wink. The line will move quicker than you imagine, and be ready to order as soon as you sit down -- this is not, exactly, a relaxing breakfast. But that's more than ok."

The wait staff was impatient & inconvenienced to wait on us. There's a terrible sewage odor that permeated the back area where I was seated. The food was stale and bland. It's as if they are reheating old food and don't have the proper personnel in their cooking line. The seats and tables weren't wiped down, they were dirty with stains on them. The utensils didn't seem clean either. Management doesn't seem to care and if it weren't for the location this place would have shut down a long time ago.Years ago this place had standards and the food was decent, now it seems like it's a prime candidate for a Gordon Ramsey television makeover.Avoid. Do not come to eat here unless you want to throw your money away."

We got sat right away and the server greeted us and took our order. I requested decaf coffee, and she went out of her way to brew a fresh pot. For my meal, I opted for the corned beef hash & scrambled eggs. And, yes, I prefer the canned stuff, to home made. It came with hashbrowns, and I ""upgraded"" to an english muffin. Everything was pretty damn good. And the portions were more than enough. The english muffin was pretty big. Maybe people need to come in around this time, and not intoxicated, for a better meal."

There was on bar/cafe on every corner but I was kind of craving an old diner. That's when I spotted the Kellogg's Diner. It was the perfect spot to rest and get dinner. My server was awesome (I'm sorry I forgot her name but she was wearing a rainbow/pride bandana on her head). She was so nice and attentive. She checked on me often. I ordered the French Onion Soup and a Deluxe Cheeseburger. Everything was delicious and the portions were big (look at all those fries!). The mens room had a lot of graffiti in it but I thought it was kind of cool in a ""Brooklyn/NY"" kind of way. The smell, however in there, however,  was horrific -- but I had to go on my way out, so it wasn't THAT big of a deal. I still loved the place."

We ordered the Kellogg Benedict (Irish/cornedbeef hash) and grapefruit juice.  the juice was the color of mixed cranberry and orange juice (from a fountain) and tasted like old orange or that the lines hadnt been cleaned or flushed- maybe ever. the glass sat untouched after the first sip and the server never came to check or inquire.I think a classic Benedict would have been acceptable, the food arrived quickly and fast but the Kellogg Benedict was made with canned corned beef-and tasted like what I presume cat food may taste like. it was terrible. the server never came to check on us and then dropped the check. Less than 1/4 of the food on our plate was consumed.  $60+ for lessthan great service and worse food. 10/10 would never go back."

I was drunk and thought the food was bad that's how bad it was. I got a corn beef omelet and the corn beef was basically Canadian turkey bacon or something. The corn beef were long strips instead of actual corn beef. Omelets were really dry. The chicken fingers seemed like they were picked up from the frozen aisle at a nearby grocery storeYou're really better off getting a sandwhich from the deli around the corner. Did I mention the price? Everything is so over priced. It was around 7 dollars for 2 eggs.."

I try not to get too fancy with diner food bc of course it's diner food and I'm lover of diners.  They just need to work on getting the food out cooked and not rushed . 10 minutes into eating my food I started to feel a bit nauseous. My server was kind enough to remove the item from the bill and grab me a gingerale. I chose not to order anything else. I'll actually go back and try a different item and ask for everything to be well done

Not the cleanest, mediocre service, but it's open til 4AM with a menu that covers everything, so excellent for late-night hunger pangs/drunk meals depending on your personality. Also, I know I said mediocre service, but orders came out correct, questions got answered, and waters were refilled. They're just not overly friendly. One negative point is their limited pie flavors.What I Ordered:Rigatoni w/ Meat Sauce- pretty large portion (or it's an optical illusion with the plate). My eating partner devoured it pretty quickly.Kellogg's Burger Deluxe (sub Turkey)- LARGE patty, the bun couldn't even handle it. Tomatoes = soggy & slippery bun. Toppings kept falling off but were good on their own, esp fried onions. Bacon was more crunchy than crispy but satisfying.Sweet (Potato) Fries- super crispy and not overly sweet. Inconsistent portions though.Cherry Pie- a pretty hefty slice, right at the intersection of tart + sweet. I do wish it was toasted/warmed up though."

The mac and cheese is a personal favorite of mine...soooo creamy and the portion is massive! If you have friends visiting the area, are starving at 3 AM, or just want a quick, chill spot to eat, come here.Look, it's not the fanciest place in Brooklyn, but it's open 24/7 (relatively), the bathrooms are clean, the booths are comfortable, and it's in a great central location for Williamsburg/Bushwick nightlife goers and workers. I personally think the food is tasty and I've never had an issue with the service even though it can get a tad slow at times. I've had one or two delivery issues before because they don't have drivers working 24/7, but aside from that, this is a local fave for a reason."

Unnecessary, rude, and straight up mean. Apparently a puppy - NOT MINE- (owner is an Asian female) accidentally peed on their already dirty a$$ stained black carpet in their entry way. SO IT WASNT EVEN ME - how f*cken racist!!I actually heard her profusely apologize, which I guess, that went nowhere. 1 - that's plain racist bc I'm not even the owner of the dog. 2- Two hands is a dog friendly place, accidents happen. 3 - hope he didn't spit on our food.Not sure how to respond to the response to my comment so doing it here.  Let me clarify, the racial comment I'm making is because 1 - the dog is not my dog (I am an Asian female which happened the owner of the dog also was)2 - I wasn't even there when it happened3 - why are you focusing on profanity vs the inappropriate actions of your chef. If you're genuine about discussing, why are you not DM'ing me. No one should be treated the way your chef treated me!I am not condoning the behavior of a dog urinating on the carpet. My response is to the actions of your chef that were out of line. He came out of the kitchen to scold me - I wasn't even there! Did he think I was the person with the dog when that happened? HE DIDNT EVEN GIVE ME A CHANCE TO SPEAK BEFORE HE SLAMMED THE KITCHEN DOOR  FACE AND WALKED AWAY. That is NO way to treat a customer. You're essentially saying your chef scolding and slamming the door at me is justified? This is absurd. Needless to say, I will not returning; seems you have turned this on me for complaining about the actions of your chef and focusing on the action of a dog"

No frills, just good yakitori and an incredible unagi don.This is one of those places that you probably won't pay much attention to. It's unassuming, just kind of looks like any other restaurant. However, behind these doors is a quaint little yakitori restaurant.Looks like a throwback to a 90s Japanese restaurant. They serve sushi, yakitori, noodles, etc. but the yakitori is definitely the highlight here.The salmon belly is awesome but you can't really go wrong with any of the traditional skewers. Their Nagoya Chicken Wings are definitely worthy of a shot. They're nicely crispy, there's this sweet/savory glaze that goes over it. It's not your traditional chicken wing but you may need to get multiple orders of this. I don't like my wings sauced personally but these I'm okay with it.The best thing here though is the Unagi Don or eel rice. It comes in a set for 2 and it's definitely an experience if you've never had this before. The eel fillets are brought over in the pot and then they drizzle the sauce in. The server will mix it all up for you, top it with some seaweed and then dish it out. You can eat it like this, they also offer wasabi and scallions and finally - a dashi broth to mix it in with. So it's like an unagi don three ways. Every bite will be sweet, savory, umami bonanza. Here's the kicker, I don't even care for eel myself.If you're into eel or have ever thought of giving it a try - this is place. If anything, people would probably rather I didn't write this review. The food here is so good, it's probably why everyone's kept it a secret this long."

The cashiers n crew were rude...had no care for the customers time and I had to ask to order after waiting so long. I get that it gets busy with mobile orders but someone gotta put the in store customers 1st.

4071,qtaJjsSA6PbN0UA-3g51hg,9/1/2019,1 star rating,The line does not move at all. We waited for over an hour.. after we finally ordered ..we got to the window to pay just to be informed that the card system went out. The manager was very rude and did not want to accommodate us. Terrible customer service.
4072,qtaJjsSA6PbN0UA-3g51hg,1/31/2021,1 star rating,This place is a complete disaster they always take at least 30 minutes to get you through the drive-through and it's been like this for years. If it were not for my friend that asked me to pick up food from this location I would never buy from here again!!!

The service at this Wendys can be a bit slow but they are getting better at it. The store just went through a major renovation and frankly it looks dope.However they forgot to give me water twice and lines are too long..."
4074,qtaJjsSA6PbN0UA-3g51hg,12/9/2012,1 star rating,Well did not really much care to go anywhere far and since I am in the area some quick fuel could not hurt or at least so I thought1. The Monterrey ranch crispy chicken sandwich does look nor taste like any thing the website is claiming it to be (pictures to follow) if you cannot or aren't even able to reproduce an advertised product you are selling at least 90% as seen in it's picture then please kindly stop selling it until such a time comes when you are indeed able to do so2. So sick and tired of companies hiring people who clearly never even once went to an ethics course as well as customer service training or any professional training for that matter just for the sake of looking good in the public's eyes or well look see we're pro helping out the so called minorities first of all hate to say it but if a person comes to work acting a certain way/gossiping when they should be working as you are on the company's time chances are that you know absolutely nothing about servicing people nor do you even give a damn about treating people with the utmost gratitude that are supporting the business which in turn provides you with a job3. Put some bloody gloves on your filthy hands when serving food that is especially true when you have those extremely long disgusting and gross nails4. And if you are not happy with your job you can always quit the pay is not great I know I have worked in such places before myself but after all no one ever told you to go out and purchase the most expensive/fanciest clothing each and every time you get your check you can always skip a few weeks from time to time don't believe that it will truly put any sort of dent in Michael Jordan's pockets if you don't also working in a fast food was never designed with the purpose of working there forever but merely a stepping stone to get some place else in life the saying is as much true back then as it is for now5. And of course I cannot stress enough once again please kindly get rid of people with attitude problems it should be all about customer care and not about what ever problems they are having some place else (hence why one should never ever eat from people who have very little love in their hearts and mind as I for one find it makes the food taste terrible)

They told me tomatoes done come on jr bacon cheese burgers it has to be requested. Not to mention the burnt bacon bits I received. Horrible service but i guess thats how they treat paying customers in the neighborhood.  Its ok I'll travel elsewhere to my fav fast food restaurant no matter how inconvenient it is for. Here's a tip get new management who cares about customer satisfaction! Bc the big black guy is horrible!!!"

The dishes are beautifully presented and prices are reasonable. The atmosphere is sophisticated and service is excellent.  I highly recommend the enchiladas en salsa verde. The enchiladas were stuffed with savory pulled chicken. They offer salsas with various degrees of spiciness. They were all tasty!Overall, 4 stars for the great ambiance, food, and service."
4077,ziIb68Res3eMw7fz83yFxw,1/14/2023,4 star rating,"This was my first Michelin star dining experience, and maybe my expectations were too high, but this place was solidly good but not rave-about-it amazing. They brought these little crispy things (not sure of the name) and salsas as a starter, on the house. They were okay. We ordered the sangria (both kinds), ceviche, lengua tacos, and pescado tacos. The sangria was alright. The ceviche was excellent -- definitely don't sleep on that one! Both tacos were solidly good but nothing life-changing. For dessert we tried one of their homemade ice creams. Also delicious, but not incredible. Everything was reasonably priced; the service was good; it was a very nice, low-key, unpretentious atmosphere; and we were seated immediately upon arriving for our reservation. No real complaints but not spectacular either. Don't come in with sky-high expectations and you'll be quite pleased."
4078,ziIb68Res3eMw7fz83yFxw,4/8/2023,4 star rating,"We walked in on a Friday night a bit before 7 PM! We were told the wait was going to be around an hour but it actually ended up only being around 10-15 minutes! They serve some free sort of chip corn puff thing at the start with 3 different salsas, which were pretty yummy & a nice texture. I ordered the Enchiladas de Pollo en Salsa Verde, which were tasty (although not necessarily outstanding compared to other cheaper ones I've had). My friends also ordered Enchiladas de Pollo con Mole de Piaxtla and Mole de Piaxtla. I tried a bit of the Mole de Piaxtla and it was pretty good & the chicken was tender. I also split an order of the lengua tacos with a friend - this was probably my favorite dish! The lengua was super tender & flavorful. We also got tres leches to split at the end & it was decent as well! I'd definitely come back to try more of the dishes and it's a great spot in LIC! Some items are definitely a bit overpriced (like guac is $18)."
4079,ziIb68Res3eMw7fz83yFxw,12/28/2022,4 star rating,"My fiancé did a reservation here because the place has a Michelin star, we were super excited as we hadn't tried one yet. My first impression was wow it's really cold in here.I feel like they did not prepare the restaurant with enough time before it opened. We were there for over an hour and it was still cold.We started off with the skirt steak tacos which were about $16 and brought two tacos. The tacos were very flavorful, small yet mighty.We then proceeded to have the jaiba tostadas which was basically crab on top of a small hard shell tortilla. The flavor was amazing but the portion was very small that was about $24. I suggest getting this as an appetizer.I proceeded to get a raspberry mojito which was absolutely amazing. It didn't have much alcohol though. For dinner I had the enchiladas de pollo with salsa verde (green sauce) it was very flavorful and definitely one of the biggest portions on the menu.I would probably get it again.My fiancé had the mole, he stated the chicken was fall of the bone and very flavorful. The restaurant was decorated nicely, the only thing I did not like about the layout is that the bathroom is downstairs by the kitchen. It was definitely a nice experience and may consider coming back here again at some point."
4080,ziIb68Res3eMw7fz83yFxw,3/7/2023,4 star rating,"Came in for brunch on a Saturday at around 11 and even without a reservation there was plenty of seating available. Realized after we came in that we'd actually been to the restaurant before in 2016 (although the area was way different back then) and from what I can recall, the food hasn't changed much which says something for their consistency. The crab tostadas tasted fresh and had a nice balance of flavors and the tacos Al pastor were tasty as well. Chicken enchiladas were good. Guacamole was well made. I would say everything here is very solid but nothing is super noteworthy; additionally, it is pretty pricey for Mexican food (I feel like I've had Mexican food just as good but for a lot cheaper elsewhere)."

We ordered the brisket tacos, the pastor, chips and guac, and the fish ceviche The ceviche was extremely delicious! And the pastor taco was my fav. We were seated immediately and the service seemed a little rushed. Granted we all like our food quickly, but I wanted to enjoy and savor the moment."
4082,ziIb68Res3eMw7fz83yFxw,11/6/2022,5 star rating,"Celebrated a friend's birthday here and it was as excellent as I remember it. Casa Enrique is well deserving of its eight year+ Michelin rating. During the pandemic, they added outdoor seating. Usually there's a wait but we were lucky on a Tuesday night. I parked out front and we were seated immediately. The service is top notch- friendly, efficient and welcoming. We shared a bottle of French rose ($46) and their homemade chips and guacamole ($18). My chicken mole de piaxtla ($27) had fresh ingredients and was bursting with flavorful, complex mole flavor. I can see why helpers rave about their tres leches ($10) It's milky, creamy and delicious, enough to share. The prices are fair for a high quality, Michelin rated restaurant."

4084,ziIb68Res3eMw7fz83yFxw,2/4/2023,4 star rating,"Not sure how I feel about the cafeteria style seating & white walls, but when you're a Michelin star restaurant and the food is good I guess you can get away with it. Reservations highly recommended, this place is small. I walked in on a Friday night around 8pm, waited around for about 20 minutes and some seats opened up at the bar. They have 2 small bars, approx 6 seats at each, we sat at the upper bar. Our bartender Jamie was great, very friendly and made us some awesome spicy margaritas that aren't on the menu. For starter we had the fried oysters and steak tacos, both were delicious. The oysters were very tasty and something different, worth a try. I didn't love the tortilla the tacos were served on, they were very thick, the steak itself was very soft, cooked perfectly. For entree my date and I shared the lamb shank which was huge, served with rice, beans, & tortilla.It was very good, tasted similar to a lamb curry. For dessert we shared the tres leche and Jamie made us some delicious after dinner cocktails."
4085,ziIb68Res3eMw7fz83yFxw,12/2/2022,5 star rating,"The food was absolutely delicious!! Their flavors were spot on! We wanted to order everything on the menu and was sad we are only two people. Clearly that didn't stop us and we still ordered a bunch of stuff: guacamole, toastadas de jaiba, tacos de pescado, de pollo en salsa verde, and the mole de piaxtla. The tostadas was the weakest dish and everything else was not rankable. All so equally satisfying and delicious. The enchilada was the best I've ever had and don't shy away from the mole because of the chocolate!! Their fresh fruit frozen drinks are also definitely worth ordering, I ended up having more than I planned! Yum! I want to come back to try chile relleno qnd desserts."

Listen, I was TOO polite and TOO calm.........Still, the older man got fed up for no reason and had the audacity to YELL AT ME!!!!!!!! Saying that it was MY FAULT the drink didn't taste the way I wanted and actually said: I SHOULD CLEAN THE COUNTER........ He remade my drink 3 times. I got my money back at the end.

The staff will do their best to make your coffee taste good and be exactly what you ordered. You typically don't have to wait too long on line here. If there are two or more customers  in the store  another associate will quickly jump on the second register to take your order. I appreciate that considering I'm usually on my way to or from the 4 train when getting my coffee. It's a time saver for sure.Lastly they have had my flavor bagel available each time I've ordered it so far. I mention this because I've been at Dunkins in other locations and have had to order my backup or back up to my back up bagel selection.Thanks Dunkin!
