1,a-hVnSTC12MY5L3t9yOSJw,12/12/2015,4 star rating,"Placed a pick-up order here last night for five adults. Was ready when we arrived within 15-20 minutes, as promised. Staff was friendly and went over the order to make sure all items were there. Received free sesame chicken dish since the total cost was over $40.00 I am a big fan of Chinese food, as indicated by the number of reviews of such establishments.  IMO Eastern is above average. My wife, who is very particular was very happy with her selection, plain lo men and steamed dumplings.  I was surprised by her reaction, because usually she always seems to find something wrong.  She exclaimed several times between mouthfuls how flavorful all the dishes were. We shall return!"

Egg roll arrived soggy and they forgot to add the hot sauce and mustard. I double checked and it was indicated on the receipt from seamless. Called up the restaurant the gentleman did offer to send the delivery guy back at a later time but I refused simply because my food would be cold by the time he arrived.
3,a-hVnSTC12MY5L3t9yOSJw,10/22/2011,2 star rating,Not the best of places. Food is ok and you get what you pay for. The staff is nice and friendly. Could do a better job at keeping it clean.
4,a-hVnSTC12MY5L3t9yOSJw,10/16/2011,1 star rating,"I had once eaten here a fairly long time ago and vaguely remembered some sort of stomach problem, but, since I occasionally find a cheap, off-the-beaten-path Chinese restaurant that DOESN'T make me ill, I weighed the risk and jumped headlong to danger anyway, thinking that maybe gastric lightning wouldn't strike twice.  Also, since this is a take-out place with a half-dozen, or so, tables to dine-in, I figured that, logically, eating-in might mitigate on any desire on the part of management, i.e., the cook, to take any chances on grossing me out.  Plus, all workers there seemed like family, also mitigating in my favor.  W-R-O-N-G !!!!Shrimp in garlic sauce is my benchmark in comparing Chinese restaurants.  I thrust forward with my terrible swift fork at the first shrimp, which was large, plump and tender - and smelly.  Yes, it had that fish smell that we get warned about.  But, stupid me, after sinking my teeth in, I shrugged and swallowed anyway - and thoughts of the cook's backward shuffle to a big bag with big eyes fixed on me got me to thinking that maybe my being poisoned here twice in a row was no accident.  The second shrimp was tender and sweet but the third was undersized and tasteless.  Conclusion: Taking one from Group A, Group B and Group C in this place means the cook takes one each from the Good, the Bad & the Ugly batches."

But for a storefront place, this place ain't bad for the average General Tso's or beef & broccoli. Friendly staff that gets you your food quickly. Where else can you get a whole fried chicken with steamed broccoli. The diner has funny ideas about what fried chicken looks like. And lets not mention McDonald's processed mystery meat concoction. Be bold, and be satisfied."

9,a-hVnSTC12MY5L3t9yOSJw,1/23/2016,1 star rating,This place is the WORST. I waited 2 hours for my order and they cancelled it without even notifying me. Don't bother with this shit hole. Go elsewhere!

11,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,12/23/2019,5 star rating,"I had no idea this place existed until my friend dragged my reluctant and cold self down the street after church for a taco. Couldn't say no to tacos... obviously. Glad I didn't because this is one of the BEST chicken tacos I've had in NYC. Loaded with meat, bursting with flavor, everything tasting fresh... they don't skimp on the food here.I can only attest to the chicken tacos - and that was worth me rushing to Yelp to give them a good review. FWIW my friend told me the steak tacos and the chicken quesadilla are her go to's."
12,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,5/27/2022,5 star rating,Very small place but who cares. Grilled Steak bowl. That's all I care about! The delivery service is the fastest.
13,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,9/10/2021,1 star rating,"Yayks, At the time I reviewed this place the place had 4.5 stars.I ordered al pastor bowl. That thing tasted nothing like al pastor. The meat lacked any flavor (probably boiled pork). The cheese and beans were equally bad and had very poor flavor. I couldn't even finish 1/4 of the meal and I was hungry, the rest was wasted. Not authentic mexican food and definitely not good food to eat."
14,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,3/14/2020,5 star rating,"Ten stars for their steak taco . (I added guacamole and some jalapeños in addition to the basics  ) . The steak was extremely tender and a subtle gravy saturated the entire burrito adding some extra flavor. The rice and black beans were also very fresh and seasoned to perfection creating a perfect texture . As for the burrito wrap itself, mmmmm it was soft , non chewy and even oddly glistened abit for the added visuals . The restaurant is enough to sit about 8-10 people and is relatively chill. I might make this my go to Mexican spot when in Brooklyn ."
15,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,2/16/2022,4 star rating,"Came here after a basketball game and it was great! I love a loaded nacho and they were LOADED! I've had their elotes 2 different occasions and I can only say, only get it when its corn season, hahaha. The corn was great the first time, in season sweet corn. The 2nd time it just lacked sweetness and you can tell its not corn season, but that's not really their calling. We also tried one of their bowls, I don't remember exactly which one, but pretty good. We also had the churros and the Horchata. My boyfriend and I love their Horchata. The churros are pretty decent. Overall, i really like this spot."
16,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,12/9/2020,5 star rating,"I love ordering from Nacho Macho Taco because it is consistantly great!  The delivery is always quick.  My coworkers have started ordering from here as well because we know we are always going to get an amazing lunch.  The Al Pastor tacos are my favorite, the corn tortillas taste fresh, the pork is seasoned well and the portion is great.  The chips and guacamole are a great combo too.  The guacamole has a slight kick and is so creamy and delicious.  Lunch is a great value!"

I tried to give my tray to the girl behind the register but she kept reaching over the register to bag my items. How does that make sense?? She was also embroiled in an argument with her manager, another customer and another associate. They all kept saying we are out of green tea, we are out of green tea! (They can't brew more or...?) The poor lady was waiting for her green tea cake. Afterwards my girl was just speaking poorly under her breath about her manager for the remainder of my time there. I was also THE ONLY OTHER PERSON WAITING TO PAY. I hope they're just working out the kinks but that was a TERRIBLE experience."

I drink coffee everyday  so i know when my hazelnut latte is messed up i got vanilla instead I told him it's vanilla and he said that's what I ordered. The young lady came by and asked me what did I order and remade my drink for me she also gave me a large because of the trouble. She's the reason I'll be coming back, very sweet young lady need more like her in this service."
22,9dqJrTzx0GvBNb-J0VyeGg,6/18/2021,1 star rating,"Isn't this bakery supposed to be classy and clean? People bring their chick fil a and the employees don't say anything about it, allowing people to eat other place foods here. I'm actually in shock and this severely makes the brand look bad."
23,9dqJrTzx0GvBNb-J0VyeGg,12/2/2019,2 star rating,"I worked for 1y on this block without ever having noticed this location until today thus this location must be just a few months old.Their Union Square, 8th Ave, and Chinatown locations among others have all closed recently, the result of poorly executed aggressive expansion plans 2y ago. Pity but it's expected given my long-term disappointment by their cakes. From 6y to 3y ago, my family and I would for a nearly month pace of someone's birthday would get the blueberry yogurt cake ($36). It was a family favorite since it had rich cream, light blueberry taste, a difficult-to-control recipe, lovely consistency and texture, and overall stellar quality. A restaurant's ability to repeat a dish sets it apart from other providers. We noticed the rapid fall off of all those factors 3y ago and rapidly within 2 cake buys switched to the then rising and equally expanding Tous Les Jours. We've never looked back and after today's incident, am confident we made the correct choice. The total spend forfeitted is literally $100s, so Paris Baguette should take note of the scale of loss.Their other goods are none the better with many veering too close to the Chinese baked goods which so so many Chinatown bakers do better for literally 1/3 the price along with Bake Culture and a dozen competitive Korean bakers, big and small all. They also tried midtown Manhattan lunch goods but who'd pay $8-16 for a sandwich worth 1/4-1/2 that? They also flopped in the quality of service as staff clearly turned over quickly and now rarely have any Koreans which puts into question their adherance to their origins. The customers are few, especially noticably in a such copious empty space even in such a high foot traffic location. No throngs of regular Asian girls, an often reliable sign of food quality, confirm what all others (except those newbies led astray by some travel guide) feel.Paris Baguette tried some rewards program late last year which was namely my entering the receipt number into the app since the app never worked to auto-accept the register's purchase. I also remember 4y ago they gave a free annual print calendar which had 2 coupons monthly. Never used any of the 24+ coupons, even the free item ones, since they were either irrelevant (like some item which made no sense to their business model) or required such an unusually large purchase as would unlikely occur, say, $75 special cake order or $18 lunch item order. Neither mattered to save Paris Baguette's loyalty since they were both so poorly executed.This new location thusfar isn't reversing the service declines as surly distracted staff with dour or neutral attitudes lacking heart gives customers that same feeling in addition to food made without the necessary care for this tier of competition."
24,9dqJrTzx0GvBNb-J0VyeGg,2/24/2020,5 star rating,My favorite place to get a croissant and a hot chocolate. NOTE: they changed the chocolate they use so now it's a Belgium dark chocolate which is still great but you have to make sure that you ask them to put in the sweetener or else it is a hot bitter mess.
25,9dqJrTzx0GvBNb-J0VyeGg,12/11/2019,4 star rating,Came here to grab a cake. Pretty quick service although very small space for where it's located. Would recommend to stop by if you want any bakery items and/or drinks.
26,9dqJrTzx0GvBNb-J0VyeGg,1/29/2020,3 star rating,"I've been to several locations, so I feel like I can accurately compare and give a fair assessment. This Paris Baguette seems disorganized, with the staff a little clueless with what the store offers and a bit of an attitude.Being that it is a chain store, shouldn't they be offering the same things? A simple iced green tea shouldn't throw one off. I had to suggest that she charge it as a black iced tea and not a more expensive latte....just common sense. still, as mentioned in the beginning of this review, I go to Paris Baguette for a reason and it's for their bread/pastry products which were standard here."

I'd give a 5 start if it wasn't because right now this store doesn't have a lot options available like others but it definitely have a 5 starts in service. I just was there and Johnathan was really helpful and patient with me. I really love a good service that's what I just got! And now more than ever is really important and nice to see people who always give their best in difficult times like this!"

33,dNFsMw-z3Vsa5TbJd9Q4Ew,5/17/2022,4 star rating,"Went here before seeing a Sunday matinee at NYCC. Only party in attendance at around noon so we felt comfortable but it definitely started getting busier around 1:30. We've been here pre-pandemic and know it's a reliable spot for burgers, tacos, fries, and pretzel bites. Mini tacos were surprisingly filling. Waiter was attentive and polite, but not overly friendly. Note that sliders (mini burgers) don't come with fries and you have to order extra but it does come with a regular burger. The bathrooms in the basement were out of order while we were there so everyone from all parties were using the single person handicap stall on the main floor which created a line. Management was just like, ""yeah it's out,"" when another party asked if the bathrooms were open yet and it was a pretty casual response. Feel like other places would've at least apologized for the inconvenience."
34,dNFsMw-z3Vsa5TbJd9Q4Ew,2/3/2022,5 star rating,"Great food and atmosphere. We came on a Wednesday evening, it was def crowded by the bar area for times during COVID, which means it's good vibes! Although it's a lounge, we were able to sit as a family in the back and it was secluded and nice. The food was awesome. I'd say the chicken tacos are the best tacos I ever had and the buffalo wings. Family had burgers and California club and they loved it all. The staff was even great, amazing and friendly! Def recommend the food, staff and atmosphere and prices were awesome for Manhattan."

The atmosphere is cozy and laid back (though I was forced against my will to watch an entire episode of that show 911). The drinks were alright, my cosmo was a little watery but the house white was everything you'd want in a house white (a-ok and cheap). Would recommend if you need to be close to broadway for a show!"

41,M2AfRLalBLSoj8WBxCtbZw,10/19/2018,2 star rating,"I have to say, I received the rudest treatment by an employee when I was getting breakfast with my sister and son, yesterday on 10/18/18. The woman employee that was working there made us feel so uncomfortable, un-welcomed, and as if she was doing us a favor by taking our order. When I went to place my order, I ordered a chai tea latte, and she literally barked at me, telling that they don't have, ""chai tea lattes""..... it honestly was so sad to see someone so angry and miserable. She truly was so horrible, I can't believe the other male employee (who was so nice and made our burritos) did not interject and say something to her. I truly hope a manager sees this review and something is done."
42,M2AfRLalBLSoj8WBxCtbZw,7/1/2018,1 star rating,"Pretty terrible service and mediocre food. If you're gonna order a coffee, order across the street at Starbucks instead. I ordered a cafe au lait and it was about 5% coffee. The woman behind me seemed to have the same problem, but the guy who was serving her didn't seem to care when she asked twice for more coffee. She left with a coffee that looked close to the same shade as mine.The server's name was Michael.Would recommend literally anywhere else in nyc for coffee, they also REALLY skimped on the cream cheese with my bagel. I'm sure their muffins are fine though..."

The woman who runs things behind the counter is so unpleasant and rude to employees in front of us customers. I wish they'd get new management so that I could have good coffee and a nice experience. I can't wait for Hungry Ghost to open nearby so I can find a new coffee spot, hopefully with friendlier service."
44,M2AfRLalBLSoj8WBxCtbZw,8/5/2016,4 star rating,Solid coffee and Latte. I get the skim caramel latte and it is delicious but also unique . Not like a big chain macchiato or anything. Special flavor. Reviews about service are legit but I'm not a park slope bitch so won't drag on about it.

I'm visiting from out of town (CA) and stopped by to grab something quick. and healthy. I saw they had smoothies and ordered some for my husband and me. My fault for not ordering to the strengths of the location. Don't order unless you're looking for fruit juice blended with ice. Kind of a sugary mess. I also got the feeling that the woman behind the counter wasn't happy with me despite the fact that I was one of maybe 2 people there in the middle of the day on a Monday. So, not really sure what the deal is with the coffee or pastries but the smoothies and service are a no-go."
48,M2AfRLalBLSoj8WBxCtbZw,10/20/2019,5 star rating,I love this spot. Their pastries and muffins are excellent. Very sugary. They'll also make you pretty much any kind of bacon/egg/cheese/whatever you want.
49,M2AfRLalBLSoj8WBxCtbZw,11/22/2011,3 star rating,"Came in here because a friend wanted a (cup)cake.  She really wanted cake (I think all people generally do), but because I do not generally partake in the sweets she opted for the cuppy version instead.  It's sort of become my recent interest in getting to know what women want (out of a cupcake).  I've had standard answers such as the cake itself needs to be (super)moist, not too sweet, and one of my friends said she'd like an aftertaste (whatever that really means, I'm not too sure).Thinking back on the bite of her Red Velvet cupake I suppose it really was quite average.  I think she was somewhat dismayed about the fact that I told her it was simply food coloring and not some natural food ingredient mother nature intended.  I'll digress and comment on how love is just as artificial.  Bottom line, the cupcake tasted like something out of a wrapper bought from a convenience store."
50,ybQV8joopvU1_gG2RwLRog,7/5/2021,4 star rating,"Certainly the preparation has much improved since we were last here. The vegetables in each dish were very fresh and nothing was overcooked. Also, far less oil now used. We have problems with onions and our requests were honored. With the demise of other nearby Chinese American restaurants, it's reassuring to see this one persevere."
51,ybQV8joopvU1_gG2RwLRog,10/22/2020,1 star rating,"Be aware this is a cash only business.   I ordered food for delivery and, because I would have to pay in cash, I asked the price for my order. I was quoted $54 but, upon delivery, I was charged $64.  The receipt did not list prices for each item so I had no way to understand the discrepancy. The fellow making the delivery spoke little English so I did not long pursue an explanation.  Six dishes were""prepared"" and delivered 3 blocks away in 25 minutes; that was impressive. The food itself was adequate, just, and lacked any sense of care or pride in preparation and packaging. The egg roll and spring roll were mostly shredded cabbage - but not greasy.  Spare ribs were surprisingly good, not over sweet, not fatty and with plenty of meat. Moo shu pancakes, rectangular, did not hold up well in use.  Portions are generous.  This place likely does a great deal of business with the many student populations in the surrounding area - large amounts of filling ""stuff"". Included with my delivery (but not in my order) were two cans of Pepsi; perhaps they cost the additional $10."
52,ybQV8joopvU1_gG2RwLRog,3/8/2019,4 star rating,I think they have decent food and decent prices. It's usually very busy during popular lunch hours. Sometimes I call ahead so that I don't have to wait inside the crowded restaurant---because I will leave smelling like grease. I haven't had any issues with the customer service. It's one of my go to Chinese restaurants in this neighborhood.

55,ybQV8joopvU1_gG2RwLRog,1/28/2020,3 star rating,I mean...in a pinch maybe it's ok? I came here during rush hour dinner time and it took nearly 20 minutes for an appetizer order of steamed veggie dumplings to be made. After all that waiting I expected them to be amazing but they were just meh. Next time I'll call ahead and just pick up. They're not the worst but certainly not the best dumplings to write home about. Decent price for the area- 5.50 for 6 huge dumplings. Service was super friendly. Place was packed so maybe I'll give it another chance- people clearly love it.

This place is disgusting DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE DONT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT MAGGOTS IN YOUR TAKEOUT. Also to make it even better the delivery guy came back to give us our money back and we showed him the maggot, he TOUCHED THE MAGGOT gave us the money and ran out."

58,ybQV8joopvU1_gG2RwLRog,9/8/2015,5 star rating,"Used to order from Ollie's when it was on Broadway (used to actually be good years ago), but it went downhill and it closed, and Hiro Sushi at Ollie's by Riverside is shit, so I've switched to a few other Chinese joints, namely, Wok City. Oh the wasted years! Food is not only cheaper, but better. And the people are friendlier and seem to actually care about the customer.I love their tofu dishes. The tofu is big and lightly fried (not like the tofu at Empire Szechuan which are little cubes of over-fried soy shit-curds) so the outside is just crispy enough while still being squishy and decadently delicious. They have sesame tofu, but you can ask for, say, General Tso's and orange tofu ('cause it's just the same dish with a different corn syrupy sauce, right?)  Honestly I'd probably be happy to have the General Tso's tofu as my last meal. Also strongly recommend the eggplant with garlic sauce.As another reviewer mentioned, I do applaud them for having some ""American"" dishes as well (e.g., fried chicken, french fries, etc.) They know their customers! (the students of MLK High School and the residents of the nearby projects buildings).This is not a place where you should eat if you want to eat healthy, however, if you want to treat yourself/are stoned and want to munch on some delicious food, and for it to also be cheap 'cause you've already spent a lot of money on pot, then Wok City is the ticket!!! Love you, Wok City!"

The staff are not super friendly but they are not rude.  This was my experience yesterday.  For some reason I had a long wait for my order. The 2 people who came in after me got their food before me. I was anxious since i had to be somewhere and I only had 30 minutes to eat. The wings were great. The pork fried rice was mostly rice and was lacking in pork. Side story.  This African American man came in while I was waiting and placed an order. I heard him asked for his wings to be well done and chopped up.  The woman behind the counter repeated repeated his order and then told him they don't chop up wings. The man asked again twice and each time the woman nonchalant just told him they don't do that. He paid and went outside. Later his wife came in and said ""u know what turbulent means?"" In a very accusatory tone. No one (staff and customers) said anything since we had no clue where that came from mom did we know she was the wife of the man. Just like her husband, she kept repeating herself.  When she did not get the reaction she wanted, she went in and said ""it means rude!  You were rude to my husband.""  Still no one said anything since we have no idea what she was talking about. Her husband came back inside and asked her what was happening.  She then said it was the second time this happened and she would never come back. She wanted her money back.  The staff gave her the money she requested. As they were walking out, the husband asked if she had counted the money.  If I was her, i would have asked my husband how much he paid and then count the money. Instead she just went back to the counter, laid out the money on the table and said ""$7.50. Oh and ""WE"" people cannot count, right?""  She said that twice.  Mind you thus far no one EXCEPT HER and her husband had said anything. After their departure, staff and customers looked at each other. We were still speechless. I told the staff not to worry about it. That woman clearly have issues.  She was trying to pick a fight. I can't help but feel this couple was just asking for trouble.  You don't walk into MCDonalds and ask for kosher food and call the staff rude if they tell you they don't serve kosher. The staff here were not agitated or disturbed. That is what turbulent REALLY means. She should check the dictionary before trying to bully people. Staff here are not all smiles or warm and fuzzy. But they are not rude.  They didn't even talk back to this woman who was ranting and trying to start a figh"

Thats a full charge of $8 every time.  Seriously?  Who does that?  $56 for Diet Coke?  This practice is criminal.Highlight of night is that fire alarm was pulled during meal.  Was going off for 10 minutes and nobody moved...for the hassle we got some dessert wine but overall I'd not return here even if someone else paying.  $700+ out the door for 4 people and still hungry and annoyed after a subpar experience.  If you have other options for higher end Chinese food, take them."

I think the portions were small for the price, but not unreasonable. The service was alright but unimpressive. If you're wondering what to get, I recommend the duck and the crab."

To be fair we only visited this place for drinks and appetizers so my review is limited to that.None of their cocktails caught my fancy so the bar tender made me my favorite mezcal cocktail.The rim had Sichuan pepper seasoning and I practically lost sense in my tastebud so be careful of that. Loved the drink though, didn't know mezcal and passion fruit makes a great pair.We ordered lobster dumplings as appetizers. $22 for three pieces is pretty steep but the dumplings are of superior quality, melt in the mouth texture and delicious. I wish we could have stayed longer but then we had dinner reservations elsewhere. This place is so eye catching that it definitely deserves a revisit."

Our reservation was for 6:30pm and there was a good amount of people already having dinner. Around 7:45pm the lights dimmed and there is soft music playing in the background, a good mix of tunes. For food, we had the spring rolls, half Peking Duck, Dan Dan noodles, and waygu dumplings. 10/10 across the board. Everything was flavorful and fresh. We all shared the dishes and it was more than enough! So so good. Terence was an attentive and amazing server, very polite and friendly. Would highly recommend coming to anyone in the area."

We both enjoyed the Comfortably Numb, which had cool presentation with a chili pepper balancing on the edge of the coupe. Just maybe do not try to drink that part! There were some spotty elements to the service. For example, no one wiping our table for a while when we were between courses (and had a crumb situation going on) and seeing the next table over getting bumped into a couple of times by staff. However, everything tasted good. The Dim Sum dumpling platter was enjoyable, pretty, and perfect to share. We also really liked the veggie fried rice. However, the traditional duck was a bit fatty, and the second course of the duck was a bit of an odd presentation. (Personally, I feel that Redfarm's duck is better.) The room itself is beautiful with soaring, high ceilings. A mostly nice experience, but with a few things that did not quite feel like fine dining to merit the price tag."
66,qrncvjkiKN5Z-JC06ygy6A,10/6/2022,2 star rating,Food was all mediocre. Only two that stood out were the dimsum platter and the wagyu beef dumpling. Also really overpriced for what it is.

I sat at the bar and the restaurant was quite empty on this Tuesday evening. Nevertheless I enjoyed the ambiance and charm this place has! I wasnt very hungry so I ordered a drink. I had asked the bartender to surprise me - he killed it i loved my sweet drink- staff knows their alcohol!!For food I ordered the squid ink dumplings and loved the presentation- very simple yet delicate I didn't want to eat them. The dumplings came out hot and were full of flavor - almost like a soup dumpling! The squid ink really added a kick of juiciness that i enjoyed. I must come back to further explore their menu on an empty stomach!
68,qrncvjkiKN5Z-JC06ygy6A,1/6/2023,3 star rating,"The first time I visited Hutong was in 2019, and I had a positive experience overall. I recall the dishes being well executed, and although the restaurant is definitely on the pricey side, the food and service were good. I revisited the restaurant several weeks ago with family members from out of town who wanted to try the flaming Peking duck. This time around, I felt that the quality and portion size of the dishes did not justify the exorbitant prices. Granted, I live in Queens now and have access to exceptionally delicious yet affordable Chinese food, so my standards have changed a bit, but regardless, I wasn't all that impressed with Hutong. The flaming duck was definitely tasty, but flaming it table side seemed more gimmicky than anything else, and I'm not sure it actually added much to how the duck had already been prepared. Additionally, they only carve and plate the breast meat, then take the rest of the duck back to the kitchen to be deboned and sautéed with green beans, but what actually comes back is a tiny bowl that's mostly filled with green beans and almost no meat (certainly not the amount of meat that gets taken back to the kitchen). We had other dishes too: dumplings, prawn rolls, wagyu millefeuille, chef's rice, beef tenderloin, sea bass, and spiced chicken. None of these other dishes were memorable, and the actual amount of protein in the sea bass, tenderloin, and sea bass dishes was minuscule. The prawn rolls and wagyu millefeuille were okay among the appetizers, but the pork dumplings had an oddly sweet wrapper and a slight after taste that I found off putting. The service was spotty at times but our main server was very nice. Drinks were expensive but on par for the neighborhood ($26 for a martini). In short, I think this would be a fun experience for out-of-town tourists who may be impressed by ""elevated"" Chinese food or may not have access to it, but I don't think it's necessarily worth it for anyone who lives in NYC."
69,qrncvjkiKN5Z-JC06ygy6A,1/9/2022,3 star rating,"I found Hutong on Instagram and the pictures looked amazing. The restaurant itself is in the Bloomberg building. I went with my family on a cold week night for early dinner and we were the first diners in the restaurant. The decor is elegantly modern and the tables are well spaced out from each other. About and hour into our meal the dining room did full up a considerable amount and by the time we left it was a full house. I was excited for the dim sum that was beautiful on Instagram but it was quite average. I had to re read the menu to know what I was supposed to be eating because the flavors of the set kind of blended together. The hot and sour soup dumplings were interesting but I'm a sucker for original pork soup dumplings. They do have great flavor for their chili dishes. Their calamari flowers were good. No matter where I go I always get kou shui chicken and it was surprisingly good and I wanted a second portion.The highlight of the meal was definitely the red lantern soft shelled crab and the bao dessert. The crab was delicious but was a smaller portion than I expected for the price. I really enjoyed the cuteness of the bao dessert. It was light and not super sweet. A perfect end to the meal. Overall I think it's a great Instagram-able place to go, decent flavors, but not quite worth the price range. I would still prefer the flavors of a good hole-in-the-wall in flushing or Chinatown. That being said, I did miss out on some dishes like the wagyu beef millefeuille that I would be willing to go back to try. Maybe not as a whole meal but for drinks and decently the bao dessert."

Yep, you might have to wait like 10-15 min to get a slice but it's worth it since they make it super fresh and man in the cold, this pizza slapped HARD. I wanted to try the cheese but the margherita was fresh out of the oven and I got the first slice. so GOOD. It might have been the vibes and my craving for an NY slice, but thin crust is always the way to go. They also have square pies and gluten free if that's more your style."

We were hoping that by drinking margaritas, we would not realize how bad the food was, but unfortunately the margs were as bad as the food.

There's also a patron HH which is every day from pm-7pm  . Bouncer at the door   . Except the crowd to get loud on Friday and Saturday nights so be prepared to yell to your friends.  . Limited space and tight so except to be seated close to others The food is decent but a bit pricey for the quality.  If not ordering from one from their drinks specials I just don't feel the drinks are worth the price being that they are never strong enough in my opinion (unless you're a lightweight) but the flavors are good and they do have a very wide variety to choose from.  The service can be hit or miss.  When being seated I've had nothing but good experiences with the servers but when seated at the bar, it took a while for the bartender to even acknowledge my presence.    If you're in the area and can catch the special then I would recommend giving this place a shot but there's honestly better options in the neighborhood."

Both were around $10-$20. You are not able to do a variety of different meats for the tacos so that sucks.I always get worried ordering tacos as I have had my bad experiences but I am proud to say this place is safe! The tortilla was not grainy and the steak was chewy and tasted amazing with the lime.The quesadilla was also delicious! They came piping hot! The chicken was surprisingly chewy and did not have the usual dry texture. Their drinks were just as good as their food! The drink menu is quite extensive, hence slightly overwhelming to look at with all the unique concoctions they have. I shared a Frozen Margarita, which came in a large glass. Definitely refreshing! I highly recommend squeezing the limes in to make it taste like Sprite.Chill wonderful place! I can see myself going back here again. If I have money."

The drink menu was very fun and I had a hard time choosing what drink to go with. I settled for the Rainbow Margarita which was large and flavorful. We weren't provided with the brunch menu, but I liked the choices on the regular menu. We started with nachos w/ chicken as an appetizer. We devoured them immediately. Super delicious, but could've been a more generous portion of chips as we were left with more toppings at the end. I had the cilantro skirt steak tacos for my meal which were accompanied by rice and beans. Everything was very well flavored and great tasting. We ordered a side of fries too which we're fresh out of the fryer. For dessert we had churros and the tres leches cake. Both of which were the perfect end to our meal.

And I do not want to hear the, ""this is the Upper West Side"" nonsense, because that is nonsense.They open early, great, thank you very much, but after that, what is there to really like? The proximity to the 1 train?First off, this feels more like a convenience store than a bagelry. Putting laundry detergent with fresh bagels do not mix.Then there is everything else. Everything tastes the same. Very little to no taste in everything.The yogurt parfait I had tastes so watered down, that the despite the fresh fruit and the granola, makes it feel like I ate this right out of a supermarket dairy section.The oatmeal chocolate chip cookie is one that tastes right out of a box. The oatmeal is there, but I barely taste much else. I like that it is big, but a lot of meh. That I do not like.Now, your feature presentation, the plain bagel with cream cheese and lox. The bagel presents well, a crunchy exterior with a chewy interior, but after that, just angers me to my core. The cream cheese is soft, warm, and creates a huge mess after taking a bite. The bagel has zero taste, just crunch and chew, but there is nothing that makes me want to get this bagel again. It has zero personality, a blandness that makes my blood boil to the point that I have to stop writing before I pop a blood vessel or give myself an ulcer.In case you have not caught on, this bagelry gets a thumbs down from me."

I had to write it a review because I seriously had no idea a baguette could be so ... incredible? Specifically the baguette on the Frenchie sandwich. (Not sure if its on others too. I need to try the rest of the new options out.)Great coffee as well. Like I said, Early has always been a fav, but... try this baguette. It's an experience. Perfectly soft inside with perfect amount of crunch to the crust and ... the flakiness... the incredible flakiness... A god made this bread, but apparently it's from a local baker.*I am told the change is not so recent, but I was gone from the city for a while due to our gracious pandemic."

The music choice was very good. Added to the nice decor and ambiance.I had the crispy duck in garlic sauce. It was good .

I found it weird with the first one but brushed it off as I was eating a whole lot of batter, But upon further chewing and taking the food out of my mouth . There it was chewed up and whole pieces of plastic. Needless to say I lost my appetite . I called to make them aware that's when the order of attitude came..

Food here definitely depends on day of the week. Ordered the giant shrimp sticks on Friday night and it was prepared differently today than last time, but very good both times. Pad see ew is hit or miss, today had a good mix of vegetables including snow peas and baby corn which I liked. Pleasantly surprised by fried coconut ice cream - not to be missed!

Asicsly inlove everything although the summer rolls are a bit big in that NYC way that I'm always grumbly about - they should be more bite sized in my view and with more variety inside but again they're still good just not my preference.

We eventually settled fried duck fried rice and he had the Clearwater soup with chicken delicious delicious delicious delicious.  Food came out extremely quick I would say we didn't wait more than 15 minutes.  When it came out it was piping hot, it was fresh it was so good.  All throughout our dining experience we had servers  asking us are you OK do you need anything else.  The bill came out and in total it was only $20 that is super cheap and for the portion we got, for the service that we received ,I would definitely recommend the spot.   My son is a teenager and it was appropriate for his age"

The gyro is good but not great with the shredded lamb. Aside from that, my biggest complaint is about one of the employees. A guy went in and stood there on the phone, coughing, AND NOT WEARING A MASK. NONE of the employees said anything. I thought they were supposed to enforce this. No mask no service?Anyway, the a hole of a guy who wasn't wearing a mask asked one of the employees to take a phone order from his cellphone. At first the employee hesitated but then took the call. (Took the cellphone in his hand) and with that same hand that he used the phone, he went on to serving the guy. No gloves. With that same bare hand he grabbed my pita bread from the oven.Normally I wouldn't give a s--- if employees weren't wearing gloves to serve. I'm sure they wash their hands. But to grab some random persons phone and serve him and everyone else with that same hand especially when he was coughing and not wearing a mask???? Yuk...  If I catch this virus, now I'll know from where."

167,y9GhIt1MLh6344ODA65NQw,7/27/2020,2 star rating,"I've ordered from here no less than 3 times and each time I have come away less and less impressed. The 1st time, I ordered via the Yelp app, I was upcharged about 20-25% more to have NONE of my food ready when promised. When I walked in at the appointed time, to pick up my order, they asked me what I had ordered and they said ""ok, let me make that for you"". Why did I even call ahead AND pay MORE to have to wait in line like everyone else and have my food prepared only when I got there?That being said, my family and I did enjoy the food. Flavors were good but beware their hot sauce lacks kick - it's tangier than anything else and not very fiery. The white sauce is pretty good though. We ordered platters without salad and subbed in fries. The fries tasted good but were super soggy by the time I got home (in under 10 mins). Perhaps putting them into containers with a little venting would be practical. Also ordered a couple of falalel balls to try out and I had the same impression - good flavor but got soggy during transport.The 2nd and 3rd times (keep in mind all 3 times were within about a month and a half), I was underwhelmed by the quantity of food we got. On the last visit, I noticed how stingy the server was when packing rice into our platters. Whereas most halal places/carts pack in the rice and layer the meats on top, the guy who was serving us was shaking the rice in ever so carefully. How much does rice cost these days? It's like I was asking for freshly shaved truffle that is super expensive. This is just rice! The meat, too, was not very generously given (I usually get the chicken & lamb combo). I don't know if they realize how much halal food competition there is in the area but if they want to retain their customers, they need to step it up in this area as there are many other places (especially carts) which give you a bigger bang for your buck. When it comes to halal food, the value you get goes a long way IMHO.Lastly, I find this place to be inefficient when they usually have 3-4 guys on staff. One guy stands at the register and all he needs to do is bag the food and ring up customers. The other 2-3 are free to work the grill and assemble orders on the line. Whenever I have been here, there is never a huge line inside, yet everything takes more time than it should. And, yes, I am factoring in call-ahead orders they have to prep for pick up. Perhaps if they spent less time hyper-analyzing how much rice and chicken to put into each platter and were more generous with filling things up, things would go quicker. I'm not trying to be snarky because I really do want to like the overall experience enough to return, but I may need to take a hiatus and see if they step up their game by the time I return.I'm docking a couple of stars for service/wait and value. Otherwise, would be closer to 3.5 to 4 stars. The venue is generally clean, spacious, and attractive so kudos for that. Parking is not always easily found due to the location and number of neighboring businesses."

I normally get just the chicken and rice. The white sauce and hot sauce they have is very good. I only wish they had the orange rice they use to offer instead of the brown rice type they offer now. Nice and friendly staff. Quick service and fair price. I come here often.

The employees are usually pretty nice and they get you out quickly.  It's a good choice for lunch if you want a chain sub, but if you want a deli sub Andy's around the corner is great."

Hits the spot! However, on a most recent visit, I'm not going back to this location, mostly because of the lack of action from management that I've seen. I had just sat down and settled in to eating my sandwich, when all of a sudden, a guy appears and sets down his binder and sits down next to me and on the other side, another customer eating his sandwich, and caused me to be a little startled with how abrupt and loud his actions were. Then I realized, he's one of the employees here, and most likely part of the management. Well, whatever. He can sit where he likes, even though there were plenty of other places to sit at. As I'm halfway done with my sandwich, two girls come in, and they were definitely looking for trouble. I hear a little ruckus by the registers and then they get loud and leave, after most likely throwing some napkins (I didn't see it from where I was sitting) and then here's where it gets gross. The first girl decides to spray-spit on the door, and then goes outside laughing, where she spits again. Gross!!! Then the manager next to me, gets up and goes to talk with his employees and asks anyone if they got affected or what not from the two troublemakers. And then, the part that made me not want to come back here. He did NOTHING to clean up the spit on the door or the window. Really?!??!! He even went outside and stood outside looking at something, but had no mind to assign someone to clean the door/window up or anything!!!! Officially grossed out now. I was almost done with my sandwich at that point, so I just tossed out my stuff and left, but wow. If they don't clean up something that obvious, what does that say about their food prep area???? No thank you!"

This was not in the plans... nor did I know of any lunch places in the area.   However, I had heard of POTBELLY NYC, 17TH & BROADWAY. And so, from California to NYC I started calling.  Long story short, while calling in desperation, with only a fifteen window (15) window of time, I was greeted with CHARNELLE THOMPSON's kind voice from POTBELLY NYC, 17TH & BROADWAY who immediately calmed me by jumping into action and taking the lead.  She thought of everything, and asked all the right questions, I've never had anyone think for me before .... Hearing my desperation, she said, ""Michelle, I've got this, don't worry about a thing I've got your back"".  She proceeded to take my order, provide me with options and provided me with suggestions to fit the audience of guests.  She provided a meal for a large group of overseas travelers.  Making me, which made my boss look good. It does take a village, it took Charnelle to jump into action, it took the kitchen to prepare the meal on such short notice, and it took the caterers to deliver and set up.  BUT, it all started at the door, when Charnelle answered the phone, had it not started with her calming voice and kind words, what could have been a disaster ended up being a successful business lunch that everyone benefited from.   I cannot speak more highly of POTBELLY NYC, 17TH & BROADWAY, and the entire team there.  If you ever need a meal in a pinch, please go or call this place, they will NOT disappoint."

There's a TV hanging above the counter, playing a movie. It's a small restaurant, like a deli, with a extensive menu of Dominican food. Hot food is kept behind counter and ready to be served by the 2 waitresses. Sandwiches are made using crispy warm bagguettes. We ordered pernil with tostones and cheese mofongo. Pernil, the roasted pork, are full of flavors and moist. Excelente. Tostones, fried green plantains, were served with meat sauce over top. Cheese mofongo are made with smashed green plantains and garlic and served with meat sauce over top and a side salad of lettuce and tomato. This mofongo is dry and plain, so we had to ask for extra meat sauce to flavor it up. I do not recommend it. Dominican food is sure heavy though with much starch.

But on second thought, it's really about the simple, delicious ""comida Dominicana."" I popped in for dinner recently and grabbed one of the four stools at the counter. The All-Star Game was playing on the flat screen, which is about half the size of this tiny joint. Not quite sure what to order, I opted for the chicken with rice and beans, and was presented with a heaping plate with two pieces of pollo guisado, along with arroz y frijoles. The food wasn't spectacular but it did taste like someone cooked it in their home. Just like Momma used to make, ya know what I mean. This is also the kind of place where you can practice your Spanish. I struck up a conversation with the Uruguayan dude sitting next to me. I told him I thought the empanadas here were pretty good. Mr Uruguay shook his head. ""No,"" he said, speaking as someone born in a country where empanadas are a birthright, like pizza in New York. ""You must try the pernil. Here take a bite of mine.""I respectfully declined but damn if that pernil -- which was pulled from a pork butt displayed in a pan right inside the window -- didn't look amazing.  I wanted to take that bite, but I held back. (It's worth noting that Mr Uruguay's wife was highly annoying -- Don't grab my book without asking biach -- Who lives in NY and marries a South American and can't speak a word in Spanish? WTF is that all about?)Best of all? My tab for chicken, rice, beans AND a Presidente was only $8.50. I'll be back for some of that Pernil."

Always solid and a great neighborhood Thai joint.  If you're looking for fair pricing, quality and consistency, this Thai joint is your place.  Don't expect to be wowed to the moon by the food, but it's consistently solid and won't break the bank, which works for me when I'm ordering take out."

The gf and I got two cemitas con bistec, an agua jamaica, and a squirt. The food arrived in a reasonable time frame but also arrived cold. Reheating wasn't a big deal but then...oh no.Our cemitas were almost inedible. Dry, anemic pieces of chewy steak. No avocado. Huge chunks of queso oaxaca that tasted like regular deli aisle string cheese. Way too many beans and an almost ridiculous number of whole chipotles. The chipotles made the whole sandwich overly smoky, oily, and soggy (the heavy shmear of beans made that worse too). We were a bit under the influence and still could not enjoy these sad cemitas.They also forgot the squirt.

This is an early breakfast place for those early birds. The coffee is excellent, and the breakfast menu is incredible! There's a lot to choose from. I had bagel and lox to go a few times before, and I must say that capers and onions they include in a bagel make this the best bagel I've ever had in NY. The onion is not raw but pickled onion. This time I came for breakfast, and I had avocado toast. I loved my avocado toast! They served this with a side of nice house salad on a wooden plate. I liked the dish! Pier 1? Amazon? The avocado was fresh, topped with a good egg on a piece of excellent multigrain bread. Perfect! I do this at home too. So, if you see me not yelping, I may be making some fantastic dishes at home or making calls to restaurants (what's the special tonight's?) If you feel like having an excellent breakfast, please don't be shy to stop by! Outside seating feels like sitting at a garden cafe in Italy or Greece or something. Excellent service and breakfast! Thank you!"

I arrived to pick up my order and the man at the counter said 10 mins. It looks like they have not even started working on my order. A customer behind me ordered on the spot and got his food around 1:05PM. At 1:10PM, I came up to the counter to follow up on my order, and I tried to get the man's attention but he literally walked right past me and just ignored me completely. So I told the woman behind the counter, that ""I'm picking up my order"" and I tried showing her name on my phone, and she said ""next time try to be nice"" LOL. I didn't even raise my voice or anything, so I was just so confused then left the restaurant since my order was not even being worked on. I cancelled the order via app. Worst experience."

I ordered the chakra bagel and ocean bagel after 30mins of waiting went to the desk to ask where my order was. After a few more minutes of waiting we got the wrong order. I was really hungry so just ate what they gave us. This is not the first time this happens, I'm writing this review on hope that they fix the problem and come up with a number system to keep track of the orders."

The service was good enough given how hectic it was inside, but the food was only ok. We had the french toast with berries, avocado toast, and the peanut butter smoothie. None of it was much to write home about. The avocado toast felt like someone just sliced an avocado and put it on bread... Something I could do better at home. The french toast was pretty good but nothing special. The PB smoothie was pretty boring, didn't have enough Pb and the chocolate in it just made me feel like I was drinking cocoa powder."

223,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,3/26/2015,3 star rating,"As Starbuckses go, this is a pretty good one. The staff is friendly and knows me and my ""usual"" order. Never had a serious problem with them. But here are my grievances nonetheless:1) the way the place is laid out, it's hard for the staff to see certain corners of the store. This leads bums to occasionally hang out in such corners. They're like the ""guards"" from Legends of the Hidden Temple. You're going around the corner thinking everything's good, then BOOM all the seats are taken up by a guy with a bunch of garbage bags muttering to himself. 2) The manager insists on making employees follow what I assume is in the corporate manual when they announce your drink is ready, and makes them act really excited about it and like they had an awesome time making it. Like ""Carolllllllllll I have your unsweetened iced coffeeeeeeeeee!"" Don't give me artificial emotions when all you really want to do is take my money and move on to the next guy. This isn't a strip club and even if it was, I'm not stupid enough to think that ""that one really liked me, no, seriously, I could tell.""3) They need to work on their unwarmed pastry delivery procedure. I would say that 1 in 5 times I order an unwarmed cookie, they forget about it and I have to ask. Or they mistake the cashier writing ""CHCC"" for chocolate croissant instead of a cookie and I have to correct them. Or they just grab a bunch of orders all at once and bring it to the warmer thing and I have to cut them off before they make it all gross and melty which is why I don't get it warmed. 4) they have one of those tables with a bunch of wooden chairs. Those things are ready to fall apart. The screws are loose and you can feel the parts of the chair sliding away from each other. Makes you scared to move, which leads you to stay in uncomfortable positions. Not to mention that eventually some old lady is going to break the chair, and her hips, and sue the fuck out of them and call everybody in the damn store as a witness. Carolllllllllll, I have your subpoenaaaaaa....."

The team at this specific location are friendly, know most of their customers by name, put care into making each beverage, and go above and beyond to make your Starbucks visit great.  Seeing the bright faces of the team helps me to get my day started.  Marissa (who definitely deserves to be a manager), Nic, Marvin, Arelis, Jamie, and Cass are all so pleasant; it doesn't matter if it's 530 AM or 530 PM all of them brighten my day with a smile, a joke, or just good conversation.  I absolutely love this Starbucks team, if there were ever an Undercover Boss episode done for Starbucks, it should definitely be at this location.(Sorry, I can't recall everyone's name because all the staff here are wonderful)"

244,MPV-rSjFjfxJDjOV97NwUw,1/24/2018,3 star rating,"I   frequent this Starbucks and it's decent. It honestly depends who you have making your coffee because when you ask for a splash of milk it will either be an actual splash or 1/4 of your coffee cup, which can be frustrating. It is right near the Medical Center so it can be fairly busy during the early morning hours, however the line moves quickly for the most part. I   definitely would not come here to study, sprawl out my books and get work done. It isn't a cozy warm Starbucks, it's a get in and get out. Sure they have tables and areas to sit but people are constantly standing right in front of you while they wait on line for their coffee, it isn't really a conducive environment to getting work done in my opinion. They have your standard Starbucks food and drink, if they don't have bananas out, ask because likely they just haven't been put out yet for the day. They have a code on the bathroom, which you would think is a good thing because it keeps people who are not customers out, however the code is long, I   can never remember it and it still isn't the cleanest bathroom in the world. Overall, a decent place to stop to get in and get out, just reiterate what a splash of milk is if you only want a splash."
245,MPV-rSjFjfxJDjOV97NwUw,5/29/2017,3 star rating,Great location.  Perfect for picking up on the run cause it right off the bus stop or on the way to the train. The seating is different from majority of the location but I like it cause the seats have a lot of space and you are facing away from the streets so you are free from distractions.   The service is fast and as usual and they will make them with 100% satisfaction so that is why I am a return customer.

248,MPV-rSjFjfxJDjOV97NwUw,6/3/2017,3 star rating,"Overall, average Starbucks. Coffee and food items are similar to other Starbucks in the city. And as a plus, this location is less crowded than average, and has large windows which give great lighting. It is also very clean. I am not sure if this is a change in corporate policy, but this Starbucks plays loud and clubby music - hip hop, R&B, house. As someone that loves to work and study in coffee shops, I find this disruptive. Starbucks used to play the soothing and relaxing coffee shop music, but this is not the case anymore. When I asked them nicely about music they said ""as long as there are no curse words, what's the problem"" despite the music being so loud and annoying as to disrupt me (and I'm sure many others on their laptops or reading a book). Perhaps this is the intention, to increase turnover, but it definitely makes it less pleasant to work here."

The place is very clean and a lot of people like to hang out on their laptops and just kick it so it gets crowded. The staff is very friendly and the get it done.

274,MPV-rSjFjfxJDjOV97NwUw,1/24/2018,3 star rating,"I   frequent this Starbucks and it's decent. It honestly depends who you have making your coffee because when you ask for a splash of milk it will either be an actual splash or 1/4 of your coffee cup, which can be frustrating. It is right near the Medical Center so it can be fairly busy during the early morning hours, however the line moves quickly for the most part. I   definitely would not come here to study, sprawl out my books and get work done. It isn't a cozy warm Starbucks, it's a get in and get out. Sure they have tables and areas to sit but people are constantly standing right in front of you while they wait on line for their coffee, it isn't really a conducive environment to getting work done in my opinion. They have your standard Starbucks food and drink, if they don't have bananas out, ask because likely they just haven't been put out yet for the day. They have a code on the bathroom, which you would think is a good thing because it keeps people who are not customers out, however the code is long, I   can never remember it and it still isn't the cleanest bathroom in the world. Overall, a decent place to stop to get in and get out, just reiterate what a splash of milk is if you only want a splash."
275,MPV-rSjFjfxJDjOV97NwUw,5/29/2017,3 star rating,Great location.  Perfect for picking up on the run cause it right off the bus stop or on the way to the train. The seating is different from majority of the location but I like it cause the seats have a lot of space and you are facing away from the streets so you are free from distractions.   The service is fast and as usual and they will make them with 100% satisfaction so that is why I am a return customer.

278,MPV-rSjFjfxJDjOV97NwUw,6/3/2017,3 star rating,"Overall, average Starbucks. Coffee and food items are similar to other Starbucks in the city. And as a plus, this location is less crowded than average, and has large windows which give great lighting. It is also very clean. I am not sure if this is a change in corporate policy, but this Starbucks plays loud and clubby music - hip hop, R&B, house. As someone that loves to work and study in coffee shops, I find this disruptive. Starbucks used to play the soothing and relaxing coffee shop music, but this is not the case anymore. When I asked them nicely about music they said ""as long as there are no curse words, what's the problem"" despite the music being so loud and annoying as to disrupt me (and I'm sure many others on their laptops or reading a book). Perhaps this is the intention, to increase turnover, but it definitely makes it less pleasant to work here."

Unfortunately, ive been coming here the past 3 weeks, but will be utilizing other nearby coffee shops or the other starbucks on park.They have roughly 8 people working and they are Sooooo slooowwww!!!!!!! We waited 15 min for oatmeal one time and then they forgot items.The self serve stations almost always has empty milk pourers, out of the hot beverage holsters ..you betcha.You just order a coffee? expect to wait as well, even for black.This location really needs more efficiency in assembly!"

I genuinely don't understand how I always end up waiting at least 15-20 minutes for an iced coffee, even if there are only a few people in front of me. Baristas are friendly enough, but preparing drinks at a snail's pace in a busy office building doesn't cut it.Wifi is also spotty, so don't come here with work if you absolutely need internet."

283,8iWto1WAB0eO91Kp-CYu1g,3/26/2015,3 star rating,"As Starbuckses go, this is a pretty good one. The staff is friendly and knows me and my ""usual"" order. Never had a serious problem with them. But here are my grievances nonetheless:1) the way the place is laid out, it's hard for the staff to see certain corners of the store. This leads bums to occasionally hang out in such corners. They're like the ""guards"" from Legends of the Hidden Temple. You're going around the corner thinking everything's good, then BOOM all the seats are taken up by a guy with a bunch of garbage bags muttering to himself. 2) The manager insists on making employees follow what I assume is in the corporate manual when they announce your drink is ready, and makes them act really excited about it and like they had an awesome time making it. Like ""Carolllllllllll I have your unsweetened iced coffeeeeeeeeee!"" Don't give me artificial emotions when all you really want to do is take my money and move on to the next guy. This isn't a strip club and even if it was, I'm not stupid enough to think that ""that one really liked me, no, seriously, I could tell.""3) They need to work on their unwarmed pastry delivery procedure. I would say that 1 in 5 times I order an unwarmed cookie, they forget about it and I have to ask. Or they mistake the cashier writing ""CHCC"" for chocolate croissant instead of a cookie and I have to correct them. Or they just grab a bunch of orders all at once and bring it to the warmer thing and I have to cut them off before they make it all gross and melty which is why I don't get it warmed. 4) they have one of those tables with a bunch of wooden chairs. Those things are ready to fall apart. The screws are loose and you can feel the parts of the chair sliding away from each other. Makes you scared to move, which leads you to stay in uncomfortable positions. Not to mention that eventually some old lady is going to break the chair, and her hips, and sue the fuck out of them and call everybody in the damn store as a witness. Carolllllllllll, I have your subpoenaaaaaa....."

Anyhoo, I like bold coffee.  I used to drink it daily and loved it. Then something changed.  The coffee I loved didn't taste the same anymore.  Same roast, same way I prep it. It just isn't as good, to me.  I just get a drip coffee, nothing special. If you are a specialty coffee drinker this review may not apply."

The best! The fried chicken and white rice excellent! The escovich snapper huge and delicious! The macaroni pies so comforting and the jerk pork with beans and rice exceptional! The chicken patty and coco bread delicious! The chocolate and red velvet cake to end my delicious family meal so so good! I am extremely satisfied and for the small portion size I ordered it was pretty large! I gave 5 stars because this place delivers with a smile and food is perfect!

315,69X4XVef3NRV_LlIvEuXug,11/26/2018,1 star rating,One day I was very hungry and the place I usually ordered from was closed. So I decided to try t&g flavors since they were open. I always passed by it and there are always people in it so I assumed the food would be good. I placed my order through uber eats and I received my food in a decent amount of time. I ordered a small curry goat with white rice and a side of Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was a good amount and was not bad taste wise but the curry goat...ha. There was more rice than goat and the little goat I had was made up of bones and fat barely any meat. It did not even taste like curry. Just tasted like the meats broth. I never expected it. I could not even finish my food I was too turned off. Maybe it is because I ordered close to them closing so i will give them another chance but I was not impressed

318,69X4XVef3NRV_LlIvEuXug,3/4/2017,1 star rating,"The ABSOLUTE WORST Jamaican Breakfast I've had in my 'Jamerican' life!I've never felt more compelled to share my thoughts about a meal than today. For the past few weeks I have been excited to experiment with ordering via Seamless as it is finally in my neighborhood. I have tried Indian, Thai, and Jamaican - nothing has wowed me or even encouraged me to re-order. I don't know if all restaurants are mediocre on Seamless, but I have had zero luck. However, today I was so disappointed that I have to warn others.I am an American of Jamaican descent who grew up in a Jamaican household with my Jamaican mom and grandmother. My grandmother was a fantastic cook! My mom...well, let's just say Jamaican food was not her forte. All of that to say, I know good home cooking and when I want Jamaican food (and am not willing or able to try cooking it myself)  I look for the best in my neighborhood. Today, I may have found the worst: T&G Flavors, Inc.This shouldn't be hard. I live in an area that has a considerable West Indian population  - especially Jamaican. So why was my order from T&G Flavors, Inc. so wrong and flavorless? I splurged and treated my family to a Jamaican Breakfast ordering: ackee/saltfish; okra/saltfish; callaloo/saltfish; homemade sorrel; and coconut water. YUM? NOT EVEN CLOSE!So, what went wrong?Issue #1: Why don't Jamaican restaurants have the food on their menus?!My husband (who is Ghanaian and shares similar food tastes) wanted the okra that was on the breakfast menu. I knew they wouldn't have it. Usually, Jamaican restaurants include menu items that they have once every blue moon. Okay, fine, do that. But let the customer know that it is only available on specific days/times and mention the day or times. This deceptive, false advertisement is pervasive at Jamaican restaurants. How is this okay? Cross it off the menu when it is not available, for goodness sake. Or how about saying, ""limited supply"" and actually having some for a portion of the day. OR, assess the demand and have enough supply to meet most of the demand so you make money instead of turning off customer and earning a bad reputation for lying or poor planning.Issue #2: Why doesn't the online menu reflect what is available?This is a restaurant and Seamless issue. Seamless should audit menus as a form of quality control. False advertisement is a bad reflection on the seamless experience. When the menu says that you can select an option for the side, you should be able to select an option for the side! I've never ordered from Seamless without the restaurant calling me back to ask about the order or to tell me that they don't have what was listed. I've even been told that the item ""doesn't come that way."" Huh? I didn't make the item up - it was on the website or app! Wow. Just wow.Issue #3: Why don't you get what you pay for?When I order in person, a Jamaican Breakfast comes with ""provisions"" which means it includes some combination of yam, boiled dumplings, and boiled bananas. You can specify the combination, but if you don't it's usually 1-2 of each. T&G's menu says you can select from the options of yam, banana, boil dumpling, and cassava. It also allows you to ""add fried dumplings."" So, I added fried dumplings for an extra $1 per meal. Each order only had fried dumplings and a scrawny piece of plantain! And the dumplings weren't tasty. They were soaking in the liquid from the callaloo and ackee. No bueño as this spoils the ""fried"" effect. Why not send the dumplings in foil or a container with piercings to let some air in? To add insult to injury, one of the homemade sorrels was not sorrel at all. It was some weird concoction that I think contained fruit punch. I didn't believe my sister when she said it didn't taste right. When I tried it I wanted to punch a wall it was so bad!Issue #4: Why doesn't the food taste good?Am I crazy to expect take-out ordered online to taste good? This restaurant had 4 stars on Seamless (3 on Yelp! - I should have checked Yelp before placing my order). The callaloo was tasteless. It seemed like the salt fish soaked for too long or was old, but it was flavorless as well. The fried dumplings were huge, too dense, and (as mentioned before) soggy. I ended up throwing 3 of them out. What a waste!This poor customer service experience was such an egregious one. I feel duped. No, violated. The dishonest, bait and switch behavior is testing my faith in the online ordering experience. I want to find good options on Seamless that map to my taste buds and my culture. I work hard all week and don't want to have to come home to cook - another form of work for me. I secretly hoped my fave take out spots in the area (Tropical Jerk and St. Best Jerk Spot) would start delivering, but maybe I shouldn't. Seems like delivery service compromises the cuisine."

At 1230 pm on a Wednesday, there was 2-3 people waiting on line? So not too bad even in prime lunch hours Outdoor seating in their make shift outdoor patio."

Came by for a Tuesday lunch with some friends and got the vodka and poached pear slices. At first, I was wondering why the wait was so long, not realizing that the slices are reheated as orders come in, definitely appreciate that touch on a cold winter day! The vodka slice was great, with a rich sauce alongside ricotta and basil. I thought the poached pear slice was good, though mainly just tasted the hot honey compared to the other toppings. There are a few tables outside to enjoy your pizza slices as well! A cool spot near Columbia University."
333,BPLhZ4FildfaCiKLNd0dsA,6/26/2022,4 star rating,"Listen people had a lot to say about the staff here. They are quite cut and dry but I think I've had worse experiences. If you like Foccacia then this kind of pizza is the one for you. The crust is quite thick yet delicate and not doughy at all so you could have more and not feel full. Ordered: Vodka pizza: 5/5Probably one of the best ones from the lot. It has a sweeter note than reg red sauce which complemented the cheese more to me. Marg: 4/5I have no complaints about the marg. It was a good marg. A good safe option. Mushroom: 5/5If you like umami this is for you. Loved the different mushrooms they put on it. It paired with the cheese so well too. Notes: + There is outdoor seating. Not much, but some. - Long lines - Staff might have a reputation for how they act so adjust accordingly. - Extremely small space. Not many extra accommodations (napkins, hand sanitizer, utensils) - On the expensive side. I could have easily had 2/3 slices/squares but I don't know if that was worth the price. Overall a good little switch up to your regular NY slice for the UWS!"

I have returned to MAMA'S TOO twice this past week, for very valid reasons. The pizza is a slice of comfort & happiness. I ordered the Cherry Tomato Bruschetta the first time around, and it was one of the best investments I have made lately. The second time I came, I ordered the Angry Nonna. Both slices were delicious, but if I had to choose one I would definitely recommend the Cherry Tomato Bruschetta. I will say that each slice ranges from $6 to $7, which is not the cheapest slice you can find in the city; however, I truly think that everyone in NYC needs to try this place at least once.  P.S. Ross is one of the workers here, and he is bound to brightened up your day!"
335,BPLhZ4FildfaCiKLNd0dsA,4/7/2023,5 star rating,Amazing and unusual Sicilian slice in the city. Pepperoni or upside down is good. Pear too sweet for me but you may enjoy. Always a line so be prepared.

Came there one evening and was able to quickly and easily place an order for a couple pies since there wasn't a line. Came back shortly after to pick up the pizza and went about my way, no worries.Now, for the pizza itself: holy hell, some of the best in the city by far, no cap, even as a Detroit-style pie. Personally I LOVE the thick pepperoni that cups when in the oven and that's what they're serving up over here. They're also V generous with the toppings portions so you wouldn't be disappointed by that aspect either. Go here fam."
337,BPLhZ4FildfaCiKLNd0dsA,1/3/2023,5 star rating,"Mama's Too has been on my pizza list for a while but only recently made the trek over to the UWS location. The very small counter style interior makes this place feel like a corner slice shop but the offerings are nothing of the sorts. The counter service was quick and I was in and out in less than 5 minutes with a minimal wait on a Saturday morning, albeit was 9 degrees out.The uniqueness of the slices is what makes Mama's Too a must visit spot. If you love pizza, do yourself a favor and visit this place, you will not regret it."

The decor is extremely modern and they even have a full blown bar in the back.When I came, the options were more limited but their menu has since expanded, which is great to know. Their fish is quite fresh and their matcha drink is extremely authentic.We ordered the Ahi Tower, which in my opinion, is a must get. The flavors blend really well together and has the bonus of making for an aesthetically pleasing photo. In addition, we got the 20 piece sushi combo, which to me didn't really stand out too much. The otoro sushi was really good though - very fresh and paired well with the uni that the chef topped it with.The service was good but it was a bit difficult to get their attention when a couple of other tables joined but all in all, a good dining experience that I would love to revisit in the future."

I thought the ambiance was very pretty and it wasn't too crowded. I liked their cocktail options, very asian inspired.As for the food, I thought the portion sizes were extremely small for the prices they were charging. I had the super salmon bowl and the amount of salmon served was probably less than what you would get on a lox cream cheese bagel. The slices were paper thin and maybe only had 4 pieces. In addition to that, we ordered chicken karaage which is Japanese fried chicken. The piece I had was ice cold in the middle. I couldn't even see if it was raw inside because the lighting was dark inside. I didn't want to make a scene so I just put it aside. I think this place has potential but it's definitely not value for money. It's not even worth the money to be honest. I've been to places throughout the city that charges less and provides quality, ample food."

So we saw Shinsen Japanese restaurant literally next door and it had such a cute vibe. We needed a table for 5 and they made it work. Which was incredible. Prices are good and we had a great sake that maybe the manager/owner suggested to us?  The fish was great but the sushi rice was way off. It was too chewy. That's my only dispute of the place. The service, atmosphere, and the freshness of the fish, and the convenience of getting us a table was spot on. Only downfall was the sushi rice, but that is one of those most important parts!  Hopefully it was an off day. In the end, we had a great experience."

They had scowls on their faces and appeared annoyed by customer presence, slopping the food into the bowls with disgust. Going down the line took FOREVER, because they were preparing online/app orders and seemed somehow baffled by the orders. The staff members were literally hooting and hollering, yelling, shouting things at one another, and guffawing. It sounded like a party was going on. The kitchen was a mess, with food, napkins, and other assorted debris on the floor and food prep surfaces. They were out of crispy taco shells and brown rice, and ended up running out of chips. The dining area was also very messy, with floors covered in napkins, lettuce, and forks. The tables hadn't been wiped down, the Tabasco bottles were all gross, there was a shortage of forks, and the garbage and recycling bins were overflowing. People even had to put their garbage in the little space for trays and baskets. I'd rather go without delicious Chipotle than return to this very disappointing and dirty location."

Fine. So I download the app and by the time I am forced to register, and I've navigated it to get my order right, it's 9:50pm and I can't select this location to pickup. The girl who 12 minutes prior instructed me to order on my phone just shrugs and goes ""oh ya since we're closing in 10 minutes it won't let you now. Sorry."" - so, that's it? You can't just make me some freaking food in the middle of a pandemic!? I would've paid cash I would've done anything. To be so rudely shrugged off after wasting my time and not even telling me ""oh by the way if you don't hurry up and get it done a full 10 minutes before we close, you're outta luck"" it was utterly her fault.

The cafe space itself really stands out, with a variety of little tables and barstools for working, a sofa for chatting with friends, outdoor seating so you can share coffee with Fido, and even an additional seating room with toys and books for kids. There's a comfy spot for everyone. The entire front wall of the cafe opens up, so the atmosphere is incredible on a sunny summer day, with a breeze blowing in from the quiet street.The coffee was pretty good, pleasantly tangy. They have super thick mugs that keep your drink nice and hot for ages. Postmark isn't the place to go for a full meal, but they do have pastries, bagels, and sandwiches, which is fine for a light breakfast or study snack."

It really felt like a home and the service was friendly and warm. Great space to chill, work from your laptop or go on a first date. I ordered an iced maple latte with almond milk and light on the ice. It was delicious and reasonably priced. Loved that they had a punch card for every visit. I will definitely be going back to try something else from the menu and perhaps a food item.Cheers!"

I come here frequently throughout my school semester, staying for long periods of time doing schoolwork on my laptop. It does get busy for about half an hour periods when the middle school kids come for lunch or after school, but it's not that rowdy and I manage to focus on work nonetheless. The Internet is great and there are outlets around (took me awhile to realize they're on the legs of the table). I always come here for the ice maple lattes, they taste DELISH and I never really find maple lattes made elsewhere. The pesto sandwich is also very good, isn't too expensive, and fills me up despite how small it looks.If you are in the area, definitely stop by!"

Anyway the coffee is good and the atmosphere is incredible with the door and windows open. And Spotify set on Jazz singers makes me not want to leave. And I see they have a philanthropy aspect to them too! Using the tip money to give to charity is great. Ok it's time to get myself to the pool for my laps. Another mile swim maybe?

I've been getting my chinese food here for years and it's never disappointed. I always get the same two things: general tso's & the fried chicken wings. I've also tried their chicken & broccoli, lo mein, and other things, but those are two I keep going back to. Their food is very tasty, the inside is just like any other chinese food place, but it's cash only! Sometimes when I would order over the phone, the lady would mishear me so I prefer ordering in person. And there have been a time that the lady gave me the wrong order. Nonetheless, I will still come back. When I ordered today, she gave me a free coke & fanta, which was great!If you want to avoid the wait (which is about 10-15 minutes in person), just call ahead for pick up or delivery. Their also open pretty late!"

But after giving in to those Chinese food cravings multiple times throughout my life, I've come to actually appreciate and welcome the curtness here! Just know what you want and don't dilly-dally - you'll be fine!Their food is delicious (Any Broccoli combinations + Fried Chicken Wings + Lomein are my go-tos) and will definitely satisfy your Chinese-American cravings! Now that I've moved away, I've taken for granted their delicious meals. So please do it for me and eat here for my belly's sake!"

Just use the McDonalds as a reference since ""Imperial Taste"" is only a few stores from it. Oh yeah, the restaurant is called ""Imperial Taste"" NOT ""Imperial Wok"" Semantics I know,forgive me. (^_^)What I really enjoy about this particular establishment is the tasty sauce and gravy on the dishes.

Once they gave me orange beef when I ordered sesame beef. When I called the lady said it's the same thing. Last time I ordered in person, to go. Asked for boneless ribs. When handing me the the bag the lady asked ""You ordered ribs?"" I specified boneless she said she'd have to remake them. I waited the 10 minutes and the rest of my food turned into a lukewarm mess. Tonight they left out the rice, one of three things my daughter eats. The lady tells me she'll get it next time.

412,EXtAG3Yi3vfRHA0XWyKlyA,3/29/2018,2 star rating,It started off well enough. I decided to treat myself to a greek omelet for breakfast. I ordered from Rosa's Cafe through Seamless. Rosa called me to confirm my order. She seemed very nice and had a great disposition on the phone. When I received my order the container was crushed leaving half of it open. My omelet was cold.  The lesson I learned: Always ask what the restaurant that you are ordering from what they consider to be a Greek Omelet. My omelet consisted of feta cheese and tomatoes. I have never had one without either spinach or olives in it. Overall I am disappointed in my first experience with Rosa's Cafe.

But this place deserves it. I am a huge advocate for mom and pop businesses but I am also part of a Forbes recognized multi million dollar company, known for our customer service. My order was done through Grubhub, and this location has their own delivery guy to deliver their food through the app. My order was 40 minutes late and obviously cold upon arrival, because the delivery guy went to 41 Street, even though it clearly says 41st Ave. Then once he arrives in the lobby of my hotel, proceeds to tell me I plugged in the wrong address and now his other deliveries are going to be all late because of me. FYI the ST stands for first not Street you idiot, being there's an AVE right next to it. And trust me ladies and gentlemen, there was NO language barrier. Horrible service both through the delivery as well as the women who I dealt with over the phone at this location, who were ABSOLUTELY useless and rude.

417,EXtAG3Yi3vfRHA0XWyKlyA,1/4/2014,5 star rating,"Rosa's is a super-friendly diner near all of the small hotels in Long Island City serving a wide variety of food, but specializes in homey Peruvian food. Everything is fresh and made to order, with the exception of the food that benefits from stewing for longer periods of time, such as the delicious Aji de Gallina, a stew consisting of tender stewed chicken, aji amarillo peppers, garlic, olives, potatoes, all on top of rice. In addition to serving great Peruvian food, Rosa's also juices a number of fresh fruit and vegetable juices at very reasonable prices. And of course, there's a menu full of diner favourites.One tip: the paper menu contains more (and better) options than the menu displayed above the counter.If you're staying in the area, I recommend Rosa's."
418,EXtAG3Yi3vfRHA0XWyKlyA,9/13/2018,5 star rating,"Working remotely (basically out of your car) can be tricky (think bathroom breaks), so I typically look for places to have a quick bite while I prepare for my day/start working. This neighborhood spot is extremely welcoming and feels like a Tia (aunt) is taking care of you. There's plenty of seating on one half of this awesome place and a diner-feeling counter where you can place your order on the other, but you can also order at the tables. You can smell the delicious food being prepared to order (fresh) as you walk up to the place. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. I ordered an everything bagel toasted with cream cheese and bacon (don't knock it till you've tried it) with a strawberry and blueberry smoothie. My whole bill came out to under $10!!!! They even brought it all to my table as it was ready. I went to the restroom and came back to my bagel also on the table! I also was able to use their WiFi which was a HUGE plus! Initially I wasn't able to log in (I kept putting it in wrong) but the girl came all the way over to where I was sitting to help me and it worked. Their bathroom was clean and tidy. Over all, the service, cleanliness and atmosphere are all top notch. I will definitely be back and look forward to becoming a regular. Thank you!!!"

Rosa's Coffee Shop is where I like to fuel up. I don't think my mornings would be the same if I didn't get a Bacon, Egg, & Cheese sandwich on a toasted plain bagel. It's a lovely, cozy, neighborhood shop that's lodged between many of the warehouses that seem to have taken up residence in LIC.The staff is very friendly and when you come there as often as I do, they'll know your order without you even parting your lips. Prices are your typical neighborhood prices and I like the fact that I have the option of using my debit card to pay for my meal. The minimum on debit/credit card purchases are $5, which can easily be spent here.America runs on Rosa, or at least my version of America does."

They have a wall for online pickups which you'll need to use if you have cash because this location is cashless (I guess that makes things move a lot faster).The only thing is there is absolutely no parking around therr.

426,UBUoQ1UDPRioPOb4lJw94w,1/21/2018,2 star rating,"Guys, it's not just salads. This place serves salads and this concoction called a warm bowl, and it's really good I come here pretty often for lunch is it provides large portions, fresh produce, and well thought out flavors. My go to is the harvest bowl, which is a delicious mix of kale, wild rice, chicken, goat cheese, sweet potato, apples and almonds with a balsamic dressing. Around lunch time the lines can get really long so I recommend using their app to order ahead of time, the app also has a payment option which is beneficial as they have a great rewards program. Please note Sweet green does not accept cash. Enjoy!Update: this particular Sweet green is just not as good the rest of them. The customer service here is just bad, the servers are short with you and stingy with the portions. Unlike the 18th st sweet green that will happily alter the ingredients and portions, here they charge for every little change. Many times  I've waited in line while the servers are visibly horsing around in the back while you wait. This place isn't a rep of all Sweet Greens, and it is clearly mismanaged."

Order a harvest bowl and ask a cup for water is my usual. It's enough to share for two people tbh. Sweetgreen is a bit expensive but for the quality, I think it's the best deal than getting a salad from wholefood or anything else. Line can get long therefore, i prefer to order via phone to pick up."

436,jjBcUeE4-Z8VoGFaYkdxvw,1/31/2023,3 star rating,I think this place has great food but the manager really rubbed us the wrong way when we made a reservation and she sat us outside in the cold in a tight space. My cousin is 6'5 and couldn't fit. When we first walked in there were two tables indoors open but she claimed she couldn't give them to us because they were 6 tops and we were only 5. Then she neglected us when we asked if she could at least fix the door outside to keep the cold air out. It's nyc in the middle of winter! Finally a spot opened inside and we got to eat good. The food like I said is great so maybe get it to go or hope for a bar seat. But for larger parties I don't think they're equipped or care much for your comfort.

I always order to go which is normally a breakfast sandwich or bagel with bacon. Which is always good. The other day I actually had the opportunity to dine in I didn't know what to expect. I ordered a Belgian Waffle with a side of home fries and crispy bacon. Yes I like to specify that I get crispy bacon. I must say everything was perfect. Customer service was great. Food was really good and the crispy bacon was perfect. I asked to be seated next to an outlet because I needed to charge my phone and that wasn't an issue at all.

If there is anything that I don't like about the meal that I have been served, the staff is always willing to make it right. The best part of eating at the Silver Spoon is the staff and management! With most restaurants, there might be one or two people (at least) that I may not find very pleasant. However, I can honestly say that the entire staff is friendly and has given great treatment to me, my friends and family when I have brought them here. I have been coming to the Silver Spoon for six years, and plan to continue being a regular. I highly recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a reasonably-priced diner, with good food, in New York City!"

Our waitress was very loud and pushy.  That is certainly not something you should encounter when going to a diner.  When we were getting ready to leave, I had a 10 dollar bill and I asked if she had  2 five-dollar bills. She reminded me that the tip is 18 percent. How incredibly tacky for her to say especially since the service she provided was nothing great.

The last time I called, which happened to be today, they tried to tell me they never charged me for one of the orders. I was insulted. I have the receipt and was clearly charged for everything that I ordered...and I gave a more than reasonable tip for an order that was not fulfilled....once again. So the manager says he will send the missing food item again in less than 30 minutes. Its over an hour. I'm still waiting.  It's my fault for ordering from an obviously incompetent establishment several times, and then expecting a different result. They call that ""insanity."""

My 4 year old had a donut that was roughly the size of his face. Obviously, there will be no more sugar intake today for him. I ordered the three egg platter with sausage links. I'm pretty sure my links were deep fried. I also was given home fries which took up half the plate and toast with butter on the side. My bad on that bit as I should have told them to hold the gluten.My brother had the pancake plate with turkey sausage links. That was oddly sliced in half. We were given a bottle of cranberry juice and a carton of orange juice and a cup of apple juice - all the same price.We all agree that the food was decent. The home fries are intentionally left bland so you can season it the way you like and I did. It needed salt and pepper to liven it up.All in all, I spent roughly $28 before tip on food for three with drinks. I'm return again. Last time I was here, I had a coffee and that was delicious.I'll bring my husband next time and see what his verdict is.Give them a shot. It's solid diner food and the staff seem nice enough.

So having the experience of high quality, homemade Italian foods, I whole heartedly tell you from the bread and EVOO, the wine and cocktails, homemade in-house pastas that we ate, parmesan, and homemade dessert, Manetta's was a food high point of our 8-day stay in NYC. Without any reservations, I strongly recommend Manetta's and will be back with trips to the City that never sleeps. If I had closed my eyes, I would have been at my own Sunday table.

The restaurant is pretty large and has two parts. One part is the dining area and another part is dining area with brick pizza oven.To start I shared a delicious burrata salad with my grandparents. We ordered two and it was too much for the three of us so everyone shared with us and they enjoyed it too. My dad ordered the burrata as an appetizer and my husband got the artichoke. They both really enjoyed it. We also ordered a carafe of the house wine, which was really good.For our entree, I ordered the rigatoni with eggplant. I thought it was just ok. The sauce was good, but the rigatoni was dry. I was told that it was cooked al dente and next time that I should ask for it not to be. Good to know, because I had no idea. I will ask next time and it's a good tip for future diners to know. My husband ordered the veal parm, he loved it. My mother ordered the veal Marsala and so did my father. They really enjoyed their dishes. I got to taste both veals and liked them as well. My grandfather had the hangar steak special. I thought it looked more black and blue than medium. He loved it though. I did not taste it because I do not like my steak cooked below medium well. My grandmother ordered the sea bass special. She enjoyed it and she let me have a taste. I also thought it was cooked really well and it was one of my favorite dishes.For dessert, we ordered a chocolate cake for my husband and my grandfather as well as a cookie platter. The owner came by and was really nice. She even put the cookie platter on the house and they sang happy birthday to my husband. We had a great experience and will definitely be back."

Very clean establishment The young lady in the front was nice and she helped me with my order. Was very hungry so I ordered 2 pieces of Salmon with F.F and veggies, a side of fried shrimp( I had to) and some kind of seafood mix with veggies. The seafood mix had catfish, shrimp and I think crab sticks. On my Salmon I opted for the Honey Ginger sauce. They different sauces you can choose when you order steamed fish. The Salmon was juicy and that Honey Ginger sauce was good, it even taste good with the FF. The veggies are your classic; broccoli, carrot, onion mix. Good not over cooked. The fried shrimp were like little corn dogs...they batter was sweet and they're a reasonable size. The seafood mix was good according to the BF. Said the fish was flaky and well seasoned. Everything else was good. The lady on the cashier even let me try their Green Tea drink was which good and I ended up buying. Give them a try if you're in the area and crave some fish."

I went in for lunch since I work on the block. I asked for a vegetarian lunch special and was offered a choice of 3 dishes plus rice for $6. I got a spicy potato dish, something else I could not identify (but which had great flavors) and a spicy dal.  It was all delicious. The tables were clean and organized with a pitcher of water on each. The owners were present and very interested in my happiness. I will make this a regular stop."

If I'm paying $9 for biryani, atleast fill my container  so it's worth $9. The goat tehari barely had meat. Very little. They also don't have any beef item. Overall very disappointed"
473,JntcefUWQm93rT58DuESNw,11/14/2017,3 star rating,"The place is still fairly new in the neighborhood (about six months old) and I finally had a chance to stop in. They were just opening and setting up and it looked like we were the first customers of the day, which was good since the staff were willing and able to talk a bit about the cooking -- it's an unfamiliar cuisine to many Americans, after all, and it would be unfair to lump it all together in with some generic Indian/South Asian Cuisine, even though they do share some features.  So far I can say the samosas are excellent, my prawns in masala (real prawns, not simply big shrimp, but actual Bay prawns, langoustines, like mini-lobster-tails) were on special and a little pricey but excellent, and their fresh-from-the-tandoor chicken was a transforming experience: I've had tandoori chicken many times before, and for the life of me, I've always been underwhelmed by its failure to translate the flavor, aroma, and spice heat of the marinade ingredients, let alone the flavor and aroma of the chicken, into the thing on your plate. How could anything so filled with spices and tangy yogurt be so bland??? Always a great mystery. This chicken was not that: when poked, this chicken oozed juice that you can smell from a distance, of garlic, ginger, yogurt and spices -- this is the real deal, the tandoori chicken, if I can use a tired metaphor, that I have been waiting for all my life.I'll have to go back very soon and check out the shrimp dopiaza and the goat curry and especially the Bangla national dish of ilish/hilsa fish in various forms. And, and, and... I look forward to it!"

Its in a convenient location in Woodside and has a great family feel to it when you enter. Now let's get to the important part: the food! I went once for breakfast and once for lunch and I must say everything was delicious! If you're in doubt as to what to try, you can't go wrong with their chicken biriyani. It's so rich, flavorful, and tastes how it would when you'd visit your favorite aunt's house. Thumbs way up!"

She remembered our horrible service in early 2018 and the warm OVERPRICED beer we drank.Combing through their most recent Yelp reviews reveals that they probably haven't changed much since. I'm super torn, I'm a Bronx local and this bar is in a prime location at the Arthur Avenue Market. They even hold a Geeks Who Drink event on Wednesdays at 8pm. So then, why are they purposely not fixing their very easily fixed problems!? 1. Expand your beer selection by getting stuff from local breweries. 2. Advertise said selection properly and don't scam people with the prices. EVERYONE loves a decent Happy Hour.3. Partner up with the businesses in the Hall and serve apps/food from Arthur Ave.4. Hire staff that are enthusiastic to work and serve. No sticky tables!5. Have more local events and advertise them. Do they even have a website?It's like they don't care and this place has been open long enough to find people who care. People are starting to notice however, I urge you to try Clinton Hall, which opened up 4 blocks from there and Kirvens up by Lydig. Plus however many other places around the area that are worth a try before this one."

It was that kind of night where no one at the beer hall knew each other but we all got close and sang together and turned it into a party!One of the owners came up to me and introduced himself and proceeded to sing some songs with us.The drinks are great, the music, vibe and people are great.I went for brunch once too and it was absolutely banging. Definitely a Bronx favorite for me but most importantly... it makes the Bronx a better place and you shouldn't have to limit that value to 5 stars!"
485,DGOLOC0kR5FCzvD7X6RNqw,11/26/2018,3 star rating,"How does this sort of place even open in its location? It is plopped right in the middle of an old Italian marketplace (containing the amazing Mike's Deli), where the border between Bronx Beer Hall and the rest of the place is hard to distinguish. The beers are over-priced, but it's really the only adult-leaning bar I'm aware of in the area that isn't also a busy restaurant. When we went in, they still had almost entirely ciders from an event the night before, which limited our options considerably (I like ciders, but wasn't in the mood for one). The server at our table did not remember much about each drink, and there are no physical menus, which all 'beer bars' should have."
486,DGOLOC0kR5FCzvD7X6RNqw,4/12/2016,5 star rating,I really like this place. I've tried different beers all have been pretty good. The service is always friendly and welcoming.  I will definitely keep going here and trying all their different beers and delicious food.They have happy hour Mon-Thurs is buy one get one. On Fridays they have a different deal with larger beers ( still a really good deal) The Buffalo Chicken Pizza is my favorite thing to eat.Go for Happy Hour and try it out :)
487,DGOLOC0kR5FCzvD7X6RNqw,10/6/2018,2 star rating,"Note: they're in the middle of the market so don't go looking for them on the street. If you're going to charge over $9 for average NY craft beer, maybe list the the damn prices, or tell people there's a $3+ discrepancy between beers when they ask for a beer list and you only point them to your computer screen. The cans were better and cheaper than drafts. Again, when I asked about what they had, they only pointed me toward the 5 drafts listed on a screen. The 6th had kicked, and 1 was a cider, so really only 4 beers. I later noticed some cans on a shelf and asked about them, then was magically told about the (slightly) larger can & bottle selection, after I had a decidedly average $9 draft I wouldn't have gotten had I know there were other options. The service was friendly and they had a few decent cans, so 2 stars. Won't be going back here. If I want to pay those prices, l'll stay in Manhattan and at least go to an actual bar with some ambience, not a space in the middle of a market where they don't really know much about beer. I witnessed someone ask about a lighter, wheat beer and get recommended an IPA. Not even close."
488,DGOLOC0kR5FCzvD7X6RNqw,10/25/2018,3 star rating,"I love this place because its a local ""watering hole"" and I enjoy the unique setting in the middle of the Arthur marketplace. I also love that they lend this space for some cool events. But damn, they need to get it together. When visiting on a busy Saturday night during an event, for instance, they usually have about three bartenders. It's become clear to me that there is no system to efficiently serve everyone. I totally understand that managing and serving a bar is no easy task because drunk and impatient customers. But, usually the bar tenders seem unorganized. I've had 2 bar tenders ask to take my drink, back to back. If there are 3 of ya, at least divide the bar into 3. Or have 2 tending, 1 charging. And its not like they're making drinks either, they're just serving beers. They've been open long enough to have at least come up with a game plan."

The first thing I noticed was that this place had a weird smell and there was some kind of meat being sold towards the back. And then I turn around and see some kind of souvenir(?) store, I guess. I don't know, honestly. There was just too much going on here for my taste. This place is pretty big, don't get me wrong- it's just sectioned awkwardly.So my friend and I go sit at the bar for some drinks- they only sell beer and wine here. But they don't have the basic beers like Corona, Bud Light, etc. They had that IPA ish I don't like, lol. We asked for a sample of an IPA and I did not enjoy it. And to add to that, the bartender was just WEIRD! Lmao. She was just off. I myself am getting confused writing this review, because that was the vibe this place gave me.Returning?

Just got back from a quick jaunt there. Ordered a lemon bar frappacino ( now officially on their menu too with the 5 or so other customer picks) and an iced peppermint soy latte. Latte didn't have peppermint and frappe was made with the wrong ingredients and separated immediately ( have had it before and has never done this so much).

Also, they sometimes don't have said Foldovers (or bagels!) despite the mobile app saying they do.Ambiance: No seating room. I didn't realize how much I liked this about Starbucks until I walked into one without it. This may be because it's in an area where most people are just dropping by to grab something before work, but it's a PITA. When there's a long line, the place gets SERIOUSLY cramped. Speaking of which, there usually isn't too much of a line, but it does get a bit crowded around 8:30ish AM. Also, the milk/sugar/napkin station can be a little messy.I went to this place because it was the closest one to my workplace. I guess instead of walking a minute past my office to get my morning kick, I'll just have to pick it up an extra minute's walk away... on my way there. Or at one of the other 10 Starbucks (Starbuckses?) within a three block radius. Sigh."
523,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,7/11/2015,2 star rating,I am a die hard Starbucks lover despite trying not to be. Some locations aren't managed well. This location is frequently overwhelmed by customers and quite understaffed.  I do find the staff very friendly. The very small awkward space doesn't help the situation. Just got back from a quick jaunt there. Ordered a lemon bar frappacino ( now officially on their menu too with the 5 or so other customer picks) and an iced peppermint soy latte. Latte didn't have peppermint and frappe was made with the wrong ingredients and separated immediately ( have had it before and has never done this so much). Employees openly said they didn't know how to make it and didn't look it up. Disappointing :(
524,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,10/9/2011,4 star rating,"Long lines during the morning rush hour and I've noticed around 2-3pm. Otherwise, fast service when you need a quick cup of coffee, or let's be honest, a dessert coffee drink.Not a location where you can sit but they still offer wifi. The other day I saw a guy standing by the window on his laptop so if you are in dire need of wifi you can find a way to make it work here, though I can't guarantee it'll be comfortable. You can go up to the Nassau St. location for seating but they aren't as fast and there's usually a longer line.Really friendly service here, and I've never had my order messed up....yet *knocks on wood*Never had to wait more than a minute for my drink, though I do frequent this place at random times of the day, say around 11am or anytime after 4pm when there is usually no line. The pastry fridge is always fully stocked, too. Always."
525,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,6/2/2014,1 star rating,"I usually love Starbucks; I got a hot skinny vanilla latte here, and it was so horrible that I couldn't drink even half of it. This wasn't the first time I've had this drink.And I really needed some coffee."
526,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,9/8/2015,5 star rating,"I love love this Starbucks branch! They spell my name right ALL THE TIME, they are very friendly and efficient. I've never stayed longer than 5 mins no matter how long the line."
527,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,12/2/2015,1 star rating,"Tried this location a few times as it is closest to my work. The chai latte is terrible, regardless of time of day. Obviously this drink should be two ingredients, both store bought - but they continuously top of my drink with hot water or cold milk when they miscalculate and have never added enough chai to the drink. 4$ for nothing!"
528,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,4/21/2014,5 star rating,"This is my favorite Starbucks location in the area. The staff is so friendly and the service is quick. I'm usually in and out of there within 5 minutes (10 minutes tops). It is smaller than the average Starbucks but the service is relatively quick so you won't be waiting long. There is no place to sit, so it's a 'grab coffee quick' kinda place but that's fine by me because I usually only come here either in the mornings or for a coffee break."
529,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,6/20/2007,4 star rating,"This is a tiny Starbucks location nestled in the 100 William St building.  There's really no seating options (or bathroom) inside, however there are a handful of tables outside.  It's busy every day during morning rush hour, but the staff is great and keeps things flowing and reasonably clean."

Although there were only three 5-8 people in the pub during my visit, I can imagine that this place has a more relaxed vibe than other places in the area. Plus the pub's jukebox was rocking all of the top hits from the late 90's and early 00's - one of my favorite ""eras"" of music. The food is pretty typical for pub-style food. You will not get gourmet-style burgers here, but they will satisfy your hunger. The burgers are HUGE for the price tag of seven bucks. My burger and salad satisfied my appetite, especially after running 13 miles. The bartender on staff seemed really cool and down to earth. Hopefully, other folks on the staff have a similar disposition."

Of course, the crowd is of all types....this can be a plus or a minus depending on who YOU are. Happy hours galore and plenty of people to talk to.

For the second round we went with margarita on the rocks for both of us . The drinks also came in nice size cups filled to the top not those flimsy plastic cups that most places give you . Now for the food it was good I got the Mckennas famous grilled cheese which came with bacon , cheddar cheese and tomatoes on rye bread ( I believe it was rye bread ) it also comes with pesto sauce but I chose not to put that on mines but overall it was realllyyy good I got it with a side of onion rings which could have been better I thought they were going to be beer battered onion rings but instead I got frozen food / fast food onion rings. My friend got a cheeseburger and steak fries which he enjoyed as well . The only downfall of this place is even though we were sitting down at a table we had to go to the bar to get our food and drinks when it was ready I don't know  if they were short staffed or if that's how it works here but overall this place was cool I would come back next time I definitely will make it for happy hour ."

I got there and around 5 and it was already a little crowded, but after about 10mins I was able to grab a seat at the bar. I ordered a whiskey sour which was made pretty strong, and I ended up babysitting it for a hour (don't judge me). They give you a different colored token based on the price of the drink you ordered, and you can redeem it for a free drink. You have to redeem it before the happy hour ends, but I overheard the bartender tell someone that you can come back and use it another day so that's definitely a plus. When I first got there, they were playing a lot of pop music, but as the night went on a new group took over the jukebox and hip hop and rap started blaring through the speakers. Not sure if it's a jukebox you pay for or what, but I saw ppl hovering in that area. Drinks are reasonable, $10 for whiskey sour.

We  arrived at 7:40pm  so we just missed the happy hour that stopped at 7pm but that's cool we still got drinks I started off with a rum punch and my friend had a margarita for our first round with drinks were good and strong . For the second round we went with margarita on the rocks for both of us . The drinks also came in nice size cups filled to the top not those flimsy plastic cups that most places give you . Now for the food it was good I got the Mckennas famous grilled cheese which came with bacon , cheddar cheese and tomatoes on rye bread ( I believe it was rye bread ) it also comes with pesto sauce but I chose not to put that on mines but overall it was realllyyy good I got it with a side of onion rings which could have been better I thought they were going to be beer battered onion rings but instead I got frozen food / fast food onion rings. My friend got a cheeseburger and steak fries which he enjoyed as well . The only downfall of this place is even though we were sitting down at a table we had to go to the bar to get our food and drinks when it was ready I don't know  if they were short staffed or if that's how it works here but overall this place was cool I would come back next time I definitely will make it for happy hour ."

Was in the area looking for a good happy hour spot and their 2for1 happy hour that goes until 8pm cannot be beat! I got there and around 5 and it was already a little crowded, but after about 10mins I was able to grab a seat at the bar. I ordered a whiskey sour which was made pretty strong, and I ended up babysitting it for a hour (don't judge me). They give you a different colored token based on the price of the drink you ordered, and you can redeem it for a free drink. You have to redeem it before the happy hour ends, but I overheard the bartender tell someone that you can come back and use it another day so that's definitely a plus. When I first got there, they were playing a lot of pop music, but as the night went on a new group took over the jukebox and hip hop and rap started blaring through the speakers. Not sure if it's a jukebox you pay for or what, but I saw ppl hovering in that area. Drinks are reasonable, $10 for whiskey sour. The back has a lot of space where you can come with a group of friends. Will definitely be visiting this spot again."

It's not expensive, the menu has exactly what you'd expect (i.e. sandwiches, salads, burgers, and appetizers you can get from the supermarket frozen section), and the bartenders were nice. I see a lot of people talking about the bad service in the other reviews, and I definitely didn't have the same experience. Yes, you will have to look past the mediocre air conditioning, the dark back of the restaurant, and a slight stale smell in the atmosphere. But that's what a bar like this is supposed to be! I'm not here for no 5 star treatment. I'm here to talk loudly with my friends, chow on a damn good meatball sub that I won't be ashamed of if some sauce spills on my shirt, and pound down a couple pints to wash it all down, all while everyone else is doing the same. Protip - really recommending that meatball sub, btw"

There are also pretty good dipping sauces. These are a treat I like to enjoy with my daughter. Plus they are SO much better than getting a snack from a fast food place, look up the nutritional info for the basics, they aren't that bad. They don't leave a greasy, heavy feel in my stomach. I find these way tastier than hot dog vendor pretzels, those ones have zero flavor."

The flavors were bold and complex, but not overly spicy, which was a relief for someone like myself who can't handle too much heat. The portion sizes were on the smaller side, but I didn't mind as it allowed me to try a few different dishes without feeling overly full. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to try authentic Szechuan cuisine without being overwhelmed by spice. Could definitely be spicier though!"

My family and I ordered less conventional dishes and would readily recommend them to anyone wanting to try something different. Mao Xue Wang - blood curd, tripe, and intestine bathed in chili oil broth. I love this more than the classic Szechuan boiled fish dish because of the more uncommon offerings. Mala Shredded Eel - eel braised in green pepper, peppercorns, and wood-ear mushrooms.Claypot Beef Stew - Chunks of beef and tendon with tiny potatoes."

Was def nervous that the food would be too spicy but we told the waiter to put everything at the least spice level and it was really good!  The aesthetics of the entire restaurant brought me back to authentic restaurants in China. Very nicely decorated and even the utensils were really pretty. My family loved the jasmine tea. The teapot was a nice black copper pot. The pork slice belly appetizers were really good!! Would def recommend getting it to try out. It didn't taste very oily and the garlic sauce really added to it. I really liked the shuai zhu beef that we ordered. The meat was very tender and soft. We also got shi gua (a type of melon) and that was also really good. We got an eel dish was a bit too salty and flavorful for our taste, so we ended up packing it. Would def recommend getting a bowl of rice to eat with everything because it is very flavorful."
576,idha1p-gDIbkNFF-PfWmEA,4/11/2022,5 star rating,"First time having authentic Szechuan food. Plenty of Sichuan peppercorns, garlic, and dried chili peppers in the dishes. The restaurant is decorated like a traditional Chinese tea house with dark wooden furniture, Asian plants, a koi pond with fat koi fish near the entrance, and hanging lantern lights. Staff were highly trained and professional. Crowded restaurant on a weekday night. Limited indoor seating only. Quite expensive but worth the quality of the experience and the food. Mandarin-speaking only. Clientele is 90% Chinese. @ Swing pork belly with chili garlic sauce (4/5) - cold dish of thin strips of boiled pork belly and cucumber on a cute wooden rack (like hanging your clothes on a line traditionally), pairs well with the chili garlic sauce, which is very very garlicky and salty, pretty small portion, quite appetizing@ Beef tongue in chili (3.5/5) - beef tongue was cooked perfectly, tender medium-cut slices arranged neatly in chili, served chilled, not my favorite because the tongue could have been thinner and chili didn't have as much as flavor as the other dishes@ Fish in soup with chili (2.5/5) - many fish dishes are recommended here as the specialty, was hard to decide how to order based on the variety of choices, ended with a type of white fish in a soup populated with chili, cucumber, garlic. Fish was tender, not much to eat with the sheer amount of dried chili's in the soup, soup wasn't all that pleasant to sip at either@ Teppan shrimp (3/5) - garlicky shrimp on a teppan (metal plate for teppanyaki), whole thing is edible, flavors all on the shells after all@ Mapo tofu (4.5/5) - most authentic Mapo tofu, have to get it at a real Szechuan restaurant to get the real deal, not the sweet and salty and slightly spicy fast food versions, the sour and mala (numbing-ness) was amazing. My lips were tingling happily. Not ""spicy"" as we are used to. @ Rice - absolutely needed for some of the dishes here. The sauces go well. Rice isn't anything special @ Complimentary tea - perfect with the food. Smooth tea in a black kettle on a small heating source at the table. A little suspicious that we were given paper cups because ""ran out"" when a white group was seated in the next five minutes and they were given the usual porcelain cups. tl;dr imagine Chinese house in the mountains with koi fish, quite expensive so come with a group ready to share dishes together with rice, staff speak Mandarin, menu is partially in Chinese only, come early or call to try to get on the wait-list (took us 45 minutes for a group of 5 on a weekday night). Food is authentic Szechuan cuisine, Mapo tofu was quite good, swing pork comes with nice garlicky sauce, wish I could try some of the other dishes (like the salted egg corn they ran out of, the eel, frog, etc.)"

It came out towards the end of our hour long meal. It took so long that we thought they ran out of swing sets and surveyed the restaurant LOL when it finally arrive the pork was looking DRY - it mustve been swinging too long out there.I am sad to say, but i think i need to find myself a new szechuan spot."

I don't have a high spice tolerance but I really enjoy spicy food that has good flavor, which you can count on if you eat at Szechuan Mountain House. I came with a group and we got the La-Zi Chicken, Braised Pork Belly, Pineapple Fried Rice, and Golden Corn Kernels. Everything was amazing. The la-zi chicken was very very hot but very very good eaten with rice. I liked the pineapple on the fried rice - gives a new spin! Can't go wrong with a braised pork belly - super super rich and delicious. I was doubtful about the Golden Corn Kernels but I actually think that was one of my favorites. With a spoon of rice and La-zi chicken and pork belly -- chef's kiss! Best combination of flavors in my mouth.Highly recommend, worth the wait! :)"

It was not a numbing spice and it was an enjoyable meal with my friends. I recommend coming slightly before peak dinner time so as to avoid a long wait."
583,AxpsI4_tOI0sM6-KfOY9ig,8/12/2022,1 star rating,"Update: still no gluten free pasta because apparently the manager does not want to change things and wants to keep the menu consistent (across restaurants? Across time? Unsure). Despite the fact that the restaurant offers whole wheat pasta and has only one box in house, they will not do the same for gluten free pasta because again, years ago it did not sell for a few months. When I left feedback for the restaurant about this, I was told I could order a salad. There are plenty of Italian restaurants in the neighborhood, city, state, and world (including Italy itself) that offer gluten free pasta as an option - no need to patronize this one."

Went with my wife and parents and it was bad from the start: after taking a while to get to us, the waiter walked away halfway through taking our order - just walked away, without saying anything. The waiters seemed super busy doing stuff, but the restaurant was pretty empty. We waited for a while and eventually he came back to take the rest of the order and tell us he'd put the appetizers in. The appetizers came, and they were really really good, but immediately after, two of the four entrees came out while we were still working on the appetizers. The easier of the two entrees - pizza and a calzone - came literally a half hour later (we timed it), requiring several reminders to the wait staff, All the food was super good - the red sauce is really special, and the calzones had great texture and flavor. The bill came and we didn't get an apology or any mention of how bad the service was. Nobody was really that upset - we still tipped 20% and didn't say anything because we chalked it up to shortstaffing - but just know that I thought my experience would be a useful one to share."

The host asked us how many my mom said 3 people they told us to wait we sat at a bar and waited a family of 3 came in that seemed to know the host they asked for a table for 3 , 5 min later they were being seated , we spoke to the host and waiter they lied about why they sat them first we were seated next , after 20 min no one asked us what we wanted but the family's that came after us had drinks and some food . So I get up and ask the host again what's going on ? The humiliation was being noticed by everyone at this point ! The family next to us said it's disgusting & just shook their heads at us being treated bad because we weren't white ! The Mexican servers are racist & pushy , tripping over them self to attend the white guest only while the Latinos that were here first are being ignored ! You might not know us by name there because we go to eat we pay our food and we leave ! Nothing more nothing less was expected until we were met with racism. People of color & Latinos don't eat at la villa ! We're not welcomed by the Mexican waiters & im sure by  management as well ! -We left and went to Nubleu  2 blocks away . The owner Greta and the host made up for the terrible hurtful time at la villa , the food was amazing the decorations the music ... save the heartache and go to Nubleu , I promise it's worth the trip!!!"

Before when we get the Rice Balls they usually deliver the entree with in minutes but we waited the same time for the entrees like the rice balls. When they dropped off the entrees  they never came back to check and never dropped off Parmesan cheese and crushed peppers like they used to. At the end we had to always flag down for a server and get up to get our check and even had to get up and pay for the order. Yes it would make sense to get less attention when the restaurant is busy but it was not. I am really disappointed in the service we got.. the food was also okay.. but at least the Chicken Parm that we go was the same as usually very good.

Just try them all, can't go wrong with it. AMBIANCE: Small hole in the wall cafe style. Cute interior decor and all. You can sit inside if it's not crowded, it's usually not during the day time.

Perhaps not. But I sure did expect (at least hope) that the mochi would be faintly comparable. Well, it wasn't. I think the 4-star and 5-star raters of mochii probably rated it that high because of the different fillings they were able to get inside the mochi exterior. We didn't try any of those as we weren't looking for mochi ice cream and such. I'm sure I'd be offering a better review if I weren't looking for authentic Japanese mochi. In case you're wondering, we got the skewers with the 3 mochi balls (condensed milk, strawberry, and matcha). The colors were different, but they tasted pretty much the same. Since I have nothing bad or good to say, I offer this place a middle-of-the-road rating of 3-stars."

I can't say it's as AUTHENTIC as Japan's, but it is a familiar taste. The mochi is soft and fresh, i'm almost positive they make it fresh to order. They had the cutest indoor setting with pillows, beanbag chairs, and other cute kawaii decor -- and whoever had the aux knew exactly how to set the right vibe for chats over mochi! WHAT WE ORDERED:- Mochi Ice Cream - One taro and one green tea. These came cut in half and skewered so you can see the ice cream wrapped in a layer of mochi. Just the right amount of sweet and so tasty - Mochi Daifuku - One strawberry + Fruit Loop. The textureee was like a Mochi wrapped cloud of whipped filling and a little iced strawberry in the center like a hidden treasure- Mochi Bites - We got the Kinako (soybean) flavor which is the same as Korean Injeolmi. These mini mochi balls come warmed which is great in between the cool ice creams RATING: 10s across the board for amazing texture, taste, and atmosphereWe got the:Green tea + Taro Mochi ice cream:The ice cream is so good and the wrapped mochi is nice and chewy. Since it's frozen, the mochi is quite hard so i'd give it a minute before biting in. These came cut in half and skewered so you can see the ice cream wrapped in a layer of mochi. Just the right amount of sweet and so tasty Kinako Bites:This was my favourite! It's perfectly bite size pieces, warm, pillowy and melts in your mouth. This roasted sweet soybean flavor is the same as Korean Injeolmi, which is always a treat.

Most places have gotten real stingy with the meat and cheese. Not Niforo's! The staff here is incredibly friendly and more accommodating than at literally any other ""lunch-y"" deli type spot I have ever been to in my life. The bread they use for their heroes is impressive and definitely not the cheap crap you get at most so called Delis these days. I have also had the cheesesteak here and it was better than most. I haven't gotten to try out their breakfast yet, but I will definitely be back to do so."

Used to come here all the time after work, and initially I hated it, but it grew on me due to the friendly service (bartender always remembered my name, my drink order, and the orders of half my giant team), and the fact that it wasn't obscenely crowded the minute it hit 6pm on a Thursday or Friday. I've reached the point where I'm no longer willing to put up with people spilling beer on me at Ulysses, and am now more drawn to places where there's actually a place to sit. I wouldn't say this is an all seasons bar... it's definitely kind of dark and depressing when it's warm and sunny out. The food here is also surprisingly not bad (I don't know if I'd call it ""good"" but definitely better than my admittedly low expectations)!"

You kinda forget it exists but every time you go back, you remember why you like it. the ambiance is super relaxed, and the drinks are served quickly and are delicious. the food is pretty good for typical bar food. Nothing spectacular, but definitely good enough to keep me coming back. They also were able to quickly accommodate a going away party, and it was super affordable for the amount of people we had. I definitely wasn't expecting them to be so great, but they went above and beyond, giving us a private area on a moments notice.Lastly, my ONE issue with this place is the bathrooms. Nothing to do with the cleanliness or anything, but please PLEASE, put the bathroom signs in English instead of galic. I almost always screw it up when I'm drinking."

Although I didn't actually drink any beer, they had a good selection on tap."

Their menu is vast and invigorating, always excited to try a new meal every time I walk in! That being said, if you do not order the salmon at least once every 4 trips, you are doing something wrong. My one issue with this refined establishment is their lack of domestic beers on tap, I would suggest adding a local brewery to their mix, possibly Torch and Crown (great beer!)."

They love the interior because it reminds them of home. The very large dining area in the back is a favor for some quiet chatting or some noise celebrating. For me it is only a short walk from our office building so it is easy to run down for a drink and snack and run back to finish some late work.We usually start with a Half Platter for $36; it includes wild wings, mozzarella sticks, crisp fried calamari, chicken fingers with sauces and garnish with veggie sticks.They have a full platter for $52 but everyone prefers the half platter for some reason.The cocktails are mostly $10 each (favors are the  Hazelnut chocolate martinis) so it is beer for most of us. Overall, it is cozy and a nice place to stop for a drink."
619,HzmjJ1mM0WdOHbfYm5mxqw,12/1/2014,4 star rating,I really like this place. I was on a short lunch break and was actually going to just get take out from here. However when I walked in the atmosphere was so warm and relaxed! So... I decided to stay. Lol. The bartender was nice enough. I ordered the portobello on ciabatta. AMAZING!!! My only issue was timing. I ordered a mushroom with cheese on bread. It took 25 minutes to get my food with only five other people (who were already eating) in the restaurant. Nevertheless I will be back... When I am not pressed for time.

They didn't like their drinks so they asked the waiter to send them back. He said that we would still be charged even though they had taken 2 sips max. We asked to speak to a manager, and there was none around. HOW IS THERE NO MANAGER DURING DINNER?!!! We were told to get up and talk to the bartender, who said ""Well that's what you ordered."" My friends said they know they ordered, but they didn't like it. After an uncomfortable stare off they were able to change their drinks.Solid burgers, although they don't know how to cook a medium burger. It came out completely raw in the middle, and after sending it back they brought it back medium well. Please note that I rarely send anything back, so for my party to do this more than once meant the first try was unacceptable. Subpar service."

My Fiancé & I had our date night here, it was empty for the weekend except for 2 girls in a booth. Our waitress was nice & attentive but the food & who prepared it was another story! We ordered custom made poke bowls, don't order poke here! When we got them, my Fiancé & I looked at eachother & said ""wow these are real small"". They were the smallest poke bowls we have ever seen (the pic really doesn't showhow small they were because of the angle) and they were so underwhelming! The fish were warm, isn't raw fish supposed to be consumed cold?? Anyway we both started looking through the menu to order rolls as well because we were still hungry all of a sudden we heard a loud sneeze behind the counter (sushi making station) the one who prepared our bowls (the one with the black frame glasses),  had his mask down (under his chin) the whole time (what's the point?!) he sneezed on the counter, looked up & didn't move, didn't go to the sink to wash or wash the counter -NOTHING! My fiancé said ""did he cover his mouth at all?"" Since I was facing the kitchen, I said ""No! Let's get outta here"" so we asked for the check. As we were getting the check the same disgusting guy sneezed AGAIN bent towards the counter and he & I made eye contact when he looked up, he looked embarrassed and looked away and I was like ""Wow, again nothing? No washing & his mask is down""..my fiancé & I said we're never coming here again! GROSS! Cleanliness & hygiene should ALWAYS be TOP PRIORITY but after have gone through a pandemic especially and still having to cautious of it..you'd think people would change. Not at ""Super Sushi""! They should call themselves ""super germs"". Also our two small poke bowls & two green teas were around $36, we've gotten bigger & better poke bowls at actual poke bowl stations for MUCH less! We ended up going to a Greek restaurant afterwards since we were still hungry and had a crappy date night here."
627,MHbxF-ZS918-ZoXKQPBEyg,11/24/2021,3 star rating,"We went for the all you can eat for $26.99 at dinner. They had hot foods and sushi. We ordered tempura shrimp, eggplant, gyoza, Rangoon (cream cheese wrapped fried in wonton skins) was just strange, fried calamari, bbq squid. The only thing from that list that I like was the fried eggplant. The rest not so good, too fried and oily. The hot food selections was ok but the raw foods had a very nice large selection and fresh.We ordered sushi, hand rolls, sashimi and special rolls. It was presented beautifully in a wooden boat! Also the sushi came with just the right amount of rice with a perfect size of raw fish and not over sized. Many of the all you can eat places gives you lots of rice and very thin raw fish in their sushi. The best was the white tuna sashimi so fresh and fatty. The rest was good, for the price point especially with the rising food prices due to Covid in Bay Ridge. You can't beat the price for the amount and quality of food. We enjoyed it very much. Dessert was red bean and green tea ice cream. The green tea ice cream was one of the best I've ever had, such a strong green tea taste. Green tea ice cream that I've had in the past can taste like seaweed or so light, it's more vanilla than green tea.I would go to this place again especially living so close by. The service was adequate."

629,MHbxF-ZS918-ZoXKQPBEyg,4/1/2022,1 star rating,"I hardly ever give one star ratings but this place is not worth going to.  It is not managed well, and the seafood, while not unsatisfactory, was inferior to sushi I've had elsewhere. The fish just did not have any flavor to it.  Looks like management purchased the cheapest quality of fish out there. And service was horrifically slow.  I had to get up three times to request different items.  Will not be going back."

They have different party trays with combinations of classic rolls and special rolls. We ordered using ""First Order QR code"", but it said there was an Error. So, I went to their website and the same promo was listed. That didn't work either. In the end, we just ordered without the discount. The special roll was ok. It looked small and was not anything special. The other classic rolls were also ok. They tasted fine, but portions were not big. I like bigger, more fresh sushi and rolls. They weren't as tasty as our other takeout sushi party tray place. So, we will probably not be going back for party tray takeout for dinner."

I enjoyed the salty chocolate chess pie and my partner had the blueberry crumb. The salty chocolate chess pie hit the spot! It was almost like a gooey brownie with a buttery flaky pie crust; the saltiness definitely helped to balance out the sweetness. I really enjoyed it and would get this again or consider getting a whole pie if I needed something for a party. My partner enjoyed the blueberry crumble very much; I took a bite and liked it but it wouldn't be my favorite (just personal preference). They were a bit expensive as the total came out to about $14 for the 2 slices. Considering I'm usually happy to go to other bakeries for a cookie or cupcake for $3-4, it felt a bit pricey, but I would argue that sometimes it can be worth it (like for the salty chocolate chess pie!)"

The banana cream pie is a home run!  For vegans they offer a sour cherry pie which is really good as well. The interior has a chill vibe, and the staff is awesome, and helpful.

Their pear is yummy too.  The crust is buttery and flaky. And if you can afford the extra charge -- add their maple whip to your slice. So creamy and so perfect up top any slice.Slices are generous in size, and could be shared if necessary. But really, you're going to want your own slice.  And you're going to want to hang out for a bit...  gosh, this place is so cute and just so good."

First of all, the order took forever and when I finally received it, my heart sank with disappointment.  My savory pies were completely burnt and the apple pies were tiny! I hate to waste money and we were really hungry, so we all just dug in. A few minutes later, my stomach started to gurgle. I'm the vegetarian of the house, so I had the cheese and onion pie to myself. I look at the package and notice the date on the box was from two days ago! I check on my kids' empty chicken pot pie box and luckily it was made that day.  In the corner of my eye, I see my son goin for his first bite of the apple pie. I take a look at that box and these were made two days ago as well! I had to slap the fork out of his hand with the quickness! Folks...I am currently writing this on the toilet with violent diarrhea and my kids  trying to 409 the shit out of some fermented apple pie on our living room rug. Proceed with Caution!"

But I couldn't help it. I had to tell Petee all about how we're pie people. How I get her pies for birthdays and parties. How we had pie at our wedding, because fuck cake. And she said, ""Team Pie!""You're goddamn right, Petee. I'm on Team Pie, and you're our captain.O Captain, My captain, I want to jump up on a desk like Robin Williams and tell you that I love the wild blueberry, the sour cherry, and the strawberry rhubarb (your manager Morgan's favorite, evidently, and he has good taste). The banana cream pie will make my wife love me again when I've done something stupid, and everyone seems to love the salty chocolate chess, even though chocolate desserts are not as good as fruity desserts.

I was in the area and got a slice of the cranberry strudel. I did not see a sign anywhere or any note on the menu mentioning some of their pies having any nuts. I have a severe peanut allergy and I'm always aware to look out for such things. When I came home I took a small bite of my slice when I noticed there were pieces of nuts on it. My husband ate them and confirmed they were peanuts. I was extremely upset by this because I could've had an anaphylactic reaction had I not noticed the nuts myself. I called this morning to tell them what happened.  I was told by a customer service rep ""well everything is baked in the same oven"" then I got a bland apology and was told if I came in person today I could get a refund. I live far away so that was not going to be a possibility. Overall I'm extremely disappointed because I feel like they were not concerned how dangerous a mistake like this could be.

But today I ordered, and the person taking my order continued a conversation with the barista (on the other side of the counter), and then my order was announced by someone who was standing nearby.

But today I ordered, and the person taking my order continued a conversation with the barista (on the other side of the counter), and then my order was announced by someone who was standing nearby.

As a barista myself, from an actual coffee shop in Honolulu, at one of the biggest and busiest locations, I understood if they were busy and busting their balls working--but picture this: it was 745 and slow, no one was in there. Customer service was terrrrrible!!! The closing crew sucked. The barista was amazing, but the support crew sucked. She said, ""she hates working at this location"" AND to top it off, instead of tending to customers, she tended to her friend who was visiting. My simple iced tea drink took more than 10 minutes and she kept warning us, ""we're closing!!"". She also turned away a customer who came in before closing. It was terrible. Service was terrible. I would never visit again:) and I hope management figures it out because they really sucked :) they made New Yorkers seem rude!"

I placed my mobile order at 10:23 am knowing I have to be two blocks down to work by 10:40 I really didn't expect to get my order at 10:40. Super upset as I watched this entire process of my order being ignored. As I entered I check the mobile station and I knew my drink wasnt there because it's green usually pops out. I was pretty patient after 7 minutes I asked one of the workers if they had my order she said someone is working on it and went back to steaming milk. There was a worker who seemed to be on the ice station he literally made a few drinks went to the back and said I'm out through up the piece sign then left the store...I was so confused...like who is making my drink. Two minutes later I see a worker back on the ice station but this time he made a drink literally for himself then walks to the back I was like wth is going on. Around 10:37 I had to woosah then try to get someone else's attention. The same girl from earlier saw me standing there and said wow you didn't get your drink yet. I told her to please rush my order I was soooo pissed they made me late to work and my drink finally being made tasted like crap. I will definitely never be back to this location. This was such a horrible experience, definitely need new management, a new team...it was a hot mess."

669,BYOxFf1eg66kWDK8KOvNeQ,10/24/2019,4 star rating,"One of the last Starbucks in the city with power outlets. You can tell they're getting ready to make the switch though. There are a ton of sealed up and sanded down patched where you can see they've begun removing them little by little. Even still, you can pretty much close your eyes and point in any direction to find an open outlet either in the floor baseboard or wall. The staff has that highschool clique feel and they always greet you with a smile. The taller dark skin dude that opens reminds me of Kid Cudi. And hell yell your name and then immediately follow it with a rhyme.I also like this Starbucks for the customer base. Older more seasoned crowd and they always plop down in their flip flops and Polo hoodies and read the Huff Post or get on a conference call with their air pods. The bathrooms are shitty though. Never any toilet paper and the floor is always wet. I hope its just water from washed hands. Great part of the LES hopefully the outlets stick around"

The floors have paper and lids strewn about - counters are dirty. The bathroom is one of the most disgusting I have ever been in. Given a choice, campgrounds are in better shape. The coffee took 15 mins to get, and while I watched the barista make it, realized he was NOT using non-fat milk. I had asked for sweetener to be pre-added, he forgot. Extra- hot, he forgot.  I walked to the counter to add my own: no stirrers. I pointed this out- they had none. Anywhere. WTF? I have to say ONE guy here actually cares. Ge offered to re-do it all and he was not the one who messed it up. He was frantically trying to fix everyone's issues. His name is Andre and honestly he deserves a better workplace situation.

Additionally, I waited 15 MINUTES for my iced tea and people who ordered after me got their drinks first. Not only that, but I watched the barista add in only a tiny bit of black tea and fill up the rest with lemonade. It takes like only lemonade. They added maybe 3 tablespoons of tea. I PAID FOR TEA AND LEMONADE. Now I have to brew tea in my own house, so this was a waste of both time AND money. Severely disappointed. Will likely not be returning."

We go back, unload everything, only to discover that they had given us barely ~20 coffee cups. We immediately go back and request more. The cashier says each traveler only comes with 12 cups. If we wanted more, we would have to buy them. I insist they barely gave us any for 4 travelers. The cashier relents and hands me some more cups. However, the on duty manager, MOLLY, hears about this and is furious. She calls me to the back and insists with anger that she gave us a whole sleeve of 40 cups and we don't deserve anymore. She demands the cups back and when I say no, she roughly grabs the cups out of my hand and says we need to go back and count how many cups we have.I politely let her know that at bare minimum, each traveler should come with 12 cups since each is 96 fl oz (8 fl oz x 12 cups = 96 fl oz), what their website states and also what the cashier says. MOLLY is indignant and says the policy at this store is 10 cups each. I notice that she clearly has a power complex and always needs to be right so try a different tactic. I let her know that besides it being very embarrassing to make a scene about a few cups, it's also a sanitation violation that these opened cups were touched by me, grabbed by her, and now put back out into circulation. She says this is none of my business and there is no way she's giving them back.

I asked why you're not giving me a table but the other people he replied oh I made a mistake what you will do now if you don't like the service you can leave. I was pissed because I love their food but the attitude this person has is very working. Even the server was saying I was there first but he didn't listen and let other people take the table made me waiting. Later he pointed to a table and said when that table will be empty I will give it to you or else you can LEVAE. This was so disrespectful I do not deserve to be treated like that especially when I'm not in faults."

710,AvpB-RQgEW9N4Eip3l3cww,8/27/2022,3 star rating,"The overall set up of the restaurant is interesting. The entrance is almost blocked off so you can't just walk in. I ate in once and realized the service wasn't worth it. I've had just about everything. My go to is the chicken kabob platter with fatouch salad, hummus and the laffa bread. Previously they'd put olive oil and paprika/chill on top of the olive oil (although personally I just prefer olive oil). This time it came with a pepper purée that made like a pocket of water on top of the hummus. Chicken tastes like a light shish tawook flavor. Reminds me of bbqs with my family. The fatouch normally has way more romaine but this time around it was mostly shredded carrots. I'll always eat here as my top middle eastern pick closest to my grandmas cooking but recently it's been inconsistent."

I had to ask, OK so when do you open, the woman tells me in half an hour...We take a walk, come back in half an hour, and then try to order a shawarma platter. That's not ready for another 30 minutes...At this point, we are hangry. We ordered the laffa with sausage and Falafel. The Falafel tasty but not crispy. The sausage was really good. The fresh baked laffa was also really good.I wanted to come here because Yelp had some really nice outdoor photos but that area was closed. They have good food but not worth the trouble. I'd do take out next time."

The sandwich was crunchy and the avocado was one of the best I've had! Monday's they have margaritas for $8 (Smokey, classic, and spicy). They also have hot green tea (sake, lemon, honey) toddy. It was great but the food was better. Will definitely come back here if I'm in town again!"
714,K6x7wyqA2iOBjWIhMvOBVQ,6/11/2022,5 star rating,This is a great brunch spot in the dumbo area! It is reasonably priced with a wide variety of menu options. It was easy to get a reservation for 4 people on a Saturday morning. All of the food was delicious and portions were generous.
715,K6x7wyqA2iOBjWIhMvOBVQ,11/2/2021,3 star rating,"Meh! The food was ""homemade and fresh"", but seasoning and spirit was off. I ordered the crispy truffle fries with grated parm and parsley ($8) as well as the bowl of turkey chili ($8). Both were just okay. There is nothing wrong with the food here, but nothing super extraordinary either to justify the price point. I suspect this is one of those places where people eat at just to eat at for lunch or dinner when one is in the area. Apparently, the salad is supposed to be what is good here."

717,K6x7wyqA2iOBjWIhMvOBVQ,4/11/2021,3 star rating,"This place gets top marks for the way they've organized things during COVID-19. Arrows on the ground to denote one way foot traffic routes, QR codes for the menu, temperature checks, waiters wear disposable gloves when serving food, outdoor seating is spacious with cozy heaters. Severs are always super nice.However, the food here has always been hit or miss with me (even before pandemic times). The ingredients always taste super fresh but seasoning (at least for the vegan/vegetarian items) is always off. Most recently, I got the California Benedict ($15). The avocado was perfectly ripe, hashbrowns were satisfyingly crispy, eggs were poached just right but it was all so bland, there was no flavor or seasoning not even saltiness. On the other hand, the salad that came with it had too much dressing on it  (too sour). On top of that, the broccoli with tofu seasonal market vegetable side dish we got was really flavorful but overly salty.Previously I've gotten the brussel sprouts (disappointingly mushy), seared marinated tofu (comes in giant slices where the outside with the sauce is tasty - maybe even too salty, but the marinade doesn't penetrate to the inside and it is too bland), and the quinoa artichoke burger (I would skip this - it's not flavorful at all)."
718,K6x7wyqA2iOBjWIhMvOBVQ,1/16/2023,5 star rating,"This is a comfortable and moderately priced restaurant with a great menu including comfort food and healthy options. Service is very good. The atmosphere is very nice. The location is great. When I first went there during the pandemic about a year ago, their outdoor space was terrific. Last night I don't think they were using the outdoor space (it's very cold right now). But indoors was quite comfortable too. I had a teriyaki salmon dish with market vegetables. My companion had the steak. We both loved our meals."
719,K6x7wyqA2iOBjWIhMvOBVQ,3/9/2022,3 star rating,I was skeptical about this place cause the menu seemed super casual. I came on a Thursday evening and was pleasantly surprised by the legit restaurant atmosphere. They still have up barriers between tables to be covid friendly. We didn't have any drinks and stuck with food. I got the steak and frites. I requested the steak medium well and it came medium rare. I sent it back and just asked for no pink this for round and it was still very pink. They're clearly not great at cook to order in this regard but the flavor was good and the fries were crisp. My friend got the steak sandwich and enjoyed it as well. Wouldn't return but would tell others to give it a go.
720,K6x7wyqA2iOBjWIhMvOBVQ,11/25/2020,4 star rating,"Mmm delicious place to go for lunch in the Dumbo area! The food and service was great. I really enjoyed the Buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. The chicken was tender and flavorful. I also enjoyed the Kale salad which had a delicious dressing, and had the option to have a protein added for extra cost. You've also got to try the Yuca fries! There was both indoor and outdoor seating when we ate there, and they adhere to all the necessary healthy precautions."

Why?! Why would anyone put sugar on walnuts in a salad? Yak.  Unhealthy and unnecessary.  The kale salad was cut into very small pieces.  Cheap kale, not dark green organic one that can be cut into larger pieces so your fork does not slip.  And the whole salad has tons on cheese.  Arugula salad was better - no sugar, no dry fruits which are bad for you.Rice:Flavorless and overcooked white mushy goop.  Guys you should cook rice al dente! Ice tea: It was pretty dark and bitter, not fresh. It had no flavor.  Brussels:Greasy, overcooked mush.  Overall, the food is unhealthy because too much dressing, too overcooked, and no flavor.  It looks like it is all trucked in and precooked.The staff:Super nice! Space:Outdoor patio - Nice We would never return here."

It was founded by Pasquale ""Patsy"" Lancieri: an immigrant from Melfi, Italy. According to local lore, Lancieri learned the pizza trade by working at Lombardi's Coal Oven Pizza (America's oldest pizzeria, circa 1905) on Spring Street. In the 1930s, approximately 89,000 Italian immigrants lived in low quality tenements all over Manhattan's East Harlem neighborhood. Patsy and his wife Carmella also lived there and opened a pastry shop on 1st Avenue. Later they wanted to bring traditional, coal-oven pizza to their fellow immigrants, so they sold the pastry business and opened up a pizzeria next door. The pizzeria became very popular with the local Italian clientele and soon became a hangout for celebrities such as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Tony Bennett as well as New York Yankees Phil Rizzutto, Joe DiMaggio and Yogi Berra. According to local lore, Patsy's was the first New York pizzeria to sell pizza by the slice. Patsy passed away in 1974 and Carmella took over the business. Patsy also trained his nephew Pasquale ""Patsy"" Grimaldi. He opened his own pizzeria (also called ""Patsy's"") under the Brooklyn Bridge in 1990; the name was changed to ""Grimaldi's"" in 1996. Carmella sold the pizzeria to longtime employee Frank Brija in 1991. Brija franchised the business and opened 11 additional locations throughout New York. I recently visited Patsy's for the first time while I was on a cycling trip in NYC. I was cycling through Harlem in the early evening, and when my eyes caught Patsy's I thought, ""I can go for some pizza!"" The interior was decorated with framed photos of various celebrities who dined there over the years. The dining room definitely reminded me of the iconic scene from ""The Godfather"" (1972) when Michael Corleone shoots Sollozzo and McCluskey inside an Italian restaurant. According to local lore, the pizzeria was actually the inspiration for the scene. After looking over the menu, I decided to go classic and ordered the Pizza Margherita. I was so excited when they brought the pie to my table. The crust was crunchy with a nice amount of char around the edges, the sauce was a little sweet, the fresh mozzarella had a nice pull, and the basil tasted so fresh! This was excellent pizza!

My NY family lives near this Queens pub, my cousin had his first beer here, and we went here recently after a sad family gathering. We ordered every comforting deep-fried thing on the menu, drank beers, told stories, laughed and maybe cried a bit. The bar itself is overly brightly lit in my opinion, but the food was surprisingly good and inexpensive and everyone remembered my family and was so sweet. We'll all be back again and again."

(For the express version, skip to the veal dish) Let me break it down. We got seated pretty quickly as it was about 5:45pm & empty. To start, we ordered 3 cups of ice with a splash of ginger ale & lemons. (Served in wine glasses or something similar-2 sips & it was gone)Appetizers:Fried Mozzarella; AKA-Grilled cheese with mozzarella, fried & served with sauce. It didn't taste bad, however, it came out luke warm so we weren't impressed. The sauce was sweet, not bad.Meatballs: 6 mini meatballs which were actually microwaved longer than the grilled cheese & very tasty. Definitely enjoyed those!Entrees:Chicken Special: Fried & breaded chicken breast stuffed with ham & cheese in a brown sauce (similar to marsala) with truffle oil. It was good, but a small portion.Spaghetti Carbonara: Really tasty. No complaints.Veal Cordon Bleu: Wish I knew what it tasted like, but the server brought it to the table next to us so he could try it before me. The older gentleman (who had a beard) hovered over the dish, looked at it, put his hands on it & then they realized it was the wrong dish. The server removed it from the table & walked straight over to bring it in front of me as it was my turn to try it, but I refused.As a server with 8 year experience...you could've at least played it off & brought it in the kitchen then back to me even though I'd know what's up! Sooo...definitely gross & ruined the experience for all 3 of us. Wish I had better things to say as we had higher expectations. Will not be back, but was worth the try! To give some credit, they didn't charge for the drinks or the dish, but i returned it & refused a 2nd one anyway."

Along with the orders they included bread, parm cheese, plastic utensils. Great Job on the presentation of the food even though its take out, It made me hungrier to look at.

772,AvpB-RQgEW9N4Eip3l3cww,6/7/2018,3 star rating,"Hidden along Fresh Pond Road is Antica Trattoria, an Italian restaurant that truly caters to the locals and seems to be taken for granted by them.Walking off the M train, it's a quick two block walk to a not so welcoming entrance. At first glance it looks far too casual to be a legitimate restaurant but it actually is! Walking past the cashier, you see dining tables set up with very modest décor that tries its best to whisk you away to Italia while still being in Ridgewood. I came here with my boyfriend and his family for his mother's birthday. We made a reservation for 6:30pm for 7 people and not all of us showed up on time but my first impression of customer service was great as they were patient and seated us regardless whether the whole party was here. However, the restaurant is fairly small with no more than 8-9 tables total so it wouldn't of been a problem to begin with. It was also fairly quiet and not very crowded.As we started off with drinks, the customer service began to taper off throughout our meal and wasn't as strong as it was when we initially came in. They had some wine and soft drinks though I can't recall if they have anything more than that. The menu itself was divided into fish, chicken, meat, salad pasta and appetizer sections with a lot of seemingly endless pasta options! Someone in our party insisted on ordered calamari and something else that pleasantly surprised me: a fried, grilled cheese sandwich with mozzarella and tomato sauce. The initial appearance did not look appetizing at all but it tasted amazing!! Think of this as the cooler, young cousin of the mozzarella stick. It was surprising they had such a fun item on their menu given the initial look of the menu itself and location of the restaurant which, to my knowledge, isn't an area known for restaurants that have fun foods on their menus. This was honestly delicious and loved by the entire table.For mains, most people leaned towards pasta, shrimp and pizza. However those who wanted pizza that night were out of luck as the oven was not working. It was not the end of the world but given the amount of options on the menu it took some people a moment to think of Plan B. Some people were boring and had one slab of veal on their plate - or was it the restaurant who chose to keep it a little too simple? - and I was basic and had penne alla vodka which was honestly the sweetest vodka sauce I had in awhile; it was different that most of the sauces I had ever tasted. Meanwhile, the boyfriend had the gamberoni scampi: jumbo shrimp sliced in half with garlic in a lemon and white wine sauce. The presentation looked nice and it tasted nice and light but it wasn't worth the $20 price tag. To be fair though everything else on the menu was reasonably priced.Towards the end we all looked at the dessert menu and I was happy to see all the desserts across the board were listed as $5 each (actually, they're $6 each - fix that menu, Antica!).  Since it was his mother's birthday, was insisted on a cake with a candle (she hates making a scene out of her birthday) but little did we know this restaurant actually busts out a whole theatrical performance! When the cake was ready, suddenly the lights dimmed, color lights flashed and music blasted and a few servers sang happy birthday. My boyfriend's mom was mortified but the rest of us were blown away; kind of like when one of your quietest friends decides to get loud and jump on top of a table - you just don't expect it!Overall, this was place had a couple of nice surprises, the food was good but not great and the service was just okay. I'm almost never here but if someone wanted Italian in the Ridgewood area, I'd tell them to check out Antica if they wanted to."

The person on the phone confirmed the reservation and said it would be no issue. Upon arriving, they informed us the indoor seating would have to be split between multiple tables. We were forced to sit outside in 90° weather and the service was a disaster. We wanted to do the 90 minute bottomless brunch, however, you have to arrive by 2:30 pm to order this option. This should be mentioned on the website. The food came out at different times; some people waited over an hour to get one drink. Everyone in the party was extremely disappointed. Some traveled from New Jersey based on our recommendation that we made. Disaster!!"
774,_-89MKTICre2Gj6Mq-qhDA,10/5/2020,4 star rating,"One of the newer bars opening in the area. Cool exterior and plenty of seating available on a Saturday afternoon. Brunch menu consists of an all-you-can-drink option that includes the entree. Didn't really want to start boozing to that extent, so settled on the Chicken & Waffles ($16) to go along with the Ocean Colada ($12). Colada comes out first, not overly sweet, moderately boozy, plus surprisingly drinkable. Food comes out a bit after - one giant waffle with four chicken tenders placed on top. Waffle is dry, helped by the syrup that was pre-poured over. Chicken meat is tender, but the breading is soft from the syrup. Overall fine flavor, just wish the syrup was something I could have added on after.Service here is fantastic as a few different waiters came by to check up on us. Would have liked the full menu to be available, though plenty of interesting options for brunch."

It's a bit small in size but definitely big on impact. Had the feels of a major city styled bar but mixed with the upswing of a lounge that, on the right occasion, has the potential of giving out club like vibes.Though, it can appear to be busy, the attentive staff makes the stay that much more enjoyable.Hopefully with the summer approaching, the outdoor seating will be just as cool as the interior."

I also had the drink called ""The Entanglement"" it was good but a little sweet.  I got the larger size in which it came in a reusable cup. Will definitely return. The vibes and decor was very nice. Element of Dive/ under sea theme. They sell hookah separate and play mainly hispanic music. Full bar so they are able to make whatever drink you want. Spacious and still offer outdoor seating if you aren't dress to their discretion."
779,_-89MKTICre2Gj6Mq-qhDA,10/9/2022,1 star rating,"This place has potential if it weren't for the extremely rude staff. An establishment can have the ""ambiance"" but if the staff has an attitude problem, make you feel like you're bothering them when you've literally just arrived, or make you feel like they're doing YOU a favor, then I will for sure go somewhere else. I really have never seen such poor customer service at an establishment like I did at this one. I've had a terrible experience, not once, but actually TWICE. The only reason I went the second time was to give it another chance and because some of my friends were there already only (they work in the area so it was convenient for everyone). The first time we went, the servers were very rude and just overall made us feel uncomfortable. The second time, some server named SONIA with the cheap-looking highlights very rudely asked us where we were going when we started walking upstairs where our friends already had a table. She refused to let us join them. Then when we were deciding on where to go to next, she again with all the attitude in the world, told us to move because we were in the way. SMH, I've never been treated so poorly and with so much attitude. I'm Latina and I know about the ""latina attitude thing"" but that definitely needs to be placed in check because you (the owner) will for sure lose business because of all that attitude problem you are staffing. You definitely lost me and my friends as a customer (they go there often because of work and now won't go there anymore) and we love to party/spend money. Plenty of places in NY, which means a lot of competition. Step it up. The bouncer was nice at least."

781,_-89MKTICre2Gj6Mq-qhDA,5/31/2021,2 star rating,"Two stars because our second experience ended so negatively. I brought people here bc the first time was fun for a friends bday party. **This is a busy and fun place to turn up but be prepared to have low expectations.To be fair, Wendy our hookah server was the sweetest and the host ( I didn't catch her name) was accommodating and professional. Unfortunately....-Its overpriced. The price of our shots could have gotten us a bottle. Instead we paid nearly $300  for 17 shots of Hennessy (a little under 3 rounds) which is even more than what we would pay for even in the city. Who could have expected that price?!! Not their job to predict us needing a bottle but a suggestion would have been appreciated upon the second or third round and we could have gotten more for our money which was frustrating. -Hookah set up is a rip off. Last time i was here our coals were refilled. Our $32 dollar hookah died in 45 min, and when we asked for new coals (which is very normal everywhere I've been hookah lounge or not) An unfriendly woman running the hookah area told us we have to buy a $20 refill which is clearly them taking advantage and trying to make more money off us. Understanding this is an establishment rule and not the staffs doing, i asked the server for clarification. Shelistened to me but I could tell she got irritated when she said that they don't refill coals bc ""they are a bar, not a hookah lounge"" -__-  obviously you're a bar /restaurant but you sell hookah , so what's the real reason? The real reason is your establishment wants to up charge your customers.  We ordered a new refill & it fizzled immediately,so we had to ask for a replacement.Finally we get our $480 bill, and the server impatiently told us she can only split 3 cards. We asked why and she said she was too busy to run more, then rudely explained she was doing us a favor bc normally it's only two. I understand this logic but it might be helpful to explain that when you drop the check instead getting irritated with us as though we should know. I've worked in service for 10+ years and the customer is bound to not like everything 100% of the time, but the job of the employee us to act like you want them to be happy. All this is fine bc none of us will be coming back, what started out as a promising experience fizzled out just like the hookah refill. Disappointing!!"

The vegan meat balls as well as the empanada were my favorite and the fries from the steak frites were good. The steak was a little dry for mine and my partners liking and the fried shrimp was okay. They also had someone offer hookah which they state is not part of them and we quickly said yes not realizing but that was not the greatest either."

When we sat down we immediately smelled the wings and they smelled phenomenal. We both ordered them and they were some of the best I've had in a long time. I live in the UES and I'm still coping with the closing of Bar Coastal & Rathbones, this place might be the new go to for wings. They were perfectly spicy, they weren't fatty at all, they were also perfectly crispy. We really enjoyed them. This bar also gave me Gangs of New York vibes with the huge American flag and older school decor. Will definitely be back here again. Also they have comically large urinals in the men's bathroom"

It's a lovely bar inside and has an interesting history which includes being the pub that Lisa Kudrow works at on Mad About You. Friendly folks as well which makes it a must stop for a drink while in Union Square.

The original owner still owns it, and as usual if your in the neighborhood its the perfect place to grab a bagel with butter or cream cheese or any other spread you might enjoy. Nutella??? Because, yes they have nutella!!!They have a large selection of bagels to choose from, and they are all made fresh in the back. Parking can be a bit intense but then again its located in the heart of 86th street bensonhurst and the parking ticket cops are watching your car like hawks. Bagels are soft and fresh and the owner is super friendly.It is my go to bagel spot when I'm in the area!Its small inside there are no chairs to sit, its more so of a take your bagel to go type of place."
814,Kh0-HmlgmVUkRxR55_Vn1g,10/3/2016,4 star rating,"My idea of a perfect bagel is one that is slightly stale on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Basically, I shouldn't see any loose crumbs falling out as I'm eating it. The bagel that I got here fits these criteria pretty well! Pair it with their cream cheese and you've got yourself one filling bagel for lunch for less than $3! They also sell rainbow bagels here for $2. I've seen these at other places and I would say that the ones here are more aesthetically pleasing. I've been walking past this place every day for years now and it never crossed my mind to make a pit stop since the outside looks kind of dingy. Lesson of the day: do not judge a book by its cover :) This place is a gem."

We stopped by at this small bagel shop, no seats -- you just order and go. we order 2 coffees, a bacon egg and cheese on a roll and some eggs and bacon  n the side.

817,Kh0-HmlgmVUkRxR55_Vn1g,6/4/2016,5 star rating,"Mom & Pop shops all over are being shut down because of the takeover of corporations and franchises. Those bagels you get at the deli or Dunkin Donuts are nowhere near the league of a water bagel. The way water bagels are made is using the technique of boiling the dough before baking. Those you get a Dunkin or other locations are par baked bagels. They are mass manufactured, baked halfway, get delivered to the location it is being sold, and get baked the rest of the way. So when they tell you it's hot out of the oven, they are technically not lying.During the morning breakfast rush, expect the line to be out the door. During the morning breakfast rush, you have a higher probability of getting a bagel literally fresh out of the oven because they sell so quickly at times they don't make them fast enough.Years ago, some friends introduced me to whitefish salad. This is one of the few bagel shops that has whitefish salad as one of their spreads. So when I want to splurge, that is what I get as whitefish salad is a bit pricey. One of the benefits here is they have a sandwich card readers program. Read carefully. SANDWICH rewards, NOT bagels rewards. You get a stamp for each sandwich you buy. After you collect 10 stamps (buy 10 sandwiches), you earn a free sandwich. I was going to give it four stars because of the wait times waiting in line but the staff is really nice and very accommodating when I have them cater for work. Yes, they cater! Be smart and courteous and order in advanced. Don't go in the day of and expect them to just hand you over 100 bagels."
818,Kh0-HmlgmVUkRxR55_Vn1g,2/2/2018,5 star rating,"Bagel Bazaar is a dying breed of bagel stores in Brooklyn. The racial demographic of Brooklyn and especially the 86th street strip is saturated with many many many asian owned restaurant and bakeries so I understand the frustration that someone who isn't asian might feel when they're trying to get breakfast aka bec bagel, or bagel with cc or butter/ jelly and a cup of coffee.  Asian food is great but sometimes a girl just really wants a bagel smeared with cream cheese with a few slices of tomato added into the mix and this is exactly what I ordered today when I went to Bagel Bazaar. They make the bagels fresh on premises which to me is the creme de la creme. You're getting a FRESH bagel. The moment I bit into the everything cream cheese bagel, it was love at first bite. The bread inside the bagel was so soft and bouncy and the outside of the bagel was a solid crunch. The price can't be beat either. Since they make their bagels in house, the price of a bagel w/ cream cheese is significantly more affordable than if you'd go to your corner deli. I've got to come back and try more of their bagels next time I decided to take this route to work. Don't ever close Bagel Bazaar. You are a gem in Brooklyn. -Yours truly,  a Brooklyn Chinese Girl."

It's right next to the train so it's very convenient- I just pop right in and out. It goes without saying that the bagels are amazing! I have to be on the train by 5:30 am and when I get there I can always see the people in the back working hard to make the day's batch. Some of the staff work so impressively quickly even so early in the morning which is a godsend when I'm in a rush. Wish I could recall the gentleman's name who usually helps me, but despite the number of customers that come in and out he knows my ""usual"" and confirms that's what I want soon as I step in."

Bought a dozen bagel + 1free for a office breakfast party and I asked the guy to toast one of the bagels in the bag and put cream cheese for me to go so I can have it on my commute to the city. I didn't mind paying extra. The guy told me no and that I had to pay for another bagel...when I already have 13 bagels in the bag. I don't understand why I need an extra bagel if I already bought a dozen from you. It's 6:00am, I'm starting my 12 hour shift and you couldn't even toast one bagel for me? You just cut a bagel in half and pop it in the toaster- it takes less than a minute. Even a child can do that (maybe).He also assumed I didn't have enough cash.

We decided to order the lunch special and some meat to share. The meat needs to be cooked on our own so its not done by the waiter/waitress.  Service: The service is average/good, but wish they give more water. It did take a while for them to switch out the plate when we were barbecuing, so we were using the same plate which made the meat more burnt.Food: I got the Roast Beef Gyu-Don Set that comes with Miso Soup, Lunch Salad, Edamame, and of course the Gyu-don. Be aware that the Roast Beef Gyu-don that my friend and I had was cold so we ended up putting it int he grill ourselves. I think it suppose to be cold, but not really sure. Overall it was still good and a nice place to have a bonding meal with friends and family.Overall: I will come back here if I ever want some japanese BBQ.

The workers were just all huddled up on one table; just chatting and not attending other tables. Food wasn't anything special; quality of meat was lower than usual.When going to pay the bill, they didn't even come back until 10 mins later to retrieve it. Don't want to get paid? I am honestly super disappointed from this experience. Wouldn't come back to this location again.Update: I got sick a day after dining here. Got the stomach virus and fell sick."

However, the back is pretty spacious and the tables are far enough that you have privacy gobbling down on your meats. This was my first time having japanese bbq and everything was delicious. We go the meat lovers special and all of the meat was really well marinated that I didn't need any of the sauces. The servers were so attentive in answering questions and changing the grills constantly. I also loved how crispy the karage and how savory the mushrooms I got were.

We went as a party of two and were seated right after having our vaccination cards checked. Maybe because we were two people or because there was a snowstorm outside. We went for the meat lovers course ($85). Since it was happy hour, we also got side plates, including the gyu-sushi (2.5/5) and spicy shrimp (4.5/5). The sushi was essentially two pieces of roast beef and rice. There was nothing super fancy or special about it. Meanwhile, I loved the spicy shrimp. It was pretty spicy, but the spice level was SOOO on par with my taste. But best of all, we got the harami in secret pot, which is a must-get for me every single time. We did most of the cooking, well I personally didn't! But, the server did switch the plate several times during our meal. We enjoyed our meal and were glad we didn't order more!

844,zuxZtAredHPR1wrx12g1ng,8/2/2020,3 star rating,"Came here on a Sunday around noon for brunch. I was pretty excited based on the menu, options for bottomless (mimosas, sangria, Mary's), and th e price point. We (accidentally) sat ourselves on the huge outdoor patio with a waterfall and plenty of potted plants. There's plenty of umbrellas to provide shade and a fan or two but it was still pretty hot. We had to ask a couple times for the menu possibly bc we sat ourselves but we passed plenty of employees otw to our table who didn't offer to help so we thought that was how it worked. Anyway we started with mimosas which were pretty week so we eventually switched to sangria which they kept saying they were running out of but they kept bringing it to other tables. We also wanted the steak and eggs but they were out of steak so I went with the San Salvador and my compatriot got the pancakes. The San Salvador was borderline terrible. The Pupisa was under done, not must flavor outside the hollandaise, salad was warm, but the potatoes were salvageable with hot sauce. The pancakes were pretty good and come with 4. All in all the food is by no means a draw and is $18 per plate but the bottomless is only $14 (or maybe vice versed) so if you go with the sangria it's pretty worth it and the ambiance is nice. All in all I'd only return for the cheap drinks and socially distanced patio but otherwise go somewhere else. Also it is CASH ONLY and restroom leaves much to be desired."

I was thankful to find an establishment that could accommodate such a large party during Covid. For a party of 18 Prepayment was an requirement; however informed manager overall we would have a party of 25. The kitchen and manger had more than enough ample time to prepare for such a large table. I thought wrong , the customer service was horrible. My waiter was very forgetful , constantly using the excuse he was servicing 3 other tables. Clearly he was struggling and couldn't keep up. I requested to Speak with the manager because at this point my patience were running low. The manager never arrived in which I took matters into my own hands. Let's just say the manager was money hungry and showed a lack of concern ; probably because the bill was already paid for. He used the excuse we are busy , told him he's reasoning was unacceptable. Business one /one don't host a large party when you are not equipped to handle the demand. But when ordeals of such occur ; the answer is clear management is money hungry. He promised that the service would get better in which it didn't. Just a lousy ass sorry was provided. We paid for 2 hrs of unlimited mimosa , sangria , and constantly had to chase the waiter down for refills. Was informed refills are every 10 minutes , but at one point my party waited over 30 minutes. Outside was extremely hot and obtaining water or even ice was pulling teeth. Only one fan outside was working , which was extremely ridiculous . If you offer outside dinning fix the necessities to ensure your guest enjoy dinning experience. Guest ordered additional items off the menu , and when time to receive payment the waiter was constantly hawking us to pay the bill. Where was this energy during our dinning experience. Very upset he received a tip, he didn't deserve it. Don't celebrate a big event here because it will be ruined. Don't pay in advance , because zero fucks will be given regarding poor customer service. Piquant you were dead wrong yesterday , Yelp family you have been warned."

Bad week calls for bottomless brunch? Piquant. However, in the recent 1 year it's declined. Especially on holidays, don't even bother coming for brunch.The last two visits consisted of waiting 35 minutes for water or a waiter. That day was particularly frustrating because it was a hot summer day in the patio where we were dehydrated. The most recent visit consisted of 4 guests in my party ordering the signature piquant burger and all 4 people having GI upset for the next 2 days. I called the same day (Labor Day) and a manager was supposed to get back to us and never did. Major waste of $300 and health problems to follow that affected our ability to go to work the following day. This has been common service for quite some time now and it's disappointing. There goes Piquant. One of the only last brunch spots of its kind in Brooklyn. I guess this is what happens when the yuppies move to Brooklyn and bum rush piquant and woodland on weekends."

The service is terrible, I understand these people's career goal probably isn't to work at a fast food chain, but seriously, be at least semi professional, you ARE getting paid for it. It's really not a hard job at all and there are qualified people in need of jobs that would do it 100x better than the workers here. Just keep in mind you'll be waiting FOREVER for one or two simple things off the menu.Last and worst of all, the food is REALLY stale and dry all the time, the sodas are flat and the hot drinks taste like they were watered down with piss (who knows, eh?).It's fast food, not a 5 star restaurant, clearly, so how high can expectations be? But, if all you want is some cold soda, freshly fried chicken, and hot fries, your better off going to any OTHER fast food place around here, there's literally a bunch... Walk around the corner, or go 3 blocks down to the MD on Snyder ave and save yourself from this terrible place."

One time I had to literally leave because I couldn't take it anymore, and that was halfway into the line. Can you imagine? To make things worse, the bathrooms are always clogged up. The management is obviously careless. It looks nice on the outside, but it's hell on the inside.The employees are also rude sometimes. Hey! It's not my fault you had a bad day. Stop trying to charge me 25 cents for a small barbecue sauce packet. I can't believe it.Two stars because when there's no lines, the food is quickly served and the breakfast is okay."

859,cKGi-erQrad9lf87VH6cjA,6/17/2022,2 star rating,"UNFRIENDLY TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIESFor a place with a family friendly menu and a large outdoor space, boy do they not want children here!I preface this by saying that I am an elementary school teacher and a parent and, as such, I am a firm believer that no-kid policies are both appropriate and warranted - no-one wants to spend their night out listening to someone's rambunctious children carry on. That said, on a rainy weekday, my 5 year old daughter and I were invited to join some family at Greenwood Park. We arrived around 5pm. Due to the weather, there were only 4 tables of customers in the covered outdoor area and a few patrons inside the bar, the rest of the place was vacant. We ordered food, and although several menu items were unavailable, we mostly enjoyed what we ate. After eating, I took the children to check out a large boulder in the completely vacant outdoor space while the rest of the adults at our table had some drinks. The hostess promptly followed to tell me the children could not climb on the rock. Understandable, this could be a safety hazard, even with a parent attending. Instead, the children wanted to walk around the yard to see the wall art. The hostess returned to tell me the children could not walk around the outdoor space. Strange, they were quiet and well behaved, but okay. We returned to our table, which was next to a large indoor planter. The children had two small toys and began pretending the toys were walking around the rim of the planter. The hostess approached and told us the children could not touch the planter. They sat down and picked up a few pieces of gravel to examine - the hostess said they could not touch the gravel.We left.  We will not be back.While I can COMPLETELY understand why you wouldn't want unruly children - or even well behaved children - running around while people try to enjoy their food and drinks, preventing children from calmly  walking around an empty yard while accompanied by a guardian makes it clear you do not want the business of families. Thankfully, there are many other businesses in Park Slope who do! I suggest patrons with children opt for one of these establishments instead of Greenwood Park!"

861,cKGi-erQrad9lf87VH6cjA,4/19/2022,1 star rating,"So this place has strict rules about kids... unless they belong to the owners (or maybe manager? Although I would guess owner).  We went and 3 kids around 8 years old we're running around, sitting at various tables and brushing into people.  At one point, one of them almost RAN straight into a woman walking with a pitcher of beer, and she did not look thrilled.  One of them was standing and crouching on a hi top chair, shoes on the seat.  It was particularly off putting that they were allowed to do this in an establishment with such a low tolerance for customers' kids.The food... meh.  Nachos were gross and soggy.  Yuck. Nothing was great.The service... pretty below par- we've come a few times, and it always seems like the staff is super nice but brand new.  That's kind of a red flag.  It's slow, drinks don't often come and servers don't check in often.  My meal was wrong, and although I usually just wouldn't say anything, it was done exactly the way I asked for it not to be, so I let the server know.  He said they'd make a new one - by the time everyone was pretty much done and we were getting ready to go, it still wasn't out and he said we could cancel it.  The check came, and we were asked if we wanted to have it wrapped up to go and we said no thank you.  The reason for the offer I'm guessing was because they didn't take it off the check, which we had to then point out.Overall, could have been so so so so much better.  I just don't think this place is run very well, and the hypocrisy in the policy re kids rubs me way the wrong way (I would have found kids behaving like that in a restaurant very annoying anyway)."

A woman who worked there (either a host or manager) was so rude that I was embarrassed I had recommended this spot... we were scolded numerous times - nearly everything our kids did resulted in a reminder of some rule. It seems their new policy is to enforce so many unrealistic rules on children to discourage families from coming. Guess it worked because we will not return and definitely will not recommend it to any of our friends.Side note -- the waitress we had could not have been more gracious and friendly, but the treatment by the host/manager was enough to make us never go back."

Staff were wearing masks. After taking our order, our waiter basically disappeared for most of the time. Nobody caring to see if our order and good were good. I had the burger and it it was pretty much as I expected- just OK. The fries were pretty good. The entertainment was watching actual rats chase each other. These were nice big, juicy rats, too- not the kind you mistake for mice. The insult came when presented with the check and was charged extra for cheese on the burger when the menu clearly states it's included. I didn't bother arguing. I figure if they don't bother keeping rats out of the place there wasn't going to be much caring for something that is deliberately entered in their system."

I'm glad we decided to dine in, because I really enjoyed the vibe of the place. We got fries, tteokbokki, and some wings. The tteokbokki was spicier than I thought it would be, but still delicious and served on a burner to keep it warm. It came with fish cakes and an egg as well. We originally wanted their crispy spicy wings, but were told they were out of that batter which was a bummer but the original spicy was still tasty especially with the soy garlic sauce.The staff were quick to take our order and check in on us periodically.

Was dying to try their burger as soon as I saw they had opened near my office. Lucky for me, they were on MealPal!I got their cheeseburger with fries. Had to wait a little bit, but that was because they were making it to order when I got there (instead of having it sit around, which I appreciate).It's just a very well constructed and balanced veggie burger. Sure, it falls apart halfway through, but it has great texture and is filling.But the star of the show are the fries! I usually hate crinkle cut fries (especially Shake Shack's), but Lekka's are the best I've ever had! Crispy, salty, delicious!"

I had the Guacamole Burger and the Broccolini Caesar Salad, both of which were really flavorful and clearly made with fresh ingredients. One slightly weird thing was that only upon asking did I learn they use two different burger patties, one made with black beans, and one with white beans. For some reason, this isn't mentioned on the in-store menu at all. The gentleman at the counter seemed a little surprised and somewhat pained to answer when I asked about the patties (if they use the same type for all burgers, or if there are different types). From another review here, I'm wondering if he was dreading that I didn't know it was a vegan place. I later noticed he was being trained at the bar area, so maybe he was just new. Anyway, he was still nice, and the answer was that two burgers (the guac and another one) come standard with a black bean-based patty, and the rest come with the other type. I really don't get why this isn't clearer (maybe they don't want people swapping them around or being hesitant about beans?). It would just be nice to know more about what I'm eating, especially for folks who may have a preference between the two. All in all, a great vegan burger option."

Staff is nice and friendly. We shared the messy fries, guacamole burger, masala burger, and a matcha milkshake. We really enjoyed the fries and how all the sauces played well together. The burgers were tasty, particularly the masala one, and the milkshake had a nice creamy texture. Overall, we enjoyed our meal and experience.

The tea was pretty sweet but I usually opt for 25% sugar so I'd have to see if the sweetness can be adjusted to accurately judge in the future.We had the boba milk tea and brown sugar. Drinks were creamy and tasty. Only complaint is that they don't seem to have larger sizes, so you're still paying a lot for small cups. I suppose price wise it's on par with other boba spots in New York but in general, holistically, it is expensive for the small cup.

912,Q02uPdw8j8yDIVSPyJATjA,6/14/2019,4 star rating,My friend bought us a 6 inch carrot cake from Lloyd's. And for less than $13. I took a slice on the airplane and it was really good. Plump raisins and greet frosting. The cake was moist and i loved the flavor.The location is tiny. Not much customer service but you really don't need it since you probably know you either want a carrot cake or red velvet cake. Would have it again!

The cake is as delicious as the rest of the reviews before me. It is moist and delicious. The frosting is a bit sweet but I was never a frosting type of girl. It's so reasonably priced, it's practically free lol. Nuts and raisins are optional for the carrot cake!The space is super small, literally a hole in the wall. No decor, it's a bit dingy inside. Follow the scent and it'll lead you inside. Customer service is extremely lacking. The lady up front is SO rude. Such a shame considering the potential it can have if customer service improved!"

915,Q02uPdw8j8yDIVSPyJATjA,6/6/2021,4 star rating,"3.5. I had hoped to order a cake for my partner on Uber eats, but for whatever reason it was down the week I needed it. I decided to call instead and reserve a cake, but the woman on the phone told me that wouldn't be necessary for a carrot cake. I stopped by in the mid afternoon on a Friday. I waited a few minutes while another customer was being served. When it was my turn I ordered my 6 inch carrot cake and saw the employee pluck one from a large stack on the (non refrigerated) wall. The box was pretty mangled, torn on one side, but I didn't want to be picky and paid for it anyway. It was less than $15 which is insanely cheap for NYC cakes. I was a bit concerned when I walked away and my cake was sliding around in the box, sounding very dry. When I got it home, I discovered the frosting was completely dry and crumbly. Maybe this is how it is supposed to be, but it was off putting. Made me feel like the cake had been sitting out for a day or two. The cake part was very good. Not sure if it was ""the best"" as many articles claim, but it was very good. Not too sweet actual cake and then pretty sweet frosting. My partner didn't think it was enough frosting - he prefers cakes with a middle layer. I popped the leftover in the fridge and the frosting did soften up by the next day which made it better. Not sure if I'll be back, but the price point is so good I probably will."
916,Q02uPdw8j8yDIVSPyJATjA,7/3/2022,3 star rating,"Confession: For me, cakes are more about the frosting than about the cakes themselves. Consider this a review for the fellow frosting aficionados out there. Lloyd's Carrot Cake is a fine specimen of cake, but there is a single layer of thin frosting on top. I would prefer it with two layers of thick frosting that has a stronger cream cheese tang to offset some of the sweetness of the confectioners sugar. For people who are less frosting-oriented than I am, this might be your perfect carrot cake."

The security staff has no regard for their customers safety despite having multiple bouncers. They had kicked out 2 parties that began a physical altercation in the bar which led to full grown MEN fighting women for no reason. My friend was walking in front of this bar, leaving, and got decked out unprovoked and assaulted. Yet the security staff would not even have the decency to call the police or assist while not ONE but FOUR women were innocent and getting physically assaulted by multiple grown ass men.

It's in the same vein as Hair of the Dog and 13th Step, but the drinks aren't really as good. Go if you want--or don't--it's nothing revolutionary."

925,leYx3XTNEDLn9ezoXjlA5g,9/20/2019,3 star rating,"One and One is sort of a hybrid of a sports bar and a college bar.  The food isn't anything special, but I'm glad they serve food.  The drinks are priced relatively well and they have some good specialty drinks.The thing that makes it so inconsistent is the service.  No one had been rude necessarily, but the bartenders aren't always the most attentive.  It also tends to get really packed on Saturdays during college football season, to the point where you can't even move on the top floor.  Waiting 15 minutes for a drink is never fun.The basement area is set up for drinking games and has TV's.  Usually co-ed sports teams go down there to play games after their sports.  The area is fine (a little grimy, but to be expected for LES) but I wish One and One did a better job of reserving the downstairs for the sports leagues it partners with.The other thing that would help them more is if they utilized the downstairs bar.  I have no idea why it sits empty.Overall, One and One is an okay place.  I have had really fun times there but also frustrating times when it's too packed and service is slow."

Okay, now that I got that off my chest, back to the review. One and One wasn't what I expected. After scrolling through some review I was under the impression that this was an upscale place that didn't allow baseball caps, nothing less than skin tight jeans, and you couldn't gain admission without a Patagonia vests. However, I was dead wrong. This place offers a great sports bar atmosphere and you're allowed to dress in Eagle green during the game. I'm not sure if the above attire is mandatory during the work week. Guess I'll have to check it out? Also, the bar was filled with frat stars and tridelt ladies. Although I'm normally not one to frat [fret] about these people, it was a little over powering. Beer wasn't cheap. For game time pitchers were $15 and we didn't dare check out the food options. Couldn't imagine the price. How about some specials during the games? Now onto the spacing. The bar isn't large by any means necessary. We didn't go downstairs where I heard there is more space with beer pong. The upstairs was PACKED by the time kickoff came about. Literally, packed in like sardines! The place was 100% over capacity and there wasn't a bouncer or door guy/gal to control it. This made it very difficult to snag a pitcher. In short, I don't think we'll be headed back due to the prices. However, it was a great time throughout the game! GO BIRDS."

Daughter and I shared the falafel trio which came with a huge pita, three different salads, hummus, pickles, tahini and a green spicy sauce (don't know the name) for $14.  Also got a side of the cauliflower for $6.Loved trying out the different falafels - one was particularly spicy. The salads were fresh and consisted of a purple cabbage, a tomato/cucumber mix and a type of coleslaw. The deep fried cauliflower came topped with drizzled tahini and lightly spiced. So delicious! We unfortunately couldn't finish it but as I'm sitting in JFK now, would pay anything to have this again. What a find! Highly recommend."

I love their falafel trio platter--the spicy red pepper falafel definitely has a nice kick (although I may prefer the other two types just a tad more...). The falafel is freshly fried and delicious, the pita bread is also super fresh, and the cabbage salads/israeli salads that are included are very refreshing and healthy. The schug is really good and goes well with the falafel, and the hummus is super smooth and light! The platter is definitely a great serving size and can be shared (or if you're alone, it's still great as leftovers). I also love their cauliflower. Honestly, no complaints--the food is delicious and the staff are friendly. Would like to try their halva sometime!"

The bartender was really nice and made a point of checking in on me periodically without being obnoxious. The beer prices and selection were good, and I had a nice relaxing time. it's a totally chill, attitude-free joint, from my experience.

But next to us was a drunk couple of women who were practically on the verge of passing out. They were loud and rowdy just looking for someone to listen to them. I can't speak about the alcohol since we ordered just one beer each. It was fine. After a bit we got used to the noise.The best part about this is that it's open till 4 am!

After a nice walk on the highline we exited at 20th Street to get to our quaint destination. We ordered eight crab and pork dumplings and eight pork dumplings. Then we foolishly ordered the cumin lamb entree to share thinking we might still be hungry. It was a Friday after work and we both had to cheers to the weekend with a Tsing Tao beer .

When my burly friend said he was too full to finish she said ""Look at me, I eat this every day, you have room to finish it"".   It was very funny.Overall, I'd say the food is between a 3-4 star rating but I loved our waitress so that pushes it to 4 stars."

The only negative things is the selection of ""performers"", if you want to call them something. Between a few professional djs, and a few are friend of mine, the rest is just a bunch of kids or wannabes with no musical ethics whatsoever. They give themselves a bunch of weird names to look trendy but most of the time the music is pathetically horrible. Just a bunch of hipsters playing djs. With a professional (or at least somebody that knows what he/she's doing) program director, someone with a musical resume a little older than a couple of weeks, able to create a daily showcase that actually make sense, this place could be the bomb, a real exposure for music professionals and talents, a place that does what is supposed to do in the first place: be a independent platform for entertainment, expression and education."

974,hPJ7x8rfSsJ4ObgHeAK5kg,11/19/2018,3 star rating,"This review is probably inaccurate because most people wouldn't go to bars at 4 PM on a Saturday...but my BF and I needed a place to chill at before heading to dinner so we found this place. Dim grungy interior with lights laced along the wall like in Stranger Things, bathroom with no mirrors and heavy graffiti, and a dirty darts table in the back--it was interesting seeing the ingredients to a hot messy Saturday night at a bar without the crowd or the noise. The bartender is respectful and nice, no nonsense. We got the shot + beer for $8 and it is what it is. Your typical NY bar, always reliable, which I've come to appreciate after seeing the lack of such in other cities."

979,hPJ7x8rfSsJ4ObgHeAK5kg,7/1/2018,5 star rating,"An American Treasure! This is the newest iteration of the East Village classic. The night I visited was everything you would want from an East Village dive bar night--strange people, juke box picks from Bowie to Van Halen to who-knows-what. And then we have a bartender who was merry and sultry and served up drinks with aplomb. She's a keeper!The barkeep and servers rocked on, even in the face off--or despite--having to tell, European party of drinkers after another, that, yes, it's not only customary to tip American barkeeps, but it's also the way said barkeeps actually get paid. It's always been this way in tourist-heavy NYC, but in the East Village, the memos take a while--or decades--that tipping bartenders, and tipping them well, is the ticket to a nice evening of merry-marking America style. At the International Bar, it turns out, it's an essential part of their mission to spread the gospel of tipping. I put down a fiver just to cover a couple of Italian fellas who feigned ignorance! It's just a small gesture to support this legendary spot."

The place is definitely divey but it extends a bit in the back, so my friends and I were able to get seats in a little back room to ourselves. There are also seats outside. In the room that we were sitting in, you can play video games like Pac Man. The service wasn't the greatest. I definitely prefer the Clockwork Bar for dive bars, although this place has comparable prices."

Sounds rad, but so is the newest iteration of the space. Despite name and space changes, this place remains one of the best spots to take an occasional dive. Friendly as hell doorman, cool patio (now until 10pm), and a rad Irish lady bartender. Yes, all this on top of stiff pours at a good price. Sounds like much hasn't changed.."

Instead of announcing what the desserts are - Friendly service all around.

How life has changed during Covid.  We decided to support our locals places at least twice a week with ""to go"" before restaurants started  coming back to normal again.  Nancy's was on our list.A great place previously, but now in the new world we fell in love with our locals all over again.  The food is great, the staff is amazing.  Liz is amazing!!!Honestly can't wait to have a sit down meal here again!"

987,jYjJNB9qlmd6dbYZBaDjfw,9/10/2020,5 star rating,The food really is so good. I always get risotto and one of their salads with grilled shrimp. Portions are huge and everything still tastes great the next day. My husband loves their burger with sautéed onions and pepper jack cheese. We usually do takeout and we really appreciate how the food is packed up. Everything is always very neatly packed away and their French fries come in an open box that way they stay crispy and don't get soggy. I've never seen another restaurant actually care that much about takeout. Always keeps us coming back! Either Vicky or Liz usually answers the phone whenever we call and they are both so polite and always get the order correct. During Covid they'll even offer to bring the food out to your car for curbside!
988,jYjJNB9qlmd6dbYZBaDjfw,7/8/2019,4 star rating,"We've been here twice on Friday nights, and we love the live music they have. We sit in the bar area at the high tables, right near the fireplace and in sight of the musician- super cozy vibe. You can tell the bartender knows nearly everyone who walked in which shows theres a decent amount of regulars. We like the food, but both times I went somehow couldn't find much to choose from.. David's gnocchi was good but I wasn't crazy about the sauce/maybe not a big fan of pork shoulder- however, the next time we went I believe they had a special gnocchi and I preferred that taste. They have valet parking fyi! Wish they had a happy hour (their website isn't updated// don't see anything else on yelp so assuming they don't)."
989,jYjJNB9qlmd6dbYZBaDjfw,9/26/2016,3 star rating,"Saturday night Bonnie G. and I trekked to Floral Park to finally try Nancy's Restaurant. We had scanned all the reviews and what photos there were and were expecting a bit more than we actually found there. It looks like a neighborhood bar and restaurant and once inside its confirmed...Big bar and moderate sized adjoining dining room with good activity. Noise level was over the top due to no wall coverings to absorb sound. Really hard to converse across table. We had seen photos of several dishes we were looking forward to trying, but we found that they change the menu at their whim. Not terrible but we did want to try the Pork Belly et. al....Also we saw photos of really tempting Turnovers but they discontinued them and subbed hard rolls.The food we ordered was good! Onion Soup was rich and cheesy..we enjoyed it!Quesadilla was actually 1/2 as it was one large shell filled with cheese and meat and folded in half. Needed more filling. Their Nancy's Special Salad with Burrata was fresh and delicious...particularily the ripe tomatoes and the Mozzarella!.For Mains BG ordered the Sizzling Hangar Steak and I had the Pork Chop. Presentation was good and meat was prepared perfectly but the entre's dont come with their fresh vegetables...they are all sides. We were surprised after seeing all the photos of farm fresh produce on their Yelp photos but aside from the salad none were apparent?? Service was very good and servers were cordial. After spending time at the venue we would not return with guests as its too loud and with the paper table cloths not to fancy. It really gives the impression of a local bar as previously stated but the food is really good."

The food is good, but we have found it to be consistently too salty for our tastes. Next time we will remember to ask if the chef can cut down on the amount of salt in each dish."

Well let's just say I am an IDIOT. The food was amazing. I started off with the best French Onion soup I have EVER (see my pic) had and I've tasted some of the best soups. Then I had the Gnocchi w braised Pork shoulder for my entree. The pasta was fresh, the pork shoulder fell apart ever so gently and tasted amazing... Now one of my fave dishes to date. We followed it off w a half order of lightly fried Apple fritters w ice cream and whipped cream... let's just say I was in ""food heaven"" for a few hours. Oh and to top it off we had the pleasure of eating our meal while chatting it up with the beautiful and fun Vicky !!!"

Love that they expanded the wine selection too. I wish I could convince my husband to order it more often. It's a little pricy but so delicious. The kebab bowl and mushroom hummus are still my favorites."

I get the feeling that a lot of people come here for the ambience (think mommy hipster). Given the current state of things, and to be honest I haven't been here since quarantine started, I feel bad leaving a negative review but if people are going to treat themselves to a nice takeout meal, maybe skip this one.Shakshuka was sad and disappointing when I came in.  The bread seemed stale. The food wasn't seasoned properly. The hummus was okay, so I guess they live up to the name."

First time I had their brunch the potato pancake with labneh and tabouleh, I like it a lot but it's not available to order all the time. Hummus is good, not the best I've had but decent. Recently ordered the chicken shawarma for delivery. It's good but so oily, the oil was literally dripping out the bottom of the pita. Good amount of meat, wish they balanced with more veggies."

The hummus was well made and the bread that they had was very good. It looked like a pita but it was more like bread.There wasnt much meat in the meal so they seemed like they were skimping but the taste was there.The price was the only negative and it was $15. That is expensive for take out lunch but the flavor was good.  Might come try some other items.

It was my sister's bthday and she is a foodie , so I decided to surprise her with a food that she's never tried. We started with coffee. I ordered Turkish coffee and she had a stumptown coffee, both were good! Then we ordered regular and green shakshuka . And her bf got shakshuka with merguez sausage ( it came with hot pita bread and a small salad) I don't know what to say: it was sooo delicious, portions are not too big, perfect size. Our waitress( didn't catch her name, sorry) was very friendly and professional . Thank you !We will be back !"
999,DI5A-3PzqAHqh5ynp8yebw,8/27/2022,1 star rating,"Ordered a shakshuka, explicitly asked if they can make the eggs soft, sure no problem was the response. When my order came the eggs were very hard, and I mean VERY Hard, which wasn't even what triggered me to write the review.. it was the response of the ""chef"" who allegedly said he wasn't capable of cooking softer eggs. This is so absurd to me, how can a restaurant hire a chef who doesn't know how to cook eggs in a shakshuka, one of their main entrees. On top of that we were the only customers there at one point and it took an astounding 40 minutes for the food to even come out. Finally, the chef messed up my husband's order and gave him a wrap instead of the bowl he requested. I must say the host was very gracious and did try to remedy the situation, but unfortunately the pleasantries of the host couldn't compensate for the lack of professionalism and apparently lack of ""capabilities"" of the chef."
1000,DI5A-3PzqAHqh5ynp8yebw,1/10/2019,4 star rating,"We ordered delivery and I think this just became one of my favorite hummus joints! It took an hour but was worth the wait.Every side was fresh and delicious. The beets are cut ultra fine with little bits of red onion thrown in. The cauliflower was not overcooked, still a little firm. Their carrots come with a generous amount of feta. And their quinoa, which I never like, was very flavorful. I think the quinoa is their version of a Mediterranean salad, as it had all the standard ingredients like red onions and cucumber, chopped small and mixed in.The spiced mushroom hummus is not spiced as in ""hot"", just nicely seasoned. It's drizzled with a good bit of oil, more than I see at other places and I wonder if this is also why I loved it so much. The mushrooms chunks were cut just right (not slivers, not chunks too big to chew), and were served in the right proportion to the hummus so you don't have to worry about running out of shrooms while you still have hummus ;)"
1001,DI5A-3PzqAHqh5ynp8yebw,12/22/2018,5 star rating,"Yum. Had brunch here with some friends on a late morning and enjoyed the middle eastern eggs. It's basically their version of eggs Benedict, but vegetarian and wayyy better than any eggs Benedict I've ever had. Two poached eggs and chunky tomatoes with tzadziki served over a couple lengthy pieces of sourdough is not a mistake. There's also feta sprinkled all over the top and around the plate. Just do it okay? Tea, coffee, or juice included! And all this for only $10, I meannnn.Also the folks who work here are super nice and accommodating. I've enjoyed the hummus at a party before, and I do not think I've had better hummus in my life. Thank you Mimi's!"

Shakshooka was delicious.  Someone mentioned they don't add seasoning and I noticed that but I don't like a lot of season, it had the perfect amount for me.  Pita bread was fresh, hot, and really good.  Some zatar though would give it a lil kick.Also had ice coffee, Turkish coffee, and punchims.  Ice coffee is stumptown and I'm a fan - good coffee.  Turkish coffee was weak though but had a decebt taste but not enough kick.  Lastly punchims, which are like chocolate truffles rolled in crushed pastacios, were good but I could have lived without them.  Lastly, service was on point.  It's a small place however Waitress was helpful and kind. I will come back to try dinner."
1003,DI5A-3PzqAHqh5ynp8yebw,9/28/2020,1 star rating,"I used to come here a lot before the pandemic. The food was ok, for the most part. They converted to a grocery store during the pandemic-the items were pricey, kind of sloppily displayed, but did a job in a pinch. As the mask mandate kicked in I started to notice that every time I came in, even as the employees were wearing masks, the owners were not, putting the employees and community in danger. Sad to have to cut off support to a local business during these times, but the owners have made it clear they don't care about the community they're part of, and therefore don't deserve support."

Lots of wood. Wooden tables, seating, a lovely well decorated large scale wooden book case. There is much on the menu to choose from, it took me a while to decide. I ended up ordering Breakfast plate #1. I also tried the Guava iced-tea lemonade to go with it.  The first thing to arrive at my table was the Guava drink. I wasn't thrilled at first sip but my taste buds seemed to have a change of heart after the next few sips with the food that came after. I found myself absolutely loving this drink! The more I drank the more this flavor made me feel as if I were somewhere relaxing on a tropical beach (contained no alcohol btw). There is just something about the flavor. So they brought the breakfast platter out to my table and It was a big plate, filled with goods (scrambled eggs, pancakes, bacon and salad). It looked great and it tasted even better. I was very pleased. The atmosphere was nice. Incoming customers decent. They have outlets by the tables for convenient device charging. I actually really enjoyed eating at this place. It was a pleasant experience and I definitely want to come back here again to try another one of their drinks. The only downfall--the bathroom door from the inside (spray painted with graffiti). [Paint the door you guys!] Otherwise, great! ;)"

1023,FvCslLyo0SlDKI52bEDekQ,8/26/2020,5 star rating,Ordered pickup from Caffe Bene via UberEats on my way back home from doing errands. I've been to Caffe Bene locations before and remembered them having a fun drink menu and my memory served me right! I spent so long on the app looking through their menu because of how many choices they have! My pickup was ready upon arrival and the employee handed me my bag through a small hole in the clear screen at the counter separating the employees and the staff. My food was fresh and they even kept my drink in the freezer so it'd stay cool! The cashier asked me if I wanted to have the drink now and helped me unpack the wrap on top of the drink so I could enjoy it on my walk home. The staff here are very thoughtful and their coffee always hits the spot! I had the honey bread this time and it wasn't my favorite but amazing regardless. Please try their cheesecake though cause omfg. Worth a visit for sure!

The curry fish balls came out first very quickly but we weren't a fan of them. The dumplings were ok and we didn't expect them boiled since we saw fried ones reviewed here so it would have been nice if they asked us how we wanted them. The garlic shrimp was pretty good and very flavorful but the best was the beef chow fun, though there seemed to be way more bean sprouts than noodles, which was disappointing. The bubble milk tea was surprisingly good as well as was the lemon honey drink, though it was $4 and quite pricey."

It seems most of their business is delivery. Menu is primarily mock meat and Asian fusion dishes like tofu teriyaki, and a variety of plant based protein/rice/vegetable dishes. They also have a selection of vegan treats. Prices are very reasonable, and all credit cards are accepted.My friend and I each got a lunch special, which for $6.50 each was an incredible value. For this price I received a large portion of sesame ""chicken"", rice, steamed veggies, and hot and sour soup. The soup was not very good-too much salt, and not enough flavor. The mock chicken and veggies were very tasty. I also tried the mock duck and chicken nugget appetizers which were excellent. Highly recommended for vegans and omnivores alike-you really won't know the difference!"

The soy protein options are delicious and I always order their veggie spring rolls. The first time we ate in the restaurant which is not too bad. The staff there are really friendly and was very patient with me while I decided what to order.The next two times were delivery. Seamless, grub hub and Uber eats all say they don't deliver to my location but after calling them directly, they came for a small delivery tip of $4.00 (same as those apps).The food is very well portioned, I always have leftovers. I also appreciated the fact that the food was hot each time it was delivered which meant the delivery person did not delay. I wish the pricing didn't go up after lunch time each day but it's still not too bad considering the size. I will def be eating from here again and recommend it to any vegan!"
1037,wurhcLKXD4YJ5XfTxpbE5Q,6/15/2019,4 star rating,"-Hot and sour soup: mushroom, bean sprouts and tofu in a gooey/gelatiney broth. Seems like a thickening agent was added to simple broth to give that consistency. Mild ""sour"" flavor, not spicy (if that was what was meant by hot). Not sure if this is how hot and sour soup is supposed to be but I didn't care for this at all, mostly due to the consistency of the broth.- general lunch special comment: if you like the hot and sour soup or the spring roll then it's a good deal for the price. I dont care for either so it's not worth it for me-Eggplant soy chicken: okay. Comes tossed in the ""classic"" Chinese food take-out oily brown sauce (though a little less oily); if that's what you are going for then you'd like but it's not my thing hence my rating of just okay.- 2 scoop soy ice cream (butter pecan): was hesitant to get delivered as I was worried it would melt but many others on seamless didn't complain so gave it a whirl. Good texture, not really dense (like Haagen dazs for example) but not half air like store-brand ice cream.  Flavor was pretty good and the size was good for $4. Would recommend."

Their lunch special is a great option if you're in the area!***I was super excited to come here. Can't say I'm disappointed because I only had three things and they weren't horrible, but just alright. I got miso soup which had way too much seaweed, too firm tofu, and no scallion. Also, a strong miso flavor- not the mild soup I'm used to. The general tsos chicken LOOKED extremely impressive. It tasted pretty good too. The sauce was a bit on the watery side but I really appreciated the taste of the mock chicken. To top it all off I got a smoothie, which was good! I wish they added ice though lol. Overall, id come here again to try out some other stuff. My next feat is their chicken nuggets!"

The sauce wasn't bad.  I'm no stranger to soy products.  The soy was overcooked and it was so hard to chew.  It really ruined the experience.  I wanted to like this place but the meal just fell short.  I relayed my experience to the individual who suggested Zen and they told me that they had the same feeling about the orange chicken.  She assured me that if I return, I will be pleased with something else like the mango chicken.  Not sure that I will go back but i will keep her tip in mind if I do."

When my partner lived just a few minutes walk away, Knickerbocker was our go-to bagel place. If you walk in on a Saturday or Sunday the line is usually approaching the door and you will wait about 10-20 minutes to get your order and leave... BUT it is absolutely worth it. Loads of bagel options as well as cream cheese spreads. Bagels are nice and chewy with a good amount of seasoning. They also have some tempting looking desserts, which on occasion I've tried 1 or 2 and they were good. We're not so close anymore but we recently ordered delivery and it was just as good as always. Ordered the turkey avocado club which has plenty of meat. Also got a scallion lox bagel with bacon; it was equally satisfying! When I'm in Bushwick, Knickerbocker Bagel is my preferred bagel spot."

Coffee had sugar after I said no sugar and my bagel had regular cream cheese not vegan and it had way too much. I tried to call to have this corrected but no one picked up. $15 down the drain. This is exactly why people order from seamless and grub hub at least I would have been able to get money back. So disappointing after a long wait online. Horrible customer service.

We started sharing the Mashed Avocado & Veggie Sambusas. Both delicious, but having had the delivery sambusas many times, nothing prepared me for having them hot and fresh. Crispy dough, perfect crunch, amazingly seasoned veggies?? Huge favorite, should have gotten two orders. For dinner we shared the Ras Kitfo, Mushroom Tibs, & Mercato Platter, choosing injera as our starch. Rare moment for me to have no particular highlight in an entree, because it was ALL delicious. Finished up with an Ethiopian coffee & sharing the Coconut Leche cake. No picture of that, as we dug into it too fast, but the light sweetness of the cake really brightened after the bitter, strong coffee. Anyway, really enjoyed our time here, looking forward to visiting again. **special non-food mention to hail up their Flatware & Glasses...

All components were great; I especially loved the Key Sir and the Gomen. And I'll always go for an extra order of Injera. The colors of the food were so vibrant, but all you'll see in my photos is the calm, dark, chill atmosphere of the space. Such a great dining experience. Thank you, Ras."

He was such a gentle and amazing soul. He came up as if he was just hanging and asked ""how was it"" and we got all detailed and talking him into going in and trying it and he blushed and said ""Thanks, hope to see you back soon"".

According to the check, I was their second order. Btw, I made the order ahead of time online. For food I ordered the medium drumsticks and wings combo, half soy half spicy sauce and the parmesan fries. With tax, service fee and tip, it cost me $47. For that price, I would think it better be good, especially when I've had Mad for Chicken before, except different branch. Starting with the chicken... they're tiny in size which I can sorta understand but definitely not worth the price. It was nice that they separated the two sauces with a parchment but tbh, there was no need for it. The level of spice on those wings were close to mild if you can even consider it that. The two sauces tasted pretty much the exact same. The fries were okay, there wasn't enough parmesan so flavors weren't consistent. I will take partial blame for not shaking it up, maybe that would've made it more balanced.I probably won't be ordering delivery for wings. If you were to eat, should probably just dine in as I would."

It was funny how we had to keep on changing our flavors because they were out.We got a order of the kimchi bulgogi quesadilla and 10 wings. The food was overall yummy and I do recommend it. The quesadilla was alright. Nothing out of this world. I think they could have added more kimchi. The wings were good as well!

We walked down Grand Street to the restaurant, asked for a table, and received a lovely 4-top right by the windows. First, Yelp check-in to get a round of free lychee soju shots. Complimentary popcorn was served, and swiftly devoured. After brief deliberation, I ordered large wings, sticks and thighs, half and half. (If it's your first time and you want the classic experience, this is what you want.)After munching through a basket of sweet potato fries, the wings showed up. Seeing those big, juicy pieces of chicken stacked on the plate made me so happy. Eating them just made me happier. When only bones remained, I cleaned my sticky fingers, then rinsed my mouth with a pint of IPA. It felt good to be back. Next time, I'm hoping to stay a little longer, maybe try something new from the menu. I'd forgotten how much I like this place. Can't wait to return."

I ordered a small order of wings (10) with two flavors, soy garlic and spicy soy garlic. The wings were perfectly coated with sauce and provided a satisfying crunch with every bite. The uniformity of the wings was a noteworthy observation; every wing looked the same!Given the cooking process, it may take a bit of time for the wings to come out, but you can grab a few appetizers to curb your hunger while you wait. I would definitely come back!"

We were seated immediately and our waiter recommended the half and half wings (half soy garlic and half spicy soy garlic) so we ordered that along with Parmesan truffle fries and spicy dumplings. The fries were amazing and crispy and came with spicy mayo that was better than any I've ever had before. The dumplings were coated in a spicy sauce/glaze (you can also get mild) and were crunchy and delicious. The wings were also coated in delicious sauce and were crispy and well cooked. They even give you a little bucket to discard your chicken bones which is a nice little detail. We came during happy hour so drinks were cheaper. We had the lychee soju cocktail and the mule and they were really good and strong. Everything was sooo good and I can't stop thinking about it. Don't hesitate, just go!"

With all the fees, gratuity and such it was about the same price as dining in. The flavor is the same as when you go in person! I noticed the pieces are a bit smaller than they used to be, but they are still as flavorful and crisp as ever! The rice is well steamed, traditional rice.... I wish I had some steamed bok choy or funghi toss over it. I'm so glad I have the ""Madness"" within reach!"

NEVER again i'm i going in there. It's nothing but a bunch of hungry thieves working in there who are used to swiping peoples card.

Many calories as well is making the journey with me but who cares cause the moment I get back to the office my useless workers will come alive with joy . The place inside is limited space wise so order and go on your way and other thing I must mention , this place bangs you out wallet wise as I got 60 bucks less in my wallet after ordering all the yummy goodies .Really like the pretzels from Annie's but I like to keep it simple and always order the plain kind  and the mini nuggets are also my favorite but I can't go overboard today but tomorrow is a different story if I am in the area again .

Basically shooing us away and telling him to deal with us. He was at least nice telling us that the wait was going to be 15min. Eh, if this was a sit down place, you know we won't return.

She yelled at me and said ""Cinnabites"" or something like that aggressively twice and condescendingly like I was stupid for not knowing the name but the tag for the cinnabites was obscured behind a safety sticker. She was so rude and acting so tough that I didn't mention the label wasn't visible and didn't ask her name. She looked 30-40 years old, brown-skinned androgynous black lady. The guy who came to the counter instead of yelling at me from the back was very friendly and not aggressive like that lady.

So I applaud the brioche but the gruyere was less prominent than I hoped. The price tag of the smallish orange juice is by no means an outlier at $4.75, as the average diner probably charges more than a 64-ounce grocery container, but I found less sweet and more grapefruit-y than expected.

As NY starts to open, most everyone was sitting outside for Sunday brunch. Nearly every table was taken and we needed to wait to be seated. Though they were overwhelmed, the staff were patient, helpful and totally pleasant. A nice start. The street is quiet and so sitting on the sidewalk we could still enjoy a conversation while enjoying our meal. The food here is just fantastic. The French toast is perhaps the best I've ever eaten. The eggs are superb. We decided not to choose a dessert. And as busy as they were, we never felt rushed or cramped. This is not a restaurant that needs publicity, but still, it was a wonderful brunch experience. The biggest challenge is that it is a small restaurant with a loyal clientele and you often have to wait to snag a table. But it's worth it!"

1129,VNBo_iJ9-WTenIZpl8Ix-w,1/29/2022,4 star rating,"During the summer, we visited La Parisienne in Financial District for brunch. It was easy to find, as it was very popular, and saw many people dining or waiting for a table.They had tempting looking baked goods on the counter. We got Almond Croissant, Financier, and Canelé. Almond Croissant was tall and buttery. As for Financier, I thought it was a Madeleine...therefore, it was surprising to get the full almond flavor. It was not as soft as I wanted, but moist and sweet. Canelé had kind of tough exterior, which was unexpected. Blast of caramel flavor.With that much baked goods, we didn't feel the need to order two separate brunch dishes, so we ordered Croque Madam to share. We added a side of mixed greens.Croque Madam was cheesy goodness. The ham was thicker than some other ones we had, nice and meaty! The egg was cooked just right. It was filling and satisfying.Since it was such a nice brunch, we thought why not end it with some coffee and dessert? So, we ordered Cappuccino and Paris-Brest. The size of Paris-Brest was much bigger than expected, which was great. It had loads of cream filling! The cream was more solid than ""cream"" which made it easier to cut and eat. It was an excellent dessert!We had a nice, relaxing brunch here. The staff never rushed us, even though it was a popular spot. We enjoyed everything we ordered, and we were happy and full. Definitely a place we want to go back to in a future."

I had the ham and cheese croissant and it was enjoyable; the croissant was very crispy and a bit chewy, but I prefer my bread on the crusty side so it was fine by me; the béchamel sauce added some nice je ne sais quoi (ok, no more french in this review...promise).  My wife isn't a big eater early in the morning so she opted for the yogurt and granola and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I also ordered an apple chausson which was good if not exceptional; in hindsight the croissant was enough for a full breakfast.  Our coffee drinks (a latte and a drip decaf) were enjoyable.  The staff was very gracious and we sat near the door so I can attest they truly are welcoming and friendly with everyone that comes in.  Overall this is nice little cafe with some character down in the Financial District, so definitely check it out if you want a little Parisian flavor in your NYC day."

My boyfriend and I came here for brunch on our anniversary. I got a salmon brioche breakfast and he got a French toast. Yum to all the bread baked here. The egg yolk was perfect, not so runny that your hands get sticky but runny enough that you get that beautiful texture as you eat it. Smoked salmon was delicious and the fresh dill really brightened it up. The French toast was warm, had fresh fruit, and was doused in syrup, which I was worried about at first but it actually wasn't too sweet, which was a pleasant surprise ^^.Latte and wine were both excellent as well. We sat outdoors in the fall but the internal decor is charming, too.I highly recommend this place!"

Classic mixed drinks like vodka cranberries are only $5 which is amazing for the area. I tried a few other bars before coming here and there wasn't a drink under $14, so that was nice. It's an LGBTQ+ spot too, so a great choice for good music. My one critique is that they didn't accept credit cards? I'm not sure if this is a usual thing, but I believe it is. We had to get money out of a generic ATM which just seemed odd to me that they didn't take card in the first place. Yet, I will likely stop back in the next time I am in the city."

This time they had live music w an amazing singer, which was awesome! Had the same bartender both times... James? Jason?... tall, skinny, super funny. He played the best music, my friends & I ended up staying there all night. I did not expect that, it's a total dive bar, no frills, needs a good deep cleaning! Not for the upscale lounger seeker. They could definitely start with a better alcohol selection! Please, guys? Still a great Mon / Wed spot!"

Everything from booking a table, to selecting our meal choices, to finishing the night with dessert was perfection. The interior is super quaint, with a romantic ambiance and a nice outdoor patio in the back. Now to the food. WOW. The flavors were unparalleled. So much more taste than the many other Mediterranean spots in the neighborhood. We ended up ordering two small plates of the labneh, spicy feta, grilled eggplant, 700 degree cabbage and three taboon breads (to die for). The whole fish was cooked to perfection. Salty, crispy, fresh, flavorful. And the semolina labneh lemon cake was the icing on top. A neighborhood gem. (I ate the food too fast and only snapped a picture of the fish)"

They do something so magical with the spices that make this a unique Mediterranean dining experience. The wine is also very lovely.  I have been there many times and it's so consistently excellent.  Beautiful service and ambience."

We loved each and every dish - falafel, 700 cabbage, eggplant carpaccio (my personal favorite) and chicken mousakhan. I also had Persian lemonade to drink, which was a bit too strong and sweet to my taste, but generally very good. The service was quick and efficient, we left full and happy."
1148,2roGBLPFp4X0sgmWuFEEBQ,9/22/2021,4 star rating,"I am giving 4 stars for the whole meal, but the Moroccan fish entree was 5 stars hands down. We started with the hummus, falafel and cauliflower. The bread it came with was good, but a bit too oily and salty. The hummus was enjoyable, the falafel were crispy and the cauliflower was cooked perfectly. All good for sure, but nothing that really stood out compared to other places we have eaten at.However the entrees were another story. We ordered the Moroccan fish and the Kebab halabi. Both come baked in a bread dome over a ceramic dish. The dome on each was tasty, but the dough around the edges of the dish was not fully cooked.The kebab was very good, the meat was tender and the dish had nice flavors. The fish was the real star though. Extremely flavorful, perfectly cooked with just a hint of spicy. I would go back just for this dish.The service was great and they have an amazing outdoor patio at the back of the restaurant. I would certainly go back and 100% recommend the Moroccan fish."

Now, how can I eat hot cakes without syrup... I was ready to enjoy my breakfast to only find out I can only eat the eggs, sausage, hash brown and drink my coffee.... very disappointed..."

There is the occasional homeless person that wanders in here but the staff is okay at asking them to leave if they are disturbing the customers. The bathrooms are horrible. I had a gross experience in here once a number of years ago and will never even think of going back in unless I was about to pee on myself in that very moment.The food is pretty standard of what you would find at any McDonald's. I come here because I go to school nearby and am sometimes in the mood for a quick snack or just all out junk food.This place is passable but definitely nothing special. I advise to proceed with caution.

Before I could turn away I heard the manger say the just got some in and I would be served in a few minutes.Long story short the salad was terrible, service sucked, place smells like trash, crowded with school kids and bums.

I've seen him kick people out because they were loitering, but apparently you can't rest your head here for a moment. The second I put my head down for a 1 minute rest, he comes over, and says ""Miss you can't sleep here."" Hello, I pay-for the food. He's so strict and uptight about everything, even to customers that actually buy the food. Not only that, the food takes years to get to you. It's always crowded and you'd expect fast service but I waited on a burger and fries for over 20 minutes. This place is a waste of time, money, and is terrible. 0/10.

Note that this review is for the brunch menu, which our waitress said was recently introduced. We ordered the eggs benedict and frittata. The eggs benedict had potato latkes instead of the typical English muffins, which would have been fine, however they were improperly prepared. The potatoes were unappealingly gray colored and undercooked on the inside. The hollandaise sauce was also overpoweringly lemony. The waitress was really sweet and attempted to rectify the issue by replacing the dish, but the latkes remained undercooked on the inside, but now also overcooked on the outside in an attempt to correct the initial issue. The frittata was rather bland, and the asparagus were old, dry, and stiff. In conlusion, the service was friendly and ambiance good, but hopefully the culinary execution improves."

The chicken entree ($27 for chicken alone) was decent but quite overpriced, especially given the portion.Overall, we felt it was overpriced given that it wasn't very scene-y and the food was good but not a wow factor. Cocktails were about $17 which was also quite expensive without the lively scene. Felt the restaurant should either lower prices, keep prices the same and increase food quality or have it be a more see and be seen ambience to justify the price."

If only all the luck in that restaurant could help secure my spot, I would have been golden!My friend and I split the burger and chorizo omelette, both of which were pretty tasty and we got to share some fries and a bloody mary to help with that cursed above mentioned hangover.

Worthwild's menu sounded pretty good, and there was plenty of street parking nearby so we gave it a try. No complaints!We started with drinks, but since I was driving I skipped the alcohol. I ordered the Clockwork, which was delicious and crisp and refreshing. My daughter ordered the Radiant Tramp, which was heavy on the Mezcal. I guess that's not a bad thing, but not as light on the tongue as the gingery citrus  of the Clockwork. To eat, there was the trusted burger with cheese for me, with fries. It was just fine. My daughter--whose MO since childhood has been to order the fanciest thing on the menu--got the special of the day, true to form. I don't recall the name, but it was a braised lamb shank in some sort of white bean and rosemary and veggies simmer. It was beautiful and fragrant, but the flavor was not as robust as she'd hoped for. However, she asked for salt, which made for a significant improvement (sorry, Chef); and when she warmed up the leftovers at home the next day with added rosemary, it was delightful! Service was fine, but our server did forget about us a couple of times (minor requests, e.g., a spoon for the lamb dish). I'd go back if in the neighborhood."

I found the menu a little limited; however, my guess is that everything on the menu is well done. We started with the rye dumplings and the steak tartare. The rye dumpling were ok, but the table really enjoyed the tartare. We ordered two sets of the raclette burger and roast duck (and split across the table). Everyone loved the burger, including the ""pomme dauphine"" (which is best described as fluffy tatter tots). The duck was also tasty, but we all felt like it was missing something. We also wished there had been an option to get a green side dish (e.g., broccoli rabe), which would have helped round out the meal. While our dinner experience was good, I'm most interested in coming back to try their brunch."

Great addition to Chelsea! My boyfriend and I easily got an outdoor res on a Saturday night. We started with the Diablesse and Born slippy cocktails, which were both excellent. We then shared the spring pea soup with crab and mint, hamachi crudo, the cheeseburger - the fries were so good - and almond cake with rhubarb. Everything was super tasty and service was very good. They split each dish for us, which is always nice. 4.5 stars."
1174,roT-M9epcHDOGjYgGmWpoA,5/24/2014,2 star rating,"I'd heard good things about this place so I was especially disappointed when I finally went. The house specialty, Fish Lina, was a broiled steak of something, maybe cod. It was dry and bland, practically unspiced, with no more than a couple of fried green pepper strips to add interest. My sister's fish with tomato sauce was pretty much the same piece of fish with the addition of canned tomato sauce. The pork chop with mushrooms was an over-fried slab of pork with a can of mushrooms. Are you seeing a pattern here?The fried sweet plantains were good but it's pretty hard to mess those up. The rice and beans were OK, but inferior to Dyckman Express. Maybe we hit it on an off (way off) night, but I'm not too inclined to go back and try this place again."

To her husband who was holding a Starbucks cup. She was referring to Blue Bottle Coffee. This place is very ""real"" and the coffee is amazing."

1202,_GHQh87uXE3Uew-ZnTdm1A,6/28/2022,5 star rating,The smoothest espresso on the planet. I love that their sweetened drinks like the Sweet Latte is never too sweet. It's perfectly balanced.
1203,_GHQh87uXE3Uew-ZnTdm1A,8/22/2022,5 star rating,This place is great Blue Bottles Coffee!! I was on vacation with my best friend and it was right next to the hotel we were staying in. We were trying to find something great to eat and just decided to try it. We got seated right when we walked in and the service was a little slow but the place was PACKED. I would definitely come again I got the good coffee and my friend got the off of there 4 course meal for $20 menu yes I said $20. It was great definitely can't wait to come back and try something else
1204,NFE2bRE4gF8Ev70X-mV-QA,4/20/2020,4 star rating,"Every time my coworkers and I order from here, the food is always fresh!I've tried the chicken quesadillas and their tacos. Both are delicious. It comes with a variety of sauces as well. I love the chipotle sauce in particular. There's a lot of side condiments as well like onions, cilantro, radish, cucumbers, etc. I'd recommend sticking with the meats -- I had the fish tacos once and it didn't live up to my expectations. One of the downsides for this place is that they take a very long time to prepare the food and it takes awhile before you will get it. I advise you to place your order way ahead of time - give yourself at least an hour and more."
1205,NFE2bRE4gF8Ev70X-mV-QA,5/28/2022,4 star rating,The  best Mexican take out place on the island. Everything is very good. The guacamole is phenomenal. The only negative I can think of are the chips are too thick. For chips stop for a bag at Chili's. Light & thin.
1206,NFE2bRE4gF8Ev70X-mV-QA,12/7/2022,5 star rating,Always the best!!! Never disappointed in this food!! Small business and they go out of their way to accommodate you!! Love it here
1207,NFE2bRE4gF8Ev70X-mV-QA,3/12/2021,5 star rating,"Ordered here for the first time. We ordered the street corn, carne asada fries and several ground beef tacos. Everything was so good. The tacos were full of fresh veggies and plenty of beef. They were full and flavorful. The carne asada fries were tasty.. definitely will be ordering them again. The restaurant staff were very friendly and kind. My order was ready on time and was still hot by the time I got home. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. I will be ordering from here again for sure."

1209,NFE2bRE4gF8Ev70X-mV-QA,4/4/2022,5 star rating,"This is probably my my favorite food on Staten Island. The guacamole and chips are fresh and booming with flavor. Their carne asada quesadilla is mind blowing. The chipotle cream sauce is silky and smoky and the absolute best condiment for any item on their menu. Great service. Great prices. This isn't fast food. You're not gonna get it in 5 minutes, but don't give them crap... let them work their magic bc they know why they're doing."
1210,NFE2bRE4gF8Ev70X-mV-QA,10/24/2020,4 star rating,Service was amazing. The staff members that work here are extremely nice and caring. The food was average. I ordered 3 carne asada and 1 chorizo soft shelled taco. I also ordered a side of chips and guacamole and it came out to a total of around $22. I was not a fan of the carne asada. I think the steak was a little too dry and chewy. But I would come here again to try something different from the menu.

They love sharing delicious Mexican food with the neighborhood. You can taste their love and passion for Mexican food in every bite.Everything is fresh and made to order so calling ahead would be ideal. I love Cristal and Arturo and will support them for life
1213,NFE2bRE4gF8Ev70X-mV-QA,6/19/2021,5 star rating,Excellent. Why have I waited so long to try this place. Very nice people and extra delicious food. Cactus tacos are my jam and they did not disappoint. Also got veggie tacos and a veggie tostada. Going back tomorrow.

They have NO IDEA of the word customer service ! They have all types of prix fix with all  types of meat !  The specific one I like is not offered with lamb .  Seems like they have all the lamb dish but korma  . They let me order twice in the past  and today just refused to accommodate my request even at an added cost  . This is just really beyond me since I've been ordering for so long  and spend a lot of money there . Especially that most other Indian restaurant offer Lamb korma as a prix fix .  It's a shame because i really enjoyed the food  but I can't go past the point they refused to accommodate me .

I always get kale mixed up with other things. I will be sure to try something new next time.

The staff were so friendly and accommodating. The crepe was huge and so tasty. Will definitely come back here to try a savory crepe and smoothie! What a hidden gem. Definitely recommend.
1259,kTKmoQ8h5LZILeOk36x7dA,6/11/2018,5 star rating,"TL;DR Review: Delicious, high quality made to order smoothies and crepes at a reasonable price. I would definitely recommend giving them a shot.Location: 4/5Great for those hoofing it or riding a bike. Flatbush sucks for finding parking though, especially during rush hour when there no parking allowed on the street. Ambiance: 4/5Cozy spot with a couple of high chairs inside and small outside space in front of the store. Great for stopping in and soaking up some people watching whole quenching yjhour thirst with a smoothie. Quality: 5/5Tried the Power Protien Smoothie and it was delicious. Healthy and delicious. I wish my smoothies were that good. It was made to order with fresh ingredients that you can really taste.Value: 5/5A 16 oz smoothie cost under $7. A good price for the quality of the smoothie. Tons of other options too. Will be trying the crepes next time."

They have juice recipes on their menu but you can ask for them to juice basically anything (I did orange, carrot, apple, and ginger). I asked for ice in my juice, so I was given an extra little cup of juice to make up for the lack of room in my original cup! The server was incredibly kind and the juice was delicious and refreshing. Would come again!"

They use soy and almond milks, if you are dairy free. The space is small, but the wait isn't long. Compostable drink containers. There are lots of fresh ingredients on display for making crepes, so will have to try one soon."
1262,kTKmoQ8h5LZILeOk36x7dA,6/5/2019,4 star rating,"Brooklyn Crepe & Juice has an extremely impressive menu and range of offerings from crepes to juices. I especially loved all the boosters you could add to you drink. I ordered the medium kale aid because the large was intimidating (and less aesthetically pleasing, sorry I'm basic like that) but I instantly regretted not getting the large a few sips into my drink. I expected a strong leafy flavor but it tasted more lemon than anything, which is not a negative.You have to drink it at once though, once the pulp settles and warms it's kind of nasty. Even after I mixed the cup around, the flavors didn't blend together again as nicely as when I first received the drink. This juicery is by the hair salon I went to so I will definitely visit again when I'm in the area."

It's a quaint little spot with two tiny tables for outdoor dining, serving DELICIOUS crepes which are able to be customized. Their menu features both savory and sweet crepes, and you can even get them gluten free or vegan! Yayyyyyy. I ordered the ""Prospect Heights"" (which.....yo I hateeeee the way gentrifiers move into our neighborhoods and start renaming sh*t but I digress) but customized it by combining it with ingredients from the Bensonhurst. What's cute is that each of the crepe ingredients correspond to the demographic tastes of the neighborhoods they're named after, so clearly the Bensonhurst was going to be very Italiany. It is DELICIOUS. I also ordered the the mango, ginger, coconut, Vitamin C smoothie because I am Jamaican and these are a few of my favorite things lol. It's SOOOOOO GOOD. Overall, it was $24 for the smoothie and the crepe but honestly, it's filling and absolutely delicious, not to mention allergen friendly soooo money well spent as far as I'm concerned!"

When I first started coming to this spot, a15-20 min further walk from my job . . . Paradise? I mean, I don't know. The blonde-ish guy behind the counter was lovely. Is he the owner? Did he win the lottery and quit? I don't know. I never had these problems with him. Ok. ""These problems"" #trustissues #emotionaldamage, I buy 24 oz juices. That is how I roll. My eyes are aging but, I'm nearsighted. So, I go a few times and customer service leaves a lot to be desired after the angel I'm used to dealing with but, bomb smoothies. Then I go and in my rush don't realize it seems I'm carrying a 16oz container. But, I notice before I get back to work. I pour it in my 19oz mug to make sure. Yep, not 24 oz. I don't write a bad review, bomb smoothies. Ooohh. I'm bout to CRY! Fine, I send a private message and get a free drink. It takes me forever to redeem and the attitude when I get it is ""problem"" but, that's not verbalized, so fine, again. It's not my regular juice spot no more. That's ok. Who needs juice. Now, here's where a lazy foodie is crazy. I've a juice spot two blocks away. But, it's cold and I'm having a weekend (not good). Maybe I want a crepe and a smoothie to be delivered. Nope, changed my mind, just the smoothie. But, I can't trust you guys. So I MAKE A VIDEO and dang if you didn't do it to me again. Who is doing this? Who is ordering these cups? Where is quality control? I'm going to start carrying my Starbucks venti cold drink cup and embarrassing in the store. You're not an OJ or soft drink company. You can't skimp on ounces, especially when . . . I mean why are you selling 16 and 24 if that's not what you're giving? Just sell what you have. I'm at a loss. At this point I'm about to start believing in conspiracy theories, 'cause I don't get it. This is devilish, the dishonesty and why? I don't get it. I'm flumoxxed. Should I keep going just so I can catch you out there or is this a lesson that you really hate me and why would I keep spending my $ there? Is there a more logical reasoning than what I'm coming up with? I can't imagine it . . . Just, you know, LT in the West Village would never but, also these smoothies are A-mazing. I hate you guys. I've never had a ""bad"" boyfriend and I never wanted to know what that buildup of distrust and games felt like. You guys are the worst but, your smoothies are the best. What imma do now? What imma do now?? And I'm giving you 3 stars instead of 1. Have you earned 1? YES! Do your smoothies deserve 1? NEVAH!!! Sigh. I'm so upset."

1266,OS27j6CbRx7Cq6Fg8mS-KA,9/28/2021,5 star rating,"They deserve their name. Definitely one of the best pho places in Queens! I got a rib eye pho (~$12) and special # 2 with all the meat (~12) and a pork chop add-on (~4). I've only gotten take out at this location. I have ordered in person and through uber eats. If you can, you should order in person. It is almost a $4 price difference (almost $2 a dish).Take out quality - I usually do not like Pho as take out because the quality is not maintained well (soups usually cold, noodles are hard, etc,) but Pho Best III does a good job keeping the quality. The broth and beef/noodles are separated so the noodles won't get soggy. I live about a 20 minute drive from this location and the broth was still very hot! It cooks the raw beef the moment I pour it on to the noodles. Food - The broth is so flavorful. I can taste the beef base. Although it is a bit salty but that is fine for me. The noodles were a bit al dente which is how I like it. It will softens up the longer you leave it in the soup. They gave SO MUCH thin-sliced rib eye! It is so good! it had a good balance between fat and meat. The pork chop was decent. This is definitely my pho go-to spot."

Along Broadway, this shop stands out from its peers with its big windows and visiual signage. I went on Saturday evening with my partner and we are glad we went.Food: (4/5)We both ordered pho. My partner the ribeye, brisket, and tripe and I clearly got the lobster. These bowls are the size of your face and your will leave satisfied at the price and quantity. My only downside was the pickled plum soda. As a lover of ume, I was really excited. However, it was too sweet to enjoy the sourness of the plum.Service: (4/5) This is a causal place. They will not be waiting hand and foot. Feel free to flag a waiter if you need anything. I can understand why it isn't most people's speed.All in all, definitely a causal pho chain that I will visit again. Our meal was super affordable and I really enjoyed the fast service."

Bowls are big and they're generous with the ribeye.  The lobster pho is a cheap way to get lobster.  Spring rolls and calamari were pretty good, with light crispy batter, though it is a bit greasier than I'd like.  Food quality is mostly okay. Glad to have a pho option but Pho Bang literally just reopened a block away so the competition is on!   Hopefully it raises all boats here."
1269,OS27j6CbRx7Cq6Fg8mS-KA,1/23/2023,1 star rating,Worst pho restaurant in New York tbh. When they started opening I have been their regular customers. Food was great. Service is good and worth every penny to use. It has been a month that service has been bad and all these servers just want tips and the worst thing today is they served with takeout plastic bowl. A freaking plastic bowl. I am done of being regular customer.

The last time I went in the waitress asked me what I was going to tip before she even ran my card which is not ok. I was hoping that it was a one-time thing. I visited yesterday and there was a young male waiter that was actually great but when it came to getting the bill another lady brought my check and tried to show me that I need a tip which I found incredibly rude. I always tip and am in the service industry I also let her know that and she didn't care. So I tipped 1.00 under the 18% cause I was just so turned off by her service. As soon as I got up she lunged at the bill and told me I didn't tip enough and I told her very clearly "" I don't have to tip you 18% and what she did was very rude"". Never coming here again"

I left a $10 tip which was 16.66% and yet the service staff was arguing over 18% tip as minimum which is just one dollar more.

To be fair if I ate it there, it might have been different. I did take it home so the soup although it was hot was not enough to cook the ribeye. The rib eye meat was good. The brisket however tasted like it was leftovers as did the crabby patty which was hard in the corners. The best I could say about this is that it's average. And if you are really craving pho and there's nothing else around, this will satisfy the craving."
1275,OS27j6CbRx7Cq6Fg8mS-KA,12/23/2021,1 star rating,"One of my worst pho experience ever. The broth literally taste like the instant pho packages you can buy in supermarket. It's bland, and I am pretty sure they didn't add any fish sauce to the broth. Furthermore, they made me wait twenty minutes for my pho because they were short staffed, and you can tell my raw beef pho was just sitting in the kitchen the entire time because the beef was super overcooked and dried up when it got to my table.Should have followed my first instinct and went to pho bang instead."

When I arrived at the bar I asked about the two frozen drinks and the two women at the bar informed me that they were still being made and that it would take 15 or so minutes. After 25 minutes (or more) I politely asked if They were ready yet ( I was excited to try) to which one of them replies ""SWEETIE - I told you 15 minutes. It's been like 1 second hun"" in the most disrespectful tone. They sat behind the bar laughing and talking quietly and staring at me and my friend. This was during happy hour so I only got one drink 9 dollars and tipped a dollar because I was pissed about how they were treating me the entire time. I went to sit outside after paying with my drink and forgot one of my bags. I quickly remembered and ran back in to get it from the bar where I was sitting. The women wouldn't give it back to me and demanded a larger tip. After minutes of arguing with them - And them still keeping my bag hostage behind the bar I literally had to threaten to call the police. To which they gave it back immediately. They had mean girls written all over them. Felt like high school. Never coming here again."

My partner and I were bullied into tipping more than what we were comfortable with given the poor service. Manager was also incredibly rude and hostile. The drinks were watered down and average, nothing special given the price. When I tried to complain about the rudeness of the staff, I was laughed at to my face by the manager. The service was poor and unprofessional, and the atmosphere was bleak and depressing. The worst part of the experience however, was solely the staff. The owners need to hire friendlier staff or face lack of business. They should know that while tipping is encouraged, it is never required and if the staff isn't doing their job, they don't deserve a decent tip. No one is entitled to a tip, and mocking customers for not meeting your standards is not how you should be running a business."

Pinch me--I must be dreaming.This basement bar is the perfect watering hole to hit up after work. Some of the reviews describe Botanica Bar as a gross dive bar, but I disagree. It gravitates more toward a pseudo-hipster vibe: dark and industrial (with exposed brick walls, obviously) but far too clean to be divey. Hipsters have to grow up one day and become young hipster professionals in TriBeCa, I guess. Even though they might try to sneak in a cigarette between drinks and start smoking in the back room...This place starts getting packed after 7 p.m. on a weekday night, so try to get there a little earlier to claim your seats for the night."

I get it's on Restaurant Row, and I get that it is an iconic place, but meh....honestly, I've MADE better in my house (which sometimes defeats the whole purpose of going to a place where a professional should be making your meal).Staff is pretty attentive, so that is a good star right there.  Prices are high, but you expect good things from a Steakhouse that's been around nearly 100 years right?  Meh....that defines the whole mean.Tables were so close together, literally I could reach over and take the salt off the next people dining. HINT --- if booking a reservation...try to take minimum 3 people so you can get a larger table...because if it's 2.....you will be packed in a very small area which can be uncomfortable (and the hostess could really care less). It's especially odd when the rear end of the server is facing YOUR table as they are filling water for the table next to you....seriously.Onto the food.  We had surf and turf.....it was good! 3 shrimp (kind of scampi style, but not drowning in butter like you might be thinking) and a small NY Strip. It was OK.   Their signature corn soup is ok...but I wouldn't get again (wasn't that good). Ceasar salad is exactily what is billed but my socks are on my feet. Brussel Sprouts were a rip off. They couldn't even roast them...they steamed them, then tossed them in flavorless oil....was flat out ripped off.  Garlic mashed were pretty good.You get the idea.....for a $200 meal.....it may have been worth $70...and uncomfortable seating.We made a mistake and we wouldn't go back. Nice staff, insanely overpriced, and uncomfortable.  I encourage you to go someplace else. There are LOTS of other choices as you are right on Restaurant Row."

But, you go to a steakhouse for the steak, and each of ours was subpar. I ordered the T-bone. It was dry and tough. I don't know what was wrong with it; my guesses are it wasn't dry-aged as long as they said it was, or it had been frozen, or they cooked it too soon and let it sit under a warmer. Whatever the reason, it was not very good and I couldn't even finish it. Will not be returning."

After standing in the empty restaurant for a few minutes, I guess  a manager came out he begrudgingly said, ""Fine."" When the lovely hostess asked if we'd like a booth or a table, the 'manager' turned around and said, ""They get a table in the front!"" So, we sat in front of the restaurant's window as props I suppose for the passersby. The waiter was nice and his humor was appreciated after feeling inspected for entrance into a totally empty room. The food was really disappointing. The bread served was at best comical. It was such a sad sight. A bite wasn't worth the carbs. The medium rare steak was mostly brown.  The creamed spinach was interesting? I don't know but it did help the dry steak. Mashed potatoes were okay. The one dessert that looked good to me on the menu wasn't available. When we left there were now maybe 20 tables being served and a whole lot of available tables. Which made me wonder why accepting a walk-in was such a production. One star for the hostess and one star for the waiter."

We did not get that water.  The person that greeted us became the bartender and we watched her become the laughing story teller, entertaining the patrons at the bar, which seemed to be the place to be if you wanted service.Finally the busman came and asked us what kind of water we wanted (again) and brought it to us. He also gave us a menu 15 mins later.At one point, I think there were 5 servers behind the bar and noone waiting on us, AT ALLWe were never greeted by a waiter. A random waitress came over and asked us if we wated to order. We said that we would like to order cocktails. She never came back. Finally the laughing story telling hostess bartender came over after my husband summoned her and we ordered cocktails.Another 20 mins later while we watched her anticks at the bar, we were served our cocktails and my Martini had a fly in it :). The server, Abraham, who was finally identified, worked hard and seemed to have a fair amount of experience, although after serving our food, he never came back to ask us how our food was or if we needed anything. After dinner, he did surprise us with a slice of cheese cake and a candle.We asked for our check, finally...We got up to leave and noone ever said goodbye or thank you.Just a note, the restaurant was not crowded..we were the only couple seated at a table in the dining room besides the folks at the bar with a clear shot of the bar and we were clearly visible. There were a few other groups in booths..We called the restaurant when we arrived back to our hotel because we couldnt believe our experience.Just so happens that the laughing story teller answered the phone and could not care less.Folks...this was Frankie and Johnnie's, a NEW York classic that we have talked about for 20 years... This was a $250.00 dinner. This off broadway show would have been amusing if it wasnt such a shame!!What a shame!!BTW The food was ok.

They charged me more 3 times in a row for no reason. I did not notice it the first two times until I got home and read the menu again. Today the same thing happens. They asked $2 more for a $6 takeout. I noticed and questioned them. The explanation was ""oh, I looked at the wrong one."" What?! What is gonna happen if I did not raise question? Never going this place again. Waste of money."

She had ordered fried shrimp, fries, rice and salad. I must say it was pretty good. If I have to recommend a place, it would be this. The shrimp was pretty on point."

1305,8IcowtkuaPf3ZoXIGiNvqg,11/18/2012,5 star rating,"I found this place by driving by as yelp did not put it in my search results for sunset park. I live in sunset park, am fairly new here and could not find good chinese at all. I order the same thing from a variety of local joints and by far this is my favorite! I order pepper steak with onion and make it spicy and the beef actually tastes like beef, it is not fatty and they don't skimp on the beef. The beef to veggie portion is good. and the sauce tastes authentic not like brown water. The rice is also very flavorful. We got chicken and broccoli too and the broccoli was not hard compared to other places, the chicken was good and the egg rolls are huge!  The presentation is good and looks like something you want to eat I am very happy I found my chinese place! My order came super fast too. I plan to order again and thank the prior reviews that lead me to my order here. They have an A on their window too which I look for."

1309,Q8WN9MAahG19j6OHJFkV3w,8/21/2014,2 star rating,"Very casual pool hall. Got there around 1am and was informed that on top of the $12 hourly charge for a pool table, each person that exceeds a party of four has to pay an extra $2. I've been to other pool places but this is the first time I've heard such a thing.The place is kinda worn out, tables are covered with blue plastic sheets with holes in them- which were not pretty to sit nor look at. My friends ordered cheese fries for $4.50, and the Chef Combo was $9.50. A pitcher of Coors was $10. The prices are pretty cheap, but I didn't really enjoy the food so much. The fries was crispy, but had a weird flavor to it. I eat french fries often and I expect my fries to be ON POINT anywhere I order them.Our waitress Cathy was really nice. Service was good. The Asian man at the counter was really nice as well.Not sure if I'd come again."

But other then that it is a place to be when you got nothing to do on a Saturday night. Tables aren't up to date but hey they still work! Parking can be a pain if your trying to find one in the front. It is a bit off the beaten path. But, still worth going into."
1311,Q8WN9MAahG19j6OHJFkV3w,3/26/2017,4 star rating,There were 5 pool tables and it was not busy at all when we arrived at 11:00 in the morning. It was $5 an hour on Sunday which was very reasonable. We had a great time!

They have ping pong and pool as well as a small game room and a bar. The only downside is that there are not a lot of young people there, the place is usually filled with old men. I've never had to wait for a table. As for the cafe/bar I have not yet tried those. Edit- another plus is they are open really late at night and on holidays too :D"
1313,Q8WN9MAahG19j6OHJFkV3w,8/21/2010,4 star rating,"5-stars if that jukebox was still there xD Or if I am allowed to play that piano. Carom is without a doubt, the cleanest and most cigarette smelling-free pool hall in Flushing. Though it takes some time, the food on menu is very yummy (or maybe cuz we come at night, anything is yummy). I've relinquished the cue stick and took up the pingpong paddle. It's loads of fun (and cheap) and a lotta the players aren't seriously pro so you don't have to worry about glares. Most of the nights when we are there, the pingpong room is just rowdy and full of laughs and sh!t-talks. Sometimes the tables next to the bar has serious poker games going on.  There is also a small arcade room, but if you really wanna play arcade, go to Smiles down the block."

1315,Q8WN9MAahG19j6OHJFkV3w,5/6/2010,3 star rating,"Came here after drinks around the area. This place is pretty spacious. There were billiards tables, carom tables and ping pong tables. There were elder Asian men playing both billiards and carom, which you would not want to mess with because they seem very legendary and very good at the games they play. We went to play ping pong, which is located towards the back. Once entered into this area, I felt like we were in someone's basement. It was a large room with chipped light blue paint all around. The last time I played ping pong was when I was in summer camp and I was 7. Now more than a decade later, okay a decade and a few years later...here I was relearning how to play ping pong. It was pretty cool and I had fun. I kept forgetting how light a ping pong ball is and I smack it like I am playing tennis. Yea gotten used to playing tennis and just can't control my swings. But will definitely come back when I'm out in Queens."
1316,Q8WN9MAahG19j6OHJFkV3w,3/10/2009,3 star rating,I used to spend hours and hours at this place play pool.  From what I remember. it's a pretty big billiards. tables were decent. the only problem was very hard to find street parking.. unless u want to valetI remember i played 6 hrs and only paid 40$.. I'm sure they are more expensive now but still better price than manhattan billiards. If you don't own a car.. it's still walkable distance from Flushing main street. probably 15 minutes walk. I need to go back home and check out this place again.
1317,Q8WN9MAahG19j6OHJFkV3w,8/12/2016,1 star rating,This place has gone down hill. It's located in an unsafe area across from the projects. They do not have a security guard and as a result my girlfriend had her wallet stolen while she was playing pool tonight. Let this be a warning to all those that want to hsve a safe place to drink and have a good time because this place is not the place to do it.

Tucked away in East Harlem, this place is conveniently located on 124th street a quick hop from the train. The folks there are inviting, the space is very open and filled with natural light from the large windows that span the two sides of the corner establishment. Bagel Tree has high quality food, at fair costs. Service is great and they deliver too. Only issue would be hours for me so it is not the most convenient if one works until evening and looking for a bite. For a weekend pick me up or weekday lunch, this place is the one!"

The salad, paninis, cream cheese, tuna salad, and the other stuff inside looks like it's been sitting there for quite a long time. You can tell by the texture it's not fresh.

I bought my friend here and they agreed it was delicious.Also the woman who owns the shop is super friendly.

1324,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,6/3/2014,3 star rating,"I've been working in this area for the past 14 years and finally have a quality place to eat. On the positive side, the place is nice and clean and the staff is very friendly. The food quality is good and the food is fresh. The salads are great as well as the burgers ( fries are not that great ) Free WIFI with seats too. The breakfast menu is pretty good too. On the negative side, it is the prices. The nickname we give at our work is the robbery joint because they will take your money. I'm always surprised how much I pay for any Item there including the coffee ( sucks)I guess I'm surprised because where the store is, Spanish Harlem not midtown Manhattan. This area had changed a lot in 14 years and this store represents the change so myself and my coworkers are still getting used to paying close to $10 for a sandwich and drink (the building where this store is was built around 3 ago)Again, quality, cleanliness, food and staff are very good but it can be pricey."

The gentlemen that prepare the food are so amazingly friendly and courteous.  However, I can't say the same about one of the ladies that works at the register and prepares the beverages.  If it wasn't because my daughter is such a picky eater I would've stopped coming here a long time ago. It's sad that the friendly and courteous ways from the gentlemen doesn't carry over to the ladies."
1328,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,1/2/2022,2 star rating,"I was pretty underwhelmed with this pho-consideridering I had heard so much about Flushing food being so good. Service was pretty lackluster and I wasn't approached when I walked in nor when I sat down except to take my order-no water was brought out. I ordered the pho tai and it came out probably like 3 minutes later, which is never a good sign. The meat was cut too large and too thick, making me do more work by tearing them up and grinding with my teeth. The broth was not flavorful, even with all the condiments I added. I would not try this pho again."
1329,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,6/6/2020,3 star rating,"Dine in: Good dependable place if you have a pho craving and want to eat it quick, probably sharing a table with other groups or solo diners. I ate at the restaurant once but never went back because of the surly waiters. The place could also be cleaner... just don't look at anything too closely hah ;) However, they have good portions of traditional viet food and the spring rolls are delicious!! nicely stuffed and crispy. The broth is of course great! Takeout due to COVID: On a Friday night in June I waited there around 15 minutes after placing the order in person (tried to call, but the poor guy working was too busy to pick up the phone). He was stressed with so many orders all at once, so don't expect him to be patient. just shout your order and pay (CASH ONLY).The food hit the spot! Two #1s pho's, a banh mi, a large spring rolls (6) for $37.50. Everything was packed carefully and they give you lettuce, bean sprouts, lime, mint, orange sauce (for spring rolls) and oyster sauce mixed with sriracha for the pho. Banh mi was good - bread not as good (a bit chewy) as Manhattan Chinatown places, but it definitely fulfilled my banh mi craving! Would go get their takeout again! but if you want a better dine in experience and great food, there's pho best 2 a few blocks away, which is my fave (although not open yet at time of writing due to COVID)."
1330,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,11/15/2021,5 star rating,This right here is my childhood. I've been coming here since I was a child when I used to live a block away. Literally other pho places in queens cannot compare! I always order the pho with grilled pork chop and the spring rolls. Honestly the crispy spring rolls is a must !!!! Definitely will recommend!!!!
1331,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,2/2/2021,5 star rating,"As a Vietnamese person, I can tell you that Pho Bang is the closest thing to authentic Vietnamese food you can find within Flushing and eastern Queens. For $20, you will be filled with an appetizer, entree, and dessert or drink. The food is affordable; a delicious bowl of pho with all the add ins like beef brisket, meatballs, flank steak, onions, cilantro, and bean sprouts will only cost ($10). The cashier takes orders on the phone like speed dial and will tell you the order is ready in 10 minutes but you will find dozens of people also picking up their order. They make the food really quickly here which is a huge plus. While you're thinking about what to order, get some Vietnamese fried spring rolls (cha gio), three color shaved ice dessert (che ba mau), and viet iced coffee (ca phe sua da). If you're more adventurous than the regular bowl of pho, order shaking beef with rice (bo luc lac), shrimp and beef with rice noodles (bun tom bo xao), or grilled pork chops over rice (com suon bi cha)."
1332,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,4/25/2021,3 star rating,"Quality seems to have changed recently, likely due to current events. Pho tasted like nothing special, average compared to any other pho place in Chinatowns. Spring rolls were not amazing in any noticeable way. Fish sauce seemed more watered down than usual.Place was packed and everyone seemed to be enjoying the food, which was great to see. Every other table was in service- good social distancing despite being indoors. Staff was attentive to our party."
1333,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,9/21/2021,5 star rating,"One of the oldest restaurants in flushing. You can tell by age of the waiters that this place has survived through many long years in flushing and the food proves it. Simple homey and affordable with hours open late (for flushing). Try the staples: pho, bun bo hue, grilled chicken, beef cubes; they're all reliable. Also get the iced coffee with condensed milk, it's very authentic drip coffee served like how they do in Vietnam."
1334,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,10/5/2019,4 star rating,"With so many restaurants in Flushing, it took me awhile to come back to this longtime staple. Stepping in, was like going back in time. The lighting gives the restaurant a feeling that it's been around forever. The elderly staff made me wondering if they were the same people from the original spot. Order the #1, that's all you need to know. Their signature pho, in a flavorful broth, topped with thinly sliced beef (pro tip: tuck the semi raw beef into the broth to cook), and a slew of tender yummyness. The spring/ summer roll is usually the go-to. My only complaint was that the broth wasn't hot (important when consuming pho). The staff was on point. The place only takes cash; & the 7 train takes you right (near) there."

Plus one side of Guacamole to see how well they prepare these avacados. 2 - Bistec Tacos *** stars1 - Pollo Taco *** stars1 - Guacamole * starThe guacamole was not very good. sometimes I wonder how mexicans can fuck up an avacado but they did. It was a pudding, dripping consistency like they cut it with some oil or something else no chunks of avacado could be found any where.

They told us RUDELY it's for customers only. We came in as customers and we're treated like we were in there causing trouble. So I went to find the bathroom way in the back and someone comes out of the kitchen (no mask btw, even though there's multiple signs saying no mask no service) and screams at me WHAT DO YOU WANT?? and I asked for the bathroom and he told me it was upstairs (which it wasn't????) So I get in the bathroom and  there is BLOOD on the seat, great.

And that's the beauty about Two Boots pizza, there are many different styles and sizes. We all don't have to agree on one large pizza.We snagged a spot a block away and walk into an empty spot. There's cool art everywhere, from the tables to the wall paintings. All rock and Brooklyn themes, we're all taking pictures and having fun.We ordered a small Mr. Pink and something similar to a regular pizza. What Two Boots is known for are their white pies. The girls don't like white pizza so regular it is!I'm looking outside and I see a large peach tree? A tree grows in Brooklyn?? Very cool.The pizza comes to our table, man it's on like Donkey Kong. Hot, sexy Pizza in the funked up Two Boots style. The corn meal crust is always a welcomed treat, we ate both pies like it was no ones business.There are many pizza choices you can make, especially in Brooklyn NY.

The thick, dry, tasteless dough had the consistency of cardboard. The thin layer of cheese was unevenly melted and randomly distributed. None of the toppings had flavor. It's amazing that such an inferior *pizza* place in Brooklyn, New York, can survive. Maybe it's better when you order it on site, and not for delivery.

Had the cheese pizza (excellent), Grandma's pizza (delicious), and loaded veggie pizza (delightful). They also accommodated our special request for plain buttered spaghetti for the kids, and gave us bread and butter to go with it. Note: we ate at the place, not delivery, so the pizza was fresh off the tray. They have a few tables way in back. It was perfect for a fast lunch on the way to Governor's Island."

Lo and behold, Pronto Pizza was right in front of me. It was my density.*The place was actually pretty packed for 3 pm on a weekday, which always bodes well for the food (high turnover = fresh pies). I'm a sucker for BBQ chicken in all its forms, so after waiting my turn (the service was not as pronto as one would hope), I asked the guy to throw a slice in the oven.**It popped out a few minutes later, and I was pleasantly surprised. The BBQ chicken was fresh and tender (although the crust was a little too far on the crunchy side of crisp), and a drizzle of ranch dressing never hurt anyone. At $3.75, it was a solid lunch, and it hit the spot. I'd do it again. ____________*Hello, McFly.**Pizza purists, don't judge me."
1361,fuLGTn6H_BLEa1ahGGzebQ,5/13/2017,5 star rating,"I see all the negative reviews on here and I got to say, I actually really like this pizza place.Pronto Pizza serves both thin crust and thick crust pizza. The pizza with toppings are the thicker crust (pan pizza) while the classic pizza is the thinner crust.Some of the options are Chicken Broccoli, Meat Lovers, Penne Vodka, Hawaiian, Bbq,  Chicken Bacon Ranch, Whole Wheat, etc.They also have Garlic Knots, Calzones, Soups, Salads, Appetizers, Hero's, Rolls & Wraps.-What I've tried-Whole Wheat Pizza : 4/5Regular Pizza : 5/5The classic slice was so good even though it was so simple. It had the perfect crust to cheese to tomato sauce ratio and even without all the seasonings, the flavor was on pointe.The wheat slice actually had decent flavor and is worth trying out if you can't eat regular pizza bread but I personally wouldn't order again. The way they put the cheese and tomato sauce isn't like the classic pizza by the way and I just didn't like the flavor of the dough itself.Service is prompt and very friendly. One of the girls that works there seems to be the owner's family and is very nice.Overall, I can't resist this place if I'm in the area. Check it out !"

I can speak for true Chicken Parm, Shrimp Parm, Eggplant Rollantini and a lot of the menu. The sauce here is pretty good. My mom always orders be chicken roll and on only like one occasion was it delivered cooler than wanted but again that was one occasion. The food here is good. It's not an Italian restaurant, it's a pizzeria that makes good take out dishes. I've had the meatballs and Calamari and they are enjoyable too. The minestrone soup taste like it was made fresh. I like the fact I can order the dinners with a salad especially those who are trying to lose weight, the salads have roasted peppers, olives, cucumbers and tomatoes(that's an awesome side salad for a meal. You're lucky if you get carrots and tomatos at some places.The prices are reasonable for what you get and they are in delivery apps, which is also a plus in my opinion."

The sweetest man always answered the phone to take our order. I can't speak to the whole menu bc a well done grandma pie was our go to order and it never disappointed!

I've managed to get the best quality pizza and wings on those nights (vs. others).My go-to fave is the Sicilian with pepperoni. Oh-so-good.The wings though. What happened?! The first time I ordered them, the wings were un-bbq-ed, super crispy and the buffalo sauce came on the side. I was in heaven. For some reason, they stopped doing that. Please, please bring it back.Oh and the mini garlic knots are puffy bites of perfection."
1367,fuLGTn6H_BLEa1ahGGzebQ,11/22/2016,1 star rating,"I'm over this place- completely will never order from here again. The delivery tonight was absolutely unacceptable. My usual order is a Grandma Specialty Pizza Pie and a Minestrone Soup. It was the 2nd time in the same month that my minestrone soup was delivered with 25% of it spilled all over the bag it was packed in and all over the top of my pizza box (see uploaded photos). I don't understand why their chef can't close a soup lid properly where it can't rip through the paper bag it comes in. Or, maybe the business should order better soup containers with stronger lids. I order from here so frequently because I love the Grandma Specialty ($18) and I love the Minestrone Soup ($5). I looked over the past receipts for the month of November and I spent over $150 ordering from here (just for myself)! Another time that I ordered from here, they accidentally delivered a lentil soup instead of a minestrone soup. I'm not usually the type of guy to send something back to the kitchen, especially if it was a delivery order. But, I really don't like lentil. And, if I'm paying $5 + tax + tip for a cup of soup then I expect it to be a soup that I can actually eat. So, I ended up calling the restaurant to let them know that the soup order was wrong. And, the guy over the phone (let's call him ""the boss"") told me that I ordered lentil soup and not minestrone soup. And, I was looking at my Seamless receipt, and it said minestrone soup. ""The boss"" did not take responsibility that it was completely his mistake and would not own up to it. He had to ask me what my address was. If he knew (allegedly) which delivery this was pertaining to then why would he say that I ordered a lentil soup when he didn't even know what order I was referring to? Before I got off the phone with ""the boss,"" I asked him if I should return the soup to the delivery guy. He said ""no, keep it.""So, the delivery guy arrives with the minestrone soup and hands it over to me. The delivery guy tells me that ""the boss wants the other soup back."" This is why I refer to the guy on the phone as ""the boss."" If he's the boss, then he has to fix his attitude with customers. I gave the delivery guy the lentil soup and sent him on his merry way. I will absolutely miss the Grandma Specialty Pizza, but I refuse to support this business until they apologize and own up to their mishaps."

I still give them 2 stars because the food (other than plantains) isn't bad and moderately priced.  Service sucks! Ellos empiezan de lo mas bien y chin a chin se van dañando.  Si llamas para que te hagan un delivery, te mandan los platanos maduros como que son para un animal.  Es una falta de respeto.  Las mayorias de las personas que contestan el telefono son brutisimos, sin nada de etica.  Aun asi le doy la dos estrellitas esa, porque la comidita no e mala na (a excepción de los maduros).  El servicio al cliente es una basura!"

It's fucking ridiculous, this has happened multiple times but I never go there to buy food for myself I do it as a favor for my aunt which I constantly remind here it is not good to give your money to businesses like this.

Why would they serve something so hot? maybe they used the microwave to heat it up instead of cooking it on an order basis. I always order salami sandwich from other places and it is never so hot.

There are numerous boothes and tables to sit and also a small bar, a TV which when I came in was tuned to Spanish language news about the Venezuelan election results.  They have a $4 breakfast special which is an incredibly good deal, however I was pretty hungry and wanting to try more things so I paid more to get a bigger sampling."

No frills, simple and delicious. Not only is drenched in condensed milk and goodness but the cake is moist and gooey. And the right amount of cinnamon whipped cream. It is just magnificent! Hub ordered one for my birthday. It was the best gift ever! There are also other flavors that I have yet to try. And it so happens to be our upcoming 10th anniversary. Their menu had a raspberry and lemon cake which also happened to be our wedding cake flavor. I will def place an order with them for the occasion. The shop is very small and meant for pick-up to go. There is a table and chair that you can sit for cupcakes and small treats. As far as cake pricing goes, it is extremely reasonable compared to other pricier bakeries."

Between the dry cake and the generous heap of gritty frosting, I usually tap out after the first bite.However! Buttah's cupcakes are a textural dream of perfectly moist cake and light but rich frosting. The cupcakes and other baked goods are consistently phenomenal. Top favs are the red velvet - and I have never been a rabid red velvet fan, Brooklyn Blackout and the Funfetti, which is the best white cake/buttercream frosting bite I have ever had. We order from Buttah for special occasions too, and their full-size layer cakes are tastefully decorated and just as delicious as the cupcakes. It's worth noting that I have never had a stale cupcake or pastry from Buttah. More times than I would like to admit I've gone to a pastry shop for a quick treat only to discover I've been fobbed off a days-old confection at full price. Never ever at Buttah.Don't forget to try their bread puddings, raspberry frangipane and chocolate bundt cake slices. They are all masterfully made and totally worth the indulgence."

The strawberry daiquiri and sangria were so watered down and didn't taste alcoholic. Second, the bouncer thought I was using a fake ID since I look young, but I was older than everyone I was with. He was very rude. Third, I was harassed for not drinking. They said everyone needs to order at least 2 drinks and I said I had to leave soon anyway to catch a train. He came back five minutes later and noticed I hadn't left and demanded I order a drink. I left right away. Fourth, you are not allowed to order from the bar. You must order from a waiter which takes forever and they want higher tips. Finally, the tables are so cramped that when people get up, they basically bump into your table and drinks.I noticed people said similar things in other reviews.

We told him we didn't want to stay and they refused to check us out unless we pay for a total of four drinks regardless if we drank them or not. Knowing our discomfort, he didn't offer any other resolution besides paying for something we no longer wanted.

As a disgruntled customer, I approached our server/bartender whom immediately said because we asked for our shots ""chilled"" he added ice in our shots and the ice melted and thus diluted our shots. I've never heard of a bar admit that chilling our shots would mean we would essentially have water mixed with the vodka shots. Additionally, we got ripped off on pricing.

The coffee remains unchanged - still extremely light.  The lox bagel was pretty good, but I wish they had various bagel selections besides the boring plain.There is room for improvement with the food and options, but one thing I must note is that the service here is impeccable.  Wait staff and owners alike, are exceptionally friendly.  On top of that, you get 15% off if you check in on Yelp!  There's also a huge parking lot at the plaza where Ozone Diner is situated, so stop by and try this new addition to the nabe out!"

1403,R2mT2LVQRnstpDNkcgx-oQ,10/3/2016,3 star rating,"Just wanted a quick meal on the way out of town and this was the closest with good reviews. The diner was very clean and obviously opened recently with all the signage for a ""Grand Opening"" still up. As I opened the menu I noticed that it wasn't the typical diner menu with at least 10 pages of menu items. It was a very limited menu and did not have some things that I would expect a diner to have at regular diner prices. The prices seemed a little high, but I was willing to explore into something new and different. The order was placed and the food almost arrived immediately and I was impressed with the quick turnaround. I have read several reviews that the wait staff can be annoying, but did not notice that at all. However, at one point another customer had walked in and not sure who he was, but you could tell the hostess and maybe the owner at the front desk knew exactly who he was and you could see an urgency to tend to him by the front desk staff.I ordered a Reuben and was a little disappointed in the presentation. It seems that all sandwiches are presented ""open-faced"" and you put it together yourself. The Russian dressing was on the side and the meat was well down, but borderline on dried out. I managed through the meal and was just plain hungry so no complaints to anyone. I though that the decor of the restaurant stood out from most other diners and again, the place was very clean and no diner smell like a greasy spoon hole in the wall."

The food is exactly what you'd expect from a diner.  Affordable, sizable, and hits the spot when you're hungry."

I've been here twice and I was satisfied with my meal on both occasions. They have a wide array of selections; from breakfast to dinner and also wonderful desserts. However, breakfast seems to be their forte in my book. I've had an omelette with spinach, mushroom, and onions and a garden omelette with cheddar; they were both delicious. The omelettes come with a side of home fries but their was nothing special about them. On both occasions I was here the service was terrible. They never checked on me, rarely refilled my water, and they were just hard to get a hold of in general. During my last visit the waiter forgot to bring out the French toast I ordered. Thankfully they offer 10% off with a yelp check-in which is a nice little bandaid for not so good service I suppose."

I came on a Monday recently and sat on the 5th floor. Servers were attentive and had plenty of suggestions. We ordered the kalbi and pork belly for 2 people, and I'm glad I didn't come hungry because the portion certainly didn't match the price. The quality and taste were good, but feel like similar places have the same thing for better value. The banchan, especially the steamed egg, were my fav part of the meal."

Easy enough for us to hop on the train and be there in 45 minutes so decided to venture for lunch. Located on 2 floors (2nd & 5th) and we were directed to the 2nd for BBQ. Got off the elevator and greeted immediately. Looked around and the interior seemed bright and open. Music was going and my 16 year old was happy . Seated us in a booth, which was rather spacious. For a 2:00 on a Friday, the place had a nice crowd. Our server greeted us relatively quickly and throughout the meal the service was wonderful. Many hands make light work..We definitely over ordered, but that's what we do. A few items 'completed passes'. The pork belly was the star. Definite touchdown!"

If you have a choice go with the higher floor (I think they have 3 & 5). Has a fun themed feel to the decoration of this place the top floor has a larger bar so while you wait, and chances are you will be waiting, you can get a drink at the bar. On the lower level you can order beers while waiting. For food, we always go with one of the grilled meat sets. When I went this week we got the marinated meats, two beef and one pork. All three options were good but the two beef options were much better. With all of the sets you get a free bonus meat option, one of the intestines from the menu. I've never had intestines before but our waiter mentioned the marinated version tasted like squid. Honestly it totally did and I was surprised with home much I liked it. You get a ton of banchans or sides, they did seem to change between the times I visited. My favorites were the kimchi, the green onion kimchi, large shaved radish and the corn cheese (which was a total surprise that I got the second time I visited and not the first). The first time I went we got lettuce to make wraps with and when we didn't get them the second time I asked about it and they just said the only lettuce they had was the salad, odd. They can skip making the macaroni salad though, it was meh and an odd thing at kbbq."

And not sure if too much msg as well since we both were drinking plenty of water and felt thirsty afterwards.Japchae was really good but the downside is that they took the wrong order (we ordered with beef and came in veggie only). We kept the veggie order but he was like, ""yeah there is no meat in here I can see that""The waiter attitude was not really good. Not sure if it was because he was expecting us to order bbq items instead.Banchan is poor"

This is my 2nd time here and I think it is a very good KBBQ place. The servers cook the meat so you  don't have to do anything.The waiters are very attentive and the quality of meat is also good. I think KBBQ in general is a relatively more expensive in NYC, but I would say this place would definitely satisfy your craving."

I really didn't know what most of the side accompaniments were but they were pretty tasty too! I'm choosing to leave a star off this review because the place was pretty hard to find- it's located up a few floors so you won't see it just passing by."

I had some of there buffalo wings and avocado fries (both delicious).My pescatarian friend asked if the waiter if possible may she have fish tacos (something that wasn't on the menu) which was made possible was very nice of him.

The reason why I was okay with coming here because it was divey but the food was good and prices were decent.   They no longer have the happy hour from 3-10 and have increased the prices.  The last time I went the wings were bland and I legit can go to a nicer establishment up the block for the same price.

Also wasn't the most flavorful. The margaritas weren't that great either. Even though the food wasn't the highlight. The service was really good, friendly staff."

It's definitely a nice chill spot to grab drinks. The service was really well too.The reason for the 2 rating is the food. I ordered the chicken fingers (4 pieces) and fries. The chicken was extremely dry and over cooked. I also wasn't aware that I'd be getting what seemed like 4 full chicken breast as chicken fingers. Maybe that should be clarified on the menu or by the staff when ordering. My friend had the chicken tacos which she enjoyed. We shared avocado fries which were different and pretty bland. The dipping sauce they came with was just ok.

It felt right upon entering, a little divey but friendly, with excellent service, good specials (beer and a shot for $9, crazy!) and good food. I had the veggie quesadilla as they were out of veggie burgers, and my partner had the chicken panini, a formidable sandwich that he polished off no problem.Did I mention the service? Sometimes divey bars have divey service, but not at Grill.Watching basketball, chatting with the locals and getting our Sunday night drink on, allowed us to really relax and enjoy our time.Any time we're in Harlem, you can be sure we'll stop at the Grill."

Nice Bar area upfront and equally nice back room.Food: I had the veggie quesadilla, the brussel sprouts were a nice touch! I also tried the loaded fries with bacon which was also good. They did not bring any napkins or silverware with the food, sigh.Drinks: I had a frozen margarita and a Moscow Mule. Both were tasty, but a little pricey. $12 and $11 respectively, but when I got my bill to close out, the bartender charged me for two margaritas instead. I didn't ask her to correct it cause I didn't have time to wait.Service: I think they did a decent job in hosting a large group but there were a couple of small things listed above that could have been improved. Service at the bar was steady but did take time, I thought it was nice that the bartender remembered my name when I went back up to the bar, nice touch!Prices: Cocktails were too pricey especially for day drinking. Food quality was good for the price.Overall: Grill on the Hill is a great place to watch sports, have a beer and a bite, with a few tweaks, this place would be a 5 star establishment."

I ordered the bulgogi bibimbap (which is served cold, except for the bulgogi) for pickup. Some places serve it cold and others hot so I didn't mind but I do prefer hot. Firstly, bibimbap usually has a fried eggs on it but at this place it costs extra bringing my total to 13.50. I picked it up and the woman at the counter was very friendly. There is one table there in case you want to dine in. I got home and realized the egg I ordered wasn't in it. There was also a very small amount of bulgogi. I would say maybe less than a quarter cup. This was disappointing because I've gotten bibimbap elsewhere in NYC that has had double the beef, the egg included and was the same price or only 1$ more. The vegetables were fresh but the whole dish had an over salted taste. I could tell the bulgogi was good but there wasn't enough of it to remotely satisfy. Maybe ordering the bulgogi bowl would be a better route?"
1429,L5ZsbTGT1G52p11pNf0EXg,8/4/2018,4 star rating,"This is a solid joint for Korean takeout in the area.  The Bulgogi and Galbi are pretty solid, but I find the Spicy Pork bowl to be the best - the Cilantro in it gives a really nice fresh taste.  My main issue is with the inconsistent quality.  Sometimes I'll walk in there and it's definitely coming straight off the stovetop, but others...there is a microwave that I've seen used.  Microwaved thin cuts of meat are not the best, and it definitely affects the freshness of the dish.  It's still solid, but not great in that state.  So really, I either give this place a 5-star when it's fresh, or a 3-star when it's not -- average out to a 4-star."

We were not expecting to find some of the best Korean food we've had anywhere.It was really that good. We chatted a bit with the owner, whose jobs included working the register, taking care of customers, and cooking all the food (in a kitchen that appeared built for at least 3 or 4 busy line cooks). She mentioned that her original goal had been to conquer all of Brooklyn by delivering everywhere--a plan that was thwarted by traffic. She still has wide-eyed dreams of renewing her conquest eventually, delivering bibimbop across the borough via tiger-striped drones. Until then, my one major complaint about Tiger Box persists: it's nowhere near my neighborhood.I have a minor complaint, too, but it's one that I grumble at every Korean takeout place: there's just so much packaging material. So, so much plastic. Is it really worth destroying the planet just to have a brief taste of TB's sublime spicy chicken bowl and kimchee? Yes, it is. But I'd rather not be forced to make that choice. Be warned that there's very little room to eat inside ... it's mostly built for takeout and delivery."

I was hungry and it was late so I just reheated it and ate it anyways. Then 30 minutes later it gave me food poisoning.**EDIT**Owner called me back and was very nice. Said she would give me a refund. I don't know if the issue is with her kitchen or potentially Seamless's delivery being late and making the food cold...but at least she tried to reconcile the issue.

The pork bowl and spicy stewed chicken are standouts for me, but everything I've had has been fantastic. Bibimbop is a delight, with perfectly seasoned beef. The dooboo-jun are delicious. The kimchi is fantastic.Order any of the bento boxes and you'll see just how generous she is with both variety and portion size.A lot of Korean food in Brooklyn is simply missing depth of flavor. It's hard to put a finger on why, but just seems as though the broths, stews, sauces are put together in a hurry. Always tastes like a pale shadow of the best Korean food in Queens and Manhattan. Sy, the chef at Tiger Box, knows the flavors and ingredients intimately, and seems unwilling to compromise on constructing her dishes."

We tried the veggie bibimbop, the seafood stew and a vegetarian jjigae. All really flavorful, fresh and delicious. We had some leftovers and the cook came over and added some rice to it for us to take home. There is one communal table which can fit maybe 6-8 people, so more of a take out place.

It would be difficult to mess up the service like that.FoodOh. My. God. It's food magic. This is one of the places where if you don't order something basic like a burger you'll be treated with tiny portions of expensive food that is OH SO WORTH.

1443,_jJ41TGH9O9eZ54KYNZEhA,1/22/2021,5 star rating,"We had a phenomenal meal here. Being from NJ, we didn't realize restaurants were still closed for indoor dining in NY. We sat outside on a very cold day in the Greenhouse, which houses just one table (could seat four), and grabbed a bottle of moonshine at the liquor shop next door to warm up quickly. The borscht came out first and was one of the best borscht soups we have ever had. Add the meat to it, it's tasty. Next was the fois gras brulee, which was a bit overdone - the flavor of the berries was so strong that you miss the delicacy of the fois gras- so you really need to eat it deconstructed to get the flavor of every component- and individually every component tasted good separately. The beet pasta with lamb was hearty and had a good bite to it, I enjoyed the almonds (crunch) and grated cheese over it too. The lamb with Brussels sprouts and dill was well seasoned with pepper but I thought could use a touch more salt. It was tender and the garnishes all came well together for a composed plate. The dessert (chocolate tart) was rich, and the pumpkin pie had a tasty crust- it wasn't amazing but wasn't a throwaway either. You could tell it was homemade and thoughtful. Overall, it is a hands-down five-star meal, and the prices were very reasonable. Two people can have a three course meal for around $100 and that is great value, considering the quality of ingredients and quality of your meal. I would highly recommend it"

If its still on the menu, everyone needs to try the apple pie. The apples are like thinly sliced and will melt away in your mouth - allllmost apple sauce consistently. Which is great for me because I always thought classic apple pie filling had too hard of a texture on the chunky diced apple pieces. The cheddar cheese ice cream is also soooo good. Hot desserts with cold ice cream are one of my favorites and the chef excels at these types of dishes."

Didn't snap a picture of the honey lavender ice cream but it was yum, cheddar ice cream not a fav but still ate it all.

But then he dumped them all in without a care. So now they are all broken. It's like they really don't want customers. It was raining today, and he just threw the box at me after wrapped it. I had to ask for a bag so the cookies wouldn't get wet. If this is how he treats the only customer in the store, imagine his attitude to me if there were more people in the shop, he probably would have just smashed my cookies for fun."

I bad does service have to be in NYC to get marked down??? Still, want to get my wife some delicious treats celebrating her birthweek (one day celebration is not enough), I stopped in. It was about 7pm on a Sunday, and a friendly older woman was working alone behind the counter. As a lover of baked goods, I felt like a kid in a candy store. So many wonderful colors and shapes, cookies and biscuits, cakes and pastries! How do you choose? The first guess is easy: my wife loves carrot cake, so she gets carrot cake. Next, the rainbow cake looked nice (big, with brightly colored sponge and plenty of icing), so I got a slice of that. Also asked for a couple of mini cannoli (vanilla and chocolate), and headed on home.Home, where the disappointment could begin.Now, the bakery has a distinct 1960s vibe to it. I learned quickly that is probably the decade these cakes were baked. Both the care cake and the rainbow cake were so stale and dry, they were almost crunchy. The carrot cake was almost redeemed by a robust cream cheese frosting, but there was no such savior for the rainbow cake. That frosting tasted like bland sugary crisco. How bad was it? We at less than 1/2 of each of them and threw the rest away.The cannelloni were OK, especially the chocolate one. In that case, the chocolate coating protected the pastry from becoming soggy (a fate to which the vanilla succumbed).So..... now I know. The ratings are deserved, and I don't need to go back again. Not with so many other great bakeries around the city."

It had all the qualities to make it seem like an amazing bakery - its been in the area for 50+ years, the decor had an old mom and pop vibe, and the sweet aura coming from the store drew you in. Sadly, the sweet smells were a complete lie to the quality of these baked goods.I have given this place three chances since I live near the area and the smell always gets me when I walk by. The cakes and cookies I have tried have always been dry and lacking in quality ingredients. To make it worse, the last time I came here, there were live bugs in the bag feasting on my chocolate fudge balls! Don't waste your time going here. A complete disappointment!"

Upon walking in, one will noticed shelves and shelves of cookies of different varieties. They sell by the pound and you get to mix and match your cookies as well. I wanted something small so I settled for the black and white cookies and I was amazed by the taste since I've never had this New York favorite before. Would I be back in the future. Sure. Service was on-point and the cashier was more than happy to answer any questions."

Lame excuse, won't be coming back here again!"
1458,vmNpt3yV5PGCEOoOpmqwRQ,1/7/2016,3 star rating,Cheap drinks and chill atmosphere. Just lots of old dudes lol. One young bartender that's normally here is amazingly nice and let us eat pizza in here! Other one is a bit grouchy but gets the job done! During term this place is packed w Columbia students. When there's break it's really chill and empty :D

I really always thought that I had some skill or at least ""beginner's luck"" with the game but really...I don't. The bar has a nice layout, sort of old school. It's basically a rectangle with darts when you walk in, a long bar on the left and plastic cover booths on the right with a pool table at the tail. Columbia students abound and I'm guessing we were probably the only folks in there not associated in some way with the university. One of the things that stood out to me was the bartender. He was actually nice. And the drinks were cheap, I ordered two grey goose sodas and a stella and the bill came to an even $15. This is a solid spot when you're in the middle of nowhere C-Country."

This bar has changed my life in more ways than one. the bartender, Andrea who he mentioned actually  introduced me to my wife and when my priest bailed she stepped up and took his place. I clicked on his account and let's just say he is an infamous zero-star reviewer and has reviews like ""males like myself want to be catered to especially by a female server or bartender..."". 1020 is a chill student bar, they have cheap good drinks and a cool atmosphere but the biggest customer base is college students so they don't keep much beyond the well on hand, they probably just didn't have it in stock."

My boba came out in a timely manner and the staff were polite. I got one of their specials - Lemon Wintermelon with basil seeds and boba at 50% sweetness. It had cut up pieces of lemon and lime which made it very refreshing. Boba was okay, not over cooked but nothing super specific to rave about. Will I be back? Probably.

I highly recommend the regular bubble milk tea and if you want to avoid milk and go a little more healthy then the honey green tea. Great for sore throats !!

My friend and I have walked several blocks down, and suddenly we began craving tea. Initially, we were walking down to this area to try the famous ice cream place, but the crave for tea overcame us and we crossed the block to have tea here. The line wasn't so long, so we were able to order and receive our drinks quickly. Even though the area was packed, we got the seats beside the window. The drinks and the cold air conditioning helped us refresh and replenish our stamina, but staying there for a while became chilly, so we ended up finishing the rest of the tea outside."
1502,jk1czy1OiwpEBlWxM8wDlw,7/23/2019,4 star rating,"I think I'd give all Gong Cha locations a solid 4 stars. I've been to a few in around NYC and Boston and they all seem pretty consistent. I wouldn't say it's my most favorite boba place but when I'm craving boba, they have yet to disappoint. This Gong Cha is located in Chinatown, not too far from the park. It's very small like other boba places, with only a few seats inside. Most people will grab and go their drinks. I was here on a Monday afternoon around 6:30 pm ish. There wasn't too big of a line. My boba came out in a timely manner and the staff were polite. I got one of their specials - Lemon Wintermelon with basil seeds and boba at 50% sweetness. It had cut up pieces of lemon and lime which made it very refreshing. Boba was okay, not over cooked but nothing super specific to rave about. Will I be back? Probably. Will I travel through rain and snow to come to Gong Cha? Probably not. However it's a solid place that satisfies the boba craving."
1503,jk1czy1OiwpEBlWxM8wDlw,3/20/2017,4 star rating,"I went to ""Go-long Cha"" with my buddies Aaron Rodgers, Eli Manning and Tom Brady, and it wasn't half as good as this place.What to get: Brown Sugar Milk TeaHow to improve: Better serviceGong Cha is a wonderful international bubble tea chain which I first tried in NYC. Some of the locations have really unfriendly employees (cough cough Queens and Manhattan), whereas others are awesome (cough cough Toronto), but all of them put out a consistently delicious product. The employees at this particular Chinatown Manhattan location are not particularly friendly either, but their milk teas are excellent.I took refuge from a downpour which soaked the entire city of New York, for a good half an hour. The interior is really nice but wasn't nearly warm enough on such a cold day, so I spent most of the time shivering. But back to the products.The Brown Sugar Milk Tea rivals the very best chain store examples of how good bubble tea can be. It's milky, perfect, and has that deep brown sugar taste that gives it a real texture difference from your average milk tea. The hot version is wonderful in cold weather, and the cold version is delicious in any weather.While I still prefer the Okinawa (same type of tea) at Sharetea, NYC doesn't have any of those. Gong Cha is right up there with the Milk Tea at Coco, although the little locally owned place - Tea And Milk in Astoria - is best of all.And if you're skinny and tall with long arms and long legs, then skip this place, and go to ""Gangly Cha."""
1504,jk1czy1OiwpEBlWxM8wDlw,1/27/2017,5 star rating,"Though there are two Gong Chas within ~3 blocks of each other, this location is always my first choice. There are a few seating areas in here so grabbing a drink and catching up with your friends is an option. They recently added a check-in to receive a free topping so you can save that 50-75 cents and try all the different toppings on the menu! My favorite drinks from here are the taro milk tea (it is milky and has a mouthful of taro flavor but can get too grainy/powdery), the yogurt series (delicious with coconut jelly or white pearls), and the milk tea series (not too milky nor too watery). They also have an option of soy or whole milk which most bubble tea places don't offer so all you lactose intolerant or vegan people, come hither.As Gong Cha is starting to get popular, there are wait times during rush hour so try to venture here after the off hours to receive a delicious drink. Gong Cha has also started a new oreo series which I have yet to try but the pictures definitely look appealing and will start to compete with kung fu teas drinks."

I tasted the white pearls in Palo Alto back when it was only offered in the Bay Area. I was converted instantly due to the healthier alternative (it's algae based rather than tapioca--healthier, but the consistency is a bit crunchier). After I found out that Gong Cha in NYC offers white pearls, I've just been going here.You might not like it, but I love it!"

My friend introduced me to one of the locations near her house, but that location closes on weekends. Therefore, here we were, enjoying our Saturday brunch. They have inside and outside seatings, but we preferred outside although the tables are close together. Here, you order inside and pay, then take your tray whenever you want to eat. I had DIY Hot Bowl (Moroccan Stew + Quinoa + Green vegetable). It was so delicious! I highly recommend the Moroccan Stew! My friend had the same stew but with something else. It looked great too. She even had a lemonade iced tea. She said the lemonade was not too sweet, which I would like. Next time! The Moroccan Stew was perfectly cooked. I loved it!"
1510,bbksGxuxO4FV1pa9urrzdA,8/23/2021,2 star rating,"I've passed by this place a lot from work and I was really intrigued by it especially since my partner is a vegetarian and I like taking him places where he can choose anything from the menu and this was one of the places that I wanted to take him to the most. The interior was really beautiful and I love they have a lot of seating options from inside, backyard patio, and outdoor street seating. They have countertop service so you can see the food and even create your own bowls if you like. The servers are very nice and willing to answer any questions we had. Since it was our first time we chose meals from the menu and got the lemonade, black tea, summer roll, spicy chili sin carne, and pasta bolo. The food looked really good but ended up being just average. The lemonade was not very sweet or tangy like regular lemonade. The summer roll was heavy in kale which is bitter and the other ingredients and dipping sauce didn't really help balance out the bitterness. The summer roll also spills out everywhere making a big mess too. The pasta bolo is just ok, there's not much flavor and the pasta is not al dente so there's no contrast of texture in the dish. The only thing that was alright was the spicy chili sin carne, but it still wasn't very spicy.All in all, it was a fun try and I really liked the ambiance of the restaurant, but the food really missed the mark in terms of flavor and did not satisfy our taste. If you're looking for a place with a healthy, vegan menu this is place is for you, but I wouldn't come back here. There are much better vegan restaurants out there!"

Whatever flavor that Tibetan mama sauce was, it completely drowned out my pickiness with veggies. Everything tasted so good! I also really liked the atmosphere and service.

My friend and I had a Full Therapy three bowl sampler;  Chili Sin Carne, Joe Smashed Potato (Mushrooms)  and the Cabbage bowl. All three were delish. I love mushrooms so I may have favored the Joe Smashed Potato. It had the essence of a French Bourguignon. We also had a side of Veggie Balls. They were tasty, but a bit dry. Looking back at the menu, I realized they forgot to give us the dipping sauce. They definitely need some sort of aioli. Looking forward to trying some more items next time I visit."

The food is shown out in front and u can pick and choose what vegan foods you would like. I got their most popular Tibetan Mama, summer roll and a glass of white wine. The food proportions are HUGE and I had a lot leftover to take home. The food was OK in my opinion, with a very raw veggie vegan taste, heavy on lentils and kale. Seasoning was minimal. The veggies definitely were fresh and vibrant. The summer roll was way too sour in my opinion since everything was pickled. It's not my style of food, but I can see why people would enjoy this."

1518,jVYyth-tq-o9o6T54oAWOA,2/8/2020,4 star rating,Absolutely delicious! We've been in the neighborhood for years and this was the first time we ordered for pick up. We were having a family gathering so we ordered the largest rice platter for our party of 9. The meats were tender and juicy. Rice was fluffy and the carrots added to the flavors. There was plenty of food for all of us and we even had leftovers. Highly recommend! The only point is the way they packaged the order. The platter was in a large aluminum tray and they did not line the bottom with cardboard and it made transporting to the car extremely tricky without burning my hands. It was like playing hot potato and having to change hands supporting the tray to not get burned.

However, I do take into consideration that This establishment seems more like a takeout place. However, the restaurant/sitting area is quite big. The prices were reasonable and the staff was friendly. We ordered the combo #1 Which was one chicken tikka, one lamb tikka, and one beef kofta platter. I was excited to see the sauce on the table, unlimited sauces! However, they served us the salad I tried the ""white sauce"" and it was ranch dressing. Bad ranch dressing. So I tried ""the hot sauce"" but it was ketchup. So disappointing. The only sauce that was authentic and edible was the spicy green sauce.The chicken was cooked pretty well, the lamb was extremely overcooked and dry, but the beef kofta was the best thing there. Unfortunately, there was no sauce. We asked them if they had ""white sauce"" and they said that's the white sauce on the table, and I said that's ranch dressing and they said ""that is our white sauce"".  The rice was cooked well but without white sauce, it made the entire meal unenjoyable. I ate less than half of my platter and I took it to go, took it home, added some sour cream and made it better. (I didn't have any Tzaziki or tahini)I don't think I will be going back."

The compliment of flavors is supreme. And the rice is the best thing about the restaurant.The service is actually great here and the max time to wait is around 10 minutes but they give you a little salad for the wait. I usually get the lamb tikka and chicken tikka over rice and the boolani and I like it every time I've been here. I took about 10 friends here and with the exception of 2, they all liked it. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five stars is because of the sauce. The white sauce tastes like ranch sauce and their green sauce is a bit spicy and I'm Korean (Koreans eat a lot of spicy foods). It's not your typical halal cart. But I think that that's the good thing about this restaurant. Oh and side note. There are a lot of muslims in this restaurant. So if you are a white supremacist or a trump supporter stay out..."

So I wanted to try everything I usually get plus the dishes they don't have at my usual place. I got the family combo, with lamb chops, mantoo, bolani, baklava, firni, and 2 mango lassies. All for $64.50. The mantoo and bolani were both very good, the other place doesn't have these two dishes. Also, I like that they have huge portions here as well. I gotta say the food here is good but there are differences. The green sauce here is spicy unlike the one at the other place, and they don't put a ton of carrots and raisins on the rice.  But I do like that they have appetizers and baklava!"

And that's saying a lot because this is the only a place my husband will eat. My husband is not a fan of afghani food and he loves this place. I've taken him to many, many Afghan restaurants and he just wasn't a fan till this place. The white sauce is aaamazing. The meat is perfectly seasoned, the rice nice and cumini (not a word I know). The service isn't the best but that's typical for places like these. For food this good I don't mind bussing my own table. In fact this is the only place I'll eat lamb. Usually lamb is too gamey for me. Not here though, its perfect here. No smell at all. And that crusty on the outside soft on the inside Afghan bread. Mmm so good. I'm always excited to go back."

The place didn't invest a lot in its decor. Looked like one of the many Indian restaurants in Jackson Heights. I guess it's suits their regular college/high school customer base. The prices are affordable compared to similar restaurants in the area. But the food itself is mediocre. For my first time visiting, I order their kofta/lamb/chicken kabab trio. They serve the dish with salad and bread. The salad was mainly lettuce and their bread was stale. The kababs itself were dry and not very flavorful and the rice was bland. Overall you're paying less for mediocre quality food."

The chicken and meat kebabs are amazing the bread is okay and the sauces are good. If you like spice and I mean spice you have to try the green sauce. I took my food to go but it looks busy for where the location. The place does need a little loving. There is a fan by the kitchen counter that needs some cleaning. Couldn't get my eye off that. But whatever the food is good and they also have this yogurt drink it's really good. I tried the mango one the strawberry pineapple mango is okay. My friends you know keep it tasty and let me know what you think.

They are open for pick up during quarantine so me and my 2 cousins (who are social distancing-together) made 3 separate orders for pick up. We walk in with face masks on of course and give him our name. He was so rude to us the whole time we were kinda in disbelief. He didn't even greet us. He literally THREW EACH of our cards to us on the table. I understand not wanting to hand us our cards (due to the virus) however throwing our cards on the table , one by one with a stank face was completely unacceptable. He could have handed it to us as everyone usually does or just simply placing it nicely on the table. (Did not even say thank you either). We didn't even ask for spicy mayo because as soon as he put the food on the table he walked away (again without a smile on his face , without a simple thank you, absolutely nothing) . I am currently working as well during this pandemic, I put on a smile every single day to customers . It's literally a huge part of your job.

I've been coming to Hangar for as long as I can remember!! Each time they out do themselves with excellent customer service, delicious food and most important EXCEPTIONAL FROZEN MARGARITAS!! Just yesterday they managed to steel my heart once again!!! With all the craziness going on with the virus and being stuck in quarantine, Hangar still made the effort to stay open and serve their customers. I was especially blown away by the fact that they were serving all of their alcoholic beverages TO-GO! Margaritas to go??? Sign me up!!! Now that's what I call- ""AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE""!!! Their food menu is incredible. To be honest with you, EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS!! I'm a big foodie and this place has never disappointed me!! No matter what you choose to order on that menu, I promise, you will be fully satisfied!! They also do themed nights which makes the place fun and always a great time. Can't wait to come back!!

It looks like the had a DJ booth in the back. Their menu is on a tablet. I ordered the Coors Light I came for and also went for the Hangrita (their version of a sangria with Hennessy). The serving size was crazy big. The waitress was nice and quick. I think I would come back to sample the food menu and the other cocktails."

1574,MMg42dFFw9r7KKroTX9xKQ,5/13/2017,4 star rating,"Came here with a friend this past Wednesday as it's close to where he lives and he mentioned they served up pretty decent food. Otherwise, it's largely your typical B&G but not too loud and the crowd was tame and not annoying. Our server/tender was very nice and humorous...but not in a goofy way.I ordered the Austin Burger w. fries and it was pretty good. The only complaint is that the basic bun they used couldn't quite hold up to the substantive meat and fixings but I didn't let that stop me from enjoying my burger. Plus, it didn't get in the way of the flavors of the combo.Unbeknownst to me, Wednesdays are trivia night (starting at 8pm) so we decided to opt in an have a go at it. It was a fun experience and it didn't hurt that we won on this night, so of course we now have to go back to do it all over again! Win, lose, or draw, I would have given the same rating. The trivia ""host"" was pretty cool and made it clear that no cheating would be allowed (i.e. no looking up answers on your smart phone).Beware this is Kew Gardens so expect to be patient when it comes to street parking, esp if you want to park up close to the venue. Def a spot to come back to again."

John did not greet us when we walked in, nor did he bother to take our order. Luckily, one of the barbacks' that recognized my boyfriend and I was able to take our drink/food order. After we received our drinks, John appeared only to force my boyfriend and I to leave a card on file, stating that it was POLICY to do so. When I mentioned to him that we've never had to leave a card on file, he again repeated that it was policy & that we had to. This left us feeling a bit uneasy, but we went along with it as we were just trying to watch the game and have a good time. Someone else sat on the bar right next to us, ordered with JOHN, and John never told the client they had to leave a card on file. I brought it up to John's attention and he said ""I haven't seen you before, and the reason why I ask for a card on file is because I've had people walk out without paying their tab before."" Not only did he go against the bars ""policy"" but he also insinuated that he did not trust we'd pay our bar tab. John never apologized when I brought it up to his attention. Lastly, to add insult to injury, ANOTHER couple sat to the left of my boyfriend and I and you guessed it, John NEVER told them they HAD to leave a card on file. Additionally, he never returned to us to ask us if we wanted additional drinks/food. As mentioned in the beginning, I've been here numerous times and I've never experienced the discriminatory behavior John demonstrated. Otherwise, the staff here is great, down to the barbacks. But, knowing someone like John works here really makes me question if I'd want to return to The Hangar again. Do better, JOHN."
1577,MMg42dFFw9r7KKroTX9xKQ,7/2/2016,4 star rating,"This is my neighborhood go to bar. Since I live so close I'm naturally inclined to visit here whenever I have a craving for wings. The wings here are always crispy and contain the right amount of sauce. Monday night is ""wing night"" so you can get a minimum of 10 for a good price. The hottest sauce available is called ""jet fuel"" and they are pretty spicy. The honey chipotle are very sweet if you are into that. The different wing flavor options are actually really good.  I'm a huge fan of the curly fries. The cocktails here are not that great, they have cute names but lack the right amount of alcohol. I've learned my lesson here: get a few beers or wine here.To get immediate service I recommend sitting at the bar, if you sit on the high chairs away from the bar, the servers are a bit slow about getting to you. When it's dead here the service is not great but on busy nights (Friday/Sat/Sunday) service is on point. If you watch UFC, Boxing or Soccer this is a fun place to watch the games/matches. The crowds are always in during these times. If you are looking to watch matches for free this s not the place there is usually a small fee to get in. Finally, one of major highlights of this bar is the jukebox. The jukebox here has top 40 popular songs which always put the customers in a good mood. The Hangers a good Kew Gardens spot. I recommend it if like a good atmosphere , beer and wings."
1578,ErMFay-6o83QB2P1k4ALAg,4/2/2022,2 star rating,Good for social boy for Fish and Chips Unfortunately...Came to White Oak Tavern based on the great reviews on Yelp! The customer service was great and they were attentive (usually negative reviews happen because of this) but the only tough situation was the amount of breading that was on the fish and chips... I try allot of authentic British Fish and Chips and must say I was disappointed especially after all of the good reviews. Overall I think this is a great place based on the socialization I saw by my food and my companion who had a $19 bacon cheeseburger was not the best... I would go back for the great customer service but stick to beer? Wine or drinks  unfortunately

But I have to say the best part was the amazing bartender, she was so friendly and appreciative of us not rushing her (which I think is the bare minimum someone can do on a very busy night)- I believe her name was Kendra (she was at the bar on opposite side of the entrance on Valentine's Day). She walked us through the happy hour menu and gave us awesome suggestions! I also really liked the vibe of the restaurant, it was so cozy and warm. I'd love to go back!"

The artichokes, pesto, gooey cheese, and warm bread is quite a combo. We also got some sweet potato fries. It came with a cocktail type sauce and a honey mustard sauce, both were delicious, but I enjoyed the honey mustard just a bit more. The fries were also the perfect combination between crispy and soft. The service was also great. Our server was able to get my friend the sangria even though it was no longer technically happy hour!"

Other bakeries are out in the open for anyone to grab i.e. less sanitary. You can bet that Manna House is the most sanitary. As for the actual taste, I had my go-to Chinese bun of the sweet topping bun with custard. it was good but a bit soft for my preference. I like the dough to be a bit denser. The service was friendly and though there are tables and chairs, they were all full."

We sat at a table in the back room with other larger parties, but there's a variety of seating arrangements available.We ordered the Hamachi Toro Roll and the Party Bomb Special to share, and our own drinks. I got the Passion Fruit Margarita, which tasted good. The sushi was nicely presented and a good variety of flavors. I wouldn't say I was super full from the meal, but it was a nice experience.

Not THE freshest but for the price, pretty good. I do remember the bluefin and ikura were very good. It's a nice in between quality and price range of wanting omakase and local sushi joint."

The rolls we ordered were so delicious- especially the AB roll. The flakes are a perfect touch and add just the crunch. The yellow tail party bomb could have expected more- it was simply the yellowtail on a pile of rice. I had slightly higher expectations for it but the yellowtail was sure good. Next time I'd probably get the party bomb, to get an even more variety of the fish but was just slightly disappointed with all the rice. The ambiance was great, just slightly dark for my taste."

The pork was tough, dry, and flavorless. I ate it anyway because I was so hungry. What a fool I was.- I went to bed a couple hours later and now you know where this is going....- Woke up at 1:00 AM and spent the rest of the night on the toilet instead of sleeping.

My family decided to do takeout yesterday and we ordered the Family Bomb for 4. Perfect size if you're only eating that. I was stuffed. What's a sushi bomb? A slightly varied and fun way of a roll but without seaweed. At least that's my definition. I ordered from their website, which in retrospect, calling would've been easier. If you order a large platter or any large order, the anticipated ""ready time"" may be the next day. I made a call just to verify that was a mistake and was assured my order was going to be ready in less than an hour, pheww."

We had made a reservation, but in an empty restaurant indoors there were only two tables they could offer us, that appeared clean and had cutlery, ""or sit at the bar"" they said. Um, hmm...They were out of stuff and told us after we already ordered. They served the steak with a large mound of rice instead of fries. Wat. Yuck. I guess some Chinese dishes have this combination, but it certainly didn't work at Bozu, and it certainly didn't work if you were expecting fries.The sushi bombs are great, I really do think it's some of the best sushi around, but my entree arrived like 20 minutes after my partner's steak. They said, para-phrasing here but also not really, ""we have a large party in the back and we're giving most of our attention to them."" My partner rolled his eyes. He runs a Michelin starred restaurant and told me, a bit irritated, that any restaurant should know to start with the smaller table first. And honestly, they should have comped something, but didn't. Oh, well, good sushi, but probably won't be back anytime soon, there's just too many other options."

There was no line when I stopped by and looked like folks were getting their food fairly quickly. But man could I have been more wrong. The second after I ordered, someone who worked at the airport came up to order a burger, and the person who was calling out the names and orders as they were ready  stopped what she was doing and helped this person for a full 15 minutes, completely forgetting about all the existing orders. The food just sat there getting cold, it's like she completely forgot about what she was previously doing. Then what I marveled at was that no one else went to start calling the orders and letting folks pickup their food. In fact another person went to a register and asked if anyone else wanted to order. Meanwhile there was a whole CROWD of us who had ordered on the kiosks in the waiting area just wondering WTH is going on. Utterly ridiculous. Now I've seen other gloomy workers before in fast food service but never like this. I get they are not happy working there but they seemed to take pleasure in just staring at all of us waiting. Thank goodness my gate was nearby or else I would've missed my flight. I did miss my boarding group sadly waiting 25min for ONE cold cheeseburger and then had to check my bag.

Ordered two drinks for $14. Handed over a $20 and the woman in the bikini totters off and then blanks me. Then starts talking to the guy at the bar next to me.

Shanghai Mong had all their menus displayed out in the front outdoor seating area and was beautifully lit. They had Jjampong and also Jjamja Myun which is 50/50 Jjampong and Jajangmyun which is usually my go-to. Since it was my first time ordering, I wanted to try just the jjampong. I walked in and was promptly greeted by the manager/owner boss lady and decided to order to-go. She took care of me promptly, I paid and waited outside for around 15-20 minutes. When I got home, I was shocked at how big the container was!! It was like a half-gallon plastic container, I kid you not. I actually transferred it into a glass tupperware and confirmed it was able to fill two entire 4-cup tupperware containers. So much seafood too! Mussels, clams, squid, and head-on shrimp. Flavorful broth and plenty of noodles. I ended up saving the broth and re-cooing it with other noodles/ingredients for the next 2-3 days.

1674,iQZYOzNB7b-vTF806dlbYA,4/3/2021,2 star rating,"TLDR: This isn't a place to enjoy good food. It's a place you come to when everything else is closed and you're hungry after a night out. I've been here twice. I did not review it the first time because I thought I came on an off day. Both times I ordered the jajangmyeon and both times I was disappointed. Its not TERRIBLE, but it certainly lacks flavor and the noodles didn't have any texture. It's not just the jajangmyeon; I've also had the mapo tofu, naengmyeon, and fried Shanghai dumplings. The mapo tofu was not spicy or flavorful, and the naengmyeon tasted watered down. The dumplings became soggy after a little bit because of a large amount of sauce poured over them. All of the sauces were thick and viscous. The major trend in each dish is a lack of texture and flavor. They kind of make up for this fact with portion size, but nothing to make you excited to return. If you're looking for good Korean food or food in general, I would go somewhere else. I would only return here if it was late night and I had no where else to go.They took our temperatures when we arrived, and there was hand sanitizer at the host booth. Service was a little slow, and they forgot one of our orders for 15-20 mins but nothing severely offensive. All in all, okay. I have an extra star because our waiter was nice."
1675,iQZYOzNB7b-vTF806dlbYA,8/16/2021,1 star rating,"Don't do it. You've been warned. Okay sure, you're thinking how bad can it be? It's not like this place averages one star. This is folly. It is precisely the naive attitude I had when I blithely walked in thinking we can get a decent meal.I ordered the vegetable dolsot bibimbap. It arrived in a stone pot that wasn't even hot. I literally picked it up because I was trying to determine how edible it was when there was a pool of oil at the bottom. The rice and majority of the vegetables were glistening with unnecessary oil. So much so that I wonder if this place will bankrupt itself using absurd amounts of oil on their food!The bean sprouts in my bibimbap were grey. Yes, grey, as in the same pallor of things that are dead and or decaying. The greens were mushy to the point I couldn't really identify what it was. Is it spinach? Is it weeds from sidewalk cracks? Who can say?Moving on to the bulgogi. Bleh. Yuck. Gag. It came out with thin shaved fatty meat that had zero flavor. How do you manage that? But they did get that grease puddle. It's a thing, apparently. Well, that was the closest to edible thing they served us. I was eating with a person who has no real ability to discern the quality and taste of food and even they were like wtf? How do you justify charging $19 for vegetable bibimbap and $34 bulgogi and fail to make it edible? With so many options nearby, don't do it. The insult to injury was the sour (in a bad way) kimchi. It's like what are they even doing back there to the food that flavor flees from it? Shame on you for serving bad kimchi! The $78 bill left the worst taste in my mouth!"
1676,iQZYOzNB7b-vTF806dlbYA,4/19/2021,3 star rating,"Average food but it'll suffice to satisfy your late night Korean cravings, especially if you've been drinking in the area beforehand. I came with friends after a visit to the bar and we were in the mood for a nice noodle fix. It was around 11pm at night and only a few other parties were inside with us. It says they are open 24/7 on Yelp but I'm pretty sure they actually close at midnight now. We ordered the black bean noodles and the spicy rice cakes to share. Both dishes were tasty to us because we were mildly inebriated and incredibly hungry, but neither were extraordinary. The jja jang myeon was saucy but I felt it lacked meat/veggies to thicken up the sauce and add more texture to the noodles. I enjoyed their rice cakes and felt they had a great chewy consistency but I wasn't sure if the portion size was worth the price.  Food came out pretty quickly but service was quite curt the entire visit. I'd say this is one of those late night options for when everything else is closed, but nothing to go out of your way for."

It was pretty packed, but luckily there was a table available for 3 when we passed by. There was only one dish I ordered, so I can only really comment on that and the service. I ordered the jjam jja myun, a combination of black bean noodles (jja jang myun) and spicy seafood noodles (jjampong). For $16, it was pretty worth it. I got a good amount of noodles for both. I liked the jja jang myun. There was enough sauce to cover all the noodles, plus a lot of meat and onions in the sauce, though I would prefer the onions slightly more cooked. The jjampong was a lot spicier than I could handle. I had to use the other noodles to fight off some of the spiciness. There was a good amount of seafood in the broth, with large prawns, small shrimp, mussels. Just with this dish, I was more than full.Good customer service. Even though we had slightly overstayed after we were done eating, the staff were really polite and kindly asked if we could make room for another customer. There was outdoor dining when I went. The tables are pretty close together, but they do have a transparent divider to separate them."

I used to work at a restaurants, so I know how busy it can get AND I know for a fact that you can change the time slots for delivery arrivals, on whatever website you're advertised on. But 8pm on a Tuesday?! Is 8pm on a Tuesday really ever busy? Is it? Is it ever busy? For one, this place  is 10mins by car & 20mins by public transportation. Did the delivery guy take the bus? Did the owner forgot to bless the food to become halal? Were they short staffed?? These are just a few of the never ending unanswered questions that I will forever hold in my heart.

Parking Tip: If heading towards Queens Blvd, park in the neighborhood immediately after you see the restaurant. Go down a bit and you should find a few spots there. For $10 you can literally feed 2 people especially with their great dinner specials. For example, Hunan Chicken with soup and an egg roll. Last time i came here we ordered the dinner for 8 which is more like dinner for 12. 2 types of soups, 3 different appetizers, and 8 entrees. The main issue was that it seems like all the dishes no matter how different the meat was, overlapped each other. It seemed like they just threw stuff together last minute and wa la. CASH ONLY -_-"

This is not typical ""Chinese food spot"" Chinese food like you would find only a few stores down. All their ingredients taste fresh. Their chicken is always amazing (I normally order the Hunan Chicken) and their fried rice is never too oily or greasy, same goes for the egg rolls. I like their Chicken Wonton soup as well, though it may not be for everyone. Overall, I love this place. I'll be going there as long as they're in business."

Not worth my money. The seafood soup is also lacking in flavor and seems to only have imitation crab as its ""seafood"" component- the rest of it is just an assortment of steamed vegetables.  Not worth my money. Steamed vegetables dish looks good, but how can you really mess up steamed veggies.. if I ever order from them again, I'll be sure to get a meat option and compare. Otherwise, delivery was speedy and portions are large. I'll just have to add my own seasoning to it, I guess!"

But I just had it today, and it was so atrociously bad food it was inedible. The meat in my pad Thai was frozen and thawed out, based on how chewy and dried out it was. The vegetables were not fresh. Some were just flat out dried out. The papaya salad had overripe, or maybe nearly spoiled papayas. I think they added extra spice to mask its turning. And the mussels my lady friend ordered were bland and not fresh either. It seems as though they're skimping on cheaper ingredients, or keeping them longer than they should, and it's really affecting the taste.  I literally had 4 bites and couldn't eat anymore."

I got them spicy thinking it wouldn't be that bad, but it actually built up and I needed to drink some milk (tea), but it was a good tasty kind of spice. Next, I ordered the lu rou fan and I kinda wish there was more braised pork.

It was packed inside and a lot of ppl waiting outside which is always good to see. My wife and I ordered the Fried Pork Chop Bian Dang, the Pork Dumpling, I couldn't resisist ordering Fried Chicken Sandwich with the shoestring fries. The fried pork was just amazing. Crispy on the outside and so juicy and flavorful on the inside. The garlicky cucumbers are a great add and just perfect. The pork dumplings were phenomenal. The homemade chili oil and sesame seeds added extra flavor on top of what's already rich. The fresh scallions and cilantro garnish takes it out of the park with a home run! I have to up my game with the way I prepare pierogis at home. After trying these dumplings I have some  new ideas which were inspired here. The fried chicken sandwich was the biggest one I've seen so far. Easily could have been cut in 2 and been two full sandwiches with an extra bun LOL... The chicken was super super crispy and so juicy inside. Come with an appetite because this sandwich is ridiculously good. I would add extra basil aioli and just dip it in! You have to try it! The shoestring fries were a pleasant surprise as to how skinny and tiny they are. The seasoning is just the perfect balance and they were super crispy! Watch out McDonald's lol Yumpling is in town hahaha. Will definitely come for the dumplings again! I also want to try the popcorn chicken and the sesame garlic noodles! I almost forgot about the drinks... You have to try the mango and lychee Taiwan Beers, they are packed with flavor!You won't be disappointed!!!"

If you like fried chicken sandwiches, then absolutely must try the one they serve here.  It's insanely delicious. First off, the piece of chicken in the sandwich is HUGE and very soft, juicy, and tender inside (not dried out like a lot of other places) which makes a big difference. It's served on a potato roll and topped with basil leaves, scallions, and a Basil Aioli.  To balance it all out I got a side dish of the garlicky cucumbers which were fresh, crunchy, and again: delicious. The staff are very friendly. There was initially a little mixup in the order, but I was given a few options on how to proceed and it was quickly rectified. They even offered extra food on top of my order in addition to a full refund (wow for service ), which I declined simply because of their overly gracious attitude and the fact the I love supporting small businesses in my neighborhood. There are a few tables inside the restaurant to eat in, but I just popped in with my dog to pick up my order for take out.  But I may try dining in at some point. It closes on the early side though (usually around 8pm), just wish it was open until later in the evening. Overall, I highly recommend trying out this Taiwanese restaurant. The fried chicken sandwich was incredible and they have a lot of other dishes that look great and I want to try so I'll definitely be coming back."

It actually is spicy. Sometimes their pork over rice is a bit salty. Staff is super friendly. And their pork chop would he better when eaten there. When I took it home it got a little soggy from the steam. The cold noodles is simple but good. Cucumbers I always love. Overall good place. Would definitely recommend here for Taiwanese takeout!

Then today, I went in for an iced chai. The guy being trained dumped about a half inch of cinnamon on the top of the ice. The owner basically watched him do it and said nothing. I figured it would be fine once I mixed it in. It was undrinkable. Very few times in my life (like fewer than four) have I brought / sent food back, but I brought this drink back, making sure not to blame the new guy, since it wasn't his fault. The owner, who was doing the training, apologized and made me a new one--no cinnamon on top (her apology is why the rating is two stars instead of one). Turns out, the chai mix itself is absolutely *loaded* with cinnamon, again, so much so that it's undrinkable. I had to throw it out and go somewhere else. Will not be going back."

The restaurant is very cute, small, and stylish. I appreciated the music and the decor for sure. I ordered a vegan sandwich with avocado, lettuce, tomato, cucumber and vegan cheese. I wanted to stick to the way the order was prepared (in a wrap) but due to dietary restrictions I couldn't. As I was trying to think of an alternate option, one of the servers offered the idea for me to get it as a bowl which I thought was pretty good given the circumstances. When my order was called it wasn't made clear that I wanted it to go which was fine. I had no problem waiting. What I didn't realize (not the employees) was that they didn't have to-go containers. After a couple minutes of searching, they asked if they could instead put the salad, into two soup containers. Of course, I said yes because I had no option since I had to leave. When the salad was brought to me, it was in ONE, 16 oz soup cup. Yes, you read correctly. A ""full salad"" in a soup cup. I cannot believe this was something they even thought was a good idea. The green goddess dressing was good, I will say that but honestly, I just can't believe I was given SALAD in a soup cup. Yes. A picture is attached here so you all can see. I will definitely never be returning."

Although, luckily roots has provided a service where elderly couples such as my grandparents receive snacks, coffee, and quarantine essentials. It is truly an amazing deed that this restaurant is doing for the community.Now I don't really give many 5 star reviews but for a restaurant that helps my grandparents in a time where they can't live their normal lives is heart warming.

I normally have a dinner that includes soup appetizers jock as well as an entrée depending upon the number of people in your party. But the duck is the best.

I was excited to go but I was a bit disappointed. We ordered Peking duck dish and sauteed bean string.Here's what I liked:Service: very good. All servers were very nice. They patiently waited and explained the menu when we asked for recommendations. They recommended to get peking duck and a vegetable dish. They were attentive and efficient. We requested to change seat because we were in corner seat. They quickly changed our seat and moved all our utensils and dishes.Cleanness: restaurant was clean overall. Floor was clean. All dishes and utensils were clean.What I didn't like:Dish: I have been to lots of chinese restaurant and have tried many peking duck. Meat was so dry. Portion was small. This was the smallest ""whole duck"" I have ever had. This is size of half duck. I don't think quality and portion worth 65 dollars.Cleanness: the napkin dropped so much lint. I was wearing black colored clothes. It was very unpleasant.Hope this review helps!"

Very bad experience!This place is way too over priced and over hyped. First  off the food is totally sub par and there are other places that serve the same dish ""Peking duck"" that taste a lot better, fresher and way cheaper. Everything else we ate, the fried rice and dumplings and whole fried fish were all not good, no taste and really kinda bland. The service was also very slow and inattentive. THEY charge automatic 18% gratuity and it was just me and wife eating, not a party of 6. I guess they don't care to service to much since they slap on the auto gratuity. In addition, We sat near an un-bussed table the whole time with old food and plates still lingering. This place is truly awful from Service to food to the auto grat on the bill! Do yourself a favor do not go here for anything! The food kinda sucks ! Besides there are a million other places on that block that are way better !"

Thought it would be some small mom and pop shop but it was a rather large and fancier than expected duck house. We had a party six and were seated within 10 minutes sans reservations. Ordered a few dumplings which were very tasty. One whole duck was ordered. It came out after a while whole on a platter and was presented to us and then taken by the waiter and carved in front of us.This was a good duck I must say. Very crispy skin, tender, good flavour, some part were a bit fatty but expected as it is a duck.The staff was very friendly and my daughter was even able to practice Mandarin with our head waiter. i would return here again."

The spot was lively but had reservations on a Friday night and it was recommended from a friend. None of us wanted leftovers and the portions looked huge, so we opted for a mix of apps. I tried the vegetable dumplings, cold sesame noodles, and scallion pancake. Portions were bigger than expected on everything. The dumplings didn't have too much flavor. Scallion pancake was pretty good but not super memorable, and it was thicker than I've had before. The sesame noodles were probably the best--the peanut sauce had tons of flavor and the cucumber was refreshing in this otherwise heavy dinner. Prices are a bit higher than the expected cheap prices of Chinatown but that's because this is a proper dinner restaurant. Service was very quick and they were good about filling waters. I will probably come back with the friend who recommended it so I can make the most of it!"

No signage outside or huge noticeable presence but the Fleur de lis let me know I was in Cajun country. Total BONUS was that they had the game on WITH SOUND in the back room on a huge projector!!! They also do this for Saints games, I've been told. The bartenders are extremely friendly and attentive. And I, of course, being the good Southern girl I am, asked everyone around me about the food. Two girls I met watching the game suggested the poboys were really good. The gentleman next to me said he didn't enjoy the jambalaya. The bartender- overhearing this conversation decided to bring me some to try- FOR FREE. I was blown away by the kindness and concern over how one feels about the food. And honestly, it was pretty good. It had the right texture and the trinity of foods we use to cook. I would definitely have it again. I will say this, the menu is Cajun inspired. The owners spent time in Louisiana and love the city and it shows in the hospitality and feel of the bar. This place reminds you of much of New Orleans dives that have great beer prices, TVs, comfort food and a pool table. I will definitely be back. Ps... a beer and a shot is $6. Great price when you're on a budget."

It has a projector displaying football on Sundays for all the sportz fans, a full bar, high-top table/bar seating in the front, and additional seating in the back of the bar. Great for brunch, which is what my group and I went for. As soon as we sat we were immediately offered a free Coors pitcher since they were sponsoring the game, um...yes, please!  After accepting a refreshing pitcher of Colorado cool-aide we ordered. I got a blood maria (tequila) and the boys got beermosas (oj and miller high life (clever)) we were in lust! Let's dive in! For starters, we ordered: deviled eggs (2 orders), crispy pork belly cracklin', cheesy crawfish bread, and crawfish mac n' cheese. Well, everything was so yummy, the crawfish bread was so different, not too fishy, it was on the soupy side, which I enjoyed, lots of flavors, not too overpowering you still get that authentic taste; it all went. The cracklin' well that was crack, it's didn't even stand a chance on the table we devoured it (even dipped it in the crawfish sauce - HW make that a dish please). The deviled eggs were standard not out of this world, but still good. The crawfish mac was a slight disappointment, it wasn't too cheesy at all, which is the whole allure of the dish and the herbed breadcrumbs, were just there; it felt a little incomplete. BTW these are all small portions split between 3 people, some of the dishes are pictured. BRUNCH: I got the dirty hash (potatoes, pork creole sauce, fried eggs, and a biscuit), one person got the crispy catfish po' boy, and another got lucky Lubbock (eggs, chicken fried pork steak, biscuit, sage sausage gravy). My dish was good it had a little bit of everything, but def, not overwhelming, it was actually smaller than I thought, which was fine, since we'd been trying most of the snack menu. The creole sauce was okay not as spicy as I imagined, but overall it was a safe dish. I head the po' boy was delish, but the lucky Lubbock was not enough for my boy, it was the smallest of the three and not the most filling; decent but great. Unfortunately, the biscuits were not hot (temperature) or as flakey as I would have liked. *Overall the portions are smaller than they looked in the pictures, just beware when ordering. We had a great time, we ordered a few rounds of drinks, tried a good bit of their menu, and didn't feel rushed (drinks were on the slow side to come out). The check was decent for three people; I recommend this spot for sure, I'd like to go back and try dinner one day!"

I loved the cheesy grits and mushroom gravy, the pork belly was pretty good too. The eggs were super under cooked and biscuit was stale.

I buy food for myself here often. I buy food for visiting family from here. I'll buy food for my future beau from here too. This is the spot to come to for home-cooked, somebody-is-throwing-down-type cooking. I appreciate it. Everything I've had here has been delicious. My favs are the escovitch fish, curry chicken, jerk wings, mac-n-cheese and oxtail gravy on whatever I get that doesn't have gravy with it.  The plantains when they haven't run out are delicious and the rice and peas and cabbage are as well. I've also had cowfoot and chicken soup from here as well. Super tasty and comforting.  Don't even get me started on the patties. Basically, this is the spot.

The total came out to be $15 but most options there are $10.I throughly enjoyed my meal here. The rice and beans were perfectly cooked, and had a touch of seasoning which most places lacked.

1765,VHORZQg5A3YNBptRN92QGg,5/19/2017,4 star rating,"Not your fancy type of place. This is pretty much a bare-bones operation. You order your food, pay, and leave. The restaurant has two small tables but typical people are waiting for their food. Actually, I do not know if ""restaurant"" is a correct word, maybe it's more of an indoor food stand. The food is pretty cheap, $8 bucks for an entree with two sides (typically rice&beans with something else). On my visit, I ordered jerk chicken with rice & beans. The food was pretty good, because the jerk chicken had just about the right amount of kick for me. Maybe the chicken was just prepared but it was so juicy (some Caribbean places will give you the driest piece of jerk chicken that they can find). You get quite a deal because the portion sizes are HUGE!!! I could not finish all of my rice and beans. This place is perfect for someone who is on a budget because a large entree (around 13) bucks would be enough food for two feedings. The service is quite typical of these in and out establishments. Do not go in there expecting a friendly smile. Like, I said earlier: you order, pay, and leave . . . there is no time for random chit chat."

I don't do takeout often, as I love to cook and generally eat out when actually going out; however, when I discovered this restaurant and how well grandma or whomever is cooking back there coupled with the way reasonable prices, it was a wrap. I buy food for myself here often. I buy food for visiting family from here. I'll buy food for my future beau from here too. This is the spot to come to for home-cooked, somebody-is-throwing-down-type cooking. I appreciate it. Everything I've had here has been delicious. My favs are the escovitch fish, curry chicken, jerk wings, mac-n-cheese and oxtail gravy on whatever I get that doesn't have gravy with it.  The plantains when they haven't run out are delicious and the rice and peas and cabbage are as well. I've also had cowfoot and chicken soup from here as well. Super tasty and comforting.  Don't even get me started on the patties. Basically, this is the spot. The line is out the door at times, but it moves quickly and it's always worth the (brief) wait."
1773,v2dtG37r1ThqtfEfiFsAUg,1/23/2021,5 star rating,"Highly recommend Pattie Hut & Grill. I tried the oxtail, rice and peas, plantains, and macaroni pie. The oxtail and rice and peas were so rich and flavorful (with the perfect hint of sweetness/spice), and the macaroni pie had a nice crispy top, which I love. Plantains were delicious as well. The portions are generous- I ate a ton but still have plenty of leftovers! Already looking forward to coming back."

I've been a fan of Jamaican cuisine for a while and the area i'd lived in before didn't offer many options, so I was excited to try this place out.I ordered the large box, with rice and beans and oxtail stew, which came with the side of the day, fried sweet plantains. The total came out to be $15 but most options there are $10.I throughly enjoyed my meal here. The rice and beans were perfectly cooked, and had a touch of seasoning which most places lacked. The oxtail was had more heat to it then I'm used to at other places, but i thought it was very complex and flavorful.Overall i really enjoyed the food here! I will be returning in the future and encourage others to try out this place"
1775,v2dtG37r1ThqtfEfiFsAUg,5/19/2017,4 star rating,"Not your fancy type of place. This is pretty much a bare-bones operation. You order your food, pay, and leave. The restaurant has two small tables but typical people are waiting for their food. Actually, I do not know if ""restaurant"" is a correct word, maybe it's more of an indoor food stand. The food is pretty cheap, $8 bucks for an entree with two sides (typically rice&beans with something else). On my visit, I ordered jerk chicken with rice & beans. The food was pretty good, because the jerk chicken had just about the right amount of kick for me. Maybe the chicken was just prepared but it was so juicy (some Caribbean places will give you the driest piece of jerk chicken that they can find). You get quite a deal because the portion sizes are HUGE!!! I could not finish all of my rice and beans. This place is perfect for someone who is on a budget because a large entree (around 13) bucks would be enough food for two feedings. The service is quite typical of these in and out establishments. Do not go in there expecting a friendly smile. Like, I said earlier: you order, pay, and leave . . . there is no time for random chit chat."

I got an $8 medium jerk chicken combo, actually fairly large, with rice and peas and cabbage. They offer gravy for the rice, and I opted for chicken curry, which sort of operates as a sample of a whole other entree."
1778,F6bHxGnfVzI1SEqWYLeIkg,7/5/2019,4 star rating,"This place is adorable and an awesome date spot in Dumbo! Service was great, and the food was pretty solid. We ordered the mussels and burrata for appetizers. For entrees, we got the halibut and duck breast. Everything was delicious, especially the duck. It was cooked just right and the skin was crispy, giving it a nice smokey flavor. Halibut was overcooked though, so it was a bit dry. My girlfriend absolutely loved their drinks. I think it's a tad on the pricier side, but given the location, it's to be expected. The total for 2 drinks, a soda, and the food was around $200 after tip/tax."

Nice open space and simple but cute decor, I became excited for the food based on the ambiance.I tried their lobster rolls and they were quite delicious. I mean how could it go wrong with lobster rolls? Portion size was rather small but since I had a late breakfast, it was just right for me.I got to taste smoked salmon sandwich and they were quite good as well.Good service and good location. I enjoyed a nice stroll by the bridge after lunch."
1780,F6bHxGnfVzI1SEqWYLeIkg,8/4/2019,4 star rating,"The service at Atrium is really great. We were initially seated on the first floor by the kitchen but the host was extremely accommodating when we asked to be seated on the second floor instead. Our waiter was also very helpful with recommendations and our party's dietary restrictions as well. We ordered shakshuka ($17), scrambled eggs ($17), and buttermilk fried chicken and waffles ($23). The tomato sauce in the shakshuka was pleasantly spicy and the charred kale was a good accompaniment to the scrambled eggs. The chicken and waffles, which came with applewood smoked bacon, were my least favorite. The chicken was dry and the bacon lacked a crispiness that would have complimented the waffles. Despite the subpar chicken, our overall experience was quite nice and the service is great. I'd definitely return for lunch or dinner if I'm in the area."

1782,F6bHxGnfVzI1SEqWYLeIkg,1/13/2018,4 star rating,"My little brother recommended Atrium to me for brunch. Being that it is located right in the middle of DUMBO and from the pictures, I thought the vibe would be fancier. However, it wasn't as appealing interiorly as I had hoped. I made reservations for 2 on a Saturday through OpenTable and it was a smooth process. Service here is wonderful, our waitress kept coming around to make sure everything was okay. My friend got the Chicken and Waffles and I got the Steak and Eggs that my brother spoke so highly of. The steak was DELICIOUS - very juicy, just the way I like it but everything else on the plate was eh. The side salad could've had a better dressing, the potatoes were kinda plain and the egg had no seasoning! My friend said while his chicken and waffles were good, he's had better. Final verdict? For the price of the food, I don't think it was worth and would probably pick another brunch place. The drinks were great though, I loved my ginger and blood orange mimosa and my friend loved his grapefruit collins."

I highly recommend giving the tea and kalamansi cocktail a try.For food, I enjoyed the mussel appetizer and duck breast entree. Dipping the complimentary toasted and garlicky bread into the mussel's butter sauce was divine. The duck breast entree was very tender and flavorful."
1784,F6bHxGnfVzI1SEqWYLeIkg,2/8/2017,4 star rating,"Had an amazing time here years ago during a Yelp elite event. Spacious, industrial but green decor featuring dim lights, high ceilings  and a captivating vertical garden. Great place for group celebrations.My 2nd encounter here occurred on a week night. We were one of the last people who came in to dine. Same fun and intimate ambiance. Started out with their cocktail list, ordered the Tea and Kalamasi (sweet bourbon based cocktail) and my husband got the special of the night, a refreshing drink similar to the cucumber & Agave. Really enjoyed my drink, not too sweet or too tart, refreshing but leaves an impact.On to food. The pie mussels that we shared as an app had a good sauce. Few of the mussels weren't that fresh. Medium size. We then ordered the Wild stripped bass and Long island duck. The bass was alright but came with pretty much no sides ""endives and emulsion"". The duck was not much to talk about either. Upon review, we should have went with the organic chicken. Service was very professional. Our waitress kept checking in on us frequently.Overall, great place to come for an app or drink. Great mixologist. Would certainly return knowing their wine list has won awards.....Hit or miss for dinner.  For the prices they charge, that's not a risk I'd take again.

(Cute little pillows on the benches and what not.)The service is a bit slow, but nothing too obscene.The Fried Chicken Sandwich was very good, and so were the potato chips that came with it. The biscuits were dry and tough, and the Frozen Pineapple Coconut cocktail was overly sweet but very strong. Overall, I think it was a bit overpriced and the food was just OK."
1786,F6bHxGnfVzI1SEqWYLeIkg,4/21/2019,2 star rating,"Very very underwhelming experience at Atrium. Came here for a lunch with four of my friends. There was no wait to sit and we got a great table upstairs. Got our drink orders in and sat for about 40min waiting for our food. Everyone got antsy waiting for the food and listening to a child scream at a table behind us. I got an angus burger for $21 with a tiny patty about 2/3rd size of the bun. It was over salted and extremely dry so I had to keep dipping it in hot sauce to make it taste better. And a few tasteless and dry potato wedges on the side which looked like a single sloppily sliced potato. Maybe if I added toppings like cheese, avocado and bacon at $2 each it would taste better but I still don't think it'd justify it to be an over $20 burger. Mediocre food at high prices -- will def skip next time I'm in Dumbo. I'd rather spend the same amount on a GREAT meal.Had a fun time with friends though so a major star for that."

For those who don't know, Paris Baguette is a heaven for someone who loves French-inspired desserts as well as pastries with a Korean twist to makes them lighter and less rich. They have goodies from a chocolate chip cookie, and sticky buns to strawberry shortcakes and coffees too. You pick up a tray, grab anything you like, and eventually find a spot to sit down and enjoy or take to go, it's all good."

I really like the raspberry fruit pastry because it was the perfect amount of sweetness. The raspberries didn't taste unfresh/old either. The chai latte was good, but I do wish it was a bit sweeter. It seemed like there was very mininal amount of sugar added into it and mainly milk. So, if you would rather have a drink that isn't too sweet, I would recommend the chai latte.Overall, I had an amazing experience here and would definitely come back if I am in the area."

1831,fUcjBGgmTlvxXn2azvAijw,10/27/2020,2 star rating,Man do not order lattes here. I wondered why they asked if I wanted cinnamon or sugar in it. No I don't want you to ruin it thanks. Got it and a bacon egg and cheese on a roll.Left.Block or two away took a sip. Lord they boiled it! This isn't some skunk hot coffee! You don't boil lattes! It's espresso and steamed milk. Neither should be boiling!Burnt tongue and part of mouth. Tossed latte. Then I realized with horror... they probably burnt the bacon on the sandwich too! People burn bacon and then wonder why they get cancer. I checked and sure enough it was charred hockey puck pieces. Well least the homeless guy I handed it to got a meal out of it

Their coffee, pastry, and chicken wrap all hit home.  The blueberry yogurt muffin was the most moist muffin I've come across in a loooong time."

1834,fUcjBGgmTlvxXn2azvAijw,1/31/2019,5 star rating,"Best Bacon Egg and Cheese sandwich around.They crack real eggs, none of that pre-beaten-carton mix that everyone uses due to ease, and they fry the eggs perfectly. Not to mention it is real, bona-fide gridled bacon, none of that deep fried, dark, chewy as hell deli bacon that you find on deli sandwiches.Their iced coffee is quite good, and their baked goods are likewise delicious. I had a maple scone there that was the perfect mixture of crumbly but not dry.The cafe is huge, tons of seating and wifi. Highly recommended for a place to go, eat, drink, and work!"

1837,fUcjBGgmTlvxXn2azvAijw,6/29/2019,5 star rating,"Some of my favorite spots to eat always happens on a whim.  I was in the neighborhood looking at my Yelp's recommendations when this was one of the places to go.  Read one of the comments that it had bearclaws and I? Wait, bearclaws? That's all I needed to see. Of course when I've arrived the cafe didn't have any, and my broken-hearted self didn't want to leave empty handed.  Think I'll try the French Toast, bacon and eggs.  No cap, as the youth in NYC would say, that was the best French Toast I've tried in years. Let me try one more dish before I give my rating.The next day, ordered an Mexican Omelette and because I used my head that day, called in advance to save the bearclaw for me.  It was the last one *shimmy* This breakfast hit the spot again.  2 for 2.  I'm sold and everyone here was nice and friendly.  Say no more."

The staff are very polite and the store is cleaner than any other chicken store I have ever seen. I would have given it 10 stars but since 5 is a max then that's what they deserve.

I first noticed it on pieces of chicken, which became pieces of lettuce, which became chipotle sauce, and noticed that it was even on the edges of my bowl! I am completely disappointed and repulsed at the thought of a worker's hair in my stomach, and I have never experienced this at any other Chipotle, much less any other restaurant before. I will not be returning."
1841,nqXvLzqzQQTJ2eMPkAcojw,4/6/2021,1 star rating,"I barely write reviews, but this experience is so bad that I have to: this Chipotle is hot garbage. For the 2nd time in 2 weeks, the workers refused to take in person orders and said everyone had to make an online order instead. Why? Because they are understaffed.The owner is more concerned about maximizing profits and working his understaffed team to death instead of hiring an extra person or 2 to meet demand. Very sad.To the owner of this location: WHY ARE YOU UNDERSTAFFED AND WORKING YOUR CURRENT TEAM TO THE BONE? Hire more people. Everyone knows this location does well enough to afford it (you guys provide a 3/4 filled cup of joke guacamole at almost $3 a pop. Cmon be real.)This is a sad excuse for a Chipotle location. Get this business together before people have had enough. Sad. VERY SAD!"
1842,nqXvLzqzQQTJ2eMPkAcojw,8/14/2021,1 star rating,"I specifically made a Yelp account to leave this Chipotle 1 star. Not exaggerating. Horrific. Service has been a joke numerous times. Half the time they operate via online orders only and when I show up to pick up the food, they make eye contact with me through the locked glass door and don't acknowledge me or the other 5 people waiting. Orders are usually late. Has happened a few times. The place also just operates whenever they feel like it. Want to close 6 hours and 27 minutes early today? Sure! No consistency. Why even put hours on your door? Place is brutal. Go elsewhere."

I walked into this place and 4-5 people behind the counter didn't even acknowledge my presence for about 5 minutes (and the place was empty!). I should have walked out right then and there, but I've worked fast food before and know that not everyone is on it all the time. Then a woman walked up and took my order: 9 hard-shell tacos with steak. She proceed to just throw the ingredients all over the container, cracked some of the tacos; and the tacos that were on the bottom she didn't even hardly place any ingredients into. And when I told her to please be careful, she speeded up the awful job she was doing, slid the bag towards me and walked away without saying a word. Unreal! She should be happy that she even has a damn job! I'll NEVER, I repeat, NEVER go to this Chipotle ever again."

The crab rangoon was very light, crispy, and not overly greasy - it melts in your mouth! You can get a table here even on a Saturday night with no reservation since the restaurant is huge. Also, the service is very quick! We got all of our food & drinks within 30 minutes. Finally, the best drink is the mojito lychee! Not too strong or too sweet.

Got pineapple fried rice with chicken and another one with crab and their Japanese style fried chicken in bun. The ambience has changed slightly however be careful because in one of the bathrooms there was boiling hot water that almost burnt my hands so had to use the other bathroom for a mix of hot and cold water I almost got locked in the bathroom as the twist lock on the door wasn't turning properly a small panic moment but over all great vibe, fast service, and good food!"

The thai ramen was quite an interesting taste! I really liked it. Noodles were cooked to perfection for both dishes. The only complaint I have is that the service was a bit lacking. Server was quite curt in taking our orders and they did not check in with us at all during out meal. It was also difficult to flag them down to request things.

Absolutely amazing!It was dark in there but the music was great! Service was weird, we barely got served & when we did get served, the lady accidentally spilled 4 drinks all over our party and on our belongings. Also, when they were cleaning the spill, the waitress left a hot pot of tea on a chair without telling anyone & forgot it was there and my mother sat on it almost burning her! After that incident, we definitely we got more attention from the staff.Service was ehh, but the food was great. It was a weird dinner after that, but I would go back to try other foods there."

I absolutely loved the green curry - the flavors were so well blended and it is very spicy (if you ask for it to be spicy). The crab rangoon was very light, crispy, and not overly greasy - it melts in your mouth! You can get a table here even on a Saturday night with no reservation since the restaurant is huge. Also, the service is very quick! We got all of our food & drinks within 30 minutes. Finally, the best drink is the mojito lychee! Not too strong or too sweet. The strawberry satho is also very refreshing!"

The location on the upper East side is great surrounded by other cute spots and a couple of blocks from Central Park. We ordered their veggie spring rolls which are amazing and so crispy. The beef pad Thai was delicious. Got their spicy tuna over sticky fried rice which was so good. The fried tofu was great too. Got pineapple fried rice with chicken and another one with crab and their Japanese style fried chicken in bun. The ambience has changed slightly however be careful because in one of the bathrooms there was boiling hot water that almost burnt my hands so had to use the other bathroom for a mix of hot and cold water I almost got locked in the bathroom as the twist lock on the door wasn't turning properly a small panic moment but over all great vibe, fast service, and good food!"

The food was all very good as well. The spicy miso ramen was maybe a 4/10 spicy (to our taste) but they have sambal upon request for my fellow spice lovers. The thai ramen was quite an interesting taste! I really liked it. Noodles were cooked to perfection for both dishes. The only complaint I have is that the service was a bit lacking. Server was quite curt in taking our orders and they did not check in with us at all during out meal. It was also difficult to flag them down to request things. Would definitely recommend for their ramen.

We were seated immediately. our server was prompt and polite. The service was pretty quick and it could also be because it was less crowded. The restaurant has a casual modern vibe. The menu is extensive and boasts of various Thai dishes and sushi."

Good amount of lychee (even if likely canned.) The other person had the Milo Volcano Bingsoo which had milo powder, oreo crumbs, chips ahoy, cereal, marshmallow, whipped cream, and a chocolate sauce on the side. Good mix of stuff with a lot more textures so I liked it more. Cash only as noted and hidden below an izakaya on a busy street. Someone had a drink which they liked. Good little spot."

My friend and her husband shared the sweet layers choco which is essentially ice cream with Oreo chips and marshmallows. They enjoyed it. We will be back!

Came with a small scoop of ice cream. The flavors were inserted into the toasts. I liked the Pandan one better than the Thai Tea because I really didn't get too much Thai Tea flavor.Definitely a place to stop by after eating at the many different restaurants in the neighborhood to continue the stuff yourself till you burst behavior."

Looks just like all the other pictures people posted, so we dug right in and didn't bother snapping another picture. The bingsoo was perfectly soft and fluffy.

The lady running the shop was by herself and so sweet.It's a small place, maximum seating is maybe 12-15 tightly. CASH only.We only came for the bingsoo and toast, but got a bonus of 2 free drinks since we came during happy hour."

The toast is sooo crispy and crunchy. It was so good I got another one to go. By the time I got back home it was still nice and crunchy. I also ordered their mango bingsu which is also delicious! I like how they put condense milk and mango syrup on the side so you can add it yourself to your own liking."

I'd recommend going here only once in a while because their ice cream is so rich it probably has more fat/calories than you entire dinner times 2! Either way, their ice cream is worth the splurge. They use silly names for their creations but my favorite is the 'strawberry blonde' which has graham crackers and caramel mixed in. My wife loves the 'chocolate devotion' which has fudge brownie and chocolate chip pieces. If you reeeeeealy want to indulge and have regrets later you should get their 6 pack of cupcakes. I tried the 'cake batter deluxe' and was in heaven for a few minutes....until the button on my pants popped off (dramatization, but you get where i'm coming from).This particular Cold Stone in Sheepshead Bay gets very busy on the weekends because it's next to a movie theater and TGI Friday's and attracts everyone from those locations and other places in the area. So good, yet so bad! Enjoy the sugary goodness of Cold Stone."

After another 20 minutes, Someone finally arrived and put on the open sign. Well they weren't in fact open and the stone in the Cold Stone was not cold.  He asked me to please wait another 15 minutes while he set up and prepared the stone.  I gave them  25 minutes and reentered the store still anxious to get my ice cream. The person took my order and then took another 5-7 minutes to put the add-ons in order and wipe down the counter. When he finally made my order, the Stone was still not cold and it became a melted mess. I was so upset by the whole thing that I just wanted to walk out but since I had waited so long, I didn't all that time wasted so brought it home and shoved it in the freezer. In the end it tasted ok but was not worth the whole ordeal. I went there because this one has parking as opposed to the other location. Don't let the free parking fool you!  The unprofessionalism and unpreparedness will frustrate you."

I also ordered a chimichanga off menu which was in the top 5 I've ever had.  I was a little drunk during dinner, but remember absolutely housing that thing. Two things about this place. Their signage is honestly pathetic.  Comic Sans font? Really? How can someone own a restaurant in the restaurant capital of the city, in the restaurant capital of the country, and not understand curb appeal?  Also, chips and salsa are 4 dollars a basket? Common now. Nickel and diming customers is not the way to get people to come back.Overall very happy with my meal and will be back for another changa."

Most Mexican restaurants give you complimentary chips and salsa while waiting for your meal .  But no this place charges you and not cheap .   I've overlooked that though and got over it .  But tonight was the last straw ! I will not be going back and neither will my friends .  I ordered drinks , I ordered the expensive chips and salsa and I ordered dinner . While drinking and eating the chips and salsa I got only half way through the chips and ran out of Salsa . It's only a small bowl about 2 tablespoons of Salsa.  So I asked for more Salsa to finish my chips .   They brought another 2 tablespoons of Salsa and had the nerve to charge me for it !  The owners of this place should be ashamed!    Disgusting that this place is so cheap that they are charging for additional tablespoons of salsa !  What's next ? Charging for the water and napkins !  I will make sure everyone hears about this , especially all my friends that thought this was their favorite place !  Well guess what ... there are other Mexican restaurants.

1927,6kxVXIjqxCe4bJsFIrVfZA,1/13/2017,1 star rating,Very bad customer at this particular store. Went to them yesterday morning for some oatmeal and tea and a protein pack. I asked for a shopping bag to carry my food since it was a take out order. The cashier stated I may not anymore bags. I asked can he check.  He made an attempt to act like he looked for one. I then asked were there any in the back. He then stated I don't think so. He then he yelled out to the Manager Barbara asking were there any bags. She then was rude in answering if you don't see any then there is none!  She didn't even attempt to look in the back. So I asked so I'm to walk outside in the street with a cup of oatmeal and the protein pack and a cup of tea. The manager then snapped back to me saying I don't have any bags. I was so surprised of the bad customer service that was happening and another customer that was in the store also commented that was rude. To think that this brand would not have supplies in there store and to make sure your customers are happy. On top of this whole  situation I have a Aunt who works for the corporate office of Starbucks and who deals directly with Mr Schultz each day.  I know that I will not return back to this particular store due to the disrespect of the manager who should set the example for her team.  It's a shame. I'm also going on my social media channels to let people know about this store and the bad service they do there.

I then asked were there any in the back. He then stated I don't think so. He then he yelled out to the Manager Barbara asking were there any bags. She then was rude in answering if you don't see any then there is none!  She didn't even attempt to look in the back. So I asked so I'm to walk outside in the street with a cup of oatmeal and the protein pack and a cup of tea. The manager then snapped back to me saying I don't have any bags.

It looked like there was only one person serving/taking orders/pouring drinks and she was always running around, never a moment of rest.  We felt really bad bothering her so it took a while to move things along but it was totally not her fault.Great place to get a healthy meal that doesn't leave you feeling bloated but don't be in a rush while you're here.

Flavorful breakfast sandwiches that are a great break from regular egg and cheese bagels, and fairly generous portions. But unfortunately, the quality and taste of the food has been pretty inconsistent. I even hesitated writing a review until now because I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt. Buuut...we got an order this morning and my sandwich was dry, bland and an add-on was missing. Same thing for my partner. In the past, the bread has been burned, or main ingredients were missing. It's a shame because the food really can be great, I'm just not sure if I'll end up with a delicious meal or something more disappointing when I order."

There were multiple human hairs - full strands - where I pulled them out and just ew.. I called immediately to tell them and they offered to remake my sandwich, but I'm sorry - that's super gross. I will not be returning. I took one bite of my second sandwich and couldn't keep it in my mouth. The thought of hairs got me too queasy."

Also, champagne in a can. Can-pagne, if you will."

It's not going to do well. Especially since everyone in the bar/restaurant industry knows that one of the owners does in fact own that building and he was the one to raise the rent 500% when Cain's lease ended. (It's not a fictional number)That doesn't sit very well with the folks that live here...at all. We all remember Williamsburg fondly but the truth is they had a huge role in turning Williamsburg into the ""Ventricle of Douche"" which I've stated in my Whiskey Bk review.

There are a couple of regulars I've chatted with that seem so down to earth. Carl and Ash are super welcoming too. Ash makes the jokes and popcorn. Carl made me a funny ""reserved"" sign for my usual corner seat haha. They're great! Also all the grilled cheeses are pretty awesome too.

This bar is repulsive on so many levels. It's a big tv sports bar, crammed into a tiny space. The bartenders are bursting to show how super nice and cool they are but it's gross.  People new to the neighborhood won't care, but the shady owners are teamed up with Cayuga Mgmnt who raised the rent 500% on the beloved Cain's Tavern, and just took over- and now their friends are writing reviews about how butthurt the hipsters are, this is a cool spot and haters should should just get over it.  Total garbage. Yes, neighborhoods change. This is NYC. But they don't have to change for the worse.  Did you really move to Bushwick for a bro bar?  Hey, I love sports too, I just don't want to see my neighborhood turn into Murray Hill. SUCKS that you're here, Little Whiskey, you are the absolute worst.Beware of any ""5 star"" reviews.  No one is walking into this place and saying, ""oh yeah, this place is a 5 star review- I'm RUNNING to yelp about this!""  These are friend-zone reviews trying desperately to help their crappy friends' bar. Oh and the girl who says she ""loved the last bar, but this place is awesome""? YEAH RIGHT.YES I WENT THERE.  STOP TAKING THIS REVIEW DOWN, YELP!Hey but there's more! If you want to watch sports in Bushwick, check out Pinebox- they're a great bar, with the game always on... And there's plenty of other bars with TVs around!  And without! Definitely head to Birdy's or Three Diamond Door.  What about The Sampler?  That place is amazing! And it's NYC, it's always changing- there'll be some great bars on the way.

We sat outside and enjoyed a nice light summer dinner of eggplant rolletini, fried calamari and zucchini, a basket of Italian bread with sundried tomato sauce and two bottles of ice cold Sauvignon Blanc. Consumed slowly over the course of two hours or so, our experience couldn't have been more pleasant.  Our waiter was so nice and brought us a plate of biscotti, for no other reason than to make our experience more enjoyable.

2008,dzwa-zvkW6L2ZUGyNGrmuA,6/24/2021,1 star rating,"One star for the absolutely horrible service we received from the waiter today. I was visiting this restaurant regularly before and figured it'd be a good place to get coffee with my friend if they weren't too busy. We arrived and the restaurant was completely empty since it was 3pm on a Wednesday, so we were the only ones there. We asked the waiter if it's ok for us to just get coffee, and he said yes.Once seated, I wanted to rack up a higher bill so I asked for mocktail options, to which he said he didn't have many juices so he can't really do any good ones. So we ordered two iced coffees instead, thinking that we can probably order an appetizer or platter later. At this point, the waiter made a face at us and said in a rude tone ""Ok, but just so you know, this is not starbucks."" We were confused and reminded him that he had just told us it was OK to order just coffee and he said that he thought we were going to order something else with it. We were so turned off by his passive aggressive behavior, after we had been nothing but courteous, so we left. I later told him that he could've just been professional and said ""btw, there's a $25 minimum, is that OK?"", and that would have been totally reasonable (we didn't know there was a minimum till after the rude comment but would have been happy to accommodate). But to be passive aggressive about it after we had asked if it was OK to begin with, plus when the restaurant is completely empty - this is just unacceptable. I guess covid is over and restaurants can treat their patrons like crap again. They just lost a regular customer."

Went during COVID for lunch on a Saturday and was seated in their nice outdoor dining area, which is open air but still protected from the wind. We have the country pate which was excellent to start. I had the croque monsieur and I must say that it was probably the best one I have had in New York. The gruyere was perfectly charred adding the perfect nutty smokiness but still melty and oozy. The staff were great and really accommodating even moving some tables around to allow us to more easily put our stroller next to us. Would love to come back to try their dinner soon!"
2011,dzwa-zvkW6L2ZUGyNGrmuA,11/20/2021,5 star rating,It's a friendly small restaurant with good food and service.  Being off the avenue and on a narrow makes it nicely quieter. The chicken was good; my friend had both satisfactory.
2012,dzwa-zvkW6L2ZUGyNGrmuA,11/30/2018,3 star rating,This is very old school French but not as well done as I had expected having been open a long time.A little understaffed and seems to be jn a hurry because of theater goers.  But you can feel the hurriedness.My first course mussels described as out of shell came with shells and had to remove it as described when I asked.  Thank you!The coquille Saint Jacques was not very fresh.  The scallops looked like yesterday's and reheated.  The shrimp as well.  The vegetables were fresher looking.  It was okay but it could have been better freshly made.  It didn't seem like it.Dessert I chose was creme brûlée.  The sugar melted well on top for that thin layer of sugar to turn crisp.  But the crema part was like it had gelatin.  Tasted alright but not the consistency I am well familiar with.Hence my rating.
2013,dzwa-zvkW6L2ZUGyNGrmuA,12/24/2016,3 star rating,"Cozy, convenient restaurant that is well familiar with the pre-theater crowd and the crowd rush. Dined there before a show at Lincoln Center and was pleasantly surprised I enjoyed the dishes in the prix fixe menu.La Demi Douzaine d'Escargots de Bourguogne (snails in parsley & garlic butter) - I don't remember if I had ever had snails before this evening but I will surely remember this. Wonderful flavoring of snails sitting in parsley & garlic butter. Doubled as a bread dip for me as well.Snapper - special fish of the day. The description provided by the waiter didn't really match the dish that was presented except for the fact it was indeed a snapper fish and I recognized the accompaniments. I recall a bread-crusted layer I did not expect. Nonetheless, it was decent and hearty. The capers accented the dish nicely.Service and dishes were a little slow for our schedule. Got the Creamy Ricotta Cheese Cake with a Raspberry Coulis to go which I ended up not eating anyway. Maybe another time I can try out the restaurant when not in a rush."
2014,dzwa-zvkW6L2ZUGyNGrmuA,10/14/2021,1 star rating,I am so disappointed with the service and attitude from the staff.

Luckily it wasn't very busy so we scored a table in the back of the restaurant. This place is a tight squeeze for sure, and unfortunately the seat I had was right above a leaky spot on the roof to which I began to notice was dripping into my ramen bowl! I moved seats and stopped eating. What I did eat though did not sit well with my stomach for the rest of the day and the following. I don't know if it was the leaky roofs content or the food itself but I'll be honest and say I've been reluctant to return. Overall, people rave about this place, but I've experienced way better customer service and ambiance. Take into account that if it's lunch rush, there will definitely be a wait and a line out the door since once again, there's not much space to wait inside."

I still miss that avo Tina app they had ages ago but let's be real it's all about the ramen. It's nice that they made it explicit on the menu that you can choose the cook of your noodles, from soft to al dente to firm. I prefer my noodles on the firmer side always. I got the extra spicy miso ramen with garlic paste which is an umami BOMB."
2019,OjUw8sy1xpn_XwO4QaJoMA,8/19/2019,4 star rating,"Although it was 85 degrees outside in bright summer time, I was still craving ramen so I decided to check this place out. With so many reviews on Yelp, I had higher standards, in which they failed to meet the bar. However, it was still a solid ramen place with fair prices given how full you can get from the Mega Paitan. My friend and I shared a pulled char siu pork mayo don and the Mega Paitan, which was overall very filling.The char siu don is really good, with the smoky flavor coming from the flames that they torched over the bowl. The Mega Paitan had generous amounts of char siu, pulled char siu, and pork belly. The overall bowl is a little bit on the saltier side, and the noodles are a bit softer than I expected. They say that the noodles are made al dente, but this texture is not really that al dente. Overall, this is a decent ramen place to check out, though I have had better in a lot of other places."

We were overwhelmed by the massiveness of the concrete jungle, vibrant NY hustle and bustle, and multi-faceted culture. But the food was one among many things we appreciated about New York. Ramen was on the top of our list because I heard the ramen here was lit.We yelped for the closest top ramen around and found Totto Ramen. It was a few blocks from our hotel so we thought we'd give it a try. Upon arrival, we were confused by the location of the storefront. We didn't realize it was nestled below the sidewalk. The restaurant was extremely tiny, but they had someone outside to facilitate the line. He took our order ahead of time since there was a long queue of folks outside. We waited for about 45 minutes. While we waited, we observed the bowls of ramen being served to the tables. It smelled and looked so good that I couldn't wait to try it. They also had hip hop music playing, so that was enjoyable. Nevertheless, it looked crowded due to the small space, but I think that's part of the experience.When we finally got seated, we shared our table with another couple. The service was very fast and efficient. Our estimated time from sit down to leaving was about 30 min. I got the Mega Ramen for about $16. It came with char siu pork and chicken broth. The ramen was amazing - it was tasty and delicious and definitely lots of umami love ; portions are just sufficient. The prices, however, were expensive but definitely worth every penny. Keep in mind, the are CASH ONLY.I would definitely come back when I get the chance to."
2021,OjUw8sy1xpn_XwO4QaJoMA,6/10/2019,4 star rating,"I came to the Totto Ramen Next Door location without realizing until now, so I guess I'll have to come back again to visit the flagship location. Slick.I got the Mega Paitan which is their wavy noodles with char siu pork, pulled char siu pork, pork belly chunks, garlic, onion, bean sprouts, scallions, cabbage, and ""half-boiled"" eggs. I really liked the char siu pork and the pork belly chunks in particular in this ramen as these items stood out to me. It is indeed very filling as it's their ""mega"" size compared to their classic Chicken Paitan. It also cost about $5 more for the mega portion which is very well marketed as their ""best seller"".Service is pretty standard, nothing too special. The ""Next Door"" location does take credit cards and Apple Pay which was probably what attracted me to it. The original location apparently is cash only so I'll be prepared for the next time."

I asked the worker if she recommended pork or chicken and she said ""definitely chicken"". I got my food in like 5 minutes which is super quick! The noodles and the spice were on point! The nori was really salty which I liked. The chicken was a bit dry right off the bat but if you let it soak in the broth it gets more juicy closer to the end. It was my first time trying ramen with chicken which was interesting but next time I think I'm going to stick with what I know and get pork instead. This was still a good bowl of ramen."

Maybe it was just an ""off day"" and this isn't the norm for the restaurant, but eating at Vegetarian Dim Sum House was a very unpleasant dining experience in terms of the quality of food.Indoors has a strange musty smell (like a combination of damp towels and dust) so we switched to sitting outside in the cold. Unfortunately, that scent carried over into the taste of all of the dishes we had ordered and consequently made every bite inedible. As a former vegan, I have had faux seafood and meat before and the imitation shrimp and pork tasted nothing like what was expected. Unfortunately, the food was so bad that we don't see ourselves returning or recommending the restaurant. Besides the food, the service is rather fast and accommodating."

2030,sswuN6W-p8wpIeQIoGuHmQ,1/12/2020,3 star rating,"Picked this spot on a post lunchtime window Saturday afternoon. The place serves all vegetarian items even though the menu says ""Chicken"". The ambiance is alright and looks like it hasn't been done up in a long long time. We were seated immediately and served some hot tea which was delightful . Decided to order Pan fried dumplings and Szechuan Chicken. The pan fried dumplings were huge and stayed true to the fried part with quite some oil. This is the opposite of healthy. With the dipping sauce it tasted pretty good. Would recommend this if you like slightly chewy pan fried dumplings.The chicken was actually a wheat based mock meat (possibly Seitan) stuffed with mushroom. I expected the dish to come with a side of rice but that wasn't the case. The dish itself lacked that punch that I was expecting out of Szechuan and was mostly a lot of oil and soy. With close to $18 for the price, I feel the dish was not at all worth it. My suggestion would be to stick to what they do best , dumplings. Good options for those vegetarians out there."
2031,sswuN6W-p8wpIeQIoGuHmQ,1/5/2020,4 star rating,"THIS PLACE IS SO YUMMY! AND well priced. The place is small and we went in Christmas Day, so there was a 20min wait, not bad overall. We had four dishes between 2 of us and that was plenty (you could get away with 3 dishes even). We had the mock roast pork buns, snow pea dumpling (my favorite, kinda gooey), rice flour roll with Chinese kale, and fried Napa roll. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. I only dinged one star because they forget about one of our items until we reminded them...and I heard 2 other tables around us have the same thing happen. So if you notice one dish seems to be taking longer... speak up! Because otherwise this places is 5 stars all around."

Vegetarian mock roast pork buns (3) - I'd be lying if I said they compared to actual pork buns but it makes a hearty, satisfying substitute. Spinach dumplings (3) - Very good. Must order. It was light, satisfying, and large portions without making you feel heavy afterwards. Service - Nice.Interior - Very quiet. I don't think I heard music the entire time."

This is the third time I eat here and it continues to meet my expectations. They require proof of vaccination cards to be seated. I order the same things every time I go (Sapporo, Oysters, and the Pineapple Passion Fruit Cocktail). However, this time I added the Karaage Fried Chicken. Wow!

The chicken karage comes with matcha salt which is unbelievable. I did the vegan ramen along with some happy hour oysters and I could not get enough. The ramen broth was so rich. Cannot wait to come back and try more.

Now that they have a nice outdoor set up we were easily able to get a table for dinner and drinks! Overall only had to wait about 15 minutes but they allowed us to order drinks during our wait. I had the pork rice bowl which was delicious and two drinks both of which were well made and strong. Definitely a good spot to check out if you're in the area!"

That may seem like overly high praise for a restaurant with no sign located in Hamilton Heights, but after spending months in NYC, it's the place I wish I could find outside of the city. The ramen and oysters always deliver. What's more, the cocktails are truly fantastic. I personally love the smokey Scotch Lovers' Penicillin, but all of the cocktails I've had at ROKC are exceptionally well balanced and delicious. Problem is, I always have one more than I need because I want to try them all!"
2045,sswuN6W-p8wpIeQIoGuHmQ,2/21/2022,3 star rating,"it is with a heavy heart I write this review. I fell in love with ROKC just after it reopened post pandemic shutdown. my bf introduced me. I'd never had ramen or karaage before. their kyoto made my palette soar and the karaage was sooo yummy.  but as of late the recipe has been inconsistent, sometimes the kyoto is very spicy then others not so much. they,ve reduced the number of braised pork in the ramen, down by one and sometimes the fat is poorly trimmed and I get a piece that's mostly fat. the karaage has also changed and not for the better. it used to be juicy and flavorful, now it's over cooked and just a more salty profile. there are not many good ramen spots in nyc, let alone in northern manhattan. I really wish with all my heart they would get back to the way they used to be."

The pizza was thin crust which I really like. One was cheese and pepperoni the other was margarita. The flavor was good and it was still hot  when I got it back to the hotel.

I went on a date here (last minute picking due to Covid) Last call for the kitchen was at 10pm &last call for alcohol was like around 1015ish... We order while we waited for our table ( b/c they were closing the kitchen). We finally sit and order our drinks; the female at the counter while we waited told us that we had a good time to order atleast (2) drinks. When we sit, the waiter (a younger boy w/ glasses) brings our food and drinks. After 1 min, he returns and says you guys want anything else (drinks) b/c we are closing. I asked for another Margarita. My date said no he was okay. 3 minutes later, my date decides hey let me order another drink. The waiter says ""No Too Late I Don't Want Other Customers Complaining"" ( Okay at this point I don't even have my drink- YET!!! Cool.. 1/2 later I get my drink, so I tell the waiter.. You could of brought both drinks out if that was the case. Fast forward, we are eating and literally 2 minutes later ( a female waiter) comes up to the table; while we are conversing and she says ""Hey you guys have to wrap it up!"" Wait what?!?! I know NYC after Covid has a rule by 11pm.. all businesses have to be wrapping up w/ outdoor seating.. however why sit us at almost 10pm then rush us out just to get in a few bucks before you close!!!?? She basically told my date as he talked.. ""Shut up and eat and hurry up!"" NOT COOL.. won't be coming back just b/c of that. The food was okay.. Nothing out of this world!!"

The incompetent waitress couldn't follow a simple instruction of splitting the bill. When we pointed it out she got angry with us and told us she wouldn't bring the manager to us. That we would have get up and go to the back to speak to the manager. I found that rude and unprofessional. Also throughout the dinner sher never refilled our drinks or checked up on us.The food was good so I give 2 stars.The chips here are not unlimited. There are plenty of Mexican restaurants that give you unlimited chips and salsa.

Not only was the staff kind and attentive but the Cortado they made me was delicious. My fiancé ordered a maple latte and although she would have liked it sweeter I enjoyed the subtle flavors that allowed you to taste the coffee. I can't forget to mention the enormous chocolate chip cookies that were fresh out of the oven. I'm in love.

Both were REALLY good. The oat milk latte was super creamy and smooth but not overwhelmingly milky. The chocolate chip cookie was really rich and surprisingly good at room temperature. It's pretty thick. but chewy and chocolatey, so no complaints there. I'm not sure if they warm the cookies up for you if ask. Overall, solid cookie and solid coffee! The cookie is up there with Levain's."

A perfect place for an early morning pick-me-up. They also had a good selection of other pastries too that seemed like it could be worth trying. The cookies were just undercooked enough in the middle to leave it nice and oozy as you bit into it warm and straight out of the oven. What a treat!"
2073,adpldzX9R1GEBwPht9PL8w,12/4/2022,5 star rating,"The best chocolate chip cookie can be had here! The outside has a nice crunch while the inside is soft but not too gooey or mushy.

The chocolate croissant was so stale I couldn't even get a bite off without gnawing at it. It felt like it was made a couple days ago. It was not fresh and served cold. It definitely wasn't worth $4.The latte was absolutely fantastic and worth the $5.75. It definitely hit the spot and the espresso:milk ratio was on point. Overall, I wish I had just gotten the coffee and left breakfast for another place, like the breakfast carts around the corner. I know I'm in NYC but $10 for a coffee and croissant was too much :'(."

My husband and I went to both locations in the same day -- first to get some coffee and the next to get their famous chocolate chip cookie! For coffee, I got a oat milk maple macchiato and it was absolutely amazing. It was smooth, creamy and since I like my coffee sweet, the barista put an extra pump of the maple syrup. My husband got a cortado that he said was okay (not bad but not the best he's had).The first location was bigger and had lots of space and light inside. We were able to get a seat at the long bar table and it was not the busy yet (around 10:30am on a Saturday). However, within 20 minutes, the shop was pretty bustling.The second location was smaller, but we popped in 30 min before closing to try their famous chocolate chip cookie. They had a few left (a sign that they must be good). However, note that they do not reheat the cookies for you...the barista told me that they make them in such small batches/frequently that it would probably still be warm. He was right, the cookie was the perfect temp and absolutely divine. Warm, gooey, chocolatey with the right amount of chewiness to crunchiness from the outer edge. Definitely worth trying!!"

In its entire existence, East has definitely lived through a lot - it used to also be a buffet scene and now it's bbq takeout/family style/dim sum, then it's change of owners, multiple renovations, covid pandemic, etc. I was honestly really hoping that they would stay consistent with their food but I guess that's too high of an expectation. The lobsters were small and the flavor was simply OK. The walnut shrimp was not bad and the crispy garlic chicken was my favorite out of everything. The salt and pepper porkchops was actually the primary reason why I came here (I would order this all the time up until covid) and to my disdain, this time they used an old batch of oil to cook up our dish (see photo). On top of the unwelcomed discoloration, the porkchops were also dressed with visibly copious amounts of MSG and was barely palatable. I was sad to have to introduce my Filipino friends to Cantonese family style dinner this way. So here's what I advise: definitely go there for the bbq meats (I personally prefer their soy sauce chicken and sometimes duck - check the window to see the quality first) and maybe dim sum. Do yourself and your family a favor and skip family style dinner here."

2085,wXiIxbnFRaFBS9RI4wJrdw,9/7/2020,4 star rating,"The main building for this place is shut down BUT they opened up a smaller building right next door to the original place. I've always come here for dim sum, the buffet, dinner, or special occasions with my family ever since I was younger. It was constantly bustling, groups of hungry people waiting for their food. It has been one of my family's original go-to restaurants for family gatherings. The staff speak Chinese and they're really friendly. Some may seem a little cold or rude at first, but once you talk with them, they're actually super nice. Even though they shut down, their new location is still very busy, so they must be making good business. They're only offering takeout right now - NO sit down dining. Although the new location has stickers on the floor to indicate 6 feet apart, nobody seems to follow them. The lines were confusing and there was no distinct direction to follow upon entering. Once you come in, the place to order the freshly prepared meat (roasted duck, crispy pork, etc.) is to your left. The lady there takes your order and you pay at the register, which is to the right of the meat area. The workers cut the meat right in front of you behind a glass barrier. As you walk further into the restaurant, there are carts with containers filled with random dim sum options. You can line up there to grab some dim sum. The staff all wear gloves and masks, but around lunch and dinner times the place can get pretty packed - violating the social distancing rule. This building is currently still being renovated, so only a small area is available for them to serve people. This limits the space, causing customers to be a little close to each other when they're waiting for their order to be prepared. They try to work fast, but it's hard when a lot of customers start coming in. Ultimately, I'd recommend being careful when coming here and try to avoid the crowd. Their food is still super fresh and delicious! I hope they open up for regular business soon once the COVID situation has settled down a bit."

I've always come here for dim sum, the buffet, dinner, or special occasions with my family ever since I was younger. It was constantly bustling, groups of hungry people waiting for their food. It has been one of my family's original go-to restaurants for family gatherings. The staff speak Chinese and they're really friendly. Some may seem a little cold or rude at first, but once you talk with them, they're actually super nice. Even though they shut down, their new location is still very busy, so they must be making good business. They're only offering takeout right now - NO sit down dining. Although the new location has stickers on the floor to indicate 6 feet apart, nobody seems to follow them. The lines were confusing and there was no distinct direction to follow upon entering. Once you come in, the place to order the freshly prepared meat (roasted duck, crispy pork, etc.) is to your left. The lady there takes your order and you pay at the register, which is to the right of the meat area. The workers cut the meat right in front of you behind a glass barrier. As you walk further into the restaurant, there are carts with containers filled with random dim sum options. You can line up there to grab some dim sum. The staff all wear gloves and masks, but around lunch and dinner times the place can get pretty packed - violating the social distancing rule. This building is currently still being renovated, so only a small area is available for them to serve people. This limits the space, causing customers to be a little close to each other when they're waiting for their order to be prepared. They try to work fast, but it's hard when a lot of customers start coming in. Ultimately, I'd recommend being careful when coming here and try to avoid the crowd.

My personal favorites are pistachio and coffee, but can't go wrong with anything here. They also have a great selection of toppings here and they are not shy from really layering it well, and not just letting them sit on the top or bottom.Ice Cream Cake: I've preordered an ice cream cake from here, one week preorders for those. It actually was amazing, made from their selection of ice cream choices and depending on size you can mix and match 2-3 flavors. Happy to say all my guests really enjoyed it!"

Make sure to check their hours before you go: their hours are really arbitrary and they're closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. It's cash only but there's an ATM in the store. They're offering to-go and dine in, but they have a limited number of tables/booths available. Eddie's offerings are pretty traditional and classic, and they don't have any wild flavor combinations or toppings. I shared a Banana Split ($9.50) with my friend and we got Mint Chip and Butter Pecan. I'd come here for the aesthetics and history of Eddie's, however the ice cream was okay and pretty mediocre. It was annoying that all the syrup was on the plate and not on top of the ice cream, and the whipped cream tasted overbeaten and heavy. TLDR: Eddie's Sweet Shop has a nice aesthetic and the store's history is what sustains its reputation. But I thought the ice cream was just okay."

He said ""almost"". 5 mins later, he came back with our receipt, basically they charged us first, but forget to prepare or missed to prepare our order. We waited 25 minutes to finally get it as shown in pic, I threw it to the garbage right away! The young guy was not apologizing, just said "" We Messed up the order""  with a horrific attitude.

2171,o-obS-OEbXSrdIdLqPYzXw,6/26/2022,5 star rating,"I have no idea what the negative reviews are about.  (Sometimes I think people attach their review to the wrong business or are trolling.)  This is extremely high quality ice cream and the whipped cream is freshly made, doesn't come from a can and sits in a large bowl inside a 1940's refrigerator.  It's true that sometimes the kids who work there are sometimes a bit disorganized, but I've never experienced rudeness.   It's been run by the same family since the 1960's or 70's and the current owner (the son of the people who used to own and run it and the grandson of the guy who made the ice cream) is an extremely nice guy and always has been.   It is a thick ice cream, but I don't think that necessarily implies that artificial thickeners are being used.  It's just a dense ice-cream whereas most modern ice-creams are packed with air.  A pint of Eddie's ice-cream weighs far more than a pint of say, Haagen-Dazs and that's a good thing.   I find it quite flavorful, although not as flavorful as the best gelatos.  The malteds and ice-cream sodas will take you back to the 1950's.    I will say that the last time I had an egg-cream there, it was not made properly:  way too much syrup and not the right seltzer to milk ratio, but that could have been a fluke.  This is still a place that when you eat there, they give you the metal container from the malted so you can refill your glass with the remainder (but they don't give you the rest on takeout orders).   And it's a great place that has the original fixtures from the 1920's or 30's when it first opened.  It's the original - not a re-creation.  A number of TV commercials and films have been shot there, including a scene from Brighton Beach Memoirs.   The only negatives are that, like many other things, it has gotten pricey and they do currently have limited hours (I think they're closed on Mondays and Tuesday sand some other days they don't open until late afternoon), a bit surprising during the summer.   Also, the dishes are still washed in sinks, not in a dishwater, so technically, they are not sanitized, but I suppose one can always ask that theirs be served in a paper cup."

Accordingly, I arrived early - actually on-time for my 6:45 reservation. I've never been here before, but it's been on my list of want to visit restaurants for a long time. To the restaurant's credit, they seated me straight away while I waited. To their discredit, no one thought to offer me water or a drink for 20 minutes even though they both seated and took the order of the table next to mine. In fact, the gentleman who gave the table next door water, didn't even spare me a glance. Did I mention the outside temperature this evening exceeded 90F?Now, to counteract the abysmal service, the food was very good. I had the grilled calamari salad followed by the mussels. The calamari was very tasty but a bit chewy. And if you like your mussels very garlicky as I do you might be a bit disappointed. Again, very tasty, but a little under garlicky. The other members of my party enjoyed their meal. So overall good food, poor service."

I had the beef bourgenoun (I can eat it...just can't spell it).  Great.  Nice mix of spices and wonderfully prepared veggies including the pearl onions which most restaurants omit.  It could have had a dash of cognac for more ""depth"" and the sauce could have been boiled a couple of minutes to be less ""floury"".Truly a find.  Best French restaurant since Sans Coulette closed."

2199,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,6/20/2021,4 star rating,"This destination is as much about the ambiance as the food. To the extent possible, opt for the indoor space, which feels like the rustic drawing room of the Russian relatives you never knew you had, in another era.For vegetarians the best options are unsurprisingly carb-heavy. Favorites were the potato vareniki, topped with a fantastic caramelized onion oil, and the Olivier salad, served with pumpernickel bread. We also got the kasha (buckwheat) on the side - a nostalgic favorite among our Ashkenazi family as well.The zucchini pancakes were tasty, although I'd have preferred them a bit crispier - perhaps biased by my taste for Korean pa-jeon. The khachapuri was tasty too, although I prefer the slightly crunchier bread served at Tone Cafe in Brighton Beach."

We didn't make a reservation, but luckily, there was a table available for 1.5 hours. The interior was darker than in the photos and the decor looked like an antique shop with vintage dolls and toys. Admittedly, I felt pretty creeped out by the dolls. My friends and I shared two entrees and a soup. I don't remember what their names were, but they were delicious though.   I also tried the Natasha Rostova, one of their signature cocktails. It tasted pretty sweet and the vodka was not as strong. But the price, oh gosh, $17 for a cocktail! It is probably one of the most expensive cocktails I've tried so far. But I truly believe you get what you pay for. The service overall was nice. Our waiter was super patient with us since we had trouble deciding what to order. It also took a long while for the food to be served. Given the benefit of the doubt, it was a Saturday evening, so the kitchen was probably super busy.I would visit again and try the other entrees and the appetizers."

We were seated quickly and the waiter took our order shortly thereafter. Everyone was very courteous and expedient, it was a good pace. I ordered the ($33)Chicken Tapaka. It was a crispy little chicken. I wanted to make sure I had enough protein, and while it's a tiny chicken, it was filling. The texture of the skin was perfect. The taste was complex, light, and refreshing. It came with a nice red sauce that had good flavor. It was served with pickled cabbage, which was light and tasty. I actually ate it all, I usually leave it in the plate at other restaurants. This has to be the most refreshing pickled cabbage I've had. My wife ordered the beef stroganoff. It was complex. The mushrooms were very tasty. There wasn't anywhere near as much meat as on the chicken tapaka, if that's what you are looking for. But it was very tasty. I thought my wife was crazy for ordering stroganoff, it most often tastes like it came out of a can. But this was delicious and clearly the chef put love into its preparation. We ordered the honey cake($14) for dessert. It was perfect to split between 2 people. It was delicious, one of the best honey cakes I've had. It has some Graham cracker taste, but not overwhelmingly. I can't see coming here without getting the honey cake. Another table ordered the Napoleon, it was very impressive and I may try it one day. But I can never pass up honey cake. Heads up, honey cake isn't very sweet compared to many other desserts. But it's my favorite. We want to return. My wife said she wants to order the beef stroganoff again. I would like to try something different. Even though the rest of the entrées did not sound appealing, I'm sure I'm I'll find something good."

We told her to double check, she finally found our reservation, then she asked for vaccination ( but before making reservation she didn't mention that we need two shots, okay I get it, we made 50% mistake, but still things like this matter, especially on Manhattan, she should of mention that). So, we ended up leaving this place disappointed on New Year's Day.P.S. Not a big fan of negative reviews, but I must say that sometimes restaurants and cafes need more flexibility to its customers."

I sat at the bar and a host greeted me, I asked her If they had happy hour, she said they did. I ordered a vodka ( well) and soda. She said okay. Then after 5 minutes what it looked like the bartender came behind the bar and gave a VS, then the host and the bartender sat at the bar with me to eat rice and eggs!! .. I decided to pay and leave, asked for my check ... 15 bucks plus 20%  of tip already included.... ( what a nice happy hour) I asked her about the HH... she was confused and could not give an answer, she just told me that she could not find the Vodka and soda HH button on the POS.... So   I just paid a HH vodka and soda for 16 bucks, with tip included ( which ins not even legal, only parties of 6 or more)What a joke of place..do not make the same mistake.. don't go there"

Bathroom was also nice and had a lot of sinks/stalls. I had the tacos and my boyfriend has the burritos. Food and drinks were good and served in good portions.

We opted for an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a pitcher, After not being satisfied with the prefixed brunch entrees. This way we could order off the regular menu.

2209,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,10/10/2022,2 star rating,"I came here after rave reviews from a friend and was incredibly disappointed. The ambience is very cute but the music was way too loud for a Tuesday night with three tables in the whole restaurant. I had to yell in order for my friend to hear me across the table. We sat for a bit before anyone came to take our order. We were approached by someone looking to sell hookah for $40 before our server even came over. We ordered drinks and I got the Cadillac margarita which was actually very tasty. We ordered chips and salsa which was not on the menu but we kind of assumed they would have them. The chips came in a very small basket with a very small side of salsa and were pretty average. For my meal, I got a chicken quesadilla which was tasty but not worth the price - It came with no side at all. We asked for a refill of chips and salsa and shortly after we asked for the bill.The waitress came over with one of the portable POS systems and our bill was over $90!! I was pretty shocked because we got two drinks, chips and salsa and one entrée. I asked her if she could print out the bill so that I could see what exactly was on there. We were charged $22 for chips and salsa!! Gratuity was automatically included. When I asked her why we were charged $22 our waitress said that chips and salsa is $11 and when we got a refill they charged us another $11. Ridiculous. When I said that no one told us there would be a charge for a refill on chips, she caught an attitude, walked away rolling her eyes, and got the manager. This was where it got kind of comical...The manager, although very nice, provided the worst reasoning I think I've heard in a while. He said that their chips are homemade and they are special because they are crispy. Those chips were literally poured out of a wholesale bag and isn't the point of chips to be crispy? How is that special? He then further went on to explain that all of the Mexican restaurants in the area met and agreed that they would charge the same price for chips and salsa. What is there like a secret chip and salsa committee? This was the most ridiculous thing I had heard in a while, especially considering the fact that it was a blatant lie. All anyone would have to do is look up the menu of other Mexican restaurants in the area and you would see that their chips and salsa are much more reasonably priced. The majority of Mexican restaurants either A) do not charge for chips and salsa or B) provide free refills. The salsa that we received was probably 3 tablespoons worth... Of course we are going to want a refill! He then told me that the waitress was having a rough night (hence her attitude). Sorry that's not excusable... You are in an industry where the money you make is based on good service - maybe that's why they automatically add gratuity. The manager took both orders of chips and salsa and the automatic gratuity off of our bill and it was pretty shocking how much less the bill ended up being. This place looks very cute on the inside but their service, prices and lack of any specials leaves much to be desired. What kind of restaurant advertises taco Tuesday but doesn't offer any specials? No wonder they were pretty much empty. The entire experience just rubbed me the wrong way and I definitely will not be returning."

I've eaten here about a half dozen times so far and think for the price and location, it can't be beat. Sure $10-$12 a day for lunch is pricey but for a sub w/ free pickle and chips and then a can of soda for $1.25 which seems the going rate down here, it's fair. I've even saved half the sub on some days. I like the Godfather and Mussolini's' revenge. I had the bacon cheeseburger platter last Friday and was amazed. I could barely eat the burger after the eating the fries. The fries were seasoned/salted and crispy. I opened the burger and it was 2 patties, 3 slices of bacon in half, so 6 slices. I split the bacon between the burger patties and forced myself to eat the whole thing. If you are looking for a quick lunch and great food, I'd recommend here."

My wrap was just chicken and dressing with a slice of cheese because there was barely any salad in it. Are you kidding me that's what I paid $8 bucks for. A nasty wrap because that wasn't even chicken Cesar. Where was the rest of the Ingredients. The worst part was that I couldn't eat it. I wouldn't have mind paying $8 bucks for whatever hat wrap was, had it actually been tasteful. Two bites was all I could eat. I threw it out and had to go buy lunch again!

The beginning or middle of the order?)Finished choosing the rollsWas preparing my Amex card and he says ""don't mean to rush you ... but can you hurry up""...seriously I took 5 seconds to get my card ready.Poor customer service, no manners.Will not be ordering here again.Every business needs to do more than hire workers.  There has to be training, policies have to be implemented, ...order sizes + delivery charges should be discussed before orders are placed & never assume anything.  Would the boss be happy if he knew you turned down a customer who wants to order party platters for $500 - when you thought they just wanted a lunch special? No.Treat others the way you would like to be treated.Staff Training Required."

2240,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,10/24/2014,2 star rating,"Big on Quantity | Industrial Sushi | Average at bestWe got the deluxe platter delivered to the office. It was $54.95. It was enough for 8 - 10 people.You get a huge platter of sushi, but it is all basically the same thing - tuna or salmon, avocado here and there with small variations on what is sprinkled on the outside.Tuna roll, tuna with avocado, cucumber and tuna, cucumber and tuna tuna wrapped  in avocado sometimes covered with salmon. I  found it boring.   Some of the seared tuna was overcooked and dry, very unimaginative.There are a million sushi places in this neighborhood. This one is not the best, not the worst, but it is average at best. I will not be repeating."

I mean, if I could eat veggie sushi as an appetizer to every meal I would be okay with that. Sometimes I'd have avacado, sometimes cucumber, and sometimes I'd have the red onion roll. Okay maybe they do this lots of places, but I haven't seen it. They fry onions....like onion rings, and then they put it in sushi. THEY PUT ONION RINGS IN SUSHI. Have you ever heard of something so delicious? This is the only take out place my husband and I order from regularly. We love to cook, and to be honest most kosher places don't deliver. But sushi fussion? Yup, they deliver. And they deliver on time, and it's ALWAYS fresh. And it tastes good, and it's cheap. It's so unbelievably affordable! I know what I'm in the mood for tonight!"

Just pay up front and wait for the food to be delivered.You really do get bang for your buck in this place. The vegetable biryani is one of my favorite things to order from here.The salmon platter with rice is enough for two people - so keep this in mind when eating here. The chicken tandoori is always a good choice - also keep this in mind.Don't spend money on any fruit shakes or drinks.Just come in here for the great Indian Food!

Everyone on here recommended the fish curry, which is good but I recommend the kacci biryani - the lamb is tender and has crispy pieces of fried onion to provide contrast. Muglai paratha is a new dish to me - fried paratha filled with egg and mince meat mixture. Almost like a panini in shape. It was very good as well but we just had too much food so couldn't finish it. Oh just as FYI, the wait time on the muglai paratha could be long."

2300,wMYocgxx-pPbFFYPFYND5g,11/16/2021,5 star rating,"Where to start- I've been going to madman for about 3 years now. I found it during my freshmen year of college and it quickly became my go-to coffee shop for many reasons. First, being that I firmly believe it's the best cup of coffee in NYC, whenever I visit with family or friends, this place is the NYC staple I bring them to. The quality of the coffee is something you can't find elsewhere, as it always taste fresh and you can taste that it's made with care. Secondly, the student discount REALLY helps when you're buying 2-3 coffees a day because it just tastes that good. The pricing is fair and you can buy caffe vita bags to take home as well. Thirdly, the service is impeccable. Mostly because of the Mad Man himself, Marco, a lovely and talented Italian photographer who runs and owns the place, and can be found in store behind the bar on a number of days working alongside the baristas. He always greets with a smile and makes you feel welcome- the type of feeling that you can't get anywhere else in NYC. The baristas as well are always timely, friendly, and hospitable and often remember your drink if you come in more than once or twice. Everyone is welcome here (furry friends too, they've got dog treats for your pup as well!) and whenever I go home out of state, I'm always thinking about when I'll return to get my next cup of madman espresso. P.s. try the Carmelisa, it's incredible!"

(this soup always came with a slice of lemon, mint leaves, bean sprout, and sauces on the side. There wasn't anything packaged on the side.

I had the beet and dill vodka drink for $7. It  was unlike anything I've ever had before! It's mostly infused vodka served straight up. Also had the cilantro Bloody Mary. I love cilantro and am so happy to have heard of this concoction! It was great once you got to the bottom and could really taste the cilantro. Decor is grandma-esque.
2347,6Z9Bo8cUMYdwe01llOy0gQ,8/31/2018,3 star rating,"As hipster as you can get! The Good: Went there around midnight and loved the decor and the ambience. Lovely cozy interiors and awesome views from the large deck with Manhattan on one direction and the Brooklyn Queens Expressway overpass on the other. The Bad: Not sure what the hype is all about: partner had one of their fresh lime, frozen margaritas and I got a simple cocktail, something with orange-blossom and herbs... but found both to be too weak. If only the drinks were as good as the looks!"
2348,6Z9Bo8cUMYdwe01llOy0gQ,10/2/2017,2 star rating,"Warning - check your credit card statement if you buy drinks here! My total was $60 after tip and when I checked my posted statement a few days later, it looked like someone decided to add $4 extra to the total. I disputed it with my credit card company and got the credit, but I find it very dishonorable that the bartenders would do such a thing (and got away with it since Chase ate the cost). I'm still giving two stars since I think it's a nice space, but overall turned off by the behavior of the staff. Maybe stick to the cash bar if you insist on enjoying the rooftop area -- it'll be harder to take your money that way."
2349,6Z9Bo8cUMYdwe01llOy0gQ,7/20/2017,3 star rating,"Ugh, I want to like this place more I just don't. The rooftop is a great thing, though.Decent amount of space on the inside, but rather a lot of open space in the middle of the room that isn't easily occupied. It's not like it's a dancing spot, so there's not much reason to have that space, and even if your party is cool just standing around, you have nowhere to anchor or put your drinks. There are little couches and stuff around the edges so if you can snag those, great! The decor is sort of run-down burlesque with dim fringed lighting (very dim) and a ceiling painted to mimic that of grand central. These things would normally be like crack for me but in the four years or so I've been there the cocktails they haven't changed once and they've always disappointed. They're also lacking a good amount of standard liquor brands, don't expect to find your favorite here. It's also obscenely loud so don't expect to carry on a conversation. The decor sets itself up to be a great date spot but it just doesn't work when you're inches away from each others faces and still screaming."

It is a lovely space with reasonably priced drinks, and the young people made space for two aging lowlifes to sit in the corner."

2357,U_OFOSHg6vt-oG2IzCkhww,3/17/2016,4 star rating,"Quiet little bar in Carroll Gardens. We came here while waiting for a table at Prime Meats down the street.The bartender was the owner himself and was very nice and welcoming. He gave us drink recommendations and mentioned he had over a hundred whiskeys in stock to try. I opted for a drink with baijiu (an alcohol from China that's said to turn you blind) and barley tea. It was aight.Some of the biggest selling points for me were that it wasn't overly loud even for a Saturday evening. We were able to sit at the bar and have a conversation without having to scream at the top of our lungs. We got drinks immediately, and there was no huss and fuss.This is a great place to come and unwind."

He can be particular (hates crowds, super loud music, and poorly-made Manhattans), so I was a bit stressed out. Travel Bar came up and it looked great, so I reached out to the owner to give him a heads up that we would have a group of about 10-12 people coming in. There are many things that are great about this bar, but really, my interaction with Mike is what completely sold me. Not only did he answer me right away, but he was super helpful. He let me know that I could bring a cake and they would cut/serve it. He also gave me an option of letting people open/pay separate checks, which I really appreciated. I have hosted too many birthday parties where I've gotten stuck with most of the bill at the end.Upon arrival, we noticed that a few tables had been set aside for us, which was really nice, and Mike was just as friendly/helpful in person as he was through email. He's very knowledgeable about spirits and even introduced me to my new favorite, Dillon's Rose Gin. Overall, great experience, and I have been raving about it ever since!

Our second visit was even better.  I am a big fan of the Black Manhattan, and they introduced me to Staggs Jr. Bourbon, which was outrageously good. I can't wait to go back."

Mike made me many a mezcal cocktail and they were all delicious. They have an extensive list of spirits, which even brought a Yelper on a whiskey quest in from Florida (where's your review, Layla!?). We've already been back since our first visit.Go to Travel Bar. Be nice to the guys. Great ambiance, nice date spot, good for small groups, freaking awesome spinach artichoke dip.

There were two things that really stuck out on this, a chorizo pate type thing and the smoked ricotta.  SO SO GOOD! The best part of all...there werent any drunk 21 years old hanging around.  This was a place for people who want an amazing cocktail but not have to deal with kids. Where you could actually sit and enjoy spending time with your friends out and hear them talking.  There was no super loud music playing fist pumping music (I like that scene if I'm at a club) but this is your Cheers like bar but with really high class drinks.Will be going back every chance I get!"

2366,3_pn5nxp9NuGv7tJ61Mslw,12/28/2019,5 star rating,"This sushi restaurant had recently became one of my favorites for their QUALITY and QUANTITY, and somehow manage to be cost-effective. $1 for 3 pieces of nigiri. Usually, in Manhattan it's $3+ for 1 piece of nigiri. And the sushi here is actually good too! They also give you big pieces of fish. Prepaid $10 and enjoy everything on the menu at a discounted price; $1-$3 max. Includes 1 soup & 1 salad. ""Today's Special"" items are not included in the discount but they are usually the freshest seafood in their kitchen so I highly recommend trying something on their ""Today's Special"" menu. I had their Live Lobster sashimi twice and still can't get over how fresh and delicious it was. The best part is that it's only $25! If you were to get this in Manhattan, expect to pay double. It was a whole lobster. My only question is ""where's the lobster claws?"" I cannot not write about their Kumamoto oysters as they were mouth-wateringly delicious at $15 for 6 pieces. Also, their California uni at $6 per piece is something I would never skip!All of the sushi were fresh and delicious except for the seared tuna and seared salmon. Those 2 were my least favorite pieces. Perhaps, they are not good at searing? Always always ALWAYS get salmon! I also recommend their smoked salmon, salmon roe, wasabi tobiko, salmon avocado roll, and $1 squid as appetizers. Their squid ramen is NOT overpowered with MSG because I didn't die from thirst after finishing it. Already thinking about coming back!"

Staff is a little confusing but they are very nice and accommodating! But I don't know what to say about their menu. They have a special where you can pay a baseline payment of $10. And with this everything you order after is a reduced price. So you have $10 on your bill if you order two appetizers it would be $2 instead of the original price. Sushi rolls and special rolls are obviously more expensive than appetizers. Ranging from $2-8. Warning. If one person on your table orders the special pricing. Everyone else needs too as well!! I'm not sure if this place is worth going to over a sushi buffet place. From the reviews, they said their sushi was fresh. But the tuna roll I ordered was fishy and not enjoyable. Everything else was really nice, my FAVORITE FAVORITE part was the menu ! The menu itself was such a genius way of showcasing the foods they offer"
2368,3_pn5nxp9NuGv7tJ61Mslw,2/28/2020,3 star rating,"This place caught our eye because it had special and interesting pricing that I've never seen before. The menu had two different prices on it : the regular prices and the discounted prices. You can unlock the lower prices if you buy the komorebi special which includes a soup, and salad for $10 per person. The seats/booths were wooden and surprisingly super tight. Most people on the bigger side wouldn't be able to fit comfortably. In all honesty, it all pretty much comes out to the same price as AYCE minus maybe $10-15 cheaper than AYCE (at least for my party this was the case). I was kind of disappointed at the selection of special rolls. They were super similar to one another with maybe one or two ingredients changed between each one. Fish was fresh, service was okay. Wait time is long and waiting area is super cramped, so be prepared for that."

I ordered one of the big sushi + sashimi platters with a stir fry beef udon for 3 adults and 1 toddler. The stir fry udon was good - flavorful, not too saucy or salty, perfect for my toddler and mom with high blood pressure.  The fish is good - not omakase grade but it does it's job and definitely hits the spot when you're having a sushi craving. Prices are extremely reasonable. We are definitely including this place in our dinner rotation!"

2373,3_pn5nxp9NuGv7tJ61Mslw,3/6/2020,4 star rating,"Interesting concept for this restaurant where if you dine in, you pay a $10 base fee to ""unlock"" the cheaper prices. For example a tuna roll is $3 but if you opted for the option to pay the $10 base fee you could get the roll for $1. I think it's worth it if you don't want to over stuff yourself by going to an all you can eat but you still want variety. The special rolls were $2 and the sushi pieces were $1 for 3 pieces which was not bad. I came with a group of 5 others and our bill ended up to be $107 before tips. The food was not bad and it didn't take long to come out either. It was actually pretty cool they brought out all our rolls on this massive square wooden board. The location is also convenient since it's on the corner of the fort Hamilton train station. The place got pretty packed at night and I came on a weekday."

Went back and the barista gave us new drinks but nothing had improved. I think it's honestly and educational opportunity as an adjustment in water:coffee ratio can be adjusted!I really think I've found my coffee shop. The coffee has a purpose, everything they contain their coffee and delicious baked goods is compostable. I love walking in and smelling what they've got in the oven.

Extremely cold and not welcoming, this is a guy who needs to get over himself - terrible attitude and terrible first impression. Secondly, I was expecting an impressive and at the very least, flavorful, latte. I paid $5 for a medium hazelnut latte and what it tastes like is a cup full of steamed milk. I cannot taste even a hint of espresso or hazelnut. Of all the days I need caffeine, you give me a cup of warm milk. Ugh.

They have a variety of options for how you would like to have your eggs cooked, and if a breakfast place has this I prefer to order over easy eggs. First time I ordered the eggs were raw, barely cooked with egg whites still clear all throughout the sandwich. While it did ruin my morning, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and next time I ordered I got the over medium eggs (hoping they would be cooked this time). To my surprise, they were even WORSE. Cooking eggs isn't difficult, and I get they might be very busy and want to save time but raw eggs is unacceptable. Never eating here again."

How can they be so good sometimes and then be so awful? It goes back to my first review...the staff is a hit or a miss. They are in such a rush that they miss the mark many times.

This restuarant serves Ayuvedic cuisine which is healthy balanced food. Their cuisine is vegetarian and vegan with no usage of garlic and onions. When I arrived for early dinner there was outdoor dining and it was packed. So I decided to do indoor dining and I was the only one in the restaurant. Hostess who was also my server took my temperature and I even completed a contact tracing form in order to eat indoors. Staff was welcoming and menu looked interesting. The ambiance of this restaurant is zen like. The menu also offered a 3 course prix fixe menu for $33. Overwhelmed with choices I asked the server for recommendations and I went with all of the recommendations for appetizer, entree and dessert. For the appetizer I ordered the vegan mozzarella plate and omg this dish was to die for. The vegan mozzarella was picked and prepped so well that it made me forget that I was eating mozzarella. Definitely a must order dish. For the entree I went with the vegetarian lasagna which was MASSIVE and I ate only half of it and took the other half to go. FYI this dish can also be made vegan. The lasagna was one of the best vegetarian lasagna I have ever had. Can't wait to come back to try the vegan lasagna. For the dessert I tried the rose chocolate mousse which is to die for. The rose scent throughout this dish blew mind as I devour the raw chocolate mousse.  I closed out my meal with the heart opening tea and my food experience had a happy ending. This restuarant also offers Ayuvedic cooking classes and certification course. If you're in the area, this is a great vegetarian/vegan place to eat in. Can't wait to come back."

The savory waffle and vegetable pancake were amazing and so tasty that we swallowed the food while humming internal singing praise. Both (and everything on the menu) were free of refined flour, made with quality house made ancient grain flour. Truly felt nourished after the meal. The carob cake and the very long name tea that tastes like hot chocolate were incredible. The cake especially was the best ""chocolate"" I've had (refined sugar free!). We even saw the chef Divya at the restaurant today!"

Had a child requiring high chair . Informed the waitress that we had called before 1pm for dinner reservation and requested a better place . The restaurant was not even full. I clearly knew it was because of our skin color. We are South Asian Indians eating in a restaurant mostly cooking Indian food !! Was truly disappointed . Also, the table next us - opened her napkin & they found a live, big cockroach in it. We decided to stay as we had already ordered the food . The hostess was more keen on removing our food items even when we were still eating. Very disappointed. This restaurant is not even worth one star."

They have tridoshic meals, and if you know your dosha you can mix and match. I got the vegan lasagna and my friend got the kale dish. So honestly the food came out fast, which usually means pre made. The lasagna was way over cooked. Meaning they pre made it and cut it and reheat the whole thing every time someone orders because my veggies were yellow. Good portion size, but already too soggy and tasted over cooked. The sauces are delicious as well, good pesto and bbq sauce. Also, the server seemed a bit pushy into getting us to order and we were talking and catching up. I might come again and try another dish to see if it's pre made or not."

As in, the thing you can literally only get at Hawaii or Disney World. There is no in-between. Anyway, back to the bowl.The rice was too gummy. Noted on the first bite and served as an unfortunately persistent shadow for the rest of the meal.

There were a total of 7 of us so we were in and out often trying to figure out what to get and what to eat. I went the register to place my order, and halfway through I got a sassy comment from one of the workers that I needed to have placed my order at another counter. I explained that I hadn't ever been there before and so I had no idea, but I would do that in the future. The snarky comment didn't need to have been made, but she could have nicely explained that these items are typically ordered over there. Cool. That's all they needed to say. We ordered a few bagels with cream cheese, and I asked the counter staff to confirm that the bagels didn't have any egg products on them (my son has a diagnosed egg allergy) and the counter staff said it did. I asked if they could confirm it, and after asking the chef, the chef was able to definitively say that this was false and there were no egg products in the bagels. My boys happily polished off half a bagel each and 3/4ths of a vegan carrot muffin. Our out of town family also enjoyed the bagels, fruit cup, and other pastries they tried. I also got an iced mocha and another family member got a latte. They did a great job with our drinks. My husband and I also enjoyed our bagels, and the various pastries we also got such as a plain, glazed donut and an almond croissant which we took for later. I've had Orwasher products before from farmer's markets, but I have to say that the in store experience and products were much better. The outdoor seating they have set up at this location is also very nice, and shaded, which I appreciated in the July heat."

Small things sometimes can make a big difference.  This isn't about the money or a free loaf of bread.  It is the principle of the matter.   This pandemic did not only affect businesses.  It affected individuals too and things like reward cards brighten up people's day.  This incident made me feel like this brand only cares about the bottom line and profits and does not care about or appreciate their customers.  This used to be my family and friends' go to place to purchase bread, cake and pastries since the day they opened.  Now we will take our business somewhere else.  Paris Baguette, you have lost a bunch of long time customers due to your poor customer relations and service.-----------------------------------------------So just an update on how the 'follow up' went:  I did indeed get a direct message asking for my contact info so a manager can reach out to me which I supplied.  To date, no one has reached out to me.   As you can see in their response (see attached) they claim they are very sorry for what happened, they appreciate my business and customer service is their 'top priority'.  If that is the case, why don't they just fix it and allow me to redeem my reward card?  What is so complicated??  What else is there to discuss?  I clearly stated what happened and showed my full reward card.I also read some of the other reviews and it seems like Taylor just copies and pastes the same generic response to all negative reviews.  I suspect the DM message is also a template so they can look good on social media but not really fix anything.  I have no respect for businesses that are run this way and I don't appreciate BS apologies.  I can't, I just can't!!"

Don't make me choose between them - b/c I won't do it!  The jerk is spicy but not too spicy to send you home cryin'.  It has just the right amount of heat in each bite.  And the curry?  It's got this warm smokiness to it.  It's gotta have some cinnamon mixed in there which takes the curry to the next flavor level.  There's so much depth in these little patties.Patties are $2.50 a piece and when I say little I don't literally mean little. These guys are decent in size.  I'd say one is a good sized snack and two could easily work for a meal.Anytime I know I'm going to be in Prospect Heights I make sure I've got cash on me so I can pick up a couple patties.  If you haven't tried them yet - please do!  But save a couple for me b/c chances are I'm on my over there right now.  ;-)

Everyone I bring comes back how is it that I'm from Connecticut and found this golden gem and these people have lived in Brooklyn their whole life they serve food Wednesday through Saturday tell about 7:45 but come early because they sell out quick Their bakeries off the hook they have cookies made daily along with beef patties and Coco bread

If you've lived your life feeling satisfied indulging in patties sporting the yellowish, cracker-like shell, your mind will be blown when you try the homemade deliciousness of Miss Muffin's homemade dough/pastry. It's soft flakiness surrounds and perfectly complements the meaty, juicy fillings. I love the spicy beef and jerk chicken varieties - but they have many options. Their goods are always fresh and they do run out. So stop in on the early side, or call ahead. And bring cash."

This spot totally surprised me; thought it would be one of those pretentious kale-and-almonds-in-a-jar and was ready to roll my eyes.But that was until I saw the price of the bowl - just $13 - for what turned out to be this delicious assortment of tender, fresh chicken, beans, yummy rice, and creamy guacamole. Grabbed it and ate with my dog Gerbert on a bench in Washington Square. Livin' the dream! 5 stars!!!!!"

I always drink broth at home as a pick me up when I'm hungry or feeling under the weather so having this is ultra convenient for NYU students. I got some food for the first time, I'd rate that alone 3 stars but considering it's freshness, locally sourced ingredients, & the 5star broth I opted for a 4 star. The spaghetti bolognese was a little bland & they didn't drain the zucchini enough so it was a bit of a watery mess, maybe better to eat in store and not to-go. I also got the side of sweet potato which was good but tiny for $5.Highly recommend this place for broth, coffee or other healthy snacks. I appreciate the effort to make healthy food so will try it again."
2469,1yqrirjDVm40roP-NcU-Ig,10/30/2018,3 star rating,"Broth - that is what you get here. Especially if you've made some questionable decisions about food and drink before coming to Springbone. For those who prefer to chew their food, like me, there is an extended menu with other options. Pretty pricey food on that menu, but hey, it's sourced locally and the ingredients just taste so CLEAN. Feed me all the paleo food you got and I am a happy girl. I got the beef chilli bowl, which had a lot of quinoa and a decent amount of ground up beef. It was really tasty; the sweet potato complemented the ingredients so well. But the portions you get here are disappointing for the price, so keep that in mind when coming here.  Tried the Mexican Bowl, and that was great. Tons of black beans, rice, and guac. The broth it comes with (on the side in a sample cup) was delicious! Now that I trust these people, I know I'm coming back for that! They were sadly out of the mushroom tea, so I got a plain herbal tea. It was alright, pretty simple, tasted like hot water. Love that they're open relatively late for the area and that their staff is pretty friendly. Their lack of space and a bathroom are whack, so just keep those in mind before stopping in. There's just a counter space and a picnic table, with there being seats for about 7-8 people. It's tight so don't come here for intimate conversations. Keep it casual, NYU students!Suggestion: add calorie and protein counts to your menus. You'll attract so many more diners!"

Bright interior with a large menu to the side for some quick healthy meal options.Wasn't all that hungry, so settled on the medium Spicy Vegan Broth ($8). A warm mixture of mushroom broth, garlic, turmeric, and hot sauce served in what looks like a coffee cup. Easy to drink, as the hot sauce gave it a nice kick after each sip.Solid choices for actual meals as well; probably best for a healthy lunch."

So I probably was not the target audience of their meals.I came inside Springbone Kitchen, not for the healthy alternatives to the most commonly eaten foods, but because I liked the way the place looked from the outside.We gave our order to an absent-minded guy who only after ordering remembered that they were out of Spaghetti and Meatballs. After another failed attempt at ordering Grandma's chicken and rice (turns out they run out of dishes a lot), we finally settled on the Mexican bowl.The Mexican bowl came with the blandest chicken I've ever had at a restaurant. I get that the chicken is free-range, but it would have continued to be free-range if only they have seasoned it. The wild rice tasted like they scraped the bottom of the pot and scooped the burnt ends (maybe they were running out of wild rice too?) to reach that concoction of hard rice with no flavor whatsoever. The beans were not seasoned (surprise!) and although they did a good job with the guac (don't know how you'd mess up guac anyway), there was just not enough of it to salvage that dish."

I really like the ambiance of the place. It was very clean. The staff was friendly. I ordered my salad with mesclun greens, dried cranberries, beets, cucumbers and grape tomatoes with ranch dressing on the side. That was $7.99 plus tax. I like how everything they give you is branded including the salad bowl. The napkins and the paper bag had their logo on it. I have to say this was not a very salad. It didn't taste super fresh. The beets were very hard but then again I don't like my beets shredded into fine pieces and their grape tomatoes were cut into pieces which I don't like. I think they should peel their cucumbers. This is all preference though. And the portion was very small. The part I dislike the most was their ranch dressing. It reeked of garlic. I need Newman's or Ken's ranch dressing. I know that sounds bad that I prefer the prepackaged stuff.Overall, I find this to be a smaller, cheaper version than Chop't. I would get salads from a local deli or even a fast food restaurant.

First, whoever thought of making fried green plantains into a sandwich needs a Medal of Honor!!! Seriously! The flavors were everything! The cubano came with roast pork (my fav) sliced thick ham, fried cheese and pickles and it was smothered in a green verde sauce which they had on hand for dipping and was EVERYTHING!!! The sandwich was so big i finished half and the other half I'm about to heat up for breakfast. Absolutely delicious! The service was perfect for it to be late night and they were closing in 30 mins. The cashier was patient, she explained the menu and even brought our food to our tables. They ask for your name when you order, so when she does bring it to you, it's a personal touch.

En todo momento le hablé en español y con respeto(porque lo oí hablando en español con el cocinero) y el me seguía hablando de vuelta en inglés.

However when it came to the food, everything kinda fell short. We were told that the kitchen was very busy (perhaps understaffed?) so I'm not sure if that's to blame.We ordered 3 dishes and they all seemed too heavy in flavor, especially the banh xeo and braised lamb ragout broad noodles. The beef in the pho bo was amazing in flavor and texture but the bowl/broth was unfortunately lukewarm when it got to our table. The dishes lean more American-fusion than traditional, which could be good if you're into that.Despite the disappointment, our drinks were nice and again the back patio is a ~vibey~ spot for a date or catchup with friends."

We kept passing by places that had no seating or weren't serving food. We got in with 10 minutes to spare at bricolage. The service was friendly walking in and we got seated fairly quickly without a reservation. The table we were sat at was so sticky that our hands and gloves were sticking to the table just being placed on it. I'm sorry thats gross and we probably should've gotten up there.We put in our orders my friend ordered the pork belly dish and I ordered the bricolage breakfast. They both came out in reasonable time and our water was always refilled. I ordered a hot black coffee and my friend ordered a vietnamese coffee hot. Neither of the coffees came to the table hot both were lukewarm and both tasted old and bad. Also the prices were offensively high $5 for a black coffee and $6 for a vietnamese coffee.My breakfast came with bacon and was originally $19 I told them I don't eat bacon and could I swap it for potatoes or salad. They swapped it for potatoes and then upcharged me $4 without telling me . This made me pretty annoyed and we got up and left.The actual breakfast I ordered was alright the French toast being the best part. The eggs tasted very ordinary something you could get at a hotel buffet. Overall we agreed that we would not come back.

The owner actually told me to send him the name of my children's school so he could call them.

Meanwhile, he used derogatory language and was incredibly unkind to a crying customer who was trying to patronize his small business.So, despite cancelling my gift cards, he has also not refunded me my hundreds of dollars."

It's heated and, while I kept my jacket on, it was perfectly fine to sit in on a chilly night. The food was excellent, starting with the absolutely phenomenal crispy imperial rolls. That was the night's favorite, although the Honey, Ginger & Garlic Glazed Salmon and the Spicy Garlic Noodles were big hits. For something fresh and light, I also recommend the papaya salad. The drinks were also excellent; I loved the spice melange."

It has a vintage tiny tvs spread across the entire interior, the bathrooms, and a lot of plants. The food smelled delicious! Giving this place a 4 star instead of a 5 star because it's way too overpriced for decent Vietnamese food. The service was decent, staff were friendly! what we ordered. Five Spiced Fried Chicken & Waffles 5/5 The best item we ordered. Chicken cooked perfectly, flavor was superb. Would order this again! Vietnamese coffee: 2/5 The flavor was not good. Tasted like water downed coffee. Would not order again. Pho bo: 3.5/5 They say the broth is simmered for 24 hours. Was expecting it to be bursting with flavor, however  this broth tasted a bot bland. The beef was good, but very expensive for a mediocre soup priced at $24"

Think a garden filled with antiques.  Inside looks pretty cool also, but a little tight.Service: friendly and efficient! for the win!Food: delicious! The unshaking beef & eggs was so good. My husband had  the  Spicy Garlic Noodles (very spicy-beware). Our friend had the lamb buns and also said they were great.Drink: Vietnamese coffee was so yummy. The cocktails are a bit pricey but also great."

If you were to order one thing, definitely go for the spicy garlic noodles. As the waiter described it ""It can be a little spicy"", but if you are a fan of Thai chilis it will be amazing. Noodles were sparingly and the shrimp grilled to perfection."

Ambiance 5/5Food 3.4/5Drinks 2/5 Service 4/5Starting with the chicken and waffles, the chicken portion was HUGE compared to the tiny waffle that came with it (pictured: and no, phone did not eat first surprisingly!) depending if you prefer a ton of fried chicken to your waffle this might be perfect for you. We had to get the pad Thai as this was a Thai restaurant and I would give it a 3.5/4. I ordered the spicy chicken salad which was delicious I loved the spicy salad but the chicken was ginormous and had to be broken down to accompany the salad. 4/5Last but not least the fruit pancake roti was super sweet and yummy. If you like sweets for brunch - order this!"

2518,TynT1ykBkQhXd6nuTK6JUQ,4/16/2023,3 star rating,This is a restaurant with great ambiance and indoor decor. A pretty place for a weekend brunch with friends . Quite decent menu with bottomless mimosas for lunch. Service is above average as this place is crowded & needs prior reservation . Cant wait to try other items on the menu !
2519,TynT1ykBkQhXd6nuTK6JUQ,10/13/2022,4 star rating,"A modern thai restaurant with a beautiful garden in the back decorated with florals. We started off with a lychee flavored mocktail, and expresso martini (virgin). For appetizers we had the watermelon salad which was perfect for summer. We also had spring rolls served w/ rice noodles & sweet lime peanut sauce which were delicious. For entrees, we had their green curry (asked for only vegetables, no meat) made extra spicy with a crispy roti. We really enjoyed that and also ordered a side of home fries."
2520,TynT1ykBkQhXd6nuTK6JUQ,8/17/2022,4 star rating,"Cute little thai place with a seasonal menu so don't be surprised if you don't see what you want! Love the ambience of their outdoor setting, very intimate and instgrammableHere's what we got: - Happy hour rose sangria: 4/5 - happy hour oysters: 4/5 love the sauce that it came with, paired really well although oysters were really tiny - crispy pork chili basil: 4/5 delicious crispy pork with sweet taste - khao soi short rib: 2.5/5 short rib fell right off which was the best part but the khao soi itself was very disappointing; super dense and salty which made it hard to devour; and there were only about 2 bites of noodles... I'd come back to try their other stuff since it's a seasonal menu!"
2521,TynT1ykBkQhXd6nuTK6JUQ,8/27/2022,5 star rating,"Fantastic Thai brunch spot, especially if you can sit in the back garden area! I ordered the Roti with Banana and Coconut Palm Sugar ($20), which was amazing - the roti were like light Thai style pancakes with a truly delicious coconut palm sugar sauce to go with the seasonal fruit on top. The overall flavor was a perfect sweetness with the coconut flavor and creaminess of the sauce. It was just a bit hard to cut with the dull knife they provided but it was more than worth the effort of cutting.I also tried the Pad Thai Sunrise ($22), which was delicious as well. On top of the normal ingredients, this one was a bit special since it included apple slices, runny egg, and red cabbage (Pinto Garden prides itself on its creative food offerings). The apple added some unique sweetness and crunch to complement the savory noodles. The prices of the dishes are also reasonable.To drink, I got the Lychee Soda ($6), which was surprisingly good. I'm not really a soda fan but this one seemed house-made and had a great natural lychee flavor with a refreshing fizz. The restaurant also has a great selection of brunch cocktails if you're looking for that.The most famous part of Pinto Garden is the beautiful garden seating area in the back. It is covered with lots of natural sunlight. It is a bit cramped and noisy in there but still a very aesthetic and enjoyable dining experience there - there are flowers all around which are fake but still look nice. The service speed was fast and the staff were pretty friendly. We were seated for brunch right away on a Sunday without a reservation.Overall, Pinto Garden is a must-try spot if you are looking for a nice NYC brunch spot that offers more than just the typical American brunch options."
2522,TynT1ykBkQhXd6nuTK6JUQ,1/24/2023,4 star rating,"Pinto Garden tries to ""upscale"" their food, and it's reflected in the pricing. The flavors were more interesting and portions were smaller. Their apps in general aren't worth it, except their shrimp donuts, which were actually really good, especially with the sauce. Their coconut crab fried rice was loaded with crab. The short rib noodles could use more sauce and (regular) noodles. They put a TON of the fried noodles -- too much imo. Flavors were great for their entrees, less so for the apps. Again, skip the apps minus the shrimp. Get another entree if you need more food.They have a cool heated patio/garden but I personally was not particularly impressed. It was also really easy to get a reservation which is good if you're last minute."
2523,TynT1ykBkQhXd6nuTK6JUQ,6/17/2022,4 star rating,"Smol lil spot, perfect for aesthetic brunch vibes with the girls. Make a reservation and sit in the back garden. Trust me. We ordered some delish brunch items and my fave was the roti with berries. The other two were good but not special enough for me to get again tbh. The lychee bellini was really good. I'd go for bottomless if you were really wanting to get intoxicated lol.It is a small tight restaurant so just a warning. And if its loud, it may be hard to hear your friends."
2524,TynT1ykBkQhXd6nuTK6JUQ,8/17/2022,4 star rating,Excellent food!! The service can be an inch better but overall I'll recommend this resturant. They came out with my friend's food and not mine for over 5 minutes which meant we couldn't eat together. It was fixed and the food was yumm. Loved my dish; fried pork belly with congee was like having grits!! Delish. My friends enjoyed their food as well. The drinks are pretty but they are nothing to rave home about in my opinion. If you get outdoor eating it's instaworthy out there. Will be going back to try their roti pancakes and to have the congee again.
2525,TynT1ykBkQhXd6nuTK6JUQ,6/2/2022,4 star rating,"Cute outdoor seating with a spring feel. It can get a little loud since the space is a little small (indoors and outdoor). Highly recommend making a reservation because it does get really packed! The food is very authentic and delicious. I deducted a star because the prices are on the higher end and it can feel slightly cramped since all the tables are very close to each other. My friend and I did have to raise our voice a few times because we couldn't hear other due to the background noise. Covid is still going on, I would recommend spacing the tables out a little more"

Nothing like a huge omelette and some pancakes to start the day.  I showed up at a pretty busy time in the morning and was promptly seated.  The staff was friendly and brought my coffee out right away; the coffee was surprisingly good too. My food was brought out piping hot in just a few minutes; so if you have no patience, this is your spot. I know that this is a chain but overall my experience was great.  It's a no frills kind of place but if you want a good breakfast and you need to get going fast, stop by."

Once my birthday breakfast arrived I knew something was wrong because I am not a fan of French toast. Because I waited 20 mins already I took it, said my grace and dug right in. It was amazing. The food was hot and I did not waste time looking up. IT is one of the Worse Birthday BREAKFAST to date. LOLPlease go to the IHOP off Rockaway by east new york area.

They had just opened 3 months ago!Super nice owner that also happened to be a Cornellian! She told me a lot about the trending/upcoming beers. The bartender was from the UK and super friendly as well. If you're flying solo, this is a great bar to find people to chat with and enjoy craft beer."

The drinks tend to be very expensive, and it's the only place I've been to that has a two drink minimum for trivia. This was fine for me, as I would have gotten those anyway, but I am not a fan of the protocol. Otherwise everything here was fine. Service was good, the drinks were good, the cocktails list seemed pretty good, though very expensive. I guess I'm just not used to Manhattan prices, being from Queens."

I took a tiny taste & asked if she could add more vodka to offset the sweetness and I would be happy to pay. She said sure & took the drink and brought me back another 1/2 glass & charged me another $10. $25 for the same half glass. Ridiculous!Bora, I took a lip taste and the Lilette Blanc was too sweet for me so I asked her to add more Tito's for an extra price since my husband and I were planning on staying for a while. She took the glass which fully poured was a 1/2 glass (which is fine-it's all alcohol), only to bring me back another 1/2 drink (possibly less than the first) and charged me another $10. What did I pay the extra for? Why not just charge me for an extra shot and add it to the drink? It made no sense  How was the first quantity $15 and the replacement same quantity $15+$10-I only received one 1/2 glass drink?"

2582,oIUdTViTYGfY9Tp6N8IfoQ,4/9/2019,4 star rating,"It's not worth taking off a star - but this is one of those bars that doesn't modify the price of their beer to accommodate tax, leading to a beer that's $8 or $9 and random change. So really, it's $10 or $11, because you look like a cheapskate picking the coins out of the plastic envelope your bartender returns your change in. I have stopped coming here because $11 for a beer is too much."

Solid beer selection with some really delicious sour beers, lots of outside seating on 2nd Ave and the owner is one of the nicest guys ever and really works hard to make this a great neighborhood bar."
2584,oIUdTViTYGfY9Tp6N8IfoQ,6/14/2017,4 star rating,"Oh NYC - you're forever changing. One day while walking on 2nd Ave I noticed there was an overhaul of storefronts and Workshop was one of those new locations that popped up. After a toasty Saturday in Central Park, my boyfriend and I were ready for our next drink. Given Workshop showed up on Beermenu's with a pretty decent selection, we decided to try it out. Around maybe 6:30 PM on Saturday, the bar was pretty quiet. The space is super clean cut and with a name like Workshop you can expect it to be like well ... a workshop. I think the owners are still trying to finalize and wrap up the decor has it seemed a little random but I'm sure it'll get there. We snagged the window seats because it's always fun to people watch while sippin' on a brew. If you're into beer - then this is a good spot for you. The cocktail menu also looked pretty fun. I can imagine based off the beer menu they'll continue to have a good to decent rotation and will do their best to compete with Pony Bar. I have no reason to sound super educated on beer right now as I can only say mine was cloudy and that's how I like it. The bartender (who I'm assuming is also the owner) was super friendly. They have a nice lil menu of snacks to dabble in as well. I had the Buffalo Chicken Taco ($3) which was super tasty and packed some nice heat as well. We also got the olives which was a small starter but a pretty decent selection. I would certianly go back - as any new place working out the kinks nothing is ever set in stone. Worth a pit stop on the way by or a new spot to grab beers in this rotating city."

It delivered the flavorful punch of a traditional Caribbean curry plate while still being veggie-filled. I had a side of the steamed cabbage and mac and cheese. Definitely would order again.

Their baked goods are tasty as well, I reccomend the Cassava Pone.I would give 5 stars for food but 3 for customer service. I use to be a frequent customer but their customer service needs some work. The ladies there always seem to have an attitude, I don't know if it's with me personally. But when my food was ready one of the staff shouted in a rude manner, shoved the food on the counter, and walked away.A man that was standing on line saw the disrespect, he met with my eyes and greeted me while looking back at the cashier in disbelief. The cashier herself, seemed to notice her behavior did not go unwarranted. The male staff never have a problem with anyone and are always warm and polite. The sistahs need to work on their customer service or find a new career. I won't be going back anytime soon.Smh, I love to support Black owned business but showing respect and appreciation to your customers is a must!"

(Chicken spinach salad) Which all the ingredients use doesn't even cost 20$. Than the chicken kabab again 18$ not worth the price. The amount they serve you is stupid. You get more food in a halal cart for half or less of the price. Food is not worth it. Rather drive to Brooklyn cheaper and better tasting food. The portion isn't worth the price.

There wasn't the mass confusion fromLast time. There were actual waiters and waitresses. I was very happy! Really disappointed with Thai rock tonight. I ordered a frozen piña colada and a mango salad with shrimp. Paid at the bar I was told to sit down with my number and wait for my number to be called of the loudspeaker. That's how they're doing things now. Waited patiently while everybody else around me was getting their food. I finally asked what was taking so long with a simple mango salad with shrimp? The hostess looked into it for me. They lost my order. She asked me if I had my receipt. I showed her my number and she said no she didn't need the number she needs the receipt. I found the receipt. Waited some more. She informed me they would expedite my salad. I, again stressed to her I wanted shrimp with the salad. She apologized and assured me I would be getting my order. It took so long I asked for them to make it to go, because I was really tired. Got home and of course my salad did not have shrimp.  I must've said that I wanted a mango salad with shrimp at least five times to various people there. Very"

LOL I'll get back to that other spot shortly.It was very confusing figuring out how to get to the outdoor dining to this place.  They definitely need more signage in the front with arrows where to walk. When I arrived I was unimpressed with the ambiance. I am not sure what I was expecting but it seemed very blah. I know exactly what it was I had just left a jumping, nice music playing spot called Bungalow Bar right next door and wished I was over there. LOLI love waterfront restaurants but this one wasn't as charming. We ordered our food and both agreed the place was a bit pricey for Thai food. I ordered the lychee mojito and my friend had a ginger mojito and we both enjoyed them. For entrees, I order the chicken basil fried rice and my friend had a curry stir fry dish. (forgot the name)  We agreed the food was good. We didn't like that they brought our food out in to go containers. We definitely understand COVIC times it just felt weird and kind of took away from the overall dining experience. The staff were friendly and service was prompt. We did enjoy the walk around the water views around the restaurant after dinner and watching people jet ski. With limited places with outdoor seating this is a cool spot to check out if you're in the area.  However, my friend and I agreed we will return to check out the spot next door. LOL"
4,URflNuIV5PJZm4LcNACBPQ,6/13/2020,4 star rating,"I was in the mood for Thai tonight and a friend found a place in the water we were hoping would have the outdoor seating available during this pandemic of 2020. Behold found this place next to Cross Bay Bridge by Beach 92nd st and Rockaway Beach blvd. Because of the pandemic, they were not open for sit down for another 2.5 weeks. The place is right next to Bungalow and upon arrival, you may think its a small place due to the small entrance. The place opens up in the back on the water. We placed our order by yelp and it said at least 30 mins before it would be done. We arrived there 45 mins prior to closing. There were a few people waiting for their pickup orders, and we decided to wait until they all left for social distancing.  When we got in, Robert greeted us and let me tell you, he was very welcoming and gracious for us to come. They also prepared cocktails from the menu. Of course you are not allowed to drink outside, only for takeout. The lychee martini was to die for. Maybe I had not had one in a while with the lock down, but it was damn good. I had 2 of them and made me a happy camper. I ordered Tom Yum soup, fried calamari, mango salad and house fried rice with shrimp and squid. The calamari was not oily at all. The Tom yum was good and flavorful.  The mango salad was really good, i almost went back for another one. The rice was not bad. May have been a little pricier than I expected. Brought it home to my son who left not trace of it and at 11pm. The drinks is what really made it. When I woke up the next day, no ill effects and certainly no headache so they use good liquor. I would certainly return to try more items on the menu, but i would definitely return for Robert who was just so open and welcoming.  It also seemed most regulars who were picking up knew him well. What a great demeanor!"

It took another 10 min just to get drinks and then 40 min to get our food. The server did not come to our table one to check on us or ask us if we needed anything. Just to track someone down was a hustle. The food was average we got chicken pad Thai and beef pad see ew and it was okay I've had better and for the price here it wasn't worth it. I also understand there's a live band but the volume was beyond unbearable I couldn't even hear myself talk. We asked if the volume can be lowered just a tiny bit but of course we were ignored as usual. I won't be returning here nor will I be recommending anyone to come here.

22,ynQ8NJB7SEAIkuUxopHPvA,7/20/2021,4 star rating,"Ignazio's was the first pizza we tried in New York. I was super picky about wanting to eat a good cheese pizza and this spot did not disappoint. We started off with:*Caesar Salad: This was a refreshing touch as we hadn't had greens during our trip. Although it was slightly over-dressed, It was really good.*Garlic Bread: The bread was warm and garlic-y, as it should be. The paprika on top made it have more of a spicy kick.*The Pizza: Your basic cheese pizza but elevated with fresh mozzarella versus the shredded kind. I liked how the mozzarella slices were scattered around and not all over the slice. The tomato sauce had the perfect tang to it. I smothered this with oregano and it was delicious.As someone who doesn't live in NY, I initially thought the service was slightly off. It's more of a ""what do you want?!"" than a ""what can I get ya?"" Our friends explained the atmosphere is pretty much like that all the time so we let it sink in. With that said, we had a great time and enjoyed the food. Cheers!"

This time, I had more l success.I got two slices, and I took them over to nearby Brooklyn Bridge Park to try them out. I also heard that the crust is so crispy that it will echo across the river if you listen close enough.Hehe, it really does!The crust is perfectly cooked here. Like better than Juliana's and Grimaldi's, okay, maybe I am stepping out of line on the latter. It is amazing. The rest of the slice is solid but nothing too crazy. It is very heavily seasoned with oregano, and the sauce has some sweetness to it (lots of sugar I can tell), but the cheese has some nice pull and tastes homemade and that is something that can not be taken away. These are also big slices, so I will not complain about the $8 (cash only - warning) total for two slices. See for yourself.I would come back here for the sake of that amazing crust, which I can still hear echoing off the bridge and skyline."

Upon walking in we ordered a pie and asked to be seated we were told there isn't  any available seat available, although there were vacant seats. Two white ladies came in immediately after us and we're seated right away after bringing it To their attention, we were seated. However, the service we received was horrible. They ignored us while checking in on everyone else which made us feel like we shouldn't be there. I won't be visiting this establishment is anymore very displeased  ."

As with sister restaurants Bobo and Rosemary's, at Claudette you can expect a delicious plate of food crafted and servedwith care."

We did not come when it was busy at all, there were empty tables in and out of the restaurant. I can't comment on the food yet because guess what. We still have not received it. It might be the greatest thing i have ever put in my mouth but i am starving and literally about to walk out."

After visiting, though, I'd certainly be willing to come back again soon. I was hungry after not really having eaten dinner the night before, and was very pleased with the brunch portion sizes here! I got the house made granola as well as the salmon & eggs. Of the two dishes, surprisingly the house made granola ended up being my favorite. It was a great mix of salty and sweet, and I'd get this granola on its own if Claudette ever packaged/sold it! The salmon & eggs was also good, although the eggs were more-so a highlight here than the salmon, which seemed a bit on the dry side. But nevertheless, a well balanced dish overall!We got our food very quickly and plenty of water / drinks refills - nothing to complain about when it comes to service. Another solid brunch spot!"

35,tbg4gR3jUUllR28cySo2kg,8/28/2021,4 star rating,"I've been to Awash twice, and both times I got the Awash Special. If you eat beef, you NEED to get this dish simply because of the Special Kifto. It is this spicy beef tartare that is soooo addicting. I'll go around the platter and try every dish, but I always come back to the Special Kifto. It is seriously so good. Between my two meals at Awash (several months apart) I have noticed some slight discrepancies. The first time, I had a delicious cabbage dish on the platter and I was a little disappointed when it wasn't included on the platter on my second trip to Awash. Also, I was under the impression that injera refills were free, as they were the first time I went to Awash- however, the second time I went, when we asked for extra injera, the waitress (rather rudely) said we would have to pay extra. Usually, injera has been complimentary at every other Ethiopian restaurant I've been to. One additional note - I think the staff could be a little more liberal with the napkins, as Ethiopian food can get a little messy on the hands. Overall, though, amazing food! I will definitely be back."
36,tbg4gR3jUUllR28cySo2kg,7/22/2022,2 star rating,The Beg Tibs meal not great for $29. This was the only Ethiopian meal I've had where the meat tasted dried out. They should offer Awaze Tibs instead.

Now order again for this week. I think I will have to order every week. I was feeling depleted and immediately began to crave it's healing spices and ghee. This is like family cookout. Look at this deliciousness. They don't know me but I love them. Sambusa - delicious. I've had lentil and chicken. Both awesome though I like lentil more. Miser wat- perfectly flavorful and wonderful spiceAterkilt - delicious cabbage and carrot. I love that they don't cook the heck out of it so the veggies still have texture! This is the way to do it! Beg Alicha - I will marry this dish. So juicy. So well prepared that I smile while eating it. It's like the comfort of a warm embrace from a good friend. You can TASTE the care they put into their food here. I need to marry the cook, only way I can ensure happiness for life."

I tried the 19$ meat combination and 12$ Timatim Fit-fit. The fit-fit was overly spiced & oily. The rest of the food was ok - but it was better the last time I tried it. Since so many restaurants are struggling during the pandemic, I give extra credit to those able to remain open. Overall it was ok."

Everything was amazing! The atmosphere was so nice- we sat inside where the lights were dimmed and Ethiopian music was playing softly. Inside the light fixtures and decorations around were all beautiful. The staff was kind.Back to the food- in the meat platter every item, whether meat or veggie was seasoned differently so you really get so much variety! And everything tasted good and worked well together! The sambusa was delicious and had a great crunch to it- and was filled with heaping amounts of filling. The Walia beer was really good too. We will definitely be coming back here!"
43,tbg4gR3jUUllR28cySo2kg,5/9/2022,2 star rating,"The restaurant was empty when we arrived. The waitress told us to sit anywhere and brought the menu before going back to the bar. We asked for suggestions and she pointed out one beef item that not raw or spicy. Service was slow in a near empty restaurant. For someone not familiar with Ethiopian food, it would have been more helpful of the waitress to try to explain more of their dishes. Got the gursha for an appetizer. Not recommended, it was basically lentil and injera, which we also got with our meal. We ordered tib and doro wat. The tib was extremely tough, almost like chewing rubber and had no taste. The doro wat was only 2 pieces of small drumstick with one egg. That was not worth the price that was charged ($21). With the meal came a dish of injera, the lentil on the side was very firm. The waitress was busy on her phone by the bar and came quickly when we paid, otherwise we had to flag her down.  This is a great place to go if you just want to sit and chat with someone and not be bothered to order food or drinks. Perhaps we went during an off day."
44,tbg4gR3jUUllR28cySo2kg,4/15/2022,1 star rating,"HORRIBLE ""special kitfo"". Never heard/tested such a horrible thing. This is not our cultural kitfo at all. It is packed with raw onions and jalapeño and something else & all you feel like is throwing up. The supposed butter is actually some oil that stayed long and stinks. I couldn't believe what I was tasting and smelling. In addition to all of these, they didn't pack injera for the kitfo. My order was take out and I was stunned when opened the box. I think they wanted to take advantage of the extra 1 injera I bought for $3.25, assuming I would use that when I'm out of options. They were right, I ate that. So in essence I paid extra for this ""kitfo"" thing lol. They should be able to warn their customers if they customize the authentic ethiopian food. Plus their greed and low quality ingredients were all big disappointments for me."

Many different flavors, colors, and textures. All were fresh and blended well together. The meal included a drink & coffee. Of course, I had coffee and it was tasty and not as strong as I thought it would be, a good thing. For the drink, I had the Pineapple-Mint Caipirinha, this drink was awesome.

First off, it took at least 5 minutes for someone to come over with menus when I had made eye contact with the waitress several times.  Didn't matter to us much.  I noticed she was the only one working at 7pm on a Friday.  Poor girl was running around, good thing it was a small place.  Our appetizer came before our drinks.  The drinks had never came and my fiance went up to the bar and asked about them and the waitress said she will check with the bartender.  Clearly they were forgotten.  We got our dinner a couple minutes after finally getting our drinks and we both REALLY enjoyed the food. Maybe they were short staffed that night but the service made for a below average first experience.  Food made up for it though!"

Nice balance of salt and texture, and the farofa was on point. And to top it all off, I had cashew fruit juice - muito obrigado, Mari.

The soup was mediocre at best and very disappointing. The service was less than attentive or impressive considering that we were the only people in the place. We had to actually flag our waiter down to ask for things that normally a waiter would not have to be flagged down to ask for. Not to mention he never even checked back on us about.The place itself was also not that inviting. (This was before indoor dining got shut back down again.)Will pass on coming back here again."

My only issue is the bar, well, the whole place if I'm being honest, is small and the host(ess) will yell at you in the winter when you keep the door open for too long. I think they put out very consistent and great food it's just in a different style than what I grew up with. I'm from Texas so TexMex is what I'm used to and these guys do more authentic Mexican food. It is all delicious but just an fyi, if you're also a black bean soup lover and want to get it from here, your cravings will only be satisfied at dinner and not lunch time. I kinda love that for them. Not me but that's because I could (and do/have) eat soup for breakfast.

I am not a margarita type of person but how can you deny a slushy in the hot weather. The servers were very nice, attentive, and welcoming. I think our server's name was Marco? The place is packed with more of family seatings upstairs. Bar seating is available downstairs. The place is not very big and can get very loud from neighboring tables. But it didn't really bother me."
75,j4dGkqL-OK9YH8Sl2eOWEg,7/7/2022,4 star rating,"Towa is not a sushiya, although they do have some sushi/sashimi offerings. If you come here expecting sushi works, you're dumb and need to go home. Towa is what Japanese food actually tastes like in real Japanese homes, when overworked parents have no time to roll handmade sushi, so they, you know, cook food like every other culture. Towa is about homestyle Japanese comfort food, but through the Manhattan lens of slightly too high prices for slightly too small portions.- Umami Tomato: Not as umami as I would've liked, especially given that tomatoes have natural MSG. But the dashi jelly, chia seeds, and passion fruit pieces were refreshing, and it was nice that the entire thing was pre-sliced for our convenience.- Yasai Tempura: I wouldn't have chosen this myself, but my friend wanted vegetables (so she chose the deep fried kind?). We got avocado, okra, eggplant, pumpkin, lotus root, sweet potato, and shiitake mushroom in our platter.- Anago Katsu: One of the more unique items being that it's eel cutlet. Tasty but tiny. So, so tiny. Wish they'd given twice as much to justify the $25 price tag.- Nasu Dengaku: From the same friend who wanted vegetables. Forgettable grilled eggplant with surprisingly little flavor. The three kinds of miso were indeed colorful but had no taste.- Wagyu Ishiyaki: To quote Rihanna, ""This is what you came for"". Hear that sizzle and smell that beef? That's people cooking their thin slices of A5 wagyu beef on a hot stone. I love DIY hot stone grilling, and it's so hard to find in NYC these days. This was good, but again, too little. I could've done with at least 5 more slices of beef. The accompanying sauces (wasabi, yuzu kosho, miso, and soy) were a nice touch.- Seasonal Donabe: Undisputedly the star of the night. It takes 45 minutes to arrive, and girl, it's worth the wait! Traditional cooked rice in a clay pot with seasonal Japanese vegetables I rarely see even in Japanese restaurants (besides Kajitsu). The first bite instantly took me back to my childhood days eating the donabe made by my Japanese grandma. Don't expect a flavor bomb, here. Donabe is subtle, nourishing and comforting--just like grandma.- Sake Kasu Cheesecake: I love cheesecake as much as Kim Kardashian loves a selfie, and you can't come to a JP place and not have JP cheesecake. This one was decent but not the best--it tasted a bit burnt and the yuzu honey sauce was kind of overkill.Want to get your liquor on? The best bang for your buck is easily the $19 Sake Flight that lets you choose any 3 sakes from the list of 8 or so options (so get the most expensive ones, duh). And the pours are pretty generous too. Skip the B & R Highball.Service was the attentive, obsequious, sweet-toned service everyone associates with Japanese people. I'm not sure I'd schlep back to Towa exactly, but I also wouldn't be opposed if someone really wanted to go. I just wish there was a 10% discount I could apply to the bill to even out those high prices."
76,j4dGkqL-OK9YH8Sl2eOWEg,7/28/2022,5 star rating,"My partner and I celebrated our anniversary here last Saturday and it was a lovely time! We were treated to a scoop of green tea ice cream at the end of the meal which was so appreciated. Really great service overall, even though the food came out very slowly... We were there for 2.5, almost 3 hours (!!) Our server and the manager came over multiple times to apologize, though we weren't particularly in a rush so we didn't mind all that much. I just hope they aren't usually this busy!We both started off with the Long Peach cocktail ($16/each) which was a refreshing summer drink but a bit too sweet for me. The real reason we'd been wanting to come here though was because of the Wagyu Ishiyaki ($38) aka the DIY steak grilling platter. It was such a unique experience! We grilled about 7 pieces of A5 wagyu on a hot stone and they were just deeelicious. As wagyu lovers we also had to get the Wagyu Tataki ($25) app. The truffle butter paired SO well and we scarfed that down in seconds. We then had the Seasonal Donabe ($34) which had oysters (I believe) and fresh seasonal vegetables. I liked the clean, light flavor the rice had, but it seemed a bit too bland for us. It actually would've paired very well with the grilled wagyu (rice on the side), but this dish came a lot later as it typically takes 45 min to make. After trying a bowl, we decided to pack the rest of it home and not overfill ourselves with carbs. This claypot rice is probably best shared between ~4 people.Then we shared a Nigiri Set ($39) and the Uni Wagyu Maki ($38) - both were very good. Did I mention we are wagyu lovers? Can never get enough. I think the sleeper of the night, however, was the Ebi Mazemen ($25). I love a Japanese-style pasta dish done soo right. Unlike the rice dish, these were very tasty and flavorful carbs that we just devoured. The texture of the noodles was perfect.Finally, we ordered the Panna Cotta (hojicha flavored! $10) with our complimentary anniversary dessert. As non-dessert lovers we thought both were the perfect way to end the meal. We were very satisfied despite all the waiting in between each dish we ordered."

78,j4dGkqL-OK9YH8Sl2eOWEg,1/24/2023,4 star rating,"A modern take on Japanese cuisine, Towa had some yum dishes but their staff was what shined through for me. 1. Chawanmushi - super flavorful and soft2.  Toro - literally melt in your mouth omg3. Wagyu - was ok. Would recommend skipping4. Asari - also was not our fav and would recommend skipping 5. Maki - I personally didn't enjoy this. I thought the asparagus gave everything a weird texture and I didn't taste either the wagyu or uni6. Cheesecake - this was a miss for our group as well. The cheesecake was more dense than we expected and it didn't have much flavor7. Panna cotta - my group didn't loveeee this but I honestly thought it was really good. Def give it a try if you're into the hojicha flavor profileOverall I thought the experience at Towa was more meaningful than the food. The staff was so kind and tried to bring everything out steaming hot. We had a very large group so I appreciated how accommodating and patient they were with us. All the workers make conversation with us and give us their recommendations. Our waiter even gave me an off-menu drink he was working on! I think I'd like to come back and try other items."

The appetizers and drinks we got were delicious but the sukiyaki and duck breast soba was a bit disappointing. Will be back to try the Omakase!
80,j4dGkqL-OK9YH8Sl2eOWEg,5/1/2022,4 star rating,"Amazing service from start to finish. Came a bit early and had a lovely conversation with one of the waiters (unfortunately didn't get his name :/ ) before my friend arrived. They had just gotten their liquor license and he recommended the Highball and Greenwich as their top 2 cocktails. I typically don't like cucumber, but went out on a limb to get the Greenwich, which was well made and very refreshing as he suggested.For food, my friend and I ordered a la carte and got the edamame, sukiyaki nabe and each of us got a nigiri set. Before diving into each dish, I must say that the menu is a bit difficult to read. There are tons of pages, each with only a few dishes on them and a funny thin flappy paper between. Makes the menu seem fancy but tactically not the most intuitive.Food ------Edamame (5/5): They give lots of edamame, which is well seasoned, not too soft and a great start to the meal. Don't typically order edamame but this dish is definitely worth sharing if you enjoy edamame. The two of us couldn't finish the entire bowl, so beware that it's quite a bit.Sukiyaki Nabe (4.5/5): Good, with great flavors, but meat was a bit tough. Veggies throughout were great. Didn't come with rice but was good eaten alone too.Nigiri Set (3.5/5): Unfortunate since I wanted to check out the spot to see if I wanted to try the omakase at some point. The nigiri set included chu toro, salmon, unagi, ikura, hotate and some other pieces I don't remember. Hotate was a decent size and quite good. A lot of the other pieces I felt weren't too impressive. The sauces also didn't bring out the best of their flavors. Summary ------Their hot dishes were quite good and service was phenomenal. Bom explained each dish as it was brought out and also checked on how we were doing throughout, asking if I liked my cocktail when he saw I wasn't drinking it too quickly (I usually don't drink cold drinks until after most of my meal is done). Would come back to try their other dishes and enjoy the vibes!"

No liquor license yet (as of mid/late April) so BYOB.Kanpachi Carpaccio: 5/10- The fish was fresh but the toppings, esp the dill, didn't work well with the fish and ruined the dish for me.Ika Shumai: 6/10- These were interesting and creative in presentation, but taste was average. Yaka gani (grilled king crab): 7/10- Tasty bc king crab is always tasty, but it was a bit overcooked. Yasai tempura: 7/10- Standard but good tempura.Seasonal sashimi: 7/10- Very fresh fish that tasted good, but it was served at an incredibly cold temperature that made it a little off-putting.Kama hot soba with duck: 8/10- This was the best dish of the night. I didn't care for the duck at all but the soba and broth were good."
82,j4dGkqL-OK9YH8Sl2eOWEg,4/15/2022,5 star rating,"Towa is a new sushi restaurant that opened up that offers both a la carte dining and an omakase.We opted for the 9-course omakase, in which they offer only 2 seatings in the evening (5:30 PM or 8 PM) on Tuesdays through Saturdays, with only 8 slots.  I recommend in contacting the restaurant directly, as their online reservation system only shows the main dining area times and not the omakase seatings.Our omakase included:+Zensai - 3 kinds of seasonal appetizers+Sashimi Moriawase - assorted sashimi+Yakimono - grilled Spanish mackerel from Japan+Chef's Choice NIgiri - 4 pieces of nigiri+Suimono - fish-bone broth soup+Tempura - fried minced shrimp stuffed shiitake mushroom+Soba - pure buckwheat cold noodles+Chef's Choice Nigiri - futomaki, 5 pieces of nigiri, and a negitoro-taku temaki, served with a bowl of miso soup+Kanmi - pomegranate shiso gelatoMy favorites were the nigiri, the soothing fish-bone broth, and the housemade soba.Chef Masaya Shirai seemed very meticulous in his craft, and the whole staff at Towa were welcoming and kind.  We really enjoyed the attention to detail in all aspects of our dining experience.For those who care, the restrooms are gender-neutral, and the toilets are bidets with WARM seats - yesss!  The restaurant is nicely designed, and I especially liked the large windows at the front of the restaurant.Note that the noise level of the restaurant is a little loud, especially when there are larger parties in the dining area.Reservations are required.+Chef Shirai!+omakase+reservations required+friendly & welcoming staff+warm seated bidets!"

84,j4dGkqL-OK9YH8Sl2eOWEg,6/4/2022,5 star rating,"If you're looking to go out for an upscale Japanese dinner, Towa should be your list. Towa's aesthetics focus on earthy elements: wooden bamboo tables, textured plates & clay pots; it reflects the traditional Japanese culture focused on nature.The flavors are on point, whether it's the small dishes you're sharing tapa style or the delicious noodles or fresh sushi. What I love about Towa is that it focuses on bringing out the freshness of their ingredients. One to note would be that delicious umami tomato: a plump lightly sweet tomato with a bit of tartness of passionfruit & some savory mix of dashi broth. Another amazing dish to note would be the ebi shinjo; let's be honest: I was blown away because shrimp was finely minced and marinated, then wrapped in a thin rice paper that's perfectly fried. Blown. Away!!!Plus, service gets a thumbs up. We were celebrating my friend's birthday & the chef was so kind to write happy birthday on her dessert plate and the staff sang to her. (Oh, and the hoji cha pudding was BOMB. Must get!)Thanks for a fun girls night out, Towa! :)"

87,5ZgCfc1_fotAKUp7n3YJkQ,11/23/2018,4 star rating,"Located in Morningside Heights, Crepes on Columbus is a cute little diner-esque restaurant just outside of the Columbia University bubble. It's a great brunch place for many Columbia students trying to explore the neighborhood just a little bit more. Overall, the ambiance was quite pleasant, definitely giving off a much more small-town vibe in the city of New York. I came here with a few friends on a Sunday morning for brunch and we were seated immediately. Our server was pretty friendly, and was helpful in explaining some of the items that we didn't understand (don't worry, there aren't really that many complicated dishes...). Another great perk is that the coffee is unlimited refills (once again, adding to the diner vibe), which is great for anyone recovering from a hangover. I ordered the Goat Cheese Ratatouille, which was pretty tasty. The ratatouille isn't anything too special, but it does work well with the goat cheese. My friends got the pancakes (which was a pretty large serving size), the oeuf columbus crepe (which is actually kind of small), and an egg platter with meat (which definitely has enough food for a person). All in all, the food was pretty good, service was quick, and the unlimited coffee is definitely a plus. It's a great casual brunch location for smaller parties (4 or less) that isn't too crowded during peak lunch hours. I would definitely come back!"

Not only were they extremely pleasing to the eye, but they had the perfect crunch! I've had crepes in the past that were just way too soft and sort of slimy.

Its pretty shameless, they act as if people wont realize that they are being ripped off."
101,g8vu1G_fZLrPpGf2UHk6-Q,5/7/2019,5 star rating,"I can be a little picky when it comes to this type of food, so the ""Build Your Own Bowl,"" option is perfect for people like me. I get to choose exactly what I like and avoid exactly what I don't like. You can choose to have a poke bowl or a sushi burrito. I've had both, and I like the bowl much better because I can control how much I get of each ingredient, but the burrito was worth trying.I love the rewards card they offer. After 10 bowls or burritos, you get one free. What I love about their rewards program is you get one stamp for each bowl, rather than one stamp for each visit. It keeps me coming back to their store knowing I'm working towards a free meal. On top of the food, I can't come here without getting bubble tea too!  My personal favorite is the Frozen Taro bubble tea, but they have a ton of options to try!Overall, the place is always clean, usually quiet, and there's not usually a long wait.

All come with sushi white rice. This time I tried the signature Chicken poke. Chicken, cucumber, cilantro, scallion, chopped mango, sweet onion, crab salad, wonton crips, garlics crips, masago, sweet unagi sauce. I got so excited about a quarter of the way through that I knew I had to jump on and write this review right away. The flavors are amazing and everything tastes so fresh. This is now my favorite poke spot on the island. I ordered a fruit tea (passion fruit). It was refreshing but a little too sweet for me. They have a chill atmosphere and music pumping in the background. Place is just great. I can't wait to come back and try something new. Ask them for a poke card, after the 10th poke bowl you get one free $8.75 value. What are you waiting for! Get yourself a poke!

There was a crowd, but I guess most of the people were taking their coffee to go because my fiancé & I found seats very easily at the stools near the large front windows. The baristas were smiling & friendly, serving the customers easily.The only problem area is the order line. It's right up against the entrance door, & it causes some congestion & a little confusion (""Are you the end of the line? Oh, you ordered already?""). But other than that, I'm pleased we found this Starbucks. Because we were so comfortable, we ended up staying a little longer than planned.

But the joke was on me because after five / seven minutes of waiting, it turned out they never actually made the drink.  I cancelled and got my money back.  But what a shame given how different the experience is only a few blocks away.  Same brand / business and totally inconsistent customer experience.  Not that they care (clearly) but I won't be back."

Some just seem like its their first day making a coffee. One thing they really have to work on is their staffing. Somedays its busy in the morning and they have 3 people on. Some days its slow and they have 5 people on. Yesterday at 10am there were 3 people on , a long line and one employee spent so long making a box of coffee, it was a long, long wait. Maybe they should figure out a better system for the box of coffee and the amount of sides you get with it. Maybe have the sides ready.UPDATE!!!!!Went there sunday morning before work and would probably not go back. There was a short line and it took a long time. One employee, with a reddish beard was yelling at other employees and customers because he was having a hard time making and giving out bagels. The 3 others working there had to help him and ignore the customers. He even went up to the manager and yelled at her tell her ""your the manager, you should do better"". I would have fired him then. I finally ordered my coffee and asked the barrister to add something to it at the end and was then lectured how I should have ordered it before.

There was a crowd, but I guess most of the people were taking their coffee to go because my fiancé & I found seats very easily at the stools near the large front windows. The baristas were smiling & friendly, serving the customers easily.The only problem area is the order line. It's right up against the entrance door, & it causes some congestion & a little confusion (""Are you the end of the line? Oh, you ordered already?""). But other than that, I'm pleased we found this Starbucks. Because we were so comfortable, we ended up staying a little longer than planned. Who can resist people-watching & attempting the crossword over a couple of lattes?"

But the joke was on me because after five / seven minutes of waiting, it turned out they never actually made the drink.  I cancelled and got my money back.  But what a shame given how different the experience is only a few blocks away.  Same brand / business and totally inconsistent customer experience.  Not that they care (clearly) but I won't be back."

So much so that my girlfriends are sharing the Nutella croissant as I write this review and are ""ooh'ing"" and ""aah'ing"". The Latin woman who works here is super friendly and ready to offer suggestions and the young man behind the bar is efficient and friendly. The ambiance is also great! HIGHLY recommend!!"

138,MQ8_4UUorcEm0fkO_Kbiyg,3/4/2023,1 star rating,Customer service is absolutely horrible. The barista guy had no idea what he was doing. He was argumentative and dismissive. He is said the owners friend and there will be no consequences to him.
139,MQ8_4UUorcEm0fkO_Kbiyg,10/5/2022,1 star rating,"I don't come here often, maybe 3 times now in the last 2 years but I have to say today's experience was mediocre. There were three people working, one for the register, one was the barista and last the chef. The person in front of me ordered avocado toast and so did the one behind me. I ordered a iced pumpkin spice latte... The person ahead of me and behind me got their orders before me. I think in total I waited around 15 minutes for a latte. Also to add insult to injury, the person who originally took my order stepped out from behind the register to go converse with one of the patrons (was doing this the entire duration of my wait) and the barista who had not yet made my beverage was made to take orders. So then another order was taken before my drink had even began and at this point the people behind me had also already had their beverage orders filled. Overall, not getting my coffee in a relatively quick fashion is not the end of the world, however, watching things happen in a very disorderly manner is infuriating. The order of getting orders filled should go like this to those who don't know: Person who placed first order, person who placed second order, person who placed third order.Décor: Nice and cozyStaff: If your job description is to help your employees and take orders, you should probably do that instead of going to converse and leaving your barista needing to pick up your slack."

I got a oat latte which was fine--they use planet oat milk which is super watery. Coffee shops in my experience always use oatly or the barista blend oat milk from califia which makes for the creamiest lattes. My friend got a blueberry muffin which she loved.

Although a bit of walk from where I live, it was so worth it! The inside is quite large, plenty of seating (for right now a few tables, but very spaced apart). They do take temperatures if you are dining in. This place seems like a great place if you have some work to do or maybe even a first date spot!Greek owned, the Freddos are a big part of the menu.

The place is pretty small and could probably only fill three small parties of three. My party ordered the sesame coconut cake and mango juice with sago. I've never tasted charcoal before but just by pure imagination I think this is what the sesame coconut cake tasted like ! Girly I can't taste the coconut in this cake and the black sesame paste in this was not grounded enough. Please take her away from me !The mango juice with sago was alright. I thought the mango purée in this was passable but there was barely any sago. For a $7 dessert I really expected more. I'm so disappointed in this place. I used to love Mango Mango but I just don't know what happened here.

Sadly, the peach lychee cake was sold out ): so we ended up ordering:Black sesame coconut cake ($8.25)Mango Juice w. Sago and lychee jelly ($7.75)The mango juice sago was really refreshing and the lychee jelly was a really nice addition. I think next time I'll want to try something with more coconut milk! The black sesame coconut cake.... It straight up tasted like charcoal. It was so disappointing ): the black sesame cream had a gritty texture and was not sweet at all. The cake was very dry and hard. The coconut cream between the layers did not help at all. You could hardly taste that it's coconut too!"

It's only around 250 calories and with all the fruit, it feels pretty healthy.The scoop of mango ice cream in the center is some of the best fruit flavored ice cream I've had. The creamy texture somehow doesn't overpower the vibrant mango flavor, making even the ice cream feel like a light version of ice creamIt is expensive ($12) for what is essentially a bowl of cut fruit and scoop of ice cream, but nonetheless delicious and makes you feel good about yourself while still satisfying those post-dinner dessert cravings!"

Our party of 5 had just stuffed our faces for brunch, but we HAD to have our sugar fix, so we dropped into Mango Mango. We decided to share Combo B. To be honest, I didn't find any of it spectacular, but it also was not bad. The pancakes were fluffy and creamy and the dessert bowls were chewy. The pomelo was kind of sour, and the tapioca was a bit tough. I definitely don't think I could finish a whole bowl on my own! The inside of the establishment was super tiny, and there was only one staff member visible. So if you stop by, you may have to get your dessert to-go."

I wouldn't be surprised if it had sat under a heating lamp from an old order.  My wife's Copinette Omelette was also dry and overcooked.  The place seems to do decently well, even through COVID, so perhaps we had a bad kitchen.  But don't know why we'd ever revisit this place with other options around"

In terms of COVID safety, the outdoor dining allows for a lot of ventilation, which is great, but is also right next to a bike lane -- so be careful as you step out because I saw a few people nearly get hit! As with all large groups, it took a bit for the entire group to arrive; however, the staff didn't rush us at all and instead gave us complimentary mini croissants as we waited. T.T So amazing!! My friends loved the croissants and quickly ate them up.I ordered a french toast, which came with plenty of cream and huge chunks of apple. The toast was crisp on the outside but fluffy on the inside and had plenty of syrup to keep the entire dish sweet. They also give a ton of syrup on the side in case the prepoured syrup doesn't hit your sweet spot. The apples and cream provide a great contrast to the sweet, fluffy french toast.Overall, a great meal and a decent price for NYC brunch! Drinks were $9 per drink if I recall correctly, which is also a pretty good price."

Lots of outdoor seating, but the section in the road is a little precarious, especially if you're facing downhill, because you're sandwiched between cars zooming uphill (including massive trucks who look like they're going a little too quickly) and cyclists, who at least slow down a little because of the natural incline. It's kind of like sitting on a very slow-moving roller coaster as you're eating a meal, which, I don't know, might be your thing. 2. Free house bread! I miss places that do this. 3. Ordered the branzino, which came out nicely cooked and seared. Came on a bed of wilted spinach, tomatoes, capers, and mashed potatoes, which, as always, was my favorite part of the dish. A solid lunch spot. The menu is quite varied (salads, sandwiches, burgers, entrees) so good for anyone trying to pin down a ton of food preferences or dietary restrictions. Food came out quickly and piping hot."

Did outdoor seating and we had a tent on the street (""patio"").

The food overall was fabulous, and everyone seemed to love their dishes! Drinks took a while to come, and they were expensive and not very strong which was a bit of a miss. If you are in not much of a hurry, the experience would be fine! My husband I got these two dishes and shared:1. Pistachio Dijon Crusted Rack of Lamb - parsnip puree, roasted cipollini, haricots vert, lamb jus2. Steak Frites - NY strip, peppercorn sauce, sea salt french fries with mesclun greensI would say I was impressed with the crusted rack of lamb, but the steak frites was good, but nothing to write home about. Other people in our group god the Fettuccine Bolognese, the Grilled Branzino, the Lobster Risotto, and a special which was half lobster, and half other seafood (shrimp, oysters, scallops), and everyone seemed to love their dishes, no complaints!

I will say that I think this place is overpriced, especially looking at average salaries on Glassdoor for the NYC area, it looks like they pay minimum wage. If they were paying their workers a livable salary the prices would make sense, but that doesn't seem like the case. May be more of a special treat to me than a mid-work lunch."

HOWEVER, when things go wrong... they REALLY go wrong at this location.I've bitten into rock-solid chunks of za'tar breadcrumbs and massively undercooked wild rice, multiple days in a row of the same missing ingredient, added ingredients when specifically asking not to include them... and just today, more than a few whole peppercorns! I think someone must have been re-filling a pepper mill and dropped a bunch of peppercorns into my bowl... how nice!These are only a few examples - there are definitely more that I can't recall.I will say that the staff have always been kind to me (especially with longer wait times at the pickup shelves at peak lunch hour), and I usually write feedback in the app to let sweetgreen know when something has gone awry. They always quickly follow up via email and apologize. However... there's only so many times I can deal with weird issues like the ones I and many others have experienced. 75th + Amsterdam is pretty consistently bad.It's a shame because I really do love sweetgreen's salads - just NOT this location.

Maybe it's always like this but the line was out the door the whole time we were there! It does move very quickly when you get to the front though. It's like a chipotle but for healthy salads.Unfortunately we didn't have the best experience. My mom wanted the custom salad for 7.35 which includes a base and 4 sides. However, the options included in this are not listed anywhere. Some things are premium and cost extra but not all of those are listed so it's confusing to know what you can and can't get with the custom bowl. The premium things include chicken for $3, cheese costs 1.25, as does avocado. Service left something to be desired too.I went with the pre-designed ""don't kale my beet salad,"" which included chicken, rice, beets, kale, and goat cheese. It was very good except for the fact that some of my rice was uncooked and I had to spit it out as it was inedible.I really wanted to like this place but paying over $10 for a salad should deliver something great instead of a basic salad I could get at whole foods. I also didn't like that the beets were raw and in big chunks so very crunchy...could have been grated instead."

I managed to go when it was pretty empty, so the person behind the counter was able to make recommendations and tell me how the place worked. The food was pretty tasty! I wish the person didn't mix it up for me, but I understand if that's just part of their presentation. I will say that I think this place is overpriced, especially looking at average salaries on Glassdoor for the NYC area, it looks like they pay minimum wage. If they were paying their workers a livable salary the prices would make sense, but that doesn't seem like the case. May be more of a special treat to me than a mid-work lunch."

I made my own warm bowl with...everything. Or mostly everything. It consisted of: quinoa, apples, beets, broccoli, cheddar, tofu, portobello, cauliflower, and spicy cashew dressing...all paired with a green jasmine iced tea.It's so delicious I could cry.

HOWEVER, when things go wrong... they REALLY go wrong at this location.I've bitten into rock-solid chunks of za'tar breadcrumbs and massively undercooked wild rice, multiple days in a row of the same missing ingredient, added ingredients when specifically asking not to include them... and just today, more than a few whole peppercorns! I think someone must have been re-filling a pepper mill and dropped a bunch of peppercorns into my bowl... how nice!These are only a few examples - there are definitely more that I can't recall.I will say that the staff have always been kind to me (especially with longer wait times at the pickup shelves at peak lunch hour), and I usually write feedback in the app to let sweetgreen know when something has gone awry. They always quickly follow up via email and apologize. However... there's only so many times I can deal with weird issues like the ones I and many others have experienced. 75th + Amsterdam is pretty consistently bad.It's a shame because I really do love sweetgreen's salads - just NOT this location.

The counter has always been clean. In this time of COVID I have never seen a single staff member wearing their mask incorrectly. A couple times they have forgotten to put bread in...no biggy; and one time they ran out of blackened chicken...sad, but to go back to my first paragraph, it was at closing, so whatever.

They didn't even call to ask for the replacement. When I called, this woman put me on hold to say "" I'm sorry we messed up your order, but if you put in another order of chicken, we can add more chicken."" HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?! Then she has the audacity to say we don't want to lose you as a customer so we can add your name so we can add the chicken next time. This restaurant must think their customers are stupid.

What I received was a buttermilk waffle with a splash of cherry sauce on the corner of 2 pieces of my waffle. My son enjoyed his oreo waffle. My dads buttermilk waffle was good but cold. When I order waffles I think they should come out hot like right out of the waffle iron. I feel like the recipes could be tweaked better such as cherry waffle should have baked in cherries or at minimum a fresh cooked sauce on top not a store bought type syrup, the tropical waffle should be just that..tropical either baked in or something so the items are flavorful.

A lot of people were getting their food so I assumed I would be in an out. I waited for 45 minutes for my food still to go in and not receive anything. I literally watch people sit down and eat and leave the store and received no food. This place is the absolute worst. Even after I waited the 45 minutes I came back in to be told that my food would take 10 more minutes and they couldn't tell me what was taking 10 more minutes?

Solid baguette. Nice and crisp and soft in the inside.Traditional Banh Mi - Didn't taste traditional to me, but I ordered this because I do love a banh mi with pate. I prefer the traditonal ones from Houston, Texas. Houston has great Vietnamese food, since that city ranks top 5 Vietnamese population.Short Rib Vermicelli - I thought this was great as well.Bubble Tea - got the Thai version and thought they cooked the bubbles well.Beef Pho - found the broth to be flavourful!I am a fan of this place for Vietnamese food."

I've probably gotten food from all their locations to help out during these tougher times . Bahnmi sandwiches are some of my favorite foods to eat period so I kinda know quality when I taste it . Bahnmigos isn't my favorite for these sandwiches but they are good for the most part . However the last few times have been major let downs . I'm sad to say I am unlikely to keep supporting this business . The food quality  has seemingly declined particularly from the Brooklyn locations .  I ordered two sandwiches via Uber eats . A chicken Bahnmi and my favorite atleast when it's executed well , the beef short rib . The chicken was good . Fresh bread , fresh veggies and the chicken albeit a tiny bit chewy was eventually polished off nicely! The problem I had was with their beef short rib . All the pieces of meat was disgustingly covered by thick gelatinous fatty inedible just flat out nastiness! . U fortunately my camera isn't working because I really want to make it crystal clear to anyone reading this . At over ten bucks for a sandwich , you'd expect to find one piece of meat you don't have to end up spitting out .Not here you won't . It's so unfortunate ,because I am now forever turned off by this place . I wanted to give my support ,but a business that repeatedly serves up food like this ( their other Bk location was slightly better ) doesn't deserve my support .  I'll be on the prowl now for another restaurant that serves up beef short rib as it's one of my favorite foods ."

A quick lunch stop or delivery destination that's stolen my taste buds. Their traditional banh mi is made with Vietnamese ham and paté and it's delicious. It comes with a nice crisp bread that doesn't scratch the mouth and it's loaded with pickles carrots and Daikon that really adds the right amount of acid to each bite.Their spring rolls are a little heavy on the noodles but the duck and the shrimp options comes with a good amount of protein and enough peanut sauce to quadruple dip both rolls. The Thai ice tea is pretty standard.They only have four seats in the place and it's not the best atmosphere, but the food speaks for itself. I'll probably make this my premier spot when I want a quick grub hub meal."

My friend never had banhmi before, and he's very picky. He absolutely loved it and is looking forward to getting food from here again. I've had banhmi before, and this was just as tasty and fresh as it usually is. Great meal for those who are trying to be healthy. Also, it's a very affordable meal especially for being in Park Slope.

The baguette was a bit too soft and not crispy enough around the edges - you know you're biting into a good banh mi when half of your upper palate is scraped off.The second time I came, I got the lemongrass pork to go. The meat was good but the broth was meh. I was also expecting it to be larger - it was about 2/3rds the size of any other pho I've ever had./I think for Park Slope this is a fine place to come for the price point and if you're in a rush, but it is definitely not the finest Vietnamese cuisine I've ever had."

Totally recommend if you're in the area and looking to get your fix. The spicy isn't that spicy, so if you want extra spice add some sriracha. I've only had the Traditional that comes with a good smear of pate, pork, and Vietnamese ham. So good and so flavorful. Get extra meat, trust me you'll thank me later. Prices are a bit steep but it makes sense given the area.Boyfriend had the short rib and felt it was a bit under seasoned but still enjoyable overall. He ate some of my sandwich and said mine was definitely superior and ended up eating a quarter of mine. Next time in the area I know I can count on this spot for a good banh mi."

On this stop I had the chicken pot pie which was pretty lacking in the flavor department , leaving me unsatisfied with my bland dinner. The cocktails were on point. The fried calamari appetizer was also really nice. We were seated 20 mins after our reservation time which was frustrating especially since there were so many empty tables. Apparently they did not have enough servers to cover additional tables."

219,lmcVbZaSfTtGdjRN5ejZiw,3/14/2023,4 star rating,Brickhouse-esque American restaurant with healthy food portions but slightly expensive price tags. The Mac and Cheese + NY strip were a solid 1-2. Roughly $25 a dish. 3.5/5 stars as a lunch spot.
220,lmcVbZaSfTtGdjRN5ejZiw,12/12/2021,4 star rating,"Check out my in-depth review on Insta @dlireviews! :)Secured a reservation here with a friend since I was visiting town and this place is notably a staple for visitors. Needed to check out the buzz here!The interior is quite spacious, clean, and has a mellow feel in lighting and ambiance. After getting seated, I ordered the Smith Eggs Benedict and Roasted Tomato Soup. I took a bit to get our orders in, but I attribute that to how busy they were.The Smith Eggs Benedict was delicious! I liked the seasoning on the side fries (could've been a bit hotter), and the eggs Benedict themselves were well seasoned and went down as a light eat. I would've liked the eggs a bit runnier and the biscuit smaller (it was quite thick), but I was still able to eat all of it and felt satisfied overall. At $22, it is a hefty price...but I guess this a place to go to when you have an occasion. The roasted tomato soup was also flavorful but kinda heavy - too much melted cheese, and the soup itself could've been more runny. Did not get to finish all of this one.Still a stop worth visiting particularly for brunch in my opinion! On the pricier side, but worth trying.PROS:- spacious interior with indoor and outdoor seating- staff are very friendly and attentive- eggs Benedict had tasty flavor profile that wasn't too heavy either - plentiful brunch style options on the menu to tryCONS:- on the pricier side - consistency of both eggs and soup could've been runnier"

Most workers are friendly and welcoming. the male worker there is rude and has made multiple mistakes with orders placed. after being confronted or corrected about his error, he laughs it off and will say he charged you what you got... even if that wasn't what you ordered in the first place. happen to me twice and I witnessed it to someone else.

This location is typically easy to get a table at and has an upscale vibe. The service is good and the menu is representative of a typical Persian restaurant. They also offer free delivery in the neighborhood, so be sure to order directly from them if you're looking for food at home. When you sit down they bring delicious warm bread to the table with a yogurt dip and some kind of salsa (that isn't a traditional Persian sauce). I am impressed by the spread as a lot of other places serve a more simple flatbread. My go to order is a beef koobideh with rice. You're also able to upgrade the rice to a specialty variation for $3 or replace it with for grilled vegetables for free, which is a great option if you're low carb or looking for a healthy alternative. The vegetables are a mix of grilled zucchini, bell pepper, and a bunch of other things. I also always recommend to try tahdig topped with stew as an app when you're at a persian restaurant!"

Not sure if they are taking reservations, but a walk-in was getting us a table at 6:30 pm without any wait.We wanted to sit on the street side Cabana seating that they have installed, which looked very inviting. Had to wait for that seating though, for a good 30 mins in scorching heat!Once seated, we were served some nice ice cold water and got started with some appetizers which included Dolmeh ($8), Hummus ($9), Babaganoosh ($9.50), Sambuseh ($8), and Traditional Kashk-Bademjan ($9.5). Portion sizes were decent, and apps were packed with flavor. The traditional Kashk-Bademjan was a winner and tasted amazing with their excellent freshly made bread.For main course I got the Mediterranean Chopped Salad ($10), and the rest of my party ordered Chicken Shish Kabob ($20), and Chicken Sultani Kabob ($26). Our ordered was messed up and we were served and charged for Chicken Strip ($19) instead of the Sultani Kabob. The restaurant slowed down in service significantly towards the later part of the evening, and we had no intention on correcting our order.Service however was excellent at the beginning and the food is absolutely delicious!

Since it was more of a spontaneous decision and we hadn't planned on eating out, we were all dressed very casually in jeans and t-shirts... to which the waitstaff looked us up and down disapprovingly. Yes, it's a nice restaurant but not ""upscale"" by any means.Our waitress was a bit clumsy, spilling water when filling our glasses. She also gave us an attitude for not ordering alcoholic beverages? I'm aware that's how many servers get the bulk of their tips, but calm down and stop being so pushy about it.The seared scallops were perfectly buttery, served over a delicious black risotto. The ""garlic chips"" were a bit unnecessary, though. I'm sure they were added for texture, but instead gives a burnt flavor and unpleasant stickiness to your teeth.And of course they were trying to rush us out with a too-early check by the end - it wasn't even busy, nor were they closing soon. I would not recommend based on customer service alone."

Unfortunately for us, the restaurant was no longer offering the display due to health and sanitary concerns in correlation with the recent COVID-19 food policies. She was still able to order the dish, nevertheless.While the food was delicious, our dining experience there was not the best. Our dining experience and expectations with Marco Polo were not tarnished by their inability to use the parmigiana wheel, but because of their staffs lack of regard for retaining professionalism while on the job! Our dinner was disrupted by an argument between staff members that included the exchange of vulgar language and slurs. Regardless whether we were the only two patrons dining at this seemingly ""fine"" establishment, this is not the proper way for employees to act while on the job! While our young server apologized profusely for the actions of his associates, any concerns between staff members should have been taken away from the dining areas, or taken directly with the manager in an orderly and professional matter. Unfortunately, their tones and word choices interrupted our lovely evening and lowered our appetites and appeal for the resturant and our meals."

The valet never came out, so I brought my keys inside and gave them to the hostess who said she would get the valet to park my car. They seated us near the window where I could see my car.  I haven't been to this restaurant since before the pandemic. Years ago, we were regulars when the menu was more Venetian not so much a red sauce restaurant. We shared a beat salad, which was very good. We both ordered fish. The The trout on Daniels very good, but my friend said her sole Francesca didn't taste fresh and was a little slimy.   I tried to get a waiters attention, but they seemed all to be very busy with the regulars at the bar, and no cane by.  Trying to salvage dinner for my visiting friend. I had to get up and ask someone for a dessert menu. When the dessert menu finally came, I couldn't get anyone's attention to order dessert. Since attention was lacking, we decided to go home and have dessert at home. My car was still sitting in the valet space and I thought we can exit quickly since I didn't have to wait for my car. I went to the hostess for my keys and she said she was going to get the valet for me. I told her my car never left. The valet stand that he never came out and the two hours that we have been sitting there.  She said, nonetheless, he had my keys. We think she made him up because we never saw him. It took 20 minutes for her to find the keys and we could finally get on our way.  I think if you're a regular here, you might get much better attention and have a better dinner.

This restaurant is well air conditioned and just a peach to be inside with the heat.I sit at the bar waiting for my friend, and Antonio as gracious as he is, asks me if I would like I drink. Very knowledgeable, very personable, and very, very kind. He has the kind of attitude that just exudes excellence in everything he does. Speaking of Antonio, he also had a great nose for wine pairings, so if you're in for the full experience, this man will have you taken care of. The whole place is very clean, and I watched Antonio give personal lessons about how waiters/waitresses should setup and handle a table, which I took great admiration to.I ordered a half dozen blue point oysters, which, my goodness, were perfect. and the associated accoutrement were just....beyond delicious. I believe it was, pickled red onion, a cocktail sauce, and a mild aioli. all fantastic enhancers of the dish. I also ordered the stuffed zucchini flowers, which were just out of this world delicious. The amount of care that went into flavoring those to leave me wanting more after every bite, perfecto.My friend ordered the rack of lamb, which for lack of his perspective, was devoured.Myself, I ordered a special of veal over polenta. I never order veal, I would say I was almost egged on to order it from an outside influence, but, man, the way this was slow braised, and just given so much care....I cannot speak highly enough about it.Overall, the restaurant showed a lot of care in the nuances, i.e. cleanliness, waiter manners, timeliness of responding to our table, and also, our table cloth was cleaned between courses, which I have the utmost respect for.The neighborhood the restaurant is in is super friendly, and I have nothing but positive things to say about my experience.

Our crime of carelessness was quickly punished by this restaurant's food quality.I know that I'm totally looking a gift horse in the mouth with this one, but the complimentary bread was not fresh or even Italian for that matter. Stale, presliced loaf you'd find in any grocery store. And what's with the bottle of olive oil that was placed next to it?!  I'm talking a plain grocery store bottle with a generic label still on it that you would find in your own kitchen. The veal meatballs were by far the best part of the meal, but by no means were they great - dry and bland, but totally edible once I added some salt and red pepper to these. My request for salt and red pepper was greeted with raised eyebrows and utter confusion. Now I take pride in not being a picky eater, but as I took a bite of the scallop from the scallop and black rice risotto entree, I had to spit it out (apologies for painting that image in your mind) - rubbery, super fishy (which of course means they were not fresh), and the amount of salt was off the charts. As for the black rice risotto - also super salty, tough and strategically spread out very thinly on a large plate to give the meal an appearance of a larger meal than it actually was. The only good thing to say about this dish is that it was quickly taken away from our table and removed from our bill upon expressing our dissatisfaction.We paid out $65 dollar bill having consumed nothing but two drinks and two meatballs each and ran out of the place hungry. Absolutely terrible. There are much better Italian spots in this neighborhood."

I've never been to the south, but I guess this is supposed to emulate the aura of a southern bar with its sorta bare and gritty decor, and dim yet neon lighting. This bar felt like the cowboy pit stop bar station of the New York City ""world is in your palm"" Park. Except that it's spankin' new with none of the ""character"" that comes with age for bars like these - as I would imagine. I have nothing against that, but it was just maybe slightly awkward for me to be in a neighborhood bar, where I felt like they had some Confederate flags stashed behind the bar. Also, bartender found a NYC lipstick left behind. If you're unfamiliar with the barbarity of the situation: if you're a chick, you need to reevaluate your choices. If you're a guy with a chick who wears NYC makeup, you need to leave that quickly. It is, otherwise, chilly chill. And if you're into a contrived setting for your contrived persona (and why wouldn't you be, this is Williamsburg), this is your bar."

Eventually the place got super crowded both inside and out, and it was a little hard getting to the bar for more drinks. However the back area is nice with different levels of the deck. The few times we went inside for drinks the music was playing, which you couldn't hear at all outside.My main complaint is that it was SUPER smoky outside. The bathrooms were also hard to get to because of how many people were standing outside the doors.All in all though it is a solid bar that I would return to because of the outdoor seating."

It was nice to see a diverse crowd, enjoying the laid back country vibe coming from the speakers. I ran into some old friends which was nice, and a rather large birthday party came in, but didn't seem to take over the bar (which I feel happens a lot in bars.) This place seems to have a good selection of beers, good prices, an awesome juke box... back yard, friendly... cool movie nights, Dj's on saturdays... what more could you ask for?  AAAANNNNDDD, the bartender was a total sweetheart, even though I bothered her with having to make red wine spritzers for me all afternoon -- most bartenders roll their eyes and just hand me a budweiser."

Patacon has been on the list of local spots for awhile, but their plantain burger seemed to fit the hunger (Yelp) profile for the day.Added a side of avocado and a side of fries for good measure. Happy belated National Burger Day everyone (May 28).Also tried the Pabellon and that was a nice sandwich with more impactful Southern American flavors with the beans and marinated beef.Service took a little while with the phone and Seamless orders pouring in. I would recommend small customizations to each Patacon sandwich as the plantain buns add dryness and crispness to all the variations. Next time I want to try the Paisa or Buenos Dias."

Maybe I placed an order on an off day. I order and Arepa Reina and a side order of Yucca with Chorizo and Queso. My Arepa tasted like it was cooked using old oil and the Chicken Salad definately could've used more seasoning. My Yucca was mad hard but the chorizo on top was pretty tasty. I was only able to eat half of my food and just tossed the rest (which I rarely ever waste food even if I don't care for it.) Overall, I'm glad this wasn't my first expierence eating an Arepa.

284,mpsrOj-UZH-yqrwRxzk0mg,4/6/2022,5 star rating,Delicious quick service Chinese spot. The restaurant has a fun vibe and was pretty busy for a Sunday night. I got the stir fried chicken with chili paste and I opted to not have the chili paste but spicy warning: even the mild is pretty hot! It was really delicious and filling and I would definitely recommend for a quick and easy dinner.
285,mpsrOj-UZH-yqrwRxzk0mg,4/3/2022,5 star rating,"When I took my first bite I told my partner, ""it's a good thing we don't live next to here."" Because as someone perpetually trying to eat healthier and watch their weight, this would've been too big of a temptation. (Then we discovered that there's another location closer to where we lived, but far enough that we'd have to work to get here, but I digress.)I was first drawn to this place because of the rice noodles. I'm always on a hunt for a good rice noodle place to fulfill some feeling of nostalgia. I was not disappointed: the texture of the noodle was a+. The thing that is unique about this place to me is that it feels like legit hunan food but it's a different take on it. And there aren't so many choices that it's overwhelming, but enough variations between the bases (dry or soup noodle, rice) and the ""mix ins"" are so good and so solid that it really makes the perfect fulfilling experience. Plus it's reasonably priced, large portions, low key, easy to come with a group, and generally is the perfect fast casual replacement for, say, chipotle. But maybe a wee bit less healthy.Would recommend to anyone looking for a casual but delicious meal."

We picked up a family meal (very prophetic) for a date night in watching DVDs.  Once I chomped on the first piece of chicken, I was hooked.Perfectly seasoned, moist & flavorful, Boston's chicken is hard to beat.  Along with the large variety of side dishes, it makes a great midweek dinner when you don't want to cook.  If you're sick of chicken, you can vary it up with their meatloaf, which is quite good or the sliced turkey breast, which sometimes can be dry, if it's been sitting. Favorite side dishes: buttered corn, loaded mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, stuffing, green beans. If you like spicy sweet, you can now get dipping sauces to go with your chicken. You have a choice of Zesty BBQ, Honey Habanero or my fave, Sweet Thai Chili. Spice it up!This BM has also closed temporarily for renovations but is now back to slinging those spinning fowl with a brand new food service case and you can enjoy your meal on new tables & chairs."

The cornbread was grainy and dry also, their cilantro rice was still cold in some parts like they didn't defrost it properly. The Mac and cheese tasted worse than any dollar store brand of Mac and cheese that you can buy. All in all a horrendous waste of money since 95% of my food got thrown out. Do not buy food from here."

Menu has remained largely unchanged too. I went straight for the usual: Chicken Pot Pie w/ Side of Cornbread: The Chicken Pot Pie- Crust was less flakier and less softer. Vegetable filling(obv. the canned variety) was a tad salty and sort of lacking in the creamy, soupy, liquid-y component. However, the same taste was still there. It's probably just the different cooking/preparation times. The Cornbread tasted the same way it did when I first tried it back in 2012. Soft, crumbly, and with hidden hints of sweetness. :}How nostalgic! Not only was it super filling, but it was also under $10! Not bad for a fast comfort food chain."
297,QdmvRfJb86BVvk6A-J5gAg,2/21/2020,1 star rating,"There must be a serious management problem at this location. They seem to always be understaffed. This usually means that the dining area rarely get's cleaned. Hours could go by before someone cleans the tables, takes out the garbage or restocks their depleted stock.Furthermore, the cashier is usually doing double duty handling the cash at the register and also doing the food service. They go from touching the money, right to handling the food without either washing their hands or wearing gloves. And, if they do wear protection it's usually just on glove. Their bare hand (no glove) is grabbing plates and food items without a care in the world. It's sickening. I brought this to their attention and they immediately grabbed another glove. Once they finished and done with my order, they went right back to using either no gloves or one glove minutes later. Apparently, they do not care that their unwashed hand(s) were touching the clean plates and food items. It's amazing that they have an A Food Rating. Don't get me started with the attitude! These people must hate their work environment. They are usually in a terrible frame of mind; super dismissive and quite an unfriendly vibe all around."

I had stopped by last night to get the family turkey and some sides. The tables, for a Tuesday night, were occupied by a lot of people..which is good. I have been to another Boston Market in Queens and for some reason their chicken and turkey were mad salty. I don't know why? This Boston Market here in Fresh Meadows has never disappointed me.

All the seats were taken but I wasn't planning on staying anyway.The lady that took my order didn't greet me and she was a little off.There was no customer service given in my opinion. No one cared. They literally took my order with no smile, no warmth. Just a ""what do you want"" type thing.The food was also blah. They didn't have fully loaded mash potatoes like other locations do so I settled for the plain mash potatoes. It was soooo dry. My 3 piece dark chicken tastes as if it was just sitting there for days and the macaroni was horrid.  My food wasn't fresh whatsoever. Overall the food was cold. I don't know how when they're on burners.Something about this location is off. I wouldn't return. And I wouldn't recommend."

The corn is sweet and buttery, and the mash potatoes has a tang to it but can harden a bit if it sits out on the counter. The gravy is good not oddly brown colored but doesn't have a strong taste but it decent. The cake is not too sweet, okay but not past standard. It was pretty packed tonight so I have to say it wasn't at the cleanest state, however I don't see a lot of employees come around to wipe down the tables.

I am usually one to never hesitate to order a burger when I go out to eat, but this was the first time I had a bison burger. Compared to the normal beef burger I usually eat, it tasted quite the same taste to it. The bison burger had a harder texture, which may have just been from the way it was cooke, and a sweeter flavor.  For the price of $11, which isn't too expensive, I wouldn't recomend if you are going to look for a juicy and thick burger."

It tasted relatively similar to a regular hamburger, but was more dry and the patty was not shaped round like it normally would be. I got mine on the italian bread with tomatoes and lettuce and ate it with ketchup. It did not taste bad or all that different from a regular burger but it was quite pricey and while the portion was not small, a regular burger is juicier, has more flavor and is cheaper. All in all, for me, this was not a big disappointment but not good enough to get again."

He then states again one small fry and we again, correct him with two small fries. He walks away and doesn't close the window and starts mouthing off about us being sarcastic and saying two small fries and then says ""nigga what"". We couldn't believe our ears that he was not only talking badly about customers right in front of us but also being rude, failing to listen correctly which is a huge function of his job, and to top it off, being racist. Just what the world needs right now. I don't understand why anyone would ever feel the need to use that word. Completely inappropriate and just disgusting. The manager, Christine's response was ""take the food"". How would that ever be the correct way to handle the situation? I really still can't believe how we were treated by the staff there tonight. I can't wait to hear how Wendy's will try to correct this disgusting treatment. So embarrassing for a huge corporation to have racist employees interacting with customers.

This review is very much specific to this location insomuch as it is primality focused on lavishing praise on it's brilliant, completely revisionist take on the cities most undeniably iconic of cookies, the black and white.    Correct (to some degree) to all the haters who have pointed out the obvious fact that this version deviates from the classic in countless ways.  Duh, and who cares, it's delicious and manages to pay homage to the classic cookies precisely for the fact that it honors it in a completely original way.  In short, B&w's here get the cronut treatment, with the dense, cake-like foundation of a classic B&W getting swapped out for a decently deliciously and buttery, layered lamented crust akin to the type of the finest of French delicacies.  The classic thick, fondant style crackly black and white topping is likewise swapped out in favor of a more delicate vanilla glaze atop the white side and rich cocoa powder and dark chocolate chips baked into the black side.   I covet and treasure a classic b&w as much as any NYer (and for my money Ridgewood's great Rudy's bakery is a strong contender for best in the city in that category) but the updated version here is as great as any of those to be found, while again being brilliantly completely different from all of those.  Seinfeld famously said of the B&W, ""look to the cookie"" and the innovative version here are worthy of nothing less than a hard stare.   I can't recall if I was actually ever at any of the previous location of this establishment before checking out this branch upon hearing of its new school b&w, which I believe is still only on offer at this location.   I've seldom sampled much beyond that when here, but I can legitimately say the few other things I've tried, namely the spinach-stuffed bureks  and bec variants, have all been uniformly delicious and exhibited a similar brilliance in showcasing creative homages to classics.  Bonus points for extra quick and efficient streamlined service that really keeps the constant line moving.    Sure it's on the pricey side, but you are literally smack dab in the middle of Manhattan and getting an elevated NYC experience, so quit ya whining haters!"

I decided I wanted a bagel which they did not have so I got the second best thing which was a Jerusalem roll... Thank God it had sesames on it and they had the "" good butter"" , ... my sister loves their gluten-free sourdough bread, she bought two big loaves of that, we did ask for chai tea lattes from the barrister who said he could make it, the cashier said they don't make that so I had to go back to verify and he said ""yes I do have the things to make it"" so the cashier was a bit surprised... Anyway I should've taken note of her face because they were horrible, both me and my sister agreed no more chai tea lattes at the bread shop, lol. All in all good experience. #Week2OfNewYorkLiving"
325,vDX37nmmQ5VnrmY3n_9w8w,8/28/2022,4 star rating,Stumbled upon this bakery / coffee shop and it was really good! My group of 5 was able to sit in the spacious seating area inside and the almond chocolate croissants we had were really tasty and tasted like they were baked fresh. I would come back!
326,vDX37nmmQ5VnrmY3n_9w8w,1/22/2022,5 star rating,Happy for this addition in the neighborhood! All their burekas are good and I also like the cheese sticks. The chocolate croissant is good but nothing special can definitely find something similar in other bakeries. I absolutely love their chocolate babka and enjoyed their Brussels sprout tart! They haven't been doing tarts recently but I'm here every week! Will definitely try the black and white cookies that everyone is talking about. I went in a weekday afternoon and it was still pretty crowded! But other times when I'm walking by it's not too bad. Definitely depends on weather and if it's around a meal time.

Breads Bakery is a cozy spot with amazing pastries and a substantial outdoor seating area that's much appreciated during this time. The inside is also very spacious and doesn't feel like you're on top of other people trying to place an order. I've been twice so far and the customer service is always very friendly. And on to the food... I've had the almond chocolate croissant which was flaky, chewy and delicious. A little messy to eat but that's a good thing! And sadly I didn't snap a pic because I was too busy eating them but the black and white cookies are SO GOOD! they're almost like a flattened croissant stuffed with chocolate. It's hard to explain but they are very delicious and worth the trip to get one or several."

This place either has the best cappuccino in the city or literally the worst, no in between. I was given a cup of tepid milk, not even a hint of coffee flavor. Literally any coffee vending machine could make a better cappuccino which is saying a lot. If you want to experience the worst baristas in the tri state area i guess breads is your place. Can't believe I spent $5 each on a cup of warm milk for the family. I got like 9 kids it was a lot of money. Could've just taken them to morton williams for a glass of milk. Poor baby shmuly is still shook and he's seen a lot."

Didn't get the apartment but found this new place I've had the shrimp and sMackin Cheese and it's yummy. Tried saving them for when I got home but that didn't happen. I like the fact they brand the empanadas so you know what you're eating instead of biting into it (especially good for those who have allergies). Anyway yummy in my tummy. Try it if your in Bklyn

Always reliable, accurate, and DELICIOUS.I went and picked up shrimp empanadas and tried out the Americana empanada (VERY GOOD) the other day - I didn't make it out of the outdoor seating because I knew it would slap as always. Ate everything on their cute patio space because I couldn't wait until I got home.Shrimp empanada with a little avocado sauce and pink sauce is the BEST. The empanadas are conveniently labeled on the crust part in the corner so you can distinguish between different empanada flavors."

I've lost track of how many flavors I've tried so far but the sweet plantain and cheese one is my favorite! All their empanadas are also cooked perfectly, you can't go wrong with this spot! What I really love about them- they label the empanadas, so if you have a large batch you will be able to identify what flavor each one is. Deff check this spot out!"

We got the classic cheese, a pizza, a shrimp and a mac and cheese with Buffalo chicken empanada and decided to try a rice bowl. Everything came out piping hot. Took a sip of my mango smoothie it was very refreshing and a sip of my friends limeade, tart but yum! Our empanadas were soo good. Not oily at all, packed with favor and filling.

They require masks, have plexiglass along the counter, and allow only two customers inside at a time so they are definitely practicing safety!I got four empanadas since it was around dinner time but I think I would've been fine with three! I ordered the plain chicken, ropa vieja, pizza, and Sweet Plantain & Cheese. I think the sweet plantain and cheese was my favorite!The people working were kind and patient! The woman who was helping me talked me through what the most popular choices were and all about their rewards program, which was great- now I'm signed up!My only regret was not buying sauces but they were still delicious even without the sauce. I also got the pina colada(no alcohol) but super delicious still! Also each empanada has a letter combo stamped into it that correlated to the flavor so that you can figure out what the flavor is when you get home!"

342,9LkO0rfLfech48143FsFZA,1/26/2021,4 star rating,"First off, let it be known I think the empanadas are very, very good. They're perfect crispy, the ingredients are hot and tasty and flavorful, and they're just what I want in an empanada (which is really one of my favorite foods, as I grew up with a Mexican mother who made them homemade). So far I've gotten the Cuban and the Ground beef, and it's nice you can just order one at a time - so I plan on just coming back and having one at a time as a snack each time until I've tried them all. The empanadas come out freshly made it seems, as it can take 5-10 minutes, but the wait isn't too long or anything. Here's my reason for not giving it 5 stars: I'm not sure if they're meeting my expectations on the pandemic. I've been in there where there were quite a few people inside waiting and while they had masks, it seemed like too many people inside at once. I chose to wait outside, but they really should be moderating that themselves. Even worse, one of the staff members came from outdoors and not wearing a mask and didn't have a mask on until a good 5+ minutes until he'd come back inside. So, he walked past the customers with no mask, and then was behind the counter (at least they have a partition) for a good while no mask until he put one on. If anything, giving a 4 is generous because of the pandemic stuff - I really should knock it down to a 3 - but I hate penalizing restaurants during a really tough time, the first time I went there wasn't the no mask issue, and the empanadas are very good. Like, your food is good, but no food is good enough to put myself at higher risk than necessary for corona. Hopefully next time it's better and they take my feedback."
343,tD2l7pW7DxiyDPLlZ9URcA,12/16/2021,4 star rating,"At $3.45 for a cheese slice, it's quite pricey, even for this neighborhood and nyc in general ( $3 at Garlic and $2.75 at most others). That said though, it's a quality classic NYC style cheese slice and definitely distinguishable from the $1-2 pizza slices around the city that use cheaper sauces and cheeses. The dough is perfect in its pillowy yet crispy balance - if you're into pizza crusts, you know what I mean. The tomato sauce is more on the salty side, can barely taste the tinge of sweetness, so take note if you prefer sweeter sauces. Good amount of cheese on the slice. Would come back if I were hungry and didn't want to walk any further. I have to say though, compared to Garlic pizza on 2nd Ave or Lunettas on 20th street, this sauce lacks complexity of flavor. This all based on the classic cheese slice- not comparing the topping slices because that's definitely more variables and subject to all sorts of preferences and combinations."
344,tD2l7pW7DxiyDPLlZ9URcA,2/8/2021,5 star rating,We ordered delivery from here through DoorDash on a Sunday evening. Our food arrived quickly and was fresh and warm. I ordered the Rigatoni Alla Vodka and my hubby ordered the chicken parmigiana. Both portions were huge and were accompanied by bread. We also ordered garlic knots.The garlic knots were seasoned well but a tad chewy for my taste. I loved the vodka sauce! We each ordered a Cannoli which were delicious! The cream had an almond taste and was so good! We will definitely order from here again or dine in if available.

I know rice pudding may not sound like the most appealing or aesthetic dessert but A.) their marketing is on POINT and will leave you feeling guilt-free about eating dessert and B.) the rice pudding (especially the caramel-flavored one) is comfortingly sweet, like eating a dessert that has been made right out of your grandmother's kitchen. Eating here has completely changed my mind about rice pudding - please please give it a shot!"

BUT this stuff was delicious. They have tons of flavors which you can sample and I ended up choosing caramel. The smallest size is $10 and listed as serving 1 person but is massive! I shared with another person but 3 people could easily share. The inside had plenty of seating and fun, quirky decor.

I like it but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it and if it's being served I might either try a spoon or forgo it entirely, but rice to riches has me intrigued enough to want to come back and try some more flavors.The concept of the store is truly so unique and speciality that it's no wonder it's based in New York. Employees weren't friendly or cold. They didn't make or break the experience at all but they did give two full spoon fulls plus a half scoop PER flavor. They were VERY generous. You really get your money's worth. When you enter the store on the right and left there is a huge table to eat but it would've been nice if there were stools to sit because the only seating in the back has three little tables.My friend and I got the Oreo, tiramisu and panna cotta flavors. I would've liked if there was an ingredient list/explanation next to each rice pudding flavor in store (the way it is on the website just for clarity) but nothing a quick google search can't fix. There's so many flavors anyone and everyone will find at least one to be enticed by. I was seriously surprised by how good this stuff was. I really thought each flavor would taste the same with just a little hint of the flavor associated with it but everything was very distinct and not comparable at all. Something about the tiramisu was a little off and I can't quite place it. The coffee flavor was a little sharp and not in a good way. The panna cotta according to the website was supposed to be comparable to creme brûlée or flan and I think that was a very close comparison for sure. It was milky and a little caramely, but mostly like condensed milk. It was definitely the most refined fancy tasting. The Oreo one was straight up cookies and cream and somehow to my horror my favorite of the three. The containers are such good quality wow. I want to collect them all lol. They're really sturdy and strong and I feel like they'd be perfect for little kids or to take to work for a small lunch.  I'll definitely give this a shot one more time."

This place is very clean to sit in as well and I can't stress enough how great the flavors are.

I was told that they are quite popular. They serve rice pudding here in all different flavors. We got two flavors to try: Cheesecake and Hazelnut Chocolate. I found the hazelnut chocolate overly sweet. The cheesecake was tasty but it is not the same as a traditional cheesecake. 2 flavors for $10.75. Price was ok. The texture was smooth and not mushy. The texture is not like congee or porridge. You can taste the whole grain rice. The portion size was filling and more than enough for 2 people. There are limited seating here. They do have a few high-top counters/tables for standing.This is the first time seeing a store that only sells rice pudding. Nice business concept. Standing by the door and watching the foot traffic, I am sure they will do well."

The staple that I used to always get was the Mascapone, I hope they keep that flavor on the menu foreverrrr. The staff is very nice & super helpful.

Latin music playing made the atmosphere fun and light hearted. I ordered the Panna cotta and French toast flavors for rice pudding  and both were really yummy.Honestly, I am not the biggest fan of rice pudding in general but this place made me really enjoy eating it!However, I think for me at least it gets a little bit tiring to eat and the mushy texture made me tired of it after about 5-7 big bites.I loved the packaging of the bowl and spoon. Really interesting as it was basically a flat shovel to scoop the rice pudding into your mouth!Conclusion: I probably wouldn't go here again because I never really crave rice pudding but I definitely recommend trying at least once!"

My partner thought that I was lying when I told him where we will be staying and how close we were going to be to the city.The moment of truth. It was the day to finally check in and I was plenty surprised of how close the Chrysler Building was. Walking in, I noticed they had complimentary flavored water along with some delicious smelling cookies. The front desk receptions greeted us very happy and helped us when we needed to leave the luggage before our room was ready.The had nice breakfast and amazing staff. Room was clean at all times and smelled pretty good. I have to say that one of the front desk receptionist WOWED me. Her name is Saole (I hope I wrote her name correctly) she was amazing with my son.

I was trying to find a hotel in the Manhattan area during Christmas time and while also trying not to empty my bank account. I called the Hampton Inn and they helped me find one of their hotels that had the lowest price in an area I needed. This hotel is located near Grand Central Station right between the Rockefeller Tree and Bryant Park. It was the best location for the cheapest price. We paid $280 a night not including tax. For three nights the total was  $924. That may sound expensive to you but once you check out other hotels in this area around Christmas time you will realize that this price was a steal! The room came with a complimentary breakfast and not just one that comes with pastries. Theirs had eggs, sausage, waffles, bagels, oatmeal, cereal, and other breakfast foods. There was complimentary coffee and hot chocolate 24 hours a day and they made warm chocolate chip cookies for guests in the lobby. The room itself was small but it was clean,  modern, and had everything we needed. It had a flat screen TV, hair blow dryer, and also had a note that if we forgot anything they have complimentary toothpaste, shower caps, toothbrush and other items we might need. My favorite thing about this hotel besides location was the customer service. The girls behind the desk helped me with everything I needed! They even printed out directions for me. Alisha was the girl that we dealt with most and she was awesome. Their customer service was what will have me coming back time and time again! If anybody is considering going to New York especially during the holidays they should definitely consider Hampton Inn!"

Since it was pretty cheap, especially considering the location, I didn't expect it to be as nice as it was. The hotel is located right down the street from Grand Central, and is about a mile or so away from Times Square. So if you're looking to do touristy things, this is an OK location. It was a 25 min. drive from LaGuardia.The staff is super friendly. They quickly got us anything we needed. Check-in was easy. The rooms were always well stocked and clean. Very impressed.The room itself was kind of small, but it was really well kept and comfortable.The breakfast consisted of eggs, donuts, sausages, potatoes, french toast, waffles, cereal, yogurts, etc.etc. It was nice to have a filling FREE breakfast in the morning. Also, each morning they had a variation of hot foods, so we weren't eating the exact same thing each morning."

This Hampton Inn provides an excellent value as the rooms are comfortable, they have a decent sized fitness center (by NYC standards), complimentary breakfast that includes eggs, omelets, hash browns, cereal, yogurt, and fruit. The one drawback (if any) was that the elevators are very slow (plan to wait 5 minutes during busy times) and are pretty compact so plan to cram in with your luggage. Other than that, this Hampton Inn was great for a quick stay."
368,5L5sMG3xP-UUIuTtxMWZwQ,6/1/2019,4 star rating,"Excellent location! Being in midtown was perfect. You are few steps away from grand central station and numerous bus stops. For NY the room was roomy as we had 3 people and didn't have to climb over one another. Hotel was clean and pretty quiet. We did have 2 instances; the intercom went off at 5am one morning and again a few days later. Also the elevator went down one morning which caused a huge wait for people trying to get back upstairs. The hotel fixed the issue quickly though. Breakfast is always consistent at Hamptons. It would be nice to have the breakfast staff clean off tables quickly as there were multiple staff members that just stayed put in the kitchen without coming out to check on the dining area. Overall, great hotel and would stay here again. Tip the pillows are flat as pancakes so you may want to bring your own."
369,5L5sMG3xP-UUIuTtxMWZwQ,10/1/2021,1 star rating,"The staff at this hotel was extremely rude and dismissive to me when dealing with a booking issue. I booked through Expedia and cancelled the booking according to their policy, in time to qualify for a full refund (before the deadline for a free cancellation that I was informed of). Due to an issue on Expedia's end, the website went down and the cancellation didn't go through in time. I immediately called and due to phone line wait times Expedia staff sent the cancellation through about 15 minutes past the deadline, and said that typically exceptions are granted for these cases, but with it being a Pay Later booking the hotel had final approval. I was assured that since I followed policy on my end I would receive a refund. However, when I called the hotel, I was assured that I violated policy and that I would not receive a refund. They contradicted Expedia on every point despite assuring me the supervisor had spoken to someone at Expedia. Even though I followed every policy I was notified of when booking and cancelling, this hotel's predatory policies charged me my entire reservation cost as a ""cancellation fee"" for cancelling *before* the free cancellation deadline. I'm not a Karen and rarely complain about service but this experience was disturbing."

372,5L5sMG3xP-UUIuTtxMWZwQ,12/26/2016,4 star rating,"For the price, this was a great hotel.  The location is terrific, being just a few blocks away from Grand Central Station, and a $8/15 minute Uber from Penn Station. Rockefeller Center is about a 10 minute walk away.  It's situated on a side street, so the area is nice and quiet.  If you want to explore Manhattan, this is a great location.The staff are amazingly friendly and hospitable, not just by NY standards but by any standard.  Stays come with free breakfast which tasted good and had a decent variety.  The breakfast room gets very hectic, especially during the 9:00 hour, so come early if you can.  There's complimentary coffee (not the greatest) and tea throughout the day, and free water bottles during your stay.The rooms are small but well appointed. I'm sensitive to noise, but any of the -05 rooms should suffice.  You'll still get some hallway noise, but I didn't encounter any side-to-side noise.  This is because the -05 rooms are some of the only rooms without adjoining doors, which is a big no-no for me.My only real complain are the elevators.  This is a tall, narrow hotel with only a few rooms on each floor, so the elevator makes a lot of stops, and in the morning rush it can be impossible to get to the lobby.  As such, I suggest staying on a lower floor to ensure you can easily walk down the stairs it you can't get an elevator.  Outside of the breakfast hours, I never had trouble with the elevators, but this definitely was an annoyance."

375,tZVN5tsprJpUOF953jcg1w,10/14/2019,4 star rating,"Really great food for great prices. I do think $4 for one taco is pretty expensive, since tacos are generally small. But these tacos are packed and shockingly filling. I had one of each taco except the Burger taco which has ground beef, and they were all delicious.     I want to be clear that the tacos themselves were all above average and delicious. However, half of them were very dry, especially the chicken. There either wasn't enough sauce on some, or just needed a little extra. You can get them with guacamole on it, but I feel like adding another moist ingredient to some of these tacos would really improve them. They were really filled with a lot of meat, and I think the difference in proportion between meat and other ingredients was too large to keep the taco from being too dry."

Last night we ordered from one of our favorite restaurants Cantina Mexicana.  We both ordered the Shrimp Faijtas which were $17.95 each. As you can see from the picture, the dish include 6 med size shrimp onions and a few peppers, no rice or beans.  It did come with Three soft shells small guccomole and cheese.  However for $17.95 we at least should have received rice and beans.

The food is fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced. I absolutely love their guac because it's simple and enough for 3-4 people. I got steak tacos which I really loved, and my friends got fish tacos and beef empanadas--both liked their meals as well. The drinks are also great! We all got different flavor margaritas and enjoyed them (they don't skimp on the liquor either!) All in all, I really like this place I feel like it's a hidden gem, and I look forward to going back!"

So I told the guy if that was enough and he said no, you can get only one cup. So while my children were fighting because they didn't want different flavors ice cream, he stood there looking at them crying and being mad that they couldn't each get their own ice cream. Now I understand that this is a business they have to sell stuff .... Nevertheless, he could have said; hey, it is ok; they both can have their ice cream and you can bring the rest of the money tomorrow. However, he stood cold as tree and looked at them as they walked away upset with only one cup.

And when you do and someone calls you to notify within one minute of getting the food, refusing to rebate $40 of a $60 order is short sided. Bottom line is you can't give your business and hard earned dollars to businesses like this who don't care.

I ordered an egg whites and cheese on a biscuit with an iced latte with skim milk.What I received... A hot coffee with a whole eggs and cheese on a biscuit.  I had to have them correct my order twice, then I have to beg for condiments.

Like purple rice yogurt, after one drink, you will feel pretty full. It can be a healthy alternative to a regular meal. I love avocado or mango yogurt - diced fresh fruit, chewy jelly with creamy yogurt...I wish I live near this place so that I can try every flavor on their menu."

Now a days, it is very difficult to find someone at the front who greets and welcome everyone as if the pandemic never happened. I applaud the manager for hiring her! Every time I'm in Flushing, I have to make sure to stop by and grab a Jujube Oats Yogurt or Melon Avos Yogurt. Honestly, I've tried many flavors thus far and they're all really tasty and fresh. Make sure to consume your yogurt within 1 hour for best flavor! This place is much better than Yomie's Rice x Yogurt."

So don't be telling people because there's only like 10 tables and I'm not trying to wait  came in one random day middle of the week, and now this is my boyfriends and I spot for some good easy and affordable food. We usually come on our off days which are in the middle of the week, and sometimes it's packed and other times pretty slow so grabbing a table isn't too much of an issue.

Maybe it's not great for some other things? Every time I've come in, it's been a super quick turnaround on food, all delicious, and I appreciate that they have the various sweeteners out so I can adjust to taste rather than trying to describe to someone behind the counter how sweet I want my iced tea to be.Seconding what somebody below said about their sweet potato fries -- I usually hate sweet potato fries but theirs really hit the spot somehow. They're even better if you have any chipotle mayo around."

Also saw one of the waiter basically scolded one of the customers by accussing her of having the intention to sit there for a long time using her laptop when the customer was just simply asking whether her table had an outlet. I waited for a long time for my food to be served or even to be offered water or anything. Might not come back, especially if I plan to dine in. Horrible service."

But, I had already eaten and it was quiet ( no lines or anything).The energy was positive and serene and to me, that spoke volumes.Let me add that everything looked and smelled delicious as I enjoyed my tea.It was suggested that their brunches are really good---and I'm going to find out for myself soon.I just thought this little, sweet cafe was just what I needed today--so thank you for allowing me to enjoy my pitstop."

After a couple of years, I came back the other day for an oat latte. I paid $6.78 - naturally (eye roll) but was disappointed. They use oat planet, a not so very good and not so expensive oat milk so right off the bat I know my coffee won't be good. If you're going to charge that much money at least use the better brand. Oatly I would suggest. I go to other coffee shops and they charge the same amount. Better coffee, better milk, better over all. #justsaying."

438,-71z5kAJS79mfmgR-DyjiQ,12/8/2019,1 star rating,"This Panera Bread location is extremely convenient for me and my girlfriend, as it is located near my school.  As such, I have dined here on a number of occasions merely out of convenience. While everything related to this establishment is generally mediocre, this past visit was horrendous. The staff is consistently rude and unhelpful (so I generally use the electronic kiosks, of which one is always broken/out of service. The food preparers nearly always miss an item, to the extent that if I amtaking out food, It must be thoroughly checked before leaving.  When you ask for the missing item, the response is either ""sorry we were out of that"" or they just say ""here!""This location has a convenient upstairs area with an abundance of tables and seating. Yet, the tables and cushions are ALWAYS dirty. Further, if you thought you could sit down and eat your food AND ALSO speak to someone or read something, think again--The music is blasting!  Lastly, the floor is just so dirty, it's nauseating to look at. Now let's get to the food. I don't expect much from food that comes out of plastic bags, but at least get the ingredients right. I ordered the steak and arugula half sandwich (picture attached). The bread was soggy, the ingredients were not neatly packed into the sandwich, the steak was not edible (mostly tough pieces with cartilage or some other inedible part of the steak), and they didn't even use arugula-- not living up to the sandwich's eponymous name! There are so many other places to eat around here that it's truly not worth the money to step into this establishment. Did I mention that half the people are not even eating Panera in there!"

When it arrived I had a caesar salad with no chicken and a cup of mac and cheese after waiting an hour 1/2 for the delivery. When I called the location I spoke with Diamond. She was completely rude, didn't ask for my name or order so she could see who put the order together and then told me I would need to come into the store to get a refund since they don't do them over the phone. If she's the manager she should be fired. I hope the location owner sees this because judging by a lot of the other reviews, this location needs some serious overhaul."

Either it's a too long of a wait despite ordering ahead, food missing from my order or giving me the wrong food. This is the last time I will order from Panera. Last week I ordered my usual salad, the Fuji apple chicken. I do make substitutions and have add ons that cost extra. In total my salad comes up to about $12. I go back to work to eat it and the bowl is half full and none of my add ons (which I paid extra for) are in the salad. I paid 12 bucks for a bowl of spinach greens.I tried to call and email customer service and as expected I did not get a response. So frustrating and disappointing, I will not return to this location.

Today annoyed me enough to write a review.I ordered on the app (which is amazing by the way) at 1.11 and it said it would be ready at 1.21- great. I get there at 1.20 almost exactly and have to wait for another nearly ten minutes. It wasn't ready until 1.28. I ordered ahead for the sole purpose of not having to wait there because I only had a short break before my next class and I still had to wait for almost ten minutes.The real kicker? I get to school and am now eating in the middle of class instead of before- and I find that there's no spoon. Not sure how I'm supposed to eat my soup now- or whoever checked this bag actually checked it. Everyone that works there always seems unpleasant and annoyed. I'm really not thrilled with this location at all."

I went in yesterday for lunch and ordered their Pick 2 special where you can choose two items from sandwiches, soups, and salads. I ordered 1/2 turkey sandwich and 1/2 Thai chicken salad that came with a side for $10. Even though the place was busy due to the lunch rush, the woman that took my order was very patient with me as I picked my items. When I got back to work, I realized they forgot the chicken on my chicken salad. After a quick phone call, the manager told me I could come back in to get my whole meal free tomorrow due to the mix up. He was very friendly and very helpful in remedying the situation. When I went in today, everyone was equally as patient and friendly as yesterday even thought the spot was even busier with the lunch rush. I'll definitely be going back to this location for lunch. You get a large amount of food for your money and the staff are friendly and attentive."

But if you want to purchase more than one order or bulk amounts, then you may want to consider a different dessert."

My favorite was the strawberry but I also liked the green tea, and the bacon potato one. It's located in a food hall with a lot of other dessert stops but def check this out for a trio of cute little donut holes"

We bought a dozen of their mini donuts that included Paris, apple cider, monkey business and lemon pop. Unfortunately they all tasted like regular donuts with the exception of the lemon one, it had a little tang but that was it. I LOVE donuts but I was so disappointed in these."
487,zBVmRHenJfKenwW9RnkbCw,9/20/2017,4 star rating,Cool doughnut place in the Plaza. They make them fresh for you and have many different unusual flavors. They put them in a take out pizza box. Prices are reasonable. Bite size which is perfect! We really likes the paris time and green tea buzz. Great to have them at a party!

I came here on a Saturday noon and the breads just came out of the oven. The breads were still warm and steaming inside their plastic cover. I got the bo lo baos with taro and custard filling and a loaf of whole wheat bread with pistachio and cranberry and the bill was about $7+. I ate the taro bao a few hours after I left the shop and saved the custard one for breakfast 2 days later. My favourite part of the bao is the top - it is crispy and crumbly. The taro bao was soft but the filling wasn't too good - it felt pasty and grainy. I baked the custard bao for 10 minutes in a 350F oven and the top crisped up again, but the bread became a little tough and the filling dry. It is probably best to eat the bread on the same day.My favourite buy is the loaf of whole wheat bread with pistachio and cranberry. It is the most expensive loaf ($4.50) among the other loaves of bread in the store, but the fruit and nuts made up for it. I kept the loaf in my freezer, toasted it 4 days later and it was still soft in the inside. Peanut butter/nutella, blueberries and banana make a great spread on top of this bread.All in all, I love this bakery for serving very fresh bread. I know that I am not buying days old bread."

My favorite type of onigiri is tuna but I felt like they butchered it here. The rice texture was weird, the tuna tasted really fishy (maybe not enough mayo) and the salt they use was off putting. It wasn't the finely granulated salt, it was bigger chunks. The seasoned kelp onigiri was really good though. Great flavors but the rice really lowered the overall experience. It wasn't sushi rice. No flavor at all. Sad to say that I'll be sticking to buying my onigiris in Manhattan."

516,kL9XCbKLaNYOix8YjL4VWw,11/29/2020,4 star rating,"The BEST value for Thai food around (and we all know Thai food in nyc is pricey by default). Lunch specials that include plenty of vegetarian options start from a very cool $7.99, and unlike every other Thai restaurant I've been to, includes a full-sized menu drink. It's legit Thai owned and operated.What we bought :2x full-sized thai iced tea - a little on the sweet side but nice.1x crispy tofu (2 piece) - good, nice crunch, wasn't dry on the inside but wasn't a fan of the sauce.1x spring roll (2 piece) - good, very plump.1x chicken pad Thai - their version was more tangy than sweet, they've used more tamarind and fish sauce (less palm sugar). Very enjoyable, on the saucier side. Portions seemed smaller than most places, but nonetheless filling, generous with the chicken.1x beef panang curry - this curry is lesser known and not every Thai restaurant serves it which is a shame. Was delicious, their version included pineapple which was interesting but I think it could have done without it. Portions were generous, it's a very heavy curry so make sure you don't eat too much beforehand.= 2x lunch specials!!!! :)There's a restroom and a decent amount of parking in the area, the restaurant is on the smaller side so not suitable for large groups, stroller-friendly. If you want a delicious, filling lunch that's easy on the wallet, come here!Happy eating and keep safe :)"

I love that it is a block away from Columbus circle (change the name and take down the statue of that colonizer NYC) and Central Park. Every single time I visit NYC I go to ABA. My favorite two things to get is the Turkish tea and the Kofta entree. The Turkish tea makes my soul do the Harlem shake when I take a sip. The Kofta is divine! The way it is seasoned encompasses so much flavor it is unreal. The hummus is a bonus that I love. It doesn't leave a weird aftertaste, it's very clean. I wish I could get it delivered to Colorado without breaking the bank. This is the MF SPOT!"

It was the first visit for two of us ~ the others in our party were returnees!. As others have written, the service here is extraordinary (thank you Koram (?) the Turkish server who has a wife from Japan and only works at ABA on Saturday nights and is very personable and efficient) and the food was well prepared and excellent tasting.Whereas I am from Brooklyn, I compare all Turkish restaurants to Taci Beyti, my hometown favorite. The food here is just as tasty - the difference being that the food at ABA is a little less seasoned than at Taci, so a little different in flavor but the cuisine at both restaurants is above average!We began with a delicious Greek salad (fantastic stuffed grape leaves) and the always delicious Turkish bread and olive oil combo. Also of mention is the feta cheese on the salad that was far less salty than at most restaurants. For main courses we selected doner kebab, iskender kebab, chicken shish kebab, ali nazik and grilled whole Branzino (sea bass).  Each dish was flavorful and plentiful.We decided to be good and not have dessert but instead ended with Turkish coffee and tea. Being a BYOB restaurant allowed us to enjoy (a lot of) wine with our meal without inflating the check!Thank you ABA for a great culinary experience!"

They have a little something for everyone and the cost is fair, around $10 pp. The buffet food is good (well-maintained with a fast turn over during breakfast and lunch) but the stations are what keep me coming in. My favorite dishes are the Hot & Spicy Pork Belly, the Bim Mi Bop (Korean Station) and the Assorted Sushi Bowl, all which are big enough for 2 meals. Like every market of this type, the grocery items are priced a bit high, but for that you can stop in Jacks. Environment is loud and upbeat, a nice pick-me up after sitting in a quite office all morning, just don't expect to have much conversation if you sit near the live band."
531,EZCOwqdPJnTBiDLuZ3IjNQ,1/24/2019,1 star rating,"Avoid this place at all costs This place is just awful. Do not waste your time or money on anything except maybe a bottle of water if your absolutely desperate. Went in for a deli sandwich, which was $17! Even for Manhattan that's a big ask when the sandwich is nothing to write home about at all. My sandwich didn't even have any pricey extras included like bacon or guac. Furthermore, the ""hot"" sandwich was lukewarm and smelled/tasted like three day old garbage. They may have a large selection, but the pre-made food has been sitting under heat lamps all day long without being replaced, and I know this because I stopped by several hours later and observed the same portions sitting in the same exact locations I had seen them in earlier. You'd think that someone in food service would freshen the food, or at least add more to half empty trays so it would look more appealing.And then, on top of it all, when I asked to use the restroom after eating, I was told that because my total was under $20, I was not permitted to use it AND that I would need to purchase $3 more of food or drink before they would let me use it. UNREAL!! Even for Manhattan. Seriously, if you go to the counter they will tell you to your face that you must make a purchase of at least $19.99 before you can use their restroom. I mean, do they have a masseuse in there or something? Are they embarrassed by the condition of their bathrooms? Or are they just trying to extort unknowing customers? I'd say it's the latter.I would up having to go to the Pret two stores over and buying a cup of coffee, so I could use the bathroom there.This place should not only be embarrassed. They should be put out of business. Avoid this eatery at all costs."
532,EZCOwqdPJnTBiDLuZ3IjNQ,3/16/2017,3 star rating,"If you can't decide on what to eat during lunch this is the place to go. There's a lot of different options, there's the hot/cold buffet, salad, sandwiches and different cooking stations. A jazz band plays near the cashiers so you can hear the music throughout the store. Not ideal when your sitting there to eat with someone since the music is SO LOUD. But it is a different touch compared to other delis. Very spacious to walk around and think of what you want to eat. Today I decided to go with Indian food. I couldn't really tell what they had displayed so I just ordered off what was on the paper menu. Little did I know there was Chicken Curry, which is what I wanted but it wasn't on the menu. I ended up with the Goat Curry instead. The sign said it came with either rice or naan. I chose the naan. It also came with two vegetable sides, cucumber tomato salad and a cooked/grilled veggie. Neither of it was Indian, but it came with the meal so I'm not complaining. When I opened my meal I was a little disappointed, the naan was NOT naan, it was two warm pita bread. I guess to them it was just bread and it was similar, but it was the kind that you can wrap a gyro in. On to the Goat Curry, it was pretty good. Spicy, flavorful, enough sauce to dip the bread. Can't expect too much I guess since this is a deli and not your traditional Indian restaurant.I would go back for the value of the food and it's not terrible."

You have your lunch buffet that goes by weight, $8.99/lb, and your various made to order grill stations. There is your usually Korean food station, Chinese, burger grill, sandwich station, as well as the brick oven pizza, Indian grill, Mediterranean grill, sushi, and etc. there is also the juice bar and even dessert station, with cakes and pastries. If you came here without knowing what you wanted, you'd probably have an even harder time deciding what to get with all these options. Clean and modern design with seating on both ends of the store and even upstairs I believe. There was also a live band playing during lunch. Food is decent, not great but not bad. Decent lunch for $10-15."

Especially since there are like 10 of these types of restaurants in the immediate area lol. We ordered 3 dishes from the lunch special and it came with bowls of rice and soup. The soup was alright; not very flavorful. The salt baked pork chops were pretty good, though I've had better elsewhere. The salt and garlic that they use to season the pork chops were really good though! Chicken and broccoli is generic and I personally would not have ordered it but I did find the broccoli to be very tasty though! Beef chow fun tasted standard.Overall, there was nothing special about this restaurant that makes it stand out from the others. To make matters worse, it's not located directly on 86th street, but on a side street, making it kind of hidden. The prices are very good though and the food is decent and filling. The staff here was also very friendly! Minus one star because they were playing the ATV channel smh...TVB FTW!!"

There is also a lunch menu where u can order small dishes of food like meats or veggies n comes with a bowl of rice if like to family style lunch where we all share with each other - also around $6-7 per dish .

The tian jia congee consisted of fish ball slices, mince meat and scallion.  It was okay.  Not much flavor as it seems like they add the toppings to plain congee.  Very big bowl for about $3.50-$4We were also going to order fried crueller, but the waiter advised us not to.  I'm glad he did as it was way too much food. We shared a table with a group of see lia (middle age women).  The dishes they ordered looked very good.  I would come back to try the dinner menu dishes."

If you're craving a hot bowl of congee when it is cold out or you simply love it like I do, Han Wong serves it well until the late afternoon hours! Don't forget to get it with the fried dough or the sugared fried dough aka ow lay so. These Asian cruellers are great to dip the congee in or to eat on their own. They are not the best cruellers I've had since they often times lack the crunch possibly because they haven't been fried for long enough or they've been sitting out for too long. The ow lay so I had today was warm, but still wasn't particularly too crunchy.Congee comes out in a blink in an eye, so if you're looking for a cheap, filling, and bone warming breakfast Han Wong isn't bad for it!"

546,EZCOwqdPJnTBiDLuZ3IjNQ,2/14/2015,3 star rating,"Locals may be confused about the Chinese name of this restaurant as Han Wong has a very similar name to the Chinese name of 86 Wong on Bay Parkway and 86th Street. Once you step inside, you will find practically all the staff from 86 Wong in Han Wong. The word is that 86 Wong has changed management and all the staff are now at Han Wong. Ok, no big deal. Don't care about the drama. I'm here for the FOOD!There are several large tables set up in Han Wong. Since it's a new establishment, the place is very clean. We will see how long that lasts since 86 Wong used to consistently get C as their health rating. We were seated with another family of four in a large table. They had just placed their order as we sat down. The waiter brought us the menu and the prices seem to be the same as 86 Wong. We wanted a congee, Chinese style steak with rice, and Chinese donut wrapped with rice noodles. The waiter then said that rice dishes are not served until 10:30AM. But it was 10:40AM already, so the waiter went to the back to check with the chef. He came back and said they were not serving rice dishes yet -- because the rice wasn't cooked yet. Alrighty. We decided then to get the soy sauce marinated chicken with rice noodle soup. The food truly came in piece by piece. The congee was ok and similar in quantity as 86 Wong. However it was over seasoned with salt. The chicken with rice noodle soup was on par with 86 Wong. There were many meaty chicken pieces and the rice noodles were smooth and not over cooked. The broth was flavorful as well. The Chinese donut wrapped with rice noodles never came. Even the family sitting at our table waited a long time for their food. The mother of that family had ordered a dumpling soup and it never came. When she asked the waiter, the waiter said it was sold out. Dumplings sold out at 10:40AM?! To make matters worse, the person up in the roasted meat section kept ringing the stupid bell multiple times every time there was an order ready. The back kitchen also rang the bell when order was ready for serving in the kitchen. So the whole time we were there, we just constantly heard bells ringing. It was quite annoying and frankly unnecessary for the roasted meat section to have to slam the bell 4 or 5 times every time. I think the guy was just doing for the heck of it. Despite 86 Wong's low health rating, I've always liked their food. However, there are still many problems Han Wong need to work out in order to have a smooth operation. I'll try to visit when they have worked out their kinks."

Located on a side street next to 86th Street, Han Wong Restaurant is a small restaurarant with approxiamtely 10-12 tables. Luckily, there were only one or two tables left and we didn't had to wait. I thought this was like any other Chinese restaurant, tasting all the same and bland with the use of similiar sauces, but wow. We ordered five dishes: Lobster w/ Ginger & Scallion, Peking Pork Chop, House Special Stir Fried Seafood, Roasted Young Pigeons, and vegetables (I forgot the name already -.-) and they were all consistently tasty and satisfying. I defintely recommend all these dishes. On top of this, service was pretty good. Our waiter refilled our drinks without us asking and also gave us new plates when they were filled.

Your pal Johnny can report that, in all the years he has been hitting this joint, he has never been roofied by anyone -- even in his less alert moments. And that's because you need to have an authentic ""fuck you"" spirit inside your soul -- something akin to an untamed bronco -- in order to have a good time here. Now your pal realizes that such a temperament is beyond the imagination of the soft-skinned hipsters who claim to be meaningful residents of New York, living jokes who would be eaten alive, running up a four-figure bill with their shrink, if an avocado toast order went wrong.

Good crisp bite to the outside bread, which contrasted well with the seasoned beef (patty?) with carrot slaw and a mix of sauces (harissa, tahini and something else).Space has a sink to wash your hands prior outside the main bathroom, which is handy.Vibe is friendly and would not be out of place at an Asian night market (haven't been to any in Egypt so can't say)."
560,T1I_RJues-XuFscUEtHowQ,6/4/2022,4 star rating,"Yelp Elite Experience: First time having Egyptian fast food. I think it's pretty good and flavorful. The portions are big and selection is large for the types of sandwiches and bowls you can order. It's recommended to try all the different types of sauces they have to offer alongside of the fries, hawawshi (sandwiches) and bowls. We got the classic hawawshi (~$10) and a falafel salad bowl ($13.50). Of no fault to the restaurant, my preference is for less heavier types of foods and a lot of the flavors and sauces are new to me (although there are healthier options with the falafels and salads). I feel like I got full pretty quickly, from the Hawawshi and it could be split between two people if necessary.I think it would be interesting to make the location reflect more of the street food environment in Cairo, given this type of cuisine is new to a lot of people.I'd come back for a quick bite if I'm in the area again."

As someone who usually only visits a restaurant once in NYC, Zooba is my regular go-to quick meal option whenever I'm in lower Manhattan.Zooba offers Egyptian street food fare. Most of their menu items are unintentionally vegan (the best kind of vegan). I keep going back to order the Spicy Hawawshi. It's essentially a thin, cracker-like pita (baladi bread), that's lined with a thin layer of beef and veggie patty and stuffed with orange carrot slaw, tahina, and harissa slaw. Every time I've ordered it, it's always so hot that I need to wrap the hawawshi around foil to take a bite. Be warned, though, it's legitimately spicy. I don't bat an eye around Szechuan plates,but this pita made my lips tingle and I had to drink water in between bites. The Spicy Tameeya Sandwich is also fantastic. It's very similar to falafel, but tameeya is made with fava beans (lower calories than chickpeas), and stuffed inside baladi bread with harissa cauliflower, salad mix, and tahina. Eat through the sandwich and you'll see a cross-section of green, orange, white, and brown."

563,T1I_RJues-XuFscUEtHowQ,4/5/2022,5 star rating,"I really enjoy this place!! It is great & have been back several times already. My favorite go to is the classic falafel or pickled lemon falafel sandwich. It is SO good. It is the perfect fill me up healthy sandwich. It is quite tasty - you might have to move the falafels a little up since they tend go to the bottom of the pita so definitely move them up ahead of time unless you want to want to mainly eat all the falafel at the end. I forgot to do this one of the times I got this and my first few bites was mostly pita. I have tried one of their bowls and it wasn't as amazing as the falafel sandwich in my opinion.This is great place to go with your vegetarians friends too. The music is cool. The interior inside is also nice. They have a good amount of seating. The outside for seating is not the cleanest, but it definitely has a cool vibe. There are lots of stickers on the outdoor seating area.This is the only zooba here in the states I believe. The rest are located where they are based in Egypt. I definitely would love to go to Egypt and try out the authentic street food, but this will do for now in the meantime."

They serve some of the best known Egyptian street food dishes here, including koshary (pasta, rice, lentils and spicy chickpeas, covered with a seasoned tomato sauce) and taameya (fluffy falafels made from fava beans).I always recommend the bowls ($13) which include protein options such as chicken, beef, meatballs, and taameya as they pack a ton of flavor and colors. I also love their sides too-- if you're a fan of hummus, bessara ($9.75) is a fantastic choice and if you're looking for comfort, you can't go wrong with the ful medames ($5.50). Honestly, I love everything on their menu!There's outdoor seating available, but it's not heated so I recommend getting your food to-go in the cold weather."

The food was OK:- Foie gras: very good, but why a single tiny skinny piece of brioche. You should at least give us one or two more slices - Tuna tartare: fresh but meh, lacking in flavor. Nothing beats Kimika's tuna tartare, IMO- Oysters: fresh but overpriced at $26 for half a dozen- Cavatelli: definitely the best appetizer, very very goodHere's the bad part:For entree we split the Berkshire pork belly. It was very good but took an unacceptably long time to come. I'm sorry, we had to ask where the food is and I believe our waiter just forgot about us... A waitress/ sommelier came over as we were just sitting there with nothing, and asked if we'd like more wine. At these price points ($300 for 2 with a shared entree) I expected the single glass of wine to be at least complimentary given that we'd waited a very long time for the food? Nope, it was not comped. This was not Michelin-level service. I also left to the bathroom and came back to see my napkin on the floor. It would've been totally fine if this was just another random restaurant but not great for this kind of establishmentWe also got 2 drinks and they were both very very sweet.

Service was on point, missing nothing. We also explored their delicious menu of Gotham chocolate bars. They had a delightful jazz trio which included a very talented vocalist to entertain, adding to the already lovely ambiance. Their sommelier was extremely knowledgeable and able to recommend a delicious dessert sherry to complement the wide variety of delectable desserts.

He had an attitude the rest of our dinner & made me feel very very uncomfortable. He basically ruined the entire dinner for my guests & I.Besides this, the food was good.

Most would close for ""renovations"" and never re-open. So I guess longevity earns a star as well?Stopped in for a simple lunch, the bone marrow burger and steak (cut not mentioned on menu, but it was a strip). Those two items were done very well. It was a quick weekday lunch and not a full meal. Will be back for sure to sit through a proper dinner. Despite trying to ""relax"" the vibe, most of the lunch dining room were suits, seemingly from out of town. I think (and I'm just a simple guy on Yelp) the right thing to do would be renaming this restaurant so Blamey could earn her own reputation versus trashing the previous regime while benefitting from the history this establishment previously deserved.

My group went the a la carte approach and ordered dishes for ourselves with a few items to share.I tried 9 items from their menu: APPETIZERS: Terrine: 3/5 -- basically a layered, cold meatloaf made of 85% ham hock (pig foot), 5% foie gras, 5%, shiitake mushroom, 5% Savoy cabbage. Came w two slices of their toasted whole wheat sourdough bread. Dish was a bit dry w the ham and the layer of cabbage was basically a small sliver of a leaf. Was a big heavy for an appetizerScallops: 5/5, this was one of my favorites!! It had just gotten added to the menu and while the portion was small, the scallops and uni were so light and delicateBeef Tartare: 5/5, included raw beef, tomato, and hazelnut. Came with these asian fried prawn crackers but slightly thinner and a bit too oily. Otherwise, this was one of my favorite appetizers. Texture was perfect and the tartare was so juicy and soft I could have mistaken it for a special sashimi.ENTREES:Lamb shoulder w a tomato sauce and some veggies on the side: 4/5, the best lamb I've ever had. Evenly cooked throughout, seared well, smooth, soft, likely sous vide. Minus one star though cause 1/5 of my lamb was a chunk of just pure fatBraised rabbit leg: I didn't try this but half my group ordered this and unanimously raved about Spaghetti Neri: squid ink pasta w octopus in a light tomato sauce. 3/5, it was mediocre. Spaghetti texture was al dente but not as chewy and dough-y as I like. Octopus was good but the dish was very standard overallDESSERTS:Their pastry chef is still the same one as before. Flavors range from dark dark dark dark chocolate to lime tart to curry to just straight up cheese.House made dark chocolate w hojicha ice cream and chocolate mousse: 4/5, dark chocolate to mousse ratio was so high that the concoction was too dry and bitter. The hojicha ice cream complemented the bitter chocolate well. If you like 99% cocoa desserts, the chocolate without the ice cream pairing will be perfect for you.Pear soufflé w yogurt ice cream: 3/5, SUPER tart and way too sweet. I loved how foamy and light the consistency was though... almost like a hybrid between a marshmallow and whipped egg whites (to stiff peaks). I wouldn't order this again for the flavor but the texture was coolHazelnut ice cream: 3/5, others at the table didn't like this. Flavor was standardAside from the very traditional interior and the lights that looked to be draped by cream colored bed sheets, Gotham was fantastic (they even have coat check!). The vibes are a bit on the more traditional, older people side, but the food reflected otherwise. Random: Sinks in the bathroom are all located in the bathroom stalls right next to the toilet. Not sure if it was for accessibility reasons since I didn't see any elevators."

The short ribs bowl consisted of kale, brown rice, crunchy onions and smokey poblano ranch sauce. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at how tender and fall-apart the short ribs were. I was not expecting this coming from a salad chain. More from a Chinese noodle soup hole-in-the-wall. Kudos to them for perfecting that.

Hard to tell #who is #who and #what is #what, because all the printouts were different. The names and the food order were in different places and in different fonts. And at the point where I noticed one bag said it was for Ira Glass, the #guy next to me grabbed that bag to see if it was for him and it was. It was Ira Glass.I think we did one of those #bro nods after that."

First time i went here a few weeks ago had to wait at least 15 mins since they were making more crispy chicken. They also forgot the bread in the salad. Second time I tried ordering online. I guess they had to wait for more chicken and just gave up, since my crispy CHICKEN poblano salad came without it. They also forgot the bread (again). I've worked in food service and this usually means the location isn't managed properly."

I'll have to admit that I was feeling pretty cranky once I was told to wait.Other than the wait, my first experience at this Just Salad was pretty decent. The short ribs bowl consisted of kale, brown rice, crunchy onions and smokey poblano ranch sauce. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at how tender and fall-apart the short ribs were. I was not expecting this coming from a salad chain. More from a Chinese noodle soup hole-in-the-wall. Kudos to them for perfecting that. The ribs were also marinated deliciously and the overall dish was pretty delectable. I came at about 5 P.M. and the venue was practically empty aside from 2 other parties. I'd say if you'd like an early dinner and would like to avoid the crowds, come at about 5-6 P.M."

It's nice to see a staff who enjoy what they do and who have a positive attitude and smile. LOW PRICE $, HIGH QUALITY, GREAT STAFF & AMPLE SEATING! I WAS an avid fan of Sweetgreen for a long time, the quality of the food and the staff have gone DOWN and has gotten very expensive. I feel the same with Chopped, especially the quality. I can't speak for other locations, but this FIT 7th avenue location is definitely my go to. I get the kale salad with chicken and a bunch of toppings. And nice size portions and much cheaper than the competitors, if you can even call them competitors. Great dressings and variety of toppings. Thank you for being my new place!! I always leave with extra to take home for later."

635,M4SNcEH7lEOqv7ts8azqAQ,3/4/2020,5 star rating,I've been to many just salad locations and never felt the need to write a review about it until Saturday. I came in at about 1:30 pm where the store was moderately busy and was blown away by the customer service I received. There were 2 employees behind the counter very energetic happy and professional. I felt comfortable in asking my server Kevin J questions about the selections that I normally don't ask in fear of becoming annoying. Ive always been a fan of byo salad with the spicy tahini dressing. Spending $14 on salad is a bit pricey but its fresh and healthy can't ask for much more now throw in excellent customer service and I'll be a fan for life. Sorry I couldn't get the female employees name due to her serving another customer but I will make a priority to do so next time. I WILL BE BACK TO THIS LOCATION KUDOS JUST SALAD

Great place for vegan and vegetarian options, as they have tofu as well as meat. Tofu was firm and well seasoned, and the rest of the items were fresh (the vegetables) or well cooked (brown rice base, mushrooms). They have a bunch of different options which sounded really tasty as well. You have the option of making your own creation or choosing a pre-made one. Prices range between 8-12$ depending on what/how much you buy. Went there when it wasnt that busy and service was fast. Workers were friendly and helpful. Nice place overall and would come back if given the chance."

I frequent here using Meal Pal and I thoroughly recommend using a food ordering service ahead of time otherwise you're gonna be out the door waiting 12 pm - 2 pm. The salads are fresh, I enjoy the toppings quite a bit and the dressings are really delicious. The spicy thai chicken salad and buffalo chicken salad are by far my favorite. I enjoy salad places that have fresh romaine and they do an excellent job of it.

Still, many, many people clearly love the place. And it is itsurely a one-of-a-kind, neighborhood institution (I live one block away), and among among the very last of its sort in Greenwich Village -- offering a nice little (happy!) bar and, admittedly, some fine looking chops. (Guess I just never ended up with one of the great ones.) Mainly, I write to say how very happy I am that they've recently reopened & appear to be thriving once again.

The chef and his offerings have actually gotten better in the past 3 years and it's great to have these folks back once again! During a period where $$$ is tight for some it was satisfying to see their classic burger right at the top of the Entrees. Beyond that there are many very creative and tasty dishes and their special custom baked deserts were to die for! Not one of us were disappointed. To top it all off, our waitress Maria could not have been better. When you don't need to look around waiting to ask for something, you know you've got a true professional serving you. We will be back again and again!!Oh, and one more thing. You'd better be vaccinated and/or recently tested or you ain't getting in. If not for that, our table of 10 would not have been there.

There is a large variety of sandwiches as well as salads and breakfast items on their menu. I have tried their Wild Child, Gunner, and Hot Mess sandwiches which are all delicious explosions of flavor in each bite. I usually only eat half of one in one sitting because they are generous portions, so it is a good idea to share a sandwich and a side of fries. I've also ordered their shrimp quesadilla which comes with rice and peas and a salad. I love their Jalisco sauce on everything! Their employees are very professional and friendly. The ambiance is also very quaint and relaxed (in the pre-Covid times when indoor dining was a thing). Five stars all the way!"

French fries are just ok, not particularly crisp or out of this worldSERVICE: no frills service, order at the counter when you're ready and they bring it out to you. EXPERIENCE: probably enough room for 10-15 people to eat, not a particularly interesting place to eat but why would you be at a deli in Washington HeightsVALUE: quite good as most sandwiches can comfortably be broken down into 2 meals or 1 stomach cramp inducing one. the sandwiches are large and most cost around $12 for the speciality ones and $8 for standard ones.SUMMARY: great deli that offers fantastic specialty sandwiches at a good value. would come back again"
654,C3cKsJ1SoYYCkM0D0K2DpA,10/28/2019,1 star rating,"Let me start off by stating this is a review for ""the experiment"" sandwich only and I opted to get it cold. First off, this sandwich is $13 so one would expect it to be big, like real big but unfortunately this was not the case.  They completely skimped on the meat portions, not to mention the rock hard day old bread. I've gotten this sandwich once before and it was really good but this time around, it was a huge disappointment.  All I tasted was stale bread that cut up my mouth with every bite.Considering minimum wage is $15 an hour(before taxes), $13 is a lot for a sandwich, especially one that doesn't live up to the hype or the price.  At best, this not-so-special sandwich would be $6-$7 at any other deli.I had high hopes for this place based on the reviews but it seems people are on a diet or have low standards when it come to the realm of sandwiches.I'd give it 2 stars just because they got the ingredients right but really, it's just 1 star based on taste, portion and price."

The cookies not so much. I also had birthday cake delivered to a friend during the pandemic and it made her day. I ordered ""for a later time"" and I think it confused the system as Caviar first brought her the wrong delivery but replaced it shortly after. I also used the Milk Bar website to order a tin of cookies for a friend who lost her parent and it brightened her day. And I also used the same website to order my sister out of state a Milk Bar sampler gift box for Mother's Day and she loved it. I didn't realize it was a mixture of perishable and non-perishable items, so she needed to be there for its arrival. It's all about the cake, pie and soft serve in my opinion. Would recommend in that order."

However, after getting this dropped off by my doordash driver (delivery & packaging was great), I realized that I've been making the correct decision of not splurging all these years. The actual sponge is great, but the frosting of the cake is absurdly heavy and sweet. Was it too hyped up to me? Maybe. Am I just not the right client base for this? Probably. But I figured if it's $55, it has to be a good cake. Albeit, I was mistaken.Would pay $15 for this on a good day."

When I first started getting these there use to be nice whole chunks of turkey in it now the turkey is chopped up finely which I do not like. They use to have more stuffing in it , you can taste the stuffing but it is not the same. The cranberry sauce is at the edges. I enjoyed when it first came out years ago. The croissant has definitely fell off. Plus the service at the Williamsburg location was not that great either. When I came there was a girl at the counter with her back turned didn't greet me or anything. I had to get her attention. I asked her assistance in my online order. She replied I don't work here. So I am wondering why is there someone who doesn't work here even at the front counter. So I got someone who worked there to help. They couldn't find my online order that I placed and paid for. So the manager saw my email receipt and gave it to me. I will try the croissant one more time next year to if it is better to see if I will buy after that. I will never place an online order with them again."

Service is decent for waiters that work non stop during lunch hours. They have plenty of Chinese dishes to order but we usually order the same eggplant and salt fish and steam carp. The steam carp takes a while to cook so if you are to try it order it once you sit down. Food is good, price is fair and service is good.

UNLIKE some other places, though, they're very Venmo-friendly! Way to live in the 21st century.I rolled up with a friend for lunch and their lunch specials are pure VALUE. I wouldn't recommend the sweet and spicy pork as it came off tasting pretty tough and inauthentic - after all it's not really a common dish back in HK - but the mapo tofu was INCREDIBLE. The shrimp with cashew nuts was more cashew nut than shrimp but it was good so I'll let it slide.The white rice they provide is very poorly moisturized so you really gotta mix it in with your dishes. Overall although this doesn't sound like a 4 star review the sheer portion volume of lunch specials alone makes this place worth coming to. The tea is great as well!"

727,wejLjvNQxkVfV4OGgMXgog,8/1/2021,3 star rating,"The staff in general are super friendly and never been treated poorly. However, when this particular Panera gets busy, it gets really slow in there. I understand its rush breakfast/lunch hour, but they need to do a bit better turning over orders better. I think its mostly because there isn't enough hands in the back, definitely not do to competency. If you're a regular Panera goer, this Panera is no different. The food is fine  and I have rarely been disappointed, but if you order a a breakfast sandwich and want a sunny side up egg thyre gonna run out a lot of the time which is a bit disappointing. If youre in the area and need a quick fix breakfast or lunch I would most probably pick that over the pizza joint and Chinese take out next door."

732,wejLjvNQxkVfV4OGgMXgog,1/7/2021,1 star rating,"We had gone in to pick up some breakfast. We used the Kiosk and ordered a sliced toasted bagel with chive and onion cream cheese with a coffee and steak sandwich. When we got our order we realized that our bagel was not only not sliced and toasted but we were missing our cream cheese. Mind you the price we paid reflected that we added to our bagel. I went to the girl behind the counter and she said ""oh there is nothing we could do because the receipt shows you only ordered the bagel"" . When I argued that we were overcharged for the bagel she ran away to the back.No manager or any other worker came out to help us. So we lost a couple of dollars and went to work. When we went to share the sandwich the meat was very sour and the sauce was not good at all. The bread was soggy. So not only was breakfast ruined but so was our lunch. The fact that not only is the food not good or fresh but we did not get the customer service that we should have received."

The service was good.  The food came out fresh and accordingly.  For some reason I feel that the portion was smaller than normally.  I fell that the Panera's  in queens (Bayside and Little Neck ) the portions are smaller and seem to be pricer than in the metro area They do have a parking lot which is very convenient."

738,qwUPVBeV6oLdiCKHQvru5w,4/11/2017,1 star rating,I walked out a few times due to several issues.1. The workers were being rude.  2. I had to wait ten minutes for them to add items to the buckets of food.  They only have a few things?  Why are they not ready?  They were joking around.3. One person there told me the manager does not want them to give big portions.  The bowl is usually a little more than half full if lucky.  For $ 10 that is not enough and doesn't fill me up.  I used to not be able to finish it but I guess those days are gone.  I assume if I get food poisoning like a lot of people did then less is better.4. The green hot sauce is always empty.  5. I complained to management but things never change. Avoid this expensive joint and bring a sandwich from home.

You could not believe how empty that bowl looked.  So they top it off with lettuce to make it look full.  $ 11.00 is a lot for 12 pieces of cubed steak and a half a cup of rice.  But the worst part I was totally ignored until I called.  Thank you for making me feel so unimportant and having to face my daughter empy handed.PS I read the reviews here and they mentioned how great DOS Toros is just around the corner.  Going there after work and will report on the comparison.  Thank goodness for competition.PS2 I complained to the company and they called and said what can i do for you.  I said I have no idea.  They didn't say go back and we will give you a full bowl for your hard earned money.  Also read how a few people wrote how racist they are.  I am glad they don't know im Jewish or they might have been worse."

The workers here are friendly and never give you a hard time. I must have been here at least 100 times and yet to receive a lashing from them. Smile at them and they'll smile right back!The food tastes the same as it does at every other single Chipotle location on the planet. Which means it's pretty damn amazing. I always love to load up on a steak burrito with all the essentials and this place never disappoints. Do NOT come here at 12pm unless you want to be miserable. The line becomes pretty epic. For everyone that works in this area, this seems to be the go-to lunch spot. The other lunch locations nearby, like Subway, Getting Hungry, McDonalds, etc... are unscathed by the wrath of the lunch hour, for all those who want lunch come to this Chipotle. Understandingly so though!"

746,qwUPVBeV6oLdiCKHQvru5w,10/29/2018,1 star rating,"This review is all about expectation and reality. When I approached the counter I had to do a double take because I thought maybe I had walked into ""Chepotle"" or ""Chipotlay"". All of the ingredients looked off. Like counterfeit. Additionally there was no corn or lettuce. Why? I've never been to a chipotle where that's happened. The music is eerily quiet and the employees seem like a they are peeking from out behind a wall of confusion. This sounds crazy but it's almost like they are working at this Chipotle to observe human interaction and learn from it. 1/5 stars would no recommend."

Originally, I rated my initial cappuccino an 8. Then, I had cappuccino at Third Rail, a 10+, and my initial cappuccino went to a 5. This is seriously delicious coffee, right by Washington Square. I have never before reviewed a coffee place, but this one required notice."
749,Jh6wMPv4IK9jUpWMGj4J9g,5/28/2019,1 star rating,"Third Rail went off the rails for me. On a cold day, in a space so small that there are eight seats, maybe ten, and you're next to NYU, with students needing a hang, takeout is your biz. There were people standing out in the cold to get this brew, so I'm sure that it must be wonderful. Unfortunately, weary business traveler I,  I needed to find a place of shelter, to sip my morning clarity, and commune with the web gods for a spell. No room at the Inn, I had to go to Irving Farm around the corner, which was busy, but had a place to sit. I understand the cost of New York commercial space. I ran into a coffee place or two in London of this size. Either get a space where people can stay, or put down no tables, and be take out, with a line that can stay indoors in inclement weather. Or call yourself a coffee club, because it definitely rolls that way when there is not even room for a line to form without standing in the cold."
750,Jh6wMPv4IK9jUpWMGj4J9g,7/9/2018,3 star rating,"VEGAN OPTIONS - Yes. Oat and almond milk. Got a cappuccino that was very well made. However, I was disappointed that they didn't use Counter Culture beans for the espresso, even though they were on display front and center when I walked in. Apparently they use a different roaster for the espresso shots, and while it was ok, it definitely wasn't the best tasting flavour profile. Next time I will ask for the specific beans I want for my shot. Otherwise a well made cappuccino with great consistency and good non-dairy options."

The coffee was good, and average priced. It's not the best size for groups, but with such a close walk to Washington Square Park, I would recommend coming here and then taking your drinks to go for a walk in the park.I also want to give a shout out to the barista working, when I visited - I think his name was Andrew. I was only sitting in the location for maybe 30 minutes, but I was constantly impressed at how welcoming and friendly he was, and also, inclusive. When a customer from Barbados came in, he started asking a bunch of questions and engaging in a dialogue with the man. And then when another customer came in, they started speaking Arabic to each other. It was a very unique multicultural kind of experience that I really valued."

As tiny as a hole in the wall, Third Rail serves counter culture espresso, one of those better local roasted beans in the city. Their cappuccino was creamy, foamy, less intense, yet carried a light nutty fragrance - I simply could not think of a better way to start my morning!Great beans, chill vibes! I have been to their East Village location about a year ago, and this Greenwich village location is consistently good! Wish they could bring more locations into the city, as I'm clearly fall in love with it."
755,Jh6wMPv4IK9jUpWMGj4J9g,7/15/2017,5 star rating,"One of NYC's smallest coffee shops with exceedingly beautifully lattes. Cozy yet modern atmosphere, very anti twee. Limited seating, maybe at most for 10 people, so depending on the time you come in you may or not get a table. I did not see any outlets, nor would I recommend trying to bring work here. Good to visit in the off times with a book, groups less than 3, or anything one to one. The baristas are knowledgeable and friendly. The prices are about average. They offer two different espresso blends, single origin coffee (some brewed within a chemex) and a range of espresso based drinks. I highly recommend their lattes- flawless appearance and taste, a particular, almost nutty flavor from the coffee itself. The cortado is also well done."

It's so pretty and the decor is cute and color scheme is an instagram waiting to happen. I got the chicken tinga taco and my boyfriend got some elote, the mushroom cheddar taco & we split chips and salsa. I'm not usually a huge fan of tacos but this spot was really good especially after a long day of walking around the city. The line was really long and our food took a while to come out which was my only issue with this place but to their defense, we arrived at like 7 on a Sunday so it was bound to happen. Great spot to get pre dinner drinks and chips or just hang with some friends and watch the sunset."

The only problem is they close weirdly early for a Saturday night, as I think staying open later would make it a cool nighttime gathering place. The food here is really good though, and they had options to accommodate my vegan/gf friends. I loved my taco (though there could have been more pineapple, as there was only one piece) and the guac was delicious. Will definitely be back."

Tacocina is a Union Square Hospitality Group joint, The Shake Shack king?!What a location for this restaurant, waterfront no less? What happens in the winter? For now, its sunny and there are outdoor tables. I grab a seat and while my wife waits on line. She ordered two shrimp tacos, a beer and homemade chips & salsa.I'm waiting and waiting and waiting, where the heck is she?? It's been twenty minutes, all for tacos?! Finally, she sees me sitting and comes over. We're waiting for the buzzer to ring. After a few minutes, I take a walk over. As soon as I walk over, the buzzer rings. I'm given a tray and see they put tarter sauce on the tacos.Tarter sauce?? Dudes, what the heck!She swaps out hers for a non tartered up shrimp taco. My taco? It was good, the shrimp was freshThe chips and salsa, the salsa was a weird blend that wasn't chunky and tasted too much like tomato paste.The chips were just deep fried, cut up tortilla shells with kosher salt. All in all, Tacocina was ok. 3 stars from this guy, it didn't wow me. Why is there a long line again?"
761,Jh6wMPv4IK9jUpWMGj4J9g,9/16/2018,3 star rating,"If you're hungry while hanging out in Domino Park - there aren't a lot of options within a block or so.  But fortunately Tacocina is there and they are serving up some decent Mexican food. I say 'decent' because I didn't love the tacos.  They're ok!  But not my favorite in the city... Prices are OK - $4 for a taco is pretty standard in the city.  The portions tho are a little on the small side and I felt like they overdo the cilantro to hide the fact that there wasn't a ton of meat on the tortilla. I did like the seasoning of the chicken adobo taco, just not loving all that cilantro.We also got a small order of the chips/salsa to share.  The portion is good.  The chips are super crunchy and the salsa was simple, liquidy and very tomato-y.  We ended up drizzling it on our tacos for a little extra flavor.Ordering is simple due to the short menu.  And Tacocina is cashless so transactions are also quick.  We visited on a Thursday, late afternoon in the summer and the line to order wasn't too bad (maybe 5-8 people deep).And while the food is ok, for me, it's the location that gets the stars here.  Tacocina is in a fantastic location, especially for summer! Sitting right in the middle of (the newly opened) Domino Park - it's got great views of Manhattan and the East River.  And then the sitting area is so casually comfortable and colorful with umbrellas and a good amount of seating. There's a variety of chair styles - bistro style with small tables, patio chairs, poofs!, benches - so whether your there for a quick bite or to lounge and watch the sunset there's a seat for you."

Even though there is a slight drizzle, the park is completely packed.The menu is short, with just a few snacks and a bunch of different tacos. The winner is definitely the fried cheese taco, and the Cheese Chicharrones for a snack. For vegans, there's a fried mushroom taco too, but it's all about those other cheesy options.This spot will definitely be packed all summer, and with the playground in sight of here, it's definitely going to be a family favorite."

Sadly this place fell short.We had the cheese chicharrones, mushroom taco, pork belly and mango, and beef tacos. Tacos were around $4-$5 each, the chicharrones were $4. Out of all the tacos we tried, the pork belly and mango was the best, I enjoyed the combination of flavors, especially loved the slice of cucumber/ pickle with it. The beef tasted like it was mixed with a mole sauce? They call it salsa negra? Reminds me of mole, also has a bit of fried potatoes on it. The mushroom is a spear of portobello deep fried, this was lacking some flavor. The cheese chicharrones is definitely a unique taste, totally the texture of pork rinds, but cheese flavored when bitten into, not sure how they make this, but I definitely liked this. They gave me the wrong order at first, I realized when I walked away with it, gave it back to them for my correct order, but they gave the orders I gave back to the right person. I'm not sure.. but I thought places aren't supposed to take food back after it's left the counter?? But who am I to say..All in all.. the place isn't bad, but the tacos were kind of skimpy, and I did have to wait a while although the workers there are super nice. It's also in a really nice park with a nice view. Don't think I'll be returning for tacos... chicharrones are debatable if there's no wait though."

Looks like they might use mole for the beef and chicken, too much was used it over powers the taste of the meat, the meat is drenched in it. The shrimp cocktail is on the sweet side. Horchata was very sweet not very authentic. The chips that come with the salsa and guacamole are so awful. Felt like I was going to break a tooth Biting into them. I don't know they just didn't taste right, didn't taste like a tortilla chip more like baked cardboard. For just myself the total was 24 dollars. To feed one whole person with a drink. The price is insane."

If you travel by public transport, you need to travel by bus as there's no nearby subway station to my knowledge. Next to the restaurant is a German supermarket that sells various meat, sausages, krauts, sweets, and many more. The place itself has a very nice, old-style interior that is warm and cozy.They serve a beautiful welcome bread with butter. The bread itself is soft, fluffy, and delicious. I ordered steak tartar, herring salad, and jaegerschnitzel.  I'm an avid fan of raw meat, so it's just natural for me to fall in love with the steak tartar. Delicious ground meat, well seasoned, served on rye, it was definitely a perfect appetizer. The herring salad has beets, potatoes, and various other ingredients chopped up together in a creamy sauce. Again, I LOVE herring but I must say it's rather an acquired taste. Some might find it ""slimy"" or ""fishy"" and the taste could be too strong, but trust me, once you can discover its deliciousness, you'll be addicted. The jaeger schnitzel is HUGE! It's basically fried pork cutlet over potatoes with mushroom gravy. The meat is tender and the sauce is delicious, but I prefer the other two dishes. The side red kraut is wonderful though! Overall though, it was a very nice and hearty lunch.I would have given it a 5 star if not for the questionable service. I walked into the restaurant and there were several empty tables. I waited to be seated because it will be rude to just take an empty table, but I literally just stand there for almost 10 minutes. Several workers passed by and clearly noticed me but they ignored me. Finally one of the older staff greeted me and I wait for a while more until I get seated. However, the food was so good I'd just let this slide but I hope they're friendlier"

Coming from a palette of mostly Asian cuisine, the Veal Jaegerschnitzel was pretty plain and unflavorful on the first bite. What really completed a bite of this dish was the pickled red cabbage that came on the side -- it reminded me of korean kimchi and was a great addition! While the aroma of the mushroom sauce was enticing, the sauce was not a big player in the flavor profile of the bite. Also the serving size of this plate was huge so I would recommend sharing with a friend. My friend got the sausages, which were delicious and an easier introductory dish into this type of cuisine! A definite recommend for a first timer curious about German food. Lastly, I am not a beer person but after hearing my friend talk about how German beer was the best in the world, I ordered myself a Pilsner and I can definitely see the appeal! I would come back and try more dishes, a great first experience into German food!"

We had to ask a waiter to take our order. The food did come out rather quickly. The food was okay. Nothing fabulous. I ordered veal cordon bleu. It was pretty bland. German food is heavy FYI. They eat a lot of sausage, potatoes and gravy. No salad. Keep this in mind when coming here. I thought the house bread was delicious. It's whole wheat. Their best meal is dessert.

Service was fine. The prices grew big time since I was there. And the quality and taste went downhill by a nose dive. The Jagerschnitzel was $32, the Wienerschnitzel was $29, and the Goulash (no more than 5-6 oz) was $7. The food tasted bland, and although the schnitzels are large portion, they're also really thin and stretched out. The home fries were bland and the food was cold. Even the soup was barely warm. The goulash was VERY thing. I remember it to be a hearty cup but this was thin with two small chunks of meat in there. It was really astonishing that it cost $7. I'm glad I visited again because now I know that it's gone downhill I won't ever go back again. It's a shame."

We moved from the area and while visiting a few times recently thought of ordering from here again. I thought my first time back I just got unlucky but after giving them repeating chances I was really surprised and have finally given up. I have to admit it has downgraded severely. The sesame chicken is usually soggy. The chicken broccoli and garlic sauce had no taste to it. The employees are not friendly at all they conduct themselves like they doing us a favor not cool.

It was essentially a mini egg roll. All the spring rolls i've ever ordered, had a different composition of vegetables inside. Again..this was like a small egg roll -_-Rice did not have much taste to it.  Salt didnt help.

787,ND97mueQmRiUKiN3HZ4vcA,10/2/2022,5 star rating,"I'm surprised to see no reviews for the amazing brunch - I've been a brunch regular for almost a year now. The food is consistently great, the decor/atmosphere is lovely and clean, and the staff are attentive and friendly. Bathroom is A+. Seating - weather permitting, sit in the window seats if you can. It's a nice space and great people watching. Note to restaurant: sometimes the music seems a bit unnecessarily loud for brunch. Also has adorable outside seating, just be careful crossing the bike lane. Food (Brunch) - Huevos Rancheros with Short Rib (also comes with their delicious yuca fries), Chilaquiles, and the breakfast sandwich are our favorites. YUCA FRIES. Drinks - Full bar with eight options for brunch cocktails included with the special I will mention below. If you even plan to order two drinks, the brunch special still saves you money.  Service - All the staff are nice and helpful, but Carlos is A+++++. Honestly, he is one of the reasons we keep returning to this spot for brunch. It's hard to find service like this in NYC. Details: Brunch on Sat/Sun is $39, which includes one of the breakfast entrees and ""unlimited"" drinks from the brunch menu (I think unlimited actually means 5). A couple of options are a few dollars extra, like adding short rib to the huevos. Margaritas are also included in the brunch cocktail options, though they aren't listed in that section on the menu. For some reason they don't advertise the brunch special on the website, in case you go looking."

Regardless my friend and I figured we'd try it out on a Monday night. The good: Drinks were on point- mezcal mule was stronger than the margarita. The flavors were really good especially for the al pastor taco, the yucca wedges, and the barbacoa which was added to a quesadilla. Side of guac was decent portion with the quesadilla. Sauce on the calamari was yummy. The not so good: Portions were underwhelming as we both left kinda hungry. The prices did not back up the portions as a $20 beef quesadilla was still small and tacos were $5-$7 for ones the size of your palm (2-3 bites). The calamari could've been crispier and hotter when served. Short rib lacked flavor and was very chewy. Overall: To be honest, I was skeptical because their pricing seems high especially on starters/apps. $15 for guac, $16 for calamari, $15 for a quesadilla...it all seemed a bit higher than it should, even before the current economy. Our bill was about $100 for 2 people for drinks, an app, and ""entrees"" which were 2 tacos vs 1 quesadilla. Had to order a side of yucca because I was still hungry at the end. Staff was friendly, inside was noisy, but outdoor seating was nice. Wouldn't really go back unless some great deal or good HH pricing existed as this wasn't worth the cost."

Super cute place, it has big open windows for good circulation even when sitting inside - huge plus if worried about COVID spike. Dranks: We had a strawberry margarita pitcher and I would say these are the best margaritas I've had in the city. They were not overly sweet (which is a frequent problem you have with margaritas) AND the alcohol was perfect (not lacking and not sooo strong all you taste is tequila but still gives you a nice buzz ). Nomz: After a Margarita pitcher we ordered food, at this point I forgot to take any pictures because I was starving, but it was very nice to look at! I ate the nachos with al pastor and boy were they a flavor bomb. I love nachos and they are so easy to screw up, not this place, still think about them - obviously need to go back! Service was fantastic, our waiter was very attentive and refilled our cups at the perfect time every time and made sure we were properly fed. Very good Spanish music, lots of bad bunny! Cherry on top: not sure if they do this for everyone but we each got a shot of tequila on the house! Overall review: DOPE place - will end up taking my friends here for margs and that's saying a lot because I live in east village."

796,ND97mueQmRiUKiN3HZ4vcA,6/12/2021,5 star rating,"Live around the corner and not sure why it took me so long to finally give it a try - SUCH a great experience, especially since I always walk by it and have always wanted to go in. The vibe and ambiance is right up my alley - I am biased though as a Latina but love that they play reggaeton and bachata and dembow loudly, really adds a great energy and puts you in a good mood instantly.For drinks we got the Paloma and Purple Surprise, both excellent. I actually got the Paloma on the menu and it was spicy and I hated it but it's totally my fault as it said it had Tabasco very clearly on the menu. Bartender was super nice about it and quickly replaced it without Tabasco. The Mahi Mahi fish tacos were *chefs kiss* perfectly cooked and it melted in your mouth. Presentation of the dish was beautiful.Lastly the service was wonderful - very friendly staff and everyone was so chill and casual.EDIT: wrote this review before paying but they gave us two free tequila shots when they brought the check out. Wish I could give it 6 stars!"

I've only had the bubble tea and smoothie and it's always delicious. I judge bubbletea places by the way the tapioca pearls are and here the boba are always soft and sweet.

At first I loved this place bc It appears beautiful, clean and full of healthy fruits and veggie combo smoothies. I realized the smoothies were just too sweet for the ingredients I was ordering. I asked the worker if there are any added sugar in the smoothies? He responded ""no"". I asked if the almond milk was sweetened or unsweetened. He showed me the container of unsweetened so It still didn't make sense. Then I observed them closely as they made my drink and I seen him sneakily put something into my drink that was hidden under the register. I asked ""what is that you just put in my drink?"" And he responded ""honey, you don't like honey?"" I said no I don't want honey and I just asked you if you added anything to the smoothies and you responded no. The liquid substance he put into my drink was not honey. It was a whitish clear simple sugar. I stood there and watched him make 4 more smoothies for people that were sitting down and they add It to EVERY smoothie!!! This is absolutely disgusting that they advertise to be selling healthy smoothies and they're adding a pump of liquid sugar to every single order. Since I've told my friends and family they've all gone there and caught them doing the same thing. They make It sweet so It taste good and you want to go back. The worst part is that it's hidden under the register and they do It quick so the customer doesn't see It. I've been working very hard to diet and and eat healthy. Im paying good money for these smoothies only to find out I've been drinking liquid sugar. I am so disappointed in this establishment."

807,4ybYFlOeJdTyziaFkuc5Fw,2/19/2009,4 star rating,"Tiny trailer-sized New York Diner is wedged in between a gas station and a parking lot on busy Northern Boulevard, seemingly a leftover of another era. Walking in is definitely a bit like walking back in time, as the cliché goes. It's high gloss upholstery and curved lines are straight out of another time in the United States, and perfect for a cheap joint to grab a breakfast.Everything is very high quality for the price, and the friendly owner treats everyone that walks in the door as family, with a greeting and constant attention and gratitude. The food arrives quickly and suits its purpose. The blueberry pancakes ($5.75) and 2 eggs with corned beef hash ($5.95) both were exactly what we were craving when we went in. All washed down by a tall glass of chocolate milk ($2), we paid and emerged back into the real world 60 years later."

Me and the fam go in i see that the waitress looks latin, so i spoke to her in Spanish so she would understand better. I told her i wanted the classic bfast but WITH THE EGGS ON ANOTHER PLATE BECAUSE I AM ALLERGIC. She nods, says ok even repeats it to me. She later brings me the plate WITH THE EGGS ON IT ofcourse. I tell her i cant accept it because the eggs are touching all the other food, she just looks at me silly and says ""ohh"" grabs my plate and goes to talk to the dude cooking. They exchange a bunch of words in spanish for a few mins, i hear the griddles fire up and he starts whipping what seems to be another batch of eggs(mind u, i dont even need the eggs, i need the other stuff lol) few mins pass by and lady brings me back new eggs and what SEEMED to be new homefries and corn hash. I take a few bites, come to find small pcs of egg in my corn hash. I immediately stopped eating and told them wtf is wrong with them for doing that. She grabbed my plate. Walked away and never came back only to hands us our bill, with everything on there(still charged me for the plate i didnt even touch) my lawyers will be contacting them along with local inspectors. Stay away if you have any allergies these pos ppl dont give a flying fck. Be warned."

Food could look great on those big posters  outside the diner but the reality is that this place is soooo bad that I got sick! And not just me, but my crew too! I don't want to be too  explicit  but let's say we were spending more time inside the bathroom than in any orther ""activity The One Star is for the cooks and delivery guys. You can tell they work sooo hard and for long hours but whoever the owner(s) is, he is not providing good quality of eggs, milk, chicken and so on. So these workers are not the ones to blame, they just cook with what the BO$$ gives them to cook with."

The NY Diner is a greasy spoon establishment where corn beef hash with two eggs, potatoes and toast costs less than $7.... take that pretentious Pastis and other Manhattan brunch spots.. if you're looking for upscale this ain't it but you're also in Astoria so join the locals looking to fill up with a fiscally (if not calorically) responsible feast. *** Bring your own syrup if you're craving pancakes they leave their Aunt Jemima bottles out on the tables and the summer heat has not been kind *** Service was excellent and attentive - my friend got mostly fat with his bacon so our waitress brought him more, also she brought over ice and was quick with coffee refills. *** This is the NY diner experience foreigners hope for when they     visit our lovely city."

817,etceI1Kf9CTAu7VpRqy65Q,1/2/2016,2 star rating,"I was really excited to see a Jours Les Tours in Chinatown since I really like their pastries and Pat Bing Su(Korean Shaved Ice) in their W 32nd Street location. It is one of my favorite Korean bakery chain. It's hard for this location since there is so much Chinese bakeries nearby and their prices are almost half the price cheaper. I really like how they had a samples table in the entrance area. So the hot chocolate and ice coffee for me and my friend both was not good. The milk must be at an even balance with the coffee and the chocolate because all we tasted was mainly milk. The bread was only average, I think I can get something similar in the Chinese bakeries! Service is okay. I do intend to come back in the future (possibly at least half a year later) hopefully at that time things will taste better after all they just opened not long ago. I do not want to risk buying their cakes incase it doesn't taste as creamy and fresh like the W32nd Street location."

819,etceI1Kf9CTAu7VpRqy65Q,11/15/2015,3 star rating,This is an attempt to spice up the bakery game in C-Town.  I had to walk in and try out what they had to offer. I noticed the decor was eerily similar to a bakery that started in Bayside and Flushing about two years ago but I will not mention the competitor's name.   I got the Royal Milk Tea and all it taste like was a hot milk tea from a typical bubble tea shop.  I enjoyed the free sample at the door and studied the dynamics of the displays.  It is different and my only wish was that there were either more seating or more room to maneuver.  I felt slightly claustrophobic.  I will return to try other items on the menu in the near future.  The environment is clean and not sticky so I really like that feeling...who wouldn't.
820,etceI1Kf9CTAu7VpRqy65Q,6/17/2020,4 star rating,"I always order special event cakes from Tous Les Jours and their cakes always meet up to my expectations. The ingredients and fruits they use for the cake always seem fresh and tastes sweet. I wish they had more designs for their cakes, but all of their current designs are visually appealing and anyone can find one that they like. Their cakes, however, don't have a lot of choices for flavors, although their matcha and chocolate flavors are really good and I highly recommend them. Aside from their cakes, I also tried their Royal Milk Tea once, and although it was pricey, it suited my taste as well. It wasn't too sweet or too creamy as well. Their products are a little too pricey to get daily for me, but it is worth it. Their store has a cozy atmosphere and I enjoy my time there every time I go."

There are 2 locations in Flushing and one in Manhattan Koreatown. This is touted as a Korean French bakery. I rode my bike past last night and noticed this new shiny store on a pretty dilapidated Division Steet and promised myself I would check it out today. Great addition to this area and let's hope it stays nice and clean (doubt it given it being in a high traffic area). For lunch, I tried their egg salad sandwich ($5.25). It was decent but a bit on the sweet side for me. I could only finish half a sandwich. Ice coffee ($2.50) was fine, decent. For their grand opening, they are putting out free samples of everything. I tried a few things, but they all just tasted the same. Creamy, sweet, and buttery. And for a limited time, if you purchase over $20, you can get a free hamper or tumbler. I'm sure this place will do well as it is centrally located and their pastries are decent."
822,etceI1Kf9CTAu7VpRqy65Q,9/1/2015,4 star rating,"Tous les Jours is the newest addition to Chinatown. It is an upgrade from the local bakeries since some people might prefer french style pastries. Since they just opened, they are suffering between understaffed to overstaffed and exceptionally slow service. Give it a few weeks, I think they will pull through.Despite their slow service, they are much friendlier than those in Koreatown. The cakes from what it seems are apparently cheaper than K Town as well(?).I got the honey bee hamper with a purchase of 20$ today and it's so cute! I would definitely return to this Tous as it is conveniently located in Chinatown."

When you walk in, you will realize that I'm not the only one that shares this same sentiment, as this unassuming ""diner"" is always packed with friendly patrons. Only things that kept me from rating this a full 5 stars:1. I feel that the height of the chairs, retrospective to the tables, should be made taller by 1 inch. My magnificent beard kept dipping into my sunnyside eggs.2. There wasn't a safe place to hang my $600 bicycle helmet."

863,19o6iblcJvz2hdPouYhXgg,12/27/2017,5 star rating,"Y'ALL. This is the ONLY place in all of Brooklyn that I've been able to get a Greek-American-style gyro. Growing up in Montgomery County, Maryland, there were tons of Greek restaurants and every one of them served gyros where the meat came in thinly sliced strips of lamb and beef. And, until now, I hadn't realized this was a Greek-American thing!Many of the gyros I've tried in Brooklyn have chunks of meat that are sliced/shaved but, because they are skewered whole pieces of meat to begin with, they have a different texture/flavor. It's just more reminiscent of BBQ in texture and, often, that's a bit too tough for me. Plus, when I'm craving a gyro, I'm craving what I grew up eating and that's a Greek-American gyro! Side note: My boyfriend ended up discovering all of this because we were so confused as to why the gyros here were so different from what we grew up eating so he Googled it. The reason Greek-American gyros are so soft and flavorful through and through is because they ""are made with a large, sausage-like cone of seasoned minced lamb and beef."" (Thank you, Serious Eats, for the lesson! Haha!) SO - back to Mike's Coffee Shop. They have Greek-American gyros and they are perfect. Get the gyro platter because it comes with some delicious fries. The sauce and lettuce and tomato and onion was all perfect with just the right amount of each. And now I'm craving another one even though I literally just ate this like 2 days ago.

Absolutely loved the funky ambience of this bar and the drinks and tapas were great! We went around 9:00pm on a Saturday as a party of 4 (we did not have a reservation beforehand). We were told it would be an hour and a half wait before we could be seated with a table. This wasn't an issue with us, we just walked around the area and grabbed a quick drink at a nearby bar. We were seated downstairs which was decorated with a bunch of posters and colorful fairy lights. We ordered the toki highball, melon lime soda, panda fizz, and paloma ano nuevo which all tasted great. We also got the karaage calamari and the nori fries which paired very well with the drinks! Both were enough to share between 4 people. The servers and host were very friendly and accommodating as well. I would definitely come back and would highly recommend!"

They sure know how to make a great well balanced cocktail! Definitely live up to its title of being one of the top 50 bars of the world. I got their specialty drink- the hinoki martini . Hands down the best martini I've ever had in my life. Martini used to be my go to cocktail, but I've never had a martini where it doesn't taste like straight alcohol, BUT THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT . It was such a well balanced drink,  and you can tell it was very well made Service: we went on Valentine's Day around dinner time, so it was quite busy, and can be difficult to flag down the waitressOverall: definitely recommend and I would come back!"

An 80's Japanese fever dream is how I would describe this and is definitely my aesthetic which immediately won me over. Japanese cuisine in a staple in our household, and this place exceeded expectations. The aesthetic is on point and all the food is incredible. The seating was a little precarious: we were seated next to a little cubby hole with a ledge jutting out from the wall. My gf and I are troopers so we tried to make the most of it as we already waited an hour to get in. Everything that we tried was incredible, but the mortadella katsu sandwich was by far the best. The cocktails are great, too! We tried a Toki highball that came with a plum pickle for garnish, and an amoreto-esque cocktail that was delicious. The bar staff clearly enjoyed working there. They were vibing to the 80s themed soundtrack, while banging on the metal rails with bar spoons to the beat which put everyone in a great mood.The (presumed) manager was very engaging and present on the floor. She stopped by while we were looking around the bar at the whiskies and brought back a by-request-only menu. The selections are pretty diverse, and the prices are a bit up and down, but the overall value is incredibly high with lots to choose from.We loved this place so much that we bought a shirt from their merch to bring home. Will definitely come back again if we're ever in New York again. Great job to you all"

This bi-level space lit up by neon lights certainly gives patrons an inviting atmosphere to look forward to after an hour long wait.I came in on a Friday night with a group of 6, and had to wait ~45 mins to get a table. They don't take reservations so be prepared to wait for a while, but there are several options in the West Village to grab a drink before being seated. Katana has tons of small bites and cocktails to choose from and is definitely a fun place to catch up with friends. I wasn't very impressed with either the small plates or cocktails, but perhaps I had higher expectations given their prestigious ranking. We ordered the cucumber salad, karaage calamari, soy garlic wings, nori fries, and pork ribs (so basically half of the menu) and everything was fine but didn't stand out from any other izakaya that I've been to. Next time I'd stick to just grabbing drinks here after dinner, since their highballs were different from others that i've had before."

I said I'm not giving you a tip for a delivery that took almost 2 hours. He walks away and then says f**k you loud and repeatedly. I called the restaurant and told them what happened and that I would never order from them again and would give a bad review! Totally unprofessional for burnt, cold food!

We finally place our order... the two younger women place their order and their food comes before ours... they receive their drinks... we had to ask for our glasses of water... our food finally comes the waitress never asks how the food is or anything, never picks up the plates that we were finished with and when placing the food down on the table she does it in a rush and almost places the plate on top of another plate that's occupied with food.... overall the food wasn't bad however the customer service and interaction was terrible.

Fresh ingredients (the avocados are never brown or mushy, the fish smells good and tastes fresh, etc.). They deliver quickly. They are open late (later than the neighbouring restaurants! (11pm)). They give you a cut up orange with the check.  Con: They raised their prices. It's not terrible,  but I miss the cheap rolls. (Pro- I think it's cheaper than the neighbouring sushi place on ave U by key food)Overall, I really like this place; good service, good food."

I still gave them a shot and hoped my roll would be good, but it really did not taste fresh. I'm not planning on going back again"

It was about 22 people at our table and I must say our waiter (can't remember his name but very funny, lots of jokes and he's from greece) was a gem. He handled our table well, attentive to everyone and made sure we were good. Our orders as well didnt take long to come to us bearing in mind our large numbers.I had the pan sauteed salmon with the couscous and radish. The salmon was done medium and tasted really good. The couscous was a different taste for my palette but after many bites I got accustomed. We also ordered garlic fries and omg I could've eaten that alone for dinner lol it tasted good and filling!All in all I had a wonderful time and 2oupd definitely be back!"

We had to flag down our server to order  our entrees after we had been sitting for more then 30 minutes and then we eventually had to track down a different server to get our check after it appeared that our sever had disappeared.

They have lots of really cute red booths, a full bar, and are part of the Wyndham hotel so if you are staying there you can also charge your bill directly to the room. Additionally for New York standards this restaurant is pretty well priced. In terms of the menu and food, there are lots of really good options from gluten free pastas, to vegan entrees. And for those of you like my sister who don't like Italian food but always get dragged to Italian restaurants, there is lots of American fare as well. The food was pretty good. The pasta was full of flavor and the scallops were extremely fresh and cooked just right. Where this restaurant loses a star is in the service. Often times we had to ask for things multiple times because the waitress forgot. In addition our cups were never refilled with water from when they first became empty. There were only 4 occupied tables at the time and 5 waitresses, so we didn't understand why every request that we had took a long time to occur."

When I returned to my office I saw that my card had been charged twice instead of the original charge being refunded. I called the store to ask for the refund again and was told I had to return in person. I sent two emails to Just Salad and tweeted at them and have received no response.

904,zzrm1Da_CuUU-X0wzPTCCQ,10/26/2018,2 star rating,This place used to be really good. But recently they have stopped paying attention to customer service. They have stopped chopping their salads which makes it a tad bit difficult to eat them. Also the ingredients do not mix well and you feel like you are eating a whole lot of leaves. I ordered a buffalo chicken and there were hardly 3-4 pieces of chicken in it. The person making the salad seemed to be in too much haste even when there were hardly 2-3 people in the line. They need to up their game a little to compete with the other wonderful places in the fidi. Especially when they charge a good amount of money.

909,3BGG2nlFs_TOkRCC2j3m5Q,9/29/2019,4 star rating,"I mealpal lunch here about once a week, and occasionally pay full price for dinner.  I don't understand why Just Salad isn't more popular. The salads are good, healthy, and pretty big.The quality of ingredients may be a little lower than Sweet Greens, but the value is much higher, and because it isn't as trendy, the lines are not nearly as long.  Part of why the value is better is because the salads are much more filling.The service at this location is pretty good and efficient.In particular, the salads they have already created (the recipes...they don't have premade salad sitting there) are a fantastic value, and they are very flexible on substitutions.One other Sweet Green comparison: I love some of the dressings at Sweet Green, but there are few, and they don't really work that well with the salads sometimes...I think of them more like dips.  I like the Just Salad ones more, and there is such a big selection."

Even when it's busy, they're very efficient.  My order is always correct, they get me out of there quickly, and they have THE BEST EMPLOYEE EVER -- Kevin.  If you're lucky enough to get Kevin, you're going to have a great lunch, and probably a great rest of your day.  His energy is fantastic, he's the nicest person in the world, and he's just lovely.  More generally, the food is always fresh and there are so many choices of ingredients, they make it easy to not get bored of eating healthy.  Thanks, Kevin!!!!"

Healthier alternatives and clear to how more calories they are and what ingredients is in it. You order and they help you like how subway works, and you can add or substitute something. First substitution is always free but after it's extra. You have pay $1 for a recyclable blue bowl and use it twice than return it and it's eco friendly. The utensils and containers' lid is still plastic but the bowl or packaging or bag itself are all recyclable. Friendly staffs and pretty fast. People in and out, usually people take it to go but you can definitely eat there too. It's never packed so the line isn't bad. Walkable to the red subway line and across the street from the L train and blue subway line. Not my favourite spot but definitely a place I'd come back to. I do recommend it too"

This is way TMI for a Yelp review, but the backstory is necessary to show how much his actions meant to me-I lost my debit card last week and am waiting til I go back to LA to order a new one bc of a mailing situation, so I've been having to get cash out each day from the bank. So it's a Sunday and I ran out of cash and had no money for dinner, but found a $50 gift card that my friend gave me for Christmas. So I'm all stoked and running down to Just Salad before it closes to I can eat. I get to the checkout and Curtis tells me that my card expired (which is total bullshit that a company can just keep my $50 like that????) ANYHOO. I'm super sad and tell him he can just cancel my order, but he goes ahead and tells me that the salad is on him. IT MADE MY DAY SO MUCH I REALLY ALMOST CRIED. I needed that salad. Thank you so much Curtis!! I just wanted you to know how much your actions meant to me. I came back today and he was working and remembered me. That made my day too. Yennifer was working the checkout and she was so kind and lovely. Just Salad- you have some amazing employees and I hope you give them all a big fat ass raise because they make your company fantastic. xxLauren"

The slaw is basically a salad you get at Japanese restaurants. Both tacos were excellent and had a gyoza hard shell, that was more flavored and fried than a regular shell. The shrimp taco was better, and both flavorful and refreshing; the curry beef was good too, but did not have as much flavor as I would have expected."
946,ccOVk-FV2D4qhVXObofs1Q,10/25/2022,5 star rating,Loved the food!  The tuna and shrimp tacos were delicious!  The lychee tea was refreshing and very tasty!  Would definitely come back!
947,ccOVk-FV2D4qhVXObofs1Q,10/22/2021,3 star rating,"Just get the tacos! I came here with friends to grab a quick bite at Chelsea Market and was intrigued by the fusion. I got 2 tacos (the curry beef and spicy tuna) and my friends tried the burrito and the nachos. I thought the tacos were so yummy, the taco was super crispy (and I think it was rice based) and the fillings were so flavorful. However, my friends thought the burrito was pretty plain and dry and the nachos I tried were also dry and unflavorful. They were looking for a little more food which is why they got nachos but it turned out to be a pretty small portion and the chips that came with it wasn't that good as well.Come Again? Probably not usually there's better food in NYC but maybe I'd come again just for a taco or two if I want a snack."

I've never had Japanese Tacos so decided to stop here and I'm so glad I did. I have never had more tender, juicy tacos, and then they had their own little flare. Very very good. I'm definitely a fan. The only rub is it's so hard to get a seat, you may have to stand in line for 20 minutes to sit."

951,ccOVk-FV2D4qhVXObofs1Q,10/24/2021,5 star rating,"A fusion I didn't know I needed in my life! We came here hungry for tacos, initially looking to grab Los Tacos nearby. When I saw their line of 200+ people I figured better check out this cool looking Japanese taco place - though I was admittedly scared of how such a crossover would turn out. Well, apparently these folks have tapped into some flavor combinations more people need to experience! I'm usually more of a soft taco person, but the crunchy curry beef taco impressed me the most. The curry was very flavorful, and the hard shell helped hold it all in without getting messy. I could have easily crushed about 8 of those if I didn't know better. The other flavor I tried was the short rib taco, which was also delicious. The bento box combo also comes with some chips and a side. I picked the slaw which was tastier and a lot healthier than average cole slaw due to the edamame.Overall, Takumi Taco is a very underrated stop within Chelsea Market. Yes there are other great places there too like of course Los Tacos, but it's good to try some new things too! And at least you don't have to wait an hour in line here."

We opted for the chicken adobo taco and their  Japanese curry beef taco with a side of the charred corn salad. Both tacos were surprisingly good, however the Japanese curry taco was more flavorful in my opinion. The charred corn salad was basically a refreshing corn/black bean salsa.It's counter service so it's easy breezy and straight to the point."

I also got the lychee lemonade. Tacos were great! I really liked the shrimp one. The chicken adobo had food flavors too but was a bit dry. Adding the salsa def. Helped. Lychee lemonade was delish.

955,Kks8q-ASmES11UNpmJ82zA,10/4/2021,4 star rating,"Patrick Steakhouse serves up a large variety of steak cuts at a reasonable price! All their steaks come with 2 sides and 1 sauce. We got the ribeye with creamed spinach, fries and their homemade Asian steak sauce. We loved the cream spinach and Asian steak sauce, while the French fries were average. They had about 5-6 sauces to choose from and all sounded great, so will certainly try some others the next time I come. The crispy chicken wings were still very crispy even though they were coated a great pineapple barbecue sauce on it. However, they are a bit pricey at $14 for only 5-6 wings. Lastly, the cocktails were hit or miss. The grenade was way too sweet, while the Tropic was a smooth and strong drink. On their website it says they have a happy hour daily until 7PM however we got there at 6:30 or so on a Friday and they said they did not have any deals. They possibly only have it Monday to Thursday? This places has great vibes, beautiful artwork in the back and seemed to have some entertainment in the evenings. I will definitely be back!"

From the classic steahouse feel inside to the chill atmosphere in the back yard. It has the potential to be a real local gem. We ordered the cesar salad and crab cakes for starters. The crab cakes had a beautiful sauce and pickled cucumbers. The salad however was lackluster. No Parm and the dressing tasted store brought. While in rome...you order steak! We tried the skirt steak and the NY strip both steaks were delicious and paired with garlic butter.  The sides to it were lukewarm in temperature but they were tasty as well. Overall, we had a great time and patrons were enjoying themsrlves. I will try again and even check out their brunch. I have a feeling that a different cook will give me a better experience."

We arrived about 7pm we didn't have to wait  for a table. The backyard was full so we was seated inside. There was a good selection of music playing. Our waitress Bella was very pleasant.The appetizers: crab cakes & coconut shrimp was good. I do wish we had all got our own crab cakes thought lol. We didnt know it would only be 3. They were good though & so was the sauce on the side. I ordered the salmon w mashed potatoes and veggies. I didnt care for the salmon as it was a bit dry. I did enjoy the veggies. One daughter ordered a steak. She wasn't really impressed And my other daughter chose the lamp chops. The both of them said the lamb chop was the best out of each entree we ordered. *The brunch menu is available all day on SundayOverall it was okay. I doubt we'd return as we weren't blown away with the main dishes.
958,Kks8q-ASmES11UNpmJ82zA,4/18/2022,4 star rating,Service with a smile. One thing I can say about this place is they serve big portions. I had previously went to a well established steakhouse and the food and service was depressing. Coming to Patrick's was a breath of fresh air. The crab cakes were really good and the sauce with it was great. I don't have any pictures of the mojito but it was awesomeness. I had two and the table had about 5 in total. They had daiquiris and coladas too that were great. The place was empty that night so service was quick and pleasant from the time I walked in. I will return.

They played a mixture of old school and new school hip hop, r&b, reggae, and Afro beats. The team comes out with personalized signs, sparkling candles and cake all while singing for the birthday person. The server, E, was very accommodating (apparently he usually works the bar, but did a great job working the floor) The food came out quick and was pretty good.

We have traveled the world and that's a huge statement to make. We stand behind it. The con: it's just too damn loud. You can't come here for a nice intimate dinner with your significant other or date and talk... unless you like it really loud....

Everyone who worked their was so sweet and pleasant. I wish I lived in NY so I could visit frequently. The food was good. Everything is vegan. I got the chicken and waffles. I'm always amazed at the wizardry of turning a mushroom into chicken, lol. My only criticism is that the food could have been warmer, and they could have been more generous with the syrup, but it tasted delicious. They brought more syrup when asked, so no biggie. And I'm sure if I had mentioned it, they would have happily warmed my food up for me because that's how nice and accommodating they were.We met Michael, the operator of this restaurant, and the restaurant next door to it, Cadence. He actually showed us Cadence even though it wasn't open for business until later in the day because I'm really into interior design and mentioned wanting to see the wallpaper with the bird seen in some of the older pictures. But that was before they turned that side of the restaurant into Cadence. So the wallpaper has been covered up, but it's still nice. I loved the he mentioned that he only uses black wine sellers because they have such low visibility in the market. How awesome is that?! So one day, I'll be back to visit Cadence, too. But until then, I highly recommend Ladybird. Come for the food, stay for the ambiance."

The best vegan cheese I've ever had.Kale Caesar was refreshing and had yummy crunchy bacon bits.Kfb was noice. I had never had breaded and fried broccoli before. The sauce was savory, not to sweet.Service was kind and attentive.All of this was about $111 plus tip. Pretty sweet. This is my friend's favorite vegan place, and it's clear why."
968,ccOVk-FV2D4qhVXObofs1Q,3/20/2022,4 star rating,"TBH Good but not great. What made this great was the really nice host   and the atmosphere. Otherwise, the vegan fare we ordered was stuff you could *probably* make at home (delicious but not incredible for the price point) and for a cocktail bar serving only wine based drinks, it was a wee misleading.Kale Caesar Salad 3/5: Idk. It was huge pieces of kale in a caesar dressing with vegan parm and croutons. It was good. The kale could've been ripped into smaller bits and it's not like this dish is particularly hard to swing. With nothing else going on in the salad, this was good but not great.Tofu Bao Bun 3.5/5: I liked this; similar to a peking duck bun but with tofu, the tofu had a sweet plum sauce and veggies. The bao was soft. For $7 it wasn't necessarily stuffed with ingredients. I wish there was more tofu, a little less sauce.Buffalo Mitake Bun 4/5: I liked this one a bit more than the tofu because I really liked the fried mushroom. The sauce had an interesting undertone though that I am not sure I really loved. Again, for $7 it could've been way more stuffed. Both baos had a lot of bread leftover. Mushroom toast 5/5: This was the best thing on the menu we ordered. It was tangy from the balsamic, lots of mushrooms, and herbal from the microgreens. Again, for $15 I'm sure you could sautee some mushrooms + onions in balsamic vin, vegan butter and seasonings and make it at home. We got the Ladybird Reunion cocktail which I really liked but it was a little sweet from the passionfruit syrup I believe, but the rose was balancing that out.  We also got the Sharp Tailed Grouse which was refreshing and the Cockatiel which was a pina colada basically (a little sweet). Serving only wine based cocktails at a ""cocktail bar"" isn't really transparent marketing, eh? Like $16 for a glass of wine with syrups and bitters isn't exactly worth it in my opinion. Overall, this place is good but I expected so much more, especially on the reviews. Maybe we got the wrong things but we just did what the waitress said and we ended up liking our own choice the most."

We had the truffle mac (with a perfect amount of breadcrumb topping) po boy bao buns, and potatoes au gratin (with delicious caramelized onion) which were all good. The KFB was excellent and definitely the best plate we ordered. Service was attentive. We ended up hanging around to order desert and shared the chocolate fondue. This would definitely be enough for 3 people as we had plenty left over. The only downside was the space itself. We were seating in a cramped corner with two tables shoved in the place where one could realistically go. It was uncomfortable enough that others were refusing to be seated there. I would likely only return to sit on the patio area."

This tapas and wine bar opened in 2016 and is totally vegan. The interior alone is an Instagrammers dream. I love the greenery, mismatched chinaware, velvet chairs, and cozy feel here. I recommend making your reservation in advance on their website.My friend and I ordered a few dishes to share and all of them were beyond delicious. We got a little carried away and definitely ordered more than we could eat, but I don't regret it. A few of my favorites were the Brussels Sprouts (so crispy!!) and the PO Boy Bao. Here's a breakdown of everything we ordered:PO Boy Bao - cauliflower, spicy aioli, cornichon, sesame seed, lettuce, tomatoBrussels Sprouts - endive, apple, quinoa, soy truffle, vinaigretteTruffle Mac & Cheese - truffle oil, breadcrumbs, seared mushroom (we added the mushroom bacon for an additional $4)KFB - tempura fried broccoli, gochujang tamari sauce, sesame, scallionsWe also each ordered the Ladybird Reunion, a cocktail made with Lillet Rosé, rose, lemon, basil simple syrup, Passionfruit, Tiki Bitter, and basil. For only $4, you can add a sidecar of bubbles. I recommend!The only criticism that I have is that they're listed as a ""Cocktail Bar"" on Yelp, but only served a variety of wine cocktails... So, they're more like a wine bar. Other than that, Ladybird exceeded my high expectations. I can't wait to come back again!"

I loved the menu's variety of cuisines and creative uses of vegetables in tapas forms. Normally, vegan restaurants make their food carb-heavy to compensate for taste, but Ladybird is still very vegetable-centric. My favorite dish here are the KFC (Korean fried cauliflower). The sauce is savory, tangy, and the perfect complement to fried cauliflower. The portion size is decent and 3-4 plates for two is enough!"

The broccoli was battered well and then smothered in a thick and tangy sweet and spicy sauce. The portion was large and definitely enough to comfortably share. The truffle Mac and cheese was outstanding, truly some of the best vegan Mac and cheese I have ever had. It had a mouthwatering truffle aroma and a rich and velvety mornay sauce, along with sautéed mushrooms. It was very decadent and I definitely could not have finished it on my own. Overall the service was pretty good throughout and I will definitely be back. My only critique is that the bathroom is kind of in an awkward spot with a sliding door and it's hard to tell if it's occupied or not."

Importantly, the sommelier not only described each wine but explained why it was chosen for the particular dish. Service was good. However, the pacing was off and made me feel rushed. I ordered a cocktail. The amuse bouche and first glass of wine arrived about one minute after the cocktail. I didn't have time to enjoy the cocktail before the meal started. The couple at the table next to mine also said they felt pushed. Twice, a server tried to remove a dish before a guest had finished. The second time, he asked ""why do you think I have finished eating that?""I enjoyed the meal despite the rush. Still, it was a small flaw but at these prices the timing should be impeccable."

Service was top-notch and our server was attentive and knowledgable and explained each dish to us. We started off with their specialty cocktails- The Sultan's Daughter and Noce E Fico and decided on the the four course prix fixe. For appetizers- we ordered the Vellutata (lobster soup) and Tartare di Carne to start. Both were solid choices! For pasta- we ordered the trofie nero (squid ink pasta with scallops) and Blue crab spaghetti. The trofie nero was flavorful and the crumbles on top added a good crunch with each bite. The blue crab spaghetti might just be one of the best pasta I ever had. The blue crab was sweet and plump and the spaghetti was cooked perfect al dente and was not overly creamy or rich. The extra hint of chilli spice made it delicious! Highly recommend both pastas! For entrée- we ordered the butter poached lobster, which just simply melts in your mouth and the halibut was cooked to perfection, but I found it a tad bit salty. For dessert- we decided on the torta di formaggio and cioccolato. Both were delicious! They also gave us complimentary chocolate bon bons at the end.Ai Fiori is definitely worth it for a special occasion, but make sure you make reservations well in advance!"

Guess I'm going against the grain among a sea of ""Zomg, my first Michelin-starred restaurant!!!!1"" and ""We celebrated our aNniVeRsAry here!!!!"" 5-star reviews.Ai Fiori was average at best. We did the four-course prix fixe and got the Tartare di Carne and Polipo to start; the Trofie Nero and Spaghetti for pasta; the Astice as both entrees; and the Torta di Limone and Cubetto di Cioccolato for dessert. To imbibe, we got the Royal Blush and the Rubies and Roses.In terms of technique, the dishes/drinks were all prepared, cooked and presented well. But nothing was particularly noteworthy, and some things like the Astice had me scratching my head. Why pair a succulent lobster tail, lentils and savory buerre sauce, with julienned apple drowning in sour vinaigrette? The vinaigrette was so pungent that I couldn't even enjoy the lobster and lentils because it kept seeping into that side of the plate--and the smell was awful.Where Ai Fiori really lost me was the service. Our server was nice but barely there. It took us 10 minutes of sitting at our table with no menus before she even appeared. And trying to flag her just to get the bill was a 20-min exercise in frustrating futility. I know restaurants are struggling with service issues right now, but there were so many staff milling around that I don't think this particular case was due to to a lack of personnel. It just seemed like poor organization.Clientele is a mix of old white men who look like extras on Billions, trustafarians, trendy couples, and botoxed ladies who look like extras on Real Housewives.I've had better experiences at pasta restaurants with no Michelin stars.

However, I was definitely disappointed. The only dish that I liked was the squid ink pastas. As a pasta lover, I think the sauce was perfectly flavored and pasta tasted like it was handmade. However, all the other dishes tasted somewhat weird. Either too salty, too sour, or just not enough flavor.

You are allotted two hours for your dinning experience, when making reservations online, but if you dine on a weekday, and not on peak times, you will be able to enjoy for as long as you'd like, which is what we did.The ambiance is relaxing, classy, and understated-upscale. Definitely dress up, although plenty of diners were donning casual attire. Pleasant music playing on the background. Perfect for a special occasion.Prices warrant the special occasion. The food menu is not very extensive, and prices are not cheap. Portions are small-this is an experience to savor. Waiters recommend the pre-fix tasting menus [$114 per person for four courses, or $175 per person for seven courses]. We went with ordering a la carte.Complementary bread and butter are served. Don't be shy to ask for seconds.$25 lobster soup was delicious. However, it was served without croutons or black truffles, like claimed in the menu. Very delicate flavor. The lobster pieces were super fresh and tender--you could tell that the lobster was still crawling earlier that day.$37 for all pastas and risottos. Pastas are made in-house daily, and you could tell by the taste and texture. Trofie Nero was slightly piquant and bursting with flavor. Tiny scallops were fresh and tender, as well as seppia and mollica [variation of squid]. Recommend this dish. Pasta was slightly chewy, which I like. Spaghetti was tasty as well. Tarragon really added flavor to the garlic butter sauce. Blue crab was super delicate, but there was very little of it compared to the amount of pasta.$15 for all desserts. Torta di limone was a let-down not only for us but also for the table next to us, who ordered the same thing. The flavors were very understated and something was missing. Subtly sweet, not your typical American overpowering sweet. This dessert needed an element of highlight, to make it memorable and complete. Also, it was supposed to be served with ice scream, but that was not the case that night.Cubetto di cioccolato was the highlight of our meal. This was a truly spectacular dessert. It was complex, intricate, and well-thought out. Every element was perfectly designed to complement all the ingredients and the composition of the dish. Not sweet, but earthy and savory, the focus of this dessert on black sesame bean. Every element incorporated black sesame in some way, from ice cream to ganache to filling to chocolate. I enjoyed every bite and tried to savor it for as long as I could. Definitely get this"

The place is big inside, pool table, some video games, an awesome jukebox, and cheap I MEAN CHEAP DRINKS. We ordered 3 beers and a jack and coke only $17.50 tell me where you can find drinks this cheap. The decor inside is like a typical bar but they have really cute lamps on the walls and some of the tables have Asian theme on them. Another good thing is that the bartenders are actually awesome. They were taking shots right with us. The bathrooms are clean as well which is always a plus. The train is steps away from the bar. I mean the bar was somewhat empty but it's always a good time when you are with your friends. I highly recommend this place we have gone twice in one week."

When you see the bar from the outside it seems to be very small but when you make your way in it gets so much larger. Most of the people here are locals but that doesnt matter. When i first came here i thought it was going to be boring. This was my first bar trip ever. After drinking a few then we made our way to the only pool table there is and had a blast. I met this asian guy with dreadlocks and we played doubles. They were really great at 3am.

994,ccOVk-FV2D4qhVXObofs1Q,8/3/2011,2 star rating,"Great for meeting or getting sloshed around underagers, apparently.  The server Caitlin is great.  But she will usually be accompanied by a chickentender who's to appeal to another demographic, but won't seem to be as thoughtfully hired as she won't be as good.  One even forgot she charged me for a drink already, and tried to charge me twice (as if you don't handle your first drink expense after immediately getting served, this also means she forgot I already tipped her GENEROUSLY, plus she immediately reached for the high-shelf stuff for my drink without asking - what a nub!)  What was bad was how she was a completely unprofessional mule about it - even her coworker had to tell her not to be such a month-rag.  Also, doesn't cover the fact that this is the bar on my corner (way to alienate a potential regular) oh, and that I'm also a midtown bartender who appreciates service (and do better for myself than ripping off one 6 dollar drink. . . .)  Overall the incident clouds my judgement of winner's greatly, since its offensive and I know my managers would ream me out for handling this how she did, and for good reason.   It's drunken newbie bartender antics that you can expect, but sure, the drinks are also cheap and very strong.  Make it a dive, go for the trash, but get out before becoming part of the decor. Make sure the less-cool bartender remembers you already slipped money towards her mule-face."

1000,Kks8q-ASmES11UNpmJ82zA,6/14/2019,3 star rating,"Twice in 1 week I was very disappointed with my experience here.. The first thing was a dish called the ASCH loop. It is described as: seasoned potatoes, sausage, egg and cheese. Sounded good. When I got to work I opened up the container and found mostly potatoes mixed with pieces of sausage, browned ( over cooked ) egg pieces and some cheese that obviously melted into the entire mess. Nothing but the potatoes was really recognizable and the entire visual presentation was  like someone dumped all of this food mush into a container and closed the lid quickly. The next day I figured I would just go back to a sesame bagel with vegetable cream cheese. Well, that's what I ordered. When I got to work I opened up my bag to a plain bagel with butter. I paid $5.50 for a large coffee and  this?Called Bagels on Bartow and  staff did say that the kitchen incorrectly labeled the bag.  So someone that wanted a plain bagel with butter got my toasted sesame with veggie cream cheese ?After traveling to work ( about an hour later) the plain bagel was tasteless and the butter did nothing to help the matter. I was told that I could get back the price difference  of this order and what I ordered. Thanks, and I will do this. However for 2 days in a row my breakfast was ruined and not at a cheap price.Like I said, bagels are good,but they gotta do better with the orders, and I don't even know what the solution is to that ""ASCH loop"" thing."

It's located in a strip mall but around the corner. It definitely a weird location in the strip mall. When we walked in I definitely wasn't impressed. It looked like a run down joint. I ordered a bacon egg and cheese on a bagel bc the cream cheese did not look good. There are only like 4 tables in the place so seating is very limited. We waiting for someone to leave to get a seat. The food didn't take long.Once I started eating I knew that the bagels aren't made on location. Food was edible but I felt they gave me one egg and 2 strips of bacon. It was extremely dry bc of that. Not worth the drive to Bartow.

Not anything but... ziti, spaghetti, meatballs, chicken cutlets, a huge salad bar, different vegetables, grilled chicken, chicken wings, fruits, roasted potatoes, fish, chicken parm etc... they switch it up so it's not always the same. The hot foods stay heated at a good temperature and the cold foods are chilled properly. You can also get a sandwich made however you like. You can see them make it right in front of you. They have a small section where you can sit and eat your food as well. There's a large selection of beverages to choose from. I've never gone here and have to wait in a long line.

A pretty solid bagel - I grade my bagels based on whether or not there are any bites that resist me (I don't want to be pulling with my teeth at a bagel to get it to accept its fate). There were like maybe 15% of bites where there was resistance which I didn't love. However they didn't skimp with the filling and it was pretty flavorful inside. I wish the everything bagel was seasoned on both sides. It was warm and fresh however. This place might keep its spot in the top 10 bagel spots for me, and is a local stable serving the NYU community and I'm glad it's there for them. I can see myself coming back here if I were in the area and in the mood for a bagel."

I've even had these bagels delivered to me in Texas. Hands-down the best. It'll make you kinda wish you never tried it because you'll never be as satisfied with other bagels. At least not as much.The Astor bagel sandwich may as well have been designed for me. Some nice turkey, excellent crispy bacon, lettuce, and jalapeno asiago cream cheese inside of a bagel of your choice. I typically go for everything, but sometimes mix it up with a more subtle bagel since everything can be a bit much.Lox bagels are a treat to me and typically a favorite. The Cooper is the lox bagel here and it comes with avocado. Boy do I bet a lot of people love that, I know we sure did.The bagels themselves are so darn good. I can't explain it, but the texture is perfect, and the everything bagel itself is nice and salty that you can eat it straight-up.On that note, the jalapeno asiago cream cheese. Normally things with jalapeno only keep the jalapeno flavor, but this cream cheese actually had spice. And tons of flavor. This cream cheese is absolutely a must-have in my book. Bacon scallion is also really good! But man, jalapeno asiago is divine.Wish I had more pics from my various visits, but these bagels are always consumed in awkward places for me."

We took the advise of friend to try the Everything Bagel, which for us novices has sesame seeds, poppy seeds, dried onion and some garlic.  That was great.2. We tried two spreads, the herb and garlic and the scallion. The scallion again, was a recommendation.3.  These bagels were the bomb! I loved the scallion spread and really enjoyed the everything bagel.In a way, I felt like I was in a Seinfield episode of the food Nazi!  There is a line.  You go to one person to spit out  your very clear menu and then you step away to the cashier to pay.  If you are hanging about checking out the spreads, or contemplating which bagel to order and which spread, I would venture to guess you will not be a favorite of the person taking the order, and the people in line behind you!!!I wanted to come back another day for a lunch or dinner, but I could not find the time.  We did get a bagel at the airport on the way home and well, it wasn't the same, but that was because at the airport, the choices were limited and the ordering was just odd!Great bagel, but really have no idea if this is any better than bagels on the west coast! :(  :(  :("

They have a plethora of options for different cream cheeses and bagels to choose from, so I decided on a salmon lox with scallion cream cheese and it was... absolutely... DELICIOUS! Every bite was packed with such powerful flavor, and the smoked salmon was so fresh! Also, they loaded the portions for what you are paying, and the customer service was both efficient, and friendly so it felt like they were not rushing me out of the store, regardless of how busy it was.

Service is solid, the menu is standard, the food is above average. The food is hit or miss in my experience. I attended a small dinner party there this week. The cold antipasto was very good, loaded with salami, pepperoni, mozzarella, roasted peppers and lettuce. The fried calamari was good, slightly greasy but their sauce is very good. The pizza was good, thin crust, bar pie style. Pasta with Vodka sauce was served, the sauce itself was ok, the prosciutto was cut into cubes and sautéed which is not my preference.The entrees were ok, Sole Oreganata was above par although slightly fishy. The chicken sorrentino was a handsome dish but lacked flavor in my opinion. The potato croquettes that were served with the entrees might have been some of the best I have ever had.

Just getting across this road is like crossing a highway. Food was Ok. Blackened salmon was fine but only came with a potato croquette and wilted spinach.

This was my first trip to the Outerbridge location, which I enjoyed very much.The wine game here is strong. The pours of wine are generous, and that's my kind of wine pour, believe that. Many of the guests don't eat meat, so they offered a flaky, tender filet of sole. Classy move, because tilapia is gross. I had chicken Marsala and loved it. The portion was too big, so I brought home most of it for Teddy.Besides from the tasty food, the service was really on point! The waiters were prompt and gracious with refills and checking in.

When I came in and ordered I sat down. They asked me if I wanted to come back. I asked how long it was going to take, they said 10 minutes. I said ok I'll be back and they said ok come back in 15-20 minutes . I come back in 15-20 minutes  and food still wasn't done. I waited an extra 20-25 minutes in store. No one seemed to know anything they were doing, like they were winging it. The owner apologized for the wait and thanked me for my patience by giving me $2 in cash cause he couldn't take the $2 off my meal....ok. I get home hungry and slightly annoyed and the smoothies were weird tasting. They tasted very frothy and not thick. Both burgers were completely flavorless and dried out. The bread was 2xs more than the meat and was also dry. The sweet potato fries were oily and stringy. These people can't get pocket change out of me. This place is nasty and slow.

I saw one person spend 21 dollars on two drinks that is crazy! On top of that I saw one of the people working there put some syrup into my smoothie and they are so stingy on the products. The owner is too personal and they whole feel is so weird. Make your own smoothies at home for these prices. Shit -- for 5 dollars I could get a pineapple and a coconut and honey and make my own pina colada rather then the chemical syrup filled stuff they serve here. I had a good laugh when the owner literally took people from outside begging them to buy the drinks. *EDIT!* So I have come to find out, the waffles cost 3 dollars and they add a dollar for cinnamon and that the red velvet pancakes aren`t even red velvet. Its food coloring. These people aren`t discrete when putting this stuff in. I see why they tell you to go sit down when they start making your stuff they don`t want you to watch them put food coloring in and call it a red velvet. I`ll be returning after gym to find out more about this place. I haven't tried the juices yet but I would hate to find out they are putting bottled juice in with the stuff they juice to be cheap."

Enter on the garden level and take a seat at the bar, or allow the host to set you up with a table. There's also an upstairs area, though this space was closed when I first visited a couple weeks ago. The menu has a variety of mouthwatering fare, both Latin-inspired and American (old and new). There are some fusion-y items that are a little unexpected: the po boy and jambalaya occupy menu space opposite pho and a banh mi. I applaud the ambition. Independent restaurants with a laidback vibe are what this neighborhood needs, not more fast casual chains. If you want to shake things up while having a good time, check out Carla.

Entire menu as well is worth exploring. Get the shrimp and pulled pork tacos as well as the guac. My favorite drink was the pineapple basil smash. But the hibiscus margarita was amazing as well. It's kind of styled like a diner but with an eclectic menu ranging from po boys to pho to spring rolls, burgers and sandwiches, wings, tacos, jambalaya. All over the place but in a good way. Only downside I guess would be the prices. Around $14-15 for a cocktail and most of the entrees and apps were expensive. $11-15 for 2 tacos which they were well done but $5-6 a taco is a bit steep for me and these were tiny. My friend was joking this should be our new hang out spot in the city and I was like I don't make that kind of money. Next time we're going to a dive bar. Unsure if they sell wine and beer here but I'd be tempted to come back. They have also a really fun decked out 50's style aluminum looking bus parked out front I'm assuming for outdoor dining."

I found it hard to put into words how horrible the hostess and a few other staff were to us. Pride, a day of love. A day where we show compassion and respect for human beings. On this day your hostess was so rude and disrespectful. Had she approached us with even the smallest ounce of respect we might have been more accommodating. But she chose to be nasty, and roped in a few others. including a young man who literally told us to get the fuck out of there. We were outside of the establishment, enjoying the day. I certainly do not want anyone to lose their jobs over this but perhaps a training in compassion and customer service might help them to interact with people on a more positive level.  I will never eat at your restaurant again and have advised my friends to avoid your establishment as well. We have decided we prefer to spend our money in places where we are treated with dignity and respect."

My husband and I have dined here many times pre-Covid and you could sit at the bar without ordering food. We arrived at Cafe Cluny and said we wanted to sit at the bar and order drinks with a party of four. The hostess and another waiter told us ok but needed to check that the bar was ready for customers given the time of day. Totally fine. The staff was more than accommodating and helpful. As we were waiting, the manager came up to us and said in a very attacking voice that we needed to order to order food. NYC dropped this requirement a few days ago. When I questioned, he said, ""we are a restaurant, not a bar"". Although we have ordered just drinks here many times. We still decided to sit at the bar and when the manager brought the menus over my friend was in the bathroom. We told the manager that we needed four menus and he told us ""we don't hold chairs here"". We told 3 different employees, including him that it was a party of 4 at the door. Granted we were the first people since they had just ""opened"" the bar, and 2 other employees saw all 4 of us. The manager's tone was very rude and I would not put up with his final words regarding holding chairs, so the four of us left.Not sure why we were treated this way; however, I plan on letting anyone I know not to dine at Cafe Cluny's.Good luck to you and your business!"

Y'all - I don't like chicken wings, don't love buffalo sauce, and don't always like blue cheese and let me tell you THESE BUFFALO CHICKEN DUMPLINGS ARE THE BEST. We were losing our damn minds -- not one fancy French thing about them & WHO CARES. Next time we go back we vowed to just get 4 bowls of these & champagne & live our life right.

There are heated tents for outdoor dining and the set up was lovely with flowers, as well as paper menus on the silver tables.I was torn between the Duck Confit Cassoulet and the Pappardelle with Duck Bolognese, but finally decided on the Cassoulet, which consisted of house made duck sausage, cranberry beans, smoked bacon broth, escarole, and pearl onions. This was deliciously made, with a generous piece of duck in the center. The duck was wonderfully seasoned, quite tender, and satisfyingly juicy. The meat simply fell off the bone, and that broth was bursting with flavor. All the other components, from the duck sausage, to the beans, to the onion, were also expertly cooked. Everything came together to create a tasty dish. I also got the try the Parmesan Fries, which were perfectly crispy with tons of yummy shaved Parmesan on top. For dessert, I was delighted to find Sticky Toffee Pudding on the menu, a traditionally British dessert that is one of my favorites of all time. The Sticky Toffee Pudding was covered with sweet, sticky butterscotch, sprinkled with powdered sugar, with rich, creamy smooth whipped cream on the side. The pudding was absolutely mouthwatering, and just the right amount of moistness mixed with spongy chewiness, becoming crumbly when chewing. The butterscotch sauce and whipped cream added to the decadence and paired together well.Service was great throughout. My friend and I really enjoyed our time dining at this spot."

For covid precautions- tables were separate by dividers, temperature checks to use the bathroom indoors, staff were wearing masks.I got the pera y Romero, and it was refreshing! This was a tequila drink and it had hints of rosemary and pear. I thought the food options for brunch were pretty standard. I wasn't sure if it was because I was only looking at the vegetarian options but even my friends who eat meat also thought the same. I got the three egg omelette (egg white) with vegetables. It was filling but nothing too special. I did really love the location, and the service was also great! If you are looking for an ordinary brunch spot, this is definitely for you."

The entrees didn't stand out to me they were all ok but nothing special. For dessert we ordered the chocolate chip cookie and the ice cream sandwich. Both were delicious."

I go minimum once a week!  When I visit a friend Downtown  I order from Cafe Cluny   - a sister restaurant.  Last night there was a problem with the delivery service.  My friend was upset and called the restaurant.  Not only were they lovely they addressed and solved the issue with dignity and aplomb.  They were just so classyAs always the food at any of the three Odeon- restaurants was nothing short of incredible.   The steak- I accidentally ordered the 4ounce size and my friend could have eaten the bigger as it was flavorful tender and perfect.  The Tuna burger exceeded expectations and the Trout was presented beautifully and was fresh and  delicious. Even though there was a delivery issue we managed to . Reheat without ruining the flavors.  To top it off sharing a vanilla chocolate cake ice cream sandwich was the quintessential end to an amazing dinner. My friend was truly upset about the delivery issue but that dissipated when he consumed his dinner coupled with the  sensitive  handling of his issue. If you are lucky enough to have one of these establishments in the Odeon group near you and want a special culinary experience -- go!!!

Navona in Rome.The food is high quality and delicious. It offers vegetarian options and very tasty appetizers - we ordered the buffalo chicken gyoza which had perfect texture and drenched in blue cheese sauce. Also ordered the purple sticky rice bowl - containing avocado, kale, shiitake mushrooms, broccoli rabe, and sriracha broth offering a high protein, fulfilling entree. Dessert was finished off with fried dough and adequately heated molten chocolate cake, drizzled in chocolate sauce. It was all extremely tasty...But my one gripe about the restaurant was it's lack of variety especially for brunch. Besides several egg-based dishes, there aren't many vegetarian dishes. The portion sizes are also a bit smaller than expected for their prices (~ $30 for seafood) but then again, that's NYC for ya! Overall, an enjoyable place to sit outside with friends for a weekend brunch. Is it truly unique? I'm not convinced.."

After the cashier took my order, I said, ""you know, it's none of my business, but there's a dead guy in that booth over there."" She stared at me blankly and handed me my receipt.As I waited for my order, I wandered over to the dead man's booth and confirmed that he was indeed a cold, lifeless body. I decided to give him a name: Gene. Gene's final meal was spread out over the table in front of him: medium fries, a soda, ten piece McNuggets and barbecue sauce. I went back to the counter to pick up my meal. ""You want barbecue sauce?"" I paused. ""No thanks,"" I said. ""Better go with the honey mustard.""I sat down at an empty table and ate my meal. The bright, fluorescent lighting gave the place a sterile, industrial feel. A top 40 playlist crooned over the loudspeaker. After a few minutes, Gene's festering corpse fell from its upright position and collapsed into booth next to him. It was a fairly busy night, and I counted about a dozen people who came and went as and ate my nuggets. I had one left when a young woman entered. She walked past Gene's body, and did a double take. A look of confusion swept across her face. She scanned the room nervously, and we locked eyes. For a brief second, we became members of a dark conspiracy. In the other's eyes, we gazed into the grey abyss of existence. She nodded silently. I picked up my tray, and left the McDonald's. Overall, pretty standard McDonald's. Clean bathrooms.

Only downside today was the sabayon, felt more like a gelato and less mike the custardy delight I was expecting.A downside is that the place doesn't take reservation and there usually is a line so definitely if you live in the neighborhood make sure to drop by 1 hr in advance to put you are on the list."

Seldom do you find an institution as welcoming, professional and consistently excellent as Noodle Pudding. I bring all my friends her and they, in turn, wind up bringing theirs which means if you do t turn up at the door at the stroke of 5, you may be left waiting for a table. This place is consistently good ergo it is consistently PACKED.The menu rotates from season to season, featuring the freshest local ingredient prepared with the kind of grace and simplicity Noodle Pudding is known for. We start things off with a seasonal salad which can feature anything from shaved Parmesan to golden beets, lightly dressed. Next, I recommend their fried whiting appetizer-- two golden crisp fish served with salt and lemon, soft enough to consume the entire fellow, head and all.  They are known for their soft baked bread, sprinkled with sea salt and served with herbed garlic oil for dipping. The pasta is always a winner. We love their fresh linguini with cherry tomatoes and clams but if you crave something heavier, their handmade papadelle ragu never leaves one wanting. I love Noodle Pudding for their seafood. Their grilled salmon with a side of braised escarole and white bean was once a spring favorite but these days you're more likely to find flounder grilled and served with olive oil and lemon. Perfection. Don't neglect dessert. Can never go wrong with their simple panna cotta and fresh fruit over cappuccino.Don't walk. Run to Noodle Pudding for a dinner you'll keep coming back to."

I just had finished getting some going away party drinks with some friends and we decided to get mcdonalds because we were hungry. We tried to get in, but were locked out, by a plastic bag tied around the door handles, and they insisted they were closed. About 10 people were inside sitting down, and a few others were waiting for food., getting their drinks from the machine. Again as I mentioned, this store is open 24 HOURS. And even if the hours changed and they weren't updated online, this is absolutely no way to close a store. Me along with other patrons discussed how this wasnt legal, and it then lead to the one of the employees physically pushing us out and barricading the door. We then decided it wasnt worth it, and went home.As big a company as you are, especially with all the renovations and changes, I expect you to be on top of your franchisees to properly train the employees.

For $50 you get open bar and BBQ from 1pm to 7pm. Sounded like a good deal. The beer selection was limited. No IPA's. The tap beer I selected tasted skunky & was flat. Bad way to start. I switched to bottled beer. Now for the food... a big, dirty looking, hairy toothless guy was manning a big brick bbq in the yard (The same bbq that people were throwing cigarettes into not 5 minutes before he started cooking). He was throwing on chicken & ribs that appeared to pre-cooked, days old pieces of meat of which he slathered with bbq sauce with a dirty brush. He also cooked some burgers and dogs. The food was put out on a table where anyone and everyone could handle it. People were picking up items with their bare hands. Disgusting! I was starving so I had a hot dog and a miniature lobster tail (yes he put out lobsters). Big mistake!!! Later that night I became terribly ill. Fever, vomiting uncontrollably and some other things... My wife took me to the emergency room. I was diagnosed with dysentery. Never felt worse in my life. Took me a few days to recover. Lost 8 pounds which was nice, but I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy!  There's no way that the board of health would allow this type of buffet. The amount of bacteria that must build up on the meat while sitting there at room temp must be off the charts! Not to mention all the mishandling of the food and the dirty man who was grilling it, which I later found out was the owner!! No one watches the food as it sits on the buffet table, which is right outside the door of the filthy urine stinking bathroom, so anyone can mess with it at any time. The Board of Health needs to examine this place ASAP. There's no grade posted on the window up front. I have to believe that if this buffet was reviewed the place would not receive a passing grade.

I wouldn't say everyone behind the counter is bubbly, but they've been polite so far.The slices here may seem a bit pricer compared to other nearby locations but it's absolutely worth it. It's the right size and it holds together. My favorite is the white pizza, though it can feel super heavy around the end.The interior is clean, and while there were always customers there pre-pandemic, I've always been able to find seats with friends.On the other hand, I do wish the ordering/paying process was more organized. When there's multiple customers, it can get confusing where to wait, and I've had instances where rude customers would intentionally cut in line to pay with no interference from the cashier."

This hidden crown jewel is located in Astoria, although there are several chains across Queens, which produce similar superior quality cuisine.I have lived in NYC for over 30 years, and nothing has come close to good or on par with Rosa's. Their pizza is just absolutely delicious - with a perfect balance of both cheese and sauce along with an enriched pizza bread that will leave you coming back for more than one slice! Prices are reasonable, but worth noting that all of their price points are based on cash payments. Be prepared to pay tax and an additional fee if you use a credit card.Aside from an excellent cheese slice, I also enjoy their Chicken Caesar pizza, and their spaghetti with chicken, broccoli, garlic and oil.Definitely worth a visit if you're looking for some awesome NYC style pizza and Italian food."

I waned something with mango, so after confirming this does have mango (even though the description doesn't say it does), I order this. As I stood there waiting for the receipt, the woman started talking to an employee who was off duty, crumpled up my receipt and threw it out in front of me and didn't tell me how I would know my smoothie was ready. I sat down. It appeared shortly after with no call. Then, I get the smoothie, and there is shredded coconut on top instead of chia (which was a bummer) and it tasted like there are pieces of sawdust in it.

Temple Court is located inside the Beekman Hotel and I highly recommend that you try this restaurant out! It's a totally different experience - Once you go inside, it will immediately take you to a different time where craftsmanship and intricate detailing flourished. The place had this very intimate and quiet atmosphere, which complemented the old world feel reflected on the architectural envelope as well as the furniture, decor and lighting. The paintings on the walls felt like they were real and looked SO amazing! The centerpiece was this grand atrium and you definitely have to see it in person to really appreciate its charm. These pictures do not at all justify how beautiful it is. Food was good, I had the eggs benedict with salmon. The eggs were runny just the way i like them and the salmon was great. Pricing was a bit expensive for the food but I think it was also based on the location. Overall, I would totally come back here and experience the Beekman charm all over again!"

1182,2n01u4yKfIrWuOzRVvIZmw,3/26/2022,4 star rating,"I have to start this review with a disclaimer:  I have thoroughly enjoyed every dining experience at Tom Colicchio's restaurant, Craft.  So this being another Colicchio enterprise, I had high expectations.  Thankfully, I was not disappointed. The entrance to Temple Court in the Beekman hotel is a vast but cozy lounge.  The dark green walls, opulent sofas, plush Persian rugs, and multiple grand floors over head remind me of mash-up between an Ivy tower library and Hogwart's.  Through this grand entrance is the main dining room.  It's a bit dim due to the deep burgundy brick walls, aged, exposed pipes and dark wood, but is lit by large antique chandeliers that highlight the enormous stained glass windows, filling up entire walls.  The room almost feels sacred (perhaps, hence the name, ""Temple""), and yet very elegant. On to the food!  The amuse bouche was white fish with avocado that was both bright and acidic, yet creamy due to the avocado, creating a smooth mouth feel.  Great way to start.  For an appetizer we had the big eye tuna tartare with a light soy sauce, celery shavings and ginger.  The tuna was very lightly seared and so fresh you'd think it would jump out of your mouth!   We also had an extremely savory chestnut agnolotti.  These wonderful parcels of delightfulness from heaven consisted of fresh pasta filled with rich butternut squash and black chestnuts, graced with black truffle shavings and light truffle oil.  Let the temple say, amen!  I had the lamb for my main entrée.  It was tender, but a touch tart which was different for me.  It was served with beans and was overall a very nice, hearty dish.  I finished with a selection of three artisanal cheeses for desert: a pasteurized sheep cheese, a raw goat cheese and a raw cow cheese.   All were delicious. I enjoyed my dining experience at Temple Court and would gladly return."
1183,2n01u4yKfIrWuOzRVvIZmw,2/5/2023,5 star rating,"A perfect restaurant week deal. For the price, the value of the fine dining experience was unparalleled. The dishes were refined and filling, with options that crossed many flavor profiles.To start, a sweet potato soup was served alongside a salted dinner roll and an indulgent, creamy butter. The soup had a strong vegetal flavor that felt true to the sweet potato. The salt level of the dish, alongside the addition of the olive oil, amplified the natural sweetness of the vegetable without drawing attention away from it. The waiter indicated that there were ground spices in the dish, but I couldn't pick out any of the flavors. In any case, they weren't missed. The dinner roll had a perfectly browned outside crust, with a good, tight crumb structure that still allowed it to feel light. This was the preamble to the solid mussel dish. Served in a yellow mustard crème fraîche alongside grilled slices of bread, the ensemble felt rustic and loving. It was a heavy dish and didn't hold back on that intention, but even in this format, the mussel's texture and flavor amplified it. The sauce packed a punch of mustard. The main, a pork chop, sage, apple, and sauerkraut joined sweet, savory, and sour beautifully. Although it worked for me, all three flavors were intensely felt and would be too dramatic to be considered a crowd-pleaser. The pork was presented atop a braised sauerkraut and dotted with the apple slices. My only complaint was that there was too much sauerkraut for the dish: rather than working as a side, it seemed it was trying to take some of the spotlight. The sage was a workhorse in this dish, dry and whole-leafed so that the herb disintegrated on the tongue and joined with the sauce.The lemon meringue, however, lacked the harmony found in the other dishes. It was simply too sour. It was served in a pomegranate sauce, and with blood oranges, it created a feedback loop of sourness that overwhelmed the fruits' other characteristics. There was no little reprise from its acidity. Although still satisfying when eaten as a bite or two, the dish needed a balance that wasn't there.Overall, I would happily return to the restaurant. The staff was accommodating and respectful, and the European literary aesthetic was exciting."

As part of the trio starter, we got avocado toast with pine nuts, the flavor was outstanding, the bread tho, the edges were so hard that i was afraid to chip a tooth, uhm it wasn't the right crust for this starter, i even saw other people scraping the avocado off, since chewing it was at your own risk, lol. our steak was very tasty and very soft, not the right temperature for my daughter tho so i helped her out. The highlight of the meal was definitely dessert, we had lemon rhubarb tarte with thyme ice cream, wow! that was outstanding, i ordered a fresh cup of coffee to go with my dessert but i wasn't surprised it came after i was done, uhm yeah sounds about right, they didn't seem to care very much about service, it seemed like they just needed to fill out the space, for example, they placed 6 people on the next table as mine which was a table for 5, when the extra person was placed, he blocked me in, i didn't even have space to exit!  they wasn't mindful of how they blocked me ‍.I had to push the table my self and slide around the table, while wearing my fancy dress to exit, i was afraid i was going to tip over the table, or rip the table cloth off, which honestly would have been comical , the waiters were too busy standing on the side to care about what was happening.  it really was a sad experience, i don't usually do reviews or say bad things about businesses but this was truly over the top and not in a good way, it's very pricey and for no reason, great food is found in many places, great food and outstanding service that's a gem, this place was just one more place, overpriced and with rude people."

The reason why it didn't taste good in my first review is because it's supposed to be served WARMED! So I ate it wrong and didn't warm it when I took it home. When served correctly, This pie is an absolute work of art and tastes like it was made by God. It literally is a MUD pie and it's so gooey and rich. My partner and I could not believe it was the same thing we ordered last time! We also had the apple crumble and was really impressed with the texture and flavor of it. After trying the Mississippi mud pie warmed with an ice cream a La mode, I couldn't imagine a more delightful pie but then I tried the triple berry pie and was blown away. Service was excellent - the hostess was so warm, welcoming, and the servers all seemed excited to be there. There was also a Dj there that had the best taste in music! Not overwhelming EDM stuff like most Djs and a bit of the best old classics with his own spin on it. It really added to the ambiance and emphasized the warm environment of this place. Perfect for any event - date nights, family nights, small group hangouts. I met the owner personally to follow up with my experience and it really goes to show how much they care about the experience of their customers. Food, experience, and ambiance all 10/10. I'm so happy to have given Martha's bakery a second chance and the accolades are well deserved."

Don't go if you have a sweet tooth coz I guarantee you will leave with a bag full of calories. It's impossible to list down all the wide variety of desserts they carry. Cheese cakes, cannoli, tarts, pies, puddings, macarons, ice creams, cookies, pastries, cupcakes, you name it.Loved our warm delicious pecan pies paired with cold ice cream. Somehow the slight sourness of the strawberry ice cream balanced out the excess sweeteness of the pies. Each bite was heavenly and we were glad we ended our day with such delicious treats. Sinful yet satisfying."

Almost always the case when a bakery offers such a huge variety rather than more specialized in just a few things. The banana bread pudding and Apple Crumble were good quality, particularly impressed by texture and freshness of the apples. They weren't served warm enough for starters so the bread pudding didn't develop that amazing crunchy crust when freshly out of the oven. Either way, the place is cozy, the staff was nice and the coffee is good. I def get the appeal."

Some desserts are more creamy or decadent, so if you want something fluffy and light... ask your server for suggestions.We ordered the chocolate fudge cake and creme brûlée.

From a dry slice of chocolate cake to a flavorless rice pudding, nothing has stood out to me as anything I'd remotely consider paying full price for. The space is nice enough and the staff has been reliably friendly, but ultimately I just can't justify going back when there are so many other bakeries in the area that are much better.

In comparison to the cheesecake, it was easy to rate which I would knock a few stars for. It was enjoyable but I think now we know their strengths. Vibes: We went around 9pm and that was when it was transitioning in to the nighttime ambiance of the store which I loved. The lights dimmed, the music was boppin. I was expecting the shift but I was here for it. Its perfect for a night out. They have some extremely large picnic tables too in the center so they're great for groups!

Treat me like garnage and receive this well deserved review... I told you it was coming here it is.  Absolutely pathetic the way you talked to me you should be ashamed of losing a loyal customer because you wouldn't spend $1 to make someone whole again you won't see another cent out of me.  Pathetic stay in schoolSide note the nuggets tasted bad like really old oil, I know there was something very wrong because I know how they are supposed to taste...

I won't even get started on the rudeness of the young man who practically threw the bag at me.

1239,0Ao9422D82WgsiUbr_t_Qg,2/24/2018,1 star rating,"OMG! This business is a joke! I second all of the 1 and 2 star reviews for this Mcdonald's! There is a reason this place only has 2 1/2 stars out of 5. I'm giving this place one star, because you can't even leave a review without giving a place at least one star. The service here is terrible, the employees are rude, obnoxious and dismissive. There has not been one time that I have gone to this location and they have forgotten something off my order. Not only that, I downloaded the app to place an order, so it could be ready by the time my boyfriend got there to pick it up. I couldn't go myself because I was feeling really ill and didn't feel well enough to go there. He gets there with my confirmation number and they told him, that I had to physically be there to pick because they would not start to make the order until my wifi (which I have zero wifi on the device I was using, unless I am connected to my home wifi), shows that I am close enough to the location, for them to even start making my order. So exactly what is the point of the app? If I have no wifi, I have to wait until I am in the Mcdonald's or somewhere close enough that offers free wifi, connect to a wifi and then they can decide to start making your order. And! Not only that, if you physically cannot leave your house, you cannot have someone pick up the order for you. I had to leave my house, sick as a dog, pick up the order they already charged me for through the app...I am not lying when I tell you that by the time I went through the whole ordeal of ordering the damn food, picking it up, walking back home, on my way I ended up throwing up right in the Mcdonald's bag. Vomiting in the Mcdonald's bag until I made it to the bathroom in my apartment, as I'm hurling I realized they left something off my order! The app is a moot point, Mcdonald's hiring process is a joke, they can't even hire someone who knows how to do basic math. Ever ordered something that came out to say...$9.25...and you give them $10.25 so that you can get a dollar back? And the cashier looks at you like you have 8 heads because why are you giving them $10.25 when the $10.00 alone covers the cost of the order? And it's not like they have to do any damn math in their head! Just input the money you received into the register and it'll tell you how much you need to give back! But again, why am I shocked? It's McDonald's for crying out loud! What a joke. I just don't get it. And if that's not enough...the employees are crying over how much minimum wage is, raise it to $15 you say? FOH! Go back to school and request a refund because clearly someone didn't learn you right (that's McDonald's talk for you). Please read reviews before you even think of ordering from this place."

Their green tea mochi is perfectly balanced, you can taste the green tea, coconut, and red bean. It's not too sweet so you can eat a lot. AND it's only $1! Most of their goods are less than $2.There were two Cantonese ladies working when I went. They were so friendly and they seemed to enjoy helping me pick what desserts to buy haha.I highly recommend this place if you want to show off your knowledge of hole in the wall joints.

I'm relatively new to the milk tea world (and so can't really compare), but this tea was delicious. It tasted sort of like one of those almond cookies that come after meals in some Chinese restaurants. It was lightly sweet and only lightly almond and very hot - a great breakfast option! They have lots of other milk/bubble tea options for folks to try.They have a lot of buns in a grab and go style case near the door, as well as a refrigerated case of desserts. I didn't realize until I went to check out, but they also had a heated stash of buns behind the counter that you could ask for. I tried a couple buns and my favorite was the sweet red bean one. It had a lot of flavors and textures going on in a way that really worked for me. The walnut milk bun was fine but less exciting - more of just a roll with walnut on it. I'd definitely recommend getting a couple different kinds to try, especially if you're unfamiliar with Chinese bakeries. You never know which one you'll love!"

After stumbling upon this place on my way back to the subway station one day, I quickly discovered a new must-try in Chinatown and have been back here several times since.One of my favorite items is the egg tart, which is sold at a price of 2 for $1.50, already better than most other locations in the area selling for $1 each. I normally would've passed on them but the nice lady working the counter had just told me that they were fresh and had just came out the oven. The crust is perfectly buttery and flaky, yet strong enough to hold the plentiful egg filling. The filling is done just right in terms of texture and flavor; soft yet not dripping and the perfect blend of sweet and savory without being overly sweet. I would say the egg tarts are a must, especially when fresh.The red bean pancake is also very good for those who prefer their Chinese baked good not too sweet like myself. The outer crust is flaky and flavorful and the pancake itself is packed full of semi-sweet red bean paste. Usually the red bean pancakes that I am accustomed to do not have sesame seeds but the one's here have them all over the top which was a nice change.The packaged breads are rolls that I tried were all pretty good as well, nothing extremely spectacular but enjoyable. I also got to try the mango mochi and matcha mochi, both of which were also pretty good. The mochi is coated in coconut flakes which adds a nice contrasting crunchy texture to the soft and glutinous dough ball.The food and service here are both extremely good. I would recommend trying this place out. The have many different types of baked goods and drinks at a very reasonable price range."

The filling is done just right in terms of texture and flavor; soft yet not dripping and the perfect blend of sweet and savory without being overly sweet. I would say the egg tarts are a must, especially when fresh.The red bean pancake is also very good for those who prefer their Chinese baked good not too sweet like myself. The outer crust is flaky and flavorful and the pancake itself is packed full of semi-sweet red bean paste. Usually the red bean pancakes that I am accustomed to do not have sesame seeds but the one's here have them all over the top which was a nice change.The packaged breads are rolls that I tried were all pretty good as well, nothing extremely spectacular but enjoyable. I also got to try the mango mochi and matcha mochi, both of which were also pretty good. The mochi is coated in coconut flakes which adds a nice contrasting crunchy texture to the soft and glutinous dough ball.The food and service here are both extremely good. I would recommend trying this place out. The have many different types of baked goods and drinks at a very reasonable price range."

We had high hopes for it but unfortunately the experience was a bit underwhelming. Appetizers were the best part of our experience. We ordered the pork buns, Kani salad and rock shrimp which were all delicious, however the sushi was very average. In fact after eating the tuna roll, my friend felt sick and said that it didn't seem like it was fresh and had a stomach ache. Overall was okay. Service was average and their staff was not friendly."

Unfortunately it did not rate a five on taste.   My first concern was how fast the food came out. The chicken was obviously precooked and needed more teriyaki sauce to develop a flavor. It should be noted this place does an amazing take out business.

This place came up on yelp and we ordered through grub hub. Prices were amazing and food looked good. Said 20-30 mins delivery when everywhere else was 45+ mins. They were here in, I shit you not, like 15 mins tops. Ordered: chicken tereyaki bento box with gyoza, white rice, and Philadelphia roll. (& an extra order of gyoza cause Momma love her some gyoza and baby was in stern agreement)  NOMZ - all delicious. Great service. Great food. Speedy af. Great prices. Winning."

The spicy scallop rolls were overcooked, and since they were diced it was hard to taste the scallop flavor. The snowcrab avocado tasted clean and had good texture.We also ordered the salmon teriyaki bento with side salad and crazy roll. It came with rice and orange slices. The lunch price was extremely affordable for the portion size. The salmon piece was thin and slightly overcooked, and the teriyaki sauce was a little salty. The crazy roll was large, and the salad was a standard green mix with house dressing. I would order the bento again, but with a different protein."

I keep saying to myself that I am going to try a new flavor but I keep going to my 2 favs: vanilla chip and chocolate peanut butter. Both of these are from the cream ices list. More reasons why I love Ralph's:*Several different size options*Many flavor options*They serve you very quickly*Better alternative to eating ice cream in terms of fat and calories*Very friendly staffThis location in particular has a couple of benches outside if you want to sit there and enjoy your summer treat!

During the summer, I probably frequent Ralph's at least once a week, sometimes more. One of my favorite flavors here has to be the peanut butter cookie dough. Oh. My. God. Amazing. Such a true peanut butter flavor and the chunks of peanut butter cookie dough are incredible. This flavor might be better than many of life's delicacies. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I also really like the plain old chocolate, graham cracker, vanilla fudge brownie, cookie dough, and chocolate Oreo. They're all so creamy and flavorful and never ""icy""...if that makes sense.

But I hate when businesses reflect incorrect information. Closing up shop earlier than advertised is a huge inconvenience. We trust the Store Hours you're posting.

Depending on who's working the wok, determines the quality of food you'll receive, i.e. gamy, thin cut meat or thick, hearty pieces of meat; oily rice or  perfectly seasoned rice, etc. The sitting area is clean. Their delivery turnaround has gotten very slow - went from 20min to 1hr - so it's best to call it in b/c it's usually ready in 10-15min."

They use (surprisingly abundant) fresh veggies, their food isn't swimming in greasy sauce, and when you order chicken or beef dishes the meat they use appears to be of decent quality. Delivery and counter service reliable, quick, and polite. Of the 5+ hole-in-the-wall Chinese joints in the immediate vicinity, Teng Dragon is by far the best. Only complaint so far is the egg rolls - barely edible in my opinion, though the same can be said for practically all such take-out joints. Steamed or fried dumplings are a much better choice here as appetizer."

The menu had something for everyone and an excellent variety for meat eaters, pescatarians, vegetarians and the like. Our waiter made some very helpful recommendations based on our preferences, and was so friendly. Between the table we ordered the lamb, the seafood stew, the duck, and the branzino special. Everything was very tasty. Only suggestion would be to have some additional sauce to complement the meats and perhaps opt to sauté or roast the vegetable sides as they didn't add much to the dish...except for the cheese mashed potatoes which were just WOW!! We were personally thanked by the owner at the end of the meal which was such a nice touch. Cannot wait to go back and try more of the food options!"

The food is mostly French fusion, yet there is enough international selection to keep most people happy. I started with a prosecco based drink which was crisp and tangy perfect for summer. The French onion soup is delicious as it should be in every French restaurant. I tried the chicken tagine and the seafood soup and both were flavorful and came as generous potions. The desserts were yummy especially the bread pudding with ice cream. The pricing is fair, yes, Pascalou makes it is possible to have a reasonably priced meal in the Upper East Side.

A cursory search brought up this cute little French restaurant with outdoor seating - I'd say there were about 10 or so tables, with about 2 larger ones under a canopy for bigger parties. All tables were appropriately spaced away from each other. We made reservations via Yelp, but got there a little bit earlier and were seated immediately. We started off with a 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon ($11/glass). A little pricey, but very good! For my dinner I chose the duck confit, as that appears to be a hit - it did not disappoint. The skin on outside was a liiiittttlle overcooked, but the sauce was flavorful and the inside was still moist and fell off the bone. My friend got the chicken/lamb tagine, which was very flavorful, but unfortunately, she does not eat lamb. The staff was quick to help her out and substituted it with a lovely Nicoise salad. By the way, portion sizes are very generous!Staff was very professional and helped us out with the menu. All the staff was appropriately masked. Excited to come back another again!"

The Rib Eye Minute Steak Pita was absolutely delicious and the steak was well-seasoned. The Roast Beef Pita was a bit disappointing mainly because of how salty the roast beef was.

Despite that fact, the area was cleaned and maintained well. I was greeted by a nice lady who took my order of meatloaf and two sides of creamed spinach and mac n' cheese. I feel as if she was rather new because I was given really small portions. When I started eating the food, the meatloaf was a little dry and the creamed spinach tasted sour. I quickly asked someone who looked to be the manager and he apologized, proceeding to ask me if I wanted another side (green beans). The green beans were a bit mushy and not that great tasting either. Overall, I think the food was cold and quality was below my standards.

I believe that all anyone really wants in this life is to sit in peace and eat a sandwich.'And that's exactly what I did at Court Street Grocers. As a mostly vegetarian and sometimes pescetarian, I was delighted at the multiple delicious sandwich options that awaited me here. Most shops will concede a wilted caprese sandwich or a poorly conceived portabello mushroom cap sandwich or sometimes if you're lucky, a deep-fried falafel sandwich. Not at Corner Street. Their vegetarian sandwiches are creative, loaded down with vegetables, mind-blowingly delicious, and not reliant on faux meats.I got the vegitalian combo and ate the first half for lunch and wolfed down the other half for dinner. Not sure why other reviewers think their sandwiches are small...I think they're a solid deal for the price. Anyway, back to my new food obsession, the vegitalian sandwich. It's sweet and salty and cheesy and sour flavors in every single freaking bite. The bread was soft but a little crunchy on the outside. The yams were cooked perfectly. The sandwich was well assembled and did not fall apart upon eating. The sandwich tasted equally delicious just after being made and later after being refrigerated. It is easily the best sandwich I've ever tasted in my 13 years of being a vegetarian."

Walked it back to the office and let me tell you this was sandwich nirvana. First off the bread is amazing, crunchy and fresh despite the humidity we had been having, the turkey is not the typical cold cut style turkey but chunks of carved turkey, the provolone which too often has no taste was the real sharp deal,the broccoli rabe was garlicky and laced with red pepper flakes, the sriracha honey was sweet and spicy as you would expect. The harmony of these flavors, sweet, spicy,salty,earthy was like a symphony! Im gonna go ahead and say it that this is the best sandwich I have had this year.     As fo the price that people seem to gripe over it was 9.00, a premium Subway sandwich is about a dollar cheaper, can you compare the two? I put this place up there with Defontes based on that one sandwich. Cant wait to try the sweet potato and beet one"

Their bread is great, the pairings they make on the sandwiches are so flavorful they brighten up a crappy day.  My personal fav is the piglet. Truly genuine flavors that come together perfectly. They also use a lot of farm fresh seasonal products so the menu changes with the season."
1343,25_49FKGg8W7na2kcyCd3g,8/15/2017,4 star rating,They have a great selection of sandwiches and easy going friendly staff. There are maybe 6 seats inside and a few outside so plan to eat    alfresco just in case.  We like to car picnic.  We think their prices are fair for upscale sandwiches.   It is so good I plan to work through every sandwich on their menu.  So far it was all great.  I think they use bread from Caputo's bakery.  If you don't know them it may be worth the trip down Court st.  They are one of my favorite bakeries and their bread does take these sandwiches to a totally higher level.  Oh a cheese only sandwich isn't on the menu but they'll make one.  Which is good for kids with less adventurous taste buds.
1344,25_49FKGg8W7na2kcyCd3g,1/31/2018,5 star rating,I would eat here every day except that I don't live in Brooklyn and that might be a little unhealthy.  Instead Ineat one every three months when I visit Red Hook.  I love to get their sandwiches in the morning or in the afternoon and take them down to the water and eat them with the care of a new lover.  The bread is chewy and so so fresh made but not too thick or dominating.  The ingredients are in perfect order and quantity.  YUM
1345,25_49FKGg8W7na2kcyCd3g,6/20/2015,5 star rating,"Okay so I have to start by saying that the first few times I tried Court Street Grocers right after they opened years ago, the portions were comically small.  The turkey sandwich was literally one tiny strip of chicken on wonder bread.  As a result I wrote them off along with the subsequent sub shop in Red Hook.  With great options like HBH nearby I never thought about them again.  Fast forward a few years and I found myself hunger for a turkey sandwich so decided to give them another try today.   As it turned out the Court street location was sold out of turkey and roast beef so we called the red hook location.  Turned out they had both and their prices are actually a few dollars cheaper. When I got there I realized this used to be the location of our favorite Mexican joint, Viva (oh how I miss their avocado fries and salsa). We always loved this out of the way location.  Court street made the tiny shop look great and the staff was super friendly.  We got the $9 Droopy (roast beef with horseradish sauce and fried onions on Caputos hero).  The roast beef was cooked to perfection and incredibly tender and easy to eat with no fat or mystery bits.  Just a really solid and huge sandwich (literally 3 times what they used to give you).  We also got the $8 turkey sandwich with butter pickles arugula and red onions).  It was pure perfection. Really great flavor profile and huge.  Both sandwiches are substantial but don't feel heavy or overwhelming.  They are just really well balanced sandwiches. The experience turned around my whole opinion of the company.  In fact think I may be going again tomorrow."

You must try this sandwich. One of the best vegetable sandwiches I have ever had.Update: I went back the next week, as soon as I was able to do so. I now dream about this sandwich. Beets flying overhead, hero bread as clouds and one hungry person laying down, hoping for rain."

I'll get a small order of stewed chicken with white rice for my son. The food is always hot, you get a choice of sauces and the specials are listed on the wall. They should get a better system when calling out your order when it's ready. People are usually just standing around waiting and guessing if that's their order being bagged up. The woman/women that take orders depending on the day needs an extreme attitude adjustment. I hate going into an establishment and you make it seem as if your doing me a favor by taking my order. The money I'm spending here I could've gone to the supermarket and made my food, but I'm lazy. The prices do seem to escalate quickly. You can easily rack up a $20 for 2 people real quick."

When I come out, they take pics again. I confront them and they threaten us with a hand motion across the throat. I called the police.

1452,TAm8Eauo0NQNHpjOAWXo2A,5/27/2011,1 star rating,I was in hurry and decided pick up some Buffalo Wings to go. I've been passing by this place since I moved to Brooklyn. I decided that today was the day to try them out. Once you walk in the door you notice the the empty tables and the delivery bikes inside. It seems like no one really eats here cause the tables look like they haven't been cleaned in awhile. I got my order and paid around $5.25 for 10 pieces of Buffalo Wings. Once I got home I noticed that they only gave me 8 and a few of them had very little meat on them... Not happy.This will be the first and last time I go here.

1454,TAm8Eauo0NQNHpjOAWXo2A,1/12/2010,3 star rating,"First Review!One of my favorite places to go around the neighborhood, this place is not only cheap but the food is pretty good. I'm not sure whether Yummy Taco is a chain, but this store by far is one of better ones that I have tried. The menu is basically what you would find at any other tex mex place, hard tacos, soft tacos, burritos, fajitas, etc. But the main draw of this place is the ""mexican rice"" menu, and the ""jack and cheese"" menu. They are by far my favorites, great portions and tasty. As much as I would like to give this place a higher score, I feel as though the food quality has gone down over the years. As another yelper has stated the salsa is good, but it was much better and given out in much bigger portions in the past. The steak is also hit or miss, there have been times where I have gotten juicy and delicious steak and also times in which I had a tough time chewing it. Overall, if you're in the neighborhood, it's worth it to drop by. 3 stars!"

Sign me the hell up every second or third Saturday (or so it seems).Their salsa...I would probably run over someone, in front of their own momma, for more of it. Seriously. NEED MOAR.Best deal on the menu would have to be the $6 special which consists of 2 big tortillas, a ton of rice, beans, meat, and vegetables, AND a can of soda.The tacos are good, a little greasy/soggy but not overly so. The quesadillas are also made well, but a little small. I had the Mexican pizza once, it was alright but nothing special.The spicy cheese fries are also great!"

They will never get our business again, and we won't be recommending them to anyone.  We've always be patient when they were swamped, but when called out on their BS, they won't accept responsibility.  Yes, my husband said it's fing bs and this happens every fing time.  But the owners solution was to yell back and cancel our order.  NEVER AGAIN."

Look, I understand, wearing a mask is annoying but it's equally annoying that we have to deal with the threat of Covid-19! And to be fair, it's equally disgusting when you see the workers wearing their dirty masks, but the boss walks around, uncovered, pretending that this disease doesn't exist and worse, talking to his workers near exposed cold pizza! Now, if you don't see that as being ""Following safety protocol important,"" then you should remember that there are people in the world who do care about those things!

I took one bite and it was too spicy for me to eat. I saw one of our friends put a napkin up to his mouth and I could tell he was spitting out the pizza. His wife then apologized and said ""I don't blame him this is inedible"". My husband loves spicy foods and managed to eat one and a half pieces of pizza but agreed that it was overly spiced.We wound up throwing the rest of the pizza in the garbage because after one and a half slices even my husband said it was too spicy.

Unfortunately, my friend choose Murray Hill to meet and this actually became a genuine mission. As we kept walking east earnestly we came across a sign in the distance that said ""Cantina"". I had almost given up hope with Yelp guiding me to a diamond in the rough and this happened by accident. Drinks were medium priced but it was also the weekend and I wasn't expecting anything to be outstandingly cheap unless I wanted some asshole to pour green bud lite on my head in a frat bar. Beers were $6 or 7 and margaritas around $10. I believe on weekdays their happy hour runs until 7pm and their margaritas are half off. I liked the general ambiance of the place. It did look like a dark hole in the wall cantina with twinkly lights up. People were fairly chill and just eating their mexican treats and drinks. I went with a dark Mexican porter and it was delicious. My buddy went with drinking tequila on the rocks and coronas. I tried a piece of their chicken quesadilla and it was pretty good with a nice chipotle sauce slathered on top. Chips and salsa come complimentary. Yay, dinner. One of the more impressive parts of this bar is their tequila selection. We had shots of something amazing upon suggestion from our bartender who was fantastic and I hate myself for not remembering the name of it but it was a chipotle jalapeno tequila and it was so epic."

I came blind not knowing what to get. I opted for the mango pomelo because it was highly rated. It was highly refreshing and really delicious. I asked for half the sugar which is crazy because it was already sweet from everything that was added. There is only one size which is great for me since I can finish my drink. It was $8 for this drink so beware that this is NYC and bubble tea has gone to the moon. The only issue was that a lot of their drinks didn't have descriptions, making it hard to tell what was inside other than what is said in the title."

I reduced the sugar too so that when the creme brulee does eventually mix in, the drink isn't too sweet. However, I would go further to either 0 or 30% sugar (I did 50%). If you're big into sweet drinks though, I guess it doesn't hurt to keep it regular.When you walk in, there's a small preview of drinks on the wall. I thought that was the entire menu but it seems like the menu is much more vast - there's physical menus closer to the counter. Reference that when you're looking for a drink.Chewy boba. Not too strong in flavor but it is apparent. Overall, boba as a topping could be improved. Tea is nice and creamy and I liked seeing all the possible options. Definitely will be back to explore some other drinks."

Each wall is a different material aka different backgrounds for your hold-your-boba-up-against-the-wall-for-the-gram pics. I ordered the glutinous rice milk tea because there aren't many places that utilize this yummy topping. But I guess I also added boba too so I think I was eating my drink more than I was drinking it. The glutinous rice was a little underwhelming, mainly because it turned out to be just fat blobs of gluty rice that I had to REALLY suck for but I guess that gave my cheeks a workout?? The tea and boba itself was solid. Price-wise its definitely a lil more premium than your KFT's or gong cha but feels like standard NYC shop prices at around $5-6 without toppings for one size (comparing the regular milk tea drinks)."
1500,-4wt4Uau_zC5ilPMrIayxQ,9/18/2022,5 star rating,"Stumbled upon this boba shop and am happy to say I did :) We got the coco mango and peach jelly milk tea which were both amazing, not too sweet (the highest compliment), and you could taste the freshness of the fruit. A bit pricey but I would still 100% visit again to try all the other unique drinks on the menu and confirm its status as a top contender for my favorite boba place in the city!"
1501,-4wt4Uau_zC5ilPMrIayxQ,7/14/2022,5 star rating,"Delicious, fresh, well cooked boba. Got the Golden Passionfruit which included boba and lychee. Got regular ice and sweetness and it was perfect. Cool little cafe w good tunes too. No Wi-Fi but good people watching."
1502,-4wt4Uau_zC5ilPMrIayxQ,7/1/2022,4 star rating,"They are pretty good drinks. We weren't a fan of the Thai Brulee but enjoyed the lychee dragon fruit. They are one Size and you may or may not finish the drink but they are darn good! When we went it wasn't crowded so that's good. Nonetheless, we received our drinks quick. There are a few tables here to cool down and/or enjoy your drink(s)."
1503,-4wt4Uau_zC5ilPMrIayxQ,8/2/2022,5 star rating,"I'm from the Bay Area, so I'm really particular about my boba. But this boba was so yummy. I got the lychee drink and I loved it. Lychee is probs one of my favorite flavors so I had high expectations and it was definitely met. It was refreshing and we had such a fun time there, deff will keep going"
1504,-4wt4Uau_zC5ilPMrIayxQ,2/3/2022,5 star rating,"I've been here like 20 times at this point. It's a little expensive, but some of the best boba. My favorites are:The coco mango is amazing! LightThe creme brûlée is fantastic, with or without bobaThe pomelo drink is nice and light with fruit chunks. The mango milk is nice and tangy. All the slushees are very goodThe matcha strawberry is fantastic!The more plain teas in my opinion are not worth spending $7-8 on. I'd get a cooler drink, like some of the ones I listed."
1505,-4wt4Uau_zC5ilPMrIayxQ,8/28/2022,5 star rating,"Was walking downtown from Upper West Side and was really craving boba. Happened to find this place on Yelp and I'm so happy I did. I got the Coco Mango, and it was so delicious! The crystal boba had such a fun chewiness to it and the pudding was a yummy touch as well. The drink was really refreshing after a long walk and was also aesthetically gorgeous. I wish they had a location in a part of Manhattan that I visit more often, but maybe one day soon!"
1506,-4wt4Uau_zC5ilPMrIayxQ,9/11/2022,5 star rating,"Quite possibly the best bubble tea in NYC. I've been to most of the bubble tea spots in the city and Jooy (pronounced like ""Joy"") is at the top of my list. The fruit teas are incredible. The milk teas are spectacular AND they have non dairy options! And the cheese foam has the sweet, creamy taste of cheesecake that you'd expect. The boba has a good consistency without adding extra sweetness and the ""glass boba"" is a little like jello and a fun alternative for a fruit tea.I introduced a friend from Texas to Jooy and she said it was the best bubble tea she had ever had... then postponed leaving until they opened so she could get one more before leaving for home."

It was tiny, there must have been no more than 2 measly slices of turkey. I was still hungry after eating that tiny sandwich. Additionally, a large ice tea was over 7 bucks and didn't seem ""large"" at all. If I'm paying over 7 bucks for a large ice tea, I'm expecting something that actually feels large. This ice tea was the equivalent of a grande at starbucks, should have been closer to venti to warrant paying as much for an ice tea as I paid for the sandwich.  The ice tea and sandwich were good, but not nearly worth what I paid for it.  I understand times are tough now but I've ordered from several delis around the area and have never felt ripped off like this. Every deli I've ordered from has provided bigger sandwiches for the same price and have never had the nerve to charge over $5 for a drink.   Additionally, the delivery man wasn't wearing a mask. I also read a review that someone saw none of the employees were wearing masks.  This is pretty alarming and shows complete ignorance of what's going on with COVID. Every deliveryman I've encountered through seamless has always worn a mask but not this one."

Now, with this pandemic going on, that might not be what anyone wants to hear...but I'm not claustrophobic and enjoy a full train on my commute, so to speak. On this day, I was able to walk in and was greeted by one of three barista's ready to assist. There was a lady with a young girl at her side already with an order ahead of mine and I was in a really good mood. I asked the barista to charge her order together with mine and after getting my coffee I left without saying anything. I would have liked to have known her reaction, maybe one of the barista remembers me and can follow up on this review? None the less, coffee was awesome. I even went back later in the day to get a coffee for my commute home (NJ). I got the house special on both visits. They have some baked goods there that I definitely believe compliment the coffee or tea they offer...I'm just not into too much sugar. Overall, nice spot. Will return."

I asked if they had decaf and they hesitated meaning I'm getting full caffeine. I make my own cold brew so I know you're supposed to serve coffee at a certain Temperature and this was scalding. I asked questions re: food and they weren't sure of what the item was. Altho they were very nice, Im disappointed since I threw out the coffee unable to drink this water."

I limited my visits to Coffee Spot only for eggs & home-fries breakfast pickups. Often times they screw up the order and I would look the other way, but today I lost my patience. Sigh. The eggs were so burned they were inedible. I threw it all out.  Why would you serve your customer such burned food? It costs pennies to re-make 2 eggs, and maybe 5-min of time.  Major fail... won't be coming back anymore."

The shelf in the container that holds the pastries is very dirty and looks like it has collected dirt from the past years. You see it on the left side immediately when you first walk in. On the right is a display of cards/ advertisements and it's all very cluttered.  Baristas have an unfriendly vibe. They are wearing their face masks under their chins. When I went to pay for my drink they said they only take cash so I wasn't able to take it because I only had card. I think it all worked out for the best because the place was so dirty I was probably saved from having a stomach ache.

There were some pastries on display that I've never seen before, so I asked them. I couldn't believe my ears, with each of food that they desperately did not want to name, these vile girls decide to give me the eye roll. I might have lost my bananas if it wasn't for me having a great day. But I did lose my bananas 2 minutes later. A lady who spoke with a heavy accent ordered coffee. Already the girls behind the counter started laughing & talking in their own language while looking back at the lady. Clearly, they were talking about her. The lady asked for a coffee tray in ENGLISH but the girl couldn't understand her. I kindly asked if I can help the lady to translate clearer. The girl said, ""WE DONT SPEAK CHINESE HERE"".  I was so appalled I started arguing with her. It was the most inappropriate thing I've ever heard come out of someone who deals with customers on a daily basis. So screw your coffee, screw your food, even if this was the last restaurant on this earth, I would never step foot in this place again. If you decide to come here & you happened to not be like them, don't be surprised if you get the same treatment as we did. You have been fairly warned."

I only continued coming all these years because it's got really good food so I guess that's why they don't care how bad the service is because they know people will always flock no matter how they're being treated. I gotta finally leave a review because it's reached a point where I will not be coming back here. Currently 8 months expecting, it's the heat of summer, ordered 2 coffees & guess what? I waited 25 min & just left. All the staff see the pregnant lady waiting & nothing even though I asked the status of my order & was ignored. Regardless of my current state of stomach, still a gross disservice to any customer. But again, this place will never change so it's up to customers to risk being treated like crap over a good brownie."

I get home with my orders and neither one of them have cheese.. so even when I tried to make sure they got my order right, they still got it wrong. I'll keep my business at bagel boy around the block, the lines there are longer but the guys behind the counter tend to get the order right the first time around."

One of the women behind the counter took my friend's coffee order while another staff member poured our soup into to-go containers. I asked the same woman behind the counter for a coffee since she was about to pour a cup for my friend (who was white). She looked at me incredulously as though she couldn't believe I asked her to wait on me then sternly told me that I was already being helped (her coworker took our soup orders and told me to wait, in a very ""know your place"" kind of tone. She gave my friend her coffee and took the coffee order of the woman behind ne. The staff (who were also white) giggled at her treatment with me.

The crispy taco shells were extremely stale. They were also lacking everything except chicken and tomatoes. Check the picture. The salsa I used for the burrito also smelled wierd like it was rancid. I am not a picky eater, honestly. But this was gross. When I called in about it, I was received with 'well, I don't make the food so I don't know what you want' gotta be kidding me.

Steal someone's teeny tiny dog to eat? Your best bet is this place, not claiming to do anything other than fast cheap Tex-Mex, but they even go through the effort of making their own tortillas fresh. Easily feed 2 people under 15 bucks or grab a quick taco when short on time.Look at the front of the place, they are not advertised as an ""authentic Mexican"" eatery, others looking for upscale Mexican should go elsewhere for their over-priced food.I eat here probably once a week at least.Highs:Tacos, burritos, quesadillas... really anything with their tortillas.Lows:The guacamole is the caveat, consistently watery because of the amount of tomatoes they throw in to cut the price, but joke's on me for thinking I could get guac in NYC for cheaper than the current price of a single avocado.The rice alone is sad and bland, needs seasoning.**My rating is based on the other take-out cheap eats places in NYC not among ALL restaurants ever...obviously"

I needed to stop in Chinatown to pick up a wedding gift that I could ONLY GET in Chinatown (then had to take to Europe with me only to bring it back to Western NY... long story but really important to my review...)So, I'd finally schlepped all my stuff (rolly bag, backpack) down to Chinatown via the subway and walking. I purchased the aforementioned gift, and let's be honest, given the weather I was as sweaty as a... Nevermind.It was hot.  I was heavy laden with bags. I had hours to kill before my evening flight.  What is always the remedy for situations like this?Yes.Bubble tea.I pulled up my handy Yelp app, and made an executive decision to try out Vivi Bubble Tea which was basically around the corner.  And boy was it the best decision.Managing to get a stool, I camped out in this tiny little tea shop and sipped my refreshing large mango tea with mango jelly.  It was light, fresh, sweet (but not too sweet) and it calmed me down and made me feel like I could conquer the world.  Or at least the rest of my journey to JFK. That Howard Beach train... I'll tell ya.Vivi was a happening spot.  Tourists and locals both were in and out of th shop as I sat and people watched. If I were a local, I would come here.  The staff was friendly and knew how to deal with a rush of people which seemed to happen quiet often.  I will make it a point to return the next time I'm in town. mm. Bubble tea."

A typical hot-bar and salad restaurant, what Civic has that really puts itself above the rest are: 1) the free drinks with $7 purchase, 2) super fast lines, and 3) delicious hot sandwiches. I normally don't come here for the hot bar food, which usually runs dry and tough by around 1:15 when I arrive. Their selection is also pretty repetitive and doesn't change. I would recommend the sushi, the pastas, and their fish, but stay away from their calamari and fried ""shrimp"" as those are either really tough or a bit funky. My usual order is the small bowl of salad with bacon, fried chicken, sweet corn, avocados, and low fat ranch (muy delicioso!) and even if the lines look a little daunting, it's all pretty quick. The Chicken Colby, the Roast Beef, and the House Special sandwiches are all great too, but those usually take a little bit longer to make. The meatball is also pretty filling. All of these sandwiches are massive and an intelligent man would split it into two meals but... yah... I'm as smart as a fish and if I see food, I eat that shizz. If your order is over $7, which it almost always is, you get to grab a soda or a water on your way out. Sweet! A way better deal than you will get at most places."

The inverted roll was better than the regular futomaki. Not all selections are always available, but there is a good variety to choose from.  If you buy 6.00 worth of salad bar food or sandwich over $5.00, you get a free soda or small water.  There is also a counter for sandwiches and create your own tossed salads. Lining one wall are several refrigerators for drinks and an open refrigerator for popular beverages like coconut water, flavored teas and waters.  In the back, there are shelves of chips.  Dependable and convenient, I find the food tastier here than the other 2 salad bars located a block or two away.  They make sure the wait to pay is almost non-existent with their speedy efficiency."

Went back again with husband and had burger and chicken sandwich. Great food at good prices. Friendly staff."
1612,AYyoIDYcOmLPKp-il8iXlw,3/30/2015,3 star rating,"""Standard Lunch Spot""Typically, the people that frequent this place are employees of the hospital, patients/visitors and construction workers. Murphy's Law is has decent bar food with quick and reliable service. Also, the restaurant has a midrange beer list to take the edge off of whatever may ill you. I would recommend the chicken salad wrap, the burgers (the fries are pretty good) and the french onion soup. However, the Murphy's has different daily entree and soup specials, so you can think outside of the box for your culinary delights. Personally, I like the crab-meat stuffed tilapia. I think that it is frozen seafood but I do not come here for amazing seafood, so it all good for me. The food is not the greatest in the UES but it gets the job done. Plus, you can just have 4-8 beers or cocktails to make feel better if the food is not up to your standards."

They had Coors lite, Bud lite and Guinness on tap and called themselves a pub... no offense honey not gonna work if you have Pony bar as  competition nearby!But hey they have straightened up. They have like 7 things on tap now - still kinda limited and same stuff day in and day out... but at least they are moving in some kind of a direction other than downwards.The bartenders here are always the best.Hey I'll give them a couple of chances.

1615,AYyoIDYcOmLPKp-il8iXlw,1/6/2017,1 star rating,First and last time trying this place out. I wanted to try the food before hosting a birthday get together at the place. Part of my order was a Cesar salad. I got what thought to be an appetizer portion. I called to inquire about the portion size. I was told this the portion size we offer. I'm not a frugal person but for $9.95 this was not with it. And the burger was dry.

They never let your water glass stay empty for long, and the food was brought out rather quickly. We sat outside, and the heating was strong enough to make us forget that it was 56° out. My food was fantastic as well; I still don't understand how so much flavor can come in such a small package.Tips: - If you want to guarantee indoor seating, make a reservation. Otherwise, we've never had issues getting in without one. - If you don't drink, be sure to ask about their mocktails! I ordered the guava-flavored drink, and it was delicious! - They do not split checks, but that's a problem that Venmo can fix"

We got the nachos, fish tacos and steak tacos for appetizers all of which was great. The tacos were phenomenal and jam packed with protein and the flavors were great.My husband and I both got the La Michelada Tammarind which was delicious. My only complaint is that the mixture and beer came separate and it was up to you to stir it. This resulted in us finishing the drinks with a bunch of the mixture and spices sitting at the bottom of the glass. For entrees we got the chicken mole and chicken enchiladas. Both were incredible. I had the mole and the mole sauce was warm and flavorful and it great supply all over the chicken. The rice underneath the mole chicken was outstanding, flavorful and did a great job at soaking up the delicious mole sauce. My husbands enchiladas were great as well. The restaurant also brought out a little flan cake for my birthday which was a nice surprise and it was so yummy. It had a bottom crust that I think was graham cracker or some kind of textured cookie crumble which is interesting and Pairs well with the flan. The only issues I had with this place was that everything came out extremely fast with non lull time. When we ordered our appetizers they were on our table 10 minutes later. And the entrees were quick to follow. We like to have our dining experience be a little more drawn out. Despite this we would definitely come back here because the food was absolutely delicious and tasted authentic."

Definitely order cocktails; they were delicious! While these are definitely NYC prices, we both had well-portioned entrees (breakfast burrito for me, enchiladas for my friend). They also have a very cute dog menu, and my pup enjoyed hanging out with us, although he had breakfast before we came and declined to sample any dishes.  While we did sit outside, the interior is also adorable. I'd definitely check it out again to explore more of the menu!"
1627,BD2LXznE-qO5C2lXLrSrBA,12/15/2016,4 star rating,"IKEA FOOD - DELICIOUS AND INEXPENSIVE!!I absolutely love their Swedish meatballs with special gravy and lingonberry jam! It is seriously a MUST-GET in my opinion. Note: They sell frozen Swedish meatballs downstairs! It is good if you want to serve some of this deliciousness at home for parties and whatnot. Personally, I'd save the hassle of cooking at home though and just eat it right at IKEA. Shhhhh don't tell the husband but this is one of the reasons why I want to come to here haha.Speaking of my husband, he totally loves their chicken tenders, which are super tender, and it comes with fries!We seldom grab a side of cornbread if we were starving that day!Their coffee is very good too. If you get a cup, you get unlimited FREE refills! The same goes for soda. The dining area is big and spacious. It does get crowded during peak hours, but we could always find a table for 2, now 3 with our daughter, without any problems.If you sit by the window, you could get a good view outside!What is better than shopping and EATING and then go right back to shopping conveniently at the same area?!IKEA Restaurant - saves us time and money to eat outside!TIP: Scan your IKEA FAMILY card to see if there are any current deals and discounts for dine-in customers!"
1628,BD2LXznE-qO5C2lXLrSrBA,3/12/2016,3 star rating,For cafeteria style they have a smooth operation. Plenty of seating. I have tried several of the meals. I know which agree with my allergies and what to stay away from. Today the Chicken Tenders were very tasty. I loved the fries. The little desert was just enough to satisfy my need for a sweet treat. You can not beat the price. My meal was $8.69. The tables were clean and the space roomy. When I go to IKEA it is a full day. I enjoy knowing I can have a meal. There's plenty to see after eating. I get my exercise walking through the huge space. I recommend!

1630,BD2LXznE-qO5C2lXLrSrBA,9/3/2015,2 star rating,"The staff here seriously hates their lives, and it's reflected in your entire dining experience at Ikea. I don't come here expecting a 5-star meal (just fuel for the 6 miles I'll have to hike later), but basically every experience I've had here has been soured straight off with the apathy and attitude that the cafeteria employees exude.No smiles, no thank you's, no customer service. Just glares and servers yelling at you if you don't move fast enough. Food slopped on plates, disorganized self-service areas, and a whole lot of rudeness.Food is typical Ikea, maybe a little sadder and less carefully prepared than at other locations. I'm also upset that they no longer offer their salad bar, just tiny, prepackaged, wilted iceberg lettuce. Otherwise, it's just fine for a quick bite to eat before getting lost in the labyrinth that is Ikea."
1631,BD2LXznE-qO5C2lXLrSrBA,2/19/2016,3 star rating,"Food is real good, service is below par and crowds are a given (depending on what day/time you arrive). Just some of things you should expect whenever you dine at this IKEA. I've probably eaten at this IKEA 15+ times at all different times on weekdays and weekends and there are 2 things you're guaranteed every time, damn good cheap food and a nice view of Manhattan! The prices are always reasonable here for a meal and it's a great place to fill up before going on a shopping spree. The restaurant (and store) tend to be understandably much busier on weekend afternoons, so be prepared to wait on a line for food. The crowds are much much smaller when it comes to weekdays and evenings.The most popular order for most people are the Swedish Meatballs and I can't argue that decision. Make sure to always ask for extra gravy! and it's $1 more for 5 extra meatballs! Can't go wrong with that. However, if you're looking for something different, the Ribs and Chicken Tenders with fries are really good here too. The Chicken Tenders are especially filling because they come in such huge pieces! Don't forget to get some BBQ and Honey Mustard sauce by the condiment area. As for the fries, I can only compare them to Wendy's, so if you like Wendy's fries, you'll love them here.The service? That's a 180 from the food. The servers and cashiers pretty much do their job, however, none do it with a smile or greet you. When you order, don't expect a friendly hello or even a word from them because it rarely happens. If you get a hello, consider yourself lucky and play the lotto asap! They plop the food on your plate and throw the plate onto the counter for you and it's pretty much Next up. No ""enjoy"" or ""have a good day"" or any other type of friendly banter.Most of the cashiers are no different. I would say 95% of my experiences eating here have been the same, in terms of interaction or non-interaction with the employees. Hospitality is definitely a big issue with the employees working the restaurant area and, quite honestly, it's a major turnoff every time. I've been to other IKEAs and the service is usually friendlier. I've really only encountered this issue here with the hospitality.I would give the restaurant 4-5 stars, but the service absolutely counts here and brings them down a notch. The day I sense improvement, will be the day they really deserve that 4-5 star rating."
1632,BD2LXznE-qO5C2lXLrSrBA,1/16/2017,5 star rating,"When I'm on the water taxi to Ikea, I finalize & visualize my strategy for the invasion. This mission  isn't to be taken lightly. Prepping is an absolute must. A week out, you want to go to the doctor's and get your shit checked. No, for real, get your feces checked, because it tells a lot about your health status. Salt needs to be eliminated from the diet 69 hours out; make sure you are doing a.m. cardioYour emergency bag should contain: extra soft toilet paper, broken glass, Pepto, rabid ferrets, extra underwear & poison darts. The day of, wear: drawstring pants, a note with emergency contact info, plus instructions laminated and worn around your neck. Don't wear a top, the paramedics need easy access incase of heart failure. Yes, they have to let you in, because it's legal in NY to go topless.  As the boat makes it's way to the dock, position yourself accordingly at the exit. As soon as that weird kid with the counter thingy lifts the chains, run like a Jamaican sprinter. The people on the boat are your enemy; they are all headed for the back of the same line and if you let them get ahead of you, a longer wait awaits. That sounded weird, but I'm gonna leave it.  The first 100 feet after disembarking is crucial. Take out anyone who got a jump on you with the poison darts. As you get to the entrance of the parking structure, chances are the enemy is closing in; carefully drop the broken glass behind you, this will give you an additional few seconds that's vital.You've now made it to the back of the line. Exhausted and sweaty, take a moment and collect yourself and then...release the ferrets. Boom! You are now at the front of the line. Act like nothing happened and grab a tray for the home stretch. Calmly gather your bounty. Yes, to anything that starts with ""chocolate"" and ends with ""cake"". Ditto, anything with salmon. The meatballs are a must; order the beef and get the side of chicken meatballs for a buck. Go for two of that crack toast. One juice box, two waters (you'll need this post meal, because you will be dehydrated AF from all the saltiness ) and coffee. The coffee is crucial do to the impending itus and w/o it, you won't be able to forge ahead for what is inevitably a 3 hour tour of options that all seem like a great idea--until 8 months later when everything you bought starts to break, because it's....Ikea. Was it worth it? The furniture and random shit you didn't need, no. The food, yes."
1633,BD2LXznE-qO5C2lXLrSrBA,8/13/2019,3 star rating,"I'm not sure I would make it a point to go visit IKEA just to hit up the restaurant, but after winding your way through the various showrooms, it's a bit of a nice haven to run into before heading downstairs to the smaller pieces and the warehouse. It's basically like a school cafeteria - grab a tray, stand in line, and point at what you want. Despite the simplicity and nostalgia that it may induce, the food is definitely more than passable, and given the cheapness (at least for NYC), you will find yourself filled up without feeling too terrible about the caloric intake. The Swedish meatballs are classic and are slathered generously with the delicious gravy, and the mashed potatoes were solid, if definitely more like the processed variety as opposed to the freshly-prepared. The chocolate cake was a nice surprise, though - although it was chilled, so a bit unnaturally cold, it wasn't too dense and tasted quite good.The restaurant hews pretty closely to the ethos of IKEA, and the result is a fairly cheap meal that is very no-frills, in terms of variety and seating amenities (McDonald's might have nicer seating these days), but it does the job. If you're not in the mood to venture out to nearby spots in Red Hook, you could certainly do worse."

For dessert, I tried their delicious and crunchy Daim cake.Great/calm atmosphere, surrounded by their IKEA magic and charm and a nice view of Manhattan to top it off. Clean space with good vibes."
1635,BD2LXznE-qO5C2lXLrSrBA,5/27/2017,4 star rating,"I've always been a fan of IKEA food. The Swedish meatballs has always been one of my favorites. I would highly recommend buying a bag of frozen meatballs from their marketplace. I think a bag of Swedish meatballs are $9.99 now. They're easy to prepare and my son loves them. The lingonberry sauce is sweet and tasty but I wouldn't buy a jar of the sauce to go. It's a good sauce, I just don't find myself using that sauce often enough at home. At the cafeteria, a little dab of it is just fine. I do however enjoy the lingonberry beverage that is available the fountain. Without ice, it taste a little like watered down wine. With ice, it taste like ice cold gatorade. It's not carbonated and the level of sweetness of this drink is perfect. I would figure the drink would be as sweet as their sauce but it's not. My most recent favorite dish in the IKEA cafeteria would be their cured salmon salad. I can eat this thing all day. It's so refreshing. The salad and it's sauce compliments the salmon so well. It's savory and does not leave a fishy smell in your breath afterwards. The meal is very delightful and I plan on learning how to make this salmon at home. I also ordered a side of french fries and macaroni and cheese. The fries were pretty legit. They weren't soggy at all. As for the mac n cheese, the scoop I got on my plate was small! I looked at the person next to me who also ordered mac and cheese and he got a plateful! I was pretty disappointed in that.Verdict - Furniture shopping and good school cafeteria style food. Sounds awful but it's like good grade school/hospital food. I think that's the best way I could put it. It's nothing fancy obviously, but for what it's worth, I think the food is decent. I'm not always a fan of the service. The kitchen staff and cashiers are often pushy and rude. If you have a IKEA rewards card, you can get a free cup of coffee."
1636,BD2LXznE-qO5C2lXLrSrBA,4/3/2016,3 star rating,"Managed to get to the restaurant a few minutes before closing. They were out of a few food options but not what I was craving.Ordered the Swedish meatball meal ($5). A big handful of miniature meatballs with a side of cranberry sauce and mashed potatoes smothered in gravy. The meatballs are seasoned well but not as hearty as you expect ground beef to be. The cranberry sauce is especially delicious with that nice tart finish. The mash is your standard fare. Also got a can of Pear cider ($3), nonalcoholic yet really refreshing.By no means is this food amazing. The price makes it worthwhile, especially since you'll be spending a lot of time running through the IKEA gauntlet."
1637,fJbGp0s_Ld3c0oHa1awjfg,11/23/2021,4 star rating,This place is actually pretty good for Japanese food in this area with a reasonable price range. Their Chinese food is so so. My family has been going there occasionally for Sushi rolls.
1638,fJbGp0s_Ld3c0oHa1awjfg,3/13/2021,5 star rating,"Admittedly my go-to spot for sushi in Brooklyn, or in NYC overall, for that matter. The sushi is very good quality, especially at its current price point. My favorite set to get is the Edo Omakase One which comes with toro, torched toro, uni, scallop, and several other types of pieces that you would often find in $50+ omakase sets in NYC. However, the Edo Omakase One has 35 pieces of sushi overall at only $60, which can feed ~3 people. What I've found in NYC is that usually either you pay $ for sushi at cheaper restaurants which generally only serve lower-quality cuts, or $$$$ for high quality pieces and expensive cuts of fish. However, I've so seldomly found a place like this that has the best of both worlds. Truly a gem, and I highly recommend this spot for your next sushi craving."
1639,fJbGp0s_Ld3c0oHa1awjfg,12/30/2020,3 star rating,"The good things out of the way first; the food I like. Their pork katsu is juicy and better tasting than katsu at Samurai Sushi. The prices are also very affordable. However, I've found that some of the employees are not unprofessional. When I called to pick up, they don't tell you the amount for the food and don't ask for your name. Their menu is also confusing because it's packed with a ton of things, so when I tried to order Chicken Katsu Curry Rice, which I thought was straightforward, the person on the phone went, ""green?"" and I was like no, I meant the brown kind. They also don't do Pork Katsu Curry Rice for some reason, so I just get Pork Katsu as an appetizer and cook my own rice and veggies at home.Inside the restaurant, no social distancing here. The entrance of the restaurant is really small, and all the customers just pack inside to wait. Because it's so tiny, there's no way to separate people who are picking up from those waiting to order. My mom had to start her own pickup line outside and tell people to wait outside too instead of crowding indoors."
1640,fJbGp0s_Ld3c0oHa1awjfg,3/11/2021,3 star rating,"If you want authenticity of Japanese/Malaysian/Thai/etc foods, this is not the place. If you want cheap comfort food, you found the spot! Their Japanese foods (raw stuff aka sushi and cooked foods) aren't authentic at all. Everything is made for the Chinese/Cantonese palette. Pre-COVID: I came here a few times for Japanese foods indoor, some of the sashimi were fresh, but it didn't feel Japanese to me. I always see this as a Chinese-Japanese place. Small inside, customers are usually crammed with each other. Can be a long wait just to sit down around dinner time.Post-COVID: Got delivery, food has gotten cold by the time it arrived (maybe of the distance?). The delivery guy was semi-complaining that I lived far when I gave him money (lol...). Anyway, I got the croquet bento box everyone here raved about, stir-fried pearl noodles, and Taiwanese chicken bento (with free stew chicken leg). The Croquet Bento Box was meh -- cold/room temp foods, very sweet curry sauce, weird few pieces of fried chicken nibbles...price is very cheap yeah, it'll fill you up but I didn't really enjoy it.Stir-fried Pearl Noodles (dragon phoenix) -- edible, but all you can taste is soy sauce flavor, nothing else, so very meh. No other spice, just soy sauce.Taiwanese chicken bento -- fried chicken leg thats fried too long, rice was okay, love the Japanese style egg, the free stewed chicken leg is a nice touch but it still had hairs on it, and it might be best if you don't put cooked foods in a plastic bag."

It's been a while since i've had fishball cheurng fun from a street cart (i'm sure most of them aren't working now due to the pandemic) so i was glad to see they added this to their menu. I enjoyed the beef tripe and pig skin. I wasn't a huge fan of the cheurn fun because it tastes a bit hard but I do appreciate that they even have this available.

I also decided to try the Salty Fish Chicken Curry Fried Rice which was a change from the un-curried ones from other restaurants. The rice was also good; a welcomed change from my usual. The rice had an ample amount of fish and chicken stirred fried with a hint of curry flavor. Both dishes were satisfying and I will be definitely coming back to try the others."

We sat outside where it was nice and cozy except for the few motorcycle dudes popping wheelies on Vernon. Not the restaurant's fault mind you. I ordered a Frozen Sangrita and we got sopos or whatever for the appetizer. These items took forever to get to us. My drink was supposed to be frozen and when I got it, it looked like climate change affected humanity once again. It tasted great but it must've been left out for 15 minutes or so. Again...the appetizer was good and the drink had a great flavor but just took way too long. We ordered a pernil and ropa vieja for the entrees and these took forever to come out as well. There was apparently only one server so I wasn't too upset but the girl moved at a snail's pace. The food must've been sitting out for a while too since it was no longer hot. The taste was really good so I'm not knocking them for that. What I will knock them for is not having sufficient staff to bring out the food while it's still hot. Though this was the issue at the other location as well so it could be that management isn't on top of the kitchen as much as it should be. All in all, would I comeback? Unless it's 100 degrees outside where it's impossible for my food to come out lukewarm, then probably not. Are they horrible? Not at all, but they do need to make some adjustments and I think they will be great."

The restaurant has a great aesthetic and was full of what looked like very happy patrons. The bartender and hosts were very nice and provided great service. We ordered both the classic mojito and cachaca. Both were refreshing with a decent pour. I think this place would be great for Happy Hour, as these were the quality of drinks provided. I don't think I would come back and pay full price. My review is solely based on drinks at the bar, so I will return to give the food and table service a try."

We ordered shrimp egg foo young, general taos chicken, dumplings, and a soup. The dumplings was a little burnt and you definitely need salt and pepper on the food just a tad bland.

Waste of money would never return, first and last time Applebee's or whatever does better wings even the local Chinese food spot is a better bet not to mention one wing averaged to right around a $1 a pop. They were not separated correctly either from them or where they buy them from because they had bone from the other section of the wing. Still attached from not being cut correctly. What a joke see photo for reference also dry and hard"

Wings, fries, and a coke I said. Minutes later, behold, 8 beautiful wings, golden fries, and my soft drink. However, to my surprise, I had a bundle of napkins, wipes, salt, pepper, celery, carrots, and dipping sauce. I knew I was in for a messy treat, and couldn't wait to dig in. As I was eating, the owner checked on me a few times to make sure everything was fine, and they were. Food was great, service was wonderful, 10/10 I will be back.Edit - I'm currently eating dinner, and I'm still thinking about the wings. What a great day."

But I would advise you to call your order in because the wait can be long but that's what happens when you get quality food that taste good and smells good. Customer service can be improved and they need a new phone everything I call when I'm driving the guy either says I'm far away or I have to call back about 2-3 times to speak to someone. The wings are sooo good tasteful and delicious, I've been coming to Wing wagon for over 10 years and I'm also pleased with my order."
1717,Cj-dQiRCayppFl3gTtAA8g,5/11/2017,5 star rating,"Reviewing both the ""Wine Tasting +Tour Event"" as well as my dining experience at Brooklyn Winery is truly a pleasure for me, especially since all of it was so wonderfully memorable. Brooklyn Winery is beautifully decorated and structured. I met my friend in the front portion of the place that has their bar and table settings. We were quickly informed that the Wine Tasting and Tour Event (which was $25) would begin, so we walked into the room next door. Tour Guide Douglas greeted us with a warm smile and handed us our first glass of wine. In a matter of minutes, there were soon places with 11 other individuals at adjacent tables. Douglas ensured that he was knowledgeable of the various wines we were given throughout the tasting as well as the wine making process they use within Brooklyn Winery once the grapes are sent to the establishment. The wine tasting consisted of tasting 8 different wines which included:1.) 2014 Chardonnay  (unoaked) -White Wine2.) 2014 Reisling - White Wine 3.) 2014 Reisling - (Barrel Fermented) -White Wine4.) 2016 Dry Rose5.) 2012 Pinot Noire - Los Carnes (Red Wine)6.) 2013 North Fold Bland (Red Wine)7.) 2013 Sonoma Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Wine)8.) 2013 Old Vine Zinfandel (Red Wine)I am definitely a White Wine kind of woman, so I enjoyed the first 3 wines the most...however they were all great! Random Obsevration: it was so special to see an engaged couple meeting with a staff person to discuss where everything will be set up/structured and also viewing the space to prepare for their upcoming wedding...how romantic!The tour portion also consisted of being shown where the tanks are stored that are used within the fermentation process as as well as the specific area that houses the stored barrels of wine. The most interesting tidbit I learned is that each one of Brooklyn Winery's barrels of stored wine creates 300 individual bottles of wine!  Once the tour and wine tasting ended, we were hungry so we remained there to have some shared plates of food for dinner. We had Duck Pate, Lamb Sliders and Turkey + Golden Raisin Meatballs w/ Baby Spinach and Greek Yogurt. All of the dishes were rich in flavor!!! Although the plates seemed small, it was actually so much to eat that I was full once everything was consumed. I walked out content and with a smile on my face!I need to come back one day, enjoy their romantic, candlelit ambiance (such pretty flowers) and try the other various dishes as well as partake of some more of the fabulous wine!"

I ordered the al fresco wine flight, as it is summertime and I wanted something refreshing - it started with a sparkling white, white, then rose. All 3 of the wines were delicious and were good pours. We ordered the cheese board as well, and it was perfect for the 3 of us. They prefer you make reservations. Do it! You'll love it! Not too expensive either. $18 for the flight and $18 for the cheese board. It's right off the L train too, so it's convenient to get to."

I live a few blocks away and although it's been on my list for years, I finally made it out here with my wife.We were here for appetizers and wine before dinner at another place. But after seeing some of the delicious main dishes coming out of the kitchen, I wish we would have stayed here for dinner as well.On to the wine and apps though. We did a sampler of 3 upstate New York wines and got a full glass of Riesling and Zinfandel after, all of the wines were great. I'm not a big wine fan, my wife is, but I was happy and impressed. For the apps, we had the assorted olives and nuts. Both plates were very generous and tasty. We made it in for the happy hour, so got a few bucks off most items, another plus.Service was good and the bartender was very knowledgeable about the wine. Can't wait to come back."

I say that because without the name of the restaurant on the outside you might actually miss it. I came here for a Friday 8pm class (wine tour and tasting). With a total cost of $25 per person you're able to get a 30 minute tour of the winery along with 30 minutes of wine tasting. I have to say everything was well worth it. Our tour guide whose name I've sadly forgot ( Sarah maybe) was awesome and so sweet. She knew a lot about the wines and just had really good energy. This tour and tasting was intimate enough for a date and even good enough for a girls night. I would like to add that of all the wines we tasted ( 6, I believe) we ended up buying two :-))) If you're ever thinking of a good date night, night out with the girls,etc definitely come here. 5 stars all around and I would definitely come back!"

We ordered a bunch of appetizers that were all delicious. I enjoyed most of them although preferred some over the others while my coworkers had different options.Overall everything was delicious (including the wine). Definitely a great place to visit and I would definitely bring friends or family who enjoy wine tasking or just drinking and eating tapas in general!

We started off with their orange wine which was delicious and a must if you come here. We also got a cheese board and the cheeses were delicious!! This place is very unique and I love getting to choose local wines from New York to drink. This place is great for date night or a night out with girls. Be ready to shell out cash because you are paying for the quality of wine and the experience!
1723,Cj-dQiRCayppFl3gTtAA8g,2/16/2016,5 star rating,"I looooove wine! I saw a deal for $10 off a wine tour and tasting on Yelp and I quickly hopped on it. They had two tours that particular Tuesday....6:30pm & 8pm. The restaurant is beautiful! Very woodsy....gave me a Poconos cabin vibe. We went for the 6:30 tour and although we were late, the staff were very friendly and understanding, and quickly got us caught up. We put our coats up, received our souvenir wine glasses, got some Chardonnay in them, and joined the rest of the group. The group was rather small (about 8 people total). Our tour guide was Sarah. She was very nice, knowledgeable, and informative. She even went back to go over the little that we missed and answered all of our questions. Once the tour was over, the tasting began. We tasted about 8 different types of white and red wines. I'm not a fan of red wine at all so I drank them but didn't really enjoy them. I liked allllll the white wines. The Zinfandel was my least favorite and the Riesling was the best for me!The wine was so good and fresh and very potent. If you really liked one, Sarah would pour a little extra...Yasss honey! All the wines were available for sale at very reasonable prices.The tour is an hour...30 minute tour, 30 minute tasting. It also didn't take long for us to find parking in that area. I definitely plan on returning for the ambiance and the wine."

It was absolutely perfect and i'm so sad it's all over! I just want to do it all again! Firstly, booking the venue and working Marisa was such an easy experience - Marisa was extremely friendly, informative and helpful. She was so easy to deal with. From there, we had the most fantastic wedding tasting with lots of other couples getting married, it felt very intimate and special.Following that, we were introduced to Jessica our day of co-ordinator. let me tell you, we feel so truly lucky to have worked with her, she is absolutely brilliant. She was extremely organized and had every detail covered! Especially as we needed alot of hand holding - she was completely patient and really supported us through the whole process. We ended up booking alot of the suggested vendors, partly because they were priced most competitively but also because the Winery and vendors work seamlessly together - perhaps this was Jessica's special magic again but we didnt coordinate a single thing, it was all arranged for us. Especially on the day of - it couldnt had gone smoother. Jessica was like a dear friend on the day - she anticipated our every need and even carved out special moments for us to enjoy privately. As for the staff - they have the most superb team in there, there is this type of lovely energy about the team. They are so polite and friendly and truly can't do enough for either you or the guest. They are magic, and they made the day so special for us. They made everyone feel like VIP guests. We had a million compliments about the staff. Honestly, I could go on for about another ten pages. From start to end - it was a dream come true, and I couldn't be more pleased. Thank you from the bottom of my heart! You guys rock."

The owner or manager (I'm not completely sure) did reach out to me and was mortified about the situation. She called and assured me that the wine sniffing is not a practice they participate in post-pandemic. She also informed me that she did have a meeting with the staff and individually with our original server to reiterate their restaurant safety practices. We were invited back and had a complimentary gift to our table. The service was as impeccable as the first time (apart from the incident). It truly was an excellent experience. All of the food and wine we had were absolutely delicious. I really appreciated how to situation was all handled! Will definitely be returning and will definitely recommend it!

You can get a flight for $20 (choose your own) or choose a premade combo for less. The shared items were good but was eventually too sweet. Everything had some type of sweet sauce or honey on it. I didn't like that there weren't any cocktail options and grew tired of the wines.

And to top it off, the driver forgot the sodas, and when I let him know, he said -I'll be right back. 30 minutes past, so I called the restaurant, to find out what had happen to the sodas. The girl who took the order, asked the driver, and he said -I'm not going back there, in Spanish. So I said -can you add that credit, to my next order. She said - we don't do that here, you can come to pick it up or send someone, I'll have it ready for you. Lol...what was the sense, in ordering in, if I have to pick it up."

My issue is the blonde morning hostess who changes the prices as she sees fit or whatever her mood strikes. I get the same breakfast nearly twice a week for almost 3 years(I've lived around the corner ten), had she informed me that prices have gone up, I would not be writing this review. I buy 2 pieces of fried cheese and 2 pieces of salami each time. SHE told me since she took that morning position that it's 50 cents per piece. Hector the cook said this to the other woman who worked the mornings before her as well. So why am I being charged 50 cents more all of a sudden for the same breakfast that hasn't changed and not notified that the price went up BEFORE she serves me? I'm a regular I know how much it is. So when I ask why it's gone up don't be rude and tell me that you told me before. You didn't. And you've done this three times too many on separate occasions. Either keep the price the same for all customers at all times or don't serve. It's against the law to charge beyond set prices. They're lucky to get 1 star and it's because hector knows how to cook. I would gladly give 5 stars when the service improves."

I usually stray away from Lo Mein, but the one made at Liu's Shanghai tasted SO good. I'm so accustomed to trying the westernized Chinese fast food style lo mein which I abhor, but the lo mein here tastes very authentic and the noodles are pan fried to perfection. The fried rice cakes are a classic must order in any Shanghai spot. And lastly, the hot & sour soup was a good mix of spicy and sour, and reminded me of my mom's fujianese meals.

Their food made with love, serviced with care, and takeout packaged delicately. I come often when I'm craving Shanghai, sometimes to dine in and sometimes to takeout. It's always comforting and never disappoints. Their XLB (xiao long bao), the Shanghai steamed soup pork bun has a thin, delicate skin that is a delight to chew with the aromatic pork and soup. This is best for dine-in as takeout can cause the skin of the pork bun to stick together and inevitably burst the soupy pork bun. Also, it's meant to be eaten piping hot.My favorite is so simple, but so good - the Shanghai fried rice. It just has egg, scallion, and rice but it is seasoned so perfectly and it's good by itself or as a base for all your other dishes. Another favorite is the preserved vegetables with pork belly. It's so tender and so flavorful, it's truly the perfect dish to have with some rice. It's also a form of comfort food and tastes very homey. Typically, I also get string beans, scallion pancake, and the beef pan fried noodles. Everything is always cooked well and is worth every penny. For dessert, they give a complementary sweet sweet potato tapioca soup or a red bean tapioca soup. This place can get busy on some nights.

The chicken noodle lacked taste as well, needed to add additional soy sauce from my own pantry. I wanted to try Shanghaiese Jiajiang Mian~sauce was very liquidity, unlike the Korean style ones. My meal came with two free dessert sweet soups~ Tasted good."

I was happy to see they have a wide range of meals aside from soup dumplings. We ordered a bunch of dishes for our table but my favorites were the Lo Mein, Fried Rice Cake, and the Hot & Sour soup. I usually stray away from Lo Mein, but the one made at Liu's Shanghai tasted SO good. I'm so accustomed to trying the westernized Chinese fast food style lo mein which I abhor, but the lo mein here tastes very authentic and the noodles are pan fried to perfection. The fried rice cakes are a classic must order in any Shanghai spot. And lastly, the hot & sour soup was a good mix of spicy and sour, and reminded me of my mom's fujianese meals. I didnt get to try the soup dumplings, but my friends loved it. They also give a complementary dessert at the end! Liu's Shanghai is a gem and I'm so happy to have discovered it because of my friends! I'll definitely be returning for more food."

We ordered the scallion pancake, crab meat & pork soup dumplings, pan fried noodles with a little bit of everything, and beef with mushrooms & bamboo shoots. Everything was delicious! It was a very hearty and comforting meal. Good service as well. I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you are in the Bath Beach area."

However, they have some of the best soup dumplings and some of the best food in the area. Bailey (the male waiter) welcomes everyone in with a smile. This is a family establishment and all the employees treat the customers amazingly. Everything here is flavorful but not over saturated with oil or salt. My favorite items include any of the soup dumplings, the fried chicken, and the fried wontons. These three items pack enough flavor to last you the whole day. My inner fat kid loves saving the sauce and drizzle from the fried wontons and using it to dip the soup dumplings for extra flavor."
1762,WxNlqGSsj_2TCodkx9Sa4A,8/26/2022,5 star rating,"I love this little neighborhood Shanghai restaurant. They are a true mom and pop shop run by a family. Their food made with love, serviced with care, and takeout packaged delicately. I come often when I'm craving Shanghai, sometimes to dine in and sometimes to takeout. It's always comforting and never disappoints. Their XLB (xiao long bao), the Shanghai steamed soup pork bun has a thin, delicate skin that is a delight to chew with the aromatic pork and soup. This is best for dine-in as takeout can cause the skin of the pork bun to stick together and inevitably burst the soupy pork bun. Also, it's meant to be eaten piping hot.My favorite is so simple, but so good - the Shanghai fried rice. It just has egg, scallion, and rice but it is seasoned so perfectly and it's good by itself or as a base for all your other dishes. Another favorite is the preserved vegetables with pork belly. It's so tender and so flavorful, it's truly the perfect dish to have with some rice. It's also a form of comfort food and tastes very homey. Typically, I also get string beans, scallion pancake, and the beef pan fried noodles. Everything is always cooked well and is worth every penny. For dessert, they give a complementary sweet sweet potato tapioca soup or a red bean tapioca soup. This place can get busy on some nights. They're small, but much loved by the neighborhood so it gets packed. Parking is pretty limited in the area, but it's doable."

I can definitely say that I have experienced waaayy better tacos from various food trucks in Jackson Heights. Hell, I have experienced waayyy better tacos in my kitchen.  I ordered the Al Pastor and Carnitas tacos and I have to say that I was very disappointed because the tacos were waaaayyyy too greasy and the carnitas had more fat than pork. Also, the tortilla chips were super greasy and the salsa really was watered down tomato paste. Maybe the place was having an off night, because I did not find anything redeeming about this place or which it would have decent reviews on Yelp. One the other side of the coin, the service was crap too. I do not know which was worse our service or the food. Our waitress seemed very uninterested in serving us and it seemed like she has a bad attitude in life. We would order the food and she did not make any eye contact, so I did not know if she even heard order. It turns out that she did not hear the order because I had to repeat myself. Sorry for ""making"" you do your job, sweetheart.  If your food is going to be a struggle, then maybe the service should not be a struggle too. Just a thought. Normally, many hole in the wall places manage to turn out great food but I will have to say Taqueria El Fogon is not one of those places. Maybe the other Taqueria El Fogon is better. I would say that the only redeeming factors of this place is: 1) the food is cheap (tacos are about $2.50) and 2) they show American movies dubbed in Spanish (we had the viewing pleasure of ""21 Jumpstreet"")."

Service can be a bit slow - but if you in a hurry, you can order though seamless. (Some days I don't want to rush through my meal tho)There is plenty of seating - and I really liked those wooden tables and chairs.

1776,BYKqlvwqYw9UTQcctMg4Ag,1/9/2020,4 star rating,"Last night, I went to The Cutting Room to check out The Sound and Vision of David Bowie show (2nd night). The place has great sound - I'd say the best I've heard in any of the Manhattan venues I've been to. It was like CD-quality sound that night. The set-up is like a supper club, so there's the stage and then a bunch of tables up front, to the sides, and (I believe) tables on the balcony level - (I could kind of see the balcony level from where I was standing, which was by the door closer to the bar). For this show, doors were 6:30pm and the show was at 8pm. In these situations, it's just more convenient to go in at doors and get a table and eat/get drinks until showtime. That was the original plan, but after I looked at the menu and considered my SO's dietary needs and preferences, I had to find another place for dinner and then come to the venue later. Although we had a great dinner elsewhere, when we got there at 7:30pm, there were no tables available and we were stuck standing. Fortunately, we got a nice spot with a view of the stage and one of the TV screens (to the right and left of the stage or screens projecting what's taking place on the stage). The show was fantastic!Restrooms are downstairs. The stairwell to get downstairs is towards the front of the place. When you enter The Cutting Room, the door to the stairwell will be to your left. You descend and then turn a corner and walk down a hallway. You'll see the signs to your right at the end. If you're lucky, you may run into the acts performing because the green room is downstairs, too. Like the rest of the venue, downstairs is interesting - there's artwork lining the hallway walls and even the bathrooms have a sleek/chic/cool look.I'd come here again. The biggest positive is that the venue has a great sound system... Oh, one random thing, I saw Chris North there last night. He was taking video of one of the songs performed with his phone, like right by us. Most likely you'll see him here, too."

As a music venue, it feels intimate, yet spacious, and everyone in the house can easily see the performers. They also had a screen in the front area so people who were not sitting could watch. The decoration immediately caught my eye as soon as I walked in. The vibe is classy and funky, with super eclectic decor on the walls, like drawings of singers and posters with quotations. It stands out in the midtown bar scene, for sure. Service was great. Bartenders were fun and easy. Busboys cleaned up tables regularly. There was also table service available if you wanted something that wasn't included on the event's menu. We had wine, beer, cocktails, and sparkling water available at our open bar, and the food we tried included sliders, grilled cheese, vegetables and hummus, pigs in a blanket, tacos, and more. I wouldn't come here for the food, but it's there if you want to eat while at a show. I was really digging those guac and cheese wraps. Definitely pop in for a show if you're looking for something different to do."

No opening act was mentioned. We arrived at 7. The line was all the way down the block and the doors weren't even open to enter. Why? Nowhere on their website did it say doors open at X. We didn't even get into the venue until after 8 pm, waiting outside for an hour, standing and sweating on a hot humid night with no nearby delis to grab some water. There were absolutely zero seats with any view at all when we got in. The only place open was the corner balcony in the back. Although there were menus on the table there was no waitress. It was hot up there and after waiting outside for an hour with nothing to drink, I tried to go all the way back downstairs to the bar but it was too crowded to attempt. After waiting more, the terrible opening act came on. At this point we were so dehydrated, hot and cranky from not even being able to see we left before the act that I had been looking forward to for weeks came on stage. What was the point we couldn't see anyway. People in the balcony were getting nasty too yelling at others to move. I remember cutting room from its old location was always a good time. No idea what kind of shit show it's turned into but I would absolutely not recommend returning unless it's an unpopular act and you don't mind waiting undetermined amounts of time without further explanation and minimal AC."

The happy hour cocktail prices were based on the temperature. At 40 degrees my authentic mulled wine was $6. At 1 degree it would be $1. My dining companion had the South African red blind canned wine and said it was better than expected. My gruyere burger came with mesclun salad and I upgraded to homemade sweet potato fries. I asked for Dijon mustard on the side. The food was fresh and delicious. We split a creme brûlée which was just perfect. They had overhead heating and also mini fireplaces. I'd like to go for dinner when it gets warmer. Also 10% off with Yelp check in:-)
1787,I-tX4VWJJrrwBQ6E7_wwYw,3/9/2022,4 star rating,"While the happy hour sounds like a cool idea (the lower the temp, the lower the cocktail price), don't be fooled. The drinks are not why one visits. The heated wine with an orange slice was very unappealing to the taste. The best of the bunch was either the Hotty Toddy or the Apple Cider. There is no strength in the cocktails, so don't bother to get buzzed. Instead, come for the chic low key ambience that Brooklyn is known for- excellent spot for group dinner with about 5 friends, under warm subtle lighting. And OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS LAMB BURGER combos next to outdoor heaters."

So all you fancy drinkers cut it out stick to the basics like wine or try the Kombucha Tea which who knew was 44% alcohol. But anyway it was healthy and delicious.  My Co-Worker had the french onion soup she said it was delicious. I had the grilled Salmon medium with mashed potatoes and string beans. Every since I've been wanted mashed potatoes they were delicious. Overall we had a great experience the waiter was very friendly and attentive. The new normal is kind of hard to embrace like all changes. Social Distancing is a most. Where your damn mask. If not for your life, the life of someone else.

If you're a bit concerned about social distancing they have multiple outdoor seating and the waiters are wearing masks. I started with the Aval Artisanal cider which is a nice dry cider. According to friends Jon and Liz, the Aperol sprites were perfect, they loved the presentation as well as the carafe it was in. For lunch, Jon and I had the spicy salmon burger except I had it with truffle oil. They mistakenly brought Jon a vegetarian burger, but the waiter acknowledged his mistake and got him the salmon burger. The burger itself was ok, it was not spicy and was dry so I would suggest asking for chipotle mayo to give it an additional kick because it is not applied in the burger. Even though it's written on the menu. The truffle fries however were delicious. We also share a burrata salad which is red wine tomatoes, red beets, and oil-cured olives and it was delicious.There is a salmon dish I'd like to try here but I'm sure I can find time again to return.

My partner and I came ~15 minutes after open and asked to be seated outside for their temp sensitive happy hour. We each ordered a hot toddy and asked for the French onion soup to split for now (was planning to order more but wanted to take time so food didn't get cold all at once) and were informed we must each order a food item to qualify for the deal. (I was there a week before with a friend and split fries with the happy hour drinks honored but whatever) so we order fries too. We get drinks + food and are eating when we try to order another round. The server then tells us that we actually need to order an appetizer and an entree each to qualify for another drink and will have to order more food each round. This does not make sense to me (especially given we were still eating our starters) so we got the check. When I received the check I noticed the total higher than expected and checked the itemized receipt to see that I had been charged for the 51-55° happy hour when it was 17° outside and a high of 29° for the day. This was 9 a drink vs 4 and when I checked the sign for the right price noticed the fine print just mentioned order of a ""food item"" and 3 drink minimum. Bad dishonest service and being treated like a burden at a place I've supported for years/throughout the pandemic......will not be returning."

To start we ordered the burrata appetizer, it was tasty, a rather interesting placement of the prosciutto and the jam but we figured it out. For lunch the mussels and fries in a white wine sauce were ordered. They were a good amount but I would have preferred some more broth but overall still good.

Complained to the manger (showing him what I found) & he did not have an explanation as to what it was but did refund my money. Fast forward to May and the same freaking thing happened again!! Only this time the ""parchment paper"" was found in my broccoli and cheddar soup purchased at the Green Acres location, in Valleystream!! WTH is going on??? Is anyone else finding paper in their soup??? I'm calling to submit a complaint tomorrow and will unfortunately have to stop patronizing Panera Bread until I get some answers. SMH I am extremely disappointed because I love their soups."

One day I get the pick 2 and get lucky with a full size sandwich, another time It's tiny and get a tiny piece of bread as my side. Other than that I love panera bread especially the bbq chicken mac and cheese and grilled chicken panini. Always clean and decently friendly service.They have 4 quick service electronic kiosks. Sometimes half of them don't work or you put the order all the way through and then you swipe your card 500 times only for the payment to not go through. Then you just wasted your time and have to wait in line for the cashier. Gets super busy after school, lots of people doing homework."

I check my food & the ingredients had fallen off. I had to basically remake my sandwich. As you can see by the picture, the avocado wasn't even spread across the bread. I rarely visit Panera, now I know why."

Not just because of how fast and easy it is, but also I can customize my order and save it for next time! I have a Panera card, but actually you can just go to the Kiosk and swipe your debit/credit card and it will remember who you are. No need to sign in! I'm starting to sound like a spokesperson, but I swear this has to be the best kiosk of any place I've been to.Anyway, on to the food. I really enjoy getting the chicken panini, and I load it up with tons of good veggies and chipotle sauce :) My girlfriend gets the Southwest Chili Lime salad, and she thinks the avocado/lime combo really brings it together well.Overall, great food at Panera, quality bread. And their Triple Chocolate (Gluten Free) cookie is the best cookie I've ever had. It's as chewy and chocolatey as a brownie. Although, be sure to get it before they run out because these suckers always go fast."
1803,dYfJqwaQ0Z-7bPVveG1iQg,2/1/2020,3 star rating,Food is good.They have a sign up that says you have to go on line for the rapid pick-up--that defeats the purpose of rapid pick up. I had to wait 5-7 minutes to get my bag that was already paid for.

Three stars is slightly generous while two is not sufficient. This is one of those situations.I came here for lunch and decided on a salad. My daughter and I both ordered the Asian Sesame Salad. I got a sad looking apple and she got potato chips. My major complaint is that there seems to be no control over the quantities of the components in the salad. The lettuce was fresh, and the dressing was just the right amount. It had a wonderful Asian flavor. The Chinese noodles added a wonderful crunch and the slivered almonds were a nice touch. My major complaint is that there seems to be no control over the quantities of the components in the salad. The chicken, which was flavorful was abundant in my salad and almost nonexistent in my daughters! Somewhere between my salad and hers would have satisfied both our appetites. I really did not mind giving a some of mine but that should not be necessary.So I give the 3 stars for the taste of the salad but need to bring it down a notch for the inconsistency."

I love panera in general but this is the closest to my house and I've always found everything to be super fresh and all of the workers super friendly. This time I got Greek salad with an Italian sandwich (pick two) and my cousin got half a Mac and cheese. I also got a chocolate chip cookie (not pictures lol). If you use your panera card you get points towards amazing prizes (money off your meal, free ""dessert""/sweet etc)."

It's in KTOWN though, so there are barely any sushi places in the area.I ordered two rolls and both tasted really fresh and I really enjoyed the spicy tuna roll. It was packed in with tuna and in a way that made it taste so good!The prices are average and the food is good, so I think it's worth it!

Our waiter also made my boyfriend a little uncomfortable when I chose to pay for the meal and he kept asking why he wasn't paying for me and directly handed him the bill rather than me. Hopefully the fish was just a bad batch because the food was pretty good I just won't be risking it again"

You won't think much of this place when you walk in, you may even question why you came in, but oh that fish is so fresh. Edamame, shumai, yellowtail jalapeno and the wonderful rolls.

Anyhow, the tostada salad bowl that I ordered for today was enjoyed by my husband. It is a healthy serving,something different from a regular Mexican salad bowl - no rice as part of the ingredients and taste was just right. A little pricey .The place was quiet , no client much at the time of visit and under renovation . Location is accessible , lots of parking space . Could come back for just take out order , not dine in."
1817,elYM_Q52kprd1DYN3ty3rA,5/6/2014,4 star rating,"When the line at Chipotle is a 45-minute wait, sometimes you have to settle for a smaller local tex-mex place like Taco King. (Interestingly enough, the business is run by Asians.) It's cheap, fast, and healthier than Taco Bell. Large portions, too! Personally, I really like their combo that comes with steak, guacamole, rice, and beans. The homemade hot sauce they have in bottles at the counter is too watered down and vinegary, though. True rating would be a 3.5,  not a 4."
1818,elYM_Q52kprd1DYN3ty3rA,3/19/2015,4 star rating,First of all its freezing inside restaurant.   It has about 10 tables for customers to sit.  It's more of a takeout restaurant.  Not a restaurant you would want to have a romantic date on.   It is pretty close to lij hospital.  I love Mexican food so I would go here again
1819,elYM_Q52kprd1DYN3ty3rA,8/22/2015,1 star rating,"There personality still sucks.  Got food from there for the first time in a long time 2 weeks ago with horrible service.  So I came back tonight not to eat, just to  video record some of there bad habits. They are very unsanitary the way they work.  The man who prepared my food tonight (green shirt) was only wearing one glove however he was using two hands.  His buddy is a rebel and works with no gloves. I am adding a video of these poor unsanitary work habits (to youtube search for - taco king 256-31) because two weeks prior my food was treated with the same unsanitary food preparation. I got sick from the food later on.  When i told  the woman worker who was preparing the food that she was touching my food and that I wanted it made over again. The man with the green shirt in the video laughed then proceeded to put it in the bag then handed it to me. Well this time I got you on video and plan to share it with yelp as well as the department of health and the local news if they are interested. Don't think getting me sick after humoring yourself doesn't come back with repercussion."

I've only had the tacos (both the hard tacos & the soft tacos) and the Mexican rice. The food is always given out fast & is fresh and hot. Even though I've never had any of the other items, they do look good from what I've seen other people order while I'm there. I do agree with what some of the other people on here said, that the staff isn't that pleasant and need to work on their customer service skills. The inside isn't too terrible, just a bit cramped. Despite the staff and the inside, overall the food is good and cheap."

They charge you $1 for using your credit card (which I don't know is legal at all). The meat was worse than Taco Bell and the salsa was definitely Tostitos Brand. One of my hard tacos was half of a shell so I asked for another and he wanted to charge me $0.55 for a full shell when I received half. He wanted to charge me $1.00 for a minuscule side of cheese because my tacos were lacking. Bad attitude and would never go back. This place should stick to Chinese food."
1826,2txI-FAVf7q0SHNPcnjm7Q,1/7/2017,4 star rating,This is my go to place for sushi & hand rolls.They have a lot of business so their food supply don't stay in the kitchen long so everything is fresh.Lunch special is choice of three rolls for $10 which includes salad or soup with our order.Their large platters are big groups are very popular.They also have a Chinese food menu but I have never tried it.There only have a couple of tables for eat in. Decor? Nothing to look at.Parking- I often find metered parking on Roosevelt Ave right in front of the store.
1827,2txI-FAVf7q0SHNPcnjm7Q,5/28/2020,4 star rating,East 21 has quality sushi. They are open for take out and have an extremely affordable lunch special. The fish is good quality for its price point. The chopsticks feel cheap and the wood is blistered. They restaurant also has Chinese food on its menu. I have not had it but I will be ordering from the soon enough to try it!

1830,2txI-FAVf7q0SHNPcnjm7Q,2/23/2017,4 star rating,"Solid ""deliver/takeout"" level, in your PJs, budget sushi. So if you get stuff that's hard to mess up, it'll be pretty good. Like the kani salad rolls (California roll version) i really like. The kani salad on top is spicy btw, catch wypipo by surprise heh. I also liked their Fabulous Roll and their futomaki. The futomaki has egg, cucumber, takuan, avocado, and fake crab--I don't know why there's no kampyo in it!!! That's what makes futomaki so good!!! I forgive tho, and I still get it each time bc it's like a mild, lowkey comfort food for me. Their shrimp lo mein is so good, my fave lo mein around here!!! Greasy as heck sometimes tho...but the shrimp is so juicy. The wonton eggdrop soup is also standard and good. The chicken salad is worth your buck, it's a whole slice of chicken with teriyaki sauce (meh about the sauce) on it, over a bed of ice burg lettuce and some grape tomatoes, comes with house dressing on the side. Some drawbacks: I don't like their tuna in their sushi, it tastes frozen so I avoid it. Their salmon skin is also very fried and mostly burnt. But Im super particular about salmon skin and eat it at every sushi place I go to, so don't mind me. The crab rangoons are mostly hard fried wonton skin, not much insides. Cold sesame noodles are bland and sad. I  don't recommend those.But overall, I come back to order sushi here. If you get some staple faves going, it's awesome and a great local spot to Grubhub from."
1831,2txI-FAVf7q0SHNPcnjm7Q,6/8/2019,2 star rating,"I must preface by saying that I've ordered only once from this restaurant and never eaten in. The delivery was fairly quick, even though I live some distance away. I ordered a sushi roll, which was good, and I would order sushi from them again. I also ordered some standard Chinese items (spareribs, General Tso's, broccoli in garlic sauce), and they were really not good. The ribs were OK, though saucy. In the other items there was very little taste, and the chicken was dry. I hesitate to order Chinese again."
1832,2txI-FAVf7q0SHNPcnjm7Q,8/26/2020,3 star rating,"I wanted to give it a higher review but I couldnt in good honesty. I bought from this location 3 times. Each time, I ordered the same thing, the general tso's combination platter and gyozas. The first time, I was elated, the food was tasty and they gyoza's were incredible. The rice was well cooked with a good amount of flavor. The chicken was moist, decent sized pieces. The second time, not so much happy, the chicken in the general tso's was gummy and some over cooked and hard to chew the rice was still tasty. The 3rd time, was similar to the 2nd time. Chicken was tough, rice didn't taste freshly cooked. The sauce for the General Tso's however is incredible. Yes I know people will say that the sauce is similar everywhere, but its not. You can taste a difference in the sauce here. They deliver which is also good. They have a very vast menu, which can overwhelm you. Would I order again, .......probably not, as the last 2 experiences sealed it for me."
1833,2txI-FAVf7q0SHNPcnjm7Q,5/19/2017,3 star rating,"Decided to try something closer than my regular go to sushi spot, Kumo. East 21 definitely provides an assortment of sushi & sashimi along with other Asian delicacies. As my starter I began with their rock shrimp. Ever since I went to Ginza Japanese Restaurant in midtown, I've been addicted to rock shrimp. East 21 provides a different variation of the rock shrimp than I'm used to. Rather than having the sauce marinated and cooked onto the shrimp, they keep it as a dipping sauce with fried shrimp. It was honestly mediocre for my taste. As for my entree I went with the tuna Naruto roll and the Philadelphia roll. I have no problem with the Philly roll except the size of the sushi. Probably the tiniest sushi I have seen but definitely a great taste. The Naruto roll was a delight. A sushi made of cucumber rather than rice. Truly was amazing!I think they can re-adjust their prices on some of the items but overall you're basically paying to eat good sushi. If you're looking for fast delivery service then this is your spot!"
1834,2txI-FAVf7q0SHNPcnjm7Q,1/4/2017,5 star rating,We ordered from this place to try it out for takeout since we had a coupon. We got the 3 roll combos and bento boxes. The food came in big portions and was very filling. It was also delicious. We definitely ordered from here again.
1835,2txI-FAVf7q0SHNPcnjm7Q,12/18/2016,3 star rating,I ordered Salmon teriyaki deluxe platter and it was good. Another thing i ordered shrimp with lobster combination and specifically requested with no onions on the fried rice and i saw onions which disappointed me so much. I also used to love their sesame chicken nuggets but when i received the order some where cooked and some where half cook which its hard to be eaten.I hope you will improve the quality of how you cooked your chicken and don't give half cook chicken to your customers.

1837,wTCR-EUTLX4UoPUPdxWVJg,7/12/2017,1 star rating,"I am surprised to see mostly positive reviews here. My first visit must have been on a seriously ""off"" night.We entered and sat at a table. The waitress came only to tell us that we had to come to the bar to place food orders. Weird - it looks like a restaurant inside, but if it's cafeteria style, OK... Almost nobody in the place at 11pm on a Tuesday.  Of those who were there, the only person we saw eating had oysters; so why did it take 45 minutes for our simple food orders to reach our table?Finally the plate was audibly dropped before me.The tartare was served as a palm-sized lump that looked like it was tapped out of a tin of cat food onto a large plate unceremoniously covered in Ruffles Ridges potato chips. A few cornichons were hidden underneath and made the chips wet. It looked really unappetizing and tasted as bad as it looked - but I was ravenous and ate what was offered; perhaps a risky move with raw meat.My French friend had a sip of the house wine and, perfectly summarizing the experience, said, ""This is the house wine? Then it must be a bad house."" At no point did the waitress visit the table. No water. No napkins. No service.Americans in the service industry feel they deserve a tip regardless of their performance. I have worked in the service industry, do not agree with that philosophy, and tipped accordingly. After leaving, the waitress, or one of the drunken friends with whom she was consorting outside throughout the evening, shouted angrily and unintelligibly after us. See ya, Pinkerton's. It's been real. There are WAAAY too many options for a pleasant night out in this neighborhood."
1838,wTCR-EUTLX4UoPUPdxWVJg,4/6/2017,4 star rating,"This is a great wine bar for snagging a quick drink before dinner or taking a date. They have a happy hour wherein it's the same price to get a half dozen oysters ($6) as two oysters ($6), so I'd take advantage of that. There's a nice selection of reasonably-priced wines and the waiters/bartenders know their stuff well enough to make me think they know their stuff well enough to recommend things.It's dimly lit in a romantic sort of way. The entrance is caddy-corner to the street which really bothers me and I believe is architecturally incorrect (source: Kramer on Seinfeld), but I'll give them a pass for the great deals and nice ambiance inside."

1843,wTCR-EUTLX4UoPUPdxWVJg,10/7/2014,5 star rating,"Favorite wine bar in Williamsburg. They strike the best balance of all important things in a bar. -Good ambiance. Cozy, kitschy, great paintings. Not sterile. -Good prices. Most wines are between $7-11 a glass.-Good rotating selection of all different kinds of wine, new and old world.-Meat and cheese plates that are not crazy expensive.-Nice outdoor seating. -Good music. -Never insanely loud or busy. -Not pretentious -Really good happy hour! $5 house red and white wines. $20 bottles. $4 pilsner and $14 pitcher. 5-8pm every day, even weekends.They also have been featuring cool chef pop-up dinners on certain nights with really good food if you're looking for something more substantial than meat and cheese. It's been a staple in my bar repertoire for 3+ years now and I hope they stand the test of time in this tough neighborhood. Pinkerton is a gem!"
1844,wTCR-EUTLX4UoPUPdxWVJg,5/17/2018,4 star rating,"This place is my go-to for wine on Friday afternoons. They do not have kitchen, so their food menu is not extensive (oysters, hummus/pita, prosciutto), I'd suggest planning to eat either before or after. Come for a bottle of wine (or 2, the prices are very affordable),they have beer as well. How To Get There: very accessible and safe through public transportation. Ambiance: mainly locals that enjoy talking to other groups in their outdoor/front area. I cant speak for the inside, but I hear its pretty cool too. Suggestions: a bottle of rose on a summer/spring afternoon and order the grilled cheese- who does love a grilled cheese!"

The bar is well tended; friendly and courteous, offering samples of wine before I was willing to make a commitment. I enjoyed being in a quiet neighborhood bar over the hustle and bustle of anything just a block away where loud bars with loud music and loud patrons provide everything that I hate about the city. What a comfort this place is - and perfectly situated across the street from Pates et Traditions where you can enjoy a full meal or just dessert before or after a visit to Pinkerton.Next time I come, I'm getting the $1 oysters!

1846,bCNUrWXHB96NFcCgODGd9Q,4/5/2018,4 star rating,I eat here a lot... I've seen a lot of complaints about the service but basically you order your food at the counter and they bring it to you. Service is much better here than he majority of NY establishments. I've tried everything from los tres golpes to pernil to oxtail to the salted codfish salad and it's all delicious. Tons of flavor -- traditional Dominican food. I'm not Dominican but they sure treat me like family. Definitely check it out!
1847,bCNUrWXHB96NFcCgODGd9Q,1/15/2017,2 star rating,I've visited this place with my sister. It's was her selection. I ordered some yellow rice w/pepper steak and red beans and she ordered yellow rice w/ beef stew and red beans. The food was warm at best. Wasn't hot as I desired it to be. The waitress was kind. She showed me what side I wanted with my food in regards to the meat selection. It's was a quiet environment but the football game was on. They have a great selection of food for a reasonable price range. The cashier was basically trying to tip herself by taking $2. That and the warm food; but mainly the cashier trying to tip her self gives this place two stars. Maybe my next visit the stars can go higher.

I stayed only because I had herd such great things about this place, boy did my friends lie. When I finally got a menu and attempted to place an order they didn't have half of the things on the menu. Eventually my fiance got a t-bone steak with white rice and beans, I ordered there beef stew with white rice and sweet plantains. The sweet plantains and the beans came out ICE COLD and when we brought this to the waitress attention she said she could microwave them.... WFT? The beef stew was vinegarie, and bland. The meat was tough, and just gross. The only bright side was that it wasn't salty. My fiance steack, which was ordered well done, came out extremely bloody and also wasn't seasoned. I ended up not eating my food and would never come back here again. In all fairness I lived in Washington hights for 3 years and I truly love good Spanish food, so I set the bar pretty high, but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
1849,bCNUrWXHB96NFcCgODGd9Q,3/18/2018,3 star rating,I bought salted fish salad and it is spoiled. It gave me a stomachache. They should check their food before they sell it. But they have very good Cuban sandwich and fried pork belly.

I come in here always getting either the yellow rice, or bean with rice then either some crab salad, beef stew, grilled chicken, and/or pork are all amazing! Didn't think the island would have such decent food right? But your wrong! Also must try their cream milk cake! You can't leave here without dessert! It's taste so smooth and creamy! It glides right into your mouth! Such satisfying food!"

Living and working in the area I have gone there multiple times and everytime I leave I say never again. They ignore you while serving all the people who speak Spanish, then give you the stink face while serving you speaking Spanish to their co-workers obviously about you. Then they give you a plate half the size (and full of all the fatty pieces) that they just gave the guy that spoke Spanish when you ordered the same thing. But the best part is hearing them say Cabrone(dont speak Spanish but know enough that that word is an insult) under their breathe when you dont leave them a tip. Go to El Pollo or M&K both are nicer and have better food"

It's currently take-out only and you order at the window.It gives me a warm feeling seeing someone sitting inside putting filling in wonton wrappers and making wontons. There's just an authentic feeling to it that makes me feel good and excited about what I'm about to eat. I ordered the #6 spicy wontons ($10) which has no soup and instead has spicy toppings. The wontons were soft, flavorful, and they were bigger than they looked.If you're looking for a table or a place to sit, there are tables in the park past the basketball courts or you can also go to New World Mall a couple blocks away."
1858,pTZp1Lhdptd9b2HnIej6dg,9/10/2022,3 star rating,"Let me start by saying that I was really hoping to love this place. You can literally see them making the dumplings completely fresh. it's a small window so there's nowhere to sit and you have to do takeout. We ordered the two most popular dishes of the Dan Dan noodles and the wontons in spicy oil (17 and 6).  Also- note that this is Cash Only!!!!Overall, the wontons themselves were super meaty and delicious. However, the spicy oil sauce left me wanting so many more flavors. I expected this to be worlds above DTF and it was not.  It sounds like there is a general consensus that this place was significantly better years ago. I'm not sure what has changed, but clearly their quality has declined for whatever reason. I'd recommend grabbing one order of the wontons to try if you must, but save some room for all of the other wonderful and higher- quality for high value food in Flushing."

Got the spicy wontons (#6)--a sizable amount for only $10 that fed both my friend and me as a light meal/snack. The chili oil was a little lacking so the dish wasn't spicy at all, but the wontons had a generous amount of filling and were delicious! I also recommend getting their frozen wontons and dumplings, which are $25 for 50."

Which is fine - the food was fantastic!The dumplings are what everyone wants to try and what they come for. They make them per order so it usually takes around 10 mins to prep on their end. We placed two orders and they didn't have enough so we saw the dumplings come from a packaged freezer bag to cook for our order. Overall had amazing flavor and was both satisfying and filling for me.

The texture of the wontons and the dan dan noodles were there, but the taste was not it. I had anticipated a spicy with sweet and salty flavor but what I got was pure saltiness. My friend and I had to drink water multiple times to get rid of the salt in our mouth.Not sure if we caught them at a bad day or something because I was really looking forward to this place. It wasn't even busy the day we went and we went early, like probably an hour after they opened. We even saw them making it and was super hyped to try it. Probably one of the worst food I ate in NYC, and I feel bad having to say it."

I've always passed by this place, but since they do not have seating, I haven't tried it. The wontons in spicy oil were delicious! The sauce was so good and the wontons were a good combination of wonton wrapper to meat filling. I definitely thought it could be spicier and was expecting it to leave a tingling sensation on my tongue, but it was absolutely not spicy. Would love to try the other items on the menu at White Bear!"

Came here for lunch and got a few lunch items to try, which come with a small salad and small appetizer of your choice. Pad thai is on point, definitely Thai (not Chinese style Thai if you know what I mean). The curry is pleasant and enjoyable, just so good with jasmin rice. All the appetizers are so delicous and presented so well, I love how they focused on presentation on even on the smallest thing, it simply makes your dining experience much better.Lunch time during the week was nice, not crowded so get to enjoy the food and ambiance. Staff is very nice and helpful. I'd definitely love to come back again!"
1867,bCNUrWXHB96NFcCgODGd9Q,4/1/2022,2 star rating,"Hate to say I was quite disappointed. The food presentation is top notch but the dishes are somehow missing something or are off balance. Peaflower lemonade: Only order this drink if you want an Instagram photo that attracts likes, otherwise, skip it. My boyfriend (huge sweet tooth) and I both agree the drink is overwhelming sweet and is off balance. The drink is no different than lemonade from a food stand. Oh fun fact- the drink will turn from deep blue to vibrant purple after you stir it as pea flower changes color with acidic ingredient (lemon juice). Make sure to stir your drink before your first sip and you will see the color changes. Larb tuna tartare - way too sour. I don't like the little crunchy thing either. Not a big fan. Salmon stone clay - the only dish I enjoyed. Rice at the bottom is crispy and very flavorful. Salmon is nicely cooked and seasoned. Only issue is there is no vegetables in this dish. Perhaps, you can order a veggie as your side Giant river prawn green curry - the curry is way too sweet and lack of flavor. Giant pawn itself is delicious and almost resembles lobster! However, there isn't too much meat (two bites max). The bread came with this dish is not great either. My boyfriend was hungry after this. Thai tea crepe and ice cream - Thai tea ice cream is delicious! Not too sweet but has great flavor. You can taste the tea. However, the texture of the crepe is off. Maybe the cream to crepe ratio is off? The picture looks better than food itself. Overall, food was very slow but service was good. It is byob right now which is nice. I probably won't come back in a while to try other food unless I feel the urge of posting photos on Instagram."

Even their cutlery and tableware is imported from Thailand! The interior is adorable and cozy with tons of plants.The service was immaculate. 11/10! The girls who worked here were the most accommodating staff I've ever met. They're so bubbly and cheerful. They always made sure my table had everything we needed.We ordered:Quail egg wontons ($9)Thai Herbed chicken ($13)Chicken Satay ($12)Kua Gai ($17)Colossal Crab meat fried rice ($28)Massaman chicken curry ($14)Steak stone pot ($25)Drinks:Lychee Thai iced tea ($5)Thai ice green tea ($5)Butterfly pea lemonade ($5)Pink milk ($5)The quail egg wonton is my absolute favorite! Tastes exactly like what I remembered from Thailand. The Thai herbed chicken had a very crispy skin and the spices were very apparent but sadly, I thought it was a little dry.If there's any entrees you must try, it is the massaman curry and the steak stone pot! I'm not usually the one to order curry but omg, the massaman curry was so delicious! I love the sweetness that the coconut milk added. The steak stone pot is pretty spicy but the FLAVORS !! THE SPICES !! It's a must! The Kua Gai tasted like a standard Thai noodle dish with a peanut flavor with it. Nothing outstanding but definitely a classic. The colossal crab meat fried rice is also amazing! They include huge chunks of crab meat.The best drink in my opinion was the lychee Thai tea and the Thai tea green tea! Please pass on the pink milk.  It tastes like pepto bismol. LOLThey have a free complimentary dessert for your birthday! We were about to leave before they insisted we must sit down. They surprised my friend with fried icecream with a firecracker candle on it!This restaurant seriously has my heart. Literally the sweetest staff and equally amazing authentic Thai dishes!

Wish I had a bigger stomach to try everything here, so I would recommend going with a group to be able to try more items. They have a section on their menu for grandma's special dishes which featured unique dishes I haven't seen on other thai menus. Would definitely come back to try those and the desserts. I would recommend the drunken noodle, spring rolls, tea leaves salad, roti massman, and green curry. Everything was very flavorful and cooked well. The massaman roti and tea leaves salad is a must! I would avoid the stone pot steak which was a bit too salty."

What's not great, however, is that all of the stir fries have oyster or fish sauce in them and cannot be made vegan or even vegetarian. This is ironic for a restaurant which otherwise does such a good job of providing vegan and GF options. It's also utterly unnecessary, as most Asian restaurants which aren't even trying to cater to vegans don't use oystet/fish sauce in their stir fries."

But that is exactly what they had. We could not hear ourselves think and could not carry on a conversation.Second the food. Tuna tartar was excellent, fries were good but ridiculously expensive, and the bone marrow was mostly bone, and hardly any marrow! Finally, their by the glass menu did not have two of the offerings per their site.In general, a waste of time, and at $140 for one drink each and the three food items above, a waste of money.

Called and they were fully booked. Luckily, I asked a couple more questions about walk ins and they do take walk ins in the bar area and mezzanine. Mezzanine has no view of the stage but you could hear the beautiful singing floating up as you enjoy your cocktail. As soon as we walked in, I was like wow!  Lights were dimmed. Everything was a dark red, beautiful flower arrangements, liquor bottles lined the wall, and after sitting down, the jazz band started and then it dawned on me how lucky we are to live in NYC to have access to all these different venues.  I love these new  experiences.  The music was so nice. It was a 3 person band with a pianist, cellist and a female singer with such a beautiful voice. There is a balcony on the mezzanine that gives you a great view of the band. You can stand there and enjoy the music. This was a last minute decision so I felt fortunate enough to get a table to enjoy the ambience but now that I know about this venue, next time I will book ahead of time to reserve a table in front of the stage. The music was awesome. Drinks were a little light. No cover charge."

(Miss Mabel and Charlie Judkins, ragtime).The interior was spacious and elegant. The lighting was dim, with flairs of red. For a minute, I felt under-dressed as I took in the atmosphere and saw the staff was dressed in very formal attire (black vests over button down shirts). However, the friendly service and the warm-up house music (good selections by the way) put me at ease.When I at the bar, I was dehydrated and immediately finished my small cup of water. I asked the bartender for a larger glass and a refill, and to my delight, was  given a self-serve glass water bottle. So big points for that.I ordered two cocktails, neither of which tasted strongly of their liquor base (gin and scotch). My favorite drink was the Garden Of Eden #3 (gin base), which had many different elements floating around. It was fun to look and tasted great (not a strong gin taste). I never had a problem with accidentally ingesting the ingredients as I drank.The live music was upbeat and a joy to listen to. Each of the 3 members sounded like true professionals."

The vibe inside was dark with red lighting and tons of drinks.  We tried to stay healthy so basically ate all the ""green things"" on the menu.  They had lots of things I'd have liked to try, like macaroni and cheese and chicken and waffles and tacos but we decided to be healthy because we'd already had pizza. We had the burrata salad served with corn salsa and greens, a fresh fruit salad, and chose the Tuscan Quinoa stack from the menu which was fresh and good.  My fiancee had some bourbon and I had two mocktails which were surprises.  One was spicy and ginger-y and amazing, probably the best one I've ever had.  We heard two bands while here and they were very very good. Prices for drinks and food were fair.  They had some delicious desserts but we abstained since, as before, trying to make decent choices that night.  You can come and enjoy the music at your table while you're eating but they will eventually ask you to leave when you are done as they did with two younger girls beside us when they had finished their dessert. Worth a visit if you are nearby - it was awesome."
1882,pTZp1Lhdptd9b2HnIej6dg,4/1/2023,1 star rating,"Food was downright terrible- even the menu's options seemed like an MBA marketing case study in planting absurd options to deflect you to overpriced-but-sane mediocre options (e.g. as an appetizer, do you want $30 mac and cheese, $30 meat-only charcuterie, $30 cheese-only charcuterie, or $52 meat and cheese mix charcuterie?). The $53 steak frites were dog food quality, overcooked and served sitting in A1 steak sauce. No seasoning or salt. The ambience can be described as a no-man's land midpoint between a dance club with bass heavy music played at deafening volume to complement a band that played no more than 5 minutes before taking a break for the break of the hour plus we were there. If you are expecting a pleasant live music setting, please be warned that it is LOUD whether speakers or musicians are playing and you will not be able to hear yourself talk. Very bizarre decibel level choice on the aux along with poor acoustics overall. The service meant well but managed to mess up our only drink order (came back with the wrong drinks). The servers seemed tense and fed up that everyone only stayed in that unpleasant setting eating mediocre food for long enough to get a check and leave to the comfort of the outdoors."

Around 7:30 on a Friday night, we were welcomed in with no wait. After depositing our coats at the free coat check, the hostess led us to three separate dining options so we could choose our favorite. As walk-ins, we were not offered the ""best"" seats, which were booths and tables on the main floor where you could see the band and be in the center of all the energy. That didn't bother us because we were eventually situated upstairs at the end of the long communal dining table, where we were the only diners. We still had a small view of the band and the amber liquor cabinets that stretch along the far wall. The ambience upstairs was top notch; dimly lit with interesting lighting fixtures and dark wood. The bucket seats in the dining chairs were a bit of a surprise and pretty comfortable.The service was impeccable. Our waiters were patient and friendly and explained drinks and food options to us when we asked. We never felt rushed.My boyfriend and I each ordered two drinks: Garden of Eden, Smoking Old Fashioned, The Apriscot, and The Morning Dram Espresso Martini. Each was delicious! My favorites were the latter two. They were very distinct in flavor and went down easy.We were only there for drinks but decided to splurge on the charcuterie and cheese board combo platter to have something to munch on while we enjoyed the live entertainment. The combo board comes with four different cheeses, four different meats, water biscuits, crusty slices of bread, grapes, a sort of fig spread, and a small bowl of tapenade.I enjoyed the board very much. My only suggestions for the restaurant would be to provide one more type of spread (maybe honey or a Dijon mustard) and provide olives separate from the tapenade. I picked out the green olives from the tapenade and did not enjoy the red peppers, celery, and other pickled components in the bowl.Other than that, we loved our experience here and would definitely try them for a full dinner experience in the future. They're currently participating in restaurant week with an amazing 3-course meal for $59pp with an option to add three cocktails for $45 (which is a great deal because their cocktails are $20-$22 each).They're also having a special for Valentine's Day (pic included), which definitely tempted us to make a reservation."

Our total cost for 2 whole wheat everything bagels with jalopeño tofu cream cheese, onion, tomato, and avocado was $17.50, which seems very steep (adding avocado costs $2.50 - much more than other bagel places I've been to).

These (9.5$) had decent flavor, but the skin on top was too thick.Shengjianbao (9.95$) had great juicy meat, but not enough salt made it a bit too bland. Nice to satisfy a craving though. Hot pot pickled cabbage fish (24.95$) was very flavorful and the fish perfectly tender. The soup spoons were way too thick and large for the bowls, making it oddly difficult to eat soup from the bowl? In comparison to the slightly undersalted xlb and sjb, this was quite salty. The weirdly standout item? The rice that came with the fish! It was very fragrant, noticeably fresh. Overall, the food was decent, but quite pricey. I would probably only go back if I had a craving."
1927,2cqg0qGfC6bEC1AKGazSXg,12/28/2021,5 star rating,"I always think of this place as a hidden jewel because it never seems overly busy and the food is always spot on delicious with reasonable prices, the latter being a rarity in the Chelsea/Flatiron area.The food is Shanghainese, which for most people usually translate to the Chinese food they are used to ... or at least it's close to it. But truth be told traditional Shanghai cuisine is hard to get right, and this place does.It's very mom and pop, which is part of its charm. The older gentleman who seats patrons and takes orders is the owner. His wife, who speaks little to no English, is the head chef. We've been coming here for awhile and the food is always consistently good. And I don't say that often. NYC is infamous for its inconsistencies. The dry pot is a treat. Grandma's dumplings are one of their more sought after and famous dishes. The farmhouse dumplings is a unique dish for the egg lover.Never disappoints."

We wanted to try the fried and steamed (aka grandmas) soup dumplings. When they came to the table, the server said ""these are the best dumplings in Manhattan"". They were good. They were okay. The pan fried dumplings get plump and loose a lot of the soup. Grandmas was more my cup of tea, but wasn't ""amazing"". They were ok. Coming from California, these are just ok. The siao mai were extremely small and flavorless. Highly disappointing. If I go to NYC, We would probably try another spot."

I asked to be seated in the outdoor area, but the waiter told me I would get ""worse service"" likely because it was a bit farther away than the main dining room. I was a little disappointed as we were the only patrons so I didn't think it would have been that big of a deal. Alas, we moved on. The next issue I found was the pricing for the portions. I don't doubt that it's authentic, but the menu is long and the portions are on the smaller side for the price. The server seemed over us from the start, and didn't seem to care for questions LOL.Weird thing: while sitting at the restaurant, I started getting itchy on my legs and found out later that a bug had been biting me... I'm unsure which bug it was because they didn't look like mosquito bites--yikes!Overall, not the best experience. The food was quite average and a friend of mine mentioned that the egg tarts (one of her all-time favorite desserts) tasted store-bought/not super fresh."

They cut that in half to appear more, but it was a sad over fried over greased with bean paste that's barely there. I had high expectations for their signature bao but not only it's tiny, with a size that's slightly bigger than the soup spoon and with meat that's barely there. The size should be twice as big with meat stuffed the whole thing. I definitely feel cheated on. I should have known due to its location. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
1931,2cqg0qGfC6bEC1AKGazSXg,10/19/2021,5 star rating,Found this place on yelp when I was craving chinese food in flatiron (and was too lazy to go down to chinatown). Everything we tried was amazing and so delicious. I found it to be a bit pricey but no complaints at all with the food.Peking duck bao / peking duck burger - This was so yummy and I would highly recommend it! The duck was very flavorful and the bao was so soft and fluffy.Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings) - a classic dish that was super tasty. Skin wasn't too thick and the soup inside was flavorful.Fish Hot Pot - I would recommend this if you like fish! It had great spices and they even serve it on top of a hot flame so that the dish stays hot throughout your whole meal.Come Again? If I was in the area and wanted good chinese food I would come again! I came for dinner and saw that they had lunch specials so maybe I will try some lunch specials next time. It is a bit pricey but it definitely hit the spot for me.

Most definitely will be back again when I'm near the park. Can't wait to try their food next time!

1939,L9n68f-cdk7RMQvRJvC6bA,2/15/2019,5 star rating,"Cute cozy cafe around a 5-10 minute walk from the Astoria Blvd station. Ive had the americano and turmeric latte from here, and found them to be average. However, the show stopper is their milk tea ($4.75). Holy moley i stopped what i was doing just to hype this drink UP!!! I usually stay away from Taro- most of the time i cant taste the difference from regular milk tea... and it normally comes in an exaggerated purple color so that turns me off. However, similar to TenRen, it tastes like actual tea without that weird flowery aftertaste that places like Vivis and kung fu usually have. You can also pick your Sweetness level and sub out milk for alternative at a price. The honey boba (+$0.50) is the P E R F E C T texture- it's probably one of the best I've ever had.They also sell Lady M original crepe cakes for $8 and matcha for $8.50. Their selection of pastries look delicious- matcha creme puffs, almond and chocolate crossiants.... *~*~DroolBathroom is clean, the wifi is free, and the barista was nice!

I'm originally from SoCal (specifically the San Gabriel Valley - if you know, you know) so I'm very picky about boba but Infinitea lives up to my expectations!I've only been here once (so far) but I loved the rose milk tea.

In addition to their coffees and teas, they have fruit teas and bubble tea options as well as jelly. They're a coffee shop & bubble tea wrapped into one, in a low key, classy environment.They have nice tables and seating, wifi, and I think it's a fun touch that they have their milks at the bar in swell bottles! What a creative idea. It's also really fun to be able to see them making their cold brew in this nifty lab setup right in the middle of the shop. I've loved every drink I've gotten here, so far.I haven't had any of their food but anticipate I will try it soon during a study session or something."
1945,L9n68f-cdk7RMQvRJvC6bA,12/27/2018,4 star rating,"Yet ANOTHER win for Astoria!!! Seriously this area is littered with cafes serving outstanding coffee and bubble tea, unlike anywhere else in NYC. Plus, more importantly, their cafe logo is neko cat (pretty much the original reason I needed to visit here....I'm simple like that haha) ^^I love the contrast of the interior and exterior of the cafe. The outside is very inconspicuous, but the inside design is very well developed and quietly sophisticated. The cafe is only small but there's enough seating for about 12 people, so it's good for individuals/couples or small groups. I can't recommend this to families or people with babies in strollers. This cafe does have wifi and a restroom too.They provide a small selection of food to order and pastries in addition to their beverages. We had ordered the chocolate poppy and almond croissant which were both enjoyable. Pricing was standard for the pastries (around $3) and drinks (around $5).For the drinks, we had ordered their Jasmine milk tea w/honey bubbles, rose milk tea w/ skim milk and honey bubbles and their Taro w/ skim milk and honey bubbles. Like many others have commented, the sago was perfect, slightly sweet and squishy with just a touch more firmness towards the centre. I love that their rose milk tea was garnished with fragmented rose petals, this is the first cafe I've seen them do that. I also really appreciate that they include skim milk as a milk option, it's been the only place to do it as far as what I've experienced.As a standard rule, I prefer skim milk but it really is better to order the milk teas prepared as standard since the substitute dulls the overall taste. I'd recommend keeping the standard sweetness levels too, we opted for 25% sweetness and it made the teas too bland, the Taro especially. The floral notes of the rose milk tea prevailed though, which I was impressed with. The jasmine milk tea was a delight too, one of their best sellers.They've also got the cutest 'self-serve' area for your milks and sweeteners. There was even a vanilla sugar syrup with REAL vanilla bean pods!!! (These babies are expensive at the supermarket, so I was surprised they supplied it) :D"

1948,YzyHW3w0HUyaG8EvplNT1A,1/25/2022,1 star rating,On Saturday January 22 my husband and I went in looking for a cake for our daughter's second birthday.  There was a young man behind the counter so we asked him if he could help us in ordering a simple custom cake for her birthday.  Since we needed it done in two weeks he just scoffed as if to say that's too short of a time.  When we explained that it was a very simple small cake he didn't say anything.  So we asked about flavors and fillings and he pointed to the display of cake slices and said that's what we have.  None of the slices had a description so we asked again if there was a book or list we can look at and he once again pointed to the display and said that's what we have.  I wish we had spoken to somebody else who could've actually helped us even if to say that two weeks wasn't enough.  He acted too pretentious and had an attitude of either you know what you want or you can leave.  We definitely won't be going back there again.  I'm still confused as to what the process is in placing a custom cake since he gave us zero information.

The strawberries are fresh and delicious! The cake was moist. The strawberry filling is fresh too. The custard is creamy. The frosting is very, very sweet! I could only handle one piece of this cake. Very good!! Want to try their carrot cake now that I've heard about it. Will update soon...."

I have been coming here for about 8 years, during which time I have gone out of my way to spend a good bit of hard earned money at this business for birthdays, special occasions, cravings, and normal needs. Today I was excited to pick up some dessert for our first family function after the COVID situation, I was exited to visit this business specifically.When I walked in I was told to wait, the person I waited 5 minutes for felt as if I was a waste of their time.  I had her rolling eyes and yelling at me to speak up. It was daunting, intimidating, unfriendly, not at all what I expected, and a horrible experience.  I don't care how these cookies and pastries will taste, I will never come back here nor will I recommend this place based on how rude my service was today. They ruined my 8 years of fond memories of this place in just 10 minutes. I used to tell my friends and family in the neighborhood to go there. Not anymore.The only reason this is not a one star review is because I can't lie, I've been coming here for years and the products are solid and the service used to be awesome.  But today was not it."

The food was drowned in canned gravy and the grilled chicken was burnt. To make matters worse, we waited 45 minutes into my 55 minute lunch. I was so disappointed. It's a shame this establishment feels like they need to serve hot food when they are known for their carrot cake and baked goods."
1952,YzyHW3w0HUyaG8EvplNT1A,2/8/2022,3 star rating,I had the carrot cake. It was kind of dry. Not much to rave about. It was a let down because I'd heard the carrot cake was good. The employee who served me was very nice.

Is BEAUTIFULIT has chocolate mousse, instead of cream cheese frosting, but it proves that carrot cakes can go with anything. It can probably be used as a burger bun if you ask me. Their cannolis are just. Mozart. Which is love. My friend was saying maybe she's at the age where she loves cannolis, but carrot top had revived that love. Also coffee is great with any and alll the sweets  (I miss gabi (gabby?) who was so sweet every time she was there, she made my day)"

They said the carrot muffins were great, I had an hour break and was filming outside all day, so I figured I'd check it out.Had a good cup of coffee and the carrot muffin, but the muffin was a little dry. Maybe they're better right out of the oven, but since it's their signature food, I think I had one that was sitting out for awhile or just over baked.The staff was very nice and I was in there for a little over an hour and they didn't say anything/ give any looks."

1956,YzyHW3w0HUyaG8EvplNT1A,5/30/2009,4 star rating,"I went here once a couple months ago while on vaca. I took one look at the breaded chicken breast and said ""I need that. Now."" I got it between two pieces of french bread with French dressing. That's all. I'm boring. But somehow this sandwich was so freaking good. The chicken was perfectly seasoned, perfect temperature and so tender. Pair that with a tasty bag of Dirty's Garlic and Herb chips along with a Cherry Pepsi and you've got a meal. It only cost about $10 for all that, which is a steal in NY in my opinion. The atmosphere was cute; a little ledge for you to stand at to eat. Nothing fancy, just quick, delicious food."

They have never made a mistake, never been late, never forgotten anything. It's a basic sandwich shop, nothing fancy, but they're completely reliable, and that's a rare and precious thing to find in a caterer. ""Mr. Min"" - the owner or manager - is the best; I always put my orders in with him directly. He embodies a level of customer service that you rarely find in this country (particularly in this neighborhood!) unfailingly kind, patient, gracious, and truly a joy to interact with - he's the reason we keep coming back."

Not only is it the closest to my office, but it also has decent food that's reasonably priced.I usually go with one of their sandwiches. The prepared meals are relatively cheap and the portions are quite large but they are usually a bit oily/greasy for my taste. You pay per ingredient for the build-your-own salads which adds up quickly unless you skip the protein.The staff is courteous and efficient and even if the place is packed, you can get in and out within 5 minutes."

She was looking for the spoon to make the carvelanche. Finally it was found, i asked her to use fresh ice cream since mine was now melted. She should have done that without me telling her.

The ice cream cakes are placed in the center of the store.  There are a few tables if you're going to be bringing your family and friends to hang out on a hot summer day or during the winter, it's never too cold for ice cream!They have special sometimes, like Wednesdays buy one pint of low fat ice cream get one free.  Deals might change every so often.Master and Visa only, no Amex cards are accepted.Staff is fast, friendly and efficient.  Parking in the rear of the building."

My kid and I both settled on whatever we happened to be looking at when he asked what we wanted a second time. I ordered the Italian omelette with home fries, and a side of turkey sausage. My kid ordered a cheese omelet and when we asked for hash browns  the guy looked like he wanted to lose it.

They talked me through a few dishes due to my nut allergy. And as our food was ready, the gentleman brought it outside for us, and thanked us so genuinely. The drunken noodles with veggies was so colorful and flavorful. The pad see ew with tofu was just what I needed. And finished off with the mango sticky rice which was a delight."

The Pad See Ew and Drunken Noodles never fail to disappoint-- no matter what protein you choose to add in! Speaking of protein, the wide array of choices Savory Thai provides you with is absolutely commendable. Something for everyone, regardless of diet. Their appetizers are also most definitely worth checking out if you're on the hungrier side! We've tried quite a few, and you really can't go wrong. That being said, my favorites would be the spring rolls, vegetable dumplings, and calamari (great sauce)! If you want to feel a little bit of comfort on your tongue, go try Savory Thai!"

I use to get this delivered like a moron then I realized this place was only a 2 minute walk from my apartment.I am a huge fan of the crispy chicken and rice. The chicken cutlet they use is really flavorful and they give you a generous amount of chicken too. The rice has veggies in it too and its super fresh and nice. They also have this sweet chili sauce which is absolutely amazing I drizzle that stuff all over the chicken cutlets and the rice. My only initial complaint was that they dont give you a lot of the sauce. On my next order I let them know how much I loved that sweet chili goodness and how I would day dream taking baths in it, and would appreciate if I could have a little more. I bought a tea and said if it costs extra just use the money from the tea and were cool. The sauce was free plus they gave me two teas, one for my and one for my girlfriend.Service like this wins my business for life. I havent had anything else from here, but definitely planning on it and pumped I found this spot.Theres like maybe 8 seats in the small restaurant too so this isnt really a big family dinner spot but could be a nice cozy datenight spot."

It asks you for your zip code before the locations are listed. The closest one usually pops up at the top of the list, so I just picked that while also trying to multi-task and get work done. I do admit, I should have taken a closer look, but I've never had an issue after putting my zip code in! Well, I got the confirmation email and opened it up right away and noticed I picked Murray Hill instead of Flatiron. I then immediately called the number listed, but you get a recording -- you can't reach anyone! And if you have a question or issue with an order, you have to text them, which I did right away. I explained my mistake and asked if they could switch the order to Flatiron. After several minutes they said they could not, because the order had already been prepared. I explained that I would not be able to pick it up at that location, as I could not leave work for that amount of time. They then offered me a $5 credit towards my next order. Really?? What a joke! I get that it was my fault, but mistakes happen, and I did try to call right away! If it was possible to reach the location directly, I would have been able to tell them right away not to prepare it. I was shocked they wouldn't offer a refund OR as a courtesy have the Flatiron location make the salad. Think about how much food gets wasted at the end of the night that they have to throw away. They couldn't spare a few more ingredients and have the order made at Flatiron? Even Amazon will replace your whole freaking order if there is any kind of issue with it.

I got a customized poke bowl, and they gave me a laminated order form. By the way, they store those forms and markers in a UV sanitization machine! The store was so bright and clean, and the workers were friendly and we got our food pretty fast. The price of the poke bowl was very fair, and it came with miso soup! The two other poke shops in the area couldn't do what they do. (I'm talking about Pokeworks--overpriced and stingy and it's a chain, so support Trutea!) The miso soup was a perfect complement and a great palate cleanser. The salmon and tuna in the poke bowl were incredibly fresh and all the ingredients were given in very generous portions. They bagged the food nicely and the utensils they gave were packaged and sanitary. I can't say enough good things about this place! Best poke spot in the area. Can't wait to come back. :)"

I can't believe I've never ordered this before. It comes with a coffee plastic cap where you can still stick the big bubble straw through it. As always I cut down to 50% sugar bc 100% it's too sweet.They also sell macarons, asian snacks, and HK waffle cone with icecream. Still haven't tried the HK waffles cookies yet.$5 minimum for cc."

If I'm not mistaken, the only other place that serves boba is Hanco's the Bánh Mì joint on Smith Street. Coming from SoCal, I had a hard time adjusting to the mediocre boba spots in New York. However, in my opinion, KFT is the only spot that seems to be consistent throughout its chains. This spot is close to the Fulton Mall and near many of the areas trains. An easy stop before heading home, I usually pick up the honey black tea or the early grey tea both with bubbles. They soak the boba in honey (or sugar) and they have nice bouncy texture, not too mushy and not too hard. The only reason I am knocking off .5 a point is because the staff isn't welcoming or the friendliest."

All the tea is always consistent and blows away all other competition. 100% hands down the best customer service. I was about to get a parking ticket they were so nice and even told me to get into the car so I don't get a ticket and they'd bring it out to me.

He/she needs to step up and restock it properly. A few weeks ago, I asked what happened to the fun cocktail menu and was told it was gone. I asked what kind of red wine they had by the glass and they said they were out of red. I accepted white. When I tried to order a second glass of white, they were out of that, so I accepted a beer. Kind of hilarious.Same thing happened last night. No red wine. They poured the white out of a cardboard box, and it was terrible.The atmosphere is great if that's all you want. Go, enjoy, have a beer (if they don't run out of that too). Is it so hard to offer interesting cocktails and keep a few bottles of wine on hand? If the owner will do this, I will happily delete this review. Until then, they should tell customers to bring their own booze."

If I time traveled from the 1800's, I'd probably dig a place like this.The antique chandelier is gorgeous and a nice piece to stare off to.It's fun to bounce from here from Earl's after some casual eats and beer to something a little more upscale, but still mildly casual if necessary (you can barely seem anyways..).It's in a strange location, but ideal for the Mount Sinai crowd.Charming - I give it a 4."

The ambiance is relaxed and low stress with still a prohibition Era vibe. The staff are fantastic and give a generous pour. This is a great place for a chill night out where you really want to catch up with an old friend and have a great couple of drinks. It doesn't have delicious food and wine like abv. It doesn't have the comfort factor of savory beer cheese and microbrewery beers. But that's not what it's meant to be. It terrific for what it is.

The variety of beers on tap is very limited but sometimes that is a good thing. Choice can be overwhelming and this place just simplifies the whole process. Just what you need after a demanding day at the grindstone! The venue is bijoux but the cosiness cannot be hidden and the bar staff seem to always be playing the BEST tunes!! Happy hour is between 5-7 and this is the prime time to hit the Guthrie as you can enjoy some tipples, then feel the hunger before moving on for dinner having relaxed the day away over some good quality drinks. I have never experienced anything but a friendly welcome and a good laugh with the bar staff and recommend the Guthrie for those who live or work nearby!"

Guthrie's has it all. Sit at the bar and chat with the bartenders and the regulars; enjoy the breeze by the window booth or privacy in the back booth. Are you a fan of music? The selection ranges from dance-pop to nostalgic rock to dusty hip-hop. Depending on the mood and patrons, I've heard everything from emo to ambient. Obviously, I have to comment on the drinks: As some other reviews have mentioned--yes, sometimes Guthrie's might be missing an ingredient for your favorite cocktail. Now, you can ask the bartender for something else, or write a pissy review about not being able to get precisely what you wanted. In my experience, going with the former has always led to a super-fun night and delicious drinks. But as for the most important thing: It's the bartenders. Each one is amazing and brings their unique energy to the bar. Whether it's the architecture, the music, the drinks, or the bartenders, what I personally love about the Guthrie is all the various permutations of experiences I've had there--ranging from a run-of-the-mill night out, to learning about something entirely new, to meeting some of the most wonderful people in New York City."

The bartenders were friendly and made good drinks. Now, this place has gone downhill due to new hires. The head female bartender (I believe someone called her Paige) stands behind the bar and, on numerous occasions, has made snide comments about requests, preferences and barely knew how to make an Old Fashion. As a bartender myself, I get how guests can be frustrating, but that is no way a bartender should act. I've never rolled my eyes at a customer or made comments to customers about other ones in front of their faces to be rude. That is exactly how you lose regulars. All in all, great cocktail menu and atmosphere, just change the attitude."

Was tempted to leave but since I came with a group of friends, I decided to stay. We sat in the back where it was dim and we barely saw each other (because it was just that dark in there). The buy one get one is tempting but the bartender who was working was unwelcoming and inattentive. Who wants to wait 10 minutes before getting a drink? Not me. After paying for the drink (and tipping..) she proceeded to tell me that I didn't pay and that the drink I ordered was my free drink... um what?? When I brought it to her attention she gave me an attitude threw the dinosaur chip for the free drink at me. What a joke. Bad vibes & bad service = unhappy customer. Will not be returning."

This place was on it so naturally we had to make a stop. What a dive bar indeed! It's super dark; they have B-Movies projected on the wall at the far end of the bar, it's dirty, and the bathroom is covered from floor to ceiling in graffiti. There are bookcases on the wall housing a few decorative books, giving the bar's name some relevance. There are a couple of tables and booths in the back in the pitch black where you can catch some of the movie and chat amongst friends over candlelight.They had a decent selection of beers, and their 2 for 1 happy hour is M-F but starts at 5pm. We were there a little too early to take advantage of this (no judgment zone here). Visiting was an experience to say the least, and that is one more bar that has been checked off the list."

Happy Hour. You get a BOGO with cute figurines. The bartenders are not the best. They're not even really nice, they spend a lot of time ignoring you and talking to the regulars. But once you're nice to them the first couple of drinks, you get better service.Grab a booth in the back, watch the projected film, put some punk on the jukebox. Maybe see what books are on the shelves. It gets packed on Friday and Saturday. So avoid unless it's around 12-1am. Don't come here for cocktails.

2159,a8Igk40PPHz1aqESKn2g6Q,4/16/2018,4 star rating,"Fun little divey place in the East Village, very much keeping the 70s/80s punk/rock vibe alive, one of the best periods in NYC culture. Thankfully it's not 1978 when this city was in the $hitter in every other respect.  But the late 70s were a terrific time for the NYC music scene. So it's great to hear Blondie, The Ramones and such and no modern pop. You will have to get used to large crowds in all NYC places on the weekends after 1000pm or so.  That is why I love partying it up during the week! :D"
2160,a8Igk40PPHz1aqESKn2g6Q,5/9/2015,4 star rating,"This is a definite locals bar. The people who hang out here have been hanging out for a very long time. They know each other well. They know what the other likes to drinks. What's new in their lives. But most importantly, if they want whiskey in their coffee? And where is the latest He-Man VHS to start the morning off on a Saturday. Nothing says morning like whiskey and 80's cartoons. One of the regulars travels an hour and half every Saturday just to spend his day here. Lucky for us we live a block away and we can roll in and out as we please. The happy hour is a total steal. You can buy one and get one free. They give you little toys for your second beer. If you drink $3 beers then you are really getting more bang for your buck. In the wee evenings on weekend warrior time, there is an extreme mixed crowd from, a 44 year old divorcée, bike riding hipsters, regulars and people who are completely obliterated. I am a little too old for all that and I prefer day drinking myself. This place is also great for groups. But good luck finding a spot at the bar."

I placed a mobile order while inside the restaurant and my number was called in less than 2 minutes.

They have plenty of room to sit with a whole second floor dedicated to extra seats, theres even a nice size play place for the kids ustairs. McDonald's shouldnt be your ""go to"" spot for food daily but every once in a while it sure does taste good and this is one of the better locations for a quick fix."

The tables are rarely clean. The place is full of homeless / junkies. The toilets are disgusting as well, and no soap in the soap dispenser.

They wouldn't acknowledge me by the wait station (not one, not two, but five staff members, one was including the manager) Being shoed away by an 18 year old kid with a cap (one of the workers) instead of answering me for not having my drinks, and not getting a response from the manager, i got disgruntled and left without even having a chance to look at the rest of the order. Not only did they not have a good handle of the staff, there's no rhyme or reason how the customers are even able to stand and wait for their food. Just awful...absolutely...awful. Only got one star because I wasn't allowed to leave it blank. 40 bucks down the drain."

While waiting, he was bragging about how he didn't know which day garbage is supposed to be thrown out or deliveries accepted. Shame on me for not checking, but the order was INCORRECT once again. After a long day, finally found parking, etc the same dopey manager told me to come back to get the items. Are u serious ?? They can't even credit the items forgotten over the phone. I'm now subjected to having to go back to that rat hole today. The place is filthy, main entrance loaded with grimy finger prints and trash al over the floor. Do yourself a favor and DON'T GO HERE."

Sis swears by the coffee but they don't have decaf so I don't usually buy it. Still, I can't fault a place that provided  a much needed bathroom after a tour of Dyker Heights Christmas lights that came after one LONG train ride. One bathroom was at ground level and two were at the top level, which an old lady waiting at ground level was kind enough to tell me about. And the bathroom I used was clean, though maybe because it was New Year's Eve and there was only a few sad looking patrons scattered throughout. I dashed in, dashed out, but noticed the place overall seemed clean, with masculine, brown striped wallpaper that reminded me of an old Hojo's. The tired looking worker seemed friendly as she conversed with a customer."

This is always sold out so order ahead!! The ube custard cake is so addicting! Perfect layer of eggy flanny custard on top of ube cake. A dream come true.

First impression was good, they were strictly observing social distancing and allowed only 2 customers at a time.I called earlier during the day to place my order of Ube Cheese Pandesal (the reason why we went to Queens in the first place) and when we were picking it up, we loved that they were just packing it in a box because they gave us the freshly baked ones! The staff was really amazing. Such warm friendly Cebuanos and mga Bisaya. Jerome who assisted my order was also so nice. Thanks again guys!And since we were already there, we thought of getting other stuff worth trying. We got the Pork Asado bun and also the famous Ube Custard cake (or Ube with Leche Flan). Happy they cut us 2 slices from a whole cake, really appreciated it! When we got home and for the next few days, here's our verdict: The Ube Cheese was delicious. Probably in my Top 3 in NYC. Not as much Ube Halaya inside as others but so delicious nonetheless! The Pork Asado bun was sooo good! Took me back to my younger days in Manila when I would enjoy a delicious Asado Siopao! My husband loved this too! And for the finale, the Ube Custard Cake was amazing! If you can only get one thing from this place (which trust me would be impossible!), you can never go wrong with this cake!Cannot wait to be back! Thanks Jerome and Team!"

Soft bread with cheese inside. Match so well together Pork asado bun. Inside has small chunks of pork and egg. It tastes ok for me.Cheese ensaymada. It's like a bun with cheese inside. Pretty good.

Don't forget to get a video/photo of that cheese pull!I can't wait to try their pork asado. I've tried ordering it a few times but it was sold out everytime. Pro tip: Call and put in your order and let them know what time you will be coming and they will have it ready for you :)
2178,bA0EeWGIdtDycEyZFKeGow,10/26/2021,4 star rating,"Kape't Torta is a Filipino bakery that serves a variety of Filipino baked goods that range from pandesals (bread roll), tortas (muffin), and cakes. They also have a selection of drinks, snacks, and even savory breads, so there are a lot of options to choose from whether you're looking for a snack or some dessert.I wasn't too hungry, so I opted for two pandesals: cheese drizzle and ube cheese. Overall, the pandesals were quite enjoyable, but I do wish I had them when they were more fresh, as the bread was not as soft and fluffy as I hoped it would be. I did arrive in the afternoon though, so the morning might have been a better time. Both pandesals are filled on the inside with cheese, which was nice and savory, but it was more solid when I was expecting a melty and gooey cheese filling. The cheese did contrast well with the sweeter pandesal bread though. The ube itself was nice as it had this slightly nutty and vanilla-like flavor. On the other hand, the cheese drizzle pandesal had some nice cheese topping on top. The best part though is that each pandesal is only $1, which is an unbelievable price these days for any food. It's definitely worth trying if you're looking for a quick, affordable snack on the go and if you got family, you might as well bring a box back home!Next time, I do hope to try some of their cakes and drinks, as they look really good. The ube cake with flan looks really decadent in particular and I have heard that the halo halo is good as well! If you love Filipino baked goods or would like to try some, Kape't Torta is a great spot to do so, as everything is available at affordable prices, so you can try a lot of things at once if you want to."

Staff recommended the ever popular Halo-halo, but I wasn't in the mood for the drink. I checked out a some Yelpers reviews and decided on the Ube with Pandesal and the Ube Ensaymada. The Ube Pandesal is a round bun with a cheesy filling, while the Ube Ensaymada is a Ube muffin with a sweet cheese topping. Both items were very filling and I enjoyed it. The pastries tasted especially good when it's still warm with the gooey cheesy center. Will go back soon to try out their other types of Ube favorites."

2181,bA0EeWGIdtDycEyZFKeGow,3/16/2021,5 star rating,"Passed by this place many times but it's in such an awkward area that I always pass it. Not this time! It's a small bakery with lots of yummy things on display. They have cakes, sweet and savory bread, drinks and etc. I got the Ube Cheese Pandesal, Mango Cake, Pork Asado Bun and Suman. I was slightly disappointed that they didn't have just plain Ube Pandesal but I learned that I have to pre-order that. Next time!Suggest you warmed up the buns and they taste even better! I loved the Ube paste inside the Pandesal, the bread was soft and fluffly, and not too sweet. I could do without the cheese but it's because i'm lactose intolerant. Pork Asado bun tasted like a char siu pork bun but without all the sauce. Flavorful and tender with the egg inside, was such a tasty surpise. The bread was also soft and fluffly. I would totally get it again. Suman, now that was okay, I do wish it had more coconut flavor but I think I should ate it with like mango or something else. Mango cake, omg please do yourself a favor and go get it! The entire cake! I thought red ribbon was good but kape't torta's is ten times better. It was soft and light, with a great mango flavor infused in the cake. The whipped cream, now i'm not a fan of whipped cream but theirs was delicious, probably because it has mango in it.  I have got to go back and eat more, like their Ube custard cake or Ube leche flan."

The food here was just that good. I don't give out 5 stars easily, but the food makes it well deserved.

Delivery has been consistently on time and quick, and they have plenty of seating if you're eating there. Prices are also pretty reasonable. They have both American Chinese and authentic Sichuan dishes (their menu labels, not mine), and while the American Chinese stuff is fine, I've generally preferred the Sichuan dishes. The menu is large, but while we often try new dishes, we usually end up ordering at least a couple of our favorites every time. The ones we've gotten the most are probably the shredded chicken with sour cabbage, the dry sauteed string beans with minced pork, and the dan dan noodles. Their lunch specials are also a good deal, and I like getting some of my favorites with a side of fried rice included."

Bay Ridge is no Chinatown, but this restaurant brings Chinatown to Bay Ridge. The Chengdu Spicy fish hot pot is phenomenal, at just $27, you get a huge pot of fish stew. The spice is perfect, the numbing peppers don't overwhelm, and its loaded with fish, cabbage, tofu, peanuts and onion. I also recommend the chicken with sour cabbage. And don't leave without trying their wonton appetizers."
2188,zjks9r34-5cw9FrONfpsCg,2/10/2018,4 star rating,"This Sichuan spot is perfect for those interested in authentic spicy Chinese food. At a place like this you need to order their Sichuan dishes as opposed to the American style Chinese dishes. The Sichuan Dan Dan noodles were filling and had the perfect ingredients. The spicy oil works well with the noodles, so mix your dish well to ensure every single noodle touches that oil. The Sichuan shrimp wontons cooked in red oil came as 6 wontons. The sauce was again delicious and I liked that there were whole shrimps in each dumpling. In my opinion, their worst dish out of the ones we had was the Ma po tofu, which was ironically one of their most ordered dishes. I found it to be very light on the meat content, which is a necessity in Ma po tofu. There were moments when I even questioned if there was any ground beef in there at all. Overall, this is a good spot in Bay Ridge to get many plates to share with a group of friends."

The food was great then and tonight September 2nd 2017 why only 2 stars ??? THE SERVICE!!!! This is the second time I was disappointed and this time was real BAD.Let me start with the positives which was the food. Ordered an appetizer the Sichuan Shrimp wontons with hot oil. For the main course ordered the Crispy Shrimp with salted and pepper. The sautéed pea shoots with garlic, and Chicken Mei Fun. The food is consistently great I won't take that away from them.The problem is when you go to eat in a restaurant you expect 3 things to come together usually. Food, Service and Decor. I debated doing take out because I know the decor is very bland, basically no decor. The service was just ok, even though it was raining I opted to eat in the restaurant.HUGE MISTAKE!!! PLEASE LOOK AT THE PHOTO OF THE WAITRESS. There is a tv and it was tuned to a Chinese music show that I could not understand. The waitress who was dressed like she was working as a dishwasher or hanging out and was GLUED to the tv almost the whole time I was there.  The other waiter brought out the dishes she only came back to give me the check. The appetizer came out last and each dish came out about 2 or 3 minutes apart. Nobody refilled my water and the most insulting part is that she brought the check without asking if I wanted anything else. Never a ""how is everything? Do you need anything else etc."" Worst part is that there were 2 waiters and only 3 tables and that's how service was.I can count on one hand how many times I either stiffed a waiter or gave an extremely low tip in my life. I usually tip 20-25% or better.  In this case it was 10% and that was a gift. I hope the owners read this because they have both Yelp and Trip Advisor stickers on the front window.If I go out and spend more than $50 of my hard earned money on a Saturday night I should feel good. I could have gone anywhere, I took the time to come out in heavy rain and I felt not welcome, ignored, and unwanted. Why waste your time in people that don't care about their customers? That the impression I got. Noooooo i would not go back there no matter how good the food is. You only have one chance to make a GREAT IMPRESSION. I would not recommend going here unless you really don't care about service at all. If you're on Yelp you probably do."

Dan Dan noodles were bland, wontons had a meat that tasted so gross, ordered chicken fried rice that was bland as well and tofu that was actually pretty good. Once we tasted how bad the food was we told the staff and they began to yell at us. We told them to take it back and we would pay for what we ate and they were persistent that it was our fault. The crazy thing is we heard another table complaining how the meat tasted bad in whatever they ordered. Avoid this place for sure."

No. Greek ex? Yes.My favourite Gyro in NYC (not including the real pork Gyro at BZ Grill in Queens) is at Gyro World not too far from here, also in Bronx. However their inconsistency led me to seek out other Gyros in the town, and my word, I found a very good one named ""Greek Express.""If you have a former lover in East Greece and another in Western Greece, then this place would be more suited to your ""Greek Ex - West.""As you can see from my picture, it's a cheap, saucy, hefty, delicious Gyro with perfect Gyro meat, with fresh crisp lettuce, juicy tomatoes and sauce, and of course soft fluffy yummy pita bread. All of the elements of this Gyro are perfect, so while it's not as good as Gyro World when Gyro World is ""on"", it's consistently fantastic and I never come to the Bronx without getting a Gyro from here. The service is nice, the prices are low (I think it's under $6 for a Gyro), it's a generous portion, in other words you won't get a much better Gyro than this anywhere in the country.If your former flame from Athens is bothering you, that's ""Greek Ex Stress"" and if the girl you used to date from Thessaloniki left some of her clothing with you, that's your ""Greek Ex's Dress."" I have a few ""Greek Exs"" myself, and no, I didn't focus on Greek style sex with them, thank you very much. Not that I'm opposed to it. But you know. It's just not the focus. Anyway.

2217,zjks9r34-5cw9FrONfpsCg,7/7/2015,1 star rating,Now I know we are in the Bronx.  But that is still no excuse for the lack of customer service.  First off I just ordered through the drive thru.  I just had my food thrown at me at the pick up window.  The girl had no personality. Never said hello.  Didn't even look at me.  Hand me my drink and walked away. Then to top it off no BBQ sauce as I asked for and the fires where stale.  Figures.  Never again! And I thought the remodel would have changed some things. I guess the wrong thing got revamped.  Need to train your employees better or get new ones.
2218,zjks9r34-5cw9FrONfpsCg,1/23/2019,1 star rating,Worst McDonald's ever!!! Very lazy staff. Wasn't taking orders at terminal and seen the line getting long but waited for each guest to come up to tell them to order at Kiosk. Which made the people who already had tickets wait even longer. Black specks from fountain soda was all over ice and visibly seen after drinking the soda completely. When I touched the substance I knew it was from the nozzle or they just aren't cleaning their fountain machine. The girl mopping was telling everyone to move out the way. Never have I seen anyone at any McDonald's anywhere tell a guest to move so they could mop. I'm sorry I won't be coming back here stick to the drive thru the inside is not going to leave you happy.

The floor was so sticky my sneakers were making noise as I walked. It's not as if it was packed with people and they were super busy because it wasn't. And this is stickiness that's been there since the morning because it wasn't just one section it was the whole damn restaurant because as people walked around all of their shoes made noise. Now on to the staff. The young lady who I am assuming is the manager because of her shirt was behind the counter yelling at her male coworker ""fuck you"" numerous times. Any other time I wouldn't pay it any mind but there were children there waiting for their order with their mom who quickly shuffled them to have a seat. Needless to say I won't be returning, I never should've been eating that crap in the first place so that's what I get."

I've tried the fish, calamari, and chorizo tacos, and they're all equally delicious! I love the crispiness of the calamari, and the chorizo is super flavorful that I don't even mind the sauciness of it making my taco a mess. I love that they top the tacos with sliced radish because it adds the perfect fresh crunch. The margaritas are delicious (especially passionfruit) and strong. Most importantly, their HOT SAUCE is amazing. It has a great kick and I love it on the tacos."

They are always there for me when I need them, consistent in their impeccable service, affordable, delicious and hits the spot every, single time. It's also a very special thing to find a burger that is expertly built, that stays together when you eat it and that is evenly crafted to the last bite. And the chips are lightly salted and always great to heat up in the oven if you're too full to finish them.¡Te quiero, La Lupe! ¡Pa siempre!"

Chose to dine in yesterday and bring my family for some margs and was baffled by the fact that the server/bartender was arguing with a guest regarding him not tipping (I understand the frustration.. I'm a server) but for him to say all those things in front of guests was a horrible experience. I tried to let it go and ordered some guacamole and margaritas, but the argument became worst when the owner came and he was arguing with her about his wage.. we just paid and left :/. Guacamole tasted fresh, and margs were okay... but i would chose good service and experience over okay food any day."

I had shrimp tacos, la pastor taco, the corn, and a mango margarita, everything was tasty very good. The la pastor isn't spicy as stated but is pretty good just a little dry in spots where there is just meat in the taco. The shrimp taco was phenomenal I recommend if you visit here you try it. The mango margarita which was $10 doe a mason jar was great the salt got me though (referring to the rim of the glass). Overall It's truly a five out of five stars restaurant."

It's massive so it can get filling, we had to hold back from getting too full. The spicy pork bone, potato & vegetables casserole was so good. It's a little spicy but it's cooked over the stove while being served so it stays warm. They also restock the soup base for you so it's alot of food. Comes with a side of rice. Very homey feel and food is so comforting. Def try!"

Our food came our super hot and the aroma was incredible, I almost think that they know what we wanted and times it perfectly. We orders C3 and C12, feel free to look it up. So many choices. We felt like we where eating moms home cooking.  Damn we were stuffed.  Maybe the stars aligned, but definitely going back and hope my next visit is the same with an additional star."
2290,_9nTH50K42Yme41Ue1SKRQ,2/1/2022,4 star rating,"The fact that The Kunjip has an average rating of 2.5 stars with 1000+ reviews is simply outrageous. Take it from me: The Kunjip is a solid 3.5 to 4 star restaurant.I tried the Gobdol Bibimbob ($20) and the Jap Che ($19). The bibimbob was a bit bland, but still okay. The rice at the bottom got a bit hard, but that was just a result of the stone pot being very hot. The Jap Che was decent - very standard in quality. We also got the Pomegranate Soju Cocktail ($12) which tasted more like juice than a cocktail, but was tasty nonetheless. They also gave us a bunch of small complementary appetizers to start, as is the custom in Korean restaurants, and these appetizers were really tasty, especially the fish cakes and the apple slices. They even gave us additional appetizers once they saw we had finished the small plates, which was very generous of them.Many of the complaints on Yelp about The Kunjip are about the service, but I actually thought the service was quite good. In addition to giving us extra appetizers, the staff were friendly and the service speed was pretty quick. Our waitress even went out of her way to instruct me to use the hot sauce on the bibimbob, which showed that she cared about my enjoyment of the meal. The interior of the restaurant has ample seating and is designed in a classic Korean restaurant style.Overall, do not trust the many negative reviews of this place, as they are not an accurate reflection of The Kunjip. I am not saying that this place is 5 star quality, but it is certainly a respectable spot for a wide array of decent traditional Korean food."
2291,_9nTH50K42Yme41Ue1SKRQ,10/13/2022,5 star rating,Really not sure why the reviews for this place is so low but the taste and value here is great. Their lunch special is unbeatable and really filled me up. I could forgo service if the food is yummy and I really didn't think the service was bad

Service is great.  The Korean lady kept coming to us to make sure the noodle is cut, side dishes are filled, etc.  she did not speak very fluent English but she provided excellent service."

2294,_9nTH50K42Yme41Ue1SKRQ,8/17/2022,5 star rating,"This is a great Korean restaurant serving up all of your traditional Korean dishes. There's 2 floors and the second floor is primarily for parties looking to have table BBQ. We sat on the first floor since we were looking to get a couple of the soup dishes. We ordered the Kam Ja Tang (spicy pork bone and potato stew), which was really good and had plenty of meat in there which I liked, and the Budae Chigae (spicy kimchi, noodles, sausages, and tofu stew), which was also very good. They weren't skimpy on the banchan assortment (these are complementary side dishes that are random based on the day) which I also liked since some Korean restaurants in Manhattan can be real stingy - they came out with 7 different types and all were delicious, and after seeing that we were scarfing these down, the waitress kindly offered to bring more out for us. :)Overall, the service here was quick and very friendly and the food was delicious and reasonably priced. I'll definitely be coming back and I highly recommend giving this place a try if you're in the neighborhood."

It's a great spot to go after a concert, arcade, movie, etc. I've been here a couple of times and the portions have always been big, which I love. The food is always made with the best quality and I especially love the tteokbokki here. I usually don't like tteokbokki that's sweet but The Kunjip knows how to make it work. This is the only sweet tteokbokki I can eat all day. The servers are always so nice and welcoming which makes me come back often. I also love their selection of banchan as it is always so refreshing and hits the spot. I've had their udon before which is also very delicious and the kimchi fried rice is also amazing. They give a complimentary tea after your meal and it's just perfect."

My husband and I shared the bossam and nengmyun. Both dishes were solid and great for the summer heat. The bossam came with a great radish salad and kimchi and cabbage wraps. Nengmyun was just a classic regular, with tangy cold broth and chewy noodles :)The banchans were solid as well. This isn't a gimmicky restaurant - it's just your classic homey Korean spot that will do the job if you're craving!"

2299,_9nTH50K42Yme41Ue1SKRQ,10/10/2019,5 star rating,"I have no complaints! I ordered paw see ew with tofu to pick up myself through Postmates. I didn't get an option to specify spice level like some people in the reviews did, which was fine because there was no spiciness (that's how I like it). The initial pick-up time was a little under 30 minutes from when I ordered it and I ended up getting a text that it was ready in under 10 minutes, so I was a little afraid that the food would be cold after walking there and walking home. However, it was well-packaged and insulated, so it was still hot. I thought the restaurant itself was very cute and well-decorated, and from the peek I saw inside the kitchen it looked clean and organized. The woman who helped me at the front desk was really nice. The actual food was delicious, too! I'm not an expert on Thai cuisine but I've had kind of bland, boring pad see ew with sad tofu before, and this was the opposite. The tofu was the perfect texture. It had some fun vegetables I don't always see in these types of dishes, like carrots and asparagus. The vegetables were well-cooked - still crunchy but not hard. The sauce was very flavorful."

We both got drunken noodles with chicken, I thought mine was better bc I got spicy he got non spicy. There was a strong smell like some other reviews but I thought it tasted great. Only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 is bc my order was significantly smaller than my bf's despite being basically the same thing. Also got a Thai iced tea which we both thought was good.

They offered to contact UberEats so I can be provided with a refund, but I only received a follow up from UberEats stating they can't refund my order which is ridiculous. I contacted the restaurant again to inform them of UberEat's response and they claimed they would follow up with UberEats support but its been radio silence ever since. I will NEVER EVER again eat from this place. If I could give this place negative stars I would."

The food was so stone cold i had to put it in the microwave and eventually just threw it away along with menu. i should have known when the food was prepared and was waiting for me in much less than 10 minutes. Obviously they just put my food in the microwave themselves before I arrived for my pickup. I would have given it my dog but I love dogs and wouln't be this cruel to him. Their curry puffs should be called ""air puffs"" as there is nothing but air inside. Their food is overpriced and underportioned. Stay away from this place."

Nope. Just overpriced garbage. I ordered the drunken noodles and I walked home excited to try thai food close to my house for the first time. First bad sign was how piping hot it was. The type of hot that only comes when something has been microwaved. Next bad sign was the god awful smell. Reminiscent of really strong pee (which another reviewer of the drunken noodles from this place had mentioned).

I was disappointed by the summer rolls because it seemed like it had been sitting out for a bit before it was served to us as they were tough to chew. While the pork chop was very flavorful, it was thin and a bit on the dry side. My friend who enjoyed the beef dish said it was very flavorful and the spring rolls on top were a good addition too. The Vietnamese ice coffee on the other hand was 5/5, very refreshing."

The flavor of the broth was good as well, definitely cured my migraine! Definitely a great spot if you're wanting a hot soup noodle fix. $10.50 for a beef pho bowl is a price you can't beat!"

Came back to find many items were taken off the menu and they would not offer it upon request. The service here is also lacking, I remember the staff being more attentive. The food still tastes great. Best pho anywhere. Make sure you have the PHO! I hope it was just a bad day and I get better service when I come back."

It's a modern take on Vietnamese sandwiches packaged with love. I love Vietnamese cuisine! I ordered the Banh Mi Dax Biet and Banh Mi Thit Heo Nuong. They're both really good. I prefer the grilled pork one I had (Banh Mi Thit Heo Nuong) more but that's just my preference, I like most meats grilled. The one I had tasted smoky good. I love how they wrapped it in clean newspaper looking parchment paper. It was sooo perfect and cute. Love how they sliced the sandwiches in half. Perfect for taking to work or buying for your kids for school etc. perfect to go food. Pickled veggies are spot on too still kept some of the traditional Vietnamese ingredients and put a modern twist on the sandwiches."

Once I took the first sip, it was more comforting/nurturing/gentle and not one of those broths that are more aggressive with the taste. The noodles and toppings were super on point with the broth and everything tasted fresh. The iced Viet coffee was so strong. It is worth the price. I would probably go to a different Vietnamese place in the area during every visit just to switch the tastes around. They are all good in their own way."

(Both times, the plastic looked exactly the same) The first time, the man I spoke to on the phone apologized on their behalf and was sincere about it and told me to come get a free drink of my choice. Today, I found another piece of plastic in my drink and the man I was on the phone with was extremely rude! I explained to him the situation and he responded, ""Okay and? It's weird how it only happens to you, but not to any of our customers."" I told him that this piece of plastic could've been swallowed, which could've caused serious health issues. He then said ""I'm sorry"" and left me on pause for a while. I said ""Okay, I understand but what will you do about this?"" He then again stayed silent on the phone. So I said, ""The man last time gave us a free drink, is that your offer to us? Or should the health department be involved in this?"" He said ""I don't care because I am not the owner of this place, I'm just a worker."" So I proceeded to say, ""Right, you may not care, but working in the food industry, your customers are expressing their concerns, shouldn't you be considerate and empathetic enough to do something about it?"" It took him about 10 minutes within the phone call to finally give in and say ""I mean if you WANT, you can come here and get a new drink."" I have never dealt with such poor customer service from this store. I know this does not depict the whole store, but this worker clearly and surely does not care about his customers wellbeing. I went back to the store and spoke to the lady at the cashier about what went on over the phone, she was very polite and apologized multiple times, but the man who I spoke to on the phone, was there as well and was just very rude. He looked at me and gave me an attitude when I showed him the piece of plastic I had in a ziplock bag as proof. He hide behind their wall to observe the plastic, said something in another language, and the lady at the cashier offered a new drink, whereas he just ignored me and went to do something else."

I was told to order the drink and pay for it first with the Kung Fu Tea app, then it would be deducted so that it would be free of charge. After making my purchase I asked the cashier to verify if the price would be deducted. The cashier said it would charge my credit card and will not be deducted and the event was a buy one get one free. I then asked for a refund, but was told it was not refund refundable. I asked if I could be given another drink since I already played for one to make it buy one get one free. This time the cashier told me that I would have to make another purchase. I would have never bothered going out of my way to stand on a long line to order a drink if I knew I would have been SCAMMED.

And the girl said ""oh yes. "" then she took my order. I asked for a milk green tea and she said they ran out of green tea so I settled for a milk tea instead.  I asked for 25% sugar and she replied with an attitude ""30% only.""  Fine. My drink came out to be $3.50 (as expected since I go here often) and I gave her $4.00 - she gave me my receipt WITH NO CHANGE.  She went back to cleaning while a guy was making the drink for me and I'm really debating if I should ask for it back.  I'm in no way cheap about 50 cents but least give me back my money so I can put it in the tip jar instead.  I find this to be super rude!!!  I ended up not asking for it because the guy who made my drink made it real quick so I appreciated that.I know this is a bubble tea place on 8th Ave so reviews might not matter as much but just wanted to let everyone know about my story. Note to self: do not come 45 mins before closing and always have exact change.  I am very disappointed in you, KFT."

Like many of the bubble tea places, they offer the option to customize the sugar level. Their Bubble tea at regular sugar is on the sweeter side. I stopped by this locations a couple of times. It is small and there is usually a a lot of traffic in here. I found on yelp that they have a limited edition drink called bluebell vineyard so I decided to give t a try. I agree with Jenny T.  It looks cool but definitely not worth $7. It is like a regular large drink with crushed ice in a voss bottle. The blue is the tea, red is strawberry and the orange is mango. You definitely need to shake it and mix it before drinking it. This drink is very sweet and it taste like concentrated syrup after the ice melts. I had to add in water to dilute it. I wanted to try it so I spent the money for it but I would not get it again."

I am not a huge fan of sugary drinks, but when I do come here the only drink I usually get is a hot honey green tea, especially when I find myself having a sore throat. I sometimes get milk tea with herbal jelly with less sugar and it's not bad. Don't know if they are remodeling or redecorating the inside, but it's so plain. No decoration on the wall, just plain white walls.  Don't find anything special about this bubble tea joint. The staff are friendly, but there were times where I came here and they are always chit chatting among themselves and forget to notice the customers walking in and needing to place an order. Their drinks are definitely on the pricier side as well."

I order a classic with bacon, onions, pickles, lettuce and tomato. The fries are thin sliced and satisfying. I have ordered twice and I can say the burger size would be like holding a triple whopper with all of the condiments. I have to squeeze firmly because I'm always afraid the condiments will fly out.I usually call and order a double patty because I don't see it as part of the menu on seamless. That's a minus. Another minus is my belief they have a high order volume because it takes an hour for food to arrive and it usually is cold when I get it. This place is an excellent place to eat from but it takes too long to get your food. If I have to call to ask where my food is an hour later, you need more delivery personnel. I don't run a business so I don't know what the obstacles are, however, as a customer; receiving cold food is not a good indication and can be a business deterrer. I'll still keep ordering because the food is delicious, and hopefully my next review will see these things addressed."

Then for some reason they sent me burnt sweet potato fries that I didn't order. The waffles were soggy and cold . The chicken strips were cold cardboard and the sweet plantains were dripping with grease . And they completely forgot a bottled water I ordered.

I couldn't get passed it any further. 2) Ordered the Turkey chili but was instead sent an order of black beans w/ a bagel. 3) Lastly, the ""pasta primavera"" was subpar to say the least.Merchant just compensated for the black beans and refused to pick up the salad so they can see for themselves.

2368,jNPYmziqQjIMP-1pOgSZdw,4/2/2022,5 star rating,"Gorgeous restaurant above the Armani store of NY's famous 5th Ave. I had recently come here for a company event and did not realize that it was related to the store. The space itself isn't overly large and the seating can be quite intimate.Food is amazing from the bread to start to the dessert at the end. There was an array of bread that we had to dip into olive oil at the table. The crusty bread was my favorite, great chew and flavor along with that crispy exterior. - As an appetizer, I started off with a hamachi and tuna crudo dressed with a winter melon extract and pickled jalapeño. The overall flavor was pretty light and allowed the fish to shine. - The first course I took was spinach tagliolini. It was served with sweet langoustines and the sauce perfectly coated the pasta. I'd imagine the pasta to be freshly made in house as it does not have the Al dente chew that dried pasta provides. The shaved fresh black truffle puts the dish over the edge, adding that slight ooomph to the dish unlike that heavy truffle oil flavor that's prominently used in say, truffle Mac and cheese. - For the second course, I went with the beef. This was a 50 day dry age and I must say, it really does come through. Most steakhouse probably top off at around a 30 day aging period but this is my first time having something in the 50 day range. The exterior had an almost crispy crust contrasted by the tender beef from the aging process. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the aged beef flavor was phenomenal. I didn't particularly enjoy the radicchio as it was quite bitter but the overall dish was great. - As a close to the meal, I went with the tiramisu. It's not your typical big batch tiramisu but this is served with a coffee gelato on top to really dial in on the coffee flavor. The mousse was super light and paired with the gelato created the perfect bite."

These fashion houses deliver as well on food as they do on clothes.

Drinks to start we went with some wine white , not bad later on a few got some cocktails , martini , henny all good. They start u off with a few different breads , parmesan & bread sticks were good , the winner is the sour dough bread of course nice & hot dipped in the delicious olive oil this bread is crack , very good.  Appetizers for the table we went with the Burrata , wow this was delicious the burrata melts in your mouth great taste & the Pulpo I must say this was not bad, not typically a fan of it grilled but the way it is prepared with blueberries & mantecato was pretty good. Additionally they serve small tastings as appetizers there were 3 a mousse type not bad, zucchini chips good & a crab dip I believe? don't 100% recall the last but all were good. Main dishes I went with the Gnocchi very good , hubby had the Filet Mignon delicious. a few of our friends are vegans they do offer some choices u need to ask , they had a spaghetti pasta for the vegans , they liked it.   For dessert birthday girl had ice cream , by this time we were all full but gladly enjoyed the small dessert tastings. They served 4 a sweet type toast & dark chocolate squares not bad , the winners were macaroons & meringue pieces both very good & just the right amount of sweetness. only complain here was the wait time for the sour dough bread from the time they mentioned they would bring some to the time it actually arrived was at least 25-30 minutes. Service is very good they are very attentive , food was also very good , small portions for the prices which are on the high side but with all the small tastings u tend not to notice.

2406,FeiuQm8tXEmmhcm-ep8Tug,1/20/2020,2 star rating,"Not very tasty - just one of the many subpar Shanghainese restaurants that have sprouted up to take advantage of the newfound craze for XLB.We started with veg steamed dumplings - the filling was fine, but the texture was a little doughy, perhaps from being steamed too long. The dough also had a strange slightly sweet flavor that I didn't  love.The  pan fried noodles were a very small portion and almost flavorless. Felt like a thrown-together dish without care.Probably a place best avoided."
2407,FeiuQm8tXEmmhcm-ep8Tug,10/12/2020,2 star rating,I should've trusted the Yelp reviews:( Many restaurants down after Covid-19 but this one still opens. Thus I decided to give it a shot despite of the 3 stars reviews on Yelp. I thought it wouldn't be too bad but my bad. I ordered the spicy beef tendon noodles soup. The soup is plain and the spicy beef tendon is very spicy but flavorless. Their vegetables and coriander are not fresh. Think before you go try!!!
2408,FeiuQm8tXEmmhcm-ep8Tug,8/13/2019,3 star rating,"While Joe's Shanghai and Shanghai 21 are both quoting you 40 minutes of wait, Shanghai Heping always has seats available. If you find yourself in Chinatown craving soup dumplings on a busy Saturday, this is your spot to get quickly seated. The soup dumplings with pork and crab and the scallion pancake were both standard affair. Don't get me wrong, both dishes tasted well. However, neither dish knocked it out of the park. Our third dish, the crispy fried noodles with shrimp had an uneven amount of sauce and fried noodle ratio, leaving our not so crispy noodles swimming in the sauce after just a few bites. The shrimp was overcooked and just tasted foul. The final dish, braised duck with scallion in brown sauce took an hour to make. Thankfully we shared each dish, so the timing wasn't much of a problem. I've got to say, the duck was tasty. We were glad someone came to cut the duck for us. Otherwise we would have been totally useless with the bones. The meat was tender and smooth. I would have preferred a heartier vegetable with the duck over the scallion, maybe bok choy, but the scallion was tasty regardless. The brown sauce was a little too overpowering, but I guess that's why it is included in the name of the dish. When the check arrived, they asked us to tell them our tip amount to charge our credit card with it, which we found to be weird. We informed them we would tip after our card is swiped. Later, the person who returned our credit cards waited in front of us while we tipped, which continued to make us feel uncomfortable. There was no reason to be treated with such a lack of trust. I hope they try to give customers space while tipping in the future."

Their food was pretty decent especially spicy beef tendon and the portion with price was a good deal. However, the reason for only 3 stars was their service and cleanliness. The waiters there was really rude and sometimes it was not easy to understand what they said. Standard of cleanliness was bad as most of other restaurant in Chinatown."
2410,FeiuQm8tXEmmhcm-ep8Tug,4/1/2019,2 star rating,"Service is meh, food is meh.If it wasn't for the fact that my parties often choose this place, I would not go here to eat Shanghainese food. The waiters are hard to flag. Even when I'm literally waving my hands in the air, they are constantly busy. Funny, as they seem to be quick in giving us the bill when we aren't even done eating. The soup dumplings are not the best. It may be a personal preference that I dislike their thick skin, but their soup was also mediocre. The scallion pancake tasted great but came in small portions for the price. The main dishes are a hit or miss. I would not recommend this place out of all the other Shanghainese restaurants in Chinatown."

2412,FeiuQm8tXEmmhcm-ep8Tug,11/1/2019,1 star rating,"The food is decent, but the attitude of the staff here is absolutely appalling. I placed an order for pickup here a few days ago, and when I arrived I asked for an itemized receipt when paying. The lady at the counter said, ""I know you didn't order the first item on this receipt; don't worry I won't give it to you, but I don't want to redo the order so just pay this total amount."" I said, ""Absolutely not, I am not paying for a $7 appetizer that I'm not getting and did not order,"" and she was upset that I had the gall to refuse.She then redid the total and when I whipped out my credit card to pay, she was like, ""Do you not have cash?"" I said that I had asked on a different visit and confirmed that the amount would be the same whether I was paying by cash or by card. She said, ""Well it's not always the same; it depends on the day. If you're paying by card I'm going to have to charge tax.""I then checked the receipt and asked her about the ""tip"" row - I had not agreed to pay a tip! She then said that the ""tip"" was actually the tax, but didn't she say that there would only be tax if I was paying by card?! Also, I pointed out that the tax rate was incorrect. She then gave me back a dollar in cash and told me to shut up about it.When the food finally came out, she THREW THE WHOLE BAG OF FOOD ONTO THE FLOOR and had me pick it up from the floor, like a beggar. Like what the actual fuck?"

2414,FeiuQm8tXEmmhcm-ep8Tug,5/12/2018,4 star rating,"I've been coming here for a few years now with my family and I'd say this place is more of a solid 3.5 stars. To be quite honest, right next door is Shanghai Cafe, and they're definitely the better of the two. With Shanghai Cafe under renovations, Shanghai Heping is reaping the benefits. That said, we had dinner here tonight again and we have no complaints. I typically will tell you that the plain pork soup dumplings are better than the crab one, but in this case, the crab ones actually better. The seafood pot was quite good and so was the fried fish. The food is good, the service is average, but the price is very reasonable. And if you don't like waiting for a table, this is a great choice for your soup dumpling fix."
2415,FeiuQm8tXEmmhcm-ep8Tug,11/30/2019,1 star rating,"I don't expect 5 star service but the service & attitude here was appalling. The lady was rude when taking our order, I just asked for a glass of water and she brushed me off. When we ordered the soup dumplings she had this attitude like are you stupid and rolled her eyes when we asked a simple question. When we asked for the check they asked us to write our tip before swiping the card...weird. She stood over us while we wrote our tip which was very uncomfortable. Never coming back here, it wasn't just one lady all three ladies had really bad attitudes. I was just baffled in the end that I couldn't help but laugh never in my 20+ years of living in Chinatown have I encountered something like this."

I had a lot of question, I'm Allergy prone.The first time I walked in I wanted to inquire about prices. I reached half a block and I said ""I'll get these cupcakes"". I mainly came back because of the wonderful customer service from the young lady helping me with all of my concerns. The one last question I had really ticked off the BAKER. When the young lady came back to her a second time she said ""why"" after having a small tantrum for a few mins. That also included her shouting "" assholes"" I guess customers like me? Saying that repeatedly. Clearly Loud enough so I can hear. The baker came up to me with an aggressive demeanor and asked ""what questions do you have?"" I asked her my simple question and she gave me an answer with so much aggression. I don't know what I did to deserve that. I not for one second was rude or offensive. I thank the young lady for her time and customer service and I had to walk out because I was baffled by this company's baker behavior.

The GOT decorations were attention-getting, but the cupcakes themselves were super super great. The cake was moist and flavorful and the buttercream was not overly sweet. The Hennessy buttercream was a hit obviously (additional cost but totally worth it), and red velvet was so so good. It was a huge hit for the party and everyone asked where to go get them!"

I understand that this place gets a lot of celebrity clientele because that's how i heard of them but the treatment seems like they are only interested in celeb clients and can take or leave normal people's business.

So based on the map, I intended to go to Super Taco Plus (thanks to the WiFi, I saw that they had good Yelp reviews). But when I got there it was way too crowded. I saw Yummy Taco across the street with the ""hey, I'm a new business"" flags along the outside. I'm guessing this is a change, since there are so many with the same name. Anyway, not so crowded. Black bean burrito & a soda - $6.19. Not bad, but not great. Service was fast, they seemed to have it together. Though I wish there were more places to sit. But it's mostly a take out place - what can you do?My burrito was rather disappointing. It was poorly wrapped (don't even bother trying to pick it up) and when I tried to cut it, the tortilla was rubbery. Taste was pretty decent, albeit a bit salty. The one thing that made me happy was the salsa. With most Asian-owned Mexican take-out places they get the salsa completely wrong. All the right ingredients are there, but it tends to be watery. They miss the essence of what makes it different from just a sauce. But this time it was pretty thick, flavor was pretty good. Not authentic good, but much better than I was expecting. So all in all...meh."

Considering the fact that the place was practically empty it should've came out much quicker but oh well.The food taste fresh and was inexpensive (expected it to be a little more due to it's location). Of course it's not the best Mexican restaurant but it'll due for now. Overall: If I'm ever in the area and craving some authentic Mexican food I wouldn't come here.

We came here to eat before a concert, and noticed that they had some well-priced drinks, so of course we ordered a pitcher of margarita. As someone who isn't fond of the taste of alcohol, I loved that the margarita didn't have a strong alcoholic taste but still did the job, if you know what I mean ;)"

The crispy Mango Fish is a tad pricey and is listed among their ""authentic dishes."" I ended up liking it, and it is really filling as well. The fish is served with rice in the side. Rozena's pad Kee mao was a little disappointing. They might have gone a little overboard with ginger on that one. The best part were the flat noodles but we do wish we'd had the pad see ew rather. Might be a better spot for lunch than for dinner, especially considering its proximity to NYU."

Other good to knows-no reservations- $3 sapporos!! - good outdoor seating

So as you can tell, if there's any time to go to Klong, it's if you're feeling up for some happy hour drinks.But the food is a great addition too -- I usually get their Klong Chicken Wings (wings + beer, what a combo) and the sauce on these is so flavorful. Also as a big Tom Kha soup fan, I tried theirs recently and enjoyed it! Good portion of mushrooms and chicken.See you next time for happy hour :)"
2441,HsFv6pTnpIGya6Yf5ztn_g,3/1/2022,5 star rating,"A must try place in New York if you love Thai food! This place is exciting in that they have a separate menu for ""Authentic Thai"" dishes that are different than the common green curry and pad Thai noodles you see. We got the fried taro sticks, crispy mango fish, and ka-pi (shrimp paste) fried rice. None of these I have tried at a Thai restaurant before so I was super excited! Everything turned out amazing. Crispy mango fish comes with a bowl of rice - if you like a blend of freshness in your main entree this dish is perfect because you get a slight chili spice with the warm fried fish filet but also a slight tangy taste of fresh mango. It is a bit spicy but you can ask the waiter in advance to make it as not spicy as possible. Ka-Pi (shrimp paste) fried rice is nothing like your regular fried rice. It is presented in a way similar to bibimbap where they top the rice with all the delicious ingredients - mango, candied pork belly, dried shrimps, sausages, and more! You can then mix all the ingredients together to make this magical mouth watering fried rice dish. Again, the freshness of the mango adds an unforgettable taste. This place is amazing. Highly recommend to venture out and order from the ""Authentic Thai"" menu!"

This, for us, was a nice surprise that made our travel feel a little safer, but the point is that it should not have been a surprise upon arrival. There was also a lack of information at check-in: I had to specifically ask for a parking voucher (because I knew in advance about that amenity) and had to call back later for the Wi-Fi password (which was pretty slow).

There is no door, so your water will leak everywhere when you shower. To go to the pool, you have to reserve a ""pool time"" which is a little bit silly in my opinion. If you don't, you might not get a spot. The rooftop pool area is nice, but the bar is way overpriced. I ordered 3 drinks and Guac/Chips and our bill came out to be $90. Like what?!If you go during the weekend, be warned that you need to bring earplugs. People party till 5am and you will hear every single sound. It's not pleasant if you're looking for a peaceful stay, or some sleep.The hotel also needs someone opening that heavy main door, and I think a lot of the glass could be cleaned. Not sure if it's the grungy vibe they're going for but the elevator feels dirty because of all the hand prints you see on the walls. I personally didn't like that.Again, pros and cons. I enjoyed my stay but some things could be better."

The hotel itself is beautiful. I am happy to know that I can go back there when in Williamsburg when I am looking for a lovely place to drink and get out of the heat. I am also recommending it to my out of town friends as a perfect place to stay!"

The fire alarm keeps going off in your room if you take a shower... I called the front desk and shouted over the alarm that there's a problem and they said ""are you showering by chance? Oh yeah, that happens. I'll shut off the alarm for you"". They already know this is a common thing that happens when you shower! Then the alarm went off AGAIN and we called saying why is this happening you said you shut it off, and they said ""take a colder shower""....... WHAT......The bathrooms don't have anywhere to hang your wet towels.. water from the shower gets EVERYWHERE we had to use 2 towels to soak up the water form a single shower. And guess what- no where to hang the soaking towels. The bathroom barn doors hardly close, there's a massive gap on the bottom leaning the doors even more useless so you're just openly using the toilet with your significant other as there are NO DOORS and you're a few feet from the bed and the toilet !THE NOISE LEVEL IS LIKE A LAS VEGAS HELL. The rooms have a noise machine in them because the sound is already horrible and they know it. Because they have parties on the roof you can hear everything through the noise machine, and there are massive parties happening right across the street and the noise travels straight to your room. The DESTINATION FEE..... they inform you of an extra fee as you check out and we asked why that was and they said the fee is for access to gym/pool/and bikes that we could've paid to rent.... Had no idea about this. The staff ranged from nice to completely rude. The ELEVATORS hardly worked the whole weekend we were there, it took 10 minutes of waiting in the lobby to get room to go up to our room and a woman on the elevator had a meltdown and was cursing at how bad the elevator system was because you're competing with party-goers wanting to rage on the rooftop when you're just trying to get to your room...You can hear everyone in your hallway perfectly clear. I was lying in bed and there was commotion outside, a worker had entered our neighbors hotel room and they freaked out and started yelling because the couple were SHOWERING and as stated, there are no doors.I'm sure I'm forgetting more horrid experiences honestly but ill end this rant"

Food & drinks:The tea was flavorful, hot and cozy AF. I had the classic lemon verbena and felt it was perfectly made. The flavor wasn't too strong and had just enough sweetness. The high tea comes with three layers, the top is two scones and then a dessert layer and savory sandwiches. The scones came with clotted cream and paired perfectly with the tea. For the sweets, I really enjoyed the macaron and the eclair. For the savory level, you can easily cut each item into two small single-bite or two bite servings. These sandwiches all tasted fresh with bright flavors - I loved all the herbs on the cucumber sandwich. Overall a lovely treat. Value: if you're able to split an order of the high tea with another person I think it's a great deal. It's $45 for the high tea and $7 for each tea pot. Ambiance:Lovely. They had some cute jazz music playing and the interiors are so chic, plus the holiday decor was gorgeous. Service:Awesome. Genty was great! He made some recommendations which were much appreciated since it was my first time dining here and suggested that we split one high tea and add any extras we wanted."
2472,fXOYnl3ik_8n_tAoOjiDIw,1/22/2022,2 star rating,"This was a fun place to stay for a weekend, but there are some things we wish we had known in advance, some things we should have been told at check-in, and some things I would like to share so that other visitors can be better informed and prepared.We were not aware in advance that this hotel has a vaccination requirement, even to enter the building. This, for us, was a nice surprise that made our travel feel a little safer, but the point is that it should not have been a surprise upon arrival. There was also a lack of information at check-in: I had to specifically ask for a parking voucher (because I knew in advance about that amenity) and had to call back later for the Wi-Fi password (which was pretty slow). I was not informed of the $400 security fee and was shocked to see a (pending) credit card charge DOUBLE the confirmation email's price. I think perhaps they may have been training new staff personnel, though, so hopefully that will get better.My sister could not check-in to her room early despite having called in advance to request it (if possible) due to our planned arrival before her hair appointment for her birthday, and yet my room WAS ready when we got there, so clearly it was possible...that was a bit disappointing and delayed our day a little bit, but we understand it was not guaranteed.Beware, there are no coffee machines in the rooms and the free coffee/tea service in the lobby ends at 9am! (Again, it would have been nice to hear about that at check-in.) We did ask the restaurant for hot water so we could make tea (that we brought from home), but that was a little awkward.As for the room itself, the mattress was a bit too firm for me, not every room has a desk as advertised, and the wall of windows causes poor insulation (the room got way too hot when the sun was beating down through them, and then got way too cold when the sun went down and the howling wind picked up). We really appreciated that the hotel provided a sound machine in each room - not just to drown out the noisy wind, but also the street noise (garbage trucks in the middle of the night?), and the partying neighbors/hallway passersby. The casting feature on the TV made it very easy to sign-in and play a movie or show from any of our own streaming services, which was convenient and helpful. The open-layout shower without a door or curtain made for a very cold (heat escapes too easily to the high ceiling and right out the open doorway) and messy (water splashes EVERYWHERE) shower without any privacy (it really just needed one more row of frosted glass for the average-height person).All of that said, we loved the live jazz music in the lobby/bar area, enjoyed the beautiful architecture and decoration, and the views are amazing, especially from the night club inside an old water tower on the top floor! We visited in winter, so couldn't enjoy the rooftop pool, but I'm sure that's great as well. (visited 1/8/22)"
2473,fXOYnl3ik_8n_tAoOjiDIw,6/2/2021,4 star rating,"First, the room (Work & Workout suite) was great and very thoughtfully designed, save for the glitchy Liteboxer machine (more on that later). The layout of the suite makes you feel not cramped (which is super appreciated, given it's NYC). Plus, the two terraces and two bathrooms are a really nice touch (one in the office and the other in the bedroom). The mattress and bedding are *extremely* comfortable; you will have the best sleep of your life! I was never that person who pays attention to bedding- sheets are sheets, a mattress is a mattress. But I get it now! This will definitely be my go-to hotel when I visit.Btw, if you're not used to NYC apartment buildings, you might be shocked by the scalding water in the bathroom. Be gradual! About the Liteboxer machine. It wasn't set up to use automatically (it said it wasn't connected to the internet). The hotel was pretty responsive and someone came by to set it up. But even once it was workable, it kept glitching out, freezing and showing error messages. It was enjoyable when it was working but the experience was inconsistent. Since it was one of the main features of the suite, it was a bit frustrating that the software was so poor (but maybe that's the point? It gets you so irritated that you want to punch something?!)My experience with the restaurant and bar was not particularly good. It was unclear what the operating hours were and there was a gap in service of which patrons were not aware. I witnessed another patron be confused having waited for an hour for the server. Once the bar was serving again and I did order a drink, I found it to be extremely stiff. The food at the restaurant was average. Their bacon is more like a slab than thin and crispy. Anyway, to me these were relatively minor annoyances given how great the room was, as I did not go there for the restaurant but for the accommodations."

We were told it was extremely packed with an hr wait just to get a drink at the bar. We were informed by the hostess that they are not taking reservations fir the evening, but we could come back at 9pm. We opted to sit in the lounge until then. Ultimately we stayed in the lounge fir the rest of the evening. Service was excellent. The moment we sat, someone came to attend to us. We ordered figs wrapped in bacon (tasty) and birria tacos. I have never had birria tacos prior to this but my friend has. She said it wasn't exactly the same, but was still extremely good. The drink I initially ordered wasn't the greatest and I sent back fir a lychee martini. It was far from a lychee martini. I didn't care for it. But I should've stuck with items on the menu I suppose. I will be back because overall, my ex was great."
