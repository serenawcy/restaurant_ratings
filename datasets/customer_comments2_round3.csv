There was a technical issue because I never received the emailCorrection he said was sent a few times. Unbelievable.Initially, on 8/17 a front desk female associate said the extra $600 charged on my card was for incidentals but my friend who is not a minority wasn't charged that amount. The associate said I should see a credit. I only received half of that amount back and was charged an extra $10. I already prepaid over $400 for two nights. They did manage to get all of my room charges and resort fees correct. Not sure how the overcharges were incorrect. This is unacceptable. Update- I contacted the travel agent at 12:15 (after this review went live) and confirmed payments were sent. I called the front desk and Emmanuel answered and sent the email confirming the mistake and credit. He was pleasant and efficient. I wish this never happened. My hotel stay was excellent. He didn't mention any credit or offer for my troubles and time figuring out this situation. I had to take time from work to figure this out. An extra $600 on your bill when you already paid over $400 is hard to miss. Hopefully they figure out there agreements with Mr & Mrs Smith.So unfortunate."

A lounge chair becuase they are ""reserved"" they are reserved for ppl to buy, not for hotel guest. they do not tell you this before while your booking. The service  is trash. Absolutely rude. It's mind blowing.."
2,a-hVnSTC12MY5L3t9yOSJw,8/31/2021,4 star rating,"I had a good stay but I think the hotel is way too pricey for what it actually offers.The Queen room I got was cozy, the exposed bathroom is beautiful but the actual functionality is terrible. There is no door, so your water will leak everywhere when you shower. To go to the pool, you have to reserve a ""pool time"" which is a little bit silly in my opinion. If you don't, you might not get a spot. The rooftop pool area is nice, but the bar is way overpriced. I ordered 3 drinks and Guac/Chips and our bill came out to be $90. Like what?!If you go during the weekend, be warned that you need to bring earplugs. People party till 5am and you will hear every single sound. It's not pleasant if you're looking for a peaceful stay, or some sleep.The hotel also needs someone opening that heavy main door, and I think a lot of the glass could be cleaned. Not sure if it's the grungy vibe they're going for but the elevator feels dirty because of all the hand prints you see on the walls. I personally didn't like that.Again, pros and cons. I enjoyed my stay but some things could be better."

The hotel itself is beautiful. I am happy to know that I can go back there when in Williamsburg when I am looking for a lovely place to drink and get out of the heat. I am also recommending it to my out of town friends as a perfect place to stay!"

The fire alarm keeps going off in your room if you take a shower... I called the front desk and shouted over the alarm that there's a problem and they said ""are you showering by chance? Oh yeah, that happens. I'll shut off the alarm for you"". They already know this is a common thing that happens when you shower! Then the alarm went off AGAIN and we called saying why is this happening you said you shut it off, and they said ""take a colder shower""....... WHAT......The bathrooms don't have anywhere to hang your wet towels.. water from the shower gets EVERYWHERE we had to use 2 towels to soak up the water form a single shower. And guess what- no where to hang the soaking towels. The bathroom barn doors hardly close, there's a massive gap on the bottom leaning the doors even more useless so you're just openly using the toilet with your significant other as there are NO DOORS and you're a few feet from the bed and the toilet !THE NOISE LEVEL IS LIKE A LAS VEGAS HELL. The rooms have a noise machine in them because the sound is already horrible and they know it. Because they have parties on the roof you can hear everything through the noise machine, and there are massive parties happening right across the street and the noise travels straight to your room. The DESTINATION FEE..... they inform you of an extra fee as you check out and we asked why that was and they said the fee is for access to gym/pool/and bikes that we could've paid to rent.... Had no idea about this. The staff ranged from nice to completely rude. The ELEVATORS hardly worked the whole weekend we were there, it took 10 minutes of waiting in the lobby to get room to go up to our room and a woman on the elevator had a meltdown and was cursing at how bad the elevator system was because you're competing with party-goers wanting to rage on the rooftop when you're just trying to get to your room...You can hear everyone in your hallway perfectly clear. I was lying in bed and there was commotion outside, a worker had entered our neighbors hotel room and they freaked out and started yelling because the couple were SHOWERING and as stated, there are no doors.I'm sure I'm forgetting more horrid experiences honestly but ill end this rant"
5,a-hVnSTC12MY5L3t9yOSJw,12/19/2021,5 star rating,"Holiday High Tea I visited on a Sunday afternoon for the holiday high tea in the restaurant. Food & drinks:The tea was flavorful, hot and cozy AF. I had the classic lemon verbena and felt it was perfectly made. The flavor wasn't too strong and had just enough sweetness. The high tea comes with three layers, the top is two scones and then a dessert layer and savory sandwiches. The scones came with clotted cream and paired perfectly with the tea. For the sweets, I really enjoyed the macaron and the eclair. For the savory level, you can easily cut each item into two small single-bite or two bite servings. These sandwiches all tasted fresh with bright flavors - I loved all the herbs on the cucumber sandwich. Overall a lovely treat. Value: if you're able to split an order of the high tea with another person I think it's a great deal. It's $45 for the high tea and $7 for each tea pot. Ambiance:Lovely. They had some cute jazz music playing and the interiors are so chic, plus the holiday decor was gorgeous. Service:Awesome. Genty was great! He made some recommendations which were much appreciated since it was my first time dining here and suggested that we split one high tea and add any extras we wanted."
6,a-hVnSTC12MY5L3t9yOSJw,1/22/2022,2 star rating,"This was a fun place to stay for a weekend, but there are some things we wish we had known in advance, some things we should have been told at check-in, and some things I would like to share so that other visitors can be better informed and prepared.We were not aware in advance that this hotel has a vaccination requirement, even to enter the building. This, for us, was a nice surprise that made our travel feel a little safer, but the point is that it should not have been a surprise upon arrival. There was also a lack of information at check-in: I had to specifically ask for a parking voucher (because I knew in advance about that amenity) and had to call back later for the Wi-Fi password (which was pretty slow). I was not informed of the $400 security fee and was shocked to see a (pending) credit card charge DOUBLE the confirmation email's price. I think perhaps they may have been training new staff personnel, though, so hopefully that will get better.My sister could not check-in to her room early despite having called in advance to request it (if possible) due to our planned arrival before her hair appointment for her birthday, and yet my room WAS ready when we got there, so clearly it was possible...that was a bit disappointing and delayed our day a little bit, but we understand it was not guaranteed.Beware, there are no coffee machines in the rooms and the free coffee/tea service in the lobby ends at 9am! (Again, it would have been nice to hear about that at check-in.) We did ask the restaurant for hot water so we could make tea (that we brought from home), but that was a little awkward.As for the room itself, the mattress was a bit too firm for me, not every room has a desk as advertised, and the wall of windows causes poor insulation (the room got way too hot when the sun was beating down through them, and then got way too cold when the sun went down and the howling wind picked up). We really appreciated that the hotel provided a sound machine in each room - not just to drown out the noisy wind, but also the street noise (garbage trucks in the middle of the night?), and the partying neighbors/hallway passersby. The casting feature on the TV made it very easy to sign-in and play a movie or show from any of our own streaming services, which was convenient and helpful. The open-layout shower without a door or curtain made for a very cold (heat escapes too easily to the high ceiling and right out the open doorway) and messy (water splashes EVERYWHERE) shower without any privacy (it really just needed one more row of frosted glass for the average-height person).All of that said, we loved the live jazz music in the lobby/bar area, enjoyed the beautiful architecture and decoration, and the views are amazing, especially from the night club inside an old water tower on the top floor! We visited in winter, so couldn't enjoy the rooftop pool, but I'm sure that's great as well. (visited 1/8/22)"
7,a-hVnSTC12MY5L3t9yOSJw,6/2/2021,4 star rating,"First, the room (Work & Workout suite) was great and very thoughtfully designed, save for the glitchy Liteboxer machine (more on that later). The layout of the suite makes you feel not cramped (which is super appreciated, given it's NYC). Plus, the two terraces and two bathrooms are a really nice touch (one in the office and the other in the bedroom). The mattress and bedding are *extremely* comfortable; you will have the best sleep of your life! I was never that person who pays attention to bedding- sheets are sheets, a mattress is a mattress. But I get it now! This will definitely be my go-to hotel when I visit.Btw, if you're not used to NYC apartment buildings, you might be shocked by the scalding water in the bathroom. Be gradual! About the Liteboxer machine. It wasn't set up to use automatically (it said it wasn't connected to the internet). The hotel was pretty responsive and someone came by to set it up. But even once it was workable, it kept glitching out, freezing and showing error messages. It was enjoyable when it was working but the experience was inconsistent. Since it was one of the main features of the suite, it was a bit frustrating that the software was so poor (but maybe that's the point? It gets you so irritated that you want to punch something?!)My experience with the restaurant and bar was not particularly good. It was unclear what the operating hours were and there was a gap in service of which patrons were not aware. I witnessed another patron be confused having waited for an hour for the server. Once the bar was serving again and I did order a drink, I found it to be extremely stiff. The food at the restaurant was average. Their bacon is more like a slab than thin and crispy. Anyway, to me these were relatively minor annoyances given how great the room was, as I did not go there for the restaurant but for the accommodations."
8,a-hVnSTC12MY5L3t9yOSJw,6/12/2021,4 star rating,"I had a lovely time here. My friend and I came here close to 8 looking to go to the rooftop. We were told it was extremely packed with an hr wait just to get a drink at the bar. We were informed by the hostess that they are not taking reservations fir the evening, but we could come back at 9pm. We opted to sit in the lounge until then. Ultimately we stayed in the lounge fir the rest of the evening. Service was excellent. The moment we sat, someone came to attend to us. We ordered figs wrapped in bacon (tasty) and birria tacos. I have never had birria tacos prior to this but my friend has. She said it wasn't exactly the same, but was still extremely good. The drink I initially ordered wasn't the greatest and I sent back fir a lychee martini. It was far from a lychee martini. I didn't care for it. But I should've stuck with items on the menu I suppose. I will be back because overall, my ex was great."

10,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,5/8/2021,4 star rating,"Really cute bar, not the fastest service! We stumbled upon this bar on a Saturday afternoon and got seated immediately. I ordered a Moscow Mule (which was very well made) and then we got some mac & cheese bites, buffalo cauliflower, and buffalo wings. Everything was pretty good for bar food, but the sauce that both the wings and cauliflower came with was a bit watered down. The service was a little on the slower side, and we thought a place called The Happiest Hour may have daily happy hour specials (nothing on weekends), but definitely a good bar option in the area!"

12,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,8/10/2021,4 star rating,"I'm so sad that I forgot to take a photo! I was here for pre-dinner drinks, so I can't comment on anything other than my experience during that timeframe. It was nicely situated on a less-busy street. There are outdoor high tops right along the street and outdoor cubical-esque table options farther into the sidewalk that share the wall with the restaurant.Our server was super sweet and attentive without being overly attentive. My group was indecisive about our drink order, and he nicely walked us through various options suited for our group of 4. We ended up getting a pitcher of mango mango with tequila, and there was a lot of ice haha. I wouldn't get this drink again but would definitely come back here for happy hour or casual drinks if I am near the West Village."
13,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,7/23/2022,1 star rating,"Absolutely hate this place. Â The ""Â securityÂ "" seems to think that their authority means they can touch women inappropriately. Â We had our backs turned and had the security guard wrap is whole hand around my friends bare shoulder as he walked by. Â No words, no request, we were just standing in a circle drinking. Â He did this all 3 times he walked by and only put hands on her.Glass broken multiple times while we were there (happens) but they just picked up the big pieces and left it. Small shards of glass everywhere, not a broom in sight. Â My girlfriend was wearing open toed shoes so not ideal.Also, if you care about this sort of thing, the staff does not wear masks and masks aren't required but it still claims both on their Yelp."

15,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,4/5/2021,3 star rating,"Stopped in for a weekend bite. Ill start with the burger. It's good. Juicy. Flavorful. It's a good burger. Is it $15 good? No. If it was around $10 it would be a better price point. Same for the cocktails. For $15, you shouldn't be serving well cocktails. The tequila is Cuervo gold! There are much better substitutes in the same price range. This would be a cool place to come as a group. The staff was friendly and the ambiance is pretty cool. Go check them out. ENJOY!!!"
16,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,1/16/2022,4 star rating,"This has become a go to spot for me. While the west village can be a little on the younger side, this spot tends to have a good range of people attending.The drinks are also great. I love the fact that you can select the type of alcohol you want in them. Helps to keep you consistent with what you're drinking and also add your own spin to the drink. Vibes are good and service is fine. Definitely recommend when you're in the area."
17,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,2/4/2021,5 star rating,"Heated pods, cocktails by the carafe and standout bar food. The Happiest Hour delivers on many levels. While the burger has gotten a lot of press, my favorite dish was actually the salt and pepper broccoli. The batter was so light and crispy and the broccoli was tender. I couldn't stop eating these, even sans sauce. The burger itself was quite delicious. Â It's like the best burger you could make by yourself at home without having to do the work. Ain't mad about that. Also, the old fashioneds were strong and served quickly. Again, ain't mad about that. Get your day drinking or casual meet up on at The Happiest Hour. Just be sure to have a reservation."
18,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,3/13/2021,4 star rating,"7.8/10Happiest burger: nice, simple burger, pretty light; very similar to shake shack burger; nice secret sauce; bun nice and soft; patty really soft as well; everything goes together very well; cheese is normal; probably would've liked if it was a bit heavier, felt like a $15 burger was gone in about 15 seconds, especially since I could've gotten an almost-identical (if not slightly inferior) shake shack burger a couple blocks away.."
19,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,3/13/2022,1 star rating,"I had high hopes for this place, but the way mine and my girlfriend's tab was handled was business malpractice. I arrived late to a party that my girlfriend was attending that had a table minimum. By the time I arrived, the minimum was hit and the tab closed. Because I didn't have a drink, a tab was opened by my girlfriend and 2 drinks were ordered.When we asked to close the tab, the waitress serving the table told us that ""a couple"" of extra drinks were ordered on the open tab, pointing at who ordered them.The amount of drinks ordered was not ""a couple"" but ended up being 8 drinks, pushing the bill up to $188. Naturally, the person in question did not want to pay back, and because we couldn't settle with the other party involved, had to pay the bill. This place needs to review its business practices, because putting that many drinks on someone's tab without confirming is malpractice. I will not be returning, and the cost of that visit is worthy of 1 star."

The delivery guy was friendly and actually brought my food upstairs which was nice! The strawberry milkshake was good, although a bit small for the price tag.The tuna melt, however, was horribly disappointing. The sandwich arrived cold, on stale bread, and the cheese was NOT melted. A tuna melt, by definition, is supposed to be served hot with melted cheese. I will give them credit for subbing the roll for the white bread like I asked. If you want a cold tuna sandwich, their tuna salad is a good mixture. That's not what I wanted though, as I find cold tuna salad unpalatable. Â Unfortunately I had no bread to replace the stale roll I was served in order to heat it up myself so it ended up in the trash."

The hummus was interesting tasting, a lot sweeter than I'm used to - so much so that I thought they'd given me salad dressing before I realized it was hummus. The green spicy sauce that it came with was really good. Despite the hummus being weird, the rest of the meal made up for it. 3.5 stars, rounding up."
65,qrncvjkiKN5Z-JC06ygy6A,12/8/2020,4 star rating,"Love their food! Little sad that they raised their lunch special price to $14. It used to be $11.50. Is anything over $12 even a lunch special then? The meal comes with salad, pita bread, an appetizer (hummus or eggplant) and an entrÃ©e that comes with rice and some grilled veggies. I'm not saying it wasn't a lot of food and that I didn't leave stuffed. I'm just saying I could have been stuffed for a lot less LOLTheir pita bread was warmed nicely and came with butter, white sauce, and this amazing green sauce that reminded me of the kind you get with empanadas. Their hummus is okay. Not much is done to it in terms of seasoning. Their eggplant is delicious. It's very soft (or mushy) which some people may not like. It could have used more salt or seasoning. I've had it before so I'm thinking a new chef? I've gotten the chicken breast kabab before and that was ok but a little dry so this time I got the Kabab Kobideh which was amazing! Super juicy! It was ground beef so kind of reminded me of a long burger patty with better seasoning. I also tried the Kabab Barg which were strips of beef. The plate didn't have that many on it. It was also kind of chewy but still very juicy. Rice was plain. Grilled tomato was a nice touch. Onion was still hard. Would have liked it cooked down a little more."

I know taking food for take out tastes a bit different than dining in, but I was still expecting it to taste a bit better.

Â The hummus was good but the eggplant was a little bit flavorless. Had the ground beef kebab whIch was nice and juicy. The lamb kebab was cooked to medium, but still felt a little dry.Ignore the fake tree trunk in the resto. It's good solid food."

You wouldn't think about ordering that at a diner but give the food a try, you won't be disappointed. Also, not only is the food great but the service is great as well. The manager always comes over to see how your meal is and if you need anything and the wait staff is phenomenal. Elizabeth is probably the best waitress you will ever encounter.

The ambiance was very nice I ordered the big man breakfast and my co-worker ordered the lumber jack meal. All in all, the food was okay. It was a little on the cold side but perhaps it was just our order. The orange juice is also not refillable. Also, the parking lot is very small for the size of the establishment so be aware that you may have to park on the street. Overall the place wasn't bad but I wouldn't drool over wanting to return.

Â We sat at a table and the first thing I noticed was the noise level was very high. Â I felt like I was screaming just to talk to my friend. Â The server was very pleasant as we both ordered a cheeseburger deluxe. Â I ordered extra onions on mine.The server came back with drinks and a small serving of cole slaw. Â About 10-15 minutes later our food arrived. Â The size of the bun was twice as big as the meat. Â The french fries were not golden brown but tasted well. Â  Â The cole slaw had sugar in it? Â Why was there sugar in it, that's gross!The onion I got stunk so I didn't add it to the burger. Â My first bite... tasteless, like cardboard. Â It's almost impossible I thought to completely screw up a cheeseburger but this place did it.So a bit later we ordered dessert. Â My friend ordered rice pudding and I ordered chocolate pudding.The rice pudding was watery and the chocolate pudding was bitter, not fresh and smelled funny. Â Oh boy I thought! Â So the check comes and they charged me $0.75 for extra onion? Â Are they insane?Welp, for a tasteless, bitter, non-fresh meal served in a noise-ridden environment I rate this place 1/5.

80,Gh4TyhJSqL_24fplLvVpGw,7/15/2017,4 star rating,My family wanted to check out the Chinatown while in New York and came across this restaurant. For a Chinese restaurant the service was quite fast and the food was yummy. Our server was a humorous lady full of enthusiasm which was great after a tiring day of walking around.
81,Gh4TyhJSqL_24fplLvVpGw,6/12/2017,5 star rating,"This is my go-to whenever I'm craving Chinese. I've come here so much and ordered the same dish that the servers know what my regular order is...which iiiiiiis an authentic Chinese dish that's pig intestine with pickled veggies over rice. I know. Sounds disgusting esp if you're not familiar with authentic Chinese cuisine. But I would recommend you give it a try if you like chewy textured foods. Their BBQ duck and pork are pretty good, and their prices make it SOOOO worth it. My beloved pig intestine dish with rice is only $5 and the BBQ rice dishes are also only around $6-7. The interior also is clean (esp for being in Chinatown) and service is fast. DEFINITELY recommend if you're into authentic Chinese food. Remember to carry cash though since this place, like most places in Chinatown is cash only."
82,Gh4TyhJSqL_24fplLvVpGw,3/16/2018,4 star rating,"Authentic Chinese food with not too much MSG in your food. If you are looking for quick, good and cheap, here's the deal. They are open till 10pm which is later than most restaurants in the heart of Chinatown. We usually do family style here and the pot rice is definitely good for its price. I recommend the pepper beef on the sizzling plate, not too fatty, but not chewy either. The salt and pepper fried pork is also great here too, not too fatty but fried to crisp. Fried tofu comes freshly fried so be careful not to bite into it right away. Fried fish and tofu over rice is a typical Chinese comfort food and they made that pretty good here as well. Definitely will come back."
83,Gh4TyhJSqL_24fplLvVpGw,8/2/2016,4 star rating,"A standard in Chinatown. Â Food is always good, and the price is excellent.

With little time to decide, walked into this place since it was relatively spacious/not busy at the time (Sat. afternoon).Ordered the pork with rice and tofu with asparagus. Food took about 20 minutes to come out, but the complementary tea was nice. Pork - a little on the chewy side, but was tender and the sauce was excellent. Tofu - bland, as it didn't soak up the flavors of the dish well, asparagus was good though. The place is well-staffed and has a nice location near the Chinatown buses, but the food isn't memorable enough to come back."

Most of the prices here are pretty great (in particular, you can get an order of è ç² for only $2.50, which I recommend).The cool thing about this place also is that considering the low prices, the place is very clean and doesn't leave anything to be desired in the area of service or hygiene wise."

I won't say Forest Hills/Kew Gardens as well, simply because there are far too many little bagel shops for me to try them all out, but certainly, it's the best in the area. Far better than Hot Bialys or Gotta Get a Bagel.Their bagels are nice and crusty on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside - just perfect. Their everything bagels are delicious and they have an excellent assortment of cheese spreads.Their scallion cream cheese is second to none and they make a heavenly cinnamon/raisin/walnut cream cheese spread that'll make you wanna slap your momma!Their cookies and assorted pastry fare are buttery, flaky and rich, but it's the bagels and bialys that are the hot ticket.They open at 5:30 AM if you're the early bird type, but definitely do go before 7 AM, as the bagels are fresher and there's little to no line. You might even get a little table. :-)"

(Note, gentlement: you should find a line better than ""bebeee is dat an iphone"" if you're trying to pick up girls-in a bagel store- on a Saturday morning)After you've paid for your bagel with vegetable tofu-spread (yes its a delicious Â alternative on the lactose free scene), make sure that its actually what you ordered, and not something totally from left field like, oh, say tuna. (One time I didn't check and I got to work and let's just say it was disgusting.) Also make sure that the coffee is sealed tightly. Other times, my order was correct, but it was baptised in coffee before I had a chance to eat it. Bagelette, under the days of old owners Sam & Isaac was AWESOME. Its now changed hands twice since 2006. They still serve a beautiful selection of spreads, salads & appetizing. Their pastries are decent, but not made on premises. The bagels, while a varied selection, are far from the doughy treats they once were. When Organic Market is closed, Bagelette is a mere consolation prize for breakfast on the run."

We ordered the mixed basket, which is half orders of wings, jalapeÃ±o poppers, chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, onion rings and curly fries. I would say this could feeds 2-3 people depending on your hunger. It's a nice healthy mix of your favorite bar good snacks. We also ordered the Belly Bangers which essentially 3 mini cheeseburger sliders. I thought these were pretty good too. GK's is definitely a place you want to be at during NFL Sunday. Good food, good beer, and plenty of games to watch."

They have a huge selection, and cleverly have several TV screens detailing each keg, when it was tapped and how much is left in the keg, as well as descriptions of the beer's taste and style.I've always had a warm, friendly welcome from the staff every time I come, and find the atmosphere inside to be laid back and inviting. It's a great bar to hang out in and try many beers."

Even though I don't live as close to it as I did back then, I'll still come here every few weeks when I want a good beer in a low key environment.GK always has a quality selection of 20 or so beers on tap, with a variety that includes something for everyone. They also have wine and spirits, but I'd call them a beer bar above all else.Service is solid at the bar, usually very quick and friendly. It can be a little slower for table service, but still not too bad. Food is good as far as bars go, it'll do the trick if you're looking for something straightforward to eat. And there's free popcorn in the corner (self-serve) to hold you over while waiting for entrees, or just to munch on while you drink.TVs throughout the space, it's a good place to watch sports. Come here for a few beers with friends, or for a cold solo brew while watching the game."

The bar wasn't packed but every bar seat was taken and 2 tables were occupied as well. There was 1 waiter and 1 bartender that I saw.No one greeted me right away, but as soon as Bridgette the bartender saw me she acknowledged me. $8 for Garlic Fries well worth it. Apparently the fries are hand cut! So that's a major plus. Tasty and filling the garlic topping is garlic butter, parsley & Parmesan cheese. Fries not your typical crunchy, more on the soft flimsy side but packed with flavor.Very good. I ordered curry sauce on the side not necessary but a good compliment. They have other French fry options Truffle fries Curly Fries Everything Bagel Â -- A must try Garlic FriesCurry Fries"
117,go9fTb59h5WJ_e5Guw-Y8g,12/26/2017,3 star rating,"George Keeley is the OG beer bar on the UWS. Â I've heard about it for years, but hadn't tried it despite living up here for ~2 years. Â Finally got the occasion recently when meeting a friend for a movie. Â It looks like your typical Irish bar. Â The only differentiator was the tap display on the big screen that showed how much of each beer was left. Â In summary, lots of IPAs. Â Nothing truly special on tap, just a who's who of beer bar staples: think Troegs, Brooklyn, Smutty Nose, plus the obligatory Other Half. Â This may have flew for a beer bar 10 years ago, but with heavy hitters like Bondurants popping up and old standbys like Rattle & Hum stepping it up, this ain't cutting it anymore.Would come by again to give this another shot as it was totally fine, but I'm not rushing back as it wasn't anything special either. Â Maybe the food is good too? Â Service was decent but no different than your typical bar on the UWS. Â Kind of confused considering the raves as this place certainly has its fanbase. Â I say meh."

No frills, great vibes!We planned a party for a group of 15-20 people and the team at George Keeley were so accommodating. They gave us this great little space (called the stage) so it's slightly elevated from the bar. It was perfect for our group to park and keep their stuff, and gave us a designated space to hang. I was able to arrive early and decorate the area. As soon as I arrived the whole staff introduced themselves, meanwhile the bar was pretty busy... brownie points! Especially in NYC it's difficult to find such a friendly and cool team like they have here- specifically Sergio who helped me plan the evening, and Beatrice (""B"") and Zach were amazing!! It was also very helpful that they allowed the whole group to open separate tabs, which makes things MUCH easier when dealing with such a big group. The platters they offer are really reasonably priced, I was shocked! And it is an outrageous amount of food (in the best way possible)... We ordered the chicken wings and the sliders (mixed with cheeseburgers and pulled pork)- all so good!! They all took such good care of us and made everyone feel right at home. The experience, staff, and food made the night unforgettable- we will be making this place a regular spot! Thank you again Sergio, Beatrice & Zach for making this night so great! Can't wait to be back again soon :)"

161,y9GhIt1MLh6344ODA65NQw,7/25/2020,4 star rating,"I had been eyeing this place for a very long time with its bright awnings and cute little tables outside. So I decided to treat myself to lunch with friends to day. Though ordering process is very simple, walk up to the window in order then take a seat in wait. When your order is ready they call you or they may even bring it to your table. The quality of the food is very good. Everything tastes fresh and healthy. The prices are a little steep for the portions but you know businesses have been struggling (suck it up buttercup, we need good takeout). I ordered the fish taco, the chicken taco (so tasty), and the organic Brown rice and beans.I also had the matcha latte which was very good (ceremonial grade) whisked right in front of you. They have multiple milk options which was a plus for me. I would definitely have it again."
162,y9GhIt1MLh6344ODA65NQw,4/16/2021,5 star rating,"This BedStuy staple packs a full flavor punch! Blending Japanese and Mexican cuisines together as one for a party in your mouth! The set up is casual with some outdoor dining available as well as pick up and delivery. The menu ranges from tacos to ramen. I opted for the Japanese plate with salted mackerel. It came with rice, miso soup, & Japanese pickles. All delicious and fresh! The salted mackerel was crispy yet moist and a pretty substantial size. My friend ordered the Warude curry which had fried fish and shrimp with brown curry and rice. Everything was hot and delicious! The menu switches up from time to time with added tacos and combinations. This place can get pretty busy throughout the day/night but we probably waited no longer than 12 minutes for the food which was great!"

I didn't dine, but ordered delivery from them and the customer service was excellent. Shout out to Jun. The food was even better. I had the basic curry with a panko'd protein. The curry was thick and flavorful. I got the salmon taco and the vegetable dumpling soup. The dumplings in the soup are bursting with some sort of pea and carrot veggies. Loved it. Mango salsa on the salmon taco, yum. Tons of meat. See for your self."

Eric, if you have been coming here for 15 years, I don't understand how you can only give it 3 stars. You have other Chinese restaurants on the island that definitely deserve a 3.The food here isn't over oiled and you can actually taste the sesame in the sesame chicken. The boneless spare ribs are amazing, the best I have tried (That's right! I said it).Give it a whirl, you won't be disappointed."
216,ft4-eCqO3kukSCsOChMV_g,9/1/2014,1 star rating,"The worst place to eat, never coming here again. we ordered seafood and veges over noodles . The scallop went bad and we love seafood . We told the waiter that it went bad and he told us ok I waive the soup that you ordered . I told him that we want another dish with out the scallop , he said he can't do that and was confused . He told the boss to come out ,she came out and took the scallops to the back to let the chef taste it . When the boss came back out she said that the scallop came yesterday and is fresh, it taste just like that. Â The boss didn't offer us to make a new dish without scallop , she only said that is how it taste and left . I never received such bad service in my life . Would not recommend anyone to come here"

220,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,6/18/2020,5 star rating,"This place is delicioussss. Their large cup is quite funny and very different which is one of the reasons why I come here. Their tea is JASMINE tea. When I come here and get the passionfruit jasmine tea, the tea is more fragrant and flowery than the regular/traditional passionfruit green tea. Every other bbt place only has passionfruit GREEN tea. They also have a variety of snacks like popcorn chicken, fries, and sushi- all of which I have yet to try. The prices here are also very reasonable for the tastiness of the drinks/food. There's a Anda Cafe in Elmhurst and in the heart of Flushing but Elmhurst is far from where I live and it's very hard to find parking in ""Flushing Flushing"". I'm very glad they opened one on the outskirts of Flushing where parking can be found (even if that means having to double park). Will be returning."

222,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,8/29/2019,2 star rating,"I don't mind that they only take cash at this place. Â I have three problems at this location. Â First problem that I saw, is that they only have one person does the mix of the drinks and take orders, and another person make sushis. Â I have to wait for awhile to order and get my drink. Â Second problem is that the guy who took my order, doesn't look like he wants to be there at all. Â Last problem is that the drink doesn't taste like I ordered. I don't taste any honey in it. Â And top of that, the drink is lukewarm even I asked for no ice. Â It supposes to be cold drink. Â That's why I'm going them two stars for this place."
223,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,4/14/2019,2 star rating,"I tried their jasmine milk tea with bubbles, and here's what I thought:1. You can choose between ice cold, less ice, or no ice. I opted for less ice and there wasn't a single ice cube in my drink. 2. If you are used to the super sweet aka diabetes-in-a-cup milk tea at typical chain milk tea spots and typically order ""30% sweet"" to get a normal level of sweetness, try ordering 75% sweet here. Trust. I got 50% sweet because I didn't know better and it was a little on the bland side. 3. I found the bubbles to be a tad too mushy in my opinion. Could be chewier. Also, no sago (xi mi lu) option. Sad. 4. They have generous sizes. Their ""small"" is what I would consider a regular, and their ""medium"" is what I'd consider a large. Their ""large"" is like a bucket. Who is gonna drink an entire bucket of bubble tea? If you're a regular person, a small is plenty. At $3.50 for a small, this is pretty reasonable compared to other places. Overall not impressed. I got a room temperature drink with mushy bubbles."
224,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,4/23/2019,5 star rating,"Okay this little spot is new to Main Street. But the bubble tea.... damn is good. They have this Thai tea mix with this purple milk thing omg to die for. It also has a sushi area and let me say they are fresh and clean. And they work around what you want. Â I had the Philadelphia roll and damn, so good. So this week I can't eat meat so I told them no crab meat and add cucumber and it was real good. I have also tried there dragon roll. Also amazing. So Â for being a new place it's looking good. Friendly staff and if you need a sample of flavor for tea they good. So my friends let me know what you think. Keep it tasty and let me know."

Their teas are great here, and the food is good from what I've had so far. I prefer this over Chatime any day. I also had the Green Apple Oolong tea which was interesting as well. Would definitely recommend this boba place."
226,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,12/27/2019,1 star rating,Had the chicken and the fries along with the apple lemon with lychee. The fries tasted soggy like they were microwaved and i remember school chicken nuggets being a lot better than theirs. The quantity for the price isn't worth it either. The cup for the drink is so cute but isn't worth 3.50 for a small. The only thing good about this meal was the drink but wouldn't get again because of how tiny it is. The average size of a males dong is longer than the small cup.
227,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,4/9/2019,4 star rating,"This Cafe recently opened a month, almost two months ago. The bubble tea is not the best but it's still good. Since there's a school near by, students have the opportunies to stop by and order bubble teas or spend time with their friends together, eat sushi, food. Though, they are a bit slow at things which is understandable because they are short on workers, they should hire some people. Furthermore, Â it's probably their first time working. I wish they add popping bobas as a topping. I believe it could improve in some space."

230,Aa934EMuqCdEV86faZG-0A,5/14/2017,2 star rating,Came here hoping to fulfill a chocolate craving. I got the Raspberry chocolate cake and was disappointed. The cake was dry/stale and the raspberries in the moose we're frozen. Â It was not tasty so save the calorie intake. My sister got the peach cheesecake. It was crumbly and thick. Before I ordered anything I purchased the poppyseed roll based on yelp reviews. I'm sure itll be delicious. 2 stars because coffee was good.

Croussants, danishes, macaroons, Polish cookies are all fresh and priced low for the neighborhood. You can have a coffee and turkey-cream cheese croissant for a very fresh and fulfilling breakfast there (for only a couple of bucks)."

Â I'm in LOVE, they are chewy, hard outside, soft chewy inside and most importantly the prices aren't inflated like some other places out there. Â  The croissants are buttery and flakey Â the plain and ham and cheese are my favs. Â Tiramisu, cheese cake, cappuccino cake all for $3 a slice all delightful, sweet but not overly sweet for my ""buds"".

Favorite aspects are the charismatic bartenders (with whom I've taken many a complimentary shot), hula hoops, funky 80s/90s music, and Jenga. The crowd is young but polite and the staff seems like they want patrons to have fun. I always do! So glad to be near this bar.

So we walked into this bar to grab quick drink. Sadly, this bar left a bad taste in my mouth and my friend who had just arrived from another state got a terrible impression of NYC bartenders. A female bartender at this bar barked at us for not listening to her question clearly and made a scene. She was obviously very attentive to the locals at this bar. Honestly, very unprofessional for her assuming we understand what she said and the drink was terrible, I think she did it on purpose. Bad customer service and disrespectful bartender who humiliated us. My mother was a bartending manager for over a decade and I know she would never tolerate an employee speaking to a customer with such disrespect for a misunderstanding. Clearly, this woman needs a customer service intervention course. Please don't go. Spend your money where people are kind and attentive... with much better drinks!"

Â I didn't come here so much for drinking or socializing but rather to see very specific bands play. Most of the time, I was being polite and under obligation.Cut to the new name/same premise of Bob's Your Uncle. Love the name, adorbs. It's the kind of bar that makes you feel like you're not even in Manhattan, in a good way. The drinks are cheap. A cider was $6. But the whole place is super cheap. I wish the place was a little cleaner. But if you're with cheap out of town friends, living on a budget yourself or a fan of dive bars, Bob's is definitely worth a visit."

Â I've gone on all different days of the week and have experienced different bartenders. Â Each time they all are pleasant to deal with. Â Their cocktails are delish and they have a great rotating draft beer selection. Â Although they dont serve food you are allowed to bring your own in or order to the location. Â The decor is that of wood, from the flooring to the tables. Â It's a spot that you can go to by yourself and not feel weird about it. Â I have done so & have always met friendly patrons.Oh and they are dog friendly."

My friends booked the place for 2 hours Saturday afternoon with an open bar for their son's party. What an awesome spot! It was spacious enough for everyone in our party to mingle and hang out - as well as for my little niece to run around and subsequently nap when she was worn out. The bartender was super friendly and it felt like he was part of the party. But the beer - wow, talk about a stellar list of rotating craft brews! I tried 3 and each was better than the one before. Unfortunately I don't remember the names but I did have the Bob's own brew and it was delicious! Once our party ended, we stayed to hang and continue drinking with the locals who came on in. I was bummed when I had to leave to go run some errands. I have some friends who live in the area and would definitely go back to this spot!"

Stopped in here on a Tuesday night and there were less than 20 customers at the bar, yet the bartender was completely flustered, not to mention distracted by the - what looked like - locals. Got a beer and a shot of Jameson, and the Jameson was NOT Jameson. They must fill their bottles...but that shit that they call Jameson, is not it. I should know...I am a rep for the company. I love dogs, and have one myself, but barking dogs in a bar on a Tuesday night? What??? Lot of creeps in this bar, it has an extremely seedy vibe. Saw some guy dealing coke in the dark corner near the bathrooms in the back to the bartender and customers. I was there with a friend (who is a cop) and he was not impressed. Gross."

Once our boots filled with water we tossed our plans out the window and focused on a cozy place.The drafts here are very reasonable for NYC, the bar is spacious and clean, and there are some good seating/standing options. They even had the Olympics on the screen. The board games were fun but only for casuals. We ended up playing connect four (and turning it in to a drinking game, duh) and Guess Who because my date was French and the rest were mostly pun games.Everyone was friendly and the bartenders were even nice enough to lend two plastic bags to us for our wet accoutrements."

Good times."
247,MPV-rSjFjfxJDjOV97NwUw,2/13/2018,3 star rating,"Meh. That is all. Additional thoughts - stopping here on a random Tuesday when it wasn't crowded only to watch the bartenders chat with each other for 5-10 minutes before scanning the bar for customers who want to spend money. NYC is loaded with average bars and this doesn't stand out - it's not horrible, just nothing whatsoever stands out in any way."

From what I've read below his name is Angelo.Here it goes.That very day I was given the go ahead by my oral surgeon (I had bone surgery 4 days prior) to eat regular food so on my way home I stopped at Tony's. My mouth was still swollen and I was still unable to make many normal facial expressions, but who cares, I was ordering pizza and garlic knots for my boyfriend and I. I ordered 2 slices from the young man behind the counter and when he stepped away Angelo walked up. I asked Angelo to add 3 garlic knots to my order. Angelo says, ""What order?"". I tell him ""the order I just placed with the man behind you"". Angelo says, ""how am I supposed to know that?"" I'm thinking to myself, JUST GET ME MY GARLIC KNOTS GUY, but I refrain because well, I have manners. Then Angelo puts the pizza box on top of the counter and to call me over says, ""Ok smiley it's $17.75."" Clearly he was being sarcastic, and quite frankly very rude and upsetting, because I PHYSICALLY COULD NOT SMILE. So I pay him and I say, ""I'm not smiling because I just had oral surgery and cannot move my face."" As I was walking out I heard a woman say to him, ""I guess you won't be saying that to anyone else anytime soon"" and Angelo replied, ""why not?""I was only at Tony's on 1 other occasion and was reminded why I never went back there. And to think I paid $17.75 for 2 slices of pizza and 3 garlic knots and I ended up leaving there on the verge of tears. Forget about Tony's and head over to Pizza Mia - everything they have there (pizza, garlic knots, service, price, etc) is better."

Order calamari, I don't eat seafood but my son an husband does, they weren't empresses either, I felt bad an disappointed for them.I hear so many great thing about this place an I wanted to like it so bad, I guess I'll give them one more try an see if it does it for me."

I would say that the food here is absolutely fantastic five star a five-star and so is the price. And so is the service. I would 100% go back here when I go back to New York without a doubt in my mind. The falafel was crispy and delicious and all the toppings really taste like back home in Israel.

They did NOT skimp on the meat, which was very juicy and didn't feel too heavy, and the pita was stuffed to the brim.Keep in mind the pita is not fresh and even though the sandwich is stuffed, it is still quite small for a full meal. The price (~$11) is also a bit expensive for a pita sandwich but after all, this is the UWS and it still is cheaper than many of the other options in the area."

Their hot sauce is my favorite hot sauce ever. That stuff is very addictive. To make the dining experience even better, the guys who work at Sido are incredibly nice."
268,Aa934EMuqCdEV86faZG-0A,8/23/2019,2 star rating,Alittle disappointed in this place. The falafels were actually pretty good. Crisp and fresh. Wish I would have had the hummus with it.Pita was thin and the salad was fresh but composed as a sandwich it didn't compliment each other well. Maybe missing a sauce? Tahini I think was involved and we had hot sauce on the side but each bite was either just salad or salad and falafel which was a bit plain.Wife tried a lamb sandwich and that too was disappointing. Lamb tasted a little overdone and didn't have a savory taste to it. Found her sprinkling salt on top but I don't think it made a big difference. The Falafel was better. Would try a hummus plate next time as given the area it was very well priced.

I got to the counter and still had to wait a bit, which was fine. I watched the barista making the drinks - I then saw her pour soy milk into the metal measuring cup (marked SOY) to steam it. I kept watching when I knew it wasn't my drink she was making, because she was using soy. I saw her pour, steam, pour, cover the drink and then place it on the counter in front of me and call out my name and mobile order. I asked her if it was made with ALMOND milk, just to hear her response when I clearly saw her use Soy. To my surprise she said yes. Â I was so mortified- why would you bold faced lie like that?????? It was so ridiculous!! I have never had an issue like that in any Starbucks - if they make the drink wrong they remake it. I will not be going make here again with dishonest people. Because what if I am not there to catch her mistake/lie - That behavior is so dangerous, people ask for certain milk options for health reasons - I simple cannot have soy, it makes me sick and gives me headaches. The next person could have a worse issue. I HOPE THEY SEE THIS AND CORRECT THEIR STAFF ABOUT LYING TO CUSTOMERS....I will not be going back to this location ever!!! If I can't trust them to make the drink correctly they simply won't get my money!!!!!"

I approached the counter and three staff members - all young men - were dancing around and having a good time. I waited alone patiently to be served and these three staff members looked at me and continued to dance around and ignore me, even though they could see me waiting. Then their supervisor, who was standing by the counter drinking a coffee, told them to serve me.One of the guys begrudgingly served me.By this point I was a little angry. It wasn't that I had waited but more that they had all made eye contact and chosen to willfully ignore me. I said to the server that I was a little upset to be ignored and he didn't respond verbally at all. Instead he served my coffee with attitude. Typical American behavior. Instead of apologizing he was pissed off at me. Probably because he got told off by his supervisor. I challenged him. ""Oh that's it? You're not going to verbally respond to me?"" At that point he ignored me and talked with a big smile to the woman behind me. Ultimately ignoring me and minimizing me. Everywhere you go in America, you are reminded that you don't matter and if you have any complaints be ready to experience aggressive behavior and to be gaslighted. I walked out of Starbucks paranoid that this dude had spat in my coffee. I was furious for all of two minutes. Then I let it go.Because this kind of horrible customer service is everyday in New York. You simply don't matter here. That's the reality. Even getting a cup of coffee is an opportunity for someone to remind you of that. Thank you Starbucks for reminding me of how little I matter and how little your staff cares. Why should they? It's only coffee right?

I usually am dead set against chains, but being able to do a mobile order om the train on my way from Brooklyn to Shetler Studio is a life-saver. This evening I ordered my usual but ended up walking from the Times Square area, took forever. I got there, no order. I was so ready for an argument or battle or something and instead they said they made it, pitched it because it was getting warm and gross, and dropped everything to make me a new one. It was the same kind of service I expect from a mom and pop place that knows me. Also I observed a new person being trained and I noticed the woman training her was being exacting but also encouraging and kind. Even though there was training going on, they were adequately staffed to provide quick and efficient service, keeping the line moving. I will definitely feel better about making an exception to my no-chain rule and patronizing Starbucks, especially this one, in the future.

I said to the server that I was a little upset to be ignored and he didn't respond verbally at all. Instead he served my coffee with attitude. Typical American behavior. Instead of apologizing he was pissed off at me. Probably because he got told off by his supervisor. I challenged him. ""Oh that's it? You're not going to verbally respond to me?"" At that point he ignored me and talked with a big smile to the woman behind me. Ultimately ignoring me and minimizing me. Everywhere you go in America, you are reminded that you don't matter and if you have any complaints be ready to experience aggressive behavior and to be gaslighted. I walked out of Starbucks paranoid that this dude had spat in my coffee. I was furious for all of two minutes. Then I let it go.Because this kind of horrible customer service is everyday in New York. You simply don't matter here. That's the reality. Even getting a cup of coffee is an opportunity for someone to remind you of that. Thank you Starbucks for reminding me of how little I matter and how little your staff cares. Why should they? It's only coffee right? And it's good training to be an American.The less you care for others the more American you are."

I got to the counter and still had to wait a bit, which was fine. I watched the barista making the drinks - I then saw her pour soy milk into the metal measuring cup (marked SOY) to steam it. I kept watching when I knew it wasn't my drink she was making, because she was using soy. I saw her pour, steam, pour, cover the drink and then place it on the counter in front of me and call out my name and mobile order. I asked her if it was made with ALMOND milk, just to hear her response when I clearly saw her use Soy. To my surprise she said yes. Â I was so mortified- why would you bold faced lie like that?????? It was so ridiculous!! I have never had an issue like that in any Starbucks - if they make the drink wrong they remake it. I will not be going make here again with dishonest people. Because what if I am not there to catch her mistake/lie - That behavior is so dangerous, people ask for certain milk options for health reasons - I simple cannot have soy, it makes me sick and gives me headaches. The next person could have a worse issue. I HOPE THEY SEE THIS AND CORRECT THEIR STAFF ABOUT LYING TO CUSTOMERS....I will not be going back to this location ever!!! If I can't trust them to make the drink correctly they simply won't get my money!!!!!"

Located in the heart of midtown, you would think this Starbucks branch would be able to handle an abundant amount of people. If I'm waiting 15 minutes for a drink (literally, I actually timed this), then you know there's a major problem. I notice that the baristas behind the counter are more concerned with gossiping about each others lives than doing their jobs.The ones that are working, however, are so unorganized and ridiculously slow! There are 7 people behind the counter, laughing and gossiping (you can hear their conversations loud and clear), but it takes you 15 minutes to make my drink? Your location is key, people have to get back to work.Unfortunately, that's just one of the many issues with this Starbucks. My advise, avoid this place completely. You'll thank me in the long run. If it weren't conveniently located in my building, I would avoid it as well."

Â Apparently, it's more important for baristas to have in-depth conversations with one another than to give receipts when they are requested, and I found myself in quite the predicament later in the day. Â A different barista was downstairs, and had the audacity to tell me that I wasn't there earlier in the day (because I'm secretly a homeless person with an empty Starbucks coffee cup stash, YOU GOT ME THERE.). Â I gave her the physical description of the barista who served me earlier that morning, who she pulled out of the back office. Â The barista who had served me looks at me and says that she's never seen me before. Â Um, are you on drugs that you have no recollection that I'm here every day? Â If so, I want some of whatever you're taking! Â So the two of them refused to give me a refill which I was going to PAY for and refused to serve me.

After navigating through some quiet side streets, all of a sudden Erin's Isle popped up and we gave it a try.This place is a weird mix between old school Italian and an Irish pub. When we first walked in I noticed the main dining area was somewhat empty. Not dead, but not the kind of business you would expect for a Saturday night. Instead of being seated there, we were brought to a private dining area where we were all alone. Well, almost alone. There were 2 men sitting alone discussing what looked to be serious business. Faces were 12"" apart, talking low, stone cold. Looked like someone was being given ""an offer they couldn't refuse"" if you know what I mean.. Great first impressions so far! We took our seats and began our evening.Took a little while for our waiter to come. (Maybe b\c we were seated in the spot of the restaurant where no one ever gets seated??) Eventually Mike Sorrentino's (google it) stunt double showed up and took our drink orders. That's great, except he didn't bring menus. No joke, took about 10 mins before we even got menus. I'll cut him some slack though, turned out to be a nice guy.When we eventually ordered, 2 of my friends ordered the chicken rollatini. No big deal, right? Well the waiter comes back and says ""sorry we only have one left"" ..what?!? An Italian restaurant, early on a Saturday night, only has 1 left? First off, kind of a bush league thing to happen. Secondly, umm no thanks but i don't want your LAST chicken rollatini which has probably been festering around for 4 days. Fast forwarding a bit. The food took a pretty long time to come and really wasn't anything special. We all agreed our dishes were OK, not amazing. The prices were a little high but not crazy. You do you get large portions so that helped.For those of you who gave this place a 4 or 5 star rating, please. You must be accustomed to eating at Red Lobster for fine cuisine. The decor resembles an old age home and their thermostat is a bit wonky. Also, be on the look out for the bus boy with the long hair. Also a nice guy, just needs a trim."

Â For an entree I had the shrimp parmigiana. Â Large in size, but pales in comparison to one you would find at say Carmines. Â Theirs was more of the Swanson tv dinner variety. Â Sauce was mediocre and cheese was globby. Â Side blue cheese salad was weak as well.Other minuses, my uncle wanted a side Caesar salad and offered to pay extra and was denied. Â My aunt ordered her pasta primavera with rigatoni instead of spaghetti and they served it with spaghetti. Â She had to wait over 5 minutes for a new order. Â The waitress did make up for her mistake by giving us a delicious slice of cheesecake to share for the table with our coffee.I feel bad giving them 2 stars because we did enjoy a nice bottle of Rodney Strong merlot and the company was great.

Â The basket included yummy slices of bread, flatbread, and breadsticks. Â It is definitely not for the carb counters. :)Oh, back to the calamari. Â It was crispy on the outside, but moist (and not chewy like other places) on the inside. Â The marinara sauce was a simple sauce which didn't overpower the calamari. Â You could probably make a meal out of a salad and just calamari! Â Speaking of the salads here, my brother and mom each got one as a side dish and they were HUGE! We each got a variety of entrees from veal marsala to salmon to Chilean sea bass to angel hair pasta with every meat under the sun.

Lovely ambience, very relaxing. The service was courteous, prompt and professional. Everyone was super friendly. They even sent over a free glass of wine. The food was not outstanding but very solid. We tried the stuffed clams, burrata which was so creamy and tasty - amazing, my daughter had the carbonara which she really enjoyed. I had the seafood spaghetti which was good, not great, and very generous with the seafood. I always judge an Italian place by the quality of bread and olive oil and this place was very good on both.

I checked out their soups and the choices didn't seem appealing to me at the time. Â So I sauntered my way over to their hot and cold food bar. Â I grabbed some vegetable chow fun one vegetable spring rill, some oven roasted string beans and 2 chicken wing pieces (1 drumette, 1 wingette). Â The price was $6.99/lb and it came up to $4.71 with tax.The chicken was crispy but not too flavorful. I loved the string beans because they had that caramelized roasted flavor which you get when you roast at high heat."
365,8oHCb-XvLpqCQD7En17Fzw,3/1/2016,1 star rating,Been going here for months. Get tuna sandwich. Every week it's gone up one dollar every time I pay. They argue with their customers about it. I have no problem paying for what it's worth but know your prices. Put them up on the board. Now they started to charge for their little turd pickles. You charge 8 bucks for sandwich give a pickle. Probably going out of business so your picking pennies anywhere u could to pay rent. Â Oh and the department of health will be called as your buffet is going to kill someone at 9pm at night. It's rotten and overcooked. U cannot serve food like that. Saw two roaches in the back. Get it together. Your in tribeca
366,8oHCb-XvLpqCQD7En17Fzw,5/5/2016,1 star rating,"very disappointed Â have been eating here since their doors open and today I was truly disappointed. I was not totally hungry so I just wanted a little salad to have with my Empanarda Â from the open salad bar, my salad came to a little less than $2.00 I ask the guy behind the counter for a small container to put some salad dressing in, I went to the register and was told by the Asian cashier that the next time if my salad is not over 2 bucks I would have to pour the dressing over the salad. first off I don't like a soggy salad and I was walking back to the office so what she is telling me is I would have to spend a certain amount because the boss does not want that, I did not want to argue. as I told her not to worry I will not be back, I can spend my money else where."

About 3 times a week I come here and order a whole wheat wrap with: eggwhites, onions, peppers, cheddar cheese, and avocado, doused in sriracha sauce. Its quite delicious. Not as crazy about their lunch options. The sandwiches are decent but i normally just stick to getting breakfast here."
370,8oHCb-XvLpqCQD7En17Fzw,10/29/2013,1 star rating,"Yikes. From the outside, this place appears to have some potential to satisfy your hunger. Do not be fooled. The vast expanse of meal options I saw from the doorway is what drew me in at 11:00 at night when nothing else was open. The food, however, is overpriced standard deli fare, and the other options looked unappetizing. I ordered a tuna melt (which was given to me cold with unmelted cheese) for $8.17 (+tax). I just should have gone home and heated up my kale and pasta. The sandwich was a waste of money and calories. I do judge a deli based on their capacity to make a proper tuna melt (with MELTED, and I repeat, MELTED cheese; if you can't do that, then don't lie to me and say you can, as I will write a scathing review of your place of business). This place has so much machinery behind the deli counter, yet they're really failing to even make the most standard of sandwiches.I will not be back, and I'd advise anyone to stay away."

You definitely have to get their right after they begin putting the food out because once you arrive later all the food has been manhandled by other buyers. I've never complained about anything in the food, its alway up to my taste standards. It's also very fast paced. You go in buy your food and you're out the door!"

The sauce on the orange chicken was banging. It was very tangy so not sure what it is made of. The noodles wasn't what I had expected as it has curry sauce, it wasn't spicy at all, has egg and some seafood in it too. I probably wouldn't order it again, but I'll be back."

It used to be the go to place after a night of dancing at the Zodoo nightclub 10+ years ago. But now, this place has fallen off! They make you pay extra for the sides. For example you order fried fish/chicken etc, they charge you $2+ for the attieke, fried yams or whatever you want to eat it with. It's RIDICULOUS! That's a scam! Not to mention the quality of the food they serve is subpar to say the least ! Do yourself a favor, and go west to La Savane!

Â Too late/hungry/drunk, need to just grab something quick. Â Real nonsense.So last night I find myself in the position to pick where I wanted to dine on my birthday. Â Of all the fancypants restaurants (and it's restaurant week after all!), I instead chose to stick close to my pad, but venture away from the usual burrito joint (it was however, a hard choice to make, after my male companion and I had a long discussion on the merits of Italian cuisine.)So, we ventured out to New Ivoire, nervous, about to lose our Ivoirian-cuisine virginities. Â When we arrived the place was very busy, lots of cabbies, all talking amongst themselves loudly, over a TV blaring some dance show on BET. Â Totally. Awesome. Â We took a table in the corner and excitedly poured over the menu. Â I had a serious dilemma in deciding what to order. Â I really wanted the fried tuna, because tuna is the most delicious fish to ever swim the seas. Â But i really like my tuna raw, I kinda hate cooked tuna. Â On the Â other hand, I could get the grilled lamb. Â In the end I decided to be bold and get the tuna, with a side of frites served with their own spicy home made ketchup. Â (In hindsight, I would have gotten something else, but I do have a serious french fry addiction. Â They were damn good fries, too.) Â My companion ordered the wednesday lunch special lamb with brown rice.We also both ordered their 'homemade ginger drink.' Â It was a very sweet lemonade with a strong (very spicy!) ginger flavor. Â I couldn't believe what a good digestif this drink was! Â Really tasty as well, though I would cut it with seltzer to make it a bit less sweet and easier to drink.My tuna was really fantastic. Â It wasn't breaded, just seasoned and thrown right in the oil. Â This resulted in a very crisp outer layer that was salty and delicious and not overly greasy. Â The center of the tuna was well done, but it wasn't at all dry. Â I absolutely loved it. Â This tuna really taught me that you can cook fish, it just has to be done the right way.I liked my dish, but I loved the dish my boyfriend ordered. Â The lamb was tender, the rice was beautifully seasoned, just the slightest bit oily with the fat from the lamb, and browned. Â The texture was lovely, a bit sticky and starchy on the outsides of the rice, but still firm.I had never tasted food like this before. Â It was fantastic. Â I was blown away while eating my meal, I couldn't stop commenting on how good the food was. Â Through mouthfuls of ginger drink and frites I blabbed on and on and on about how much I loved what I was eating... a bit like what I'm doing right now."

I got the poisson grille, a riz gras and the poulet braise for my boyfriend.My fingers were covered in oil and spices and deliciousness when I got home. The fish was well seasoned and the tomato onion topping (with some additional lemon from my fridge) cut the richness quite well.I'm in love with the riz gras and he liked the grilled chicken.You get SO much food for such a little bit and they're so accommodating.

431,EXtAG3Yi3vfRHA0XWyKlyA,12/28/2014,5 star rating,"Some of the people who gave this place bad reviews clearly do not know any West Africans, or have not had an authentic experience eating their food and being in their cultural spaces. To the guy who expected to be served as he sat down, said the food was impossible to eat without using your hands, and didn't know what to do with the magi cube... Really? If you want an American experience, GO TO AN AMERICAN RESTAURANT!!!That said, I went with three Malians who had previously shown me the proper way to dine. You approach the counter and let them know if you're ordering for there or taking out. They don't approach you first, especially if you don't even speak their language (French or a local African dialect). We opted to eat there. I let them order, which was Â 2 huge helpings of attieke, chicken, and a fish. The food was authentic, delicious!! Flavorful (BTW, crush the magi cube and sprinkle it over the attieke) and yes, a little messy (Malians eat with their hands in their country). The atmosphere (west African men filled the place) would be weird for outsiders, but again, going with someone from the culture helps. The price was reasonable. We paid about $45 to feed four of us. For those saying it is pricey, my guys got a good deal as ordering for a group and sharing is the best way to get to most value out of your meal. Remember, African culture is communal.To be honest, I love that they cater to folks from their culture and could care less about the random person who only wants to come in and judge but not learn. It's hard to maintain authenticity in a space where another culture (American) is dominant and expects everyone else to conform."

Only those who reserved spots were there enjoying drinks hookah and music. We wanted to sit but we found out that only if you reserve can you sit and reservations require a bottle that costs around $120. We thought that was a bit odd. So instead we had to drink and have hookah at the bar which wasn't terrible but very awkward. Boyfriend and I ordered a drink each, came out to 25 roughly...we wanted to pay by card and there was a $30 minimum so we opened a tab. Hookah was about $35/40 so we payed $7 each. Hookah was great. The music was awesome and some of the drinks were great. The shots of tequila were $11 each.Overall the crowd was cool, the music was great and the hookah good too! I would go back, I just wasn't so happy with the quality of my drink or how expensive it was. Also no one tipped the bartender except my group. He was a great person to be around and he made the drinks I ordered great as the night went on. Remember to tip them guys!"

That's exactly what my friends and I experienced until we got here.For a party of 4 around 9pm on a Friday night, we were able to walk in and waited no more than 5 minutes for a table. We tried the ""Paid Time Off"" and ""Savage Detective"" both of which were really good. My friend thought the ""Savage Detective"" which has IPA and mezcal in it was a bit on the strong side but I loved that the lemon and honey gave the drink a bit of sweet, savoury without neglecting the taste of the alcohol. That's a good drink to me.Pricing is parallel to standard NYC speakeasy pricing so you should expect to pay $14 before tips per drink but I think it's worth it for the experience and ambiance.

The waiter was terrible, he could not answer any questions either about the wine or the food. Ok, fine, must be new, we thought. The food came, without any sauces or/and condiments. Again, the waiter had no idea what else should be brought out. Fine, still new guy, we thought. Time for the check. The waiter is no where to be found. We asked someone else for the check. Check comes in - double as expected. Why? Because he not only charged us for a glass of wine, but also added a bottle of wine to the check. Again, looking for him to take care of it. After a while he shows up and just drops the updated check on the table, not a word about mishap. Check looks fine, but there is no pen to sign it with. Waiter is gone again. After yet another 10 min we are looking for a manager to speak to. Manager comes in, we explain the situation and his reaction is ""well, it's not my fault, I was not aware of any of this"". There is no understanding that it's his restaurant and his staff. He produces a pen so we can just pay for the food.

The customer service is above average, and the food for the most part is above average (for an Israeli place, the food is still above average, and the customer service is out of the world). This place is very conducive to bringing a large group. Reasonable prices, and many positive overall experiences.It's EXTREMELY important to realize that even when making a reservation, you're gonna have to wait --sometimes up to 30min standing in the cramped hallway. Also, avoid their combination platter (appetizer) for $13 ... a prime example of highway robbery: maybe 3 spoonfuls of each appetizer (total 15 spoonfuls). Thinking about it now, I would recommend avoiding MANY dishes, mainly due to RIPOFF pricing!! $10 for the ""fruit platter"" that consists of 5 kiwis, a slice of pineapple, and a dribble of red sauce is a real disgrace!! Tiramisu for $9 isn't nearly as bad, but it's still a ripoff considering that it's perfectly average tiramisu. I must say that their beef kebab (not ground) is an excellent dish-- not only very well balanced, but a relatively light meal. In my reviews I often pay tribute to Mark, a very well known chef in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn. Anyone who has tried his cooking, writes dazzling reviews, that not only compliment his elite skills in the kitchen, but also discuss his exquisite and rare herbal combinations that ultimately produce a dish so far out of this world. Anyways, I came here for Mark's birthday (due to the later hours), and decided to order him something that he wouldn't call a disappointment: the extra large 22oz house steak (rare). Because of his status, many wanted to observe his reaction to this particular dish. Mark loved it, and called it the best steak that he's ever had ,,, quite a statement !!!! The waiters were relieved to hear that Mark enjoyed it.I was eager to try the tuna tartar from here, but unfortunately they lather spicy mayonnaise on top!!! Unacceptable!!! We happened to have a very fine waiter that evening, so without any hassle, he returned one of the tuna tartars that we ordered. Mark thought it was OK.On a side note, I always recommend the schnitzel from this place --they do a very good job with it. Although it's not the waiter's fault, when dealing with a party of 4+, they should have the option to just leave the water on the table. I can't describe how inefficient it is, for them to refill each glass, and not leave one of the metal water pitchers on the table. It seems to me that they're pretty attached to those metal pitchers ,,,Note: The first time I came here, I accidentally tipped less than the ""standard"" (simple calculator error). Our server was not impressed and 'demanded' a higher tip. In hindsight, I should have given him a tip of 0% after his tantrum. There are ways to say the same thing without being nasty. Tips are earned, not always given.4.445/5.000"

However, I've noticed that the counter person never gives correct change always keeping 2, 3 or 4 cents. The first time My bill was $7.03 one day and I gave him $10.10 and he said thanks handed me 3 dollars an closed the register. Being in a rush I thought the heck with it and left. The second time I called him out on the two cents he tried to keep and his response was ""it's only 2 cents but your right""Yesterday the same thin. How much is he making by only STEALING ""2cents"" a customer?Sorry no more!"

I would stick with beer here - cocktails weren't great. There's a few booths and pool table in the back - great for a chill night!"

They have cheap drafts and a pbr and whiskey combo for $5 or $6 depending on the night. They have a small billiards table and a video game console."
485,oUVX94JtKyLPXozC2hemCg,10/14/2014,5 star rating,"This bar is in a convenient location and it is wedged right in between Death & Co and Amor & Amargo. This is a dive bar, so be forewarned. You won't get a sexy interior or mixologists with handle bar moustaches to tell you about all the different bitters. But you will have a good time and this is why. Of course, my hottie date is late, this has been the pattern for awhile, but given the specimen, well worth the wait. I walk into the bar, scanned it out and decided to sit at the bar. The bar had a few people, but it wasn't packed. Two people ordered up 2 bottles of Amstel Light and tried to pay with a credit card. Bar maid declined the card, this is a CASH ONLY establishment. They walked out saying they would come back, but she didn't believed them and offered me their beers for FREE. Now, on the one hand, Amstel light is usually a deal breaker, Â but on the other hand, it was FREE. So I politely accepted, took a few gulps and checked out the draft list. Everything here is incredibly cheap, no beer over $7, which is great! And of course while you wait for a date, interesting things happen. For one, two girls to my left clearly were on a date and one started talking to me. A striking beautiful blonde she was. We chit chatted a bit, talked about JoanJett and the good jukebox music in the bar, offered up definitions for SNAFU and FUBAR, and before you know, it, she bought me a fireball shot. So for the half hour I waited for my date, I was offered 3 FREE drinks. Not bad at all if you ask me. And guess what? Those two people that ordered up the Amstel light came back! They got another round of beers, made out profusely and quickly left the bar...Ahem. Thirty minutes passed, the hottie walked through the door, mesmerized myself and the hot blonde and the drinking ensued. Not bad for a Tuesday school night."
486,oUVX94JtKyLPXozC2hemCg,6/24/2018,3 star rating,This place breaks my heart. I really like it but honestly the bartender and bouncer have some sort of deep emotional problem and hate anybody who is having fun at their bar. Plenty of other dive bars to go to if you want to have a good time minus douche bags. The bouncer has no problem touching women so take that as you will.On the plus this side made for a great podcast episode. Check out my podcast Asian not Asian podcast on iTunesHave fun and stay safe

It's definitely not like the other bars on the street but if you want a cool place with a homey feel, good drinks, maybe a quick round of pool, and some good conversation I would go here. The drinks are fair priced. I got a couple rounds of Mojitos and they were great. The place is small but once again if you just want to find a nice place to chill with your friends, go here. Also, they have available outlets (god bless!) my phone was practically dead. Loved this place and I'll be back again."

You can't take photos of strangers.""Friend: ""the people I took a photo of are our friends.""Bartender: ""you can't take photos of strangers. You know what? Get the fuck out. Leave your drinks and get the fuck out of here.""No attempt is made by the bartender to come to terms about this being a misunderstanding. He cuts hard to using insulting language to tell us to leave.Friend and I leave in a state of confusion, and wait outside the bar for our other friends to join us. A moment later, the bartender appears on the doorstep and starts taunting us. We again try to explain to him that the photo was taken of our friends. For some reason he refuses to accept this, and keeps telling us to get the fuck out, even though at this point we are standing on the sidewalk, waiting for our remaining friends to come out of the bar so we can leave as a group.Our friends finally come outside, unaware of why we left the bar. At this point, the bartender is still taunting my friend. Words are exchanged between my group of friends and the bar staff; a stand-off has formed outside. Then, in a pathetic attempt at showing force, the bartender shoves one of the female members of our group.Don't give this bar your business. It's run by degenerates."

Really not sure why he singled out someone just to bully. Also he pushed a woman.Sad, it was one of our favorite dive bars."

We landed on a bar that was so packed we couldn't even walk in the door, so we did a bit of walking and that's how we ended up at Cherry Tavern. This place is certainly for an older crowd of regulars. My friends and I walked in wearing our Saturday night goin out clothes and were greeted by groups of casual thirty somethings just there to grab a beer with friends. (Totallynot a bad thing, but I guess if you're looking to find yourself a hot dude to buy you a fancy drink, head elsewhere.) Drinks here are cheap! I believe we came at a happyhour time, and all wells drinks were $5 or $6, depending on which bartender was helping you (not sure why the price varied). The bartenders are young, quick, and friendly, and they acted weirdly surprised when we gave them tips - are there sad people out there who really don't tip their bartenders?? Also, note that this bar is CASH ONLY!! They do have an ATM though, so no need to worry if you buy one too many drinks and run out of Hamiltons."

First, there's a pool table. If a bar has a pool table they atomically become a good bar. All the drinks are very cheap and they have great specials too. The downside is that it's cash only so be prepared! They have a juke box although it already comes with their own set of CD's so you can't really choose anything you want. The place isn't usually crazy crowded too so I usually like to come here because getting a game of pool isn't pulling teeth! The bartenders are also very nice. The bathroom is super dive bar though so, beware!"

I get that they're busy so it's understandable, HOWEVER they have messed up my order way too many times. I don't know how hard it is to get a basic breakfast sandwich right. I'm sick of having to come back only to wait another 20 min for them to fix what they did wrong. This deli is close and convenient but it's just not worth the hassle anymore. On top of that, they raised their prices. Why was I charged $20 for 2 BEC's, a small orange juice and small coffee? Idk who they think they are. Not worth your time or your money."

Â She did it early anticipating that they might have a busy lunch, so we received our food before noon. Â I ordered a Greek Salad without olives and quickly put mine in the fridge after it arrived.An hour later when I had a chance to take a lunch, I found that the salad smelled a bit when I opened the container & a lot of the lettuce was quite wilty. Â The olives had initially been in it and removed (not a big deal as it is a pre-packaged salad), but the lettuce underneath where they had been was pretty wet as a result. Â Unfortunately, the cucumbers were very slimy and stuck together and the red onions dried out.Upon looking closer, I saw the ""packaged on"" date of three days ago. Â Probably not a good idea to sell a salad that is three days old.I called my coworker & asked her to call C&C letting them know that the salad was past date & to see if we could have a credit on the books. Â I don't need my money back today. Â Nor do I need a replacement salad -- for fear that others are just as old. Â Unfortunately the person she spoke with didn't seem to care. Â His response was something along the lines of, ""You ordered over an hour & a half ago and are JUST NOW calling to complain? Â I don't know what you want me to do.""""I realize that but I ordered for my office & cannot control when someone chooses to eat their lunch and notice that their food is past date.""""I just don't know what you want me to do.""After that, my coworker didn't bother asking for anything but told him that it was more of a head's up call in case they get others saying they have past date salads, etc.We've never had an issue with C&C; have ordered from them often and have enjoyed their food until today. Â Unfortunately given this experience, they not only lost me as a customer, but the rest of my 15+ person office as well."

The fries on their own were fine but any that had cheese were soggy. Stick with the regular fries and you'll be fine.The bathroom. Dear God, the bathroom. First off all, when I walked in it literally smelled like shit. Second, it was a filthy mess. Third, just as I was about to hover I realized there was no TP.

She told me that they didn't have sprite so I called my fat wife and told her (I sure got an earful that day). Then when she gave me my food she forgot the burgers and only gave me fries and when I mentioned this to her she said that she would be right back with it but instead she walked from behind the counter and licked my shoulder. PLEASE HELP I MAY HAVE HERPES. A man brought me my burgers. I went home and opened the fries to chow down. My fat wife was sitting next to me drinking the diet Dr. Pepper that I got her (she really needs to go on a diet). When I looked in the fry container, there was no chili nor was there any cheese. The fries were frozen and clumped together and there was dish soap under them. I was disappointed about the food but more disappointed that I still had to deal with my fat wife."

Â It is as many have described it to be and that's ""another burger and fries"" joint but in observing the menu there seem to be some pretty cool choices. Â I went with a safe bet of a spicy chicken sandwich value meal since that gave you the spicy fries and a drink. Â I doused the chicken patty with the hot sauce they have on hand as I didn't find it to be as spicy as I would have liked. Â The fries were tasty enough but I had to say that the one major gripe was the actual size of the sandwich. Â It was very, very small and can be compared to the size of the $1 chicken sandwich one gets at McDonald's or Wendy's. Â The container of fries was also rather small and that was just no good. Â It tasted good enough but had I known the size I would have gotten something else on the menu. Â I admit that the Philly cheese steak burger seemed interesting as did their chili cheeseburgers and boneless hot wings. Â I guess the next time I am in the area I will give one or both of those a try. Â Of course I recommend some serious walking to not have the calories cause you harm after this stuff. Â Visually and comfort wise this was OK. Â The restaurant looked clean and the staff served the customers with smiles. Â Never a bad thing."

When i asked the girl at the register about any specials she just pointed to the board and said that's it and made a face. I looked at her as if she was crazy because i didn't understand the attitude and the lack of service she displayed. The previous customer in front of me thought it was funny how she handled the situation and the employee coughed and proceeded to say listen ""im sick"" coughing in her hand. I walked away and said never mind and as i was leaving she responded ""good i don't care bye"" she continued to be disrespectful and this is when i turned back around and asked her what did she say and eventually had to curse her out for being so disrespectful to me just because i asked her a question about HER JOB'S MENU. I work in customer service and I am very aware how to talk to people and display proper customer service and in this situation that wasn't it.

I ended up getting boneless and mixed lemon pepper and teriyaki. The lemon pepper were delicious and was a dry rub while the teriyaki was very saucy. I did not care for teriyaki flavor. It was very salty and turned me off a bit. But I really did enjoy the lemon pepper and recommend them. The soda machine has LOTS of options. As I've been staying away from soda, this is the only place I know that sells Cherry Vanilla Dr Pepper. Price wise, getting a meal is reasonable.

Before they closed due to a crumbling foundation in their building, it was a horrible place to eat. Now its even worse. The quesadilla chicken comes from their chicken soup, strained, and then placed in the quesadilla. It ends up being a soggy, wet bunch of dough in your tin container. An umhappy customer came in to xomplain about their order and the middle eastern man at the register (the owner) told him to, ajd I quote:""Shut the f*** up you fa***t. ""Accompanied by more slurs. His employee then came aroun nd the counter with a broom and threatened Â the customer, telling him to leave and he wont he getting a refund. My wife and I completely lost our appetite and left, leaving everything on the table. This place needs to close. This same location, 2 establishments ago was called ""Burrito Loco."" How I miss it so"

Pros: huge portions and a lot of veggies!Cons: the tacos are constructed like a burrito with rice and beans inside of it. This makes the taco quite heavy. The meat was very bland. Overall the tacos were good for 1am on a Thursday. Would I recommend this place? Probably not, but good to have as a super late night option."
532,zEHzdRjEa23tcH585_SqHw,1/17/2016,5 star rating,"A classic Bushwick establishment and my go-to for delicious Mexican and Middle Eastern favorites. They have an extensive vegan menu which includes a variety of burritos, quesadillas, nachos, salads, tacos, and more. Their faux chicken is some of the best I've tasted. Made in house, the flavor and texture is perfect, and I recommend it to veggies and omnivores alike.I love everything here, but my top favorites are:-Vegan chicken quesadilla-Vegan beef nachos -Falafel burrito -FriesDelivery is extremely fast and always so friendly. The restaurant itself is divey but charming. Great selection of Jarritos. Go here-you will NOT be disappointed."
533,pTv4RDll3N_CGG3BwtEctg,11/17/2021,1 star rating,"[Please forward to the attention of Mr. Philippe Delgrange]Dear Mr. Delgrange, I hope you are well this week, and please understand that it is quite rare for me to connect with a business owner under these circumstances.I am the Executive Assistant to a high level executive with a luxury beauty brand in Midtown, and before the pandemic, regularly patronized Cafe Bilboquet (3x per week or more) for lunch. He is always so pleased with the lunch options there, and is delighted whenever I order for him. Today he had a working lunch, and of course requested his favorite! I placed the order for an 11:45 am pickup on the SEAMLESS App around 9:00 am. When I arrived at Cafe Bilboquet, I found that the soups had been removed from my order. The person behind the counter was very aggravated when I tried to show her that I had in fact ordered soups. I pulled out my phone and showed her. Sure enough - the soups had been removed from my order by the restaurant, which was evident on the app. The person behind the counter called over another server who confirmed that she had removed the soups from my order. When I asked her why, her response was: ""Because you placed the order at 9:00 am and I didn't know if we would have soup at that point."" This to me was unbelievable. Since I did see that there was a mushroom soup available, I asked if I could have the soups at that point. I was told that I would need to pay for them separately. Since I had placed the order on Seamless with my executive's card (which was not in my possession) I did not have any form of payment on me. This is when it became DISTURBING versus inconvenient: The manager came to me with a horrible attitude and told me she was not letting me leave with soup unless I paid. I explained to her that it was the cafe's mistake and that I did not have a form of payment on me. Any normal restaurant manager would take the loss of two soups to keep a very regular customer. This was unfortunately not the case. I even offered to call after getting back to my office to pay over the phone. She deemed this unallowable. I understand that some managers - especially the greener managers - need for all things to be above board. What I could not understand was her deplorable attitude. I was not holding up a line or being unreasonable - I only wanted my boss - who is a very very regular customer, to have soup with his salad. It was a very simple request, and one I delivered with zero attitude or intolerance. I was in the service industry for 5 years. I have been an assistant for over a decade. I have never treated or been treated the way that I was in your establishment today. The manager should be pulled aside and educated on customer service. It honestly makes me nervous for her direct reports that she could be so incredibly rude, uncouth, unprofessional, and frankly - disgusting. I am so put off by this event, that I do plan to mention to my executive. I would hope that you address this issue with your manager directly - or at least the person that she reports to if it is not you. Many thanks for taking the time to read this note, and be well!Katharine Johnson"
534,pTv4RDll3N_CGG3BwtEctg,12/29/2022,4 star rating,"One of our favorite french and patisserie cafe in New York City. It is located literally one black away from the Central Park. We came there for lunch with the whole family and got a few dishes to share: quinoa salads, cheese and spinach quiche, mushroom quiche, a few croissants and cookies. Everything was delicious. Latte and cappuccino were great too but not very hot, and unfortunately they only had to-go cups. The place is not very big and it is narrow. It was hard to find a table because it was packed - we had to wait a few minutes. Since it was very cold out nobody was using outside tables. They mixed our order a little bit (forgot a few items, but maybe because it was a large order - not sure). Also it is self service: you clean your table and you bring everything to your table too. There is only one bathroom and wasn't very clean - again maybe because it was packed and they didn't have time to refresh it )))"

I stopped in for the lavender and the birthday cake and both had their character. I also like the atmosphere, in addition to the interior design they have cute French themed work uniforms. FYI, there is a sign at the register saying that they don't allow personal computers in the restaurant, which feels refreshing to me."

Â The baguette is also crisp and moist inside. Â One of my favorites in the city.The macaron is crisp outside and soft. Â Today I tried foie gras macaron and a lemon one. Â Both were outstanding!

There are some prices written on a chalk board by the cashier but these do not necessarily correspond to the selections in the case for the day, Â many are simply not stated; expect to spend some money everything is premium priced.Today, ask for something heated - this takes a few minutes; but the counter service person I ordered it from doesn't remember me when it's ready so it goes to the cashier who has no idea who its for (I've paid for my selections at this point). In the while, my food is given by the cashier to another customer who inspects it and gives it back to the cashier. Then the cashier calls out in a loud voice the the name of the item. I went over to collect my barely warm quiche in a small box but I was too angry and humiliated to say anything I was thinking which I'd regret. I left, I was so embarrassed and ashamed that I'd spent +$17 on something I could not eat, threw in the garbage after I left. Never again."

The quiche, although it was ""heated"" on what looked to be a panini press, it was still cold on the bottom. I reheated once I got home. Was still tasty. Hand sanitizer is available at the door upon entry and they have a few small tables so you can eat in doors. I will be back for more pastries."

545,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,10/1/2019,1 star rating,"I really wanted to like this place. Tiny, tiny place with a sweet vibe. So it's just an espresso shop with a few pastries, not a place where you could get a breakfast, lunch, etc. But if it's an espresso shop, then the espresso had better be good. I am surprised at how many people give very positive reviews. My latte had no flavor whatsoever, and certainly no coffee aroma. I have to presume they're using some very light roast coffee beans. Well, if this kind of flavor is what you want, you can get a $1 coffee at a gas station. But a 16 oz latte here costs $5.65. Ouch. For something that gives no pleasure in drinking, that is a very serious tariff! Even one block away, Ozzie's will give you a mild, undistinguished latte that does not cost anything close to $5.65. So I see no reason to go to Buunni whatsoever.Dear owners: If you're going to charge a top price, you need to serve espresso with a noteworthy flavor and aroma!"

I ordered a Ethiopian Macchiato that was not a typical Macchiato you would get at a mainstream coffee place. Â Mine was a 6 ounce drink that was lightly sweetened with a robust coffee flavor. Â I also ordered a chocolate walnut scone that tasted more like a cookie but even still it was delicious.

It was nice and quiet when we went (1pm on a Friday) but soon filled up with joggers and the like who were stopping in. There IS a nice nook to sit, but will probably feel a little cramped if there is anyone else camping out there. The coffee is super good though, and their scones serve to complement the flavor of their beans."

The inside is small with bohemian decor and a good vibe. The staff are pretty chill. There is one communal table and time limited WiFi so it is a place to stop in rather than to hang out and work. Pinehurst Street is tree-lined and really nice to walk along to admire the quintessential New York architecture. There is also a park nearby so there are plenty of other places to enjoy your beverage if seating is full.I ordered an almond milk latte and a spinach and cheese croissant type pastry. They offered to heat it up. My friends got drip coffee and scones. I was really pleased with both my pastry and my latte, and my friends enjoyed theirs. This is the place I bring people to for morning coffee if they are staying with me in New York. It is definitely popular with locals and I wish there were more cafes like this in the neighborhood."

The food is delicious and a great option if you want to dip your toes into Malaysian food.Tok Tok Mee (4.5/5): I've never been impressed with the texture of egg noodles until now. They are just somehow this amazing chewy texture and the savory dark soy sauce coating the bottom of the bowl was incredible. Honestly, the fried pork wontons didn't really impress me as they felt under fried and were oddly soft and chewy at the same time. However, I liked the rest of the dish so much, I honestly didn't even care that much.Chilled Spicy Sesame Noodles (4.25/5): This was much more watery than I was expecting, but still very delicious. The rice noodles they use are such an interesting texture: simultaneously slippery and extremely bouncy. Kind of reminded me of liang pi, but the noodles have a funner mouthfeel.Teh Tarik (4.25/5): Reading the description, I was concerned that this would be overly sweet, but it definitely was not.

572,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,11/13/2022,3 star rating,"I had high expectations for this place, given all the glowing Yelp reviews. But the only dish that stood out to me was the tok tok mee. The fried egg noodles were flavorful - mixed in the house dark sauce with pork lard. I also ordered the Nasi Lemak - it was everything the menu described but not exactly how I remembered it from Malaysia. White coffee - another specialty of Kopitiam. It was just coffee overloaded with condensed milk - I had to add more hot water to it to dilute the overpowering sweetness.The dessert was notable - milky rose lychee mochi. I'd recommend this place if you are around the area for a quick bite. But if you are looking for a more authentic Malaysian place, try Wok Wok."

The hot honey chicken sandwich was warm, but look how little sauce they put on it. It's supposed to drenched and dripping in the hot honey. Y'all pray for me because I couldn't even finish that meal. They did add more sauce for me, but the meal was ruined for me. I won't be back."

576,idha1p-gDIbkNFF-PfWmEA,2/14/2021,3 star rating,"I've been seeing a lot of pictures of chicken sandwiches on my Instagram feed for some reason and this place kept popping up. The pictures looked amazing and chicken looked huge. After seeing that, I knew I had to try it and I opted for the Fire Bird sandwich. This sandwich comes with a toasted bun, pickles, pickled peppers, chipotle mayo, and crispy chicken. I also got a side of wasabi honey. Once I ordered, I waited in excitement to get this sandwich that I have been seeing all over IG. However, when I got it, it was small compared to pictures I've seen and it wasn't really crunchy. Yes, it was juicy. Definitely add the honey because it adds a nice sweetness to the sandwich. But for the price of $11.75, I did expect something better. If I were to compare this to the Popeye's chicken sandwich, Popeyes would win by a land slide and it would be half the cost."

Admittedly the details are hazy, but the classic chicken sandwich was fine. Nothing memorable or crazy delicious. I asked for sauce, and I got packets of Cholula. I dunno.... I guess I was expecting a bit more."
578,idha1p-gDIbkNFF-PfWmEA,3/1/2022,4 star rating,Great chicken and fries! Takes awhile to come out though even if there are only you and someone else there but it's fresh so it makes sense. Their chicken has gotten small the past few years but they give a bit more fries to make up for it so that helps it and the fountain Boylan is always a great choice!

The quality and seasoning has stayed the same during COVID and packaging is great.We pre ordered on Seamless and opted for a combo of two dark meat + fries + Cole slaw, as well as two separate pieces of a chicken wing and drumstick. They did give us the correct sauces and the request for the dark meat to be thighs.The chicken was legitimately seasoned so well and was so crispy. Ugh. I am wanting some more right now as I write this review. Skip your cravings for Popeyes and get some life changing Blue Ribbon!"

Williamsburg Thai is conveniently located on Bedford Avenue, close to the L train station in the area. We were in the mood for some standard Thai dishes and since neither of us had been here before we decided to give it a try. When it came time to order we decided to go with the fresh summer rolls for our appetizer. For my main I went with a classic, pad see ew. Both of these dishes were well prepared and hit the mark, but then again, it be almost hard for any Thai restaurant to mess up these staple dishes. The service here was also really good. Our waiter was super friendly and they brought out our dishes shortly after we ordered them. If you're in Williamsburg - more towards Bedford Avenue, I'd totally suggest trying this spot out if you're in the mood for standard Thai dishes that won't disappoint."

Going in, the staff was pretty nice to me and they worked very fast - they prepared my order in under 10 minutes.Pad Thai w/ Beef and Pork ($16) - Honestly a pretty average priced meal with a pretty decent flavor. They definitely gave enough noodles to make me full for the whole afternoon so I was happy with that. The Pad Thai also included bean sprouts, lime, and crushed peanuts, which I deem essential to a good Pad Thai. I enjoyed the perfect cook on the noodles and meat, although I wish they gave a bit more. However, it was still a decent amount of meat so I have no real complaints. Overall, a solid dish.This restaurant is pretty solid. It has pretty good service, and the food is solid. Not the best Thai food ever, but I have no complaints about it. I'd come again if I was in the area."

The drunken noodles are so good. Flat and chewy but still long strands of noodles. Popping with flavor. We also ordered a veggie seafood dish served with jasmine rice on the side. Totally recommend all these dishes and wash it down with a Sapporo beer of beer lao! Hopefully they get some space heaters for fall/ winter but I would be back and also order to go.

I especially like the tiny window for payment, it looks like a cut out of a card slot in the giant plastic they erected. When the food is ready, its delivered to the take out door on a table. The door closes, you open the second door and retrieve your order. That Â 2 way door system shows ingenuity.I got the pad see ew and my friend had the massaman curry.

Â Limited staff but zero communication on how long it would take to get food. Each order took 30min to an HOUR. Â  A charcuterie board does not take 30 min to make at 6pm! People walked out because of the wait for food Â and the number of times we were told it's coming soon was ludicrous. Â Nothing was done to appease the group and we spent over way too much money for a terrible experience.The waiter said there were 2 trainees working on a Friday night. Â TO THE OWNER/MANAGER: Â why are trainees working on a weekend night?!! Where was any manager overseeing what was going on? Â If you're trying to expand to multiple locations maybe make sure the quality doesn't go downhill at your original location first. Â I'll try this place again next month but not a great sign of things to come if this is the business model.

They had tons of selection of pizza slices on a Wednesday at 10:00pm. Staff were really friendly here. That stood out. The pizza is pricy but good. The sausage and pepperoni super thin crust slice for $5.25 was delicious with great tasting pepperoni and sausage but the end of the crust was a bit too crunchy. The spicy pepperoni square thick slice for $4.75 had tons of pepperoni, but too strong of a garlic taste really ruined it for me."

Of course the spicy pepperoni sicilian squares are delicious: the pepperoni cups crispy and greasy, the thick doughy crust serving as the ideal base to soak up the sauce and cheese. Sodium through the roof, but you only live once. The circular pies are also hard to beat. Those ovens get such a great texture on the crust, the perfect firmness, with a snappy chew that works well with any topping combo. Last night, I got a margherita pizza for the first time here, and it damn near blew my mind. So good. The prices are what you'd expect for pizza of this caliber. Way way better than your average Little Italy or Famous Amadeus slice, and a great example of real New York pizza."

The prices weren't so expensive, but the dough, the sauce were so good compared to pizza in CA. We like the in crust but quite crispy. The garlic balls were inexpensive and everyone in the family liked them.We like to go there and sampled all these different style pizza in slices. We couldn't stop trying them all.

638,HzmjJ1mM0WdOHbfYm5mxqw,12/13/2021,4 star rating,Great pizza! Nice flavors and crispy crust!However.. I would recommend coming about three hours before closing because if not you're choices of toppings will probably be limited.We've gone twice so far and both times we weren't able to get exactly what we wanted (hence the four stars.)Pepperoni is one of the most popular toppings so I would expect a pizza place to serve it all day and night but that wasn't the case when we came 40 minutes before closing the second night.The first night we were able to get pepperoni slices but I couldn't get the Sicilian pepperoni slice I so craved! And we had came about 2 hours before that night.If not for this I would give five stars for sure because the pizza was good but you gotta give the people what they want!! **cough cough pepperonis please**Service was good enough and seating was fair. Of course to dine in in NYC now you have to show vaccination cards. We had ours but still decided to sit outside.

Traveling for a day trip to NYC while visiting out of state, my husband and kids wanted traditional NYC pizza. They were not disappointed. There's nothing like this where we live. While my husband grew up experiencing this type of pizza, our kids haven't and frequently dine on mediocre middle US pizza. They were pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste of Carnegie Pizza. While my husband preferred to deep dish Sicilian style pizza, the kids enjoyed the thinner NYC style slices. Since I have food allergies, I didn't try the pizza--although I was very tempted by the aroma of the margarita pizza. Thanks for topping off our day trip in NYC!"

This is mostly a takeout place, however they have a handful of tables in the back - seating / tables are limited. Carnegie had such a big variety of slice options including a few different kinds of Sicilian styles as well! The garlic knots were so pillowy, buttery and soft with lots of garlic. We tried a standard pepperoni & mushroom slice and the pepperoni Sicilian style pizza. Beware - if ordering a whole Sicilian, this pie is huge! The sauce is packed with flavor and lots of garlic (perfect for garlic lovers). Quality toppings. Friendly & quick service. Definitely worth a stop for a delicious slice & some knots."

If you're getting a specialty drink, or hot sandwich in the morning expect to wait 5-10 mins. The hot sandwiches are toasted well and taste great! Drinks are consistent. The manager is friendly and considerate of the customers. They play hip hop, R&B, and top hits and the workers enjoy singing along. There's a good amount of seating, plugs, and people come and go, so it doesn't get too crowded unless it's raining and people don't have umbrellas. Two downsides are their restroom stinks like death, and usually is out of toilet paper, so bring your own TP. Big flies fly around everywhere especially the 2nd floor seating area. Overall, this Starbucks is consistent, and in a great location."

The flavors of cold sesame noodle dish, I can close my eyes and still taste it. I learned how to make these noodles however nothing will ever compare.

668,oZIo2MOmnd_CML1F11N3Vg,8/2/2022,4 star rating,"New York City has no shortage of amazing ramen restaurants, and Ivan Ramen is no exception. Every dish is absolutely gorgeous, and the flavors definitely live up to the Instagram-worthy presentation. For my plant-based friends, they have an absolutely amazing vegan shoyu ramen, or you can always go for one of their vegetarian starters. I'm, personally, a huge fan of crispy eggplant, which has a delightful breadcrumb layer that is fried to golden perfection and offers the best contrast against the soft, succulent eggplant. This goes beautifully with the rich, nutty sesame paste and the smoky, fragrant charred garlic. If you're a fan of eggplant, I definitely recommend giving this dish a shot...and, honestly, I'd still give it a try if you aren't a huge fan of eggplant -- this dish might be the one to convert you! They also have a lovely yuzu cheesecake with a burnt top; while the cake was rich and lovely, I didn't find it particularly special. The yuzu flavor wasn't particularly strong, and it honestly just tasted like a slightly lemon-y, vanilla-y New York slice. The burnt topping was a nice contrast, but I think that there was a bit too much of it for my taste. All in all, though, I loved my experience at Ivan Ramen. The service was phenomenal, the prices were reasonable, and the outdoor patio was wonderful. I can't wait to visit again!"
669,oZIo2MOmnd_CML1F11N3Vg,3/15/2023,4 star rating,"Came here for lunch, no reservation, was seated immediately. Host was very kind although I did not get her name, we decided to get the Japanese fried chicken , crispy Eggplant, and the Chicken Paitan ramen. Crispy Eggplant: really enjoyed this! Texture was on point, very crispy on the outside, inside was nice and soft. It comes plated on a sesame sauce, which paired nicely. Overall a pretty mild flavored dish, but done well.Japanese fried chicken: unfortunately I didn't like this as much as I was expecting to. Unlike a traditional Karaage, it has a wet garlic caramel sauce on it and comes w a shisho ranch sauce on the side. We ended up sending this dish back because it was too acidic for us, I felt the wet sauce took away from it. They very kindly comped it off our bill which was greatly appreciated. That being said the shisho ranch sauce was really good! Just wish I liked the actual chicken more. Chicken Paitan Ramen: enjoyed this! Comes w a soft egg yolk on top that you mix into the broth and ground chicken. Pretty light but flavorful, pretty heavy on the black pepper so if you don't like that, I'd get another dish, but I enjoyed the peppery flavor. Noodles were thin and cooked well.Also want to note service was very good and fast here! Shoutout to our server Aimee, she was very kind and helpful. Ambience was nice as well."

We ordered the steamed pork buns, brussel sprouts, chicken paitan, and tonkotsu ramen. It was good, super quick (like most ramen spots) but the broth for both ramens was not as flavorful or didn't have as much depth as Ippudo. If you don't want to wait for Ippudo and you're downtown and you can snag a reservation at Ivan, it's a decent alternative."

It came with a garlic aoili mixed with herbs and the balance between the two made it one of the best things I've eaten. For ramen, I got the pork ramen and the broth had a depth of flavor that was unmatched. The umami and creaminess of the broth mixed with all of the toppings made me eat every last drop.

Â Thus, during my 5-year experience in this branch, no matter how badly they fxxked my order, I was always patient and satisfied. Â But what happened on Jul 15 was unacceptable and way beyond my tolerance. Â On Jul 15, I wanted a bucket with 8 pc chicken for my lunch with my wife. Â I drove to there and tried to make my order. Â Here is the conversation:Me: Â Could I have the 8 pc bucket and could I have all grilled chicken?Lady 1: Â Sir, we serve original, crispy, and grilled. Â What do you want?Me: Â Ok, could I have all grilled then?Lady 1: Â Sir, original, crispy, and grilled. Â What do you want?Me: Â All grilled chicken please.Lady 1: (she became very annoyed and impatient) Â Sir! Â You are not LISTENING to me. Â We serve original, crispy, and grilled. Â You HAVE TO make a choice!""Me: Â Yea, my choice is all grilled chicken. Â Are you saying I couldn't have all grilled chicken?Lady 1: Â Let me ask.Then she turned to Lady 2 and asked if I could order all grilled chicken in that bucket. Â Lady 2 said ""Yes"". Â Then Lady 1 returned with still an annoyed tone.Lady 1: Â Sir. Â How do you like your chicken?Me: Â Could I have 2 breasts and 6 legs?Lady 1 turned to Lady 2: Â Could you check if we have 6 grilled legs?Lady 2 was checking her cellphone and didn't respond. Â Lady 1 turned her head back and clearly, was expecting a reply from Lady 2.Here came the deadly 10 second silence. Â Then I made a move.Me: Â Could you just please check if I could order 6 pc grilled chicken legs or not?Lady 1 gave me a sigh and went check by herself. Â Lady 2 was stilling looking at her cellphone. Â Was she playing Pokemon Go? Â Otherwise how could she act so unprofessionally? Â Lady 1 returned after a few seconds then said:Sir, we do not have 6 grilled legs. Â Could I give you original chicken legs?Me: Â No, I think I've said very clearly. Â I WANT GRILLED CHICKEN. Â If you don't have grilled legs. Â Just surprise me with whatever you have.Then Lady 1 went preparing the food and Lady 2 was still checking the cell (maybe I should name her ""Cell Lady""). Â After Lady 1 finished, she said:Sir, we only have 3 grilled legs so I gave 3 original legs.Me: Â WHAT? Â I don't want original legs!Lady 1: Â Sorry, I meant grilled chicken wings (still in an annoyed tone).Me: Â Fine!I didn't say Thank You or Have a Nice (Fxxking) Day! Â I left with anger.If it was before, I would give a 4 star (3 for the food and 1 for the encouragement). Â But today, I am giving 1 because 0 is not an option. Â Why did KFC hire non qualified workers like them?I will still go to that store. Â But next time, if they act this shxt again, I will yell and I will make them embarrassed."

696,K6x7wyqA2iOBjWIhMvOBVQ,3/22/2022,5 star rating,"During our week in NYC my teen daughter and I experienced many amazing food moments. Our first day eating here we had a narrow time window when she was especially craving healthy food so we speed walked many blocks to get to Restaurant Row. We overshot our destination by just a few steps when my daughter stopped short and said we just passed it. I looked at her like ??? Then she said, ""I smell it. It smells fresh and healthy."" So we turned around, discovered the sign and headed downstairs to an oasis that looks and smells much like our favorite places in Portland, Oregon. Our favorite healthy eating places all share a common mission and certain types of ingredients. However, the real standout healthy living restaurants and cafes provide something innovative or unique, and that is what we found here. Eating here twice, we loved everything we tried on the menu, from a burger, the Thai salad, juices, smoothies and an aÃ§aÃ­ bowl. The dish we have a hard time imagining the rest of our lives without is the turmeric-protein bowl. Its menu description is accurate and yet the dish itself over delivers. The turmeric flavor is not overly strong, and the base is hard to describe but is like a warm pudding. We ordered this item our second time in when we returned with friends. My friend commented, ""This is its own thing. It's not something I've had before and you can't call it the same as other food items.""My daughter feels very inspired by the food we ate at Pure. Today is our first full day home and she's already online looking for how she can recreate some of the dishes. So you see, the food felt healthy, tasted amazing, the large portions proved very filling, and the food inspired. How many places achieve all that?"

705,65VJnrsaHS6NZejxnnu23A,5/6/2008,5 star rating,"It's everything a bar should be.-Great, funny bartenders: Treat 'em right and they'll buy you one back. -Cheap drinks (for NYC): $3 PBR on tap, if you can swing an extra dollar or two, there are several quality brews; $5 well drinks; good happy hour specials.-Games: Pool is the main reason I come in here. $1 games on a decent table. I love the graphite cues, most of which have a good tip on them...and there's almost always some good competition. Friday nights especially. Sadly, since it's right by my apartment, I tend to stop by as I'm stumbling home drunk, and I don't play so well.* Â They've also got Ms. Pacman, Space Invaders, and foosball.-Good jukebox: surprising variety, a lot of classic staples, and sometimes the crowd goes on a salsa kick.-Live music: I actually came in here a couple times before realizing that there's a pretty big room in the back with live acts almost every night. Â I saw a ""band"", I believe named Lady Ga-Ga, that consisted of two girls in lingerie, one of whom was very talented on the piano and had a beautiful voice. It appeared that the other girl's only purpose was to dance around in lingerie (no small contribution); at one point she turned on the record player and played ""Ace of Spades"" by Motorhead, and danced around some more. When the piano player/singer announced their last song, she confessed that they had planned at least 4 more, but they were too drunk to continue. Â If you don't think that's a great act...get some new taste. There's just a great vibe at Parkside. Sounds cliched, but you're going to run into all sorts of characters, of all different ages. Don't be scurred. Say hi, make a few new friends...no one's going to give you a hard time. If you want to come in by yourself and get shitcanned, that's not a problem either.*Yes, I am inserting this disclaimer so if you happen to beat me, I can still claim to be better than you."

On its face it might seem like your average dive bar, but there are some great features about Parkside that you should know:1. The bartender (at least on a Wednesday night) was a class act. No attitude at all and probably the nicest and most pleasant bartender I've had in a bar of this type maybe ever. 2. The trivia on Wednesday night is really fun! Sure, there were only a few teams playing and half were with my group of coworkers, but the host was funny and the questions were hard but not infuriatingly hard. 3. The bathroom was surprisingly very clean for a bar bathroom! Beyond those three things, what more could you ask for from a casual bar in the East Village? I'll definitely be back once the trivia bug strikes me again, or maybe just to chat with the gentlemanly bartender. Either way, it's not my last time at Parkside!"

I had to look at the photos again because I couldn't believe that we were talking about the same bar. People have loved this place on Yelp but I didn't! It's simply not my crowd. This is a divey bar that would be a spot for my dad and his friends to meet for a Guinness. This isn't the spot for a young female and her girlfriends.

She counts it and says ""This is only $8; it's $10.""I'm like ""But it says $4 on the menu.""Nonchalantly, she says ""It's an old menu.""Annoyed, I'm like ""Who uses an old menu.""She's like ""Who doesn't give a tip.""I'm like ""How can we possibly tip you? I only have $8. You won't take our card.""And she says ""Bc the card minimum is $20, so you can either pay or leave.""This is after we paid cover, our friend hasn't gone yet.

714,AvpB-RQgEW9N4Eip3l3cww,9/26/2022,1 star rating,"First and last time eating here. Â Starting from the top, the service was poor, rather quickly my waiter came and asked ""Do you know what you want"" I had barely gotten seated so I replied that I did not. Â I reviewed the menu and decided that there was too many wonderful sounding items to decide, so I would ask the waiter what the Buccaneer is known for and choose based on his recommendations. Â I waited for around fifteen minutes for him to return and when he did, he suggested a dozen or so different items, so I had to think about what he suggested, so he left and again didn't return for an unnecessarily long time (~10 - 15 min with my menu closed). Â When he returned I ordered the Chorizo omelet as that was among his first recommendations and it sounded delicious. At this point he also took my drink order (should have had a drink for 25-30 minutes). Â The food came out pretty quick but right away I noticed that the 'buttered' bread they brought was not what I asked for so they brought me the correct bread 'unbuttered'. Â The omelette didn't taste fresh, the avocado was more like guacamole and didn't have the typical fresh flavor, the taste of avocado wasn't there. Â The chorizo flavor was also not present and at first I thought they left it out when I found these very small cubes of meat which I suspect was the chorizo however they didn't have the typical chorizo texture / color / or taste that I'm familiar with. Â The peppers were one of the only ingredients that stood out. Â While they stood out they didn't taste fresh. Finally the salsa must have come out of a jar and there was no sour cream on my food. Â I was a bit distracted, so I figured I would slowly force myself to eat this disaster of a meal and then when my waiter came by to see how the food was I would let him know and hopefully get something better. But he never came. Â I ate about half of the omelet before I couldn't stomach any more. There was also very bland and barely acceptable tasting potatoes. Â Overall, the star of the meal was the unbuttered bread. Â When a waitstaff finally did stop by and ask me if it was ok, I said ""actually my meal was not very good"", he then asked me ""would you like it to go?"" Â and of course I said no. Then I thought that maybe when I paid at the register the woman would ask how everything was, but she didn't and honestly wasn't friendly. Apparently this place doesn't care about their quality of service or food. Â I should have heeded the other reviews talking about these same issues. Â I figure they had at least two opportunities to get me to come back and try something else, but since they passed on both I see no reason to waste my money or time here again. Â It's too bad because it's near my place and it seemed promising."

I couldn't get a lower sugar level for this because a syrup was used for it. There was lychee bits at the bottom with the coconut jelly. Nothing special. It was $3.50 for the drink itself and $.50 extra for tapioca or jelly, so it came out to be $4.00I know they have kitchen snacks they sell to compete with Vivi's and I've tried their popcorn chicken, I personally don't think it's as good as the popcorn chicken from Vivi's.

It's not a big deal, but I didn't like the girls attitude towards me when I pulled out my card. She did a 180, she interrupts me to tell the girl in the back to stop making my drink before turning back around to give me a bored look and purse her lips at me while I try to look for enough change. I didn't have but all she did was roll her eyes and give me really nasty attitude As a customer, I was really annoyed by her attitude. She could have easily said something to fix the situation. There was a store across the street that I was going to go to and get cash back but after her unprofessional behavior, I was immediately put off. She wasn't friendly or didn't apologize and give me a solution to the problem. What really bugged me was how she told the girl to stop making my drink when I could have gone to get more cash.

This place is it! Good Food, Good Drinks, and GREAT waitstaff.This place is a steal for their bottomless drinks AND unlimited food! The food is always made fresh, and the waiters will bring out whatever you request AND MORE (of course if it's part of the brunch menu). I have always, always, always left extremely satisfied. My favorite brunch dish that they serve is the Tuna Ceviche, Lamb barbacoa tacos, and Salmon. Favorite drinks are their Bloody Mary and Maya Mimosa. I always tell the waitstaff to keep all these dishes and drinks coming in rotation. They always make sure that we are happy, and have everything we need. If I have to say one thing that I wish Maya could improve on is the music, the place is so nice inside and has a lot of space, I think they could become more popular if they had a DJ come in and play some music to up the vibe a bit, make it more party brunch. With a couple drinks in everyone will be in the mood for some music. Will I be back here? OF COURSE already planning my next brunch outing at Maya."

There was not a long wait at all for the food and i was seated without a reservation on a Friday night with zero wait time. They asked for vaccination card which i love, as a lot of restaurants have become lax with that. One of my biggest measures of good service is how often the server comes with water refills on tap water. They were on point here!!! Super friendly and professional service and refills on water and mango margs (not pictured here) were perfect. The steak was cooked to perfection (we asked for medium rare and it was actually medium rare) and the appetizers were delicious as well. It was some of the best calamari I've ever had. Â The Mexican street corn could hav even more flavorful but i can't complain. Overall, great food and great service to match!"
735,65VJnrsaHS6NZejxnnu23A,7/7/2022,4 star rating,"Came here surprised to see that there were vegan options! Tried the chips and guac (mild, medium, and hot), the chayote squash tacos, and a mango margarita. The guac was yummy and the chips were slightly warm - would have been amazing with a sprinkle of salt and squeeze of lime!! The warmth of the chips makes me think they were made in house but the lack of seasoning makes me think otherwise. Paired with the guac though? Delicious. I loved the guac. There wasn't much of a difference in the spice levels though but I love how the guac had a mild medium and hot option because you never really see that for guac, It's usually for salsa, so I definitely appreciated that. The chayote square tacos were pretty bland and nothing really special so I had to ask for hot sauce and lemme tell you that hot sauce was hot! I LOVED IT. I definitely did not expect that heat after eating the guac that claimed to be hot. The hot sauce was thick, not too runny, and perfectly spicy! I wish I took some home haha I loved the heat- I definitely recommend asking for the hot sauce if you ever go here. The mango margarita was good! It tasted like straight up juice so that can be dangeroussss. It snuck up on me a couple sips in and I had to slow down hahahahahOverall I enjoyed the chips n guac, mango margarita, and hot sauce, the vegan chayote squash tacos were okay and on the bland side. But it's nice to know that this restaurant has vegan options in the first place so if you're ever here and get a vegan entree, make sure to ask for a side of their hot sauce! Overall rating would be 3.6/5 for me - good drinks and apps with a nice outdoor patio seating but lacked a bit of seasoning for me in the vegan department. The meat dishes smelled good though! Hopefully we can see more vegan options in the future? Maybe even a vegan dessert? Hehe (oh wait they have mango sorbet which I believe is vegan but I was really eyeing the churros and flan wishing they were vegan hahahahahah)"

Bring whatever he wanted to bring us. I didn't order any food at all. He just kept bringing me dish after dish. Nursing a rough night out our all you can drink option (additional $10/pp) was wasted but the Mexican Bloody Mary I had was incredible, zingy, spicy, lots of flavor and strong enough for me to say. Nope. Just one. The food flowed steadily from the kitchen even though we had a 90 minute seating time. We must have had well over a dozen dishes for just two people. The price can't be beat at $55/pp you can drink and eat as much as you like. I will definitely be back when I can get my all you can drink title back!"

I mean I always drive past it but never went in. They close at 10pm and we came here around 9:30pm. There was no line but people were still there getting food. Thy had selections ranging from salmon, macaroni,salt fish,rice and peas,oxtail, jerk chicken etc. Being that we came late I felt there were more selections because a guy was cleaning out the other side of the buffet area. They weigh by the pound but our food still came out to 18 and change with two plates. I was pleased. Â My moms plate came out to 12 because she had a lot of stuff on there.

I had curry chicken brown stewed chicken fried chicken oxtails steamed carrots and cabbage which wete all on point. The mac and cheese was bland and inedible. Here is the skinny on Jamaica Breeze. They rip people off. They saw that my relative was white and then looked in her container and charged her $24 for her meal based on the fact that she had three small shrimp in there. It cost us $46 for two people to eat at a place where there is no seating and no waitstaff.

I searched ackee and this place came up. Boy was dI surprised. For one I didn't know it was a buffet. They had at least 4 types of salt fish. Some with cabbage, plain, ackee, and okra. I scooped up some ackee and salt fish, okra, yellow yam, banana and a few dumplings. I had to taste the rice and peas. I was amped. Everything is weighed by the pound. I checked out the other items on the buffet. They have all the Jamaican staples from curry, brown stew chicken, oxtail, festival, plantains, and goat. They also have desserts and every type of Caribbean drink from fresh Sorrel, peanut punch and Ting. My food was very flavorful but not too salty. The dumplings were firm but soft enough to cut with my plastic cutlery. This place is amazing with fresh food, clean and inexpensive. Â It was so good that I went back the next day.

We arrived on a Sunday at 2pm. Street parking is available, but a little crowded. It took a minute or two to find a spot halfway down the block. Inside, the place was bustling. Food is served buffet style. Pay by the pound. Some seating is available. Nothing fancy about it, but everything is well kept and clean. The staff is friendly.All chicken dishes (curried, BBQ, sweet wings, jerk, stewed) were moist, tender and seasoned well. Oxtails melted in my mouth. Codfish salad was wonderfully balanced with a salty/vinegary taste. Curry tripe was delicate and tender with good flavor. Stewed peas are so tasty, they make you crave more. Beef and chicken patties, coco bread and desserts are behind the counter. Coco bread was fluffy and delicious. I was too full to eat the beef and chicken patties I bought, but they sure look good and freshly made. Definitely save room and treat yourself to the homemade strawberry cheesecake.

764,_-89MKTICre2Gj6Mq-qhDA,11/26/2020,4 star rating,"I ordered the gyukotsu ramen with wavey noodles. Hands down the best ramen I've ever had in NYC. Get the gyukotsu, please. I was hesitant and thought it would be bland and lack the savory and full flavor you get from pork broth and pork belly, but I was so wrong. It's perfect. The only reason this wasn't a 5 star review is because it's a $17 bowl that didn't fill me. But it's definitely 5 star flavor. The amount of noodles is fine, but the meat slices are small and there is only one long piece of menma. There's no egg or other filling ingredients for you to sink your teeth into, which is a shame because $2 to add an egg and $5 for more meat is a bummer. I know it's NYC prices and ramen is known to be more expensive here, but these eggs are not difficult to make and paying $2 for an egg is always ridiculous to me. However, they do give you the whole egg, unlike many other locations that will charge the same amount for half!"

It wasn't overwhelmingly spicy, but had a good kick. The broth was rich, but not as much as a pork broth would be (even though it was made with bone marrow!). Wish they offered different noodle options though.The chicken karaage was very good. I don't know if I would say ""borderline spectacular"" (what kind of a tool talks like that?). Definitely worth getting!Also, if you're in the area because you wanted to go to Other Half, they'll have some of the latest cans available!

769,_-89MKTICre2Gj6Mq-qhDA,12/20/2017,3 star rating,"Judging by the menu and the steer on the sign out front, Za-Ya Ramen is a beef broth ramen joint. Unfortunately, after slurping down a bowl, I can now confirm that I am a tonkotsu man all the way.Pork is the king of all the meats, and more importantly, pork fat is the king of all the fats. The gyukotsu ramen here, while quite pretty and served in an awesome ceramic bowl, just lacks the richness, the deep and satisfying flavor that comes with a good bowl of pork bone broth. I'm sad to say that the meat was under-seasoned and rubbery. Perhaps an egg would've helped the overall effect, but apparently I was supposed to add one on for an extra $2 and I didn't realize it wasn't standard. Either way, I'm just not that into it. Or you either, but this review is about ramen.That said, the Karaage (boneless fried chicken) is borderline spectacular. Perfectly fried, tender-as-an-Otis-Redding-song dark meat with a spicy mayo-based dipping sauce, I'd come back just to eat this chicken. That isn't the greatest compliment you can give a ramen shop, but I'm all about the positive. One last thing:If you do decide to give Za-Ya a shot, watch out for the walls. You generally don't have to worry about walls if you're a competent human with regular motor skills, but evidently that's not me. I somehow punched the wall while I was putting on my jacket. Damn those walls are sharp."

It packed in very quickly and I think we got the best seats in the house in the back left corner.The Ramen was delicious! You can tell they don't use MSG because the broth was light but still flavorful. We each got different choices and tried each others. The spicy broths were my favorite and the egg is always the best part in my opinion.The best part is they serve beer from Other Half Brewery next door.

Their appetizers seemed a bit on the plainer end so my friends and I only got ramen, which had a decent amount of choices. I saw miso, shio, and shoyu ramen, all of which I've had before elsewhere. I really wanted spicy ramen but the only option was beef bone broth so I asked our waitress if it was possible to switch it with another broth or make a non-spicy option spicy, but she said no to both questions. I understand that they probably have a system to how things work or they know what works and what doesn't work but their flexibility seemed very limited for a place that sells mainly ramen. My friend and I both chose the Shio Ramen while another friend got Miso Ramen. The broth tasted really weird. I couldn't pinpoint what it was but it wasn't your usual MSG restaurant ramen broth. The chicken breast was so bland, it tasted like the boiled chicken I give my dog. Their noodles seemed very homemade. They were flatter and wider than the typical ramen. I was OK with that but my Miso Ramen friend wasn't too fond of it. I used a lot of spice powder to mask the weird broth flavor, but my attempts were proven futile. Service was great though. We sat at the counter and stayed for a long time even after we were done (no one was waiting for a table). I like how they had hooks under the counter for people to hang their belongings (kind of like Japan style). There were four tables in the back and two high Â two people tables by the counter. So space is very limited. Parking should be fairly easy to find around here as it wasn't a busy area."

Highly recommend dining inside where they have an enclosed outdoor area (imagine a patio, open roof, enclosed section within the restaurant). Big fan of the decorations! I ordered the braised short rib and my friend ordered the roasted chicken. The amount of meat for the braised short rib was enough for me to take back home. It was soft and flavorful but not the most tender/juicy I've had. I relied heavily on the gravy which was consumed about half way through eating the meat. The veggies complemented the mashed potatoes well. The roasted chicken had a flavorful bite. The service was on-point as well with continual check-ins and notice of delays to our order. It was an overall pleasant experience and would dine again to try their other dishes!"

The chicken live and foie gras parfait ($16) was a highlight - super creamy and delicious and came with the accoutrements. Even came in the little glass container for delivery! The seasonal salad ($14) was pretty good but I would say a bit expensive for the price given the components were just like mixed salad, some cranberries, carrots, and walnuts, but decent portion.

When my friend wanted another glass of that (it was tasty apparently), she was refused bc at 11pm they don't serve any more drinks unless you're seated at the bar. So the bar is open but they won't serve you drinks at the table. That's bad business. They brought our burgers before we finished the appetizers. At least the food was good. Although the bone marrow was not warm enough, needed the kosher salt on the side and the middle of it was slimy so I couldn't eat it all. They also brought up the check without us asking for it or even a hint of apology , like , ""we are closing the kitchen so therefore we bring you the check"". No. The check just appeared. And if that isn't enough , we split the check only to discover that they charged one of the cards with the entire (!) bill and the other another half. Good my friend noticed. In three words... WTF?!. Two stars only bc food was tasty, but not enough to come back. Ever! And if you read my reviews you know I am rarely Â giving bad reviews. I don't recall such experience in really long time! I don't think they were short-staffed. There were plenty of staff moving around. They were just bad, except the host."

We were literally the only people in that entire section for the duration of our brunch. I was totally fine with being back there alone, it was kind of nice, but why make such a big deal about seating us....!?We chose 4 separate things, Chicken and waffles, eggs on avocado toast , Irish breakfast and huevos rancheros.My oldest son was having the Irish breakfast which had bacon sausage, egg; beans, black pudding, mushroom, egg; toast. So I asked if I could have a sandwich with bacon egg and sausage (all ingredients in the same dish). The server behaved as if I had just asked for a blue lobster or something. She then came back and said there was ""no way"" the kitchen could make it.....When the food arrived my huevos rancheros were a huge disappointment. The eggs were cold, and the whole thing was sat in a watery mess, I guess from the beans, which made the tortillas totally soggy. So yes, cold and soggy. My wife's eggs on avocado toast were also cold. The Irish breakfast came with only 1 sausage (despite saying sausages plural on the menu. It actually says served with sausages from Myers of Keswick. Kind of a rip off to just give you 1 sausage and charge over $20.). Â My youngest sons waffles were probably the best part, nice and crispy, but by then I was already fed up.Probably the worst part was the service. The place has a cool interior, and we used to come here a lot. But the original chef / owner opened something else and food quality declined. Have not been back for a while. Our server was not very friendly, she barely checked on us in an empty room, and she gave the vibe that she couldn't care less if we were happy. Wanted to tell her about the cold eggs but she was missing in action until it was time to collect the check.Combine this with the initial drama at the door to feel blessed that we actually got a table and it was kind of a frustrating experience. We enjoy family brunch together and have several favourites on the UES, this used to be one, but after today it reminded us why we stopped coming. Â Needs a management overhaul."

The grilled cheese will change your life and is the perfect starter for your table if you have a party of four people!

The fish and chips was not the greatest. Really too much fried batter and made it really hard to enjoy the fish friedness combo. If the fried aspect was taken down a notch, it would be really good."

A place I've frequented for 10 years even after moving out of the neighborhood. However after my last few experiences there I have to update my review and sadly start to look elsewhere for a go to spot on the UES. Things that happened the last two times I went (or rather tried to go):2-3 weeks ago I went and my Scotch egg was horrible. Completely over salted and the breading on the outside was clearly hastily done because it was completely falling apart when it was served to me.One of the bar tenders was pretty openly complaining about the staff and lack of help, and how he was quitting so that was a bit uncomfortable and made for a less than chill atmosphere- also made me concerned for how the staff are being treated there.Then I tried to go again recently and we didn't have a reservation as there were none available until very late but were happy to sit at the bar (3 of us). We got to the door and the hostess told us to just wait outside (it was raining)- the door area wasn't crowded at all and she was very short with us and pushy so that was off putting. Then another guy came out and we said we didn't have a reservation and he said the only table available was an extremely small table outside meant for two people. We declined and he said ""you should've made a reservation"" and left it at that. Didn't suggest or offer for us to sit at the bar despite seats being available. Just an incredibly off putting, unwelcoming experience. A shame because for so long that was never the vibe going there. The staff they have currently are not very friendly it seems.I would like to give it another go but I am not feeling confident about it at all. Being a long time patron and then to have these experiences just really was a letdown."

It had just enough of the hops with a floral flavor. Tried the Scotch eggs for starter and the pan fried Atlantic salmon for entree. Both were pretty good. The service was extremely slow however. I'm not sure what the staffing situation was but everything took a long time to arrive and also we had to constantly flag down our waiter to get something we needed. Our waiter also made a mistake of overcharging our credit cards. Overall, I don't mind coming back here to try more items on the menu"

I was slightly disappointed at the size of my fish in the burger. I also tried the shepherd's pie made with minced lamb. While it is probably how it tasted traditionally, I thought the the lamb was too strong. Maybe something like rosemary or other herbs would make ir more palatable.

All the perched seating was taken so I sat at the only available seat at a lower seating space available facing the window. I like the wooden wall with glowing light behind it. I don't like that most if not all these Chipotle restaurants now need a code to enter the restroom.The young lady taking my order had a smile and was very pleasant, got my order right and as diners were finishing eating the tables were wiped. Tables and soda fountain/condiment area were clean.I always notice people ordering bowls and I always order the burrito, so I ordered a bowl. I can now say my first Chipotle bowl experience was had at this location. I'm not scared of carbs, so I think I'll stick with the burrito because it feels like it fills up my stomach more. What does everyone else think? You get more in the bowl or the burrito? Anyway, pretty average experience except the bin of Barbacoa was running low so I ordered something I knew I shouldn't have because I knew the quality wasn't going to be good: cubes of steak, instead of my normal Barbacoa/Carnitas. The Sofritas was piled high, guess Chipotle customers don't really come for tofu? The bins of steak didn't look too appetizing, a bit dry. Same taste in the order, the cubed steak is not very flavorful and a bit dry. I'm not expecting filet mignon but for the price, yeah, works for me with all those add ins like salsa, guacamole, sour cream and corn mixed in, etc...Even though Chipotle has slumped a bit I'm still a fan ever since my first experience in 2004. And this location is Andrew approved."

I'm not much of a fan of bar food so usually when I'm having cocktails I like to opt out of the food served there. Ollie has changed the game for me. Their food menu is relatively healthy if you ask me. I had their veggie burger with fries and it was just the right amount to accompany the 2 cocktails that I ordered. My friend had got the Ollie burger and she really enjoyed that as well. The drinks itself were beyond what I had expected. Each drink was so unique and tasteful. The indoor scene was quite nice and exactly what we were looking for. It had that bar scene but with brighter lighting. They had tables spread out pretty well so there is still some privacy if you're looking to go on a date here. Overall 10/10 experience. Highly recommend checking out Ollie!

I would say bartenders are knowledgeable and take pride in making their drinks. Me being a old school martini guy I tried to stump them with a couple of orders.The first drink I ordered was a vesper. I asked if they could make it. To be honest most places cant make it because either they don't have Kinnel Lillet or Cocchi Americano or just straight up don't know how to make it. The first thing they said was ""sure of course."" I was skeptical at first but then was like okay let me watch how you make it. I watched and they did it right. Ice in the glass, gin, vodka and Cocchi Americano (even tho I like Kinnet Lillet). Taste wise I was very surprised. A little on the sweet side but regardless a well made cocktail. Would only say next time shaken not stirred, but who am I James Bond?!?! Overall I still loved it a 5/5I had 2 dirty martinis afterwards. I can honestly say it was one of the better dirty martinis I have had. Most places in Manhattan that I have been to either put too much olive brine or too much vodka. This had the perfect balance and was delicious. 5/5 for sure.I came here by accident and I can thoroughly say I am glad I stumbled into here by accident. If you're ever in the neighborhood, give them a try. Highly recommend."

The seating area was a bit weird - the tables on one side were packed very tightly together, and then a lot of open space in the middle (that could have been used so that tables were not sitting elbow-to-elbow with other tables).The cocktails sounded good, and looked pretty....but were quite forgettable on the taste scale (had the #3 and #5).The odd part of the experience: when we were done with our first round of cocktails, our server walked by and informed us that the table was only for an hour and a half, so we had ~45 mins left. It would have been nice to have known that when we made the reservation, or even when they seated us. We were barely through our cheese plate, so we decided not to order more drinks or food there and went elsewhere instead for the rest of the night :/"

Honestly I was really surprised after my first bite that a cocktail-driven spot would have such fresh seafood and if was just done perfect. Refreshing and enough complex of flavor.*Charcoal Carrot - very very good as well. I prefer a bit more charred so it's softer and burnt on the skin. But my friend also loves that you can still taste the carrot flavor.*Squash & Ricotta - what can go wrong with this?!After the amazing bites from our first 3 food order, we added the Brazilion Cheese Bread & Short Rib Sandwich.

The drinks are extremely high quality/tasty and the menu changes a little every season. I have tried at like five or six different one and I've loved every single one of them.

The Tuna Crudo is excellent, one of the best I've had. Pao de Queijo is a wonderful cheese bread from Brazil, it's delicious and goes really well with the scallion cream cheese and honey it's served with. I enjoyed the Charred Carrots more than the Roasted Brussels, but both were honestly quite good. The Ollie Burger was phenomenal - I asked for some hot sauce to go with it, and they brought out a habanero hot sauce made in-house. They need to make bottles of this stuff, it's that good.

This is such a cute spot for a quick lunch that feels nicer than your typical fast casual spot. There is plenty of sitting indoors and also an outdoor area with a few tables and a roof. The decor inside is beautiful and clean, giving the place a very Â fresh and bright energy. You order and pay at the counter and get your food right away. We decided to sit inside since it was nice and air conditioned. For food my friend ordered the Tibetan Mama which was apparently delicious and very filling, the portion size was large and there seemed to be a balanced ratio between curry and rice. I ordered the Botanical salad with added tofu. This salad was so good, fresh, and filling. It came with plenty of lettuce and quinoa as well as pickled veggies and a superseed avocado which I am not even sure how to begin describing but it was delicious-- covered in crunchy seeds and seasoned with mild spices that went very well with the buttery creaminess of the avocado. The tofu additional topping was also great and well flavored (maybe a tiny bit too salty for my taste) but it was a nice way of adding extra protein to this dish. Loved this place and will make sure to return to try their other dishes and desserts! Great location and super cute spot. A bit on the pricier end but this is expected from organic/vegan food in NYC.

When it comes to food you can be sure it will.be unique and fresh but the tastes are not as familiar as you'd imagine. The beet juice with the ginger is refreshing but hits you the first sip (think a lot of ginger !).I tried the summer roll (no substitution allowes) and it felts like a salad that sits uneasy with itself haphazardly combined into a roll. It is filling, as is the Omega 3 brownie which combines a filling guilt free snack/dessert with a cure for constipation. The red fruit Chia pudding though I can fully.get behind.

Â I wouldn't recommend it.I'm not vegan, but I have no issue eating at vegan/veg joints. I went to Le Botaniste with friends, and got the Chili Sin Carne. Â It's a simple bowl of veg chili over rice, which shouldn't be that hard to pull off. Â But no aspect of it was good. Â The brown rice was overcooked and a bit mushy, for starters. Â It shouldn't be hard to cook the rice properly. Â Either the chili or the rice or something included was somehow watery, meaning that the overcooked rice was sitting in a shallow pool of water at the bottom of the bowl.These sins could be forgiven if the basic taste and flavor of the chili was great, but it wasn't. Â It was just generic and uninspired. Â The whole meal was distinctly single-texture and felt like one big pile of mush, frankly. The flavors did not stand out in any way. Deeply disappointing and just bad.This is probably a bit of unfair speculation, but it honestly feels like the restaurant has put far more time into the visual and aesthetics of being a super hipster vegan artiste #trending place than they have into the actual food. The workers wear artist-style white jackets. Everything is very posh and the food station is arranged with artful twee little bowls. It's pretentious without having the quality to back up that pretension, and I can't help but wonder if the image of 'next cool thing' and the aesthetics are what people are responding to. Or maybe I just caught them on a bad day. But I've eaten at very good veg places before, but this wasn't it."

817,Kh0-HmlgmVUkRxR55_Vn1g,4/2/2022,3 star rating,"I am grateful for vegan options on the Upper West. That said, it's crazy expensive and not the place to go after skipping lunch and working til 6 as the heartier options are basically curry, jackfruit, or bolognese (yawn). I made my own bowl and that and a small glass of wine were $40. I was full after so there's that. But the food wasn't that tasty or well crafted. It tastes like cafeteria food from the 90s made by non-vegans in a place with very few vegetarians. Temperature, balance and flavor were all a bit off. I regretted not going to sweet green or dig inn, where the vegetables are handled more expertly. On the plus, people working at the cafe were really friendly and helpful and made going there pleasant. It is also a cute space that feels intimate and yet spacious. Maybe I will come back and try soup or the botanical bowl."

Â They have grilled meats on a spit behind the counter and you ask for whatever cuts of meat you like. Â I had bacon covered sausages, sirloin, roast beef and skirt. Â The skirt was a little dry but still delicious and sausages and sirloin was good. Â The roast beef was actually my favorite. Â It was cooking on the spit so I asked for a slightly rare cut and it was beefy delciousness.The hot food bar is great. I don't know the names of the foods available but there was this vegetable stew thing that you could ladle on to rice which was amazing. Â The cold food bar was also great. Â The collard green salad wasn't seasoned as other Brazilian places I've been to but it was still delicious and made me feel slightly better about myself with all the meat I was eating.You pay everything by weight and a good plate came out to around 7 or 8 bucks."

825,zuxZtAredHPR1wrx12g1ng,4/18/2010,3 star rating,"My son found this place on Yelp while we were looking at colleges in the NYC area. it is good for a buffet, but not quite as great as we had hoped it would be, so i just gave it 3 vs. 4 stars. Items that were below my expectation are explained below. I would still recommend it, though, for the following reasons. 1. The folks who work here are friendly, sincere and just great.2. It's fast.3. The Brazilian BBQ beef (Picanha) and the sausage (linguica) were both very good. stick to these as the centerpiece of your meal.4. Fresh veggies in the buffet.5. Economical.I would avoid most of the ""cooked and sitting there"" stuff in the buffet. My son tried some of the roast-like meat that was there along with some of the other stuff and it was dry and buffet-like. Granted, we were there after 8pm and perhaps this is not the prime time to hit the buffet as turnover seemed to be low. Nonetheless, the gap between the meats that were fresh off the Churrasco (sp?) grill were the bargain here. Since your meal is charged by the pound ($6.99/lb. at this writing), you really want to optimize for the ""good things"" which are the aforementioned meat and fresh veggies. Of course, it's a bargain at this price so you could just tank up and leave the undesirables, but why? Another thing to avoid are the fresh juice drinks in the tanks near the counter. We found them watery and not very flavorful. Once again, perhaps it's one of those end-of-day issues, or perhaps we just don't get it when it comes to authentic Brazilian fruit drinks, but for my money, I'll take a water or soda next time.I have posted a photo of our plates captioned ""Paul S dinner at PB"".The restaurant is small, and decorated with items memorializing the homeland. I imagine if you came here while it was busy, you'd have trouble sitting inside. Overall, fast, cheap, friendly and reasonably good food if you pick the right things. Come here, but follow the narrow path to the BBQ."

Food is always fresh and service is super nice. It is buffet style and have a lot of selection of veggies, hot entrees, and BBQ meat alike. Some of their best dishes are the fish and the BBQ meat. They have a nice variety of vegetarian options which is also pretty nice, ranging from quinoa, kale, and beans. Be aware of the pasta dishes though. They look pretty delicious but most of the time it's not seasoned properly and is overcooked. If you're looking for a quick bite, the coxinhas Â (deep fried chicken ball) are super good. Sometimes they have the cheese option which they stick a cube of cream cheese in there and it is absolutely delicious. If you're craving some dessert, the passion fruit mousse is the way to go. One of the popular Brazilian desserts out there and they know how to do it right. As the Brazilians say... Chao! :)"

I came by on a weekday morning and got the bbq pork sandwich, pasteis de nata, and chocolate almond scone. Everything was absolutely incredible. I didn't know this until I got there, but the pictures don't do these pastries justice - their pastries are all massive!! I'm glad I got the half sandwich, because even that is big. The scone was like half scone and half croissant, since it had a lot of thin, flaky layers. Prices are reasonable, especially considering portions. They have really pretty outdoor seating on the patio, too! And I love that they don't play music, or if they do, it's quiet. As someone who likes to work in silence, it's quite refreshing to not have to endure annoying background music. Come early for the best pastry selection."

They also have the widest selection of vegan goodies I've seen in any local bakery. My friend got the chocolate croissant today, and it was flaky and delicious. There is a great amount of space indoors, as well as a cute backyard or sidewalk seating for warmer days. A good study spot, and I regularly see folks there with books or laptops. There's an espresso bar and more substantial brunch\lunch items for those who want them (or arrive after all the pastries are sold out!). Yum!"

Unfortunately, this $15 Breakfast sandwich has ZERO flavor. ZERO seasoning. I do not eat bacon so maybe that's why everyone else loves it? I don't know but I cannot even finish the other half!! On top of that, the menu says the sandwich comes with their Rocket salad. When I didn't receive one, I asked and was told that it doesn't come with a salad but they will give me one anyway. Wasn't really sure how to feel about that because it says you do on the menu -- but ok. I was grateful for some greens nonetheless. This ""salad"" is literally ONLY arugula!! I mean, come on. This is not a salad. I paid $18 for what exactly?? I should have gone to the spot I usually go to. I was hoping this would be my new place since it's so close to me :("

847,cKGi-erQrad9lf87VH6cjA,2/7/2021,4 star rating,"Stopped at Simple Loaf Bakehouse for lunch on Sunday afternoon. A wonderful bakery with more than enough baked goods to make anyone happy.Quality: Tried out numerous items from Simple Loaf Bakehouse. I'll start with the weakest item, which was still pretty good, the Large Iced Latte. They clearly put a lot of effort into their beverages, but they are not up to the same level as the baked items. The Park Slope Sourdough Loaf is magnificent, and assured me that any bread item you order is a good option. The two danishes we tried, Apple Danish and Savory Danish with Roasted Mushrooms, Caramelized Onion, and Feta were equally as delicious. The last item we tried was the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich. The actual pulled pork was just okay, but the baguette it was served on was excellent. Quantity: Large portion sizes for all the food items we tried. Standard size coffee and espresso drinks.Value: $4.50 for a Large Iced Latte. $6 for a Park Slope Sourdough Loaf. $4 for an Apple Danish. $5 for a Savory Danish. $14 for a BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich.Ambiance: Simple Loaf Bakehouse is a cute little bakery found in the Park Slope area of Brooklyn. Currently they have an outdoor area built out front, but they also have an outdoor space in the back. To prevent guests from traveling throughout the shop, they are sticking to just the front outdoor area for now. When you enter they have all their breads and baked goods on display. They have a second indoor room, which is currently empty, but I assume usually houses some tables and chairs. Crowd: With the limit on number of customers permitted inside, there is almost always a line outside. And even in the cold weather you will find guests sitting at snow covered tables in front with coffee and pastries.Service: Lovely staff, who are extremely passionate about their products. They also are very careful with COVID restrictions, limiting the number of customers in the shop at any time.Parking: A fair amount of street parking in the area."

It reminds me of all of the lovely, family run restaurants I visited in Italy, and their food is just as authentic and delicious.We had their meat and cheese plate, spaghetti in meat sauce, classic lasagna, hazelnut mousse and Nutella crepe cake. We loved how generous the servings of the meat and cheese plate were, and that the pasta dishes tasted incredibly delicious with a perfect balance of sauce, pasta, and meat. The desserts were to die for as they were super rich and artfully presented, and paired well with limoncello and amaretto imported from Italy.If you get the chance, I highly recommend dining in. Bruna and John are kind and lovely people and you feel welcomed as soon as you step in the door.

Went with a colleague yesterday for lunch... the service was fantastic, very friendly, attentive and helpful, both the waitress and the chef/owner. The food, though, may have eclipsed even the excellent service. Started with a complimentary toasted bread with olive oil and sundries tomato/eggplant spread that was superb. Very different from the usual bread and butter or even olive oil and seasoning.Appetizer was a special, Buffalo mozzarella with olive oil, prosciutto Di Parma, roasted peppers and cherry tomatoes... creamy, salty, fresh, just perfect.For our meals we both went with the same special, an amazingly light gnocchi that was explained as being more ricotta than potato. It showed as it was very light and airy, not nearly as dense and heavy as nearly every gnocchi I've ever had. This was served in a stew-like red sauce of tender osso bucco meat and topped with a dollop of ricotta. I was full halfway through but still finished it,m... if you get the change to try this definitely Fogo for it though I don't think you could go wrong here with any dish. On top of that, they even treated us to complimentary hazelnut spread covered cream puffs. It wasn't a cheap meal, but it wasn't overly expensive either, keeping in mind you get what you pay for and this place clearly only uses top notch ingredients. Highest recommendation, absolutely check out Dolce Fantasia next time you find yourself in Staten Island, you won't be disappointed!"

First, I was told one amount over the phone, when it arrived there was another amount with some tax. Now to the food, the shrimp rolls were shoggy and the food was bland but its manageable.

However, I decided to give them another shot today and ordered off of Seamless. I received my order today, although it was a lunch special, I got about 3 pieces of chicken and a scoop of rice (which was supposed to be jasmine rice, but is just plain white rice). The curry is extremely watered down, is not spicy at all, and barely has any flavor to it. If your food is of this sub-par quality, at least make up for it in service or by giving larger portions. The guy called when he arrived and didn't say Hi or anything, just said ""Your food here"", and hung up. Okay, fine. I go downstairs to get my food, and he is double parked on the street. He doesn't meet me at the door, and his tinted windows are rolled up. So I don't even know if that was him to begin with. I walk towards the car and then he opens the door and hands me the food without saying a word, and drives off. I am NEVER ordering from here again nor am I ever going to eat at their restaurant.

I got the Crab Cake Benedict and the portion size was generous but not too crazy, so I didn't feel bloated afterwards. The crab flavor was delicious, and the aioli was decadent but not too heavy. Their coffee is La Colombe which I love, and it's only $2 for the iced coffee which is amazing. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a quick, reliable weekend brunch!"

It felt like we were an inconvenience to the waitstaff when we asked for milk and sugar for coffees and had to ask again for a tea when it was not provided with all other drinks.

The street is closed to cars which greatly reduces noise level (essential for old souls). Very cute and clean outdoor patio. Staffs were friendly and attentive. We got their signature burger and smoked salmon Benedict. Both came in generous portions. My potato wedges had crispy shells and it's flavor was well blended with onions and bell peppers. Hollandaise sauce was on the lighter side. The burger was less memorable - a bit greasy and could probably cut on the salt. Price is around $20-$30/person depending on drinks, very reasonable for brunch/lunch."

My friend and I were trying to find a brunch spot over the weekend, and we decided to give this place a try! A super mom-and-pop like cafe, really cozy and has solid food. The Burger Queen Deluxe exceeded my expectations. At first glance, it looks like a really basic burger, almost one that you would get at a fast-food spot. But the taste is 10000x better than any fast-food burger. Something just hits. Highly recommend the Croque Madame too. Perfect mix of gooey cheese and slices of piled ham smacked in between 2 semi-crispy pieces of toast. Super home-y feel good vibes. Fries are the thin-kind, which made it all the better. It gets super busy here, but friend and I opted to seat at the bar so we only waited 5-10 minutes on a Sunday afternoon at 2pm. Otherwise, for a regular table, the waiter said we'd have to wait at least 30 min. Just as a heads up, but I would say the wait is worth it regardless!!"

I got an order of Pad See Ew with mock duck, and Red Curry with tofu. We also ordered some fried tofu and crab cheese wontons because, why not. The Pad See Ew was nice a flavorful as well as the curry. A nice selection of vegetables in the curry, not overloaded with onions and peppers like a lot of places. Crab cheese wontons were even a wee bit fancier then the usual and a little more tasty with some scallion. I probably will skip the tofu app next time, not because it wasn't tasty but because it's just boring.We are giving To B Thai three starts because the actually delivery was a bit of a fail. The bag came soaked in curry sauce and ripped open and made a huge mess. I recommend they use a better container in order to avoid this. We lost about 40% of our curry and had a lot of clean up to do. All our food was covered in curry. We also requested no utensils and got the full work up."

They have a tv that always has sports playing, guess they have sports fans working there. The service is good and the quality is good. I will be coming back."

It's not outstanding, blow you away good but it does the job if you are craving some Pad Thai. Generally, that's all that I would get or a spring roll. Or I'll splurge with getting shrimp Pad Thai. I'm a creature of comfort. The place in itself is pretty small for dining in and not insanely clean looking. It's a take-out kind of spot. The only large beef I have with them (no pun intended) is that I feel their food is a tad over-priced. Close to $10 for mediocre noodles in a neighborhood that isn't Park Slope. Don't get a hot head. I'd eat here more frequently if they had all day special combos or were like a buck or two cheaper."

887,Q02uPdw8j8yDIVSPyJATjA,7/24/2018,1 star rating,NOT WORTH IT. Â The food is a bit too pricy and on top of that the food is not yummy at all. The shrimp roll is blank as well as their calamari. Their shrimp dumpling is extremely doughy and can barely even taste any shrimp. Their drunken noodle is wayyy to spicy although I asked them not to make it spicy. I would never ever go back.

Love how most of the ingredients are local and they tell you from where on a chalkboard in the shop. Very Portlandia. The miso ginger dressing is a must, as are the fresh shrimp, basmati rice and those fluffy pieces of wheat bread. After eating this for dinner, I woke up the next morning feeling so much more energized! The price is the biggest downside: you're paying $14 for your custom-made delicious salad, which is like eating a burger at Westville and leaving a tip. Totally ridiculous.

Give it a shot when you visit. The Owl Farm is pretty rad. I went on a Friday night. The candles were burning, the music wasn't too loud, it was kind of romantic and I wasn't expecting that --but I'm certainly not mad about it! There are some beautiful selections on their beer menu. The Breakside Wanderlust IPA was a hit! I'll be going back for sure."
899,VXB2v7QVe2APSgeSqpmdGw,3/31/2016,4 star rating,"This place is a hoot. Beer selection galore. Beers, beers, and more beers. Beer weeks. Beer months. Beer beer beer. You see where this is going right?They have one of the largest and most diverse selection of taps here. All of which are at a pretty good price. They sometimes feature certain beers for a week that are all a certain criteria or style. They don't serve food here, but that's no biggie. They let you bring food in. The place does carry a delicious taco smell from time to time. They have one small television in here, so I wouldn't suggest you come here for any big games, unless you and your friends get here early. And even then you'll have to deal with the bartenders opinions of sports. Listen, we all know Tom Brady is a cheater. Stop your love obsession with him. If you're looking for some new and interesting beers, this could be your spot."
900,VXB2v7QVe2APSgeSqpmdGw,2/3/2016,5 star rating,"This is easily turning slowly into one of my favorite Brooklyn craft beer bars. It's owl themed for one thing. I have a small obsession with owls and when I see them all over the walls in cute decorative art work, I internally squeal with delight. The vibe is so chill and laid back. It's dark, a little grungy, but with dimly lit candle lighting. Pinball machines are in the back. There is no food but they allow outside food. If Bagel Pub (not a bar but a great idea for a bar) is open next door they make great bagels. If not, there's various taco joints across the street. I feel like the no food bars are the ones that really tend to just focus on those beers. The menu is usually one of the best beer menus I've seen aside from the Double Windsor with carefully selecting very unique ales and changing them at an insanely frequent rate. Also, happy hour is until 7pm every day and you get a buck off your beverage. Recently came in and tried their Mystic Spectral Evidence (12% abv) as well as their Eric More Cow Bell Milkstout from Singlecut.Note, they also let you pick the size of your beer in 8/12/16 oz pours for most things. Very reasonably priced and I must say pouring beer into a wine goblet glass is genius because whatever I was poured seemed way more than 8 or 12oz. They also do a sampler of 4oz pours for whatever you feel like drinking off the menu. They just halve the price of what an 8oz is for each one and boom - mini beer flight!"

They have board and card games to play which is always a nice addition. The beers are priced like all the surrounding bars at about $8 a beer. They have a good amount of beers to choose from on their menu. Really liked the vibe of this bar and would recommend going there!"
903,VXB2v7QVe2APSgeSqpmdGw,1/12/2016,5 star rating,"The Owl Farm should be the second or third stop on any Park Slope suds crawl (The first being The Gate or Mission Dolores). I didn't say first because once you start hanging out here with the very well-curated tap list featuring names like Cigar City, Other Half, Goose Island, Hill Farmstead and several others depending on the week it may very well be your last stop. Coupled with pinball machines and plenty of good eats nearby it should be. Most weekend nights it's raucous enough to celebrate with friends and during the day chill enough to read a book with some of the east coast's best brews.With the woody interior and dim lighting it's not a bad place to bring your date after you've treated her to the 9pc chicken McNuggets a few doors down."

Not crowded, nice bartender, no loud music, and a unique/changing draught list.On a Saturday afternoon, only one bartender in the place, but only 5-10 patrons altogether. Space is bigger than it looks, with comfortable seating in the back and huge bar seating up front. Another plus: pet friendly. So many dogs to pet that walk in and out. Bartender even puts out some treats and water for them. A+ Service.Beer list is fantastic, although the stronger ones only get 8oz pours. Another drawback, no food to speak of.

I was here on the Sunday before MLK Day around 10:00 p.m. I couldn't believe that the bar was completely full! I grabbed a table near the bar. The lit candles on each table give it a romantic and semi rustic feel. It's dark in here so the candles do act as a personal light when you're looking at the drink menu. I started with a pale ale on draft- the citron per the bartender's recommendation. It was light, airy. Pretty good. I then went for a cider on draft which was very good. The sugar makes me very guilty. I wish there were backs on the seats. I found myself slumped over with an aching back by the end of the night. I did not have any food so I can't rate it. I do like that it's a low key place but still nice. It's very tasteful. The staff is easygoing and doesn't bother you unless you need something. What a great place for a date. I'd like to come back!"

However, I do enjoy the cooked items that they have as toppings such as the mushrooms, squash, and toasted chick peas. The squash is flavorful and the chick peas add a nice texture. The chicken and mushrooms are more premium items and cost more but they add only a little. The sweet potato is thin slices and were really salty but I'm sure that was only a one time thing. My friends also ordered with me but they left out their dressings which disappointed them. Overall, decent salad."

The blood orange gelato was also really good -- not too sweet, and I discovered what sunchokes are (almost like the crispy part of a french fry.) The service was also impeccable, and the whole place had a cool, cozy vibe. (And apparently romantic too, since there was a couple hard-core making out in the lobby lounge when we left.)"

925,Z5FKUxsLDi5LznSrmH-ISg,1/10/2018,1 star rating,"Tonight I must write about one of the worst dining experiences that I have ever had in New York City.I was catching up with a friend as we have not seen each other since long before the holidays.We wanted somewhere with a cozy, intimate atmosphere, and we thought Margaux was going to be just the spot.Upon arrival, it was very busy in the front by the fireplace, so we took to the back for a private dining table. When we approached the host stand, there was nobody to be found for a good 5mins before we noticed a bartender run to the back and grab someone.A gentleman approached the stand and proceeded to take us to a table. We requested a table situated in the back room and were met with the response that they (the staff) were currently eating and it wasn't open yet but we could be moved after. Fine, we sat at the nice oversized booth closer to the front.After sitting and getting comfortable we ordered two hot toddy's, which were lukewarm and not necessarily ""hot.""Still trying to be optimistic, our very inattentive Server came over and took our food order.We proceeded to receive our meal, which was incorrect. Instead of our Server apologizing, we were told he thought we ordered the ""other chicken sandwich.""We decided to split our meals at this point so we could start eating, not once ever being met with an apology or asked how we were, or if we needed another drink.Our meal arrived and our Server was nowhere to be found until all of our plates removed and dessert was offered. After declining dessert, we were again not asked about our meal and never brought the check until asking almost 25mins later.When we received our bill, we asked to kindly split it and we were told that ""you don't do that.""I had to explain that X amount was to be placed on the card and the rest would be placed in cash.A very confused Server left and never brought any change back.We sat waiting.....again, until we flagged the very kind Runner down to call for our Server.After he came over, we again explained what we were trying to do, only to be met with more confusion.We finally settled the bill and received the proper change after the 3rd attempt.I am 100% understanding of mishaps, but in a non-busy restaurant, when half the staff is on their phones at the host stand and serving station, it's unacceptable.Hands down one the most frustrating and disappointing experiences I have had dining in a long time for what was supposed to be a simple and quick meal."
926,Z5FKUxsLDi5LznSrmH-ISg,3/15/2020,1 star rating,"Went here for some late night drinks and had a nightmare of an experience. The manager there, I think his name was Mike, was extremely rude and ill mannered. Five minutes before closing he started kicking everybody out with very aggressive tone and body language. Started going table to table harassing people telling them ""you need to get out, now!"" As it was happening everyone was just in shock. What is worse outside, he started yelling that everyone that was there, were ""garbage"". This is a white man, in his 40s I think, telling some Black women that they were garbage, in the middle of NYC. We just could not believe it. On top of that as he is leaving we see he is leaving with a woman, so we assume that that was the reason he was in such a hurry. What a shame, this guy needs a new job and they need a new manager."
927,Z5FKUxsLDi5LznSrmH-ISg,1/17/2016,5 star rating,"Exceptional Christmas eve dinner. The cauliflower 'pudding' was memorable and the Amish half roasted chicken was by far, the tastiest I've ever had in a restaurant. The gnocchi was a huge hit, as was the meat and cheese board. Looking forward to a return visit!!"
928,Z5FKUxsLDi5LznSrmH-ISg,6/9/2017,2 star rating,"I have to come here with my coworkers a few times a month because it's conveniently located near our headquarters. The service has been painfully slow each time--something I can typically forgive as we often set up shop and work on our laptops for hours on end (making sure to obviously continue purchasing food and beverages so we're not loitering). Also, I worked in the service industry for years, so I'd like to think I'm a bit more understanding than the average patron. Today, my colleague and I waited an hour and half for water. The place--which is charming, by the way, so this is really a shame--was nearly deserted as it was early in the afternoon. I went up to the bar to ask for water, and the bartender (who had no visible customers) pointed to a server who was standing against a wall. ""Water? Sure, I'll get your water,"" he said. Two glasses landed on our table about 10 minutes later. The servers essentially run away as soon as they drop things off, so ordering anything is a real journey. With the exception of maybe two people, everyone who works here seems to be collectively miserable and totally unwilling to provide decent service. It's bizarre. Even requesting a menu is a herculean effort. There is a real attitude here as well, as if everything is inconveniencing them. I really can't comprehend it. It's unfortunate that it's like this because it really is a cute place, and as I mentioned it's convenient. If it weren't for the awful service I would make this go-to spot for drinks, dinners, and dates. I wish they would step it up."

Absolutely disgusting and unsanitary in my opinion"
930,SdQsynrdEjalHmiZ9lK5dw,10/18/2021,3 star rating,It was just ok to me. I've had much better slices of Sicilian pizza. Theirs seemed too dry and not enough sauce for my liking. They have an outside seating area which was nice. Obligatory pictures on the wall to look at featuring random celebs who have supposedly dropped in here for pizza.
931,SdQsynrdEjalHmiZ9lK5dw,7/9/2022,4 star rating,Great pizza. Pretty much $5 a slice if you get one with toppings. We went a couple of times and they always had different choices and were making fresh pizzas. This ended up being our to-go spot on an evening when we wanted something to eat.
932,SdQsynrdEjalHmiZ9lK5dw,4/4/2023,1 star rating,Absolutely TERRIBLE! The staff is incredibly rude. Two of the men who work there came up to me and yelled at me while i was eating for absolutely no reason. They started yelling in my face and one even threatened to put his hands on me. They are extremely rude and unprofessional. I do NOT recommend the Bedford location. Absolutely terrible.
933,SdQsynrdEjalHmiZ9lK5dw,11/18/2021,4 star rating,Was in the area around lunch time and decided to get pizza to curb my hunger. Always heard of Joe's Pizza as I work by one in the city but just never had the chance to try it. We got a cheese slice and a mozzarella slice to try and they were both pretty good. The cheese slice was nice and hot and just came out of the oven while the mozzarella slice needed to be heated. Cheese slice has a good tang to the sauce that was used and cheese pull anyone? The cheese was stringy and so delicious. I got a pretty decent size slice as well so no complaints. The mozzarella slice have a sweeter sauce that Â I'd say I'm used to on a grandma pie. My husband likes it though. Overall not a bad spot for pizza when you're in the area.
934,SdQsynrdEjalHmiZ9lK5dw,10/24/2022,5 star rating,Wish they opened one closer to us! We got the white mushroom and spinach pizza as well as the supreme. The crust on the supreme was perfection-thin and crispy with lots of bubbles on the crust. The toppings were also equally delicious. Sauce to crust ratio was spot on. The white pizza however I feel the spinach could have been distributed more evenly so you don't just get one huge bite of spinach. But my fiancÃ© disagreed with me on that point and said he liked the big bites of spinach so we agreed to disagree on that point. The service is ok it's a pickup and takeout spot not alot of room for dine in. So I can't say that service really matters a ton but the guys were responsive and quick. It kind of tastes like secret pizza in Las Vegas but not as oily. Overall I am definitely going back if we are in the area.
935,SdQsynrdEjalHmiZ9lK5dw,2/13/2022,4 star rating,Went super late one night to grab a pie to go. Got a plain cheese pie and ate it in the car while it was still hot. Overall a good no frills cheesy slice with a classic NY thin crisp crust. The sauce was good if just a little salty. I do think there is better pizza for the price. I probably would get it if I'm by a location but wouln't go out of my way for it or have a craving for it.
936,SdQsynrdEjalHmiZ9lK5dw,1/28/2022,5 star rating,"Is it just me or is Joe's at Williamsburg better than the one at Washington Square? The crust is so much more crisp yet flavorful sauce, but that might be attributed to the Supreme slice I got. It was loaded with toppings! They have an outdoor seating area."
937,SdQsynrdEjalHmiZ9lK5dw,2/6/2022,2 star rating,"I was really looking forward to Joe's after hearing the hype and seeing the bustle around the corner, but the pizza was quite disappointing. While it was not actively repulsive by any means, it was quite bland and boring. I've had plenty of 99 cent pizza slices that were tastier than the slices here. There are some chairs outside for outdoors seating if you'd like, but it seems like most people get their fix on the go.It is conveniently located right by the Bedford L train stop and so I might give it another try if I'm in the area and craving pizza."

The bagel store in the same mini mall has decent hot and iced coffee for 1-2$. But you don't want run of the mill deli coffee! You want venti double shot skinny vanilla lattes! Which this Starbucks will make for you quickly and efficiently. I'm never in here during ""rush"" times, Â only weekends (there are some teenagers, but they by no means over run the place) and in the late morning or afternoon, Â the line moves quickly and is much shorter than other Starbucks I've waited in."
947,zcWxZaC7pnIVe2ON4uUEDw,12/17/2015,2 star rating,After learning more and more about their ingredients; I tend to steer clear of here unless I'm in a hurry or have limited options. Many of their items contain GMO's if not all. They need to step up the quality of the food items and prepared food if they're going to charge the prices they do. Why can't they serve organic options? Just pick up one of their salads and there's tons of ingredients that you can't pronounce.

Then when I got to the register, he asked me ""what'd you order?"".... Like I know the exact order info and stuff, this is my first time coming here; they're so delusional with their customers. Anyone would be annoyed in this situation, I had to go back to the kiosk to see what was the name of the smoothie I ACTUALLY wanted. I went back to the kiosk and it was super slow, buffering and at that point I realized he was just lazy, didn't wanna my order and wanted me to leave. So I did that! Thanks Panera, never supporting this lazy location again and telling all my friends/family to do the same. Moral of the story: if you don't wanna close, don't take closing shifts !"

Decent sized location with plenty of seating. Some of it up front and plenty in the back. Booths, tables and counter top seating are all here. You can do the online orders and pick ups here and you can also order via the kiosks to avoid the lines. The service is good here and it can get very busy depending on the time of the day. Especially in bad weather. The bathrooms were pretty clean as well which is always a plus. Parking is via the garage or street parking which there is but hard to find. The garage is a few bucks."

It's alright if you want to dine in, because if there's a problem with the order, you can fix it there. But I usually order delivery. Oh by the way this location is not very clean at the dining area. I spend a few minutes cleaning the table and seats each time I visit. The first few times I visited last year were great. But lately they've been completely running out of bread bowls... sucks because it IS Panera's signature dish but I substituted what I wanted for something else. Today I ordered my soups with bread bowls because they were finally in stock. The delivery came with the soups but not with bread bowls! It clearly said on the order and on the receipt that I ordered ""BB"" for bread bowl. They offered to refund me, but I wanted the rest of my order delivered since I already paid the delivery and tipped the staff. Delivery wasn't an option anymore. They again offered me a refund but I decided to drive there myself and pick up what I paid for. I've been fasting all day just to deal with this when it's time to eat. Disappointed. Will be ordering from a different location from now on."

It's crunchy, sweet and tangy! A must order. And if you've never had their tuna salad sandwich you are definitely missing out. It is always fresh and full of flavor."

One time during lunch, it was so packed that we waited for seats but not too long. People here are mindful and will leave once they finish their meal. This is a high traffic area Panera Bread.There is only one person at the cash register which I feel bad for especially when there is so many people waiting in line to place an order. There is a staff member that will ask if you want to use their machine and place order. Think they should put that person on the cash register. That why it's so slow here. The food is good and they call your name as well as give you a pager which vibrates to let you know when your food is ready.One drawback is the hot water for tea is not hot enough. Once hot water container is taken, it takes a while for another container to come out. I will stick with coffee for there are three types to select from."

My partner and I sat down in a table and waited for the food...1st complaint- when our pager went off my partner went to pick up our food and we were missing one item, when he asked were was the missing item the panera guy told him ""we don't have that anymore"" (that was unacceptable because he could have offered something else since it was already paid for- at the end my partner did get a different thing but because he requested, not because the panera guy offered.)2nd complaint- like I said our pager went off and our food was delivered to us at 10:01 PM, We didn't know they close at 10 o'clock so we started eating our food inside (we ordered a grilled cheese, bagel and 2 hot chocolates). Literally 3 minutes later the same Panera guy came up to us and said: guys we are already closed, I said already? And he replied: yes, we close at 10.I was upset at this point.Around 4 minutes later he came back and said the same thing. I got even angrier and told him:""We received our food 10:01pm!!! (And showed him the receipt)He said:"" It's ok, I'm not rushing you just letting you know because we gotta start cleaning up""I said:"" yeah but this the second time you tell us""He just walked away... we could not even finish our food and had to walk out with half our bread and the full hot chocolates""WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE."

It's a pretty good fried onion and the dipping sauce is a unique concoction that is identifiable only to Outback. It's the appetizer everyone comes here for and it's presentation is unmistakable as an Outback Steakhouse creation. The steaks are pretty good. They are not aged, and yes they are obviously frozen but they are also affordable. Where else can you get a Fillet Mignon for $23 ? The burgers are $12, they come with fries and the dynamic duo of fries and a burger are no more expensive than what you would pay at Wendy's or McDonald's for a Bacnonator or a Quarter Pounder. The quality of Outback's burger is okay, unlike the fast food counterparts mentioned above, the Outback burger's single patty is 8 ounces, and can be ordered rare or however you like. Everything else here besides the beef is not that great. The seared Tuna was okay but a bit dry. The coconut shrimp was nothing short of what you would get at a supermarket frozen food isle and the french fries lacked seasoning and were a bit bland. But for a budget place, this is the place."

I know that sounds dramatic but that's how terrible this experience was. It started out with the table smelling like a pet store. I assume it's from using a dirty and smelly mildew rag. Then we had a waiter who clearly hated his job. His lackluster personality did not make this terrible experience any better. When we ordered, your establishment was out of everything we tried ordering from baked potatoes to broccoli. We were understanding and changed our orders. Our food came, appetizers were normal and fine, we thought that was going to foreshadow a great dine in experience, despite our table smelling like a pet store. When the entrÃ©es came was when the real shenanigans started. The food was cold, and the quality of food has significantly downgraded; the french fries were different than usual, the chicken fingers were different than usual, and the salad looked like it came from a bag from Shop Rite that had been left out of the refrigerator, wilted and sad. My friend was picking hard chewy pieces out of the chicken fingers. We didn't get ranch with the Aussie fries, we had to request salt and pepper for the table as well as ask for our drinks to be refilled when they were empty. These could've been easy fixes except every time the waiter came back, it took him 8-10 minutes to return. We received our steaks cold, as if they have been sitting around. He forgot to put in two different peoples side orders and again, didn't return for long intervals as if they were waiting for the potatoes to grow from the ground. This doesn't seem to be the waiters problem but actually a management problem of the whole establishment. I can say I would never step foot in this location for the rest of my life, but still pondering if I should return to any Outback locations ever again. This place is better off condemned and has nothing to do with the COVID 19 pandemic. The restaurant from ""down under"" is actually down under.*I gave a 1 star rating because I had to in order to post this review."

When we finally got our food (which took almost 2 hours longer than the time we set our pickup for) arrived, we were missing a $3 drink we paid for and multiple sides that added up to about $6. The Blooming Onion was soggy, and the food was overall just not an enjoyable experience. Will not be returning to Outback again, and I wouldn't recommend it to you either."

Every single dish is basically perfect, no matter how deep on the menu you go, it seems.We came for dinner on our most recent visit and it was incredible. We got the bread/butter, potato pave, yellowfin tuna, leek toast with anchovies, grilled shrimp in calabrian chili butter, fried chicken, and then finished with their cheesecake and chocolate sorbet. I'd be extremely happy to order any of these again, but our very favorite was probably the leek toast, which was just extraordinary. (Really anything here with bread is a must, as we learned at our lunch visit as well.) Even the desserts were amazing -- both were about as good versions as you'll find of those dishes anywhere in the city.Can't wait to come back again."

I highly recommend all three! The ham and cheese is so flavorful and served on a hearty bread. The fluke and geoduck with lime juice is super refreshing!

However I definitely would recommend framing your visit as coming for wine and small bites -- it's definitely pricy if you want to eat dinner sized portions. I did love the service, and the wine recommendation by our server was delicious. Food wise, I would not recommend the clams -- there was double the shell for the number of clams we got and the clams were small. I would also not recommend the tuna, it was pretty simple and not stand out. I would recommend the bread (we ended up getting two orders even!), the beans (complex flavors) and the porkchops (you should know that there is a decent amount of fat on it)."
1002,FvCslLyo0SlDKI52bEDekQ,12/6/2022,5 star rating,"We walked in at about 8pm on a Sunday with no reservation and were so lucky to find that a table for two was available. This is an amazing place to explore food and wine. We had 6 dishes and 5 glasses of wine for about $100 each, after tax. That's a pretty amazing deal given the quality of everything! The service was also warm and professional. I think the sommelier liked that we asked questions and were excited to try new things. They have a great selection of wines. Whatever you order will be high quality. I was surprised to find myself preferring a new, experimental local wine over a traditional Chablis. It's so nice to be able to compare them side by side.The dishes are thoughtfully crafted. For example, we started with the house bread - simple, but as heavenly as fresh bread and quality butter can be. We then ordered the clams, which came with a few pieces of rye bread for dipping in the sauce. It was delicious! We had a little bit of the house bread left over, and we tried dipping that in the sauce. Not as good. It was so fun to discover how the rye flavor can be used. Â Lastly, the vibe is great. Soft warm lighting, cozy tables. Not too big, so it's not too loud. And a great playlist, which I would expect nothing less given the connections to LCD Soundsystems."
1003,FvCslLyo0SlDKI52bEDekQ,5/25/2022,5 star rating,"I enjoyed a standout dinner at The Four Horsemen last weekend, well worth the trouble of snagging a reservation.We came for the natural wine selections, but left enamored with the food (and service). Don't get me wrong: the wine list was indeed abundant, and we thoroughly enjoyed our glasses of orange (mine was very light and floral) and bottle of red, but the small plates that we sampled left the biggest impression on us.Our server was absolutely fantastic. He was beyond spot on with his recommendations and his ability to elevate our experience with details big and small. We were, for example, prepared to just order from the menu for our bottle of wine, but he talked through our preferences with us and brought out some of his own ideas based on the conversation, which was a fun way to explore the restaurant's offerings. He also recommended the:-snap pea salad (mint, hazlenuts, ricotta salata), which turned out to be our favorite dish of the night and maybe one of my favorite salads ever. Fun is had here with the textures and different flavor profiles. I described it in my hastily jotted-down notes as ""transcendent""... maybe a little over-the-top to describe a salad, but it was actually kind of transcendent.We also ordered:-yellowfin tuna (yuzu kosho, tonnato, smoked dulse): melt-in-your-mouth heaven. Tastes kind of creamy and tangy, which - having looked it up - I realized is thanks to the tonnato sauce.-roasted dover sole (beech mushrooms, horseradish, lemon butter): The lightly sweet, addictive little mushrooms really made this fish dish shine.-a tart-like dessert which featured a delicious crust and fruit but I can't recall additional details.With dessert, my partner also ordered a lovely vermouth (Amaro dell'Etna) to taste. In addition, as we were celebrating a birthday, our server very thoughtfully brought out a couple of additional after-dinner drink samples, including a pear brandy.I"

I went with two friends and we ordered the crispy potato pavÃ©, yellowfin tuna, warm house bread, fried pig's ear salad, grilled sun shrimp, and leek ricotta toast. I would go back just for the pavÃ© (I could eat the creme fraiche alone), and the house bread was freshly baked and everything you could possibly want in a sourdough bread. Those were definitely the standouts, but I was also delightfully surprised by the fried pig's ear salad because it's not a dish I'd normally choose myself. It came at the suggestion from our waiter (whose name I'm blanking on, but we were there on a Saturday evening), who was an absolute gem. He not only gave us stellar recommendations but was also very generous with wine tastings. We sadly had to leave before we could try dessert, but the bread pudding looked phenomenal.

Â I just wish one day they work on renovating the place along with all the wires hanging out instead of patching up the walls with layers of paint."

Even with the new place that just opened that gets all the hype (ahem tiger sugar) i still think i would come back to this place more. They have quality tea drinks and also have a brown sugar drink. It's not all about one drink. I've tried their fresh taro drink. Delicious if you actually like taro the vegetable. They're pricier but i know they care about quality. For their brown sugar drink they use organic valley omega 3 milk. Which is expensive!There's never a wait or a line and they deliver via seamless!

I had their brown sugar pearl latte ($5.5) while my friend got their taro specialty that's currently geing promoted ($6.5). My drink was warm even with the ice, and tasted like slimy brown sugar + milk. While I'm aware that these are included in the name, I expected it to be somewhat tastier. While my friend's taro drink was slightly better, neither of the drinks were worth the outrageous prices. I tried to finish the bubble tea, but couldn't even drink half of it before tossing it away. Also, my friend tried to customize the sweetness level and amount of ice for her drink, but both requests were denied."

I wanted to order a signature black sugar drink but I am not a ""sweet"" person, so I asked them for no sugar and no ice. The staff told me that they can't make it that way and he recommended me the Brown Sugar Pearl Black Tea Latte which is not as sweet as Brown Sugar Pearl Latte, but still have to have ice (I don't know why). When I got the drink, it is all sugar at the bottom. I shook it before drinking, but the first sip is still toooooo sweet! Maybe I didn't do it right?! Â Or it's what it supposed to be?! The pearl is sweet but not as chewy as what I expected. The ice really ruin everything. When it melt, the whole drink tastes like water! Really not happy about it! I take stars away for the pearl and the ice."

When I got there, there was actually a line out the door - there is some seating inside but the place itself wasn't that spacious with all the people standing around and waiting for their drinks. I went with their Brown Sugar Â Pearl Latte; everything about this drink is pre-set so you cannot customize it at all. I went with a large and the total came out to be around $6.50 which I thought was pretty expensive for a bubble tea. Overall, the taste itself was a big let down. I did not like their tapioca, they were too small and too soft. The drink itself just tasted like watered down milk tea (I could have gotten better milk tea else where for a cheaper price). I did not mind the sweetness (but I am the type of person to normally get regular sweetness in all my drinks) but the drink itself wasn't good and I def regretted getting a large. I don't see myself coming back anytime in the near future as it was way too expensive for mediocre bubble tea."

But I am always up for new boba spots! As it just opened, lines are pretty long during post-work hours. The YiFang fruit tea, even at 25% sugar, was too sweet for me. I'm a sugar-less coffee / 25% sugar for boba type of person. Maybe fruit tea just isn't for me and I need to go back to my standard green / oolong tea?"

I gave this place two stars for their ambiance and their cream mousse topping that was on point. However, there are just many other places by the area that I would recommend over this spot."

With the Alley coming to St Marks soon and Tiger Sugar in Queens. I looked forward to trying Yi Fang. Perhaps Tiger Sugar set the bar too high, but I didn't enjoy the Brown Sugar Tea Latte with Tapioca. The tapioca is mushy by design. It won't solidify even if you leave the drink sitting for an hour or two. The downside to this is the boba adds and thin film texture into the beverage. These tiny bubbles are easier to consume and tastier but this additional film ruins the texture of the beverage. It feels too slimy."

From spoiling ice cream to them scraping the stuff I didn't ask for my burger off and giving it back to me. If I were you I'd go to the other one on white plains rd. This isn't it. UPDATE !! 22 days later. Went back to the McDonald's for a simple McChicken with NO MAYO as usual. I'm not gonna even talk about the fries but why is it they can't get a simple order correct !!

Waiters were extremely rude and seemed like they did not want to be there at all. When we asked for a little more time before ordering, he basically rolled his eyes and walked away.. The food itself was mediocre at best. The price point did not justify it.. Drinks were pricier than other places in ktown. The worst part was that while we were still eating, they started to take away our plates (we had only been seated for an hour at that point). I ordered an army stew and they took it away when there was still more than half of the food left. They didn't even bother to ask if we were still working on it. It just seemed like they wanted to kick us out. My whole party agreed that we would not be coming back.. I would not recommend this place to anyone."

Hooks for belongings along the walls and QR codes to view the menu. What stood out to me was the exceptional staff here; masked, polite, and multiple waiters for all the tables rather than just 1. They gave the table a free seaweed with clam soup for the table to start. We ordered chicken wings (2 flavors) and then the army stew. Both were delicious but I wouldn't say it was exceptional. Since we dined in on a Tuesday, their daily special was $9.99 for their signature cocktails (compared to the usual $16.25!). I liked how I didn't feel rushed out when we were done. Really recommend!"

The bonus perk of this place was finding a Korean restaurant that would take reservations for a Friday evening. I used this very evening to introduce Korean food to one of my foodie friends, mainly spicy food. We stuck with the staple wintry dish, Korean army stew. The broth was delicious and rich with flavors. The noodles was coated with the right amounts of cheese and to give that ever oh-so-satisfying pull. Just look at that gloss! Â Plenty of proteins, rice cakes, tofu, and jalapeÃ±o peppers included to make it a colorful fiesta. We ordered wings as you can't have a Korean cuisine night without their staple Korean fried chicken: soy garlic and sweet-n-spicy flavors. I was intently waiting for her reaction and she said it was most crunchy sauce fest wings she had. Mission accomplished. We both also appreciated how attentive our host and waiter was that night and they picked up on how I wanted the dinner to be a success. We also felt safe being in this restaurant as it provided plenty of spacing between the tables and it wasn't packed to give us anxiety about Covid standards. Everything was spot on and I can always rely on this ktown selection for me and my friends."

Located just outside the main street of ktown in what may be considered a basement, it may be easily overlooked, but the inside is very rustic and lively, making it great for groups who are looking for a night with yummy food and drinks. I love their army stew and cheesy rice cakes - they may come off a bit pricey but the portion size is quite big and good for sharing. I've also had their jokbal and fried chicken which are pretty tasty too. They accidentally charged us for the complimentary steamed egg, but upon bringing it to their attention, our server immediately corrected it, apologizing countless times. Everyone seemed very friendly and were happy to answer any questions. Overall, a solid spot with ample seating that probably beats a majority of the other restaurants located more in the heart of ktown."

Unfortunately we've had significantly better experiences for a lower price elsewhere.We ordered:- Boiled pork slices with radish salad & cabbage wraps ($32)- Yuzu makgeolli ($29)For the pork dish, we got a surprisingly small amount of overcooked pork, accompanied by 3 presumably canned oysters buried deep underneath a mountain of thin-cut radish. Of course, we ran out of the pork very quickly and found ourselves picking at the leftover radish.The makgeolli was extremely foamy (as you can tell from the picture), to the point where we couldn't taste much of anything for the first few sips of every glass we poured. Only by the time we got to the bottom of the bottle did we start seeing clear liquids (which shows it somehow wasn't mixed properly despite being shaken to produce so much foam). Perhaps we were supposed to shake it every time before pouring, but certainly with all the foam that was already there, I'm doubtful that shaking it would have made it a much better experience.I added one extra star for the complimentary steamed egg they provided, which was certainly a welcome and appreciated gesture."

Sadly, I feel like the quality of the dishes really went down. I specifically came back to get the corn cheese pancake again. The last time I had it, it was crispy and so delicious. However this time around, it was basically a mozzarella cheese pizza. There was just TOO much cheese on it for it to be enjoyable. And the crust wasn't crispy at all. We got the chapaguri since my friends were fans of Parasite. However they used pork instead of beef like in the movie. The noodles were cooked to a nice Al dente. It was not worth it for the price point, considering this is literally packaged instant noodles. My friend got the smoothie and it was $15. It was nothing special and incredibly overpriced for a nonalcoholic drink."

Let me just say....everything you've heard about these cakes are true. They live up to their accolades. Not everyone can bake a great chocolate cake but this is the best (besides mine) lol that I've had. It's so moist and fluffy and not too sweet. As a matter of fact, all of the cakes have the right amount of sweetness where it's not overwhelming. The Banana Nutella is more of a dense cake (almost like banana bread) and equally as tasty. The Strawberry Shortcake I feel is my favorite with that delicious frosting...if you've ever had a Strawberry Shortcake ice-cream bar....that's what it reminds me of. If you have a sweet tooth like myself, you have to try their cakes. The slices are big enough to share. Enjoy!"

Aside from that, I have been several times before to this shop. The s'mores bar is tasty, but everything else I have tried has been disappointing. The cakes are extremely dry and the frosting has little flavor and is more like biting into cold butter. I got the s'mores birthday cake for my birthday and it was awful. It was thick layers of dry, overcooked, stale cake with very little frosting/filling to balance. The message on the cake looked like it was written by a child, and it was smudged. It was the only time in my life I have ever thrown out birthday cake and not finished it. Overall, there are plenty of better bakeries in the area with tastier treats and ethical business practices, so I doubt I'll be back here."

This is the only place really open past 10pm besides the local bodegas and a Dunkin' Donuts two blocks up. Don't get me wrong, the service is terrible for breakfast, lunch, dinner and beyond. I have had better experiences going to the dirty bodegas late at night and have gotten faster, better and cleaner service. I would rather a hero any day from the local bodega than mess with that crappy McD's. The service is always extremely slow. You never get service with a smile and the employees just don't care! I can run that place with my eyes closed by myself and give customers a better experience. Being a waiter myself I can not imagine having to work with any of those employees. Since I have been living in this area for two years I have seen employees come and go. I hope it's because the manager is firing these people once he/she sees how terrible they are. At the end of the day it comes down to management though, and the managers need to do a better job and ""manage"" to get that store together. One more thing before I finish this. The last time I went to this location a girl who works there let out a loud belch while she was bagging up a couple of Big Macs for a customer and then laughed about it.

She was very attentive. The rude employee handed me my food, with out utensils, napkins, or condiments. I feel that she did it on purpose. I had to get up everytime to get these items which she had the nastiest face on when I asked for it. If you did your job and checked your attitude your day would go a lot better. Honestly. Fire that girl and promote Shayna."

They can never get an order right,or you get cold food or not to your order. If you say no pickles you get double. The Service sucks the bathroom is always nasty.from the managers to the cleaners this place needs a full revamp with real employees. People that take pride in doing a job and getting PAID for it. Â Not a bunch of rude nasty disrespectful young people that have no manners or respect for anyone they should not be Â working in customer service. Dang people it ain't that hard i have done it. If you give service with a smile that's usually what you get back, a smiling happy customer. McDonald's should be ashamed of themselves allowing this type of service coming from one of their branches. Â And this is Canarsie Brooklyn. When I go to bay ridge and such areas you get clean bathrooms service with a smile condiments,napkins and fresh hot food. But not here. Your lucky if you get your order right even if it's cold lmaoSMH!!! But they got an A on their window. How long ago was that? when they first reopened their doors probably. I would like to see what they would get now. Cause if that place got an A someone is Â getting paid under the table."

I am to embarrassed to even check-in to this place on yelp. I have been living in Canarsie for two years and there isn't many food places to eat at in walking distant, especially late night. This is the only place really open past 10pm besides the local bodegas and a Dunkin' Donuts two blocks up. Don't get me wrong, the service is terrible for breakfast, lunch, dinner and beyond. I have had better experiences going to the dirty bodegas late at night and have gotten faster, better and cleaner service. I would rather a hero any day from the local bodega than mess with that crappy McD's. The service is always extremely slow. You never get service with a smile and the employees just don't care! I can run that place with my eyes closed by myself and give customers a better experience. Being a waiter myself I can not imagine having to work with any of those employees. Since I have been living in this area for two years I have seen employees come and go. I hope it's because the manager is firing these people once he/she sees how terrible they are. At the end of the day it comes down to management though, and the managers need to do a better job and ""manage"" to get that store together. One more thing before I finish this. The last time I went to this location a girl who works there let out a loud belch while she was bagging up a couple of Big Macs for a customer and then laughed about it. Had that order been mines I would have demanded a refund. That just about sums it all up right there. Beware!!!"

But I, the vegetarian and the one paying, really did not like my Â Pad Kee-Mao with Vegetarian Duck, the vegetarian duck was very good as were the few veggies - peppers and onions, but the noodles were terrible. This tasted like the really cheap Chow Mein I used to get in North Philadelphia, when I was in architecture school, low quality and very greasy. I give it one star - so we settled on two stars.Sad, because a few times in the last year, before Covid times, I got the Pad Kee-Mao and it was really clean and fresh tasting. I ate the mock duck and the veggies and tossed out the junk noodles. I will never order from here again sadly."

There wasn't much flavor to the Khao Soi which was disappointing. We ordered other stir fry dishes that were good though. It had many fillers like onions and pepper which was nice. I think the best part of the dinner was the ambience and the fried cream cheese that we got.

I also remember their water glasses to be extremely small which was a negative. Their photobooth was super cute but the text yourself the photo feature never worker!!!

One was garlic rice and the other was a kale pesto brown rice.There were a bunch of interesting sauces, but the roasted peppers and the salsa verde were top notch.All in all if you ignore the oil the meats sit in, the flavor is great and all very fresh.

Â Other than a few very select items, not seeing why I'd take business from the mom & pop Latin restaurants that remind me of being back in their home countries when La Vecina didn't bring that Colombian awesomeness I was looking for.Inside the arepa:Splurged and worked my way through (sampling a little of everything fresh when it arrived):- Calentado w/chorizo (breakfast bowl with their red bean & cilantro rice): perfectly fine. Â You shouldn't expect spicy chorizo from a Colombian joint. Â Seems like they take the traditional approach of cooking it in water then letting the sausages continue to cook in their own fat. Â A quick grill after that would definitely help bring out some flavor. Â The eggs were fine. Â Didn't care for the rice as it was more grainy than fluffy, and I didn't like the herb/spice balance. Â It was a hearty portion to match the borderline hefty price. Â But bland overall. Â Needed the sauces.- Tres Leches: nice size piece to meet the higher than usual price for this very simple cake. Â But the top half of the cake was stale, which isn't easy since it's soaked in a ton of milk. Â Disappointing.- Elote (charred corn): one of the few select items I'm still thinking about. Â Absolutely bomb and would order again in a heartbeat.- Yuca Croquettes: they were fine. Â I don't think delivery serves them well. Â You need these fresh out of the fryer to get a shot at some ooey gooey cheesiness before the yucca sucks up all the cheesy fat. Â But they repurposed really well to make huevos y patatas a few days later.- Sweet corn arepa (w/pickled onions, crispy kale, cotija, crispy shrimp): the positive is that you're getting a ton of food in what is more a mini bowl than a proper arepa. Â Which is good, since this thing was just north of $10. Â But I was disappointed since every arepa I saw pictured was in tradition ""sandwich"" style, wrapped well so everything held together and you could get everything in each bite. This was a very thin arepa on the btm of the container with everything piled up. Â And the arepa didn't hold shape when I tried to make a complete bite, which could be due to how thin the arepa was. Â Arepa flavor was nice. Â Really big and perfectly fried shrimp. Â But the crispy kale was more greasy and chewy than crispy (seemed like the oil wasn't hot enough, and they didn't pat the grease off well enough). Â If you wrap your head around mini bowl, it would be a solid buy (arguably a steal with all that shrimp). Â Did not a great arepa make.- Latin Bowl (w/garlic rice, carne asada, black beans, pickled onions, cotija, pernil): That garlic rice is phenom. Â And the carne asada bomb. Â I'd order those two with the black beans and some cotija again in a heartbeat. Â But the pernil? Â Flavor was fine. Â But there is much better in the area. Â And it was a bit dry. Â Black beans fine. Â Nothing special. Â For value (it was $20-ish)? Â For around that same price point you can get a similar dish with 3-4 meats + more rice and beans at area competitors and all the components are flavorful with nothing dried out...- Salsa rosada, salsa verde, y aji colombiano: all were good. Â Not sure I'd pay for the rosada again, as I can make better in my kitchen. Â But the verde was awesome and aji colombiano nice.Gonna think about waiting a bit and possibly give them a try again...but, for now, not a place I can recommend to anyone who is in the know about this kind of cuisine."
1126,VWvsDCwE04KBugMFPKYGNg,4/10/2022,5 star rating,"Think of this spot as a swanky version of Polos Mario... The vibe is more upscale, you get a similar (OK maybe sleeker) menu, with subtle refinement. Â I stopped by craving chicharron, but asked if there was an alternative to the Bandeja Paisa, which is a plateful of food that's usually big enough to feed a family of a million. Â The waitress recommended ordering ala carte... so I went with chicharron, red beans and rice and arepa. Â  There was no skimping on the volume, and left feeling full and satisfied. Â I also appreciated that the chicharron was crisp (but not dry) and not over salted. Â The arepa was clearly home made. Â Would probably have paid less than $25.00 if I ordered a platter rather than ala carte (also had two diet cokes), but was ok with it as I was able to relax and enjoy the food and BGM (Looks like they were on an Oscar D'Leon kick.) Â  Will definitely return."

Pro-tip: Ask for their slices/pies ""well done"" for that extra crispy crust, as theirs can be soft and doughy sometimes."

Sat there for close to 30 mins without having anyone come try to take our order. There were 3 other tables in the restaurant that were all there before us so it was not busy. Plenty of staff to help but nobody actually does anything. I wound up walking out because the service was awful. The first time I've ever done something like that! I can see from other recent reviews that service here has been a consistent issue. I gave 2 stars only because this was the first time I've had a real bad experience in this otherwise mediocre restaurant."

I keep thinking, maybe it was just this time? ..Clearly it has been every single time. The staff are still sweet and but their food isn't which is upsetting.The last time I've ordered was about two weeks ago for delivery. The woman on the phone told me 45 minutes for the food to be delivered. An hour and 10 minutes later, I had to call back and asked if the delivery driver was ok? She told me he should be within 5 minutes to destination. 20 minutes later, the delivery guy shows up with our food. An hour an 30 minutes later. The food was surprising still warm, maybe there was an issue but I was in hopes of a phone call informing me about their tardiness.Overall disappointed because of their food but the delivery time was the icing on the cake."

If you aren't ready and ask for a min or two they don't show up for 5-10 mins unless flagged. I had a instance where the food took over 30 mins. I wouldn't have been pissed if it was super busy. But the funny thing is when we got there, there was only one table before us. But afterwards few tables walked in and they got their food waaaaay before us. They don't communicate with you about what's happening. And honestly you are better off just ordering entrees because they don't know what an appetizer means cause when you order apps they come after your entree and if you tell them you want your apps first, it takes them about 30 mins to bring your entree afterwards. I understand the idea of leaving time in between apps and entree but it should not be to a point where I feel hungry all over again. All in all if you wanna go eat here make sure to have a snack before hand cause the wait is gonna be long and cancel the rest of the days plan. But the food is soooo amazing. But what's the point of food being so good if I am super upset the whole time I am waiting for it.ONLY GIVING 5 star for food, service I would give a -100 if possible.And in the 3-4 trips I have made there they have screwed up one item for sure."

This was one of the few places open that still delivered so I ordered without hesitation.While waiting for the order to be delivered, I decided to read some yelp reviews in order to kill some time. With each shitty review I read of this place, my anxiety grew. One reviewer literally wrote that they'd take a shit at the doorstep of this place. By the time I read these reviews, however, it was too late to call off the order. At this point I actually considered turning off all the televisions and hiding my noisy eight month old in the back of the apartment to create the effect that no one's home, basically taking the Jehovah's Witness approach with the Mexican delivery man and hoping he'd go away with whatever bullshit he brought to my door. After further introspection, however, I decided to man up and face my decision to blindly order from this place. When the delivery man got here, w/in a very reasonable Â amount of time, I gave him 10 dollars, which covered the price of the burrito and the tip. Â When I sat down at the table, I said a prayer (not the blessing, but a prayer) in the hopes that all would be well. Must have worked because when I bit in, it tasted great! Steak was seasoned correctly, texture of the meat was perfect, veggies were good, and burrito was wrapped tight. Totally worth the order to me. Â All that being said, my advice to you is if you want to order from this place, order from it and form your own opinion. You may be pleasantly surprised."

The initial image of it should have destroyed my appetite but I was starving. It was low quality meat with so much gristle. And it had red pepper, onions and... Broccoli (WTF). To top it off... It had a really thin layer of some white melted cheese on top of it that resembled something I don't even want to mention. This was all floating in some murky liquid that tasted like the sweat/juice that comes out of meat when you begin cooking it. After a couple bites I threw everything away..

I wish they were open for lunch- it might be a better situation - it's hard to get a reservation. It's a small place. There's a ton of amazing hype about this place. It's small. Noise level is high - starter crispy polenta. Amazing and truly crispy surrounded in an incredible sauce - Matty Guns - pasta with amazing sausage and meatballs in a vodka sauce. This dish was incredible - only thing was that the vodka sauce was so rich that in 4 bites I was stuffed !!- chicken cutlet parm- again an amazing red sauce.

It really was an excellent experience. Meals are family style size so going with more people gives everyone a good chance to try the many delicious plates. The pasta is perfectly Al dente and every bite was absolutely packed full of flavor. We sat at the bar and had the most attentive server. Cannot wait to return and enjoy as cocktail and more delicious food. Definitely you must go and give them a try you surely will not be disappointed.

And he's also so sweet. The staff is just adorable and so funny. Thomas is coming out to personally greet his patrons, ask how everyone is doing and if they're enjoying everything. If the food wasn't amazing I'd give them 5 stars off of service ALONE. But it is. It's amazing. The meatballs are made with rib eye and filet. When I tell you they are cotton candy soft I mean it. It's served with ricotta and mozz, and I don't even like ricotta but I ate it all and I enjoyed it. The Caesar salad is perfectly crisp, not refrigerated, not overdressed, and the dressing doesn't have that nasty fish taste that a lot of Caesar dressings have. It was also the biggest salad I've ever had. My man basically licked the plate clean lol. They only had two specials last night. My man got the short ribs with the special ""super spicy"" sauce. When he asked how spicy it is, Thomas came out to tell him it's made to order and he can have it however he likes. He told the chef to do his thing and boy did he. I had vodka rigatoni. Let me tell you when I have pasta, I want it to have almost a bit of a crunch to it. This pasta was perfectly Al dente, the sauce - I mean do I really have to tell you ? Look at it. My cousin had the white clam linguini. Again, just look at it. I don't have to tell you. I don't drink alcohol, but my man and my cousin told the waiter they both wanted a fruity vodka drink, their exact words were ""give us the same thing but different"" and he did exactly that lol. They were the same color and everything but different flavors (one was orange cranberry the other was pineapple cranberry). For dessert she also had an espresso martini, which she said she really enjoyed, and we split a tartufo. Despite the fact that I starved myself all day in preparation for this meal, the portions are just ungodly. By the time the pasta came We were honestly so stuffed, we had to take it to go. A thought to consider - family style All in all. I knew this place would be everything I dreamed of. I just had to try it for myself, and in conclusion I wish Thomas great health and success in everything he does. He deserves it."

I want to be fair to say that this place is a decent bar, it has a nice outside space, it is great for the summer months, and they have events for sports games and trivia, and I believe they even have small music shows in the back. I do say that this bar is worth a visit if you like a selection of beers and casual drinking. I just think they lack a little bit of variety."

1183,OS27j6CbRx7Cq6Fg8mS-KA,5/20/2018,1 star rating,"Not a great customer service experience. The owner/manager got upset when we asked why my husbands tab said ""f*ck you, (random Indian name)"" on a post-it note. (My husband is Indian). All we did was ask why/ how said post-it note ended up on his tab and the manager quickly got offended / defensive, denying it and saying it was impossible (but the photo proves otherwise). He then said ""you should leave"". The bartender, Tony, however, was kind and apologetic. The manager needs to take a class on diplomatic, rational client service. He didn't have great command on his reactions/ emotions. Asking a customer to leave for simply asking questions around a legitimate problem/question is poor business behavior at best and shitty human living at worst. Photo of our tab with the racial slur of a post-it note attached"

Close to being heaven on earth, Pine Box keeps the inside at a toasty temperature, always encouraging long stay and comfortable sits. Â Showcasing their typical Bushwick location, pine box offers live music and bathrooms covered in graffiti.

The bar is large and the staff friendly. Coat check is available by the door, Im unsure if there is a fee. Patrons ranged from eccentric hipsters to eclectic grunge, I noticed a ton of combat boots and men in tunics lol.I attended a Vegan Shopup event here. It was held in a small backroom, maximum occupancy around 30, comfortably. Theres a small stage in the corner and it seems like a cool spot to catch a show by local performers. Six vendor tables were placed into this room for the Vegan breakfast cookoff event, which left little to no space for people to move about. My mom and I would retrieve our samples and then exit the room to eat our vegan treats. It was tight in there and only got tighter as the time progressed so we didn't stay long. One of the judges, Adam Sobel of The Cinnamon Snail came in with a wallaby in a baby sling! How crazy is that?! Talk about making an entrance lol  In light of this event there were specials on Bloody Mary's and mimosas, awesome! The most amazing Chai tea by Chai Mookie was sold at this event as well. It was the best Chai I'd ever had, spicy and delicious! Pinebox is also a pet friendly spot which I'm not a fan of. I saw most patrons holding their animals but I'd rather not have a dog sitting next to me at the bar as I sip on my cocktail."

This spot was relatively uncrowded at 6:30pm on a Friday evening, and my friend and I grabbed a spot at the bar. The first awesome thing about this spot is the venue: huge room with a long bar AND patio seating, too! Something I've been missing since I moved to New York is spacious buildings and high ceilings - you can actually spread out and breathe a little in Pine Box. The second awesome thing is the rotating $4 happy hour special - where else can you find that deal around here?Something I wasn't able to see was the back room where performances are held - this spot hosts live music shows and events, so, I guess I'll just have to come back :)."

I did not realize this because I had given my card and asked for the check and then only after my card was processed and my bill was brought over did I notice that. I think it should be stated in bold on the menu that they would prefer cash payments or that an additional fee is incurred by using credit card, which is the most common type of payment nowadays."

The aÃ§aÃ­ bowl was my favorite but the soup I got was also soooo yummy, it was freezing out so quite nice. A pretty small place but super cozy and kind staff!"
1237,rQjn0Fus4YUSu_SW2FU-MA,9/2/2017,5 star rating,"Fun spot to grab brunch with friends. We came on a Monday morning and it was pretty quiet, which meant lots of 1-on-1 time with our lovely waitress Breckyn. The menu is full of unique offerings - my fav was the MATCHA PANCAKES. The breakfast sandwich was simple yet tasty, but made even better by adding bacon. You can get a huge side of bacon for only $2.50! Score! Back to the matcha pancakes... bright green, topped with blueberries, blue cornflowers and crushed nuts. The stack was not strongly matcha flavored, and quite large, but somehow I managed to eat every last bite. My boyfriend got his usual espresso and I ordered a large cup of rose peppercorn lemonade. (All proceeds of the rose lemonade go to Syrian refugees - YAY!) Service was quick but we didn't feel rushed. The decorations are bright and fun, and remind me of a coastal cafe in Southern California. Great break from the hustle and bustle of surrounding Chinatown. Be sure to take a pit stop in the bathroom (tiny but super colorful). If I'm ever in the area again, I'll certainly be back for another delicious and nutritious meal. Great value for the price, friendly service and worth your time! One of our favorite meals during our trip to NYC!"

Fun place to come for a date or to catch up with a friend.First time I went we split the salmon salad toast and the encino man. I thought the encino man was all right. I was really into the salmon salad toast; the combination of flavors worked really well. Had to order it again the second time I came, as well as one of the acai bowls that I've heard a lot about. We got the berry acai and it was a refreshing complement to the toast. Out of curiosity, we tried two of their chilled beverages, the pH tonic and the umeboshi shiso seltzer. They were interesting, but not for me, so I probably won't do that again. I'll stick to the earl grey I ordered the first time around; I asked for milk and honey along with it and it came in a cute setup.We also checked out their deli / market across the street, which was fun to walk around."
1239,rQjn0Fus4YUSu_SW2FU-MA,7/2/2019,4 star rating,"Four of us was at Dimes for brunch. The place looks quite small (and it probably is) but has more seating than it looks. The place has not overcrowded but has a nice amount of customers to make it lively. I'd come back for another brunch with friends.I had Dos Tacos and the juice of the day - juice was a nice blend of 4-5 kinds of fruits, but it's only a small amount so the price of $6 is a bit too much. Tacos were great, which included fluffy eggs, mild salsa with mango and zucchini pieces that made the dish more interesting and palatable."
1240,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,12/23/2020,1 star rating,I ordered from this restaurant today and was soooooooo disappointed in the delivery service as well as the food! The bubble tea was horrible and the delivery person was rude and unprofessional! Since when are you (driver) allowed to force a customer to come and fetch the food! Absolutely nuts! DO NOT ORDER OR EAT HERE.....EVERRRRRRR!!!!!
1241,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,3/3/2021,5 star rating,We love their veggie sushi rolls! Always so delicious and the delivery is quick. The miso soup always arrives still hot which is amazing. My only complaint is I wish they had more vegetarian roll options because the ones that they do offer are delicious.
1242,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,1/18/2021,4 star rating,I've only ever order from here around lunch time and its been the best food in Williamsburg by far. I see the other reviews but I think it comes back to time of day and what you order. I en d up ordering lunch specials and more when I'm in the mood to quick cook sushi.
1243,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,1/24/2021,5 star rating,"Surprisingly so their salmon has been consistently fresh. Due to covid, the quality of sushi at restaurants have been extremely disappointing in NYC. It has gotten to the point where my husband and I stopped ordering ""exotic"" and more expensive pieces of fish due to the lack of consistency. We decided to just seek out fish with a higher turnover at restaurants and the salmon at Ikura Sushi is impeccable!"

I've lived in this area for 4yrs and am bummed that I'm just now finding this place because I've eaten some unsatisfying sushi...The sushi is Â very tasty (tried the Sweet 16 and a few of the basic rolls) and all the apps were delicious too. Try it out!"
1245,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,5/14/2020,5 star rating,Great! Ordered mid-pandemic. They said it would be an hour and I got my order in around 30 minutes. Solid to go sushi. Made another rough day much better. Completely fresh and generous/expected in terms of portions. Dragon roll was yummy. Sashimi/sushi combo perfectly executed. Nice and easy to deal with phone order. Trying to be honest here. Hope everyone has a similar experience!
1246,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,6/27/2019,5 star rating,"My favorite sushi delivery in Williamsburg for years now. Affordable, always FRESH, friendly, and so fast I barely have time to put pants on before they get to my door.Noted: not a sit-down dining place (fluorescent lights, etc the one time I visited), but in my 10 years in this neighborhood, I now have these folks on speed-dial because they are consistently great.It's too bad they are getting bad reviews from Seamless orders. Maybe that's a new thing for them. I always call directly and they take good care of people like that."

Ordering from here for the first time, I was excited to try something new- I was also starving ! The order was supposed to take 40 min and it took 90 min. At the 55 min mark, I called and they said ""5 more minutes"" so I waited. When the food finally came, the ""crunchy"" parts were soggy and the avocado was mushy. 2 of our 3 sushi rolls were way too salty. It did not taste fresh and my stomach felt a little off that night. Instead of offering me any refund or discount for my next order the manager said ""well now you know our service and food aren't good so you don't have to order from here anymore"". Â I won't be. You shouldn't either."

The hot and sour soup was pretty nice too. None of their food was out of the world. But their service is splendid, price is reasonable, and location is awesome.

Chili wontons: Flavorful and plump pork enfolded in tender wonton wrappers and served with a spicy and savory soup base that wasn't too oil. Â Very good.3. Braised beef shank and turnip casserole: Soooo flavorful and savory. Â The jus is delicious and the perfect base for the flavorful and well-marinated tender and fatty beef shank and turnip. Â I think that I ate an extra bowl of rice because I wanted to polish off every last drop. Â They also serve complimentary orange slices and the requisite fortune cookies at the end. Â  I only had the fortune cookies since I was too stuffed for the orange slices. Â Seriously - I think that I ate half of the casserole, half of the wontons, and 3/4 of the pork shoulder - which is likely 2-2.5 lbs of delicious meat PLUS a bowl of rice.

But the broth and the fish were really great in flavor.

This is our go-to Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood. The dining-in is great: food is fresh, waiters/waitresses are accommodating, etc. The szechuan food is on-point and very authentic (highly recommend the chili pig intestines and xiao long bao, which is our fav). My most favorite aspect of the food is that it is not greasy, which can be a problem with Chinese dishes. The food is unapologetically spicy but not your standard spiciness -- it's what we called ""malay"" and there is a numbing, burning sensation to it that fills your soul.As for the take out/ordering out aspect of the restaurant, I agree with past reviews: it needs A LOT of improvement. Delivery tends to exceed the promised time on Seamless or whatever app you use. Moreover, whoever is the Cantonese woman that sits behind the counter is inhospitably RUDE . I almost stopped coming to the restaurant because of her.. She's the most cantankerous person on 2nd Ave, and, if she's part of management, it's probably time to step down because it's clear she hates her job. However, if you're dining in, the waiters/waitresses are 500x more personable and the saving grace of the restaurant (not to mention the food).So, would I return? Only if I am dining in. I would avoid this place like the plague if I was to order delivery/takeout."

Â Don't expect to be pampered by the service but you come here for the actual authentic food. Â It's the only place in Midtown that serves true-to-flavor Sichuan cuisine. Â I am giving 5 stars for the food. Â Service and ambiance are more like a 2 but again - I judge on actual dishes!Some highlights:1. Braised pork shoulder with shitake and bok choy: This was delish with tender, flavorful pork shoulder in a spicy and savory jus. Â The portion is huge but I ended up eating 75% of it...yeah..2. Chili wontons: Flavorful and plump pork enfolded in tender wonton wrappers and served with a spicy and savory soup base that wasn't too oil. Â Very good.3. Braised beef shank and turnip casserole: Soooo flavorful and savory. Â The jus is delicious and the perfect base for the flavorful and well-marinated tender and fatty beef shank and turnip. Â I think that I ate an extra bowl of rice because I wanted to polish off every last drop. Â They also serve complimentary orange slices and the requisite fortune cookies at the end. Â  I only had the fortune cookies since I was too stuffed for the orange slices. Â Seriously - I think that I ate half of the casserole, half of the wontons, and 3/4 of the pork shoulder - which is likely 2-2.5 lbs of delicious meat PLUS a bowl of rice. Â The dishes are so good that you will want to finish everything."

It's low key, almost a hole in the wall, but serves pretty authentic Chinese food. We usually get the Kung Pao chicken here along with sautÃ©ed greens in fresh garlic(Chinese broccoli or bak choy) but this time we decided to venture out a bit and got the -steamed fish in green chili broth which tasted amazing and was big on sichuan chili flavor which actually got a but overpowering after a few bites. But the broth and the fish were really great in flavor. And you can ask them to reduce the amount of sichuan peppers if you want.We also ordered a side of sautÃ©ed bak choy with fresh garlic which was yummy as always.The meal ends with a complimentary serving of fresh orange slices and fortune cookies which is the perfect way to end this meal."

1289,fuLGTn6H_BLEa1ahGGzebQ,1/6/2018,4 star rating,"We come here on a weekly or at least bi-monthly basis; and host a lot of family dinners here. This is our go-to Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood. The dining-in is great: food is fresh, waiters/waitresses are accommodating, etc. The szechuan food is on-point and very authentic (highly recommend the chili pig intestines and xiao long bao, which is our fav). My most favorite aspect of the food is that it is not greasy, which can be a problem with Chinese dishes. The food is unapologetically spicy but not your standard spiciness -- it's what we called ""malay"" and there is a numbing, burning sensation to it that fills your soul.As for the take out/ordering out aspect of the restaurant, I agree with past reviews: it needs A LOT of improvement. Delivery tends to exceed the promised time on Seamless or whatever app you use. Moreover, whoever is the Cantonese woman that sits behind the counter is inhospitably RUDE . I almost stopped coming to the restaurant because of her.. She's the most cantankerous person on 2nd Ave, and, if she's part of management, it's probably time to step down because it's clear she hates her job. However, if you're dining in, the waiters/waitresses are 500x more personable and the saving grace of the restaurant (not to mention the food).So, would I return? Only if I am dining in. I would avoid this place like the plague if I was to order delivery/takeout."

My friend celebrated his birthday at Chadwick's given the convenient location and the accommodation of a large party. Some of us arrived early and we started at the bar with some happy hour drinks.After being seated, some of us ordered our own thing and some of us shared family style. The appetizers like the seafood tower and octopus was average at most, nothing too memorable.Then the entrees and sides hit the table, that was when everything went down. All of the meat, including the Porterhouse Steak and Lamb Chops were so bland and tasteless. The steak had no juicy beef taste to it at all. Salt couldn't revive it. My particular steak didn't come out the way I asked for it. And that's a huge issue in my books. I usually do not prefer my steak anything past medium rare. I made a mistake of telling the busser and he was so rude about it. The server asked us how everything was towards the end, and we told him how it was. He was disappointed to hear that we did not enjoy our meal and wished we told him earlier. I wasn't going to wait longer for different or new food. We spent a hefty amount of money here on wine, drinks, shots, food, desserts etc. and none of it was compensated for a terrible meal and overcooked rubber steak. It's not over yet, later on, I found out no one really loved their food either and it wasn't just me."

Our one complaint was the maitre'd who was rude and inconsiderate. He chastised us for not leaving the bar as soon as he informed us our table was ready. Then, after dinner, he came to our table to tell us we had to leave and had the busboy remove everything from the table. Â Very rude after we spent ver $400 for dinner!!!!"

More of a diner feel inside the dining room. Booth was very old and had no support. Dining room was packed when we arrived. Delicious Caesar salad. Only 3 shrimp in the shrimp cocktail for $21 -- could round out with one more shrimp not to be so meager. My filet mignon that I order medium rare arrived basically raw inside and it took about 15-20 minutes or so while my husband ate and I waited for my meal. Quality of meat was mediocre and the chicken paillard fry needed salt.

It was very loud in the dining room and the servers kept banging into my chair without apologizing. We had a Mediterranean salad to start which was good but served with an Italian dressing rather than the oil and vinegar it stated on the menu. The steak itself was tender and flavorful, however the outside was overly grilled and the flavor of the crust took away from the steak itself. The asparagus did not taste too fresh and the onion ring on top was soggy so I didn't bother eating. The mash on the bottom was very good. Dessert was good, however it was only partly warm is some areas and cold in others so I wasn't sure if it was to be served warm or cold."

One friend arrived at the door wearing a tank top and pants, and he was told that his outfit was too revealing. The bouncers first claimed that nobody could wear tank tops, regardless of gender. They also (incorrectly) sated that no one inside was wearing a tank top. However, the female friends in the group who were also wearing tank tops, myself being one of them, were let in without hesitation. My other friend offered his jacket to him, and the bouncers still would not let him in. When he brought to the attention of the bouncers that many other women in Arlene's were also wearing tank tops, the bouncer responded saying that the tank top rule was ""different for girls"" and that ""to compare himself to a woman is absolutely crazy."" My two queer friends were targeted by these double standards that were clearly intended to keep a queer-presenting person out of Arlene's. It was such a disgusting display of homophobia and exclusion. This served as an incredibly disappointing and sad reminder of the discrimination my queer friends continue to face in non-queer designated spaces."

Groovy vibe, friendly and conversational staff, good musical performances, and affordable drink prices. There are two levels to the bar. Though the bottom level bar is frequently used for private parties, when it is open it's as though you're in an entirely different bar. Both levels play different music and have their own bartenders. There's always an interesting mix of people. You're able to order outside food to the bar since they don't have a kitchen, which is a huge plus. Only wish the bathrooms were bigger.

The foam and the latte were both very good. They have a nice subtle flavor. I like that they accept Apple Pay. I've heard birch is better so I likely will not return to Gregory's. My latte was $6.86.

Â If you are going to be chain in the Mecca of a place with Mexican food, you have to bring your A game.This restaurant makes the area look more commercial which I like. It seems that the street lights are now brighter around the area, which may be a coincidence, but the restaurant creates another fast food destination on each of the three corners of that particular street.Unfortunately, the steak the day I ate there was dry. My burrito bowl was ok, but was not outstanding.

Â I usually order my standard default drink with herbal jelly as my childhood favorite dessert. Â This Gong Cha sits inside Fulton Center as a kiosk rather than a independent storefront. Â Customers can grab their boba to go in the passage of one's travels on the subway to your destination. Â I find the herbal jelly rather stale and harden which tastes like rubber. Â I order honey green tea at less honey embedded, however, it contains a lot of sugar. Â It tasted entirely too sweet. Â What would former NYC Mayor Bloomberg think about excessive sugary drinks made and sold? Horrified and utter dismay. Â Gong Cha is a big disappointment, but I did give it the o' college try without prejudice. Â To each their own as one goes your way and I go my way. Â Customers can choose the amount of ice desired. Â Price for one medium honey green tea is reasonable of $4.25 plus one topping of herbal jelly $.50. Â Nevertheless, the staff is attentive and courteous.I prefer my favorite bubble tea shop Hui Tea in Chinatown, Manhattan, NY on Canal Street which they do it right with the herbal jelly, the minimal sugar level and the overall freshness plus taste.

Also, I love that you can adjust the sweetness. Best of all, they have the best boba! The boba tastes like a little squishy bubble and then the chewiness is just right. Pearl Milk tea and Taro were the flavors we tried. Loved them both! The prices are comparable, maybe 50 cents more than other places. The service is fast and the screens are helpful."

1343,R2mT2LVQRnstpDNkcgx-oQ,3/7/2019,3 star rating,"So I've ordered from this place multiple times. Other reviewers aren't laying when they say it's a hit or miss. I always order the oxtails. Sometimes I get them and they are so damn good I eat a large order by myself. However, sometimes, like today, I get them and I gotta throw them out and just eat the rice. It's sad they can't be more consistent. But it's sooo disappointing when you're looking forward to a good meal and get some mess. I never complain because that's just not my style. But they seem to be consistently giving me bad oxtail lately. Might have to stop ordering"

The delivery guy is an active substance user (IDK this but I am assuming) he has filthy hands, the food is TERRIBLE and the service? Horrendous. I ordered food, it was incorrect - it took them 2.5 hours and 7 phone calls to REPLACE my original order. I requested a refund because the wait time was so lengthy and when the delivery guy returned, he was so obnoxious claiming that I ate some of the food I was returning. Overall - I do NOT recommend this place, please order elsewhere and save your coins/headache."

I even got the blueberry pudding puff as my dessert and it tasted like a delicious donut - the perfect topper to my meal. I would definitely come back here with a group of friends or even on a brunch date! Only thing is that this place doesn't have a liquor license yet so you can only get the basics like mimosa, Bellini etc."

All of our guests loved the food and drinks, and the place was setup perfectly for our little party! I could not have picked a better place for our special event and am so grateful for White Radish's hospitality! We are already regulars here and will continue to be :) It felt especially special to host friends from all over (from Staten Island, Manhattan, NJ, and PA!) and be able to proudly share one of our favorite local Forest Hills places with them."

The food is farm to table and most of the items we ordered were delicious. Only the charred octopus was below average. No taste and the texture was a little soft. The fries were fried perfectly. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. My go to entree here is always the seafood pasta. The outdoor area was nice. We sat outside in the enclosure and it was nicely ventilated and breezy. Today's weather was perfect so no too many empty tables. When we arrived, only two tables left and it was quickly filled. They take reservations if you would like to call ahead of time. Lunch with tax and tip totaled to around $123 including three drinks. Definitely not cheap according to my husband but definitely yummy for the most part."

For entrees we had the White Radish Burger and Duck 2 ways. No issues with the food at all and our server was friendly and attentive. I removed 1 star from their rating because the prices are a bit high in my opinion. The total tab for food, drinks and tip came out to almost $190. That's enough to buy 2 weeks of groceries. at least for me. Unfortunately the prices will most likely keep me from coming back anytime soon."

I have to say she probably comes here once a week. So I decided to try it with her. I can't believe I'm finally writing this review. I think I've been here maybe like at least 10 times. I don't even know why I don't have more pictures. I've been here on the weekend during brunch as well as for dinner. I have to say the ambiance is very nice for date night. It is a fairly small restaurant so be prepared to be seated pretty close to others, which I don't mind, but other might. Even coming here for brunch we were seated very quickly with no wait time. They do offer indoor seating as well as outdoor seating. Our server was amazing and just very attentive to our needs. They do have a very nice drink menu and they have drink specials as well. Their brunch and regular menu is very good. I can't even begin to tell you how good the food is. My sister comes here regularly and she ordered the salmon, she is used to getting it with no ""spicy"" ingredients. This particular time, I think the chef added a new sauce that was spicy and my sister has a medical condition where she can't eat spicy food. The server was very accommodating and took the dish back promptly. He didn't make her feel like she was being annoying and apologized. We were very happy with everything. I go back here regularly so if you're in the area I recommend you stop by and check it out. You will not be disappointed!"

Nothing to write home to. With that said, I'd come back to try the dinner menu next time. Friend said the short rib ravioli is good."

I ordered a custom panini with grilled chicken, cheese, avocado and spinach. The bread they use must not fresh, because it has a really strange stale flavor. The grilled chicken doesn't seem fresh either - maybe it's artificial or frozen and then thawed - either way, the texture is unpleasant. I really wanted to like this place since it's open so late and has convenient in location - but it's definitely not worth coming here if you want a sandwich.

Would give them five stars for that!This morning however, I opted for a large mighty leaf tea. To be honest, the cup sleeves they provide are practically useless. It's so thin, it doesn't help at all. But that's not what I'm writing this review for. I left the cafe and was walking to the subway when all of a sudden the hot water exploded inside the cup and threw the lid off. VERY hot water burned my hand! It's been an hour and my hand is still red and hurting. I don't know how that could happen, I am absolutely sure I wasn't tilting my cup and did not accidentally spill it.So to be safe, make sure they don't fill the cup with very hot water up to the brim when you get a hot beverage.

I usually get the Threesome Crepe (nutella, white chocolate, peanut butter and graham cookies), but I've also ordered the S'mores crepe (Nutella, reese's peanut butter, marshmallow and graham cookies). If you like the ingredients in the Threesome crepe, make sure you try it -- my mouth is watering just writing this review. That's how good they are! I've also tried their savory crepe (the caprese with mozzarella, tomato and basil), but I usually stick with the Threesome and S'more -- what can I say, I have a sweet tooth!The crepes are $9.00 each, but they are HUGE and very, very filling. They definitely don't scrimp on the ingredients and will top it with powdered sugar and cinnamon, if you prefer. Â The inside is very, very small (no room to eat in, but that's why there is ""To Go"" in their name), although they do have seating outside. They also have some great Greek items (yogurt and Fredo Espresso, which I'm now obsessed over after a trip to Greece this summer!).The only downside is they are cash only. Bummer because I rarely have cash on me. I felt like I had to knock off 1 star for that - how many vendors with a storefront are cash only these days?Payment method aside, I love Cafe to Go!!"

Their coffee is also really great. I also love that they're open late. The only down side is that the place is teeny tiny but they have a couple of stools on the inside. They also have limited seating with tables outside for a nice summer day or night. And it's cash only! But don't worry there's a chase right around the corner."

Dr. Oz said that Greek (Turkish) coffee is good for you. So drink up and enjoy the crepes made the right way.

We tried Furikake fries (I think that's what the seasoning is called, but it's a purple salt seasoning) and wasabi fries! Both were amazing, but the wasabi fries are to die for! It was sweet and salty, a perfect combination. It didn't taste much like wasabi, but you will not be disappointed! The furikake fries were also delicious, but it wasn't as amazing as the wasabi fries. I personally don't even like wasabi, but I was in love with the wasabi fries.I would've had a meal of wasabi fries over my spicy ramen any day! In addition to the food, the service was absolutely amazing. We were actively check up on and the waiter was very friendly, and fun to talk to! This place is amazing!!

The inside has a laid back and trendy ambiance that's perfect for an Izakaya. We ordered a Yuzu sake carafe and a variety of dishes for the table to share (yakiniku, skewers, karaage, and yakisoba). Every single dish we ordered was fantastic! All the meats were moist and cooked to perfection. The sauces were balanced flavors with excellent use of spicy and sweet notes. The Yuzu sake was sour and not too sweet, making it a great balance to the fried foods. After trying several izakayas in the city, this one is by far my favorite!On top of excellent food, the service was friendly and efficient. I would note that most of the tables are small (seating 2-4), so this wouldn't be the best choice for a large group. But for small groups, highly recommend making a visit!"

Â My favorite out of the three was the karaage, as I believe they specialize in small plates and appetizers over entrees. The chicken was moist, flavorful and came with a great dipping sauce. I enjoyed my skewer don too (came with your choice of skewers, so I chose chicken, pork, and beef). The pork one came out a bit burnt and charred, the chicken was a bit underseasoned, but the beef was the best of the 3.I was also looking forward to trying their house special ""Juraku Nipon Rice Lager"" but they did not have that available so I settled for a Sapporo.

The artichoke gratin is good, short ribs, we essentially love the whole menu. The russian potato salad is also a large tapas! Quite large, but delicious. Oh and the head-on shrimp! AMAZING. Please always keep the squid ribbon noodles on the menu. Until I get ahold of the recipe hahaThe wait staff is super friendly and attentive about removing plates. The drink menu is small, a lot of wine, which we personally dont drink, and their cocktails are all mainly gin based from what I recall. But all in all, we love this place and will come back every time we are in NY!"

I'm sure all that heat is not good for the cold cuts that are sitting out, especially the tuna salad. The portions seem very skimpy and, for the second time, I was given bread that was dried out and it didn't feel, or taste, fresh at all. When I got home, I had to transfer the sandwich contents to plain white bread and throw out the Subway bread. What was in a 6"" sub hardly even covered a regular slice of bread. I wouldn't come back here again."

I'll start with the negatives.Like the other people mentioned before, it is very hot inside, and the space is not properly used.For Subway, the food seems to come out quickly and the location is good. For the times I've been there, their opening and closing times seem accurate. Honestly, I would rate the Subway two stars because their food doesn't seem that good.HOWEVER,Nathans is much better. I would rate Nathans four stars because the food is very cheap and good. The only bad thing about Nathans is that it takes some time to get your food because they make it fresh for you.Overall, I'll give it three stars. You shouldn't expect amazing things from Subway, and the prices from Nathans surprised me. Plus, I feel like the current rating is WAY too low.I did have one bad experience at Subway, but it was related to the Bubble Tea and not really Subway. There were like 4 people in line for Subway and I was there for Bubble Tea, but they didn't come to me for a long time and went to customers who came in after me.

1438,jk1czy1OiwpEBlWxM8wDlw,4/3/2022,5 star rating,"Wandered around NYC for a bit and came across this comedy club. The place is everything you expect out of a comedy club. We were greeted at the door and told the show was starting at 8pm. Ifs a 2 hour show. They only do cash which is weird considering the times but maybe that's what makes sense for them. Twenty dollar entry fee and then a two item per person requirement once inside. It doesn't have to be alcoholic drinks they had a few snack options and refreshments. If you're looking for 5 star food service go to a restaurant, this is a comedy show. With that said the drinks I ordered were delicious I tried the Kamikazes md the Blood of the Dragon. The servers were also very hard working and made sure everyone had what they needed. It's nice to just sit back and enjoy words without fear of being judged or "" smacked "" ;) also! Shout out to all the comedians especially David Macintosh !! Had us laughing non stop his whole bit."

1440,jk1czy1OiwpEBlWxM8wDlw,3/18/2019,4 star rating,We were looking for a comedy show to see in NYC and I stumbled upon this place on Groupon... what a bargain $10 for 2 tickets. I had just paid over $60 for 2 tickets at another club a few weeks ago... granted it was a headliner there but still... huge difference. I was honestly a little skeptical since the tickets were so cheap but we were pleasantly surprised because it was a great show! We arrived around 7:30 for the 8:00 show and it was pretty empty so we got a table for 2 in the second row. By showtime the place filled up. As with most comedy clubs they have a 2 item minimum per person so I tried one of their creamsicle frozen mock tails $10 and a slice of cheesecake $10. Service was very friendly and attentive. This club had 4 featured comedians as opposed to a headliner and they were all entertaining as well as the host was great too... I'd have to say our favorite performer of the night was Kareem Green he was absolutely hilarious! All in all it was a fun night and I would definitely return!

You need to put ""cash only"" on your website. Drinks were absolutely disgusting. Over priced, weak and this place was complete trash. Only reason it gets one star is for the effort of the comedians. If you want people to come back then offer drinks at a reasonable price or get a new bartender. Worst drinks I've ever had. Â I don't know how you're letting this slide and trying to pass as a legitimate business. If you want a good comedy venue. Go to the Grisly Pear in the west village. Never coming back to this place."
1442,jk1czy1OiwpEBlWxM8wDlw,5/17/2021,3 star rating,Came by here on a Monday night for the comedy show. They featured a variety of stand up comedians and their routines. Service was decent - we got our order mid way through the show. There's a $20/two item minimum. Tucked away in the upper east side.
1443,jk1czy1OiwpEBlWxM8wDlw,12/11/2018,5 star rating,"Bottom line: if you like stand up, you'll have a great time. Even saw a bunch of known comedians!Gluten line: drinks only, food is simple and totally not safe. Long line: as a fan of stand up, I had a blast here. Some of the comedians I've even seen before so it was a real treat seeing them perform in person. Do understand that even if you get discounted tickets, they make their money with a 2 drink minimum, which is strictly enforced. Even given that the price per person isn't terrible for what you get, and I'd personally return. As others mentioned, most comedians will roast, so be prepared, specially if you sit really close."
1444,jk1czy1OiwpEBlWxM8wDlw,1/31/2019,4 star rating,"This club definitely goes up on a Tuesday. My friend and I arrived around 7:30 pm after a hearty dinner nearby. The doors weren't quite open as it seemed there was a class that was wrapping up, but we amused ourselves with the photographs on the wall of the numerous famous comedians who had graced the halls of the famed Comic Strip Live.We were one of the first people there (get there early!) so we snagged a seat in the second row. In my experience, the front row is mercilessly cajoled -- in the best way possible of course. The host was great, he made the usual rounds and touched on everyone who was there that night. It was refreshing to see a performance that was to interactive, it definitely made the night so much more fun. The laughs throughout the night from the set attested to that at the very least. We decided on this show because my friend and I are both strong fans of TJ Miller, who performed an hour into the show -- he was phenomenal.From a cursory look on their website, they pull a lot of big names in comedy and tickets are very reasonably priced. We were also given two free tickets to another show since we stayed to watch up and comers do a set (they were just as good as the scheduled performers!). Definitely make reservations before you go and stay for the whole time! One star off because of the 2 drink minimum for outrageously priced drinks. I didn't order anything but towards the end the waiter asked me if I'd like to be charged two sodas (the cheapest drink and was very nice about it) and I obliged. I will say, it's better to come on the weekend so that there is no Wednesday morning guilt about drinking on a Tuesday night before class."

And 1 order of bacon, eggs & French fries, when I come to pay $27.80. Â I was SHOCKED. $27.80? I ask her why was this priced so high. She was rude and said it was the extra bacon. I've been coming here for years and never paid this much for 2 plates. I ask if she can refund me for the bacon because it was too much, I believe they were over charging me. She begins to argue saying it's not her job to inform me of the price. She kept telling me she doesn't want to speak to me but keeps talking OVER me and belittling me. She then decides to tell a waitress to take off the bacon from the order. She comes back with my stuff. When I'm in the car I realize they took bacon off of every order and the side order. 4 slices of bacon: $5. I went back in and she gets even nastier. I think she thinks she's better than me and the manager was disgusting informing me and my sister to take off the bacon from my food and serve it to someone else is an issue they have to deal with, last time I checked that's unsanitary and unnecessary to say. So many years and memories here to finally realize that these people don't care about your business or loyalty. Take your money to IHOP, Atlantic diner, Classic diner or even the Corner store deli.

Our food was nice but the waiter was so rude - he didn't welcome us, couldn't find our booking even though it didn't really matter as there was only 2 tables in there and then as we came to pay he wrote down his OWN tip on the receipt. I know it's very common to tip in America but, his service was not deserving of a tip and to then write down your own tip of what he thinks he deserves was bizarre. As we went to leave he stood in front of us and said 'where's my tip?' and we said that our service wasn't good and that we don't have too' and then he said 'you have to tip in New York' - which YOU don't if you feel like it's not deserving it's not illegal not to tip!!!! He was so intimidating that I got a 10 dollar bill from my purse and put it down and just left as quickly as we could. I didn't catch his name but he should not be working with the general public and clearly doesn't understand what a tip actually means...It's for the customer to determine based on the service received not the other way around. A shame as we enjoyed the food but shall not be going back due to his bizarre intimidating manner and how he made us feel. Not good."

Their first location opened in Nolita years ago. They offer brunch and dinner options with a fairly casual/chill vibe. Their Nolita location also has a juice shop next door to the restaurant (not sure if that's still a thing anymore so maybe double check).I would recommend this place if you're looking for a satiating meal that is also not too heavy. I think their heaviest item on the menu might be the Impossible burger (comes with sauce and cheese). Their pasta dishes are made with zucchini noodles. Most recently I had their kale ceasar, butchers burger, and artichoke quesadilla.Kale Caesar - 3/5, presentation looks 100% but the salad itself lacks flavor, comes with croutons and fried onions but neither of those are seasoned, vegan parm also had no flavorButcher's Burger - 3/5, bean patty so slightly healthier than their other burger option, comes w cheese and grilled onionsArtichoke Quesadilla - 3.5/5, also lacked flavor, flour tortilla with vegan cheese and artichokes, comes with salsa (which honestly just felt like unsalted purÃ©ed tomato) and spicy mayo"

I was unable to eat most of the meal and I did inform the server but unfortunately was still billed for the burger ($18 before tax), even with the rotten food. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is that the server was very friendly and because I appreciate vegan + vegetarian restaurants, but rotten food isn't it, my friends. You do at least hope when your food is off that you have options to have it taken off your bill, but that wasn't my experience :("

The chai drizzle gave it a kind of grainy texture. The Butcher Burger was much better! Definitely more worth it, especially because it's vegetarian. I really enjoyed the chipotle mayo on it too. The service wasn't the greatest. It took them a while to even seat us, but not because it was busy, just because no one greeted us.

He was always so attentive with refilling our drinks, bringing us new cutlery between courses, when I tell you we did not have to ask for a single thing I mean it!Food and Drinks: I had the Hibiscus & Pomegranate mixer which was so delicious and refreshing to drink. Friends got a variety of other menu items and everyone opted for a second. For food we split a vodka pie and a plain pizza which were both to die for. The pizza is so thin and crunchy if I didn't get a main meal I would have eaten the entire thing!! I ordered the aglio olio peperocino which was delicious. It was VERY spicy which they did alert but do beware! everyone got a different pasta dish and there was not one single complaint among the group.

This was a perfect amount and the pies were large so we still had about 3/4th of a pie to take home. I would definitely say that one pie can easily be shared by 3 people .... 2 if you are hungry. The pepperoni pizza was covered in thin pieces of pepperoni which we really enjoyed. My favorite pie was the white pizza which came with hot honey and sausage.

For mains we had the roast chicken, the strip steak, the rib eye, and the tomahawk. The best steak was definitely the rib eye, and my favorite cut of steak is normally the strip. The char on the tomahawk was very intense, the strip was a bit too overcooked, but the rib eye was absolutely delicious. On the side we got the whipped potatoes, hash brown, mushrooms, and brussels sprouts. All of them were fantastic and come in portions big enough to share. For dessert we had the chocolate peach bread pudding. This was absolutely divine. The ice cream was perfectly melty and worked so well with the decadent warm bread pudding. I couldn't tell there were peaches in there but nonetheless it was still great. Overall the atmosphere is great, the food is above average for a NYC steakhouse, but everything is a bit pricey"

During our entire meal he never asked us if everything was okay, and again acted bothered when I had to request fresh pepper for my pasta. I would have tolerated average tasting Italian food, paying $45 per bottle for an $8 California Cabernet, and a horrible tasting rice pudding that they ruined by drenching it with anisette had my party of 6 been treated well but unfortunately we were not. There are way too many good Italian restaurants in Dyker/Bay Ridge to go back here."

Â She ate at Tommaso's on Christmas Eve and had the feast of the 7 fishes. Â During the show, Tommaso (Thomas Verdillo) sang opera---which is what he sometimes does for his customers (but, alas, not when we were there). Â It struck me as the type of Italian restaurant that we like---an old school red sauce place. Â We grew up in the Northeast, taking such places for granted---that is until we moved to the DC Metro area.So...I got on hopstop.com and printed up directions to Tommaso's using our hotel as a starting point. Â It's pretty straightforward --- take the D train to 18th Avenue and walk about 1 mile. Â There is a bus you could take from the 18th Avenue station, if you prefer.We got to the place around 5:30 p.m. on a Friday night. Â  Tommaso himself greeted us and had a waiter seat us. Â  This waiter ended up being our waiter and sadly, he is one of the reasons we can't give this place a full 5 stars. Â The waiter was sullen and gave off an aura of being put up on. Â For example, the minute we were seated, he asked what we wanted to drink. Â We hadn't looked at the drinks menu. Â My husband chose Chianti and told the waiter to give me a bit of time to decide. Â I was leaning towards getting a soft drink when my husband convinced me to get a whiskey sour on the rocks.The place wasn't very busy at all in the main dining room. Â However, there was a private party going on in another room. Â Our waiter wasn't working that room but still he took his time getting to us to take our order. Â He wasn't rude or nasty---but he did need to improve his attitude.We chose the 3 course menu which was $25/person. Â For my first course (appetizer) I chose zucchini fritti and my husband chose pasta e fagioli. Â The zucchini fritti was just okay---I have had far better, thus another reason for not going for 5 stars. Â My husband really enjoyed his pasta e fagioli. Â It had lots of stock in it and I felt it was almost like having a whole meal. Â This was a tasty soup---just like home made.For my second course, I chose lasagna della Mama while my husband chose ravioli and meatballs. Â The lasagna was very tasty. Â I noticed that it didn't have ground beef in it rather it had shredded beef. Â My husband liked his ravioli and meatballs. Â The meatballs were small and neither of our portions were overly huge.While we were eating our main course, Tommaso came by to ask how I liked his mother's lasagna. Â I told him that I was enjoying it and commented on how it was different than any lasagna I ever had due to the shredded beef. Â He told me that ground beef was the Sicilian way while shredded beef was the Neapolitan way. Â He told us that in years past, women would cook up a large quantity of meat and would use it in different recipies so nothing went to waste. Â Also, at one time he put sausage in his lasagna but customers found that to be odd so he stopped doing Â that.For our third course, I chose Italian cheesecake while my husband chose an apple tart. Â These were the 2 desserts that Tommaso recommended. Â  He told us that he didn't like traditional Italian cheesecake so he came up with his own version. Â He made it less dry and more lemony flavored. Â The end result is a very tasty but not overly rich cheesecake. Â The apple tart came with a marscapone sauce which added a tart flavor to counteract the sweetness. Â Again, this, too, was tasty.We left feeling full but not ready to explode. Â This is a popular neighborhood joint as we noticed some regular customers came in and Tommaso addressed them by name. Â Even though it was our first time dining here, Tommaso made us feel welcome. Â As we left, he told us to visit again. Â We most certainly will!"

The family photos in the bathroom are so cute. You feel very much at home here and my mom would have loved the live music.The food is old school and some dishes could use some new schooling. Nice bread w/ housemade pesto and a good arancini start the service. There is a $27 prix fixe which has plenty of choices for appetizers and entrees. I went with the stuffed artichoke which they didn't have so I changed to baked clams which were standard. For my main I went with lasagna which was quite dissapointing. Overcoooked pasta with cheese tasting like Polly-O not delicate and felt like not a lot of thought went into this dish which can be such a treat. The dessert of Italian cheesecake dusted with flour was good. Sad & shocking that this is the last Italian left restaurant in this area where there was once so many memorable ones.

They even helped me dig around for my dumb aunt's ring that she thought she left there. (Spoiler alert: It was in her own home the entire time. I hope they forgive me.)

I had had a very long day, I'm talking 12+ hours of work, so by the time I made it back to my hotel I couldn't imagine going out for dinner. I posted up and checked Yelp for delivery options. Mexican food sounded good, so I decided to give Fatty Daddy a shot. I opted for the Grilled Chicken Quesadilla, Chips and Guacamole, and Babe's Rice and Beans with Cheese. My delivery was on time, and my food was hot when it arrived. As far as flavor, I thought everything was ok. Nothing was bad, but this definitely wasn't my favorite Mexican takeout experience.I think this experience with Fatty Daddy was likely my one and only."
1547,bMju8cdz4RdJVoPvbWQqSQ,4/26/2018,4 star rating,"I spend a fair amount of time at bars on Smith Street. Mostly because (1) I live right off Smith Street, and (2) I like to drink alcohol.Fatty Daddy is conveniently located directly between the bars I spend my time and my home where I unfortunately do not have hot and tasty burritos waiting for me. Now I can't prove that Fatty Daddy scouted me out before opening their second location right here, but if my suspicions are correct, it was a brilliant business plan...because when I am stumbling home from a bar at an embarrassingly early hour, chances are I will need to shovel something into my fat face.Fatty Daddy provides the fatty, cheesy, unhealthily loaded and greasy gutbomb I need in either burrito or quesadilla form, and they are extremely efficient. When they are on their game, not only can you be walking out their door with your burrito in under 10 minutes (that's if you didn't have the drunken foresight to order ahead of time as you leave the bar), but they will put your sour cream and guac inside the quesadilla itself, which is really just a more efficient way to get all this fat into daddy's mouth.Plus, if you (just a for-instance here) want to hide the fact that you stuffed an entire burrito into your face from your wife, you can probably eat it on the walk home...but not if you have to apply guacamole and sour cream to your food as you go. ____________Unrelated thought: I would like to propose we give beans a new nickname. The""musical fruit"" moniker is outdated; let's call them the ""thing that makes it smell like things have died inside me."""

The place certainly does not have the selection of its more famous neighbor Â but if you just want a better,chewier, heftier, crispier bagel with some simple toppings - this is it.

Â The pancakes (listed as flavored) were not flavored at all. Again, not seasoned, and not fluffy like pancakes should be. Mushroom/spinach quesadilla was mostly cheese, with no seasoning.

It's never too packed, which is perfect for me (since I hate crowds and loud groups. And yes, I know this makes me sounds like I'm 80 years old but I'm okay with that).

This place had an advantage over every other Â coffee bar in the area, Â you could get cold brew at any hour, Â no matter what the season.So, it is with a heavy heart that I must declare TROOST a dead destination.

We dropped in after a long evening in manhattan to grab a drink and check out the space. It's super cozy and has a good amount of seating. The staff at the bar were super friendly and nice. We checked out the back patio and I was so impressed by how beautiful it is! Kind of reminded me of Urth Cafe over on the west coast but of course with Brooklyn's charm. There was tons of quaint seating with beautiful lighting and seating for either small groups or larger parties. We enjoyed our drinks (noticed the drink menu is extensive and definitely cheaper than other places) and were happy to learn they still served food. I had the manchego tomato sandwich while he had the brisket and both were delicious! Good portion sizes, top notch ingredients, and beautifully presented.I've been craving a place like this since I first moved to NYC 4 years ago. Something quaint, good quality, friendly service, open late, and with few crowds. Troost makes me think I may have finally found it!"

There were two other tables with two persons also. SIX people in total in the restaurant. Every single thing we ordered was incorrect. I got my appetizer 25 minutes AFTER my meal arrived. And my meal arrived before my boyfriend even received his soup or before they decided to bring our drinks. I didn't even know who my server bc two different people were taking our orders and bringing us only portions of our meal. I asked four times for chopsticks. My boyfriend asked for teriyaki sauce, he got garlic sauce. I ordered Kobe beef appetizer, it was completely overdone and I didn't even get sauce (and of course as I said, it arrived almost a half hour after I got my meal). When I asked for the sauce to my kobe beef, the guy looked at me like I had four heads. He repeated the question ""sauce?"" three times before I said ""Yea, the sauce that comes with Kobe beef appetizer"" and he just walked away. He came back with the correct sauce but by then I was already too annoyed at the entire situation that there was no way he was going to salvage my meal. But that's okay because he didn't even try. The other person I identified as our partial server came back to ask if we needed anything else. We asked for the check. Took another ten minutes.Major letdown after the food and service that we used to receive."

1615,iQZYOzNB7b-vTF806dlbYA,10/11/2019,5 star rating,"Yes! Another bubble tea shop option in the up and coming LIC neighborhood! With not a lot of tea shops here, Yi Fang is definitely a winner. Located right near the Court Square stop of the E/M and even G/7 train, Yi Fang is truly a life saver when you don't have access to Flushing or Elmhurst. Mind you, the price range is quite higher than what I'd pay normally, but it's expected here in the LIC area where food is priced out for the demographic. Yi Fang has more healthier options in terms of tea flavors; it's also great when you can customize the sugar and ice level when needed. Although the flavors are not traditional like almond or honeydew, they do have milk tea, brown sugar, taro and regular tea leaf flavors for instance. Service is quick and I've never had a bad experience with the quality. I actually find it the best in LIC.Open late.Accepts cash and card, including ApplePay.Seats available.Drink up!"

YiFang is our go to boba chain and our favorite drink to order is the Mango Pomelo Sago. YiFang shops are franchised so the quality is usually pretty on par with one another nationwide. This particular shop however disappointed us, the mango drink tasted nothing like mango but sugar water. The topping was soggy, not chewy at all. This one was a miss for us!"

They only make their milk teas out of whole milk, which my body will not tolerate.The decor here is really cute and minimal. There a few tables to the side and small standing bar on the other side. There are a bunch of people working making drinks and 1 person taking orders. Because of the whole milk situation, I ordered the YiFang fruit tea. It was already $5.25 for the tea and I added jelly for an additional $0.50. Very expensive for tea. It was very delicious. It had slices of orange and apple in it. I don't think I would come here again even though I loved the tea. It's not very convenient for me and the price is little high for me."
1619,iQZYOzNB7b-vTF806dlbYA,7/3/2020,3 star rating,"Oh Yi Fang, how I love you, but how you disappoint me. Living in LIC, there are only a couple options if you want bubble tea if you don't want to pay for delivery from Flushing / Astoria / Brooklyn (aka you can choose between yi fang and moge tee, though a kung fu tea should be opening up soon).I've had great experiences pre-COVID-19, but when I went 3 times in June.. I was disappointed each time. The first time they had run out of boba. The second time they ran out of grass jelly. And the last time was when they closed their shop literally 30 minutes before it was supposed to close. Like c'mon... update your hours if you're going to close up at 6:30 instead of 7pm. This also wasn't a one time occurrence since the second time I had gone around 6:30 and watched them turn people away 10-15 minutes before 7pm and lock the door.Obviously their drinks are good and they do have a stamp card, but such poor service / management. I love their fruit tea and their brown sugar milk lattes are really good if you're looking for something indulgent and sweet! Make sure you order milk TEA latte if you're looking for tea in it versus the milk latte. I absolutely love that they have vitasoy / soymilk as an option for drinks. SO good. Their lemon tea is also really good and I love their grass jelly (I personally feel like it must be made in store)! But still with all those June issues, people needa be warned. Make sure you come here at least an hour before closing to be safe. Also they have a more limited menu due to COVID-19 aka they currently don't have any of their yakult / sago drinks."

Definitely this spot is cleaner, bigger, and have plenty of room and tables to sit down and talk with friends. I came with a group of six on a Wednesday night and it didn't seem too packed.I got their signature boba, which is the brown sugar pearl latte. The milk tea was blended nicely and you can definitely taste the flavors of the tea. The milk however tasted a little chalky in my opinion, and in terms of flavor I couldn't tell how the brown sugar was able to make it stand out compared to other regular boba tea. I wasn't a huge fan of the lack of sugar level customization of this tea. I understand the staff said its impossible to do customization, but still wish this option is available. Also wasn't too big of a fan of the tapioca cause it tasted a little doughy and chewy. Staff was friendly and the shop definitely is a cute place to hang out with friends or go on a date. Definitely recommend this over their flushing spot. As for the tea, it leaves more to yearn for."

I'm a female and I find it so disheartening when business owners board up their restrooms for no-good reason, especially since not being able to pee has dire consequences for women. If you want to support a local business that is nice to women, walk down a a couple of steps to bareback burger, the owner was amazingly gracious."

Very crispy and the pickled veggies and sauce was refreshing. The chicken pho was probably my favorite - I can see how others might find it ""bland"" but to be honest I find that most food in America are overly salted lol. The broth is exactly how I like it.

I thought the dish was flavorful, but something I could make at home or find at a no frills joint in my hometown (SF) for half the price. Pho Bo was decent too--broth was very clean and strong on anise. A bit not flavorful enough for me and I wish there was a more traditional spread of beef cuts (tendon, tripe, etc). The rice noodles were good in texture, not over cooked or undercooked the way some other spots serve pho in NYC.I guess I need to manage my expectations since trendy modern Vietnamese is just different from no-frill everyday Viet food joints.Overall, service was decent and ambiance was great.

I want with the Bo Kho, a ""Southern Vietnamese Style Beef Stew featuring premium gold coin beef shank, lemongrass, ginger, garlic, coconut juice, onion, carrots, cilantro, basil and a touch of dairy."" It is described as ""Beef Bourguignon made Vietnamese Style"" and it was served with some sliced Banh Mi for dipping. The stew was tasty with a good mix of textures and vegetables and the beef was tender. I would have preferred something a bit more then sweetness in terms of the broth but it was nicely rich. The Banh Mi slices on the side were much crustier then your typical which I liked in terms of flavors but it became a bit messy. The dish was $19 which was reasonable enough.The other person had the banh xeo or egg crepe for the same price. They forgot to ask for the vegan version and the very nice staff replaced it without any complaints. The vegan version lacks the pork or shrimp and they also replaced the usual fish sauce/nuoc cham with a vegan variety. I didn't try it but they liked it though I would say that the vegan version should probably be a couple bucks cheaper as it lacks the meat/shrimp and just contains a ton of bean sprouts and in general $19 is a bit much for the dish but the portion size was good. Tasty food here though my dish was definitely a lot more worth it for the price. The fact that the server replaced his dish without any issues was not just appreciated but was beyond normal service work. Kudos to him. Would go back to try more things."

Service is very nice. The waiters make the place fun and the food flow with almost no waits, and takes the restaurant to a whole higher level. The guy who serves water was really fun and nice. This team could not be better. Someone here knows how to build a team. This alone can make anyone's day.Now, the one thing that is not great is the space and it's design. I'd say that is totally uncared, but maybe someone put care in it, but just did not know how to do it. However, the design of the place is not at the level of the food and the service.

They weren't too busy but said they ran out of most every specialty drink and even some food over the weekend which was a bummer. Severely limited our options. My friend got the chicken pho and I got the Vietnamese stew. My stew was barely even warm but definitely brought Vietnamese beef burguignon vibes as promised. It had a lot of meat but I would have liked more stew. Overall tasty stuff but I guess come on a Friday or Saturday to make sure you can try what you want.
1672,lxQ-tzFmL1tmUqZUN-CSRQ,2/3/2022,4 star rating,"I came here for dinner with a group of friends on a Thursday evening. We had a reservation and were seated towards the back of the restaurant. The layout of the restaurant is very open with dividers between tables, which I thought was a nice consideration. We started off with ngheu xao bo-- clams with garlic butter and baguette. It was probably the highlight of our meal. The clams were so flavorful and the bread dipped in the sauce was a great touch. My friends all ordered the Pho Bo (beef) and I ordered the Pho Ga (chicken). I generally prefer to eat pho by dipping my noodles in a mix of the hoisin and sriracha, but the chicken pho was served with a sweet-ish herb sauce. It tasted okay, but I preferred my usual sauce mix. After I asked for the sauces, and my friend asked for some extra broth in his noodles, the waiter was quite dismissive of us, which made the experience pretty uncomfortable. Coming from Boston where a bowl of pho is usually $9-10, I was left disappointed after trying the pho here. I think the tapas are likely the stars of their menu, so I would focus on those menu items. Overall: I had a good time here and the food was good, but the food and service didn't impress me. If I came here again, I would order more tapas and not just a bowl of pho."

Didn't know what to expect since this is a relatively new restaurant and in a more gentrified area but everything was very tasty. The interior is nice and they have clear dividers for COVID safety."

The garlic makes the whole dish come together. Can't wait to come back to try their clams! Highly recommend this place. They usually have a line and take reservations for dinner.

I'd really rate it a 2.5 star kind of place and that was mostly over the two different components to a good asian bakery. 1) the bread products 2) the tea. This place failed on the tea and seemed to have decent bread products here.I ordered a iced lemon tea and a spam and egg sandwich.The tea was a bit off, I could not tell if it was over steeped or if they added ice to it while the tea was still too hot, maybe in the end it was just sitting in a jug for way too long.The spam and egg sandwich. The bread was fluffy and soft, with a slather of mayo and lettuce to compliment and give texture to the sandwich. It was well done. a little lite on the eggs, but still good.If this place's evening crew could get the tea part of the equation to a good asian bakery, I would happily revisit, until then, they will not see me back for a while."

Â It's fortunate that this day happened to have been a company holiday for me, so I would not have to leave my apartment. Â I got out of bed from the last day of my Christmas weekend slumber and headed to the bathroom. Â I turned on the lights and guess what happened? Â The light bulbs in the bathroom blew out. Â Let me tell you, it's always a special adventure to stand over the urinal in the dark trying to piss into it. Â But it was not nearly as much fun as I remembered it since I was doing it sober this time around. Â As much as I am a dirty hobo, there are lines that I would not cross, and so unfortunately I would have to leave the apartment after all. Â Off to brave the cutting winter wind to go buy some light bulbs. Â And since I was going out anyway, I went to grab some lunch as well.The streets of Flushing were faring not much better this day than they were the day before during the snow fall. Â The aftermath of Snowmageddon was evident from the cars still stuck in the snow, as many residents laboured in the chilling cold to dig them out. Â Of all the days to be indecisive about where I wanted to eat, it had to be today, but you have to admit, there are many options to choose from in Flushing. Â Eventually I decided on Tong Hai Tung as I remembered that I liked it the last time I was there and I had wanted to go back.From the street level, Tong Hai Tung is a simple Chinese bakery, but perhaps unbeknownst to many passerbys, it has a second floor where customers can actually sit down and order dishes. Â This dining area has a huge and beautiful fish tank and as a former aquarium enthusiast, I could tell it was a labour of love to maintain. Â The wall to the side of the restaurant is all glass, from which customers can people watch from the second floor while they eat. Â I settled down in one of the tables right next to the window so I can watch the cars and people outside navigate the snowy streets. Â Tong Hai Tung's menu features mostly Hong Kong-style cafe food. Â I knew I had to have a HK-style milk tea, and I also wanted some simple toast with butter. Â I almost ordered the beef brisket over rice for the main event of lunch, but I eat beef brisket a lot so I chose the diced chicken curry over rice dish instead.I was not aware of this when I ordered it, but the curry chicken dish came with a simple bowl of seaweed and egg soup. Â It tasted kind of plain but with a bit of saltiness. Â The milk tea and the toast came out while I was having the soup. Â Again, both very simple items. Â The milk tea was given to me in a paper cup for some reason, I'm guessing they got it from downstairs in the bakery. Â I'm not sure what kind of butter they use, but buttered toast in HK-style cafes always taste a little more greasy and satisfying than buttered toast I make for myself or at other cafes, and Tong Hai Tung's buttered toast was no exception. Â After finishing this toast, the diced chicken curry over rice was served. Â The curry in this dish was dry, in that it wasn't a dish with curry sauce. Â It was more akin to the curry in Singapore fried rice, where the ingredients of the dish were cooked in yellow curry powder. Â The rice was lightly fried together with the diced chicken, and the chicken meat was tender but perhaps a little dry. Â There was just enough curry flavour to make it savoury but not exactly spicy.Tong Hai Tung is at a nice location where people can sit down and enjoy some food after walking around the neighbourhood, and I love the big window from where you can people watch on the second floor. But ultimately the food isn't really anything above average compared to what Flushing has to offer."

They have really good peanut butter toast with condensed milk, egg with ham, egg with spam, pineapple bun with roast pork in the inside, garlic bread, sponge cake, noodles with soy sauce and peanut butter and their teas are good too. Lately, their tea taste a little funny, i think they changed their tea brand. Also sometimes they put mayo and lettuce in the spam and egg, or spam and ham sandwich, which sometimes is a little weird. I ask them not to put these two items. In addition, they also went up in price. They raise the prices on some of the items and sometimes I dont think it worth it. I would buy their bread products but probably not their teas. I think tea is easy to make, it basically, tea with sugar and milk, or tea with lemon and sugar, or tea with honey, but I seem them mess it up. It depends on who makes it, sometimes it would be really sweet, sometimes not too sweet. I would say go for the food and not the drinks that they make."

My favorites are the taco, sukuti (jerky) and chaat momo. That being said, Â what really set me off was their steamed chicken momos. It was a real let down. It had a really weird and off taste and smell to it to the point where me and my friends could not eat it anymore- and we hate wasting food. I don't know if it was just a one time thing but I've heard it from others as well. So yes it's worth the hype when it comes to their fried momos. As for the steamed- I'd say avoid it."

Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined that Momos could be prepared in such a way: tandoori grilled, sautÃ©ed in spicy sauces, or in a soup. The geniuses behind Momo Crave have taken a simple street food and turned it into a bold and fun new cuisine. We had some of their most popular offerings: the Chili Momo, Tandoori Momo, and Sandeko Momo. After eating these, we were ready to order the entire menu to experience every single unique flavor. The Chili Momo was my favorite: spicy, maybe a little sweet, and so spectacularly saucy! The Tandoori Momo is a must try. The move is to take a bite, fill the Momo with the delicious cilantro chutney, and then finish it off. The Sandeko Momo was the most unique flavor. There were nutty undertones to this soupy dish and it was very tangy. With our first bite we went ""woah!"" Because the flavor was so unexpected. Cant wait to come back and literally eat every single kind of Momo they have"

Probably a good spot for a meat lover but for me as a vegetarian it was waste of money. I ordered their chili Momo and chow mein for take out. The Momo was ok nothing nothing exceptional but not bad at all. The chow mein was literally a complete waste of money!! They were dry, Â lacked flavor and barely had any veggies therefore I requested to add some veggies. I love how the guy at the register and the other female employee in the back seemed to be just laughing at my request. If I'm paying you I expect my food to be as described per your menu don't try to give me something that's literally nothing like it.

Jol means gravy. My son always love the regular beef steamed Momo. We ordered a take out and my god we were all in for a very pleasant surprise. They were all really good. We loved all our orders and they tasted awesome and were very fresh. Even the ""achar""/dipping sauces added flavors to the Momo. There were two sauces - the regular red spicy Chilli achar/sauce which I loved and I really liked the milder sauce/ achar too. My wife loved her spicy Chilli Momo while my son finished all the Momos we had ordered for him . Well, I finished all my JOL Momo like a giant. I loved the spicy Chilli Momo as well. I later dipped my chicken chomein/ noodle in the remaining JOL and gobbled it all. It was sooo yummy. We are definitely coming for more orders and try out the other items in their menu. Highly recommended.PS: We are ""self-proclaimed Momo experts"" because we literally grew up eating momos throughout our lives and we are also good at making them ourselves at home :) ."

There are two tables that seat roughly 3 people and a small counter space seating. They have a simple menu with a variety of appetizers, sandwiches, salads, and drinks. I got the Zon sandwich ($10.50) and was happy with what I chose. The bread was perfectly toasted and the perfect amount of pate, pickled carrots, and meat.

The summer rolls were fresh and crunchy with shrimp, but nothing too exciting that I'd want to order them again.The best dish? The beef curry Banh mi! Totally shocked me. So flavorful and creamy and delicious on the crunchy bread. I'm not even a big fan of curry and this completely won me over. Would give this five stars.

It was a little out of the way but we decided to make our way there anyway.I ordered the Zon Sandwich (Pate, Vietnamese Ham, Vietnamese Salami, Shredded Pork Jerky) which is pretty much the classic Viet sammie. It's definitely not the best banh mi I've ever had and more expensive than I would generally care to pay for one of these, but it did the trick. The bread was perfectly toasty, which to me is one of the most, if not THE most important part of a banh mi. Plus, even though they were almost closing, the ingredients were not compromised. They didn't skimp on anything, and nothing tasted like it was sitting out all day.I definitely wouldn't come out of my way to come here again but I am grateful that Banh Mi Zon was able to satisfy that craving."

It has salami, ham, pork jerky, pate, pickled carrots & veggies.Chicken Banh Mi :: I ordered the spicy one again and the chicken was better than I expected. It was tender but heavily marinated so I did not taste as much of the picked veggies on this one compared to the classic Zon. But this is their most popular Banh Mi.I also ordered the Vietnamese coffee and it tastes more authentic than the Vietnamese coffee I had at the Vietnamese restaurant.

Unlike other bubble tea places, they don't really allow for changes in sugar and ice level. I usually like mine 25-50% sweet. But to my surprise, I didn't find it unbearably sweet. I got the #4 in the latte series with a cream mousse on top which I think balances out the sweetness. I liked that the bobas came in two sizes!I'm not one to crave boba, but if I do, I'm happy to have Tiger Sugar as an option."

Everyone was paying credit card, so if you have cash, you could order and get your drink more quickly. They also take online orders, which would be even faster.I ordered their signature drink: the Black Sugar Milk with Boba, Pearl & Cream Mousse ($5.51+). It was delicious and I loved the creaminess. The boba was chewy and tasty, although there was a bunch of little boba. I would have preferred to just have regular sized boba.Also, with these Black Sugar Milk series, you don't have the option to adjust the amount of sugar or ice. The ice took up nearly 1/3 of the cup, so the actual amount of drink wasn't as much as it seemed--which may be good for portion control.I did get a gold reusable straw, which was a nice touch and much easier to drink with than a paper straw. Can't wait to use it again :)"

I didn't expect much different from Tiger Sugar but I stopped by since I was in the area and had some time. Interior feels pretty standard, with a few sparse wall decorations/art that suits their tiger theme. Due to covid, there's no sitting space either. Ordering is done online or using the tablet in store.Again, basically all the drink options sounded the same to me so I just picked one from their popular list... I ordered the black sugar milk with boba, pudding, and cream mousse. It looked very pretty with ""stripes"" from the sugar/syrup. Less exciting appearance after shaking the cup and mixing the ingredients, but it actually tasted really good. I normally don't get toppings because the tastes/textures don't always mesh well with the drink but I actually loved the pudding and boba together.

The boba came out very quickly, but the store was also completely empty. I didn't expect the number 1 drink to have coffee jelly because I've only ever seen people get their brown sugar boba with no additional toppings, but I'm convinced. Coffee jelly is 100% a great addition and if you haven't tried it in brown sugar boba, now is a great time to try."

I was surprised that it wasn't overly sweet, the boba was a chewy consistency and the soy milk wasn't too milky so it was a good strong coffee flavor. Just good flavor balance and I was really happy with the drink overall. They also gave a free reusable straw! Glad there was a dairy free option (soy or lactose free milk) for us intolerant or vegan.

If you order their regular teas or lattes, you can adjust the ice and sugar levels. The Yelp elite event came with a reusable gold straw which I thought was a nice touch. As I was out and about, I didn't get to consume the drink til about an hour later. It still tasted great with that smokey brown sugar flavor. I do agree with many other complaints that most of the drink is ice. I do wish that the store can improve on that as the normal price of the drink is $6."

I'm super pleased with the service, ease of ordering, and their lactaid milk option. Tiger Sugar is a brown sugar specialist, but we tried to get a variety of drinks and ended up with: Fresh Taro + Boba + Taro Pudding Milk with Cream Mousse (4/5), Brown Sugar Mochi + Boba with Cream Mousse (2.5/5), Black Sugar Lemon Oolong Tea (3.5/5), Brown Sugar Matcha Latte with Cream Mousse (4/5), Brown Sugar Chocolate Malt Milk with Boba + Pearl + Cream Mousse (3.5/5)The boba here is very similar in texture to Xing Fu Tang's. When we went there, I described the boba as ""soft in a weird way,"" and I'd agree with that sentiment- they're really missing the Chew Factor. When you bite into them, they slice pretty cleanly in half and then they have this way of dissolving on your tongue. I do like that they give you a mix of both mini pearls and regular sized boba though! It switches up the textures and keeps the drink fun & funky & fresh. And even though the chew factor is lost, the boba has really good brown sugar flavor. Quick comments on each of our drinks: the fresh taro was good but very sweet, the brown sugar chocolate malt milk was very much just glorified chocolate milk, the brown sugar mochi was strange because of the way the mochi was sucked up the straw, and the lemon in the lemon oolong tea was overpowering.Our drinks were a bit inconsistent this time around because we wanted to try some new ones here, but we rounded our 3.5/5 up to 4 because the classic brown sugar milk is real good if you're a brown sugar person. We'd recommend the classic brown sugar milk with cream mousse. If you want to switch it up, we'd probably recommend the fresh taro or the matcha!"

I used the computer to place my order, seamless process. The drinks were a decent price, came out to about $12,for the two drinks. They do accept credit cards which is always a plus!

Sundaes cost up to $8.00 and you are getting a lot of nothing. Sundaes are unmarked so a vanilla sundae looks the same as a bana flavored or pecan flavored ice cream. How the hell can you tell. They have knuckle head teenagers working that don't give a damn. This place really has gone down hill especially under the new management and ownership.

I have ordered many ice cream cakes over the years for various occasions and always had a pleasant experience. This past Saturday, I went in to pick up a cake for my sons birthday that I had ordered the week before. When I arrived to pick it up on Saturday at 2:30, there were only 2 young people working the shop to cover the counter, the back dining room and the orders to be made and taken out. After waiting about 30 minutes to pickup my cake, the girl at the counter took the cake out of the freezer to show me and there were no decorations on the cake. When I commented why the cake was so plain, she said I needed to specify what decorations I wanted on it when I ordered it. When I had ordered it a week earlier I specifically said,"" please decorate it for my grown sons birthday, you have always done a beautiful job in the past so I will leave it up to you. ""When I the girl this, she took the cake in the back and stuck a toothpick of 5 pink & blue balloons on it. I told her it looked like a baby shower bouquet and she agreed and said I was right. She then went in the back again and put a primary color toothpick of balloons. I took the cake but was not happy. I told her I don't blame her, she is not the cake decorator.

I came in expecting it to be like Eddie's Sweet Shop, but I left loving this so much more. First off, they're so friendly here! I kind of felt like I was home. So much of it brought me back to my childhood, especially all the candies I grew up eating. I expected the flavors to be limited to old fashioned flavors, but I was surprised to see their monthly special which had chocolate Oreo delight and captain crunch. They offered 15 flavors or more and tons of different toppings. I had to try the Chocolate Oreo Delight because I was afraid I wouldn't be able to the next time I come back. I got one scoop in a chocolate cone. When my waitress gave me my cone, my eyes were literally so wide. It was HUGE! And when I got my check, my mouth literally dropped! I spent less than $5 for my cone. This is like Carvel price, but better ice cream!The ice cream was soooo good! It was creamy and chocolatey.

Â I'm obsessed with anything with peanut butter and to me the extra peanut butter it was topped with made it fantastic! Â The brownie was so good too! Â The ice cream itself I just found it to be ok besides the new Love Potion flavor which was really good! Â The brownie Sundaes here are amazing! Â I highly recommend you ordering one! Â The next time I go I'll try their chocolate chip or apple pie sundae. Â The sundaes here are excellent and worth coming in for. Â But, for getting plain ice cream with no topping I don't recommend coming in for unless they get some more unique flavors. Â Two toppings they should add are Reese's cups and cookie dough my other favorites. Â Today they turned me into a regular, and I highly recommend coming here for their brownie sundaes! Â Eating that warm brownie sundae topped with extra peanut butter made my whole day great!"

Two completely different and distinct flavors which completely threw us off... But then we figured, hey... Maybe it's not their specialty. So then we ordered Cuban Sandwiches because we just couldn't eat that ""Paella"". To our disbelief the Cuban Sandwiches were even worse! Not only was the bread burnt but they didn't even have pickles or ham and they never told us until we asked why it wasn't in our sandwiches lol ...We live in the neighborhood but wouldn't consider going back :("

It's time to put our dollars where our mouths are and support local Blacked-owned restaurants/businesses. A great place to support = the Soul Spot.I was having my bi-annual fried chicken craving (ok, maybe it's a lot more frequent than that), and was scouting Yelp for places to order from. The prices seemed fair, the menu looked diverse enough, and they had relatively fast delivery. I placed an order on DoorDash at about 5:30 PM and received my order within 50 minutes.My roomie and I ordered:Fried chicken platter with mac n cheese and fries (comes with cornbread)Jamaican jerk chicken platter with candied yams and stuffing (comes with cornbread)LemonadeTotal of order through DD with tip = $41Also ordered a banana pudding, which they, unfortunately, ran out of and reimbursed me for. But I won't focus on the ugly. The food came in fresh and hot and really satisfied my craving!The fried chicken isn't the best I've had but was decent enough; it was hot and tasty and not too oily. fries are the ones that are like thinner potato wedges. The mac n cheese was gooey and separated from the chicken by wax paper. The cornbread was just mealy enough. And the lemonade helped wash it all down. It was cold, sweet, and tart. The food was good, but not specifically out of this world. What I was impressed by to give the 5 stars is how tasty fresh and hot the food through delivery. Support local, support Black-owned!"

The mac and cheese was mushy and bland. The sweet potato pie tasted off. The lemonade was too sweet and not very lemon-y.The worst part: They were out of bread pudding, so they replaced it (without asking) with banana pudding (which I hate) and charged me for the switch! Rude. There have to be better soul food restaurants in Brooklyn. This is not the one."

Almost everything I've eaten from here has given me warm inner fuzzies. No, not in a bad was-that-mold way. Definitely in a happy and comforting way.The jerk chicken is tasty, well spiced, and fall-off-the-bone tender. The meatloaf is a massive brick of meat (slightly firmer than I'd like but still good) with a tasty glaze. The chicken and dumplings is the epitome of comfort food. The oxtail is very tender and flavorful. The macaroni and cheese is the perfect combination of cheesy, gooey, and wonderful. I'm a big fan of their collard greens, as well as their okra with stewed tomatoes. The plantains are missing that nice bit of crisp and caramelization, but they're still soft and sweet. Each meal also comes with cornbread that's quite good and makes its small size seem like a bit of a tease.You get a platter of protein, two sides, and cornbread, all for around $12 and easily splittable for two meals. All hail affordable yet wonderfully delicious food!P.S. You can currently order delivery from them. Glad COVID-19 hasn't stripped away all my food options."

The lamb chops were fall-off-the-bone tender & served in a brown gravy that was savory but not overpowering. The mashed potatoes also played their part to perfection. They were mostly smooth with a few pieces of potato still intact for texture. They paired perfectly with the lamb chops.The mac & cheese gave the tangy contrast to the savory lamb chops. As the most important side of any soul food plate, they delivered.The cornbread was delicious and complimentary. In fact, it was better than the piece of pond cake that I bought and had the aftertaste that I usually associate with those individually wrapped store bought slices. The only reason I couldn't give the meal 5 stars.I'll be back because the beef ribs and stewed chicken, greens and mixed vegetables all looked great!Tip: I got there about 11:30am and it looked like the food had just been put out."

The cookies were so delicious--warm and fresh, soft in the center and crisp on the edges, with massive gooey chunks of chocolate. And did I mention they smell heavenly?That being said, there were very limited options available. They legit took six flavors off the menu and only God knows why. I would understand if one or two flavors were unavailable, but six?! Also, in terms of service, I've read some of the other reviews and it seems like a hit-or-miss situation and clearly, today was a miss. My sister was trying to take a picture of the menu for me, and asides from one male employee, the rest of the staff were far from friendly. I get that the employees were in a rush as the place is tiny and the line was long, but that's no excuse to be rude, crabby, or condescending. No matter how good these cookies are, just based on the terrible service alone, I would not return."

1801,nqXvLzqzQQTJ2eMPkAcojw,7/19/2021,5 star rating,I pass this little bakery all the time when I'm in the city. Location: This is located in midtown down the street from the Empire State Building. You can easily take most trains and get here. Cupcake: The cupcakes are delicious! They are pretty pricey though...This is the type of treat that I will have sparingly because I think the prices are ridiculous and it is really small portions. I like the red Â velvet but sometimes it can be a bit dry so it is a hit or miss. The frosting is good not too sweet or artificial tasting. I would recommend trying this place if you want a sweet treat and you are in the area but I would not go out of my way to come here.
1802,nqXvLzqzQQTJ2eMPkAcojw,5/4/2022,4 star rating,Not a bad place for cupcakes in the city. However if you have time there are definitely better places to get cupcakes. But this place suffices for standard flavors

Their other store has always had good quality and fresh batches, but this store is clearly neglecting their product standards. Bought two brownies and this is what they looked like. It's clearly not fresh -- more like it's more than a week old. If this the case, I'm not sure how old the products are that they sell us. This is unacceptable and quite honestly a safety hazard."

Cupcakes were extremely dry and very disappointing."

Thanks Natalia!! will be coming back as it's a convenient location off the 4,5,6 (green) lines and fresh inventory. the cupcakes were moist but not sticky or wet and the frosting was superb."
1806,nqXvLzqzQQTJ2eMPkAcojw,5/2/2022,2 star rating,Frosting is way too sweet and grainy. The cake cracked and leaned. Overall I wouldn't order from here again and feel like there are much better options throughout the city.

1808,nqXvLzqzQQTJ2eMPkAcojw,2/1/2020,3 star rating,"This review was based on a single layer cake ordered ahead of time. Overall this place is really 3.5 stars with potential for me to update my review to an official 4 stars if given another chance. Please note: this is more of a satellite location where they have single serving goods on display, and if you order a cake, the cakes get delivered the morning of to this location (or some point during the day). What makes this place great was the ease of ordering a cake online - single layer chocolate cake. Everything came out as expected and on time. The price was reasonable for a NYC Cake. The other desserts on display looked delicious and staff was super friendly. Reasons why I can't give this place a perfect score include: - Additional charge just to write a limited inscription (under 25 characters or something like that). It was a crazy amount, but to write something simple like ""Happy Birthday"" should be a given. I could see charging extra for a graphic or something. - I think the fact that this is a pickup location versus an actual bakery where the cake is made would steer me to other places in the future. The cake looked beautiful and the frosting was on point. But the cake itself wasn't as moist and fluffy versus other cakes I've had that came from the bakery itself (If Magnolia Bakery cake is benchmark, this cake was a level below in terms of moist and fluffiness). I couldn't pinpoint whether it was because the cake was sitting out until I picked it up in the evening, or that was just how they baked the cake itself. In terms of taste - this chocolate cake was a legit 3.5 - not bade to have if its their, but not exactly how I'd want to spend my calories on a dessert if I were to splurge. In summary, the person I got the cake for was a fan, and enjoyed it. I'd be willing to give this place another try since it's close to my office, but if someone were to get me a birthday cake, I may request it comes from a bakery where the actual cake is made and the cakes are known to be perfectly moist (better than Magnolia)."

Â This trip to NYC, seeing that they opened a location that was not too far from our hotel, I decided to give them a try. Â This location is very small as they don't make any cupcakes there. Â Instead, they are baked elsewhere and delivered to this location.I was there on a Friday in the late afternoon and at that time of day, the selection was limited. Â However, I heard the clerk tell another customer that they had gotten another delivery but hadn't had time to get them in the display case. Â That said, I was happy with the selection that was out on display.I chose 2 lemon raspberry meringue cupcakes, 1 apple pie cupcake and 1 carrot cake. Â The clerk was very friendly and helpful.Later in the day, we each ate a lemon raspberry cupcake---and we really liked them. Â The cake was moist and you could clearly taste the lemon. Â In the center were macerated fresh raspberries. Â The meringue frosting was hit with a blow torch which added an interesting char flavor. Â All those flavorings worked very well together. Â Torching the top was, so to speak, the icing on the cake.The next day I had the apple pie one. Â It had a nice flavor to it with the apple coming through clearly as did the cinnamon. Â The frosting had a bit of caramel on top which worked very well with this cupcake.My husband had the carrot cake one. Â It had a wonderful cinnamon-y smell to it. Â He really liked the flavor and said he would have it again.So...we will be back when in town. Â Maybe next time we'll try some different flavors."

Our faves were:- Funfetti Sugar Cookie- Funfetti Cereal Bar (w/ Fruity Pebbles)- Vanilla Vanilla CupcakeWe also got a free mini cupcake when we checked in (thanks Yelp!). If you are in the area local or during your vacay defintely give it a shot. 4.5/5!

Clustered with a bunch of other eateries, along with an outdoor seating area (outside the storefront, and then further in the so called square). Be advised people also smoke around here during their break, so you may get a whiff or two of that. Inside, there isn't much seating; two small sections of mounted counter tops and high chairs. On the side that's facing the window you can people watch as tourists/workers walk around. On the flipside, they can watch you stuff your face, so if tartar sauce happens to drip down your chin because you doused your fish in it, wipe it up fast....or let them think you're a slob. The food was so good, I didn't care if I ate like a beast. Mostly a to-go spot. With the food pictures on the walls, fluorescent lighting, sparse seating, and the numbered menu items, it kind of reminds me of a Chinese takeout joint. Â It's a bit jarring when you walk in. The women are friendly enough -- asking what you want to order, patiently waiting as you decide what you want to get. Food -- Fish sandwich, with fries and an order of cole slaw: -Cole Slaw was so disappointing. Not only was it pretty small for $2, but it lacked any taste or the creamy consistency I had hoped for. That's just what I'm used to in diners. If anything, it seemed dried out and sticky at the same time. Not appetizing and after a small forkful I did not want to eat it anymore.-Fried fish was thin, completely breaded, and perfectly fried, with a nice crunchy bite. The fish flaked off with each bite. Tasted fresh, not overly fishy. -came with whole wheat bread, even without my specifying. Also some ice berg lettuce and tomato slices-Huge portion of French fries. Half a styrofoam container full of them. Thick cut fries too (think the same as Burger King, maybe even a bit thicker), golden, very crisp, and hot/fresh. Only ate a few because the sandwich was so filling. Fried fish, shrimp, and rice platter: The whole container was full of rice , which came with tiny bits of shrimps. Fried fish and shrimps were the same level as the sandwich -- crispy, golden, even breading throughout the entire seafood. No chunks of breading falling off in random spots. Drinks options -- Snapple, water, Pepsi, Spite, Coke, Mountain Dew, Ginger Ale, etc. Lined on the counters are squeeze bottles of ketchup, tartar sauce (delicious! perfect tang from the relish), maybe bbq sauce or hot sauce? I couldn't tell because they weren't labeled. But it was perfect because we definitely refilled our ramekins of tartar sauce repeatedly."

I got the bacon bbq burger in medium rare, and a side of regular fries which you can get for free with any purchase of a burger if you check in on Yelp! Burger was $16, tax and tip not included. Burger was very juicy! The patty was delicious. The bacon on top and the fried onions added a nice crunchy texture to the patty. Patty seasoned very well. The fries were really crispy and airy. Definitely portion wise its good for a meal! Would come back again whenever I'm around the area!"

Â I did that option. Â The burger was okay-cooked well and the flavors were alright, but I was expecting a little bit more 'umph' to it I guess. Â The sweet potato fries were not good, not much flavor, unfortunately, but they were plentiful. Â But again, I was starving, so it was decent enough.I know it's Times Square, but wowza. Â $23 for a pretty basic burger (I did add bacon and a pretzel bun), fries, and a lemonade.

Everything was kinda warm cold and left me under the impression it had been sitting around all day or my waiter waited too long to serve it to me. To accompany the burger i ordered sweet potato fries which were wimpy and cold, i returned it for a fresh order and they were warmer but still wimpy. I imagined the flavors of the burgers and the condiments accompanying it to bring out this sweet flavor that you wouldn't expect in a turkey burger or at least the feeling of thanksgiving but I didn't get that.

This place is not what the reviews suggest. i really wanted to love this place but as with all jamaican ""restaurants"" there is never any customer service or consistency. I am just going to sum this up.Was looking for a good jamaican jerk spot. Did a yelp search and found this place. First time here i went during the lunch hour. The chicken was fresh as if it just came off the grill and chopped and spiced. I enjoyed the chicken the first time round. The rice was horrible as was the service.second time i went here was in the evening because i thought, ok the chicken was good but the rice was bad so i will only get the chicken and eat it with bread. ok got the chicken and to my surprise it was horrible. dry rubbery and stale. (YUK) i salvaged what i could and threw out the rest.third time i went here to give them a 3rd and final chance and they failed!!. chicken was raw and rubbery, the rice was once again disgusting. I was sitting in my car outside the restaurant and i was going to bring it back and ask for my money back but after the horrible customer service i received just placing a order i foresaw that there would most likely be a confrontation so i just threw out the rest.oh! not to mention that the hygiene standards at this place is non existent. people dishing out food while holding up rice spoon and coughing into their elbow with food trays open.

I'm going to say their jerk chicken and white rice is delicious. The rice itself has this aroma to it that I can't stop eating it. And my grandmother loves their curry goat dinner.This is the disappointment. Their jerk pork is tough like hell. You know the saying ""It's like Pulling Teeth""? Perfect example. What a shame! And after a few hours, their salad looks brown and taste like its spoiling and the macaroni salad taste horrid too. Come on now, how can you mess up a good home cooked meal like that?And they need to improve a little more on their customer service. I'm use to attitude at Jamaican restaurants because some of these women probably got issues or they just don't care for people that they're serving...

More substitutions should be added instead of just rice and peas or white rice. If you must come here, it looks like chicken is the best option. I wont be returning."

It was intriguing as I never thought I would see $2 coffee drinks in NYC, much less anywhere else. I ordered a 16oz iced cappuccino with almond milk. $2 for 16oz is a wild concept; I've been ordering $6 8oz drinks for years. I made my way over once I got the notification that my drink was ready. My drink was ready very quickly, and I picked it up with no problem. I really thought it was too good to be true and I was right. I could immediately tell from the first lukewarm sip that it was not almond milk. While it's only a taste issue for me, this mistake would not fly with those that are lactose intolerant or with vegans. I will give this place a another chance however and hope that this was just a one time issue."

They have espresso machines, frozen hot chocolate, 3 types of iced tea, 4 organic juices, 1 smoothie, hot and iced coffee, and cold brew.  In the snack department, they offer nuts, oatmeal, Belgian waffles, burekas, croissants, coffee cake and sweets. There are also a variety of small deli sandwiches. I ordered a frozen hot chocolate with chocolate croissant. Total was $4.36 and I paid with my credit card. There is plenty of nice seating in the A/C. They even warmed up my croissant for me!They use Bristot coffee, and offer small and large for their hot drinks. Both are still only $2.

Al pastor was sooo good. tasty... i wanted to eat 3 more. i wish they put a little more pineapple in but still good.

I had to make a taco holder out of napkins lol$4-5 for a taco is a bit pricey and can definitely add up. Especially compared to west coast prices. My boyfrien and I got 8 tacos and it was $40. They do load up the taco and it is good!! I love that they have the condiments bar - with red sauce, green sauce, red onions, and cilantro. The meat is tender and flavorful, and the taco is warmed up and has a slight crunch."

They fill the meat so that it's basically spilling out of both ends of the tortilla, and The tortilla is fried in pork fat which makes it even more flavorful. With that said there's no vegetarian options because even the tortilla is dipped in meat juice. Every hour of the day I've come here there is a line so be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes."

You can scan the menu outside of the building but if you want a aesthetic food video, there's a menu on the wall inside the store.Due to no takeouts, staffs have to coordinate how many people are allowed inside and time the amount of time customers are sitting and eating, which was cool to me. I got the one of Al pastor ($5), suadero ($4), longaniza ($4), campechano ($4) and tripa ($5). There is a small station near the entrance for lime, two different sauces, onions and cilantro which I was applied generously on my tacos. All the tacos were decent, not so friggin good that I would travel all the way to Brooklyn for them. Al Pastor (3.5/5) comes with a slice of pineapple which I was excited about. However, the meat wasn't charred enough for me to have the smoky flavor the meat. If it was charred a bit more, I believe the pineapple slice on top would be perfect! Suadero (3/5) was an interesting texture for me. It wasn't too chewy or fatty, sort of in between soft meat. I wouldn't say the the meat was flavorful but it is a good taco.Longaniza (4/5) was so good! It might be my favorite taco from this selection. It has a slight kick without the sauces you add and you get the charred taste as well. Campechano (3.7/5) is a combination of both Suadero and Longaniza which does taste good. Perhaps the longaniza helped me with the texture and flavor of the suadero, but overall a good taco to try both in 1 taco.Tripa (1/5) was the most disappointing and the most looking forward taco. I love beef intestines and I was so disappointed on this taco. The intestines were really gamey and not a pleasant texture in my mouth. Sauces, onions and lime were not enough to mask the gaminess.Overall, a good taco area in Brooklyn but I wouldn't personally recommend it to others. Would I stop by for a taco? Perhaps if I'm around the area. It is a fun restaurant experience with friendly staffs!!"

Apparently ingredients run out quick (they were already out of tripe and the consome at 6pm) so might want to show up early if you have something specific in mind. The campechano was definitely my favorite and i found the pastor too dry but others said that was their favorite. The red sauce is quite spicy so don't get too wild.

Â Their normal menu wasn't in service, and they were giving out 2 free tacos to everyone - no purchase! Â Yes you read that correctly, you walked up, you waited as they grilled delicious cecina tacos that could be topped with chopped up longaniza, as well as all the delicious normal toppings (cilantro, red onions, etc), and they just handed you a plate with 2 of them for free. Â The tortillas were fantastic, the cecina was fantastic, the longaniza was fantastic, the hot sauce was fantastic, the guac sauce...OK you get the idea.I love Mexican street tacos, I've eaten my way across 20 different places in Mexico City (I Â CDMX) - even just the 1 type of taco I was able to try tonight at Taqueria Ramirez totally did it justice.

When we first went, we ordered 1 of every thing: al pastor (pineapple seasoned pork), suadero (beef brisket), nopales (cactus), campechano (mixed meats), tripa (tripe), and loganiza (chorizo). Our personal favorites were the al pastor, and the suadero. The al pastor was flavorful, though on the saltier side. Â Instead of the campechano (mixed meats), order the meats separately, so you can taste the difference in each. On the second visit, the meats and tacos combined started to taste the same and it was hard to distinguish each taco from another. Ordering is quick and easy, and the service was fairly fast. There is a toppings bar in the place, for you to fill up on as much as salsa, sauces, onions, cilantro, and limes as you want. Be gentle on the red salsa, because he spice is REALLY there.

Â I liked the pieces of jalapeÃ±o and the chicken wasn't bland like most buffalo chicken dishes. Overall, solid spot spot for a quick bite.

What really caused me to clutch my pearls and say to myself, ""I need to go here!"", was their sloppy joe grilled cheese sandwich! Yes! I just said that! Read it again. I eased on down the road to get to Cheese Grille! This place is super LES, vibes-wise. Really cool decor of different music artists, graffiti, cartoons, hip-hop music playing, and a really cool menu that covers an entire wall! Such a dope vibe, and good, vibrant energy!So, like I said, that sloppy joe grilled cheese was the first on my to-eat list! Just the idea alone is fun, and innovative! Also, knowing that their bread is delivered to them fresh, daily, is also just another plus! I was highly excited when this was brought out. It's a beautiful sandwich! I pulled it a part to witness the most beautiful cheese pull, as well as that juicy ground beef and pickled jalapeÃ±os! I bit into it, only to have juice runnin' all over the place. The beef was so well flavored. I loved the addition of the pickled jalapeÃ±os! I love the pickle-y flavor and it went so well with this sandwich. The bread was nicely buttered and toasted. I did not wanna stop eating it! It truly exceeded my expectations, and that's always appreciated! I also got their buffalo chicken grilled cheese that was also served with pickled jalapeÃ±os! I loved this one! Nice, tender chicken, with a yummy buffalo sauce and blue cheese! Not quite the headliner like the sloppy joe, but still held its own. I also got the Little Italy, which is like pizza in the form of grilled cheese! Along with tomato sauce, it's served with pepperoni and pesto! This was such a special treat! I thoroughly enjoyed it! It truly gave me pizza vibes, but what really made it stand out, was the pesto sauce! I'd even order extra pesto sauce for my next visit because it was so good!Lastly, I ordered their fried Mac n cheese bites, which is served with a yummy tomato sauce. I have to say that as a black man who grew up eating amazing baked Mac n cheese, that theirs need some work. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but definitely lacking in flavor. Overall, these fried Mac n cheese bites are super fun and photogenic. I just think the Mac n cheese itself needs some work.Cheese Grille gets an ""A"" from me!

Kinda reminded me of a coffee shop, but lets get down to my food. 5-stars for my soup, it was hot and delicious and yes I will return for another bowl during many NYC cold weather days.3-stars for my Mac&Cheese bites, Ive had better and the ones I had here seem to have a strange taste the more and more I ate them, I do have to say that for the little they give you, they are really filling with a bowl of soup, heck even with the lil dipping cup of soup would of just been fine enough.The glass of wine I paid 8 bucks for was refreshing. I found the cucumber basil sangria a lil off in taste, but it could be right for maybe a hot summer day, just not today for me.Anyway, I found the place to be a cool lil spot and Ill be returning to try some of those grilled cheese sandwiches although it may be a to go order because this place doesnt look to be cozy enough to hang out in on a cold winters day.

It's some of the best Jamaican food I've had outside of my mom's house. Ask for their pumpkin and carrots with your vegetable sides, I promise, they are transformative.What gives Soup Bowl a 4 instead of a 5, in my opinion is the sluggish service. It is well known that you should call ahead for seafood dishes, they suggest 15 minutes. However, on several occasions, I've called while more than 45 minutes away and had to wait on shrimp dishes an additonal 15-20 minutes once there. In fact, earlier this spring, I called ahead for garlic shrimp while leaving the Palisades Mall in West Nyack, NY. With traffic on the Tappan Zee keeping us stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic for 30 minutes I was hoping to swoop into Soup Bowl, pay and leave. To my surprise, I waited an additional 20 minutes for a dish I was told would be ready 'soon'. I make shrimp at home frequently and even thawing frozen shrimp and then cooking it wouldn't take over an hour to prepare.

I also received cabbage in one plate and not the other , I don't know if this was by mistake or what. I took a chance ordering from here and I won't take it again. It was very overpriced for the amount of food I received. Honestly I ended pouring bbq sauce on top of everything to add flavor. It was very bland.

I've tried almost everything on the menu and I'm pleasantly surprised every time. The goat head soup is one of my favorite, it has the right amount of food, vegetables and the goat is very tender. The jerk goat was new to me though. It's a bit on the spicy side which definitely has a kick to it. My favorite Jamaican breakfast was the kidney, banana and dumpling. They did not disappoint, especially when it came to the portion. I'm always pleased with the oxtails. They are huge pieces, seasoned properly and falls of the bone. If you're getting the fried chicken, try the sauce with it as well, even though Â it's really good with or without it. The Bronx Â is so saturated with places like Frank's Soup Bowl but there's no comparison, so its nice to have a place that is very laid back and enjoy authentic Jamaican food that is also reasonably priced."

My boyfriend is part Cuban and we were excited to try some familiar dishes. To start, we got the croquetas corral. I got a mojito to drink and for my entree I got the Ropa vieja. It was so delicious - I really enjoyed this dish and it's more filling than it looks. I thought at first glance the portion size looked small, but I could barely finish! It was so tender and flavorful. I've only ever had Ropa vieja homemade before and this was definitely just as good! My boyfriend got the salmon carnaval and it was also super good. The creamy polenta was a great addition to the salmon. Service here was great, our waiter was very attentive and nice. My only complaint about this place was it was pretty warm inside - which was a little uncomfortable since I had a sweater on in (being winter time). The lighting was very dark in here as well - which wasn't the worst thing but kinda weird. I would've preferred a more open bright atmosphere to go along with these Cuban dishes and drinks. Online, the photos of the restaurant look open, airy, and bright. So I was a little surprised how dark it was in the evening. Overall, I would definitely return. The food was delicious and it can be challenging to find Cuban restaurants this good. Check this place out if you wanna try authentic Cuban cuisine."

We ordered guacamole with plantains and pollo empanadas to start. The guac was delicious and the plantains were perfect so those were a hit! The empanadas were tiny, burnt on the edges and pretty dry in the middle so they were a big disappointment. I got the bronzino, which was a daily special, for my main course. It was lightly grilled and a little too lightly seasoned but the salsa relish that comes with it helped. The sautÃ©ed greens that came on the side were bland and unappetizing so they weren't touched after one bite. The saving grace of the main course was their black beans and rice. Talk about the star of the show! These were seasoned WELL and were absolutely delicious - they are the must-try from their menu (even if black beans aren't generally your thing - they're that good!). Cocktails were also just okay. Oh but their churros on the s dessert menu are all fantastic! I'd come back for those as well as their black beans & rice, and their guac, or perhaps a happy hour to try more of their appetizers, if they have one."

They were organized and seated people in a timely manner. Those without a reservation they gave them realistic wait times and/or let them know what seating would be available. This is already a step up from the location we left.We had a great visit here. Our waiter Diego was awesome! Diego made the dining experience that much better with such a friendly Pleasant personality. Â Talk about knowing good customer service! A+++This was a spur of the moment visit and we made last minute reservations that were accepted and honored without issue. We arrived a few minutes early but were informed that it wasn't an issue and we would be seated soon. The restaurant may look small at first glance but it's actually pretty spacious. Â  We were seated in the area with the skylight which was great since it was still light out. And the food!? Awesome!! Our table spread consisted of: maduros, tostones, Ropa Vieja with white rice and black beans, Arroz Con Pollo, ensalada de palmitos y mandarinas, ceviche de camarÃ³nes, and flan. Everything was delicious! The ropa vieja was flavorful and the beef wasn't so shredded it looked weird or inedible. Even the black beans were good. It wasn't just a side of black beans plopped down in a bowl. The maduros and tostones both made just right! The maduros wasn't mushy or under cooked and the tostones weren't over cooked and rock hard. The arroz con pollo had nice juicy pieces of chicken This was a plus because we were trying it out during restaurant week to see if we would want to come back in the future. We also tried cocktails Â and they were the white sangria, the coconaty mojito, and the Hemingway daiquiri (which isn't like a typical daiquiri). Â Plus we didn't at any point feel rushed.After a hectic frustrating day coming here was a great ending and a pleasant time..We are definitely going to include Victor's CafÃ© in our regular rotation!"

Victor's was a few blocks away from the Walter Kerr Theatre and had open reservations. We arrived on time for our 5:30pm reservation on a Friday and it was pretty full already. By the time we left at around 7:15pm, it was packed. Definitely make reservations! Staff here are extremely nice and they all spoke Spanish, which my in-laws loved. We had their appetizer sampler to share between the four of us and it was just enough for us to each have a small taste - and still have space for our individual entrees. I opted to have two appetizers instead of one entrÃ©e - I had the ceviche and the shrimp & polenta. Both were great - the ceviche had a delightful citrus marinade. X had the lechon, which is a huge portion. In-laws split the lechon and the Ensalada de Palmitos y Mandarinas, which was delightful. The champagne dressing was light and flavorful. For dessert, we had the rice pudding, flan, and churros with 3 dipping sauces. The flan was fantastic and was honestly one of the best flans that I have ever had in my life. To drink, there were coconut mojitos all around. I opted for the Hemingway Daiquiri, with Blanco Rum, maraschino liqueur, fresh lime, and simple syrup. I really, really enjoyed my cocktail - it was just a bit sweet with a hint of tang from the lime. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. We felt like we had the time to leisurely enjoy our meals and they didn't rush us out. They even came around with a candle and sang Happy Birthday to X when we told them it was his birthday (early birthday?). If you're looking for an excellent pre-show meal, Victor's is a solid spot."

I did expect a lot from the Chicken Tikka Masala since I saw it was ""award winning"" but was a little disappointed. It was very watery/liquidy. I also think the spice level was toned down a little to satisfy the tastebuds of the people in their area. Smart business move but disappointing for myself. The Chicken Korma was a lot better and the waiter added some spice to it which I appreciated. It was creamy and delicious. I got it with cheese naan and onion kulcha. The cheese is paneer I think so more like ricotta consistency than mozzarella. Onion kulcha was very good and a perfect pairing with the korma. Both dishes came with rice.We ordered some onion bhaji for our apps but it tasted more like a pakora. It was very doughy and I don't think I'd recommend it. I did like the papadum and the green sauce was great! I think the service was great! They were very attentive and always checking in on us. They even gave us free dessert which was very sweet. It was rasmalai and it was VERY GOOD!!"

That is just ridiculous because if that was the case then how did they deliver the first time. A big waste of time.

1925,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,5/13/2022,5 star rating,My review of The Bombay Grill House 51st Street and 9th Avenue in Hell's Kitchen. In one word fantastic. I got there about 2 p.m. Friday afternoon May 13th 2022 and there were two other couples having either a late lunch or early dinner. I greeted the waiter with the traditional Hindu greeting namaste he responded the same I sat down and ordered one of these tall Taj Mahal beers from India. My first course where are some vegetarian vegetable fritters the name I can't remember the other appetizer was a fried cauliflower. They were to die for. I've been ordered my favorite dish matar paneer with a side of naan bread. The basmati rice was aromatic and very tasty. I still had some of my appetizers left when the main course arrives so I asked the waiter if I could wrap these up to go. He won't brought me a brown paper bag and to take out boxes which I thought was kind of funny cuz usually they take the plates from your table and bring back the food already packaged for you. When I asked him if he could take care of that for me he told me he was somewhat busy which I didn't believe there were only two other couples in the whole place so I took care of it anyway no problem me I enjoy the dining experience anyway goes. Again the food was very very delicious and I ate it with gusto. I had two of those large Taj Mahal beers that were ten bucks a piece my total bill was $57 not including the $10 check well worth the money. I did check in on Facebook that I was there if anybody want to come by and have a drink with me they were welcome but no one came by maybe next time.

Â So I stuck with my main entree and added the Garlic Naan to go along with it. Â When the entree arrived I noticed the masala sauce appeared to be a bit darker in color than I was used to. Â After the fist bite I realized this masala sauce had a very rich flavor, it was exceptional. Â The chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Â I found this to be one of the best tikka masala entrees I have ever had. Â The garlic naan was not undercooked and provided for a slight crisp to the bread, it was excellent. Â After dinner we were offered a desert which consisted of frozen orange cremes, still in the orange peel. Â This was wonderfully refreshing and a very nice surprise, a perfect way to end the dinner.The price point for the quality and quantity of food is excellent!

1937,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,9/20/2021,4 star rating,"At Nine Ratings: 4.3/5 Food: 4.5/5 - Did family style with my friend. Got the beef pad see ew and the chicken green curry. The chicken green curry was tasty and delicious, not too spicy, but loaded with flavors. The chicken was tender and veggies were fresh. I like the crispy wonton chips they added on the side too, added a good crunch to the dish. A top green curry I have had in NYC. I love the beef pad see ew too. The flat rice noodles was al dente and chewy, sauce was the perfect amount of sweetness, and fresh ingredients such as the eggs, broccoli, along with other garnish. The beef was juicy and easy to chewy, cooked perfectly. Both dishes were tasty, and we didn't even realized how fast we ate them. Ambiance: 4/5 - Tiny Thai restaurant located in Hell's Kitchen area. Interior is cute and got an intimate atmosphere; a lot of pretty decorations in the restaurant. There's big pink flowers hanging from the ceiling and paintings on the wall, kind of like a lower tier version of Oscar Wilde (a great cocktail bar located in Chelsea). It was also pretty dark inside, and people are sitting quite close to each other, so expect it to be loud. The interior seats are quite limited, since it is small but there's outdoor seatings available. Price: 4.25/5 - The two entrees: beef pad see ew and the chicken green curry came up to be around $33 before tips. Thought it was a very reasonable price for the amount of portion served and the quality of food was pretty good. Very worth it. Service: 4.25/5 - Good service and efficient staffs. They were fast and good at what they were doing and the food came out fairly quick. Our server came back and asked me if the spice level from the green curry was okay for me, since I was asking about it before I order, so super thoughtful of him for checking-in with me. BLUF: Incredible authentic Thai food in Hell's Kitchen, with reasonable price points, amazing happy hour drinks and deals, and very unique NYC vibe. Highly recommend the Pad See Ew, surprisingly good and not heavy at all. Solid and right now is one of my go to Thai place in Hell's Kitchen."

The space itself is relatively spacious - the tables were nice but I could see it getting crowded quickly.There are plenty of crepe options and gluten-free crepe options which was great for me. The choice of buckwheat for the gluten-free options was not the tastiest though, I've had gluten-free crepes that may have been made with corn which were much better. The buckwheat almost had a bitter taste to it. My one issue was that my order was not processed correctly and neither was my friends. They were two simple orders, her's was directly from the menu and somehow she ended up with goat cheese instead of gruyere. And I asked for no cheese and ended up with gruyere. The establishment was not crazy or packed at all which is why I did not understand why both of our orders were wrong. They quickly corrected my friends, but I didn't bother having mine corrected.Additionally, it was definitely pricey - okay, okay I know NYC UES what do I expect?

I knew I wanted to get the red wine braised beef, avocado, chili verde and spinach breakfast crÃªpe before I even got there. I came here around 10am (Saturday morning) and there were only two other customers. It's pretty chill; you order and pay at the front and then sit with minimal service (water if requested, food is brought out to you). I'm not sure how tipping works, but we left cash on the table when we left. + red wine braised beef, avocado, chili verde and spinach breakfast crÃªpeI'd give this 3 stars; it was a very interesting combination and I just wish the braised beef had been executed better; it was tougher than I had expected. (I had Xi'an's tonight and the beef was just exponentially better). The flavors were interesting and I enjoyed it overall, but I would definitely get something else next time. This crÃªpe also fell apart super easily and it was a little difficult to eat (though maybe I should've kept it in the container instead of cutting it with a knife and fork).+ egg, bacon & gruyÃ¨re omelette crÃªpeThis was pretty great - I'd give this 4 stars. Everything was solid - not overcooked egg, good texture bacon, melted gruyÃ¨re, awesome crÃªpe texture & flavor. Everything stayed together really well. It's not super interesting, but it's very breakfasty and I'd get this again. Overall, I'd come back to try their other savory crÃªpes and maybe a sweet one.

Some are decent but it pains for me to bother you with mediocrity. I will, however, write you to protect you from losing your hard-earned money. I tried their ceviche mixto and not only did it lack in quantity but in quality of flavor. Â If there ever was a frozen dinner Peruvian ceviche, this is how it would taste. It's not terrible to the palate, but too simple and not true to the cuisine. The shrimp was precooked but not my lime. Cocktail shrimp were added to a cold lemon soup. They dashed it with some calamari and I may have tasted some fish in there. I'm not sure... as it was a small serving. I may have inhaled it all in a few deep breaths without knowing after some long and very somber sighs. I ordered a Lomo Saltado but it never came. Amazon could have delivered it to me already. I felt terrible but I had to cancel the order after about 45 minutes after it was placed. Even though I sat in a party of 1 (me), I noticed that other tables next to me were being served 4 or more plates at a time. And while the music was lively and playing loud, I heard my inner sad violin playing more boldly. While I was canceling, behind me I heard in Spanish ""no se lo habia hecho"" [the cook had not done it]. Â So the bossman seemed satisfied in agreeing not to charge me for the Lomo. So I thought win, win? No, we both lost, unfortunately. Â Maybe it was a bad day or maybe it was not a good restaurant. I'll leave that up to you to decide. For me, this review is for this day because we both lost and I give myself 1 star as well. But I can't wait to find a restaurant worthy of my 5 stars soon and I'm not difficult, I just don't eat in too many new places. Being adventurous takes much curiosity, courage, and being fearless of risks and losses with a focus on discovering a satisfying treasure. I did not discover it this day but I hope you will when you search for it here. Ciao adventurers."

Empanadas were big! 2 in each orderTostones: I didn't try them but it was the one with most of the leftovers Salchipapa: okSide of salad: goodRoasted chicken: good portions, well cooked, tasty. Liked it very much.Rice and beans: yummy!! I guess because of the deal it was put all in one container, I would have preferred them separately.Alfajores: decentIt also came with lots of sauces which were delish as well. Note for the owner: I would appreciate if there is any way to kmow the name of the sauces and which one goes with what, but it is also fun to just try them all amd decide by yourselfOverall, we had a great meal and I would definitely repeat!"

It was that good! The food was great! We ordered the calamari, empanadas, octopus, shrimp ceviche, and lomo saltados. Everything was absolutely great. One thing I didn't like is that everything came out at the same time. Would have been nice to have the appetizers first, and then the entree. The empanadas were pretty big. The octopus was also pretty good. The ceviche was great - they don't have shrimp ceviche on the menu but they were able to still make it for me. The calamari was delicious, but they do put it on a bed of fries so I felt a little bit cheated. Our friends who came before us told us that we had to try the lomo saltaldo. It was indeed very good - cooked to perfection but it's a tad bit small for an entree & the price they charge. We ended off with the flan, and we all loved it. Overall, great place! Maybe the waitress could have been a bit nicer and smiled at least but I can't wait to come back and try some other items on the menu!"

1962,dzwa-zvkW6L2ZUGyNGrmuA,2/14/2023,5 star rating,"Second time coming back to Sushi On Jones. I swear this is the best crispy rice in all of Manhattan. The rice is soaked in sweet ponzu sauce - yet still crispy. Topped with buttery fresh salmon and spicy mayo. Simply to die for. I always go with the Blue Crab California and Spicy tuna maki as a main. Both are so fresh and delicious and pair well with spicy mayo on the side ;) Lastly, the nori fries were a lovely discovery this visit. Seasoned to perfection and paired with a beef fat mayo that was out of this world. Perfect with a crisp, ice cold sapporo. The service is always friendly and wonderful, and food comes out so fast. You can't go wrong wish Sushi On Jones!!! My favorite spot!"
1963,dzwa-zvkW6L2ZUGyNGrmuA,8/17/2022,4 star rating,The pricing seems reasonable for the amount of food you get. It's a good value in both amount and quality for the amount of money. I think there are better omakase places in the area but they are higher price points. The staff is super super nice. It's a 45 minute sitting for both 12 and 20 course options. I'd say it was well paced and efficient.
1964,dzwa-zvkW6L2ZUGyNGrmuA,6/11/2022,3 star rating,"One of the cheaper omakase places in the city - 12 pieces for $68. I was a bit disappointed since I remember loving this place when I went to the Bowery location a few years ago. The tuna didn't taste fresh and my friend's wagyu piece was too chewy she had to spit it out. Our server was super nice though and got my friend an extra piece. He also constantly checked in with us throughout the whole dinner. I didn't feel full even after getting the salmon crispy rice (which was yummy by the way and my favorite dish of the night by far!). For the price, I think I would prefer to just go to a regular sushi place."

Keep in mins this is a 45mins omakase, but if you are a fast eater like me, this should not be a problem. Me and my guest were in and out within 35mins and it did not feel rushed. We had time to take tons of pictures and enjoy each piece. They have an a la carte menu available, but by doing Â the omakase, you definitely save a lot. The total for all the pieces we got was $98 (a la carte) and with the omakase it was $58. All pieces were good, fresh tasting (no fishy taste) and each had a different twist (toppings, torched&smoky, etc). My favorite were the artic char and the sea bream. The service was attentive, good and fast. The chef kept the pieces going even though the bar was full (on a Saturday at 1pm! Make your reservations just in case). Overall, I had a great experience and will definitely come back!"
1966,dzwa-zvkW6L2ZUGyNGrmuA,5/3/2022,2 star rating,"This place is better off being a regular sushi place rather than for omakase. Omakase is obviously better experienced sitting at the sushi counter but besides that, the sushi served was mediocre. There are better omakase experiences in the city for the same price. The craft of the pieces were okay but the fish was small. I expected to be served uni or squid pieces but the sushi pieces were that of normal sushi pieces you would get for plain nigiri. However, the waiter and host were very nice and great. The hot sake was delicious and sweet and paired well as a pallet cleanser. Side note, we ordered the miso soup and asked for a spoon and was told they don't have spoons and to drink from the bowl. Very traditional, I like the creativeness to produce less dishes!"
1967,dzwa-zvkW6L2ZUGyNGrmuA,3/20/2022,4 star rating,Overall a great omakase experience. We decided on the 12 piece course and enjoyed every one of them! 45 mins was enough time too.

Brandon was also very knowledgeable and made our meal memorable with his own recommendations. It was so nice to get his take on things and get to try crispy rice, which we had never had before.

It does feel a bit rapid fire with the 30 minute restriction but there was no one with a reservation after us so they were kind enough to let us just stay and hang out to finish our sake until they closed, which was amazing. Also big shout out to the service - they were super kind, friendly, and interactive, which just made the whole experience that much better.Could not recommend this place enough!"

Told me it will be ready in 10-15min. My husband was waiting for over an hour for the food to be ready. We had to leave they were taking so long as we had a crying baby in the car. Such a waste, their food isn't worth waiting an hour for a simple pasta dish. Oh and because I ordered GF they said they make it ""from scratch and it takes a long time to make"". I can make it home for 8/9mins. Won't be ordering from here again. And I've been a customer for 10+ years. This isn't the first time they messed up on my order. Over them."

There have been mistakes in the past - food delivered wrong - and I never once turned to publicly air my grievances. That ends now. In today's day and age, when a business (sales or service) makes an honest (or careless) mistake, just apologize and correct. Details:I ordered a sandwich from a restaurant which is our family's ""go to"" place last night. Â We were coming home from the vet with our dog around 11. I specifically ordered my sandwich without peppers because I'm allergic (mouth sores, bloody gums, Â rash, Â and terrible stomach pains) (See below). My sandwich arrived around 1030pm with lots of peppers. When I got home and went to eat, I saw this - but the restaurant was now closed. I therefore took a picture at 1110pm. (See below)Took a picture at 1110pm. This afternoon, I called the restaurant to ask for a credit since I can't eat the sandwich.Right away, the first thing the young girl on the phone asked me was ""why did you wait till today to call?"" in the tone which implies I was either trying to missile them out of a free meal or that I was an idiot. Even after I explained that I received my meal after 10pm and that I did not sit down to eat it till I got home, and by then the restaurant was closed - she brushed off my answer. She failed to say the following: ""I'm sorry. Let me get your name to investigate. We will make it right of course!"" She made me aware that she had to consult with a manager, who was not there now - and would be back in an hour (what kind of restaurant has a manager that leaves the premises for an hour?) Â She reiterated that she couldn't tell me if they'd give me a credit.... really ... that's pretty sad.Her explanation - Â ""it's not like we can take it back now a day later"". Was this going to be served to someone else had I managed to get it back to them before closing time? What kind of answer is that?Now this goes on yelp, and opentable. I'll tell you - I order from this restaurant because I enjoy the food but I won't eat in the restaurant because they have young kids manning the table. You ask for parmesan cheese - you have to wait because some young kid is texting his or her significant other."

Their food is phenomenal and plesss know this review is based on their service for delivery/takeaway and is one of the worst in this area. Whether you call for delivery or place through a service like seamless or grubhub, you'll be met with the following mistakes; Mistakes that happen numerous times. - your order will be wrong (ask for whole wheat, you're sent regular), you address and get an apology (no offer to correct it?)- you ask about that status of an order, you're told it's on it's way. You call again and again (1:55 minutes from ordering and 55min late), no apology just that they have a lot of tickets and posh blame from one person to the other- you ask for a manger, you're hung up on, you call back and again placed on hold to then be hung up on- the young ladies you speak to are unapologetic, offer excuse after excuse, and get hung up on againI'm personally in the service industry and there are just no excuses that justify these mishaps. So a few words of advice to management: - get better delivery drivers if that's the source of your problem for food coming late- get a better handle on firing food timing vs delivery driver availability- get better take-out/counter staff as they pass blame on everyone else (if it's not the person handling the tickets, it's the cook or the driver)- LISTEN to your customers if they complain (within reason)- Don't make excuses, just apologize and take the extra step to rectify issues if they're consistently made. Sorry DAmore, we bid you farewell because we've just had enough of the poor customer service."

Our bruschetta appetizer had a HAIR in it. Waiter was embarrassed and apologetic. He gave us a new one; I would have rather a refund, but OK, I didn't fight it.Our food was mediocre.

He wanted to visit a jazz club while we were in NY (I think watching Disney's Soul led to that), so we grabbed tickets to whatever happened to be playing the night we had free while in town. The show was amazing and the food was quite good too. Only gripe is that the wine glasses are kind of small for the price, but that's to be expected in a bar around that area. The venue has a very ""old school"" feeling. You walk in to a small black room where the hostess checks for your reservation (and vaccination card as well), then you're shown through another door to your table. I was only in the upstairs area, so I can't speak to the theater in the basement. The seating area is tiered in 3 levels, and the tables are sat based on when you arrive. We were in the 3rd level, but there's no trouble seeing or hearing anything. There's also a bar where you can sit as well. We will absolutely be visiting again the next time we're in town."

1982,XYyIWs-3J4bZRZDfcsMquQ,2/13/2023,5 star rating,"Incredible time experiencing Birdland for the first time. Such an amazingly intimate setting and aura watching some super talented musicians. Only other jazz bar/club I've been to in Manhattan is Dizzy's Club in Upper Manhattan right off of Columbus Circle at Lincoln Center. Birdland is def comparable to Dizzy's but better in a couple of ways in my opinion. First, the venue is smaller and therefore more intimate. Second, unlike at Dizzy's, a party of 2 has the table to themselves. We did not try the food at Birdland but with our wandering eyes the food looked mediocre at best. The Fried Chicken seemed to be a popular choice. But that's not why you go to Birdland. You go to see amazing musicians do what they do best. We had the privilege of seeing Melissa Ericco and her ""A Noir Romance"" show in the Birdland Theater section/level of the club. She and the Quintet along with an additional guest trumpet player put on a remarkable performance that included some story-telling describing the inspiration and feelings behind the Noir theme. The music was inspired from Noir films of the 1940's and 1950's NYC and Ericco's album ""Out Of The Dark."" Ericco portrayed a femme-fatale of sorts canvassing her way through a scandalous underground world full of heartbreak, grime and trouble. And she absolutely nailed it. Couple that with her amazing voice and the other musicians and it made for a truly memorable night. My advice would be to eat and drink somewhere else beforehand. Carmine's is right down the block and that's what we did. Seating for Birdland is first come first serve and we got in line around 7:30 PM for the 8:30 PM show and were able to grab a perfect table in the 2nd row right in the middle of the stage. Servers were great. There is a minimum of $20 per person per set/show. Since we ate and drank beforehand, we ordered 2 large bottles of still water and dessert to cover the additional $20 minimum per person. A piece of Blueberry Apple Crumble and a Peach Cobbler. Both with a scoop of Ice-Cream. They were decent. Will def return to the Birdland Jazz Club. Highly recommend to anyone who loves music, especially Jazz."

There might be two menus depending upon which theater you sit in because the one we got was slightly different than what I was anticipating. That's not why I gave it 4 stars though. I gave it four because the food wasn't great for the prices and the $20 minimum. Virgin drinks are the same price as alcoholic drinks which is wrong IMOOur food was bland and defiantly not Cajun.

I've been here for dimsum before and it wasn't a good experience because we were in a room downstairs and the carts barely walked by so it was hard to get food. Dinner was a great experience though! We called in advance for a room and reserved a Peking duck. The quail here is sooo good. Juicy and flavorful. The rooms here are pleasant! Each room has some decorations along with a ktv machine. Unfortunately the night I went, the machine was down so we couldn't sing our hearts out. All the dishes were reasonably priced and tasted good. I highly recommend the tofu with stir fried vegetables and quail as those two were my favorite from the night! The sweet and sour pork chops were also really good too! We also got the lobster with Lo mein and that was delicious! The servers kept coming in to replenish our dirty plates and brought in extra ice buckets for us! For dessert we had oranges and red bean savory soup."

Downside is having to pay for each individual bowl of rice. I'm used to Chinese places giving you a bucket of rice for free. (Apparently this is an east coast thing.)Also comes with free appetizers (peanuts, pickled radish, and chicken feet). Would recommend:-garlic chicken -black pepper short rib (so big!

We then got this chicken soup that took a day for them to make. The soup was really good. The rest of the dishes was pretty standard. Another dish that stood out to me is the stew duck dish. But apart from that it was pretty standard. Some dish better than the rest. At the end we got our standard dessert. Sweet bean soup and oranges."

This review is just for their dim sum experience. I have not been here for dinner. First things first, get the Liu Sa Bao, salted egg yolk lava bun. They make a limited amount of this at a time. They come out piping fresh so keep an eye for it when the dim sum chef brings it out from the kitchen. It's one of their most popular dim sum item. *Warning, the 'lava' is hot and will get messy. Most of their dimsum is good, nothing extraordinary and nothing bad so far. I like their rice rolls, its so soft when it's fresh but off the cart is cool too. I enjoy it when the skin is smooth and thin. The texture and consistency is pretty good.If you ever come late, as in between the hours of 1:30pm - 3pm, there will be limited fresh and/or specialty items but you can request for the steamed dim sum to be made. They have a menu of rice and noodle dishes made fresh to order. There's meter parking all along 20th ave and plenty of free parking spots along the side streets."
1995,sswuN6W-p8wpIeQIoGuHmQ,2/1/2019,5 star rating,"This is my family's new favorite dim sum restaurant, and there is SO much to love about this place. I have no clue why it has anything less than 5 stars - maybe the wait? But that's how you know it's good :p On weekends, the line is typical - usually at least an hour wait unless you show up right when it opens. They have an interesting system in which they have tables semi-reserved for large groups, so a group of 8 would be able to get a table before a group of 3-4 (the most common number). On weekdays, there isn't much of a wait at all at any time! The food is all fantastic, and so is the service. On the one occasion we got a shrimp cheung fun with dried out skin, the manager immediately replaced it with a fresh one, explained what had happened and apologized for it. Other than that one food blip, you can tell by my check-ins and pictures that I love all the food I get here. The shumai, tripe, shrimp stuffed eggplant, beef short ribs, etc. are all really great. Their star, however, is their lao sah bao (sorry for butchering cantonese pinyin). You have to get them fresh - they're perfection with their toasty tasty exterior and the glorious ooze of warm golden salty egg custard. No matter how full I am, I always make room for those.They also have a huge variety of beautiful vegetarian dim sum in the form of pretty flamingoes or decorated mushroom baos; too bad I love meat too much to try those. I def wanna bring my vegetarian friends here though - it's definitely worth traveling for."
1996,sswuN6W-p8wpIeQIoGuHmQ,2/18/2020,3 star rating,Food was not bad but ther service was not good. They didn't have enough waiters or waitress to serve and not enough dimsum carts were going around. So not much food was available.

Definitely recommend the Chinese Eggplant & Fried Tofu with Thai sweet-spicy chili, Â Fried shallot & spicy pepper on King Crab and Lobster from the seafood selection. Dim Sim is amazing especially when you sit close to the kitchen when the come out hot and steaming from shrimp dumpling (har kow), radish cake, rice roll with shrimp, beef, fried dough crueller or cilantro with sweet soy.The great thing is it located on N train 20th Ave and the restaurant is just a few steps away.

Food is pretty standard, nothing particular stood out compared to other Chinese restaurants. My relatives picked this place for dinner on a Saturday night and arrived around 7pm. We were told we wouldn't be able to get seated until 8pm, since they had 2 events going on simultaneously. If you were looking to grab dinner here, I would suggest calling ahead of time in case someone has reserved the place.

It was probably the most spacious restaurant I ate at during my last trip. Divided into a small area for quick to go orders. A counter to walk up to, and get coffee, pastries, or sandwiches to go. We chose to sit down area and ordered breakfast from a full menu with table service. I'm always in the mood for a croque madam / monsieur. Â Their's was a nice portion including a side salad. But it lacked the creamy cheesy goodness and country style bread that I miss in a European plate. The avocado toast was also a decent portion. The restaurant was clean and service good. Less crowded and quiet."

Erica goes far and above whatever her paygrade is. She handled inside and outside this morning. She was the only server on duty and she handled everything with a smile. She was not stressed, she was cool, calm and collective. And on top of that, she has an incredibly high level of energy and personality. If it was not for Erica, this business would suffer. If I was a business owner in any type of business, Erica would be my choice in any position. Â As far as the food, it was good. But if not for Erica, I'm not sure I would consider going back.

Â However, real Pad Thai is like, 1000 calories, and I have to fit into that bikini...someday...so I got the Zucchini Noodles Pad Thai from Le Pain Quotidien today. Â Is this Zoodle Pad Thai a good replacement for real Pad Thai? Â I tried to search for the answer before I ordered it but couldn't find any reviews. Â Well, the dressing tastes like pad Thai, but they need to provide more dressing. Â Also, the Zoodles should be cooked. Â Who likes raw zucchini? Â Doesn't even resemble noodles. Â Also, they put too much arugula in there. Â Arugula, like kale, needs to be massaged and dressed to taste good. Â So, 4 stars for creativity and taste of the dressing that is kind of like Pad Thai. Â 1 star off due to not cooking the zoodles (perhaps they should cook it with Pad Thai sauce, that would be awesome)."

Also had an open feeling with glass all around and the Spring Sun coming in.It was a welcoming atmosphere with individual tables and a very long communal table. I was sat in the middle of the communal table, across a mother and her two young children. I say hello and was answered. There was a group of 8 plus young people to my right. Another woman across on the far left. The mother and her children left shortly, and almost immediately, a woman came and sat there with her notepad. We chit chatted a bit.The place was bustling with activity. The table had flower arrangements, condiments. Cheerful! I opted for the Croque Monsieur and Belgian Hot Chocolate.The Sandwich came perfectly grilled outside and served with a mustard sampling cup and salad.It was delicious.The Belgian Hot Chocolate is a big bowl of warm milk with a tiny container of dark chocolate to add to taste.Too bad I had to run to a play, otherwise, I had lingered a bit.A blackboard showcased the Spring Menu"

This is one of my favorite places for brunch, the atmosphere has a nice and warm vibe, not too crowded and never too loud. Service is always friendly and efficient, and the food is great!

We enjoyed some brunch items and some pasta/lunch items. The breakfast pizza was amazing and a huge portion. Â Basically all the fixings on soft pizza dough. The Hell egg breakfast item has a kick but really tasty. Salmon Benedict was a very healthy portion and perfectly executed. We also had two pasta dishes that were tasty. A great visit and experience."
2012,Y9ZC2tx4ReQqA40LEPErwQ,11/11/2022,4 star rating,My friend and I had a very enjoyable brunch here a few weeks ago. There were no reservations available but it wasn't an issue walking in and getting a table for 2 at 1 on a Saturday. The food wasn't necessarily the best part. We really liked the restaurant and appreciated how the staff didn't rush us. We started with the donuts. The glaze and the raspberry jelly donut were our favorites out of the 3. Unfortunately I couldn't enjoy my coffee with the donuts. It took me asking for a coffee the times before I finally got one. Our waitress acknowledged there was an issue with the barista and comped the coffee. I had the breakfast pizza as my main. It was okay. I liked how there were multiple eggs.
2013,Y9ZC2tx4ReQqA40LEPErwQ,4/27/2022,4 star rating,"The cacio e pepe is divine. The noodles are perfectly al dente and are coated in a ton of fresh parm cheese. I love cacio e pepe and this might be one of the best that I've had. I'm only knocking off a star because I wish it was bigger (well yes, I always wish I had more pasta) but for the price the portion was skimpy. There were also too many whole peppercorns that should have been ground a bit better. The vibes at Upland are also top notch. It's impossible to snag a table without a reservation, but we were able to post up at the bar which was a win. The bartender was super friendly and pleasant. My husband ordered the jalapeno biscuit egg sammie and really enjoyed it. I definitely have a feeling that you can't go wrong with anything here. I know the pizzas and burgers are super popular.If you are looking for a special occasion spot that isn't too fancy but still feels *special* than I highly suggest Upland."
2014,Y9ZC2tx4ReQqA40LEPErwQ,7/10/2022,3 star rating,"We visited Upland for dinner and had a very mixed experience--great food, a pretty setting, but glacial service.I'll start with the food. Â We started with (what I believe was) the little gem salad, and it was solid overall. Â The cheese was papery and had an odd flavor, but the salad worked as a whole. Â The remaining dishes were stronger. Â The cacio e pepe was very nice, with a perfect balance of pepper--enough for pepper lovers, but not so much that you won't enjoy it if you're not a fan. Â The chicken also had a great flavor, though it could use a bit more sauce. Â (The chicken comes with the whole foot, as an fyi, for the squeamish eaters among us.)On to the more disappointing aspect: The service was exceptionally slow. Â We spent much of the evening waiting for courses and asking each other when they might come, which always detracts from the experience. Â And it took so long that we decided to forego dessert and just got ice cream on the way home. Â Our waiter rarely checked in as well, and although we understand kitchen delays aren't on wait staff, an indication that the food is taking a while or an occasional refill of water can't hurt!Overall, if Upland gets its service back on track, we'd happily go back for the food."
2015,Y9ZC2tx4ReQqA40LEPErwQ,11/18/2022,4 star rating,"After seeing Gigi Hadid rave about Upland's cheeseburger, I knew I had to give it a try myself. Â A solid 4 out of 5, in my opinion. Â One bite and I was taken straight out to California (likely due to the avocado), and the double patty was a nice and unexpected touch. Â However, the bun was a bit too big for comfort, and I ended up not finishing the carbs. Â Their fries were crisp, thin, and nicely seasoned. Â Overall, a solid burger but probably not worth the $28 price tag, in my opinion. Â That being said, it's definitely worth trying at least once!"

2025,l-oj1yA5liiFEEwoi-1ELA,4/11/2018,4 star rating,"Why Chick-fil-A is very dear to my heart even though I disagree with almost everything that comes out of the company's CEO's mouth:1. My first Chick-fil-A experience was at a law school event where I skeptically eyed the misshapen lump and thought to myself that a fried chicken biscuit couldn't possibly taste that good and yet look so ordinary. That was before I took my first bite and instantly wished I could cut the line to get another one. 2. After a very excruciating breakup, my cousin took me to the Chick-fil-A in the one shopping mall in Charlottesville. I was deep in the throes of self-pitying and ordered way too much food for two people. At some point, I looked up from my waffle fries and sweet tea, a changed woman. They say time heals all wounds but maybe it's just that sick feeling of too many waffle fries crowding out the heartache. Always eat the waffle fries first right out of the bag - they get all limp and gross if you let them sit. 3. The people behind the counter at this particular Chick-fil-A are the absolute nicest. I myself might not take too kindly to the midtown lunch crowd but the waitress was so nice, winking and slipping in extra packets of honey roasted BBQ (the best, I refuse to hear anything else). 4. The taste of a Chick-fil-A biscuit, after not having one after however many years have passed, is nostalgia wrapped in foil paper. Always get a side of the chicken nuggets, which beat the pants off of McDonald's. 5. The sausage, egg, and cheese, with a generous dollop of grape jam on the sausage side of the biscuit, is better than any bodega version. Best consumed super early in the morning but not on Sunday mornings. The one downside is that the wait time was just a smidge on the long ""oh my God I need to sprint back"" side."
2026,l-oj1yA5liiFEEwoi-1ELA,4/29/2018,4 star rating,"Overall - Addictively good chicken sandwiches served fastWhat I got - spicy chicken sandwich, waffle fries, simply orange milkshakeTaste -Addicting; although there isn't anything special / unique about the flavor, the spicy chicken sandwich is on point. Cooked to perfection with a pressure cooker. Always juicy and never dried out. There is just the right amount of spicy in the batter so that you can taste it but your mouth isn't burning. I love the waffle fries, somewhere between crispy and soggy. The shakes are surprisingly good. The simply orange flavor was one of my faves because it tasted like an orange creamsicle in a good way and not artificially flavored. They are thicker, have more flavor, and taste way better than what you get at shake shack or in-n-out burger. Their flavors rotate but they always have chocolate / vanilla. Upgrading to deluxe is worth it.Value - Average; $8-$11 for sandwich, fries, and a drink / shake.Service - Counter service but far from what you would expect from a place that is often referred to as a fast food restaurant. The staff is always friendly and smiling and usually reply with a ""my pleasure"" when requesting something. Â Atmosphere - CasualFacility - This location is a new facility so its really nice and clean. Even as it loses that newly remodeled feeling I am sure they will keep it clean like their other locations. Need to know - closed on Sunday, usually when you crave it mostWould I come back - YesWould I go out of my way - YesAdditional info - Chick-Fil-a became one of my goto places to get good chicken fast when I was growing up in Texas.

I came here today because my usual taco truck wasn't there so decided on getting chick fil a for lunch. Pretty clean in here. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich, fries and a three piece chicken strips. Came out to be around 14 bucks so lunch at this price certainly isn't cheap. Make sure to use your chick fil a app because when you scan, you can earn points. The points accumulate for your next reward. I think I each dollar spent is like 10 points and like 500 points gets you a chicken sandwich. When I finished ordering, my order was already ready because I left the counter. So A+ on fast service. Lady was nice and gave me two chick fil a sauce. I also got a free sandwich on the printed receipt once I take their survey. That is pretty awesome.Chicken sandwich was good, chicken strips were good too. I wish their food was a little hotter because it was just warm when I got back to my office. After eating the sandwich and three piece chicken strips and fries, I'm already feeling a little hungry at 12:30. Maybe if they can up their portion for each order that would be cool too."

The second floor had really pretty views looking into the outside of Grand Central. Overall it's still a fast food restaurant but the effort they make with the decor at Chick-Fil-A makes you feel like you're less in a fast food joint. The menu is simple and chicken is always good."

The entire experience is divine, from the decor, service to the food. How perfectly the chef seasoned the dishes makes them a unique existence. The chef used techniques to draw out the best flavor of the best ingredients. The balancing between right amount of sweetness, sourness, and saltiness really helped each dish to shine.  The staff were kind and extremely professional. They were attentive yet gave us sufficient privacy we needed. I won't give out much details about each dish considering spoil alert (also because it's beyond my words). But I highly recommend this experience to treat yourself. I will absolutely return to try their new season menu next time I travel to NYC. Just an FYI, the menu won't leave you hungry, just to alleviate some possible concerns about kaiseki meals portion size."

It's been on my bucket list for a long time and while I still haven't dined in and normally don't write reviews if I've only done takeout or delivery, I recently had a great experience doing takeout at Tsukimi so I wanted to write a review for them to encourage fellow Yelpers to support them at a time when the restaurant industry is having a lot of difficulties. Unlike many restaurants that have started offering outdoor dining Tsukimi has not reopened for outdoor dining at this time, but they are offering their four course Tsukimi At Home dinner menu and Temari Sushi so that you can enjoy Executive Chef Takanori Akiyama's dishes in the comfort of your home. For the month of August the tasting menu comes with Japanese tea (Kagoshima Prefecture's Sakuma Sencha) from Kettl Tea and wagashi (Japanese confectionary) with red bean, coffee, cream cheese and basil. Although we only got the tasting menu and sushi this time they also offer rice bowls with uni and wagyu as well as sake. The staff here is really nice and everything is delicious.

The employees are so friendly and knowledgeable, and provided great recommendations for drinks. Each dish was delicious and left me pleasantly surprised; this was my first time experiencing kaiseki.

Â Pacing of the courses, and progression seemed well thought out.Service was just top notch. Â Attentive without being intrusive.My only complaint is that some of the courses were one biters, wish they were two.

Tsukimi is tucked away on East 10th street in the old Dieci space. The interior looks nothing like it was previously. Whereas Dieci felt a bit cramped, Tsukimi feels roomy and bright. The 12 course kaiseki is served at facing bar seats. The courses are well thought out and very pretty. If you're a fan of the classic egg on egg on egg from Sakamai, then you'll love the new elevated version. Overall the meal was very well paced where you didn't feel rushed nor did you feel like you were bored waiting for the next course. My favorites were the egg on egg on egg, the A5 wagyu, and the ikura rice. You definitely walk out feeling full so that's not a concern. I recommend you check out this hidden gem."

The service was impeccable, the staff was extremely friendly and attentive yet also was great at keeping it subtle (I.e. not in your face). The ambiance is classy and quiet, perfect to come with friends, for a date or just by yourself. Can't wait to come back again and try their next menu!"
2040,ThOqBoltiH9qwHmUsMIt5g,5/22/2014,5 star rating,"As a self-proclaimed frozen yogurt snob, I had doubts about Forty Carrots. I mean, how good could this stuff really be compared to the fro-yo heavy hitters, with their endless rows of toppings and constantly rotating flavors? However, Forty Carrots really holds its own!Stopped by here on a random Tuesday in May-- you know, the kind that is hot and humid and cloudy and sweaty and threatening to rain at any second? Gross, I know. Anyways, the Forty Carrots is on the 2nd floor of Bloomingdales. To get there, you must pass the sparkling marble floors and the sections with tons of shoes, bags and cosmetics all screaming ""BUY ME!!!"". It's a rough road but you'll get there.I ordered a small froyo with plain and sampled some coffee, which was delicious as well! They serve you HUGE portions, which kind of mitigates the sticker shock a little bit. Plus, the seating is tucked away from the shopping and is fairly quiet and secluded, so it's a great space to curl up with a book or just enjoy the bliss of frozen yogurt on a hot day.Five stars in my book! Although I do wish the SoHo location had a couple more flavor options on rotation."
2041,ThOqBoltiH9qwHmUsMIt5g,7/26/2016,4 star rating,"The portions were HUGE so definitely share with a friend. I was a little annoyed that it costs $ for toppings, however, I really liked that they do toppings in between layers. I actually felt like I got my $1's worth. This is a cool spot to stop if you need a break from shopping and or the hustle and bustle of NY."

2043,ThOqBoltiH9qwHmUsMIt5g,3/10/2015,1 star rating,"Frozen yogurt here is NOT good. Not only did it not taste like anything remotely close to yogurt, but it tasted more like blended ice, milk and sugar. I don't understand why the reviews for this place is so high but I deeply regret purchasing the yogurt which is now sitting in my trashcan :( First of all, I bought a cream cheese frozen yogurt and asked for the carrot topping. The guy gave me chocolate chips instead -_- ... I hate sending things back and wasting food so I just took it and paid. Then I started eating it and I couldn't even tell what flavor it was because it had no flavor! On top of that, the chocolate chips weren't even good! How do you screw up chocolate chips? I'll tell you how... by buying cheap ones! Half of my yogurt consisted of chocolate chips so I had to try to eat the bland yogurt and ended up tossing all the other half with the chocolate chips away. At least this place did one good thing for me - I won't be craving frozen yogurt in the near future anymore.."

FYI: Perfect resting spot.They have frozen yogurt, fresh juice & smoothies, soups, salads, sandwiches, and other baked goods. It was 30 minutes till closing and they didn't run out of yogurt or rush anyone out. A small frozen yogurt cost $4.90 including tax. But it's no small it's more like a large. They had plain & coffee and I requested for both flavors. The coffee was amazing and the plain was okay but the two flavors blend well together. The texture is great and after half an hour I wasn't left with a liquidity cup."

Waded through the 2nd floor of Bloomingdale's to find it way at the back (past some tables near the stairs) and handed over $5.44 for regular cake batter. Cashier insisted I not use the chip reader and that I only swipe my CC instead, defeating the purpose). Product was kinda icy but the larger portion than most for the price and the overall flavor saved the experience. (Much smaller flavor roster compared to the UES location)"

Who knew such a ""basic"" roll could be done so well?!I've walked by this restaurant so many times and didn't realize it had been around for so long. Finally got the chance to come here for lunch on a weekday. The lunch specials might be a little pricey (about $17-$20), but the portion is so worth it. I ordered a bento box that came with edamame, salad, pineapple slices, a California roll, and udon noodles in hot broth. I was left feeling super full by the end and didn't even end up finishing the salad/pineapple. The restaurant itself is smallish but cozy and service was good!

We were seated right away and they informed us that they no longer serve alcohol as their licenses are no longer in effect. We ordered the uni appetizer, sashimi salad, shrimp tempura roll, speciality roll (it has uni inside), beef stew Uni appetizer: $15 for one piece of California uni and one piece of Â Hokkaido uni is definitely not worth. It wasn't fresh either.. it came with squid sashimi on the bottom of the bowl as base, but the amount of uni you get in there is just... sad.. Sashimi salad: I liked the salad very much, it came with 2 pieces 3 different fish. Shrimp tempura roll: average, same as other restaurant Specialty roll: just because they had uni in it I'm goin to give this 4.5 stars. Other than that, nothing special Beef stew: the broth was very flavorful but the beef was cooked way too dry. It was actually hard.. hard pass Overall, I wouldn't come back here, the only reason I'm giving this place 3.5 stars is because the service was good.. very attentive. But other than that, hard hard pass"

Service was as kind as ever, and this has been one of my go to places for aburri )seared) sushi. Today, I found my lunch to be not the best tasting fish but also poorly seared. Their sauces were good, but the fish (sable, salmon, yellowtail and blue fin tuna) were all very tough and extremely fishy. Without enough sear, each piece was missing the much needed contrast of warm and charcoaled versus the cool. And the cool pieces of fish were of really low quality, so as to not stand on their own as sushi.Sadly, $57 for four poorly prepared pieces means I won't be back. There are many better options for your time and money."

An absence just doesn't cut it for this particular item. =/(2) Taco w/carnitas was very good. Meat was good, tasty, soft and juicy. This was my favorite taco here.

I only got my drinks because I went back inside and said something about not having my drinks. I waited 40mins for my 2 burgers (2 other people we came with who ordered and paid AFTER me were already almost done with their food) I finally get my burger and of course the order is wrong. I told the server it was wrong and he didn't seem to care and just walked away while I was talking to him so again I had to go inside to tell them it was wrong. $60 for mediocre burgers and a margarita that was too sweet to finish.

The avocado salad (which I've ordered before) came w slices of avocado and nothing else. This was it. I have given up. I gave them other chances because I actually enjoyed their food and would always give them the benefit of the doubt but someone there isn't double checking orders and either the tacos are missing ingredients, the salad is missing lettuce and beverages ordered are forgotten."

I would have given this spot 5 star but I feel there are times its inconsistent so a 4 to 4.5 rating would be best. The issue I get very few times are the bubble they are super hard and not cooked like many other times it's just perfect. As of 2021 they have new promotions where if you buy 3 you get a 4th one for $1 which is kind of cool and we have used it few times Â already If you are trying this for the first time, I would highly recommend trying their classic version bubble tea. Don't go for anything else like coffee or cream pudding etc flavors just order the classic and you can thank me later This is by fat one my of my favorite Bubble Tea spot in Queens, if I could I would order from here rather than other spots because the quality is so much better ..."

And boy was I glad I did! Tiger Sugar is mindblowingly amazing! I got the Black Sugar Boba + Pudding Milk with Cream Mousse ($5.51 + tax), which has become my go-to drink. The drink is very creamy and rich with just the perfect amount of sweetness. I love pudding so the pudding milk is a HUGE bonus because it's just so yummy! I swear, it's like having 2 desserts for the price of one. While it is a bit on the pricey side for bubble tea, it's definitely worth it because it just feels like you're drinking happiness.

2108,N4Pss0mR4ygDOoSRpM2FQA,8/15/2021,1 star rating,"To easily sum it up in one word , it is (Overrated).Tiger Sugar is the TImes Square of Bubble tea in my opinion. It is just like a tourist trap where a ton of people not from Flushing come here to visit and they all get this , because it is everywhere on social media, similar to how a ton of non-native new yorkers go to Times Square, which is also very over-rated/not worth it/ crowded.I never had this drink but years and years went by hearing everywhere online, in person, etc. that this drink is one of the best bubble tea around. Today my curiosity got the best of me, and I came here and got one of the most popular drink (#2 on their menu) ,as well as a group ahead of me.You know those memes where you see a picture of the expected product , and the actual product looking nothing like it... well this drink looked so magical and tiger like in photos , when I got it, it just looked like plain iced coffee (even after shaking it). The flavor ironically , tastes just liked iced coffee too, not good or bad, just plain ol cheap iced coffee. The drink is half ice too on top of that , and apparently you don't get to choose the sizes , as I as well as other people got what seems like a medium size for 6 dollars. Half of the drink is just ice and jelly that doesn't even taste good. The pearls/boba is squishy and low quality.We are talking about Flushing , Flushing is the pinnacle of bubble tea in NYC in my opinion. There are probably 20 other bubble tea spots in the area. I have tried a dozen different spots and this place is nowhere near the top 5 on my list.Just generic, over hyped, and not worth it. If it was not so pumped up everywhere online, I wouldn't rate it as harshly but it really was underwhelming and to top it off, the person at the window gave a group of people their drinks before me and my sister when we came first and our number was ahead of them. And then when I went up after waiting an extra 5 minutes , she said its okay while laughing....instead of saying it was accident???Not coming back."

Everything is perfect from the temperature to the texture to the level of sweetness all of which you can customize to suit your palate. You just go up to the window order what you want and wait a few minutes and enjoy. They also except Apple Pay. The line for this place can get extremely long but luckily every time I've gone there was no line which is awesome.

2112,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,10/25/2015,5 star rating,"One of my favorite bar/all american places in bayridge. Its a very calm place but can also be the eccentric bar loudness depending on where you want to sit. During the warmer seasons they do have an outdoor seating area, and during winter they have the enclosed outside area with ""fake fireplaces"" and pretty lights on the trees...it has heating and airconditioning. Its an all around great spot if your looking for a hotdog and some wings. There hot dogs are absolutley amazing. The bacon wrapped hot dog is my very very happy spot. PICTURE THIS. This crunchy sof on the inside hot dog, wrapped in bacon, which is placed into an ultra fluffy bun. If your not a fan of bacon wrapped hot dogs....Then you can choose from the variety of other hot dogs they have. From classic hot dogs with ketchup and relish to the insanity of a spicy jalapeno dog, with pineapple salsa, and pink sauce which I never ventured upon. Â Those waffle fries.....So good....They were sent from the waffle gds of the french fry family..SOME FOOD I WOULDN'T TRY AGAIN:**The sausages sandwhiches are EH , If your from brooklyn and you know about the feast sausage and peppers this will be a dissapointment. Don't go there for that. Just dont do it. **I have tried the ""hot mess"" whcih is a basket of waffle fries, sweet potato tater tots,chili, cheese, pickled jalapenos, banana peppers,diced white onions, diced tomato, sour cream blah blah blah blah. ITS TOO MUCH OF A MESS FOR ME. It becomes overwhelming and the flavors all dont go together and I would not..ever do that again. They have a very large selection of beer on tap, but when I go there I usually like to go there for the awesome stewarts root beer on draft, which not many places have(free refills). The staff is really friendly, very acommadating, sweet and helpful. Defnitley one of the better bars in bayridge. Go there for a hot dog, waffle fries and some beer, or root beer."

Finally got around to coming here and sadly, the very best thing about it was that its location offers a lovely street side view of my favorite NYC bridge. Â John Travolta as Tony Manero in his iconic polyester three-piece white suit for life. Â And yes, I'm referring to the Verrazano:So anyway, wound up here after two nearby Middle Eastern restaurants we attempted to go to did not work out for various reasons. Â The third time was most definitely not the charm in this case. Tried a range of things, including Fried Brussels Sprouts, a Grilled Chicken Sandwich, a Burger, plus a Veggie Dog, and all of it was bland and boring. Â Each and every bite I took was tinged with regret. As in, ""why am I spending calories and money at this place?"" Â Nothing was outright terrible, but I hated myself for eating it. (When it's bar food done right, which for me, means lots of decadent flavor and expert frying, I have no problem rationalizing the calories). Â It was a Saturday night at around 8:30 when we stopped in. Â Don't know what I expected in terms of ambiance, but it wasn't the quiet, dreary vibe that we encountered. Â Am willing to concede this may have had something to do with the fact that it was a muggy, rainy holiday weekend, but still... Â I'd also been looking forward to dining in the back-garden which is supposedly covered, but I wound up inadvertently sitting in a puddle on one of the benches out there, so some rain clearly snuck in and nobody had bothered to make sure the seating was dry. Â Not cool. Â But hey, stuff happens and had the food been good, this would have been a mere blip for me. Â Another thing that bugged me is the Cocktail Menu, which included several $14 options. Â Really? No way does this spot merit drink prices in that range. My experience sounds very similar to fellow, Yelper John K.'s. Â So in that spirit, am going to paraphrase him give or take with an addendum of my own: Â If I lived in the 'hood, am sure I'd stop in on occasion for a drink sans food, but overall, I just don't get what all the raves are about."

As a random suggestion for a place close to home, my mother in law thought we should finally try this.We started with an IPA the waiter suggested. Stone kept the table busy while we sorted through the menu, we decided to start with the fried brussel sprouts. Now this is one vegetable that I don't have a taste for in any form, but my family thoroughly enjoyed and said that this was actually the best they have had since they last said these are the best brussel sprouts they have had. Entree wise, yard birds everywhere, all fried, no offense, but I can make a really good chicken sandwich at home, so I wasn't interested. What did interest me is one burger that is completely underrated, a bleu cheese burger with bacon and buffalo sauce. A lot of people will tell you that doesn't work, but it was easily the winner today of the days entrees, and only further complete with bacon ranch fries. The bacon on this burger was so thick, its integrity held up against the bread and it was within every bite to the very end.We also tried the buffalo wings and the Seattle Sound hotdog. The buffalo wings were nicely sized, classic buffalo recipe, went down well with the beer. The hotdog however dissapointed me though, I didn't feel like it delivered as heavily as I had expected. The hotdog itself was cooked well, but the type of meat used kind of throws it off and doesn't allow the cream cheese or banana peppers to shine.My only complaint other than that was the time it took for food to come out was a bit lengthy. I was surprised considering the items we had were all things you fry and grill, but you can't take for granted your food being made fresh, so this is really half and half.One night we may head in here again for a cider a burger. I want to try those lemon pepper wings also.Thank you."

I called the place back. I explained this nicely to the boss, how I like the place and their food, but how they needed a new delivery guy. The boss is VERY nice; got on the phone and apologized to me and told me he would have a talk with the guy. In the five times I've ordered, they have put a little too much coconut milk a couple of times in my favorite Thai dish (green curry,) but that's not a big deal for me. That's an easy fix. All you have to do is request a little less and they'll do it for you. What counts is that, overall, their food is good, tastes pretty authentic, and arrives hot, even if you live a good distance away. My green curry is always BURNING hot!! This is a great little Thai place in Brooklyn. :) Edited: Their portion-sizes are HUGE!! My green curry always arrives in a quart-sized container. I love it!! Very good portion-sizes."

I quickly found a parking spot (yes, a non-metered parking spot in Park Slope), grabbed my son and went to get a slice. The spot is quite small, maybe three or four tables. I ordered two cheese slices, which were $3 each (and I am by far NOT complaining about the price of a regular slice, as that is pretty much the going rate around [maybe a little less in different neighborhoods]). The pizza, which was a basic NY style slice was very good (I ordered an additional slice for myself)...cheesy and not too saucy (NY Style should not be overly ""sauced""). The man working was attentive and pleasant. This place isn't a fine dining establishment, its a basic NY style pizzeria...So, the funniest thing about my experience in this place was the sign that displayed the prices and the part of the ""no haggling"". Â Really, Park Slopers #sodisappointed...1. can't a guy make a living...or only you guys get to live in your brownstones...and, 2. do any of you know how much commercial rents are in this City...even a space as small as this pizzeria can have strangling rent...3. you spend $7 on a Vente grande mocha latte frappacino cappuccino fancy coffee that tastes like s&*^ and complain about a $3 slice of cheese pizza...or a $5 slice of ""specialty pizza""...4. this isn't Kansas, or Idaho, or Nebraska,..food costs money in this City...good and bad food cost money...just saying...5. The moral here: LET A GUY live...When I am back in the area and want a quick slice of pizza, I will be sure to stop here."

See below for some of the highlights from our visit.FOOD AND DRINKOk, I admit that we filled ourselves up on Osteria's drinks, amazing appetizers, and their complimentary bread and ricotta & olive oil dip. So, when it came down to entrÃ©es, we only got as far as a primi (Fettuccine alla Bolognese). But everything we tried was super tasty--from the Burrata with Prosciutto to the Cod Croquettes (Fritters) to the aforementoined Fettuccine alla Bolognese.SERVICEService at Osteria 106 is always spot on. In fact, on this first post-pandemic visit, we had the same server we had right before covid hit. She was amazing then, and she was amazing this time--i.e., such great attention to detail and attentiveness!ATMOSPHERE Osteria is a small restaurant with a contemporary bistro sensibility inside. The restaurant has grown to include some outdoor seating since the pandemic, which is good for those not yet ready to eat indoors. However, Â since Tony and I are both vaccinated and felt more protected, we sat indoors on our most recent visit. The interior seemed well ventilated, and the tables were spaced out for social distancing.... so we felt safe. Bottom line = check this place out for a date night if you live nearby. I'm sure you'll have an enjoyable time and taste plenty of yummy food!"

2149,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,10/9/2022,1 star rating,"This place aspires to be a fine Italian but falls far short of the mark. First, my Soundcheck app rated the decibels as LOUD. It was difficult to hear the waitress over the din, and then it seemed she knew nothing of Italian food. Immediately after we ordered she brought four half slices of bread and some crab-flavored butter. At least I think that's what it was, but the busboy came to take it away after only one bite because it seems our pasta dishes were ready instantly and I guess they were eager to have us leave. Well, it was too loud for conversation anyway, so as soon as we'd paid we hightailed it to the Great Hill in Central Park to take in the full moon in a clear sky. Food: average. Service: amateurish and poorly timed. Ambience: None and it's too noisy to hold a conversation. Did I mention it's expensive?"

Definitely recommend the tortellini and seafood pasta. Can't wait to go back and try more dishes...10/10 recommend!"

The restaurant has a nice outdoor dining setup with good protection from the elements which was good because it rained while we were there. The sides were open so there was a nice breeze earlier as well. We had the calamari which was very good, pear salad and tortellini with mushrooms which was excellent. Â The service was great and staff was friendly. We will be back!"
2152,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,7/20/2021,3 star rating,"Good vibes, sweet servers, above average food on the pricier side but nothing spectacular. We got the veal meatballs and that was 10/10 delicious. The marinara sauce was *chef's kiss*I got the Lobster pasta, which was a special of the day. It wasn't amazing, it was alright. And I guess I didn't really expect the pasta to have half a lobster on it. Which I appreciated but also, was not prepared to go through the hassle of de-shelling it. This was probably my bad I assumed otherwise, but I feel like they should let you know when you order that you're in charge of de-shelling yourself. I spent the entire dinner doing that instead of actually enjoying my dinner. This was $38, so I definitely didn't think it was worth that hassle since the taste was okay.My boyfriend got the Duck entree which he thought was Â pretty good, but also not worth $30 in terms of that it didn't blow him away. There was a pear cooked in red wine and that was honestly the highlight of the dish.We ended our dinner with a tiramisu and that was also a solid 4.5/10. The cream was good but it was too overpowering. There wasn't much texture and it wasn't ""juicy"" enough. I've had much better tiramisu at Buonna Notte and Piccola Cuccina. This was disappointing.Overall, I expected the food to be pretty damn good when I'm walking away with a bill of $65 on my end, but it was all very average. Maybe I didn't order the right things but I prefer Fumo especially because they have their $10 pasta specials.I may give this spot another try, but not dying to go back."

Not certain about the severs in the establishment but the bartender definitely had an attitude that is off putting for people that tip and have been nothing but polite. Maybe they are trying to get a ""certain crowd"" Â in the establishment, but it's definitely rude to see in Brooklyn 2021.

I enjoyed the music which was set at an appropriate volume for having a conversation (if i were to have one). More importantly, the nachos were perhaps my favorite vegan nachos in NYC and accompanied by a smooth IPA on draft. The cocktail menu looked creative and promising (although expectedly expensive at $14 ea). The bartender was friendly and helpful and the nachos came out of the kitchen in less than 10 minutes. Can't wait to go back and try some of the other food (or maybe get the nachos again). Nice vibe, highly recommend. Only complaint is I wish it was closer to my apartment."
2158,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,8/30/2019,2 star rating,"Like nails on a chalkboard. This isn't gonna be a good review so let me say something positive first. When you go in there is a upbeat, sorta tropical vibe that gives off a good first impression. It didn't deliver as a restaurant which I will address below but there probably is a way to enjoy a visit. I think if are alone or with one or two friends and you swing by for a drink before dinner (elsewhere) you might enjoy it. I on the other hand did not enjoy the following:- the fully vegan menu is very limited and repetitive. - the chips and the tortillas on the tacos were stale- the server was gentle soul but hit and miss on execution.- the food came out slooow- our water bottle constantly ran dry- the the music was too loud, kept cutting off and kept skipping to a new song before the song ended. This really drove me crazy as I heard the staff complain about it but not actually fix it. - I sat at a table but observed that the bartenders were more interested in talking to each other than the customers. This is a sign of bad training and management. - my mocktail was all ice. I'll stop there. I know the vegans in the world are happy to get a new spot like this and I am bummed it was such a disappointment. Here are a couple more positive lest you think I am trying to stress this place out of spite. They have backyard seating and the bathrooms were clean. The space they are in has a history of failed restaurants. Hopefully they will step up their game a break the streak of failures."

We sat in the backyard which is gorgeous but the indoor seating looked great as well. We all LOVED our vegan tacos. I got the vegan nachos which were great but I definitely recommend adding the tempeh bacon. I think they'd go up a notch in tastiness with refried beans and pickled jalapeÃ±os (maybe the kitchen will test adding these things in the future?!) and I didn't love that the ""cheese"" was so yellow it looked like mustard, but the taste was on point so it's okay. Also one person in our party is sober and she loved one of the mocktails that came with jalapeÃ±os and ginger and the other cocktails were great too. We were celebrating my birthday and they gave me a cupcake to go which was very sweet. All in all a great experience."

He then told me that they did not serve food, but I ordered a drink anyway. My friend texted me that she was running late, so I sipped my Â wine slowly, and quickly fell in love with the place. It has a fabulous play list, and extensive selection of Beer's on tap, and some very good wine.

There are other bakeries in Richmond Hill that are smaller yet so much better. Strawberries used on cheesecake were sour, cookies were really hard. I wouldn't recommend this bakery to anyone. Especially for the price, I would have rather gone to Martha's bakery, Costco, or even Aaron's grocery farms. All in which sell amazing pastries, cookies and desserts. Unfortunately, I was desperate and in need of a few last minute goodies. I won't be returning to this bakery unless there's a dramatic upgrade."

Or I guess, relatively new, since my visits to Kensington are very sporadic.They're a coffee shop with basically every type of drink you could want. I ordered an oat milk iced latte just because I wanted to feel as millennial as humanly possible (and it was delicious). They also offer a wide variety of breakfast pastries and specialty desserts (with fancy French names like dacquoise and gateaux). They're super pretty to look at, but for $5.50 apiece, maybe a more special occasion type of thing. I'll stick to the croissants (and their version of cheddar bay biscuits).The space is lovely, and they have limited laptop hours on weekends, so plan accordingly. Or just stop being a deadbeat and get a dedicated working space, I guess.They also have a monthly dinner menu, so that's a nice option as well."

They do excellent espresso coffees, they have several non-dairy milk options (soy, almond, oat). Coffees and pastries are totally reasonable for what you're getting. And my, my, the pastries. They have everything. Sometimes I cannot pick one, so I buy several. Chocolate croissant? Yes. Almond croissant? Yes. Chocolate almond croissant? Yes... and they usually have vegan and/or gluten free cookies or whatever. The earlier you get there, the more options they have. Except on Mondays when they're closed. Somehow I always try to go there Monday on the way to work and I'm never awake enough to remember...Anyway, I'm not sure what they're doing in terms of meals these days, but in pre-pandemic times they had a full menu of various sandwiches and brunchy things made to order. Salads, quiche. Just delicious. There's a really nice back patio with umbrellas and big tables.They prefer cash but also take cards, and have hand sanitizer."

You get one giant, fluffy, ricotta-filled pancake per order and believe me, there's nothing quite like it. We've been almost every weekend since they've opened and don't plan on stopping anytime soon!Lovely neighborhood coffee shop with great pastries!We've been missing a place like this in the neighborhood, and I'm really glad that we finally have it! The coffee is great, as is the food. Also a huge fan of the decor. The wood tables and chairs give the place a nice warmth, and the general ambience is very peaceful. I wish they had a veggie sandwich without mushrooms or eggplant, but I'll cut them some slack, since they just opened. :D"

They have very tasty pastries but it's their coffee which is their specialties. The avogottoa(not sure exact spelling) but essentially it's a shot of coffee with vanilla ice cream. Its a must have. Their hours are much shorter due to COVID however so make sure to go early so you can be ahead of the lime.Their matcha loaf is really good especially if you love matcha tea. Its not too sweet which I love.

The good news is that riding a bike around the neighborhood is much healthier than sitting on my couch and watching tv all day. The bad news is that I'm Â going out to eat more and allowing myself to get dessert because I just rode my bike and that was hard! That brings us to Der Pioneer. I stopped in here on a Sunday morning around 10 AM. At first, I thought it was your typical run-of-the-mill coffee cafÃ©. Upon first glance, they have a few tables, a bunch of hot and cold drinks and a glass display filled with delicious looking pastries and desserts. My favorite thing was that the people preparing food are in an enclosed see-through room right by the register.Customers are able to watch (and drool) as their items are being prepared.My lady and I ordered at the counter and then realized there was a whole backyard area, which we immediately decided we needed to go to. Whenever I have the chance to sit outside on a nice day I'm there. When eating is involved, the likelihood increases by 1,000.I ordered the huevos rancheros and she had the breakfast sandwich. We both loved our meals. The food was very flavorful and super filling. I'm pretty sure this is impossible, but it tasted like my beans were made by hand. Almost like each bean was hand rolled and injected with love. I don't even like beans that much, but those beans are heaven sent.On the way out, I got a gluten free cranberry chocolate scone and holy shnikies. A gluten free baked good has never, I repeat, never ever tasted as buttery and flakey as this scone of the gods. I highly recommend this place."

I have tried many of their desserts included cookies, sticky buns banana bread and I have never been let down. Certainly somethings are better than others but I think it really depends on your taste. I also once even ordered the sandwiches that were premade to go of chicken salad and it was super tasty on beautiful fresh grainy Â bread."

On Sunday my friend and I arrived towards the end of the day. we got schnitzel, chicken and green bean ""rolls"", pork with pine apple, rice, and the two previously mentioned standards I wish for everyday. Â On top of that, we were offered some fish with a tomato-based sauce which I very happily accepted. I still don't know what kind of fish/dish it was, but it was perfectly cooked, and the sauce was beautiful and savory and wonderful. And still, literally at closing time on a Sunday, the food was fresh and the two people working were kind and generous. You must eat here. I can't even mention the bakery because my hand is cramping and trying to think of more ""delicious/amazing/perfect/etc"" adjectives is difficult. This is the reason I wish I lived in bk."

Diners can choose food from the buffet or made-to-order from the menuWhen I returned to the area to meet a friend after a workout, this was the best choice. Neither of us are vegan, but we wanted a comfortable setting where we could relax and feed our bodies responsibly post-workout. This place was perfectI started with a smoothie called JAGUAR POWER (Almond mylk, pumpkin seed, hemp protein, maca, dark agave, blueberry, banana, vanilla; pinch of salt) which I really enjoyed We shared the following:BEET BURGERJungle Cafe's original beet burger with homemade veganaise, pickle relish, lettuce, tomato and sprouts, served on your choice of organic whole wheat bun or a gluten-free bun JUNGLE BURRITOBlack beans, Mexican rice, seitan, pico de gallo, guacamole, vegan cheese and mixed greens layered in a flour tortilla, served with guacamole and vegan sour creamFirst of all, there's no warning on print (on the menus we were presented with to order from) or from the waiter who took the order about a surcharge to order the gluten-free bun on the beet burger. We were surprised with a $1 fee when the bill arrived (which we didn't bother to dispute)On to the food- the dishes came with a choice of soup or salad. We each decided to get soup which was simple and just right on a cold day.The beet burger patty, although extremely crumbly, with its fixins was quite tasty. For that extra $1 gluten free bun, it seemed like we got a hockey puck instead as the bun was tough - more like a shortbread cookie actually The jungle burrito was really good- can always go for rice and beans. It was hearty, filling, tasty, and just satisfying Too bad for dessert the carrot cake was sold out. We ended up getting the carrot muffin, which is supposed to be similar to the carrot cake San creamy white frosting.. bad choice. Again another brick - so dry. Thankfully we had also ordered the RAW CHOCOLATE MOUSSE which was so much better. The raw chocolate mousse is (per the menu) made with cacao powder, almond mylk, dates, agave, irish moss, vanilla extract, salt, soy lecithin and coconut oil; it's a tiny tiny bit bitter, but rich and moist. It helped end the meal on a positive noteVery glad to see vegan options and that I tried out a few items here that I in general enjoyed"

2259,3_pn5nxp9NuGv7tJ61Mslw,4/25/2021,2 star rating,"The food flavor is good, not the best Colombian I've tried. The food portion is reasonable. The reason for my 2 star is mainly I was kept waiting almost 15 mins for my bill and worst of all I was charged $30 dollars extra. Good thing I caught that, the waitress hovered over me to rush me to pay, but I politely confronted the staff about the miscalculation. Rudely they recalculated and realized their error and grudgingly gave me a half-ass apology. I bet they were just expecting me to hand over my credit card and not check the bill. Aside from that they mislabel their drinks. I ordered a sangrita which is margarita mixed with sangria instead i received a passionfruit flavored sangria. WTF. I drank it anyways I figured Id try something different. Overall I will skip this place in the future. For the rest of you please check your bill before paying I have a feeling this is not the first ""ERROR"" they've committed."

Monday was the day that changed for I was in a state of hunger and had just got off the F train. Best decision I've made this week. The section of Hillside avenue it's on places it in the middle of a hotspot for Indian, Bengali, Pakistani, and Filipino offerings as well as a few Dominican spots. However none of those places were on my mind as I walked inside. When you get a look at their menu, it's pretty expansive, and they offer a lot of choices for a good price. I ordered the fried pork ribs, medium cooked of course. I know from experience that Dominican and Colombian restaurants have somehow perfected the secret art of frying, to get crunchy but flavorful skin combined with tender pork pieces. Their portions are on par with pricing, depending on the choice (keep an eye out on their specials) you'll get a good heaping of rice and beans, a whole Maduro, not cut up and fries if it comes with it. The food was beyond delicious. I was shocked that I got home and it was still hot even with ol man winter trying to freeze my fingers and ears off. Now if they only delivered near me I'd be set."

We're always trying out a new cuisine and thought that we take back to the basics for a chance. She loved it. I had the super bandeja paisa and she had the carne ensebollada. We also ordered the tostones and guac appetizer. First of all, the appetizer was amazing! The guac had chicharron chunks inside of it which added extra flavor. It was hot and fresh, and we could not get enough of it. The tostones were a little bland, but we just put some table salt on them, and that fixed everything. As for our entree, they were amazing too! My girlfriend's steak was cooked really well and the onions added extra flavor. My bandeja had everything that I needed, especially plenty of rice. I love that they gave me avocado without even asking which made all the difference when eating my steak. The beans were regular run of the mill, but they're a classic and can never go wrong with the rice and beans combo, especially when they're combined with some platanos. I like that the place is accessible. My only critique of the place is that the service is somewhat slow. We were there on a Thursday night, and it wasn't busy. But, the service was slow. We had flag down our waitress down a couple of times. Hopefully it was just an off day for her."
2262,3_pn5nxp9NuGv7tJ61Mslw,9/19/2016,2 star rating,"I've had my fair share of Columbian food, but the food here is just not comparable for the price they charge people. I ordered the ""Carne encebollada"" which is number #43 on their take out menu. The dish comes with grilled pork topped with caramelized onions, a piece of maduras (fried plantains), rice and beans, and a salad on the side. This was all for $14 and change with tax included. My first impression as I drug into the meat was that it was a little overcooked. At one point I was wondering if they pre-cooked their meats and just heat it up and served it to me. The meat was chewy and difficult to cut with the crappy plastic utensils I was given. I think without the salsa and caramelized onions, the meat would taste super plain and totally boring. The beans were not crazy salty but they can stand to hold a few pinches. I was definitely glad that I brought along some water because you definitely need some to eat this meal. Overall, the food is just okay, nothing special nor exciting, and I would probably seek out another place to eat around this neighborhood."

The spot is local and it would be exposing my little munchkins to another culture.They put some tables together and we all sat comfortably. The portions are huge. Not too expensive considering how much food you are going to get. I ordered the fillet of fish with french fries and rice. The fish was fried and had a nice crunch. The rice was a nice portion and the fries were cut thick. Very yummy. I had an amazing pepper sauce to put on my fish which I loved.The waitresses were attentive and everyone was welcoming to our class. As a treat they gave everyone a cup of ice cream with sprinkles. My kids loved it. If in the mood for colombian food I'd definitely come back.

Â Like when I call for a sirloin with chimichurri and they repeat it word for word but I end up getting a flat skirt steak with only hot sauce... By the way the chimichurri sauce is what makes this dish good.When I call to question the answer is no we do not have that anymore....but you just repeated my order to me on the phone...I dunno. And to make matters worst the meal sucked, the plantain looked and tasted horrible and the rice has absolutely no taste (like it came from a Chinese store)... perhaps the original chef is no longer there...who knows but the food has taken a serious dive in my opinion."

They taste like they're frozen and heated up (which is prob what they are). I tried them more than once hoping it was just a bad day-- nope! Never add garlic to your pizza, they will just put small mountains of chopped garlic all over it instead of spreading out tiny pieces of garlic. We had to scrape ALL of it off it was disgusting!

But every time we go, we have a weird experience.Once we went and there was no air conditioning, so it was so hot we could barely sit and eat. And the service was really slow so it felt like we were there for eternity in the heat....Another time we went was during covid and we ate outside. The service was also pretty slow and it was pretty quiet, and then the food made us feel kind of sick/bloated right afterwards.I feel like it's a little expensive and we'd probably prefer to spend the money somewhere else. But I gave it 4 starts because it's worth trying and tasting the food at least once. Maybe we just had a few bad experiences but the place is really cute and there aren't many French places in the area."

Escargot--snails: these tasted nice, although it's a fairly small amount of food. Fries were heavily seasoned but I liked them that way. It's pricey, but probably worth it."

2304,V05D4jAQb3rT3WqEBGq-og,7/1/2021,3 star rating,"Wanted to update my review after eating two more times. Ironically never heard cantopop played again. Ate the chicken leg mixed mushroom once and the next time was tomato soup with beef stew.Tomato soup with beef stew was probably worse than the first time. I felt like the soup was even more watery. The beef stew was cold (it was warm the first time). Idk if it's meant to be added to the soup, but I don't want to. Chicken leg mixed mushroom. My friend said it tasted herbally but it reminds me of a super watery chicken coconut soup plus a lot of earthy flavor which is suspect is coming from soil from mushrooms. You can see a lot of floating brown bits throughout and at the bottom of the soup. The soup is very oily too, probably from chicken. The chicken leg isn't a whole leg, a little less than the meat of a whole leg. I like it being boneless but it will look better presentationally to give the whole leg. It's okish tender but the problem is it not being fresh enough, has fridge flavor. Note: I am not saying it's stale. I'm saying it's can be higher quality and more fresh. Â Y'all can read my previous review for a more detailed overview but I noticed more things after going again.This style of noodles isn't novel but it's still a different experience to certain customers. In the process of gaining popularity, you have to accept that there will be completely clueless customers. I noticed that they aren't eager to explain the process to confused customers. They don't take initiative to make their customers feel comfortable in this environment. I disagree that they can't provide this service as a casual eatery. Their style is new to the neighborhood. They're not flexible with swapping ingredients in and out. Logistically I think it's doable considering all the ingredients are plated on the side. Maybe it's something with their ordering system or their inventory control. Not ideal. Don't ask me why I still bother going. My parents choose and I don't want to feed myself. Â They don't have 20% off anymore, only eat 10 get 1 bowl free. Less worth. Idk why my parents bother."

The whole meal was $65 for 4 people including 2 appetizers and tax and tip!!!!! And we gobbled (thanksgiving reference, happy thanksgiving to all those who celebrate). I recommend the original rice noodle, it comes with the beef sliced and i think it tastes better than the bbbbbbbbbbbbbrisket with original (extra b's bc it is indeed chilly outside). Parking is a bit tough just because 86th street is tough and the subway right above does not help, but there are always side streets for you to find parking with a meter. 5/5 i would totallllleeee arrive again"
2306,LfPtY7hYpOsNTaxgfny_hw,6/8/2022,5 star rating,"First off, make sure you come hungry and not after you've eaten a snack. Oh my yum!! My favorite appetizers were the curry fish balls and smashed cucumber salad. The fried wontons were just eh. There was very little filling inside so not worth it. I ordered the R3 and it was so tasty! The portion size is huge and they give a large amount of noodles. Get the dish separate and assemble it yourself since it's more fun that way and bonus, you get to put it on the gram!"

So I ordered fried chicken wings, curry fish balls, fried wonton and taiwan sausages. I loved their fried chicken wings and fried wonton. I like how crispy it was and it was delicious. I loved it. The curry fish ball and taiwan sausages. It was a bit spicy for me. But still very delicious. I would give a rating of Â 4.5 to 5 star."

I typically go to the one at 7th avenue sunset park brooklyn called Western Yunan Crossing Bridge Noodle. The yunnan noodles here was very delicious and I would definitely come back here again. I ordered the Spicy Beef Brisket Rice Noodle but got to try the smashed cucumber salad spicy sauce & the pickled pepper beef rice noodle from my sister. All of the items were so fresh, delicious and exciting (spicy). The spicy cucumber salad at first was not spicy but the spice kicks in afterwards. The cucumbers were very refreshing and well seasoned. The spicy beef brisket rice noodle was spicy and very exciting. The mala sauce gets to you. The soup was delicious and savory. The noodles was al dente and everything in this bowl was heaven! The pickled pepper beef rice noodle was not spicy and pretty good. The broth was savory and of good quality. My favorite was the spicy beef brisket rice noodle because it was exciting to eat it.The shop was very clean, spacious and comfortable. The staff was friendly and attentive. I will come back here soon again!"
2309,LfPtY7hYpOsNTaxgfny_hw,2/28/2022,5 star rating,"Hefty portions with a variety of toppings included in your bowl. You can DIY it like a hot pot or have the servers put it together for you. I recommend having them place it together otherwise your bowl will look like a hot mess (which is why I have no photos!) If you are in the mood for a hot bowl of noodle soup - I would look no further. Ten Seconds has a ton of different options- tomato, original or spicy broth choices to name a few with great quality ingredients. I will definitely be returning to try the other options!"

It was as delicious as my favorite yunnan noodle shop at Sunset Park, Brooklyn (Western Yunan Crossing Bridge Noodle). The shop was very spacious and comfortable, clean and with nice decor. The staff was attentive and friendly.We ordered to share: 1) Smashed cucumber salad with spicy sauce, Â 2) R8 - Pickled Pepper Beef Rice Noodle, 3) R10 - Spicy Beef Brisket Rice Noodle. The spicy cucumber salad was very delicious - the spice sneaks up on you! The cilantro, Â spicy sauce made the crunchy cucumbers so delicious! It was also very refreshing!The R8 (pickled pepper beef rice noodle) was not spicy and amazing! The broth was very tasty, savory and well seasoned! Noodles were of good quality and al dente. I loved it very much!The R10 (spicy beef brisket rice noodle) was amazing also! After a few bites, Â it gets spicy (beware of the bottom of the soup - that's where all the spice is). You can taste the mala. I rarely eat spicy foods, but this one was very delicious and exciting!Highly recommend this place! Delicious noodles & great service!"

2314,LfPtY7hYpOsNTaxgfny_hw,7/1/2021,3 star rating,"Wanted to update my review after eating two more times. Ironically never heard cantopop played again. Ate the chicken leg mixed mushroom once and the next time was tomato soup with beef stew.Tomato soup with beef stew was probably worse than the first time. I felt like the soup was even more watery. The beef stew was cold (it was warm the first time). Idk if it's meant to be added to the soup, but I don't want to. Chicken leg mixed mushroom. My friend said it tasted herbally but it reminds me of a super watery chicken coconut soup plus a lot of earthy flavor which is suspect is coming from soil from mushrooms. You can see a lot of floating brown bits throughout and at the bottom of the soup. The soup is very oily too, probably from chicken. The chicken leg isn't a whole leg, a little less than the meat of a whole leg. I like it being boneless but it will look better presentationally to give the whole leg. It's okish tender but the problem is it not being fresh enough, has fridge flavor. Note: I am not saying it's stale. I'm saying it's can be higher quality and more fresh. Â Y'all can read my previous review for a more detailed overview but I noticed more things after going again.This style of noodles isn't novel but it's still a different experience to certain customers. In the process of gaining popularity, you have to accept that there will be completely clueless customers. I noticed that they aren't eager to explain the process to confused customers. They don't take initiative to make their customers feel comfortable in this environment. I disagree that they can't provide this service as a casual eatery. Their style is new to the neighborhood. They're not flexible with swapping ingredients in and out. Logistically I think it's doable considering all the ingredients are plated on the side. Maybe it's something with their ordering system or their inventory control. Not ideal. Don't ask me why I still bother going. My parents choose and I don't want to feed myself. Â They don't have 20% off anymore, only eat 10 get 1 bowl free. Less worth. Idk why my parents bother."

It was a very cute and quaint wine bar with lots of Italian wine options and delicious pasta. We particularly loved the gnocchi. The place has a very Italian wine bistro atmosphere. But our server Dragana was truly the standout. She was incredibly attentive and kind and gave us some great recommendations.

2319,yvg56iLnpb2cDb1rCZrCUA,7/3/2019,3 star rating,"Service and food preparation are ridiculously slow and delayed, but everything else seems to be working right. Kurant is a cozy neighborhood wine bar with bar, table, and bigger table seating. They have a very detailed wine menu along with tons of food options, ranging from calamari to burgers to salads. I was seated immediately and shared the shrimp tartare and the seared tuna salad. They took forever to arrive - maybe more than thirty minutes - but when they did, they were great. Both dishes are light and fresh. The tartare had a lot of avocado as the base, and the salad had three pieces of tuna on top of greens and sliced avocado. Didn't get any wine, so I can't vouch for that, but everyone seemed to be enjoying. I just wish the server was more present and that the food didn't take so long. Otherwise, it's a cute place to kick back and hang out with others."

2321,yvg56iLnpb2cDb1rCZrCUA,4/18/2019,5 star rating,"First things first. Contrary to what you/I might have read, note the following:Happy hour ends at 7 p.m. and not 8.Select wine is $8 per glass and not $7.Now that I've cleared that up, I/we truly enjoyed my/our first time visit at Kurant.I stumbled upon it on Yelp and was excited to check it out. Everything that was mentioned in other reviews was spot on:*great homey ambiance with exposed brick. Cozy, adorable and welcoming.*amazing music---70's, 80's, contemporary and Motown (hello Aretha Franklin)---need I say more? *attentive service. Never an empty water glass.*really good food/reasonable prices. $90 for 2. Apps/desserts excluded.The menu was diverse from apps & cheese/meat plates to burgers and mains.I think there was something here for everyone.As far as wine, my first glass was a Sauvignon Blanc. I didn't love it at all. Â I quickly switched to a Pinot Grigio for my 2nd glass and it went down way too smoothly. Superb.For main, we chose the salmon burger and pesto pasta. The salmon burger looked amazing and got 2 thumbs up although I didn't try it. My selection was the pesto pasta. I was concerned it might be too creamy but it wasn't. Picture a heavenly, hearty bowl of ziti with 4 jumbo shrimp, grape tomatoes, asparagus enveloped in a pesto coating Â that was ridiculously delicious.The pasta was a good sized portion at $20 while the salmon burger was only $16, served with a choice of plain or garlic friesThe cuisine is American and many plates being served to other tables looked really good. I'd like to try the salmon entree or organic chicken breast next time.We really enjoyed the overall experience at Kurant. Fun, romantic, pleasant or whatever mood you're seeking, Kurant fits the bill. It is your choice with your company.Looking forward to my next visit."

2323,yvg56iLnpb2cDb1rCZrCUA,6/20/2020,5 star rating,"Once again, serendipity.Intent on a specific middle eastern restaurant with a group of hungry NY'ers, we discovered that the published and actual hours of operation differed. Wandering up 2nd Ave, we stumbled upon Kurant.Though the menu was not our first choice, all 5 of us found something appealing, so we entered and ordered.Operated by two bar staff members, they quickly attended to us.Both were smiling, extremely pleasant and patient.After placing our food order, we stuck around for a drink.The bar staff continued to cordially interact with us until the food was ready to go.Then, without cracking her smile, our primary server double checked our order, gave us plenty of utensils and napkins, then sent us on our way.Already after 9, we planned to eat in Central Park, but with a crowd of protestors collected in our path, we opted instead to stop and sit on public benches outside the Apple store, across from the Plaza.I can not speak for my 4 companions fare, but they all reported positively and seemed to enjoy their meals.Mine was excellent.Penne pasta slathered in a tasty pesto with large shrimp and cherry tomatoes.Though it had been sitting in an aluminum container for more than 15 minutes, my dish was still hot and moist; and, somehow the penne was optimally al dente. Despite the pressures of the last 100 days in isolation, the kitchen and bar staff of Kurant stepped up without anxiety or attitude.When table service resumes, I look forward to being treated to another meal with the same friendly service and quality."
2324,yvg56iLnpb2cDb1rCZrCUA,6/4/2021,3 star rating,"I ordered delivery from this place and was very disappointed in the experience. I got the calamari and spinach and artichoke dip. The calamari was decent, a little salty but not bad. My disappointment came with the spinach dip. Instead of putting the dip and chips in separate containers they decided to serve spinach nachos. So when I opened my container there was a glob of spinach dip over chips leaving my chips soggy. The purpose of ordering the dip is to dip. The flavor was good but I just didn't like how it was thrown together"
2325,yvg56iLnpb2cDb1rCZrCUA,8/19/2022,4 star rating,"Dinner with Plant Based Friends led me to Beyond Sushi on 37th Street. The menu was quite robust and I was relieved that we decided to share a few plates to begin. My first sampling was the Glazed Impossible Meatballs. Although I prefer Beyond products when I indulge in the occasional meat alternative, this was delicious. The sambal glaze was divine! The cauliflower wings were tasty, yet how can you go wrong with cauliflower? The assortment of sauces elevated the wings. The Smoked Oyster Mushroom Bao was the showstopper! Melt in your mouth bun with delicate, smoked oyster mushrooms. The accoutrements were so fresh that it cleanser the palate nicely. I wasn't sure how I could possibly have room for more... but I did. My entrees were the Shiitake Truffle Dumplings and Rainbow roll. The combination of shiitake and porcini mushrooms in the perfectly prepared dumplings satisfied this mushroom connoisseur for sure! I probably should have requested an additional side of spicy bean sauce. Perfection! As a former sushi aficionado, I wasn't sure how, or if, I would fully enjoy the rainbow roll with ""tuna"" and zalmon. Boy was I wrong! I only wish I ordered a roll to go! It was almost hard for me to believe this wasn't real tuna and salmon. After indulging this much I couldn't say no to dessert. Black Sesame Avocado Cookie was my choice. I wanted to like the combination of warm cookie and matcha ice cream; sadly, I just couldn't. It was the only disappointment of the evening. Good food and good conversation made this a good night!"

Â The sushi was good - though maybe not amazing, per se. Â The dumplings I had, though, were fantastic. Â Spicy, chili oil and wonderfully filled. Â Not a bad price for everything either.I wish they had more options without cucumbers, but I didn't ask to have them removed. Â I'm just picky and don't like the taste.

Â As a sushi lover, I can safely say that I did not miss fish for a second while eating here.

Â I will make sure to go to all their sister restaurants when we are back in town as well. Â I'm still dreaming about the food here."
2330,yvg56iLnpb2cDb1rCZrCUA,7/19/2022,4 star rating,"What a wonderful experience. Clean, aesthetically pleasing joint. Waiters were nice and the chefs are in an open kitchen right behind you cooking your food! The most surprising piece of this restaurant wasn't even the food. It was the SPEED that our order came up. It wasn't hurry up shrimp, more like hurry up sushi. It was amazing. Our dumplings came out in under 1 minute. Our rolls came out in less than 3 minutes from ordering. That is amazing and good job chefs! We went around 6:30pm so it was crowded dinner time too. We ordered the Five Spice Chick'n Dumplings, Spicy Jackfruit Crab Roll, and the Spicy Tuna Roll.Five Spice Chick'n Dumplings: Mid. 5/10. Would not get again. The dumpling skin was very soggy and based on how fast it came out, it kind of felt like these were already premade and just sitting there. The beyond chick'n tasted good but nothing special. Spicy Jackfruit Crab Roll: YES! 8/10. They finally did it! Would order again 100% For $15, they gave 10 rolls that was a perfect blend of spiciness and flavor. It has white rice, lettuce, spicy jackfruit crab, pickled onions, marinated carrots, avocado, chili strands, ponzu, and toasted cayenne sauce. The beyond crab was actually very tasty and had all the right notes of flavor. GET THIS! Spicy Tuna Roll: Solid. 7/10. Nothing bad about this, but nothing special. I felt like the flavor of the spicy tuna was a little lacking so when I was eating it, I barely tasted the veggie tuna. Overall, I think that everyone should give this place a try, vegetarian or not.FYI: Life hack. Download the ""Seated"" app. Book your reservation through there. Save your receipt at the end and upload it onto the ""Seated"" app. You'll get anywhere from 9-15% back as well as a easy $15 for your first order with the ""Seated"" app. You can use this balance to redeem things like Amazon gift cards, Uber rides, Sbucks, Airbnb's, and more!

2357,okF1w-7gZNy2OB73SsjuYw,4/22/2022,2 star rating,"The only good thing about this place was the music, food was ok, waiters were very negligent and didn't seem to especially care about us for some strange reason even though it wasn't crowded and we were being patient and giving them time. Didn't get a menu for drinks or food until 15mins and we were sitting right at the bar with two bartenders doing everything else but acknowledge us. The one woman we asked for assistance told us we had to wait for a server, we later asked for water and instead of just granting it since it was a water pitcher on opposite side of circular bar, she said we could get it ourselves(she was very rude and aloof). We did order some Brussels sprouts and falafel, both dishes were ok nothing special, I liked that they had vegetarian options though. But the DJ had the place very vibey and good atmosphere! He played all the right songs!! Also the bartender when we asked drink prices told us one price and we saw he charges us $2 more than price of drink. He said it was $11 even though my niece flipped POS machine around it said $9. Which shows how unethical they are in this place. I usually try not to write bad reviews about places because I know it effects business but the owner needs to hire way better bartenders and servers because either they singled us out for no reason or they need to be vetted better. Come for music if need be and leave!"

It's a cool spot to chill out especially since they have games like guess who and Jenga. I like playing their Jenga because of all the weird dares that people have written on the blocks lol. There's also outdoor seating for warmer weather. Wish the crowd was a bit more diverse though.

The food here was amazing, all 3 of us in the party had great things to say. The drinks were also delicious, I got 2 of the lavender gin drinks, the bartenders do a great job. When you order your food, they give you a tarot card with a number on the back and each of us weirdly found comfort Ihe cards we were given. Maybe a coincidence, maybe purposeful.

Â Today it comes in the form of Mac & Cheese.and Brooklyn Public House serves up a nice dish of mac and cheese. Â Lets be real here - its certainly not the best mac out there but it'll do today. Â and its because BPH makes their mac with the Gruyere - that lovely creamy, slightly nutty cheese. It melts well and is just overall real nice on the twisty pasta BPH uses. Â A decent sided dish of mac will run you $11 (at lunch time) and is plenty big enough to fill you up. Â You can add ham or peas (or both I suppose) for $1 each... I asked to add ham and was so underwhelmed by the addition. Â For $1 you get a slice or two of deli ham. Â Bah. I think I was expecting a ham steak diced up... so the super thin slices of deli ham was a bummer. Â If you're torn between ham or no ham - I say skip it. In other food news I can report that the nachos are typical pub nachos. Â With melty bad-for-you cheese with beans and guac among other things. Â And the fries that comes w/ most of the sandwiches are typical pub fries sprinkled with salt. Â Nothing fancy, generic, probably not cut in kitchen fries. But of course they're good. Â B/c most pub food is that good kind of bad, you know?Sooo if you're in the neighborhood and in need of some comfort food then Brooklyn Public House is a good option for you."

For a good evening (or lunch) out for food & drinks with friends or fam if you dont want anything fancy but some excellent food and a good spirit this is a place you can count on.The quinoa and black bean veggie burger is hands down the best veggie burger you will find in Brooklyn (better than Bare) and though I am veg three of my fam members say the fish & chips are too. Good albeit standard Gastropub selection. And the fiery brussel sprouts a nice touch.Service is usually good, though you may get a grumpy server here and there who just seems like he/she is simply dying to get home. But the food and vibe is worth it always anyway. TVs in both the bar and the main dining room so can catch a game as well. Plus 4 outdoor tables in the front when the weather is nice so can still go during covid albeit now space more limited. Though often busy and a reservation could be wise we have never had a prob getting a table (pre Covid). ....but they deliver as well including through Seamless.Appreciate the old school vibe and above all almost depend on that veggie burger now."

Great dÃ©cor and theme, nice lighting, good food....but terrible service.I arrived for dinner with a friend around 6:30pm...it wasn't busy yet, so we got a nice booth table in the back. Our waitress took our drink and food order at the same time. My friend ordered the French Onion Soup as an appetizer, and the Shepherd's Pie for dinner. I ordered the large Mac and Cheese for dinner. About 15 minutes later...nice and quick...the soup came out. Along with some Turkey Chili...which was not ours. So we sent that back. Another 15 minutes went by and the Shepherd's Pie came out. But no Mac and Cheese. And we never saw our waitress at all during this half hour. After some time, I waved down another waitress, asked her about my dinner, and she went to check on it. Clearly it just wasn't put in with the kitchen. It did eventually come out, and it was very tasty...I ate every bite of the creamy spiral pasta. And we did see our waitress again...she kind of apologized, but not really. I'd go back again...but I was really underwhelmed by the service."

The ice's are good too, plus there video game machines in the back, and some nice candy machines for the kids as well, all in all with $10 bucks you'll eat and be happy, with $20 bucks you can ball out eat, play games, and even take some food home.

When I went to pick up my pizza, I was charged for 2 toppings ($3.50 each). I was confused since I just got half and half and assumed that counted as one topping. The cashier told me that even though I got half, it counted as two toppings and that I would have been better off getting both toppings on whole pizza and it would have been the same price. What?! Is this normal pizza topping protocol? I have NEVER heard that logic before and was sorely disappointed in this practice and let them know they should notify the customers when they are ordering that this is how they will be charged. I was not quoted a price when I placed the order and if I had been, would have changed the order. Â An additional few bucks isn't going to kill me, but this practice is not cool.

I had placed an order online at around 2PM and went to pick it up in person, as it's not too far of a walk. They weren't busy when I arrived. The workers there had just finished packing my order of the spicy cumin lamb hand-ripped noodles in regular spice. I had also ordered the sour hawberry tea, which they reminded me to take from the fridge by myself. The lamb was really soft and didn't have a strong pungent lamb taste/smell. The spice was just perfect for someone who can handle a bit of spice, although I felt I could've asked for a higher level of spice. The noodles are quite wide and just thick enough, though difficult to eat after it's chilled, as they're stuck together. But flavors are still great. The numbing spice was something to enjoy. The sour hawberry tea was my favorite part, reminds me something of sour plum tea you'd get from eating hot pot. Also something to enjoy. The slight sourness helps with giving a bigger appetite and washing away the oils so it's not too heavy of a meal. I would stock up on the tea if it cost a bit less, though it's less than the price of a bubble tea. I would definitely come by again and try another dish. For $16 tax included, for a bowl of noodles fit for more than one person and a drink, it's not bad."

Had to get them bring the right one. It was overall good, but could use more Musir and a bit of salt in the yogurt.Kashk-Bademjan: I am not sure what it was, but definitely not the traditional one that is served by every Persian family and restaurant. It was a tomato based bademjan dish. It tasted good but was not what we ordered!!!Dark Chicken Kebob: juicy, full of flavor and delicious. The rice was made to perfection. Combination koobideh kabobs: we ordered one beef and one chicken koobideh. They were both very well prepared. All together their kabobs are great!!Combination lamb and beef koobideh Kebob: another great dish at our table.

The service was not meeting any standards. We ordered Kashk-o-bademjun for our appetizer. Any Iranian knows what is kashkobademjun: it is made of kashk (an Iranian dairy product)+ eggplants+ fried onion and garlic. It came out as eggplant and tomato. This was absolutely not kashk o bademjun. When we mentioned this to our waitress, she said they have two kinds of kashk-o-bademjun: regular and traditional ones and we should have said we want traditional one. We said we want to change this plate and she said they will charge us for a second dish. We decided not to pay for another appetizer and asked her to tell her manager about it. The manager never showed up to give us any explanation. We also ordered lamb koobodeh, beef koobode and Barg kebabs: the food looked good but the taste was an absolute disappointment. The spices were all wrong. This could be an average Mediterranean food but not a persian food. Barg kabab was actually a Chengeh kabab. The lamb koobide had some herbs in it which is not right. Beef koobide tasted more like Kofte! It seems like chef is not fully familiar with Persian culture and they are mixing Turkish/ Arabic/ Iranian foods all together. In short, if you want to have a Persian/Iranian food experience, this is a wrong place for you to go!"

The bread they served was warm and delicious, but quickly got cold and hard. Â For the main course, we ordered the salmon kabob (a specialty) and a lamb and beef koobideh (the lamb is also top notch here). Â Both came with complimentary pea soup. The pea soup was like a warm hug, very nice to have in this cold weather, and full of flavor. The lamb and beef koobideh with the special cherry rice was very well cooked and super juicy. Â The cherry rice was a little bit on the sweet side, so if thats not what youre looking for, try the dill rice.The salmon kabob was amazing. Perfectly flaky, crunchy on the outside. The dill rice had the perfect kick to it and went very well with the salmon.The grilled tomatoes were grilled from the outside, but raw on the inside. Could have been cooked more.

Pre-pandemic, I used to visit a few times a month. Now I get takeout orders almost weekly. The quality of food hasn't changed and is always consistently delicious. They give generous portions in general, especially when it comes to the rice. Almost everything on the menu is delicious - not the biggest fan of their French fries but to be honest, why get French fries at a Persian restaurant when there's all these amazing specialty rices. The tadig is rice-based (not bread-based) and is always the perfect addition to any meal. As a matter of fact, no meal feels complete without it! Their freshly baked bread is even better when dipped in the mast khiar (a yogurt and mint dip) and is highly addicting. Make sure to not fill up on bread because the rest of the food is even more delicious! Top specialty rices:1. Dill rice (Green rice)2. Cherry rice (Albaloo Polo)3. Zereshk PoloMust order: tadig (both the plain and with various stews)Covid dining update: while they still have indoor dining, they also have a heated outdoor dining option large enough for tables of 5-6 people.

Both were actually delicious, especially with the Dukbokki sauce! The Dukbokki is delicious without being too spicy. The sauce that comes with the tonkatsu is always delicious, and is one of the first things that come to mind when I think of Rolly. Unfortunately, the last few times I had it, the meat itself has been a bit dry and the fried batter does not wrap the meat very well. This would probably be better if the sauce was served on the side."

We also phone in our order so it's ready for us to pick up when we arrive. While they are off northern blvd, we have been able to find street parking without hassle each time.Their Kimbab are always made fresh to order, and are so delicious!! My favorite is no. 43 which is the spam, avocado, egg and hot peppers which was highly recommended by the staff. The Rolly Kimbab is also a good choice when unsure as its their namesake. Try their bulgogi Kimbab, it's so good.Their service has been quick and friendly. Â I have observed many pick up orders while waiting so they have a steady stream of customers which means fresh ingredients the neighborhood loves.Come check them out for yourself!"

Note to self: call to place order for easier pickup. Finally made my way into the store and ordered at the counter. Got the Bulgogi Kimbap, Pork Katsu Bento box, Rolly Kimbap, and ham kimbap. Staff informed the wait would be half an hour or more, and I was willing to wait. Pre-made side dishes located at the refrigerator looked good, so got that as well. The wait was close to an hour, and when I inquire about my order the owner hands me my bag, glad I counted my items as I found one Kimbap order was missing. He goes into the kitchen and grabs the missing order left at the back counter. Got home, and devour my kimbaps. The Katsu Bento was worth its price, quantity was huge with a side of Udon noodle soup, that's savory and tasty. I absolutely loved the Rolly kimbap and the side dishes were very yummy. Aside from my missing kimbap order and long wait time, I truly love the food here."

Â It was both savory and spicy.The kids liked the Rolly Kimbab, which is the most basic Kimbab which includes some ham, egg, imitation crab, carrot and radish pickle.The pork cutlet was a little meh mostly because it was a little dry... unfortunately, if it's not fresh out of the fryer, it's not going to have that juicy texture.The Kimbab was freshly prepared to order.

That's a good thing because the restaurant was empty when I came here for lunch. I really like their dÃ©cor, as it doesn't look like a cheap Indian restaurant.The food is always great at Nanking. I had the Kai Chi for appetizer (other places calls them lollipop chicken). They were very good and I couldn't stop eating them, and I'm not ashamed to say that I stole one from my wife's plate. I had the Chicken Tikka Masala with Garlic Naan and both were excellent (just the way I expected). The chicken had a lot of flavor and wasn't crazy spicy. I'm never in the area, but at least now I know where to eat if I'm back in Ozone Park."
2470,dfuedxl8OncQJuF_SWNKig,5/22/2017,3 star rating,"A decent option if you're in the JFK area and are in need of a sit-down dinner. Given the breadth of the menu (spanning Chinese, Thai and Indian) - it's not a surprise that the items are a bit of a hit or miss. The lamb korma and the garlic naan here were the highlight for us - the flavors of the korma were spot on and the garlic naan was doused in garlic, ghee and baked to perfection. The Singapore noodles were also good- the flavors and consistency were pretty much right on.The Chicken Tikka Masala, on the other hand, was not the best ever as some other reviews suggest (esp not at $15!). It was overly sweet and heavy on the tomatoes - I understand each place has its own version of the dish, but this was really out there and not something I could finish. The papaya salad was also oddly (creatively?) prepared. The green papaya wasn't shredded in thin slices - instead, it was chopped like cuts of French fries. As a result, the flavors of the dressing didn't soak into the green papaya and the salad was bland and a difficult to enjoy. The panang curry was also off- it was too heavy on the peanut flavor and lacked the usually more complex curry flavor. The chicken inside the curry was lightly breaded- also strange to my taste buds.Service was great though - relatively fast, attentive and helpful."

Our server was good but we wanted all the food out at the same time and that didn't happen.

Ever since the location in Jackson heights closed down many years back, I don't get a chance to eat it as often as I'd like. This particular location I really enjoyed. The decor was nice, it felt more on the upscale side, without the upscale price.We ordered a variety of appetizers and entrees. The noodles were a bit of a let down. Visually they look very appealing, but there was immediate disappointment after trying a few bites. The winners were the drumsticks of heaven (lollipop chicken), the fried rice, the biriyani, chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo and schezwan lamb. Everyone seemed to enjoy the tom yum soup as well. I got the hot and sour soup which was okay, I remember it being better before.Overall the food was good and flavorful. The only thing our group didn't really like was the noodles. Their Indian food is solid and so is their Asian entrees.P.S.- Don't forget to check in on Yelp for the free Mangotini"

When we called we were told they don't take reservations? We get there and the place is packed. There's only one girl running the entrance and taking orders. One other guy that just seemed confused about everything he was doing. They tell us they have a table some people are about to leave from. We wait for them to clean it and sit. The guy never brings us a menu or a fourth table setting. We finally get the menu and place our order. The wait for the food was ridiculously long. Everyone around us was also waiting forever. The little girl on the next table starts yelling Â to her parents ""I'm hungryyyyy, where's the food??"". The music (song cover versions??) kept annoyingly turning on and off.They bring us our cocktails which were a waste of money because it definitely didn't taste like alchohol was in there. The food comes and there's nothing special about. My brother-in-law tries to order a dessert but they say they don't have bananas to make it. Then at the end they bring you four sad looking strawberries dipped in white chocolate and sprinkles and hand you your bill. No apologies for the wait or terrible atmosphere. Then I noticed they tacked on an 18% gratuity charge on our bill. The bill clearly states that parties of 5 would automatically have the 18% added on but we were a table of 4. When I pointed it out they amended the bill.Seriously, not worth the money or the time. Overall a disappointing experience."

Â There was enough food to feed my whole family, and the flavor of the steak was fantastic. Â I found the plaintain deliciously sweet. Â The only odd thing was sensing bones in my rice and beans. Â Other that, I highly recommend this place."
59,ybQV8joopvU1_gG2RwLRog,11/16/2016,5 star rating,"Love this place! I have had a lot of the dishes here and never a bad one. The food is always delicious. My favorite is the breaded steak and I always ask for the yellow rice instead of the white rice because it's bomb. Speaking of the yellow rice (with chicken) Â I'd have to say it's my second favorite dish. The table service here is also great. I always sit upstairs where the guys are super friendly and very accommodating. Â But for take out I should take off a star but I don't do the take out too often so I didn't. Take out is snotty and gets an attitude for asking about getting pink sauce every single time even though I would (and do) pay extra for it. Just a small glitch though. Ask the waiters and they have no problem getting you some. The best part, it's open 24/7. WOO HOO!! I may just eat here tonight."

I placed a delivery order on GrubHub at 10:39am. - Mushroom, peppers, & onions omelette with an extra egg and cheese- Stella omelette with extra egg- Side order of sausageFirst, the menu does not explain what the Stella omelette was; I was taking a chance since they named the omelette after the restaurant or owner. Also, I ordered sausage since I saw on Yelp people had breakfast sausages and I was craving them. The restaurant also charged a $2 delivery fee. When you add extra cheese, they do not let you choose what kind of cheese. The delivery estimate was 11:10 - 11:20am. At 11:40am, I decided to call the restaurant. The woman who picked up sounded kind (which is why I even gave them a star and also because I can't give 0 star). She apologized for the delay and said she would call the driver and call me back. A few minutes later, I got a call from the driver that he was here. When we opened the containers, we were not able to figure out which omelette which. One looked like it had mushroom, peppers, and onions but no cheese. The other looked like a broccoli & mushroom with cheese omelette (it actually also had a few green peppers as well). I assumed that would be the Stella omelette. Apparently, they either mixed up the additional cheese or I just paid an extra $1 for no reason. My partner is vegetarian so I didn't want to give him my omelette when I wasn't sure what was in it. If any of you know what the Stella omelette is supposed to have, please inform me and the rest of the Yelpers here. I opened the container of sausage. First, it's only one sausage. Second, it was not breakfast sausage; it was a split open hot dog that was burnt to death. No doubt this would be the last time I order from them. Pros:- A kind front desk personCons:- Menu items are not all descriptive- No choice on cheese- $2 delivery charge- Slow delivery- Wrong/Mixed up on order- Hot dog sausage, not breakfast sausage (also super burnt)"

I took one bite and literally tasted blood. However I decided to give it another chance and ordered breakfast a few times and it was pretty good. I've gotten the western omelette which was pretty good, pancakes and bacon are also good and basic egg and cheese on a roll. I guess it's hard to mess up breakfast. However I don't think I would ever order any meal with meat in it because I feel like the rush and leave it uncooked. This must be the case they deliver pretty fast!"

Our waiter was incredibly kind and helpful, recommending a few dishes and suggesting that we order family-style, which is definitely the move. His two recommendations were the Jew egg and the okonomiyaki. Both were delicious but the okonomiyaki was certainly our favorite dish of the entire night. We also shared the lox bowl and the matzoh ball ramen, which were so fun and both packed with flavor. We ended the night with the Japanese sweet potato cheesecake and their apple cake, which I believe was a special. Shalom Japan has one of the coolest cuisine concepts in Brooklyn, if not in New York City at large, and it's definitely worth a visit!"
71,vpkTNjq9dRh9rT3Nh0pe-A,5/26/2022,3 star rating,"Don't get me wrong, the food is 5-star in flavor, but it's quite overpriced, even by NY standards. The challah, which they recommend as a starter, is a whopping $7 and a little smaller than the size of your average donut. Jew-egg is delicious but again, expensive. the asparagus is a standout though! The mains are a little more appropriate in price, but don't quite showcase fusion flavors as much and are hard to distinguish from traditional ramen or mazemen. Oysters were so-so in flavor, overwhelmingly fried in taste more than oyster. Service was fast and friendly, and the restaurant itself is comfortable, seats a good number of people, and not pretentious."
72,vpkTNjq9dRh9rT3Nh0pe-A,2/4/2023,5 star rating,"The one and only downfall this restaurant has is it's size, but that doesn't mean it's worth taking away a star. The quality and the taste of the food is really impeccable. Very inventive mix of cuisines and perfectly executed. The staff are polite, attentive and pleasant. They have rotating specials, tonight it happened to be a scallop dish with shaved fresh black truffles that was delectable. The wagyu pastrami sando and the matzoh ball ramen are what keep us coming back. Just collectively the drinks and every dish we've had thus far are incredible. We've added it to our current rotation of favorites."
73,vpkTNjq9dRh9rT3Nh0pe-A,4/13/2022,4 star rating,"Cute, home-y spot for good comfort food! I came here on a Sunday around 6PM. Yelp had quoted a 40 minute wait time but we were around the corner, so we decided to check it out and it was quite empty. We were seated immediately! The place was super cute and cozy. We ordered a Jew egg, and okonomiyaki, and a special for the night which was a lemon-y fluke. Jew egg was good! It honestly wasn't anything mind blowing and was exactly what I expected to be. Regardless, I enjoyed the flavors and the hummus was really good. I've never been a huge okonomiyaki fan but I found this one, which had pastrami, to be better than the traditional ones I'm used to. My boyfriend also seemed to enjoy this one, and commented how he liked that there was cabbage, so i'd say this one was a win. It was pretty filling too. The fluke was really good. It was fried with some type of crust, and the fish itself was super tender and moist. It came in a lemon sauce with potatoes and asparagus and a few mushrooms. I thought this was a really simple and light dish that I thoroughly enjoyed. Overall, I wouldn't say this place was anything crazy different or insanely unique. Instead, i found this place to have really comforting food with great flavors. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this fusion worked and would definitely visit again!"

My gf and I made a reservation for 8:00 (Friday) and we were seated right away. The waiter took our order right away. It went downhill from here. The service was so slow. It took them over a hour to bring our 2 appetizers (roasted oysters and okonamiyaki). Then it took forever for our lox bowl and matzo ball ramen to come out. Mind you, these are all dishes that are typically brought out quickly anywhere else you go.Roasted oysters - they were okay. It had a strong butter flavor to it and you were able to taste the texture of the oyster okOkonamiyaki - this dish tasted amazing. However way over priced. I believe it was $18. I really liked the crisp on the pancake, I assume it's supposed to resemble lakte. The pastrami in it was good, as was the sauerkraut and I'm typically not a huge sauerkrauts fan.Matza ball ramen - the broth was good but there wasn't nearly enough of it. It tasted like a regular matza ball soup. The matza ball was fine. Nothing special. The foie gras dumpling tasted like a mediocre pork dumpling. Overall, this dish was fine but again, way overpriced. $25 for this????Lox bowl - like the ramen, it was fine. The salmon and ikura were ok, definitely not the freshest. The rice was not cooked well, a little too sticky and didn't have any flavor to it. It was $27. For that price I could've gotten 2 delicious poke bowls elsewhere. Overall, very underwhelming. Maybe go and get the okonamiyaki and leave if you really want to try it."

From across the S. 4th bridge, I was drawn, like a moth to the flame (or a cold person to heat) to the warm glow of bistro lights that crisscross the exterior of Shalom Japan. Stepping in the door, past the Noren, I felt like I was entering a truly unique space. If the name hadn't clued you in, Shalom Japan, is a Jewish and Japanese fusion restaurant; two cuisines I would have never imagined together but could only imagine them in New York. The service was delightful in every way. They were kind, attentive, and quick to offer menu suggestions and alterations for the dietary restrictive (ie, me). Â The music was as soft and soulful as the ambience and quickly placed me and my fiancÃ© into a comfortable trance. I ordered the Lox Bowl, which appeared like a sushi bowl but had the perfect pairing of fried capers and Japanese pickes. My fiancÃ© slurped down the Matzoh Ball Ramen, an amalgamation of Matzoh Balls and ramen noodles in a rich chicken broth. If you're looking for a unique dining experience, please plop yourself into the dreamy realm of Shalom Japan."

We inquired if the kitchen was open or if they were closing down for the night. This was July 4 weekend and we understood if some business closed early. The server told us they were still open and closed at 11. We thought perfect. Our waiter sat us at a table near the back and said he would be back shortly with menus. Our server came back with the menus and asked if we wanted anything to drink while we wait we said water for the table to start. We waited 40 minutes the server never came back,we called another server who appeared to be looking around for something to do, Â and asked if he could take our order because we were ready. He said sure, we start telling him our order and he says its his 3rd day and he has to get a pen and paper to write everything down because he won't remember. Seriously why don't you walk with those things you are a server that should be your number one tool. We ask him if he could locate our server and have him take our order instead.20 min later our orginal server comes over sans drinks and asks us if we are ready to order no Apology for the delay or anything its now 10:29. We tell him our order and guess what he also forgets his pen and paper and has to go get it. He come back and we give him our order. We think ok maybe the food will be worth the wait. Our sever come back at 10:40 with bottles of water that we asked for when we first sat down to tell us that the kitchen is closing and he just found out. The only thing they have are pizza and burgers. Totally ridiculous the server tries to blame the kitchen for telling him at the last minute.

92,Fm2XUIqr62M6IznAS-kJBw,4/3/2018,3 star rating,"Just plain disappointed.I had first eaten at Nuevo Jardin many, many years ago, maybe close to a decade ago and frequented it every so often. However, my time to diversify my tastebuds came along and, well, I stopped going ... until just this past weekend.My wife and I came in on a Saturday afternoon at around 1:30pm and the restaurant was pretty empty, except one large family. The employees here were very friendly from the start of our meal to the end and were prompt with all of our dishes.First, the menu. A majority of the menu is now Asian-based, but there are your Latin American dishes here and there. The pricing is where we really had an issue as there was no entrees below $15. For some reason, I don't recall the restaurant food ever being close to this expensive, but maybe so much time has passed that it rose throughout. Anyhow, since so many entrees were so expensive, we tried to keep the costs down by ordering 2 of the less pricier dishes -- (1) Squid with Rice and Shrimp and (2) Crispy Fried Chicken, Spanish Style, which came with sweet plantains and yellow rice.Unfortunately, the food was just blah. The Squid with Rice and Shrimp was a just gigantic dish of fried black rice with some squid and a few pieces of shrimp mixed in. It literally was really nothing more than a typical dish of fried rice, with a different rice color. For a fried rice, it was nothing spectacular. Our expectations were completely different, but that's the way they made it. Next, the Crispy Fried Chicken arrived with a side of yellow rice and sweet plantains. The fried chicken was comprised of little pieces of regular fried rice. I will say the fried chicken was crispy, but other than that, it was pretty plain. There was no distinctive flavor to it. In addition, the yellow rice was tasteless and needed a ton of sauce to give it some flavor.We really wanted to like the food because the employees were so nice. The servers filled our water often, probably a little too often, but they were always there. We were greeted when we walked in and when we left. However, the lack of good flavor in the food just couldn't be overcome. Everything was just plain and left us wanting more. The restaurant has so much potential with its unique mix of Spanish and Chinese food, but the menu prices are sky high and deterred us from trying things that could have been better. I would have given the restaurant 2 stars, but because they were so friendly I bumped them up to 3."

Avoid this place, Â The wonton soup broth was tasteless and salty, then the wontons were soft and overcooked following up with a strange pork taste and aftertaste. It was like they knew it was bad and tried cram strips of meat and too many scallions on top to compensate. I got a basic general Tso's lunch combo the fried rice was also bland with frozen shrimp and the Tso's sauce also tasted off. My server was not attentive and had on a tv program which looked like the Tv street view of what I'm guessing was a Chinese market but then it switched scenes to firecrackers blowing up in the street which was very loud, constant, and unsettling. I pretty much had to get out of my seat to get them to refill my water so I could wash the foul tastes out of my mouth and I was the only person in the restaurant, makes a lot of sense now."

The chicken with broccoli omg it was hard felt like it was old. and the sesame chicken same and extra sweet. The fried rice was nothing outstanding. The white rice had no latin taste to it for Spanish/chinese this place don't know lost for words. The egg roll tasted old and oily. the good thing was that soup. Paid a good penny for food that took home and won't eat. really sad. The only good thing was the Homemade ice tea. it was so good that I did get a large of and took home. it didn't even make it home. that's how good it was, and maybe that's the only reason I gave it two stars. because of the ice tea. so my friends like I always say keep it tasty my friends and let me know what you think."

The latin or cuban food side of their menu is better than most cuban restaurants you'll ever go to.

This southern restaurant has indoor and out door seating and is very quick to get food out to you. The chicken is stupid good. I tried the chicken sandwich and the spicy level was perfect and the chicken was incredibly juicy. I would not go here if you aren't very hungry because the portions are big and you need to be rolled out if you finish your plate. The margarita is also delish.

We were offered the option of inside or outside, with the sun being our friend we chose to sit outside. We were the first ones in our section which led to the assumption that there won't be much competition for the servers attention... we were dead wrong.We were brought water, menus, and given some time to peruse. Finally we were ready to order and we noticed other patrons joining our section. No worries right, we sat first so it makes logical sense that we'd be served first right. Wrong! Â We ordered the Kale Salad, Fried Green Tomatoes, and the Hopkins to start. Having an appetite for brunch we decided to order entrees as well... why make the sever come back twice right. Oddly our waitress struggled to take our order and we had to repeat it several times. As our sections population grew we noticed that tables that were occupied after us had received their drinks (the same one I ordered) and appetizers (same as ours) before us. Moments later our appetizers arrived but still no drink... like I mentioned before other tables in the same section had theirs. At this point we'd finished our appetizers and had to go back inside to ask about our drink, no explanation, no apology, just ""we'll handle it"". Finally the drink arrived but by this point it's been over 15mins since we finished our appetizers and nobody came to take our dishes... we had to flag someone down to handle this. Beyond frustrated, after seeing the same entrees we ordered be served at other tables in our section... remember I said we were seated first. We asked for the manager and we're told one wasn't available. We asked about the delay and we're told ""we'll handle it"". Shortly after the ""lead server"" came to our table and apologized, noting that all the other staff members are new. He added that the entrees would be out in about 10mins... we asked for the check instead. Not wanting to wait any further, I followed him inside and paid my bill at the very register I encountered this lazy staff.Sidebar, the Fried Green Tomatoes were breaded but flavorless. It was as though it was simply breaded and fried.... No seasoning was present.

I tried the chicken sandwich and the spicy level was perfect and the chicken was incredibly juicy. I would not go here if you aren't very hungry because the portions are big and you need to be rolled out if you finish your plate. The margarita is also delish.

Their branding seemed kind of half assed, there was nothing special about the coffee or service, and they have a sign that says 25c to combine stamp cards. That kind of action seems a bit like nickel and dining in my opinion... combined with the lackluster-ness of the aforementioned points... there are just too many other coffee shops that take precedence!"

Ive been here alot.. its a good place small location but get your yogurt and go. The line could get long in summer hours. However the customer service is great. Do to you being able to try a sample of each yogurt before you choose your flavor is the reason why the line can get long. Ive tried so many flavors with so many different toppings i dont even know what to say in this review..Lol simply put go to pinkberry its a great experince.

But I've often had issues with one of the women working here. Usually, she's just terse and impatient, but today she was so rude that I had to write a review. I was there 3 minutes before opening, and she yelled from the back to read the sign on the door. It pains me to say it - because I love the yogurt and often crave it - but I'm going to try my best not to return here. Hopefully there's another Pinkberry I can get to for those cravings.

149,yBBKdMVbGjSPAgxhDT8zMg,10/6/2019,2 star rating,"The employees there aren't very patient or nice. It feels like they are bothered when people are taking their time choosing toppings or trying to figure out how it works. I also usually get 5-6 toppings without a problem anywhere else but at this location they get bothered when I ask for more than 4. I don't mind if it costs extra but you can at least say that it costs more instead of almost refusing to sell me more. I hope they train their staff better on treating customers with more respect. After all we are giving them business. Also, today was a very chilly day and the AC was blasting in there."

Like I said, it is a great choice for the whole family. Another reason is because there are so many options for toppings. You will love choosing from all the delicious fresh fruit options. Yes you heard right, I said fruit. They do not let you use the restroom so make sure to go before. I still love this place so much Â and you can go there right now and enjoy the deliciousness."

The food tasted saltier and it just doesnt look clean in there. I mean this is just take out so I dont expect any better.

184,S-xUsS4RKzBrOnAjy6lnyA,6/1/2010,3 star rating,"I've had a lot of Chinese food in my life. When I was young and still under the care of my mother, she would sometimes feel tired after a long week of being a single working mother and treat herself to a break from the kitchen. Once in a while, probably at least once a month, she would order from the local Chinese Restaurant. Â My personal favorite as a child was peppered steak, but later in life I move on to other delights such as General Tso's Chicken, or sometimes a taste of Chicken with Broccoli, my brother's favorite. To this day my mom keeps this tradition going, and on those rare occasions I'm visiting home, I get to enjoy this fare: even though she has moved the flavor has stayed the same. The Chinese food industry should be admired for its ability to replicate these signature dishes across the nation, I've had it in New Jersey, Georgia, Wisconsin and yes, here at Wok's in Jackson Heights. If you're looking for something new or even particularly tasty perhaps you should spend a little bit more at one of the many non-Chinese Food Joints or perhaps a real Chinese restaurant. But if you're looking for a taste of tradition, a time capsule of cheap soy sauce and msg, look no further. Woks is your place!"
185,eGIY_25KFspf8KefDQMj-Q,7/3/2022,5 star rating,"I think I found my new favorite NYC restaurant.I came here for dinner yesterday evening after several canceled reservations over the past year, and I'm glad I finally made it. I had heard great things from a family friends who's a regular here (he comes at least twice a month). I had also seen Pastis pop up in lot of celebrity sightings on Deux Moi.We had a 6 pm reservation and I was not expecting the restaurant to be full as most restaurants in the city start to get more busy after 7, but this place was already at capacity almost. Fortunately, they had a lot of wait staff, so I didn't notice a lapse in service. It took a little longer than usual to get our drinks but our food came out pretty quickly.For entrees I had the lobster frites and my boyfriend had the steak frites (filet). Â When I say this was the best lobster frites I've had in my life, this was the BESTTT. Not too long ago I dined at Burger and Lobster where I had an amazing grilled lobster with fries. That lobster was probably a 9.5/10. This was an 11. It was so well seasoned. My tastebuds were in heaven with every bite. The fries were equally amazing. Skinny, salty, crunchy and addictive. It was the perfect meal. My boyfriend also said he loved his steak. He could have done without the gravy on top though.We both agreed that we plan to become regulars here. I can't wait to try their other dishes to see how they measure up. The prices are not prohibitively expensive so I think it's definitely possible to make this a regular outing. I look forward to returning."

I loved living out my sex, and the city experience as a show, filmed a episode here, back in the day. The service was great and the restaurant is it a perfect location near the Highline for you to go and walk off your meal.

My coke was never refilled, which was disappointing. I did appreciate that they let us stay and talk about 30 minutes after we finished eating and they never prompted us to leave or asked for the table. The food here was pretty meh which was disappointing since the reviews on here are so great! I took my coworker and her husband here who were visiting the city from Indiana for the first time. We all ordered the steak, and I have to say that it was pretty chewy. My coworker and her husband both asked for well done and they got pretty red meat; I had asked for medium and mine was on the medium rare side. I felt very bad since it was their first time in New York and I wanted to give them a great dining experience! The fries were pretty good which was the highlight of the meal. I might return to try other items on the menu, but it was definitely a disappointing first experience."

For appetizers, we had some soups, salads, the Mac & cheese, and the ravioli, and they were all smash hits. I was a little surprised that the duck I ordered didn't come with any sides, considering the burger and steak both came with generous sides of delightfully crisp pomme frites. Our server, Jeremy, was a delight and made us feel super welcome. Only drawbacks I saw were small portion sizes & the prices for said portions, but if you're looking for a great place to share bites with friends, this is a wise choice."

The service is on point and the waiters are friendly and efficient. Â The food also delivered. Â  The omelette and artichokes were tasty but the celery root au poivre really stood out. The sauce is delicious and the celery root rounds were cooked well. Â I'd go back for the celery root and the great ambiance.

I'd heard great things about Pastis for quite a while and somehow never had come here until last night for an early dinner. We started with the artichoke hearts and the ravioli, both were incredible. For my entre I had the cheeseburger and my girlfriend had the tuna niscoise salad. The burger was incredible, and although I didn't think the salad looked very good my gf seemed to love it.

You can see them cooking through the window so keep an eye on them!It's Wendy's, don't get tooooo upset if your meal wasn't served well."

Â When my husband returned the first time, he was greeted by a rather unfriendly woman with a tag that read, Elizabeth.

Cons, it was much to cold inside, the TV is on but you can't hear it and they do t have sub captions because there is loud music playing. I sat on a padded booth and the entire booth moved over one foot, because the interior is cold the food gets cold fast, the coffee was only 3/4 full, one baked potato was half the size of the other one, people on drive thru window seem to think they own the lot.

Disappointing to say the least. Just went in for a few frosties after dinner. The place is FILTHY. FOOD AND GARBAGE ALL OVER. Â  Â I counted 9 employees. All kids. Not from this area. All joking and laughing at 8 pm while the place looks like a garbage DUMP. Â Disgusting. What a shame. The Burger King across the street just renovated. Much cleaner. Who ever owns this new Wendy's needs to wake up. This is a nice neighborhood. Clean the place up. And hire some responsible older people who care about cleanliness. Come into your store and look around. Food all over the floor. In the dining area and the kitchen. Disgraceful. No more visiting this Wendy's for me and my family."

I stopped in on a Sunday and they had no pastries left so I can't speak to the food, but only the cold brew. I'm not sure how long the coffee was sitting but it tasted stale and old. I spent $4 for a small cold brew and threw away because of the after taste. It was very underwhelming in terms of caffeine and seems like the water to bean ratio was not used when making. I highly doubt the actually do an overnight bean soak. Will not be back for the coffee."

It's right by the Triborough Bridge dog run and the perfect alternative to nearby Dunkin and Starbucks. Popped in today for some iced coffee and was greeted warmly by the staff (all wearing masks). The inside is intimate but well decorated, with just enough room for a couple window-facing bar seats. Also had two small tables outside for outdoor dining. Coffee tasted great and prices even better. Didn't get anything else but will definitely be back again soon for some matcha and desserts"

It comes with a spicy pineapple salsa and it hits just right with the savory chicken. I highly recommend. Grab a beer while you're here, it's a great compliment with the food."
216,ft4-eCqO3kukSCsOChMV_g,11/25/2020,3 star rating,"Casa Publica offered a pleasant experience. In my opinion, the menu was a bit small for my liking, however I believe it may have been reduced due to covid-19, for more ease of service. The food and drink were delicious, I had enchiladas and a margarita as pictured, but the service was a bit slow and confused at times. I asked a question about contact tracing and received an inadequate answer. Besides that, the outdoor seating area was very enjoyable, and the inside was cleared to make the bathrooms as accessible as possible. This was a very nice eatery but I am wondering if covid restrictions caused some of the imperfections I experienced during my meal."
217,ft4-eCqO3kukSCsOChMV_g,11/12/2021,5 star rating,Made my Sunday. Stopped by here after a walk with my dog. They had a brunch menu and I sat outside. Brought a bowl for my pup with was thoughtful. I ordered a frozen margarita which was delicious and their brisket tacos which I was incredibly pleasantly surprised by how fantastic they were! Highly recommend.
218,ft4-eCqO3kukSCsOChMV_g,2/17/2020,3 star rating,"Casa pÃºblica sits in a prime spot and boasts an authentic feel.I enjoy every time I come here. The margaritas are delicious (especially the cucumber jalapeÃ±o) and it has tasty apps including the acclaimed queso fundido.On my last visit here, I ordered the special, which was a duck breast covered in a red mole sauce. It was deliciously tender and covered in a tasty mole sauce, cooked to perfection.The main issue is that most of the menu comprises of tacos, and most of them are not super memorable. They are tasty for sure, but the menu really needs some more entreÃ©s (platos fuertes), such as the special I tried.Not surprisingly, it is not inexpensive given its Â prime Williamsburg location (two tacos ~$12); however, the service is friendly and attentive . I'd definitely come back for margaritas and small plates, but wish the menu was a little more robust. Overall 3.5 stars."

Our waiter spilled a bunch of Pico de gallo onto my mothers lap. He refused to apologize for it too. Well, as we were cleaning up the salsa, i overheard that same waiter TALKING ABOUT US BEHIND OUR BACKS. The other server he was talking too seemed uncomfortable, i dont blame them. But our server was horrible! I think his name was Isaiah? Regardless, this man should be fired. 1/5, he ruined my experience and i WILL NOT be coming back here."

He went out of his way to ignore us, served the two white women who came in after us first, ignored us some more, FINALLY took our order with an attitude then walks off the bar to chat with the server by the kitchen pass, comes back, adjust his CC tips, looks over this shoulder and rolls his eyes at us and tells us ""oh yea your drinks"" then SLAMS the two glasses on the bar, and makes us the wrong drink. When we tell him this, we get more attitude, and he ignores us again then remakes the drink that only filled up the glass half way and slammed the goddamn glasses infront of us again. Spikey hair goatee douche bag Fuxking disgusting dude. There was no reason for that."
222,ft4-eCqO3kukSCsOChMV_g,8/22/2019,5 star rating,Perfect for a lazy Friday afternoon ( or Thursday after a long day of work which is when I went ) Â nestled in Williamsburg it's structure sits above the street with amazing stucco walls and an open concept with these beautiful French doors as the entrance . The actual space inside is spacious and beautiful decorated with a relaxing ambience.But anyway enough about the construction and decor. Let's talk about the food. Explosive flavors from their drinks and food. I had the jalapeÃ±o margarita it was spicy and super refreshing. The esquite is so delicious like I wish it came in a bigger bowl- the crema with the cotija and Chiles will have you coming back for more. The cochinita was also just as amazing the pork cheeks were so delicious and juicy. Casa Publica is a must visit if you are in Williamsburg and in need of some delicious Mexican flavors.

224,ft4-eCqO3kukSCsOChMV_g,11/20/2021,3 star rating,The food was ok but nothing to write home about -- had the poseles and it was watered down and overly spicy. The autumn salad and Brussels sprouts were ok but the taste was just slightly off and lemonade was not good. Tacos were decent and guacamole was good. Overall just disappointed and don't understand the reviews as was expecting higher quality food.
225,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,8/24/2022,3 star rating,A fun spot for friends and dates! Cool bartenders and a dark place ;). I must say the arcade games are subpar. I wish they had air hockey or something. But very chill vibes
226,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,6/11/2022,3 star rating,"Good drinks, decent enough service. Some of the games are very fun but it does get crowded quickly. My main qualm is it's very loud in there and mostly because of how loud the music is. You'd expect it to be a degree of loud given that it's games but it is above and beyond that. It was hard to hold even a short conversation about what you want to drink or what game you should play next."
227,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,9/25/2022,1 star rating,Don't go here. Period. They have the machines set up where you cannot get a mutiball. Addams family table is the worst. Knowing your getting extra balls and you cannot. What's the point? Trying to beat the table is impossible.
228,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,8/23/2022,1 star rating,This restaurant is very racist toward black people. They let people in with fake IDs before they let us in. We all had a valid passport and they kept saying it was wrong to use a passport and they couldn't accept us. The bouncer was rude and kept yelling at us even tho we made it clear we don't know english. I wouldn't go here if you're a tourist.
229,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,9/23/2021,4 star rating,"I love me a good barcade!! There were several machines dispersed along the walls throughout the rather spacious venue, most of them costing 25 cents or one token (some required 2), and a great selection indeed! I found myself playing Millipede and Ms Pacman the most. I set the high score in fact! I wonder if someone has beaten me by now? In between games, I did try a couple of drinks that were tasty, such as the Jungle Bird and Rutger Sour (cheers Dad!). I can't really speak on the food, but I was able to happily kill a couple of hours in this place. And, I was able to charge my phone on the power strips in between arcade machines! Now there are a couple games I do wish they had -- can't say I know the whole process that goes into which machines they use, but either way it was a great time."
230,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,4/23/2022,2 star rating,"Attempted to order drinks. When the bartender came to me, I pointed to the person who was there before me. They were served. My turn was up! Bartender takes two separate orders that came after me. By the third, I flagged and explained that I was there before the person he was about to serve. With an attitude, he asked, ""Do you want to keep having this conversation, or do you want me to keep making drinks?"" I told him, ""I'd like you to take my order before this next person because I was here before all of them."" He did. Reluctantly. That's upsetting because I tried to be reasonable. Atmosphere is cool!"
231,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,2/14/2023,5 star rating,Excellent place! Very kind and helpful staff. Thanks plenty of games to choose from and a big drink menu. Must visit if you're in the area.
232,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,5/6/2022,3 star rating,"Not really sure how I feel about this. The place was small and packed, I think there was a corporate event happening as I saw some catering plates out. Most of the games were taken and had a line around them. My bf and I sat at the bar and the bartender was immediately rude. I asked him a question and he walked away before answering, then when he came back and I asked again, he answered it in a way that made me feel dumb. My boyfriend wasn't sure what beer he wanted so he tried 2 or 3 and the bartender rolled his eyes whenever he was asked. We were going to order something to eat but nothing really caught our eye. Maybe coming on a less busy night (we came on a Monday so not sure what's less busier than that) would have been better."
233,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,9/19/2021,4 star rating,"First time at this location. Great beer selection (you can see what's on tap on their website before you go) but we opted for a mixed drink. Asked for Casamigos & lemonade. They didn't have lemonade but the bartender was nice enough to say she could create something close enough, and she did. There def could have been a bit more alcohol in it, especially for $14, but overall it was a good drink & we had several rounds. The games were cool and there were good options for everyone (Crazy Taxi, pinball, Mortal Kombat, Donkey Kong, etc) Overall, the vibe here is dope. My only complaint is the music. We spent about 3 hours here and there was never a change in genre. The entire time there was rock/grungy music blasting and it was hard to ignore. There def needs to be more of a variety to cater to all patrons. Despite everything else I liked, this might keep me from coming back. Good music makes everything more enjoyable!"
234,SE7iVxHgqTcKbaRw8MBJWw,5/16/2022,3 star rating,"So the arcade theme bar is always a hit. Especially if you're going for games. They have a good selections for your nostalgic old school moment.However if your going to have food make sure it's actually good. Although that maybe too much to ask for since it is bar food right? Lol well I ordered a Philly cheese steak egg roll. The eggroll didn't have any peppers,Onions, nothing. Completely disgusting to the point that I actually spit it back in a napkin. That should be taken off the menu. I also ordered a grilled chicken Bacon avocado sandwich. You could totally use a lot of avocados at this particular restaurant because the avocados weren't fully ripe yet. But don't trip it still tasted good. The only thing is the bread for the sandwich I did not get the name but it was disgusting. The bread makes Or breaks the sandwich. Yeah you be the judge on that one for yourself. also ordered a cheeseburger sliders Those were pretty good. But I'm glad they were because if you mess up burgers then you really have a problem. However it was a great night the bartender makes strong drinks. That's a definite plus. It's a good chills spot to vibe."

However, myself and several guests were offended by a sign posted on the bar's television (see attached photo). Our friends are saving their hard-earned money for their wedding and everything associated with it, and their celebration was an inappropriate platform to make such a divisive statement. If they wish to lose money by taking such a stand, then they should do it on their own time and not when it affects individuals who have paid good money to host a party at that location. I was happy to support my good friends, but due to the blatant ignorance of said posted signage I will be sure to steer clear of this place in the future."

240,Aa934EMuqCdEV86faZG-0A,4/23/2017,4 star rating,"Easter lunch at Maggie Mays seems like a great idea! It was Hubby's idea to come here and try the lunch specials. He usually comes here with his friend who lives in Bayside. Note: it's cash only place! No cash? No problem because this restaurant not only supplies food and drinks but they supply an ATM machine. They have a garden section at the back too. Can't imagine if they have a jacuzzi there too. That would complete everything. We called to make a reservation and was told it's crowded and table for 2 would be ready around 3. We've been around enough to know not to listen to that and we got it right when we walked in around 1-2 pm and the empty tables are plenty. It could be some people were late or could be they left early but we had no problem getting a table. The hostess showed me 2 tables for 2, one outside in the garden and one inside the restaurant and I picked inside because it was cooler. I had mimosa and chicken salad. My husband had a burger. Chicken salad was pretty good although I didn't finish it all. Chicken strips were cooked well and some had crispy taste in it. Hubby liked his burger a lot. It's not the first time he came here to eat, he bragged about how good the burger is from this restaurant. Too bad I'm not a burger eater. After the meal we received a tiny fruit plate each. Not bad for $15 each, you have a drink, an entree and some fruits. I don't mind coming back here to try their dinner menu."

247,MPV-rSjFjfxJDjOV97NwUw,3/8/2018,4 star rating,"I really loved this place. First and foremost, I need to give a shout out to the wonderful service we had. From the person at the front who welcomed us and offered to take our coats, to each person we passed as we walked through the space to our table, we were greeted warmly by folks who seemed to really enjoy working there.We shared the cream of broccoli soup to begin -- they separated it for us, which was very helpful. Light but flavorful. We then each had a pasta dish -- my partner had the pappardelle alla bolognese and loved it. I had the conchigle with leeks, wild mushroom ragu and ricotta. I didn't love this dish -- but it was really my fault, as I don't LOVE mushrooms, and this is a dish or someone who LOVES mushrooms. The mushrooms in the ragu are a bit too dark/heavy in flavor for my taste. So I pushed them aside, and was treated to the ricotta, and was still happy.We also shared a side dish of the brussels sprouts, which were roasted with maple butter -- outstanding! We didn't have room for dessert, because we had some of the bread at the beginning, but we left very happy. Loved the ambience -- it felt like I was going into a wine cellar or an old speakeasy in the Village, didn't feel Upper East Side-y at all. Perfect for when you have tickets to something at the 92nd Street Y, it's almost exactly across the street on Lexington Ave. Definitely plan to return!"

249,MPV-rSjFjfxJDjOV97NwUw,10/26/2017,5 star rating,"There are so many ways one can describe this High-end Italian restaurant. For me, I will say that I love the chandelier-lit dining room that has a rustic European ambiance with rustic wood floors along with carved out wooden tables. This restaurant appears on a corner of Lexington and East 92nd Street in a very unassuming part of Carnegie Hill stretching into the northern part of the Upper Eastside. My daughter recommended me to this restaurant because she knows that I am always looking for unusual interesting new places that I have never been. Whenever I try an Italian restaurant where I have never eaten before, I usually will ask the owner or server what are their signature pasta dishes. I tend to judge an Italian restaurant by their creative Pasta entrees first. Then the next time I dine at the restaurant, I will try other dishes while slowly learning more about the restaurant and enjoying each choice to its fullest. For my first taste of food at this restaurant, we ordered the half portion of the pappardelle all Bolognese for an entrÃ©e, which was a combination of different meats cooked in a sauce such as veal and beef. It was wonderful and I was also very impressed how the flavors of the meat sauce just burst with flavors with every bite. Â With concluded our meal with a creative fig flavored gelato for desert along with expresso. Although this was just a taste for my first visit, I will be back often. The knowledgeable servers and the chef's passion for creating interesting flavors of Italian dishes will allure me often to this rustic restaurant."

We couldn't decide if we wanted to get apps or not..but we realized that we couldn't say no to the entrees so we skipped the apps and honestly it was a great decision for us. We did get a side as well and only had a little bit to box up for leftovers! #cleanplateclub ! Before I get into details about the food I do want to note that on the menu it does note in fine print at the bottom - ""no cell phones, computers or electronics"" I was able to snap pictures with my camera and enjoy the meal sans phone! It's always nice to live in the moment and I honestly was prepared not to take any pics, but as you can see this food is gorgeous and I had to share it! Okay here's the food details: (**hole this translate well from my insta @evie_eats ) .Strozzapreti pasta, with eggplant, sundried tomatoes, basil and my favorite burrata! I loved the al dente pasta and I really am a fan of eggplant so I kind of had a feeling I would enjoy this one!.Pappardelle alla bolognese- there's something to be said about homemade pasta and Bolognese... THEY ARE DELICIOUS. With a sprinkle of parm. Â on top? Perfect! Definitely a crowd pleaser..Veal Milanese with Aleppo butter, arugula, pickled shallots and caciocavallo- I really was speechless with this one. I love the light salad on top, especially arugula, on top of the thin veal..My sister, who resides in NYC, said we must order: @sfoglia 's chicken al mattone. And wow was that chicken juicy! The lemon on top really complemented the dish and we were fighting over this one at the end. .broccolini - we had to get some more greens in there! It had garlic, and Szechuan peppercorn oil on it. We are garlic lovers so it was enjoyable for sure!..It is on the pricey side, but hey why not treat yourself to some delicious Italian every once and a while right? Stay happy my friends. I can definitely see myself going back for sure! Until next visit I guess #evieeats"
253,MPV-rSjFjfxJDjOV97NwUw,11/17/2019,5 star rating,"Sfoglia is hidden on the corner of 92nd street and Lexington Avenue. It's mermaid green pastel colors complement the gold lettering that is visible from the outside and the restaurant's unassuming presence is highlighted by the opaque curtains running along the windows. However, the glimmering of the gold running along the name of the restaurant signals diners to know that there is a lot more waiting for them inside. Once you enter the restaurant you are welcomed by the host/hostess who shows you to one of the ten or so intimate farmhouse tables. The decor is rustic but juxtaposed with glimmering chandeliers. The atmosphere has an amber glow that provides an enchanted undercurrent that permeates the restaurant making it a perfect location for date night or a special occasion. Once seated, the servers treat you with deference and care. The sensory experience is then elevated when they bring over their complimentary housemade bread. The scent is warm and the bread is hot to the touch. Fresh out of the oven, it's a game of patience. Once you're able to handle the cooked dough in your hands, the perfectly baked crust snaps and the soft yet firm crumb splits and releases some steam. It's served with high quality olive oil-and that's just the complimentary portion of the meal. It's important to note that Sfoglia uses seasonal ingredients of the utmost quality. Because of the care they put into choosing fresh ingredients, their menu changes to reflect the tastes an colors of the season. My husband and I had the delacata squash salad that came with the squash cooked perfectly el dente and the baby kale coated in a light, perfectly balanced vinigrette. We also had the baby clams with cannellini beans and bacon. What else is more to say? It was both decadent, delicious, but still allowed room for our main entree. For the main course I had the parpadelle bolognese and my husband ordered their famous chicken. The parpadelle was pillowy and soft but maintained its shape and texture as it was coated in a delicious sauce made from five quality ingredients- pork, lamb, beef, sausage, and honestly I forgot the 5th, but it was the most elevated meat sauce I've ever had. Ordering chicken sounds simple and ordinary, but the chicken at Sfoglia is on another level. The skin comes out perfectly crispy and once you sink your fork and knife into it starts to come apart. It's tender and bursting wth mediterranean flavor. It's served with a half-lemon and the acid intensifies the chicken's flavor.Sfoglia is the restaurant that makes you slow down and focus on savouring the dining experience. With quality farm fresh ingredients, it not only elevates the food, but the neighborhood too."

Every barista makes up their own rules whether you can pay with cash if the total is under $7.00 or if that's the minimum to pay with a card. And the food and drinks are overpriced. The owner needs to understand this is a neighborhood that's still being gentrified, not the west village! And don't get me started with the use of laptops. You're only allow to use it Â Monday through Friday at a designated table. Now, whenever they have live music during the week, you can't use your laptop. It's ridiculous. They're better off closing and moving to the city since they have so many rules and it's catered to the yuppies. And you're lucky if you get a cool barista. Some of them give poor customer service. You literally don't know what mood they're in depending on the day. Advice to the owner: Train your staff so they can all be on the same page. It reflects poorly on you. Make sure you update the website to not waste people's money and time. This cafe is not ideal for Jackson Heights!"

I was running and I decided to grab a cappuccino and a cheeseboard. I was without a t-shirt, so I decided to sit outside. After 30 minutes of sitting, the manager came in front of my table and loudly told me that I should put on a shirt or should I leave the place. Other customers around listened to him; however, they expressed that there was no problem with being shirtless.I told him I didn't know about the dress code for having coffee in an outdoor cafeteria. I had to leave. The worst experience. I will never come back. I do not recommend this place."
259,8iWto1WAB0eO91Kp-CYu1g,9/15/2021,1 star rating,"This place is catered to the elitists of the neighborhood who think they're too good for deli coffee and Starbucks, when in reality all Espresso77 is a poor cafe with a fancy menu and baristas who don't know what they're doing.The cashier/baristas have huge attitude problems and I have yet to come across a decent employee. Their menu seems highly appealing, but their drinks are atrocious and their indifferent employees probably just like mixing random liquids and calling it a day. The owners never improve their food and menu knowing that the yuppies will continue to support them.This cafe will fit your need if you're passing by Jackson Heights and need a place to sit outside with overpriced coffee, but don't go out of your way to try this place."

My boyfriend and I just looked at each other and proceed to walk outside. My match latte was not even hot, it was warm. My bf ordered a cappuccino and he said he had better.

However, I did not go there to go work on a computer. In fact, I can never work in public because I can only surf/read on my computer when I'm in public as opposed to do some number crunching (personal/professional reference) so I usually like to do it at home on my laptop on my comfy couch. I know I am not a New Yorker so I should really be making fun of the other reviews but omg if you already know about the laptop policy then don't give the place such a bad review - just don't go! But I digress.This is such a cute coffee shop. We were in the neighborhood for a late lunch which turned into a walk around the neighborhood. My cousin wanted to show me where they used to live when they first moved to the area and how the place has been seriously gentrified. She could not recognize any of the streets or the shops. Luckily for us, we stumbled upon this hidden gem of a coffee shop. I absolutely adored the ambience inside and the service was super friendly. I could not believe it. Because I wanted something sweet, I decided to opt for a hot chocolate instead of a latte like I normally do. And what a great decision that was! I ended up getting the chocolate kiss and it was an absolutely delicious drink for the 30 something weather. This Texan was definitely in a chocolate splendor. If I am ever in the area, I am definitely going back!"

Chicken is delicious. Pork is delicious. Risbo Mac and cheese is the only Mac I will eat.

280,MPV-rSjFjfxJDjOV97NwUw,1/19/2023,2 star rating,"I've come to this place a few times. Their drinks are pretty tasty even though they're on the small side. They do sometimes have a little more alcohol than other places which is cool since drinks around here are 13 +. I've always enjoyed their kale salad and I think I had one of their roast chickens which was ok but a bit greasy and salty. So now that I kissed a little toosh let me get to the drama (yet again in NYC). Because if this shiznit happened in the south -- I highly doubt it would go down like this. Basically when I was told that my order was up (since Â we don't even have any Â service of any kind which is fine and I still tip regularly "") the new girl ended up giving Â the duck dish instead of the lamb. I had a client call me and while I was chatting w her, Â I wasn't aware of what I was eating. A few moments later a woman by the name of Brianna came by and said flatly that I was eating the wrong dish. She already had an attitude like I did something or I stole something. The new girl since she was being trained by Brianna was the one that told me my order was up. Brianna wasn't really Â paying attention which is fine but I tried to explain all Â that to this knucklehead that gave me an attitude. I wasn't nice about it but far from raising my vo or yelling. So she said since I ate most of it (haha ok i ate half a leg of what I thought LEG OF LAMb) Â sue me. She then had the nerve to tell me to calm down that I was raising my voice. Â Brianna was defensive the entire time like those in the hood probably would. The manager who also gave me an attitude told me that she was going to give me a new order.... as if she was loaning me a 1000 bucks. So essentially,I had to go and get an attitude with these people about their attitude towards me to get the right dish. Also, this was during the summer. To MANAGMENT, please be sure to cover the foods properly whether it's takeout or dine in because there's flies typically around them. Thanks."

White walls, plants everywhere, and an attractive crowd. Large paintings on the wall reflecting life on the outside, alongside life on the inside. I usually find a seat at the bar. I like to meet people. Lol. They have some really great cocktails but you can concoct your own drink with a mix of spirits with their homemade Â juices. The owner is awesome. Extremely friendly, you'll probably see him running around. I've always had a great time here around great people. It's relaxed and welcoming. They have a nice outdoor space in the back with cushions and pillows everywhere. You can hear the birds sing, take in the air and sip on a cocktail.

Two weeks ago we wanted to get together for brunch. I did a quick search in google for a place serving brunch in Astoria and I found this place.  I was amazed with the quality and the beauty of this place. This place is so charming, inside you feel like a queen and in the outside you would feel you are having tea with the queen.  They are very attentive, very helpful and the service is great. The brunch menu is not big but is good. The mimosas are spectacular! This is one of the places that I can really say that the Mimosas are going to make you tipsy.*Pinnapple Mimosa is the best !

For food, I opted for the Chicken & Not Waffles (w/ pancakes) and my BF got the Chubby Chicken which came with fries. Both plates were pretty big and we were very satisfied with what we got. For my dish, the chicken was fried perfectly and I was so pleased with how big the pancakes were-- both paired well with the hot honey and honey butter they came with. So good! The chubby chicken sandwich also did not disappoint with all the flavors and textures in came with. Overall such a great brunch spot and even just a cafe for a quick coffee!"

I have searched for this amazing dish in several countries (not getting into the debate over origins - I see it as Israeli with roots in North Africa. Not a purity issue). Queen's Room is easily a top five selection!!!The space is very cute and welcoming. The prices are reasonable for the city. And the Shakshuka...Several years ago I spent a week in Israel seeking different kinds of this fabulous mess of eggs, vegies and sauce. My all-time favorite remains Cafe Kaful in Nachalat Binyamin in Tel Aviv (just outise the Carmel Market). They line a straight-sided bowl with a delicious chumus (not pronounces hum-us, that is a layer of earth, not a fabulous spread made from chickpeas) and then filled with shakshuka.Queen's Room is right there with them. The bowl is surrounded with grilled pita wedges - which fits right into this Astoria neighborhood known for amazing Greek restaurants. Then a mound of chumus made with red pepper Â (not too spicy, but you can taste it!) fills the center. The shakshuka tops the chumus, including 2 poached eggs (I asked for and received runny yolks) and bits of feta (another not to Astoria?). And what really finished itt was that the sauce has a generous helping of ras al hanout. If you are not familiar, this is a spice mixture now available from lots of purveyors (I like Pereg or New York Shuk). There is no precision to the mix - it varies by market stall at Machane Yehuda or the Muslim Quarter in Jerusalem or Carmel Market in Tel Aviv. Delicious. Get some and rub it onto a piece of fish before you cool it in a cast iron skillet with spray oil.This was a fantastic shakshuka. I note another reviewer commented on the the ras al hanout, finding it too heavy. I loved it, but some might agree. Of courae that reviewer also suggested the eggs should have been baked rather than poached. Thay makes me wonder if they are confusing shakshuka with flan. I have never met a shakshuka where the eggs did not cook by being poached right in the sauce (or poached in water then added to the sauce).If you want a great shakshuka in a cute space with nice music playing (mellow reggae and soul right now) and really friendly staff, come to the Queen's Room!"

But if you are craving some crispy, flaky empanadas...then you're in luck! Just walk a block down and bam, you just hit the jackpot for a damn good empanada (along with their tangy, sour and spicy hot sauce).It's a small hole-in-the-wall, and as you can probably guess they are best known for their empanadas (each for $1.25 and you can choose from chicken, beef, and cheese). I got my two piping hot empanadas right away, guess they just made a fresh batch! Here's what I had:Beef (carne) empanadaNice crispy shell made from corn based dough, not too thick and not too thin. Beef was well seasoned and fluffy, and the chili/vinegar-based hot sauce is a marriage made in empanada heaven.Cheese (queso) empanadaThe cheese is mozzarella. Imagine a really, really good mozerella stick in the form of an empanada. That's essentially what this is, and I can eat 5 more right now..."

The only item I've ever tried besides the empanadas is the sopa de mondongo, tripe soup, and that was also good but I only had it once. I would have it again. I think this place is underrated for their nice crisp, not too thick, corn masa skinned empanadas. It's soooo good.

If you're planning on dining inside, don't expect to sit down immediately, as they have very little room to accommodate more than 3 tables in their space. The only reason I gave this place 4/5 stars was because they had raised their empanada prices to more than just a dollar, as well as everything else on the menu.

After waiting patiently much longer than we were initially told for a table, we waited about an hour for a waiter to come by and take only half of the tables order. In the middle of taking HALF of the tables order, the two waiters began arguing in the middle of the floor about which one was going to take the other half of the tables order. I'm not sure why they decided to split the table as two separate tables, but our party was left confused, hungry, and unable to order our food since both waiters refused to take our order. Only after we began complaining did we finally get our orders taken. The first half of the table was already ready to order their seconds drinks before my side even ordered.

I stood next to the kitchen and observed every single food worker wearing their masks around their mouths only, but not around their noses. All of the workers' noses were completely exposed and uncovered while they were working closely with the food. When I got home, I called up and spoke with the manager and expressed my concern about him and his workers not wearing their masks properly and how this is extremely dangerous. The manager replied by simply saying, ""Thank you for your concern. God bless you."" He indicated nothing about him changing his ways to wear his mask properly and to instruct his workers to wear their masks properly. I tried to follow up to ask and request this from him, but he hung up on me at this point. WEARING MASKS IMPROPERLY IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND IS PUTTING ALL OF OUR LIVES IN JEOPARDY! WEAR YOUR MASKS PROPERLY!!!!!!!! COVER YOUR MOUTHS AND NOSES!!!!!!!!"

No complaints but this isnt going to be on the zagat guide anytime soon.A positive here is they have parking. So glad we didnt have to find something on the street.

The problem that I have with any establishment in this day and age that negates good food by a terrible service model is probably noteworthy for potential diners and should make you avoid the place.To explain--You will get prices on the steep side for a diner and then the main shake down is in place by landing a 4% charge on all credit cards . On top of that they also take liberties by taking a 16% tip without your agreement in advance of billing. So in summary , the service model employed here by this establishment loads 20% on top of the prices displayed .One establishment to easily avoid by walking another block either way for less stealth charges and saving your family a lot of money."

Â When we tried to flag down a waiter to get some hot sauce and, later, our check, it took way to long to get anyone's attention. Â On top of that, they add an additional charge if you use a credit card. Â In our case it was $1.62 on a $40.00 bill. Â Who does that in a major US city these days?

Â When we got the bill, we saw that the waiter charged us for 3 meals instead of 2 and pretended to be surprised when we called him out on it. Â He then took about 20 minutes to come back with the fixed bill- he seemed like he was taking long on purpose because he kept looking at us. Â We got the feeling that adding random items to the bill is a common practice at this place, so double check your bill if you decide to eat here."

My mom and I were sat next to where the kitchen was there was table next to us and the staff there sat down and started to eat which was great. Until they were staring at us while we ate and making me and my mom uncomfortable. my mom got up to go the bathroom so I was alone they were talking in Spanish about me and the way I looked. I knew what they were saying and It was unheard of. There was probably 6 of the staring at me all at once and Â they just continue to talk about me. That was until I gave them a dirty look and they asked me if I knew Spanish. I said yes and they stopped we left minutes later and I could feel there stares as I got up. I don't wish that experience on anyone. And the food was okay not the best but not bad but definitely not worth what happened.

I called again the number listed on the website and just made note that my order was incorrect. This third party kindly offered apologies and said they would like to compensate for the mistake.

I've always loved how cute it is with a delightful communal table, tiny bar, and now outdoor seating. The ambience makes for a romantic date night or a nice Hell's kitchen stop with a close friend. To drink, of course, there is a nice selection of wines in glass/quartini (1.5 glasses)/bottle format.For the food, we tried a few dishes including the calamari, the sauteed mussels, the rigatoni pasta with spicy grilled shrimp, and the branzino (a special). Unfortunately, the chef must have changed because the food overall was pretty underwhelming. I also think the menu is much smaller than it used to be? I used to be able to order quite a few different apps which was my favorite part but this time there were much more limited choices. I do think the branzino was probably the best dish. The pasta on the other hand should be avoided - it was very bland, undersalted and frankly I could make better at home. Â Overall, while Briciola still has a charming and romantic ambience, I'm pretty disappointed about the limited menu choices and the quality of the dishes. Unfortunately will not be rushing back."

Â This was by far our worst server of 2021!We sat at the inside communal table which is a lot of fun - there are also pretty outside tables should you prefer that!We had our drink order taken pretty quickly but not out food order and sat waiting for a good 15 minutes. At the time of writing this review I was considering dessert but gave up when no one appeared!!The food is the redeeming factor - it's excellent. The Melanzane Caprino ( egg plant Â and goats cheese ) was the standout for me!! One of the best Â dishes I have ever eaten ! Scampi also really good as were the clams . Mussels needed to be warmer ! Pasta was excellent. And beet dishes ( we got two - but we ordered one - olives were missing so assumed that was the error )Beautiful location, great food, but my gosh the service is terrible!"

I don't know what all the microwaves are about and kinda make you second guess but everything I've had here has been super good. Yes it's tiny and cramped, even by pre-covid standards but it is what it is. Overall, recommend especially before or after the theater"

Nothing was tasty, including the olive oil (tasted like plain vegetable oil). We ordered the mixed greens pear salad, shrimp scampi, truffle gnocchi, and wild mushroom truffle fettuccine. The shrimp scampi was the most flavorful out of those dishes (basil, garlic, capers), but again doused in the most boring olive oil. I could not taste the truffles in the mushroom fettuccine, and worse- it was swimming in a flavorless sauce. The truffle gnocchi was not enjoyable at all. It was like a heavy mac n cheese.The wines were just okay, too. The only pleasant thing was the funny friendly waitress. $120 down the drain."
334,8oHCb-XvLpqCQD7En17Fzw,10/18/2021,5 star rating,"Briciola Ratings: 4.7/5Food: 4.75/5 - Randomly decided on this spot one night for dinner, and it's a hidden gem in Hell's Kitchen. The Rigatoni e Gamberi was delicious. Pasta was al dente, shrimp was perfectly grilled and cooked just right. The garlic and tomato sauce was seasoned well, acidic and tasted fresh. I decided to add some chili flakes, and it elevated the dish a lot more. Also, I am usually not a big fan of ravioli, but that lobster ravioli (Tortelloni d' Aragosta) was absolutely incredible, probably some of the best I have tried in Manhattan. The pasta was chewy and firm. The filling was divine, and I can taste the lobster in it. I think the highlight was the cream sauce. It was super creamy, but not heavy, literally perfect with the complimentary bread that they provide. Those are crispy and crunchy. I think they grill the bread in a panini machine before serving it to us. Ambiance: 4.75/5 - Wonderful Italian wine bar for food and drinks on a date night located in Hell's Kitchen. I love the ambiance and vibe, super cute, intimate, and inviting. It is relatively a small restaurant, very old-fashioned dÃ©cor and dimly-lit. Their indoor seating is my favorite part. There's wine bottles on all four walls, and I felt like I was dining at a basement of a wine cellar, so I 100% recommend sitting inside if you can. It is also super clean too, and not too loud. There's also outdoor seating as well. Price: 4.5/5 - The lobster ravioli with pink vodka sauce and the spicy grilled shrimp, with garlic and tomato sauce was both $16 each. The tiramisu was $10. The total came up to be around $50 before tips. The portions are decent sized at reasonable prices. I thought this place is definitely a steal for some high-quality pasta and desserts (top 5 tiramisu in the city).  Service: 4.75/5 - Our server was awesome. He was fun, welcoming, energetic, and super easy to talk to. He was also attentive, fast with his service, and provided some great pasta recommendations to us. The food came out pretty quick and fresh too. I love how all the staffs are all super nice and friendly too. His recommendation of trying out the tiramisu was a major plus; it was phenomenal. BLUF: The tiramisu is a MUST order. It is a hidden gem for some great al dente pasta, good wine, lovely desserts and service. I had a great time overall. So, for the price and ambiance of this place, I would return again whenever I am craving Italian food. Get the Rigatoni e Gamberi pasta and end it with tiramisu, you will be very happy!"

I can't even talk about the Niners. Straight depressing. And to cope w the sitch, the buds were ordering rounds and rounds of shots. Here's why I love this city: pickle backs is a thing. Love pickles. The waitress was coming by effectively and often. The DJ was jamming out the Bay 90s hip hop! Even gave my friend and I a Bay Area shout-out! WOOT! Were we that obvious? Prob bc of our SF and The City stuff happening. Anywho, bar was great. Vibes were cool. But some of the other patrons were TOTAL DBs. It was a lot at some point. One guy had to be told to sit down.

It's a sports bar with a lot of virtues and a couple drawbacks. The virtues? A ton of TVs, and big ones, at that. If you've ever been to some awful place where you end up with neck strain because you have to bend your neck to look at two or three TVs, you're in luck. Second, there is IN-GAME AUDIO, so you can hear Jeff Van Gundy go on a 5-minute digression that has nothing to do with the game and Mark Jackson's meaningless ""hand down, man down"" catchphrase. Hubie Brown or Doris Burke on a better day, I guess.The food is also good. I'm not sure if the chicken tenders were just frozen and popped into the frier, but they seemed a cut above typical bar fare and actually TENDER. So what's wrong with the Grayson? A DJ plays deafening music in between game play. Why?! That's the time we want to talk to friends, analyze the game, and catch up on life. You can't do that with 100 db ""hits"" playing in the background.The logistics are also a disaster. Get ready to wait 20 minutes to pay the bill (""I'm trying to give you guys money!!!"") and so forth. Once again, this is NOT the fault of the staff. It's a STRUCTURAL issue and hampers quality of service, no matter how well-intended the individual staffer. #sociology"

Â But more importantly their seafood is great. Â I've had lobster with noodles and lobster with egg - both are tasty. Â Overall, the decor could use some work, but the restaurant does do a decent job with their food. Â Not as pricey as manhattan Chinese places either so definitely worth a try if you're a person who likes their seafood and Cantonese style cuisine."

I'm sure the same thing didn't only happen to me, it's your problem that they don't respect customers nor run the business in a honest way, not my problem.---Ordered pan fried flounder and mapo tofu ($35 together). The fish was over fried hence very dry, I didn't eat much so I left $40 cash and got ready to go. The waiter stopped me and asked where's my tips? I said it's included and as a cash only restaurant, you shouldn't charge tax. He still wouldn't let me go, so I paid extra tips to be able to get out. Been to every Chinese restaurant in Elmhurst, this is the worst experience, Â plac."

Â Personally, to this day, this is still one of my favorite family style Chinese food. Â So the last time I was here was on my father's birthday on a Sunday night on St. Patrick's Day. Â We were a group of 16 people so we filled up two tables. Â It was very packed but the staff was extremely accommodating. Â The food did not disappoint. Â We had the pan fried noodles with seafood, fried flounder, snow pea leaf with garlic, fried calamari, roast duck, Peking pork chop and house special steak. Â The only pitfall of the restaurant was that they are a cash only spot. Â However, I would definitely return because I know that I can't go wrong with the food."

Food is about the same as I remembered (menu really haven't change much even though the name changed many times... maybe new chef a few times but still the same menu).Ordered family style (of course)- 6 dishes and soup. A real Chinese meal begins with soup (should end with soup but majority of Chinese family don't do a soup again but maybe a hot dessert) and finish with a cold plate of freshly sliced oranges that comes with the check.My family ordered:Soup- Crabs With Fish Maw Soup Special (SEASONAL) deep fried soft shell crabSauteed Sliced Conch with vegetables & Fried Stuffed Bean Curd With Minced Shrimp Pork Chop Peking Style Lobster with ginger & scallionSauteed Flounder Fillet with ginger & scallionFresh Sauteed Clams with minced pork (I think it's ""sang kan"")It is one of the best restaurant in Elmhurst but same Cantonese style food in any Cantonese restaurant."

(I can't remember!)Service is attentive and quick. Menu is also in English. Restrooms could use a remodel.A solid choice in Elmhurst. You will be satisfied."

I tip well even if the service is meh because I have worn the other shoes in customer service jobs. As for dishes people rave about the pork chops, haven't had it but I like the seafood pan fried noodles and walnut honey shrimp so far. My neighbor likes their fried rice dishes."

Peking styled pork is fried pork in sweet and sour sauce and it has a piece of pineapple and tomato. The fish casserole has some fried tofu, cabbage, mushroom, sliced pork, with some fried fish.

I went to the register to order and she wouldn't give eye contact she kept on giggling at another girl behind the counter looked like she finished her shift but was just hanging around . Everytime I would say an order she would look to her friend and be very sarcastic with what she says . I told her to suspend my order so I can speak to a supervisor I spoke to the supervisor she apologized so I placed my order again and the girl nataley said you again . This is the worst don't ever come here there is a Wendy's across the street

Went inside no one acknowledges your there waiting too order and when they do realize your there they mumble your order back to you. This guy mumbled the whole order and I had no clue what he said. Missed an extra order of French fries. They take for ever to make the order then i get the order and i check the bag and I see they missed items and they just don't care. You let them know that they missed items and they say ooh . Like Wtff? Are you gonna give me what I order or no? They took long to even try and gather the rest of the missed items that I left . It wasn't worth it at all!

Most definitely not a fold and eat NY style pizza as I know it. The pie is huge and can probably feed 4-5 people easily. The topping on our pepperoni pie was good and I can see how some people like the simplicity of it, but the dough texture is just not to my liking. I think it really comes down to personal preference. Also seeing other people's photo, I wonder if we got a slightly unusual one. In any case, start with a slice and see if you like it."

423,3Bjnre3_kCgGR8n7cpL8nA,12/20/2014,2 star rating,"One of the things I love about Brooklyn is that you can still find old school pizza joints complete with original owner. Love that. While I wanted to love their pizza, I mean who doesn't love the grandpa behind the counter, their slices just didn't do it for me. It lacked flavor and I found the sauce to be maybe a bit sweet? Wasn't the kind of flavorful pizza I'm used to. One good thing though is that the slices are big. I ordered two and could barely finish the second slice. Was so full.Who ever thinks this spot makes better pizza than 95% of the places in NYC is seriously lacking tastebuds. Trust me, I grew up in NYC and there are way better places out there. I may be new to this neighborhood, but I know my pizza.Sigh, I hope there are better options out here."

If you want a LARGE meal, then you'll be satisfied. If you want healthful, non-grease laden food, then you WON'T be satisfied. My plateful of food was VERY greasy, and okay.

It is tiny and narrow, but they have a counter and several tables for diners. They always have a soup of the day, and I've been very happy with the sandwiches I've gotten both times I've eaten here. If you want a burger, tuna melt, club sandwich or the like, it's a much better option than the overpriced Pete's Cafe, which I have never forgiven for the American cheese-Philly Steak debacle of 2006."

This place was highly recommended to me by multiple people as one of the best brunches in NYC and they were right. This was my favorite brunch in the city TO DATE! Moroccan Brunch means lots of veggie options, turkish coffee and delicious options that don't make you feel all greasy after.Came in on a sunday afternoon before 12pm and was able to get seated immediately for table of 2.Here's what to get: TURKISH COFFEE ***One of the few places offering authentic turkish coffee. They give you the cup to pour yourself because turkish coffee is made with the grounds in the actual coffee, but the cup you pour yourself keeps the grounds back. Deliciously spiced with cardamom notes. I don't even like cardamom that much and I loved this.HALLOUMI SKEWER APPETiZER**Tomato, red onion, red pepper decorate this skewer over two pieces of pita and grilled and seasoned pieces of halloumi cheese. Delicious. Salty, dense halloumi cheese with a gentle crisp and flavorful seasoning meet a gently crispy pita with warm, juicy and flavor-packed tomato (almost better than the halloumi itself) and nicely charred veggies. It's giving fresh. It's giving care. It's giving farm to table.MOROCCAN EGGS W SAUSAGE ***SPEECHLESS!!! SPEECH! LESS! Soft, runny poached eggs decorate a sweet, savory and fresh tomato base flavorfully spiced with warm, seasoned and herb'd up sausage and crispy, warm, fluffy brown pita. So simple. SO DELICIOUS. Y'all i cannot cope. I cannot.MALAWACH ***May not look like much from photos but they give you this really crispy bread that you can eat with the 3 sauces. Hard to describe but DELICIOUS. Everything was really fresh. One was a tomato one, one was like a sour cream sort of thing and the green one (my favorite) has this gentle heat that ends after a really fresh, crunchy vegetable mixture base. The warm, crispy bread - I CANNOT COPE!! Cappuccino here was solid but just ok especially compared to everything else on the menu that was AMAZING!!! Just get the turkish coffee.I went home and kept thinking about this meal and how it f'd me up. My god.Don't come here expecting your traditional American brunch fare or bottomless... it's not that energy. This is what makes NYC great - Moroccan flavors and dishes meeting the American brunch vibe for a unique experience you won't find in many other cities."

This spot is slightly less busy, with some bar seating available on a Saturday afternoon.When sitting down, waiter asks for a drink order before giving a menu, so decided on a simple iced coffee. What came out was an iced oatmeal latte ($7) - good overall but not what I asked/wanted to pay for. For food, went for the Tunisian Sandwich ($16) - sausage, hummus, tomato, peppers, cucumber, and onions. Well seasoned all around and the fresh pita kept it all together. Side of fries were also fresh, served along with some tahini for dipping.Aside from the drink communication, service is solid.

I came on a weekend right around lunch time and thought I'd have at least a 15 minute wait but surprisingly was seated right away even though it was really busy. I got the Moroccan eggs with sausage which were delicious. The eggs were runny, the tomato sauce had a ton of flavor and had a good amount of spice. I usually find places say their dishes are spicy but then taste it and wish there was more spice but this was the perfect level. The pita was warm and soft and also had some seasoning on top. The sausage was a nice addition, but I honestly would've still loved the dish without it. It was good to add for extra protein and a mix of flavors but I felt like the tomato sauce itself was flavorful enough.No complaints about the service either. They came at the right time to take my order, bring out my food, and give me the bill. I never once felt rushed or felt like they were slow."

Tender and not too chewy. Their cold noodles are pretty good too. Generous portions with both dishes, and the noodles weren't soggy. The service was excellent. Portions were large."

Â The soup was spot on, the beef and tendons were tender and tasty and the noodles perfectly Al dente.

The jade cucumbers are a sweet pickled cucumbers, sliced thickly, this as refreshing, definitely try if you like pickles. The noodles are cooked perfectly, not soggy at all. They're generous with the portion of meats in each, each noodle bowl also came with a small amount of bok choy. The beef roll/pancake had braised beef and cucumbers in it with some hoisin sauce. The sauce was on the saltier side. They also offer some rice dishes and bubble teas.Service was pretty quick and servers were nice.

Â The beef noodle soup was also really good - noodles were cooked Al dente and had a nice bounce when you bit into them. Â The broth was also super flavorful - I kept on drinking spoonfuls of it. Â The Dan Dan noodles were super hot (both in temperature and spice). Â It was tad bit spicy for me to actually enjoy - it was very numbing.

They also threw in some popcorn chicken but I don't think we would've missed that if they hadn't. Appreciate the gesture though. Overall go for the noodles and soups and warm up on a cold day!"

To start, the beef noodle soup set the bar high-- noodles were chewy, broth was deep and spicy, and the meat was flavorful and tender. Same with the taiwanese braised pork rice which was brimming with pork belly!! I'm salivating thinking of it. With some tea eggs, this makes an ideal meal.Unfortunately the beef pancake missed the mark. The soybean sauce they used was so damn salty, i couldnt taste any of the braised beef. Also, instead of a light and flaky scallion pancake, it was oily and paper thin which was just crunchy and unsatisfying. I did enjoy that they offer braised tofu which was tasty but definitely on the more bland side. All in all i love that theres a new taiwanese spot so close to the astor stop! Definitely have to order the right things and most items are quite affordable. Excited to come back and try more things."

And with all my walking I still happened to miss the Brooklyn Inn. It was always frustrating to find a low key neighborhood bar. Recently I was invited to come here by a Â friend, who explained that it's one of Brooklyn's oldest bars, if not the oldest. You had me at oldest bar. At the end of the day, I love a bar that is not full of amateurs. My friend's buddy Terri was bartending. She was an absolute sweet heart. Â When I walked in I instantly love the look of the bar. And the entrance was also beautiful, detailed and literally the corner. The bar is nice and dark and candle lit. I came back here on a Monday and it was just perfection. There was all kinds of old school tunes like Mac the Knife playing overhead. And there was only regulars, the bartender Tom was familiar with most of the people sitting at the bar. I was able to squeeze on to the bar stool and order a IPA and a water. I enjoyed soaking up the detailing of the bar and the unique carvings. The high ceilings and stained glass were stunning. You just don't see bars like this anymore. Â As I sat there, Kevin another bartender Â that works at the Brooklyn Inn was enjoying a beverage next to me. Kevin was super chatty. He explained the history of the bar and pointed out a gargoyle and some of the pieces that are still original to the bar. He was a great conversationalist. He said the best time to come was in the winter, the fresh, flaky white snow is falling and it's reminiscent of a giant snow globe. I will undoubtedly be back and I have to bring my older brother here. He loves playing pool and old bars."

Walked into this bar and these locals sitting on the end apparently gave us dirty looks and started saying something about us to each other - I say apparently because my friends were the ones who noticed. Had I noticed, I might have gotten the early hint that we were probably not welcome. But oh, don't you worry, the bartender made it pretty clear. We approached the bar and she was an older, stout blonde who was the rudest bartender I've ever met. We didn't even get a hello, just a terse ""okay, first I need to see some ID."" We pulled them out, and after thorough inspection she says, ""ok, what do you want?"" Â I was actually shocked at how rude she was to us. As she took our drink orders she just radiated a complete lack of desire to serve us. We sat down for one drink in a little alcove next to the bar and the first thing we all said was ""wow, that bartender is a b****!"" Completely killed the vibe of what could have been a cool place. When we finished our beers one of us suggested we get another round, and the rest of us said absolutely not, we are not giving that woman any more business. Never coming back here again. Pretty sure that's what the intent was, as I've read other reviews and it seems to be a bar catered to townies only. Luckily there are lots of great bars nearby (we checked out 61 Local right after and it definitely brightened our moods after our horrible experience at Brooklyn Inn) so if you are new in the area, definitely avoid this place at all costs."

There's no loud music to annoy you (wow, I hate music?!, I must be getting really old).The bartenders are genuinely friendly. I love to order my double Jameson on the rocks here.There's a Billiard table at the back, and 2 unnoticeable bathroom doors.I could not find fault to this place not that I am looking for any.A must when you are in Cobble Hill neighborhood."

Â However, as a jerk face myself... last night the gentlemen who was the barkeep made my point .. a polite welcoming atmosphere is only created by those who pour the drinks. Â During these fudged up times where cultural sensitivities are heightened this bar hit the mark with me. Â Like I said I am pretty sure that this joint may normally be smug but man kudos to the barkeep. Â The bar is beautiful and the pool table is fun. Â Other than that. Â I would say it's a rich mans version of a dive bar. Â My only complaint... the place closed at 4am. Â I took off a star because of the smugness and they don't take cards at all and probably don't pay taxes like the rich people they serve. Lol."

I always say I'll give it one more chance, but last night was my final straw. It's a tale as old as time: people with gigantic chips on their shoulders make for very poor bartenders."

I couldn't ask for a better place to celebrate a long week or unwind after a long day. Also, these guys helped me throw the best surprise birthday party for my wife.

Anyway, I got to check this place out on a Sunday night, and it was perfectly low-key and had a diverse crowd drinking at the bar. The space itself is narrow, with lots of seating at the bar, and a decent sized backyard that I did not explore considering it's freezing out. The bartender was friendly and we got our drinks shortly after sitting down. I think they also serve some bar type food, but nothing too fancy. I could see this place getting packed on a Friday or Saturday night, so off nights are better if you are looking to drink alone or complain more!

Just like all city changes, some are good changes and some are bad. Few times have I walked into a bar and felt this welcomed. Even just a ""hey, how are ya"" from the bartender is all the warmth it takes. But coming in here, it's not just me, this is everyone's neighborhood bar, and the bartenders are welcoming to everyone who comes in. Just like all dives, you get some troublemakers once in awhile. The bartenders handle the trouble with class, and talk to everyone on a human level, without saying something like ""get the f out"", like what happens in far too many dives in Brooklyn. They talk to everyone with respect. The cute tatted bartender on Saturdays taught me about the ""turtle juice"" shot they do, and now I can't do a shot of anything else! It's too good. And the bartender Linda? She's a great dancer behind the bar, and the kindest of souls.Anyway, come for the good vibes, stay for the good vibes, and leave feeling like it's a second home."

I'm also still trying to figure out their spice blend for the avocado toast. So light, so flavorful, without ever losing the avo flavor. Owners are the sweetest people in the area.

Got my fix of Mac and cheese and candied yams.After a 20 minute wait and another 15 minutes to get back to work my food was still perfectly hot. Flakey fried catfish with a perfectly season breading. Nothing bland here. Mac was good and the candied yams were perfect. Although the prices were kinda high with a long wait time here the serving size was massive and left me with a food coma after eating it all.Eat here!

I wish I remembered our waitresses name, because she made our dining experience very please.The food was incredible, I ordered the eggplant parm, which I would argue was better than most chicken Parmesans I have had in the past. The red sauce was perfectly seasoned and not too sweet. Our waitress helped me select the perfect wine paring to go with my meal.My date ordered the pork chop and it had one of the best fresh of the grill tastes I've had outside of a backyard barbecue.I'd define it return here with a group or for happy hour any time!"
507,pTv4RDll3N_CGG3BwtEctg,2/13/2022,4 star rating,My good friends and I decided to stop by here for restaurant week. We made a reservation in advance - which was around 6 pm on a Tuesday. It was fairly quiet when we first came in but it eventually gets pretty busy and packed as the night went on. The place itself has a pretty romantic vibe with dim lighting and extremely nice decor. For appetizers - majority of us went with the Polpette meatballs which was super tasty - it was three meatballs and they were mixed with meat and cheese with extra cheese on top. One of us went with the Caesar salad - which was a surprisingly hefty salad (it was made majority with kale rather than your typical lettuce for caesar salad) but it was pretty tasty as well. For the main dish we all decided to get the Pappardelle pasta which was pretty tasty but we found that it seemed a bit inconsistent in the plating; one of our friends dish had almost no sauce and some of us had a significant amount of sauce but other than that the flavors in the sauce and the short rib was amazing. The pasta itself was pretty good as well but we wished it soaked up more flavor from the sauce but otherwise it was a good portion size and we were very full after it. For dessert - majority of us went with the Tiramisu which was amazing; the flavors went so well together and it was not super strong of alcohol taste. Â Overall - nice romantic vibes and would definitely recommend coming here for a date night spot.

The chicken was a little less seasoned than what I prefer. The other dishes were pretty good. The servers were very attentive. We also got a couple glasses of wine which were great too.

We were seated as soon as we arrived and started looking over the menu. They have a nice mix of wine, beer, and cocktails. I went with a montepulciano, but my friends ordered a few of the cocktails and enjoyed them. We shared a few appetizers, namely the Fritto Misto, Artichokes alla Romana, Focaccia di Recco, and Eggplant & Zucchini. For an entrÃ©e, I went with the Forest Mushroom pizza. Overall, the food was good. The flatbread was just ok for me, but otherwise I really enjoyed all the other items. I also could've used a few less scallions on my pizza, but I enjoyed the flavors aside from that. Portion sizes were also ample. Service was good. Our waitress was attentive and gave us some good recommendations for appetizers. She and other also came over to check-in, but never made us feel rushed. Ambiance is really great as well. I loved the way the space was decorated. It's not a large room, but it still felt very open and inviting. Overall, I highly recommend Gran Morsi. Though it's location may not be the most convenient for everyone, the food and experience made for a really fun evening!"

The bread pudding was initially brought in to our table but soon after the server told us that there were more items that would accompany the dessert.

This made the presentation exciting but unfortunately, the alcohol was excessive and we could no longer eat the dessert since it was overly bitter."

I don't know what I was expecting, not that it would live up to the quality of Sweetgreen, but at least was hoping that it would reach the level of quality Chop't brings. I was mistaken. Salads are overpriced considering you're eating lazily washed and barely cut pieces of lettuce with tasteless rubbery looking chicken. I've tasted a total of 3 salads here, all of which tasted boringly predictable and yet still bad. The buffalo chicken salad looks very different from its menu photo where the chicken is nicely smeared in buffalo sauce. My buffalo chicken tasted like grilled chicken and with only pepper jack cheese, celery, and tortilla chips, had not much going for it. The celery, which should never be the staple in salads since it just tastes bland, was cut in different styles all throughout. I almost wondered if my salad was prepared in between shift changes that accounted for such a huge discrepancy in celery piece sizes. The thai chicken crunch salad again has celery (!), red cabbage, grilled chicken, carrots, and thankfully the redeemer: wontons. The flavor of the salad is overpowered by the spicy Thai peanut sauce, which was a poor attempt at replicating the bold delicious Thai flavors.They were serving small bowls of chicken Caesar salad to taste when we arrived so I got to try one. Their chicken Caesar salad is pretty standard affair, so if you're a fan of chicken Caesar this salad won't be disappointing, but also not outstanding either. As their name suggests, it was just salad, nothing more. You shouldn't come here if you are looking to find a spot where you learn to love salads. For that, you can go to Sweetgreen at less than a mile's distance."

575,HzmjJ1mM0WdOHbfYm5mxqw,5/24/2016,4 star rating,"I work at the Bronx VA a lot, and Perista is right nearby. They have a pretty large menu which might make you suspicious about the quality of individual items, but the food is always solid. Their prices are very cheap, and they deliver promptly. I've ordered a lot of basics off the menu - stuff like sandwiches, burgers, chicken fingers, and salads (maybe I'm spending too much time as work #womp). The Greek salad is nice. I also tried the homemade chicken noodle soup yesterday, and it's like something out of grandma's kitchen. Really delicious. I've visited the actual restaurant a time or two and it's a little bit old looking but cute and very diner-y. The waitstaff there are personable and laid back.Summary: While this place certainly is not fine dining, I give them four stars for always having solid food, reliable delivery, and great prices."
576,HzmjJ1mM0WdOHbfYm5mxqw,10/21/2014,5 star rating,I feel in love ! Real true love with their delish eggplant parm!My heart broke when they changed their delivery zone and now i can't indulge. Do order from here! You wont be disappointed.
577,HzmjJ1mM0WdOHbfYm5mxqw,8/2/2014,5 star rating,This place is great. Breakfast is the best. Pancakes and their special bread french toast are so good. I order here all the time. I also like going and eating there. The owners are wonderful and just so nice. They make you feel like family. If you grave anything they are good at making it up for you. They do the food how you ask which for me is appreciated. Come here or order from you will love it if you love diner food.

On 2 separate occasions i found both hair on my hash and what seemed to be a piece of plastic or something unnatural stuck to my bacon. These guys might of been around for a while in the Bronx, but if a Starbucks replaces them tomorrow , the kingsbridge community would not notice. They are just too behind the times and honestly I can easily compare them to a watered down waffle house from the south (and waffle houses are bad as it is). And no they dont have the best coffee in the bronx like their menus say, Garden gourmet market does."
580,HzmjJ1mM0WdOHbfYm5mxqw,11/20/2015,1 star rating,"OK, so I ordered two eggs and cheese on a rye bread. Delivery. They brought me fried runny eggs with potato. And charged me more. When I asked to replace it, owner told me that he has no delivery man, and asked to call next day and he ""will make it right"".Guess what. I called and ordered a grilled chicken sandwich by delivery, and asked to speak to the owner. It is a joke. He took a dollar and fifty cents from the bill. When I asked him why so little, he started complaining that he has to make a living, pay bills etc.Needless to say they lost my business there."
581,HzmjJ1mM0WdOHbfYm5mxqw,8/23/2015,1 star rating,"As soon as I opened the box, I knew I was in for a terrible trip. I had a what the **** is this?! Moment upon seeing the ""coleslaw"" in a coffee filter peeking out from under my soggy burger and fries. Soggy is actually and understatement as the bottom bun was soaked and falling apart which is extremely unappetizing (just gross) to say the the least. The patty was questionable and flavorless, the american cheese was on the coffee filter and doing nothing for the burger, and the lettuce, thick pickle slice and slice of tomato were throw in the box as an after thought. I understand it's a diner burger but its below average even for what it is. The milkshake arrive warm and was extremely sweet. Unfortunately I have nothing positive to say about this restaurant. It was FAR below average in quality and certainly a lot more expensive than it should have been especially considering the garbage I received. I suspect they should have stuck to selling breakfast items and not offer delivery because it's truly not worth it."
582,HzmjJ1mM0WdOHbfYm5mxqw,12/5/2016,1 star rating,"I waited an hour and a half for my food that never came. When I called to inquire about whether or not Â it was on its way, they told me ""I'm pretty sure it's already been delivered since the delivery guy is right here.""Then proceeded to tell me repeatedly that they delivered it so it is out of their hands. Clearly it had not been delivered or I wouldn't have been calling in the first place. I suggested that maybe he delivered it to the wrong address, the woman just kept trying to argue with me saying no we delivered it to your address and a man accepted. No men live here. They didn't even offer some sort of ""we can remake it for you and have it redelivered"" I wouldn't have accepted at that point but they just left it as ""well we delivered it and it was the right address so I don't know what to tell you"" What terrible customer service!I don't write reviews, but I hate being called a liar. And I, quite frankly, am hangry now. Do yourself a favor, don't order delivery from this place."

They charged me full price for curry chicken which by the way was a few pieces of bone that was left in the tray. The service sucked, one person was taking out my food and there was a line behind me and the rest of the four workers sat down and ate. That's not a good business move,I wouldn't have my customers wait while I ate. I bought some lamb curry, that sucked as well as the bryani! Never again will I go there and by the way if you're not they're own kind of people (Indian) they're not too nice. Â  Â Anyway don't waste your time with this place...If you're going to be open 24 hours have food for 24 hours. DUH!"

The queue there was more thickly populated than many countries in the world.Alternatively, I thought about trying this place instead as I was in the neighborhood for Â a meeting. I ordered a small pineapple and banana smoothie. It was def. small. It was the size of small coffee that the carts sell for $1. Ok i.e. an unfair comparison but I was very disappointed to pay $4 for only two gulps of a smoothie??

608,BYOxFf1eg66kWDK8KOvNeQ,1/5/2023,4 star rating,I've been hearing such good things about @thaidiner so I was super excited to try out this Thai fusion place. I liked the babka french toast a lot. What a great idea! It was not too sweet and definitely could taste the Thai tea (even though I did have to put on a lot more butter than usual). Would be better if the toast could be less soggy. The noodles were good but didn't leave too much of an impression on me.

Everything was pre-ordered and I paid for nothing.Everything that was ordered was DELICIOUS! I had been wanting to try this place so it worked out that our party was here. We had, to name a few, the papaya salad, disco fries, pad Thai, crab fried rice, the curry with chicken dish. Quite a few of the dishes had a bit of a kick to them so if you don't like spicy food you might be limited here. For dessert we got a gigantic coconut sundae, which I really wanted to try, and a coffee monster cake. Enjoyed every bite! The service was great. They were attentive in clearing plates and checking if anyone wanted another drink."
610,BYOxFf1eg66kWDK8KOvNeQ,12/24/2022,3 star rating,"Thai Diner gets a lot of foot traffic. And for good reason. It is a stylish Thai restaurant with dishes that are not traditionally on a Thai restaurant's menu. To me this is almost a modernized Thai restaurant or Thai fusion restaurant. If you want to try something with Thai influences and sit in a cool subway car on the sidewalk, this is your place. If you want traditional Thai food at a reasonable price, it's not.Phat See Ew: 6/10First of all what is with the ""ph""? I don't know but would love to be educated! I've always seen is a pad see ew. Anyways, I like Pad See Ew at other restaurants but this one was way too oily and sweet. I didn't like the flavor that much and with all the oil - maybe cause I hit it with the short rib - was almost too much for me to stomach. Definitely not worth the $20+ price.Phat Thai: 7/10Again with the ""ph"". The Phat Thai here is similar to a Pad Thai, it's just more expensive and smaller. It's nothing special and if you come here over another Thai restaurant, you're better off getting another one of their dishes instead.Lobster Curry: 7.5/10The lobster curry was really good! Definitely a unique dish. I docked it an extra .5 because even though I was warned that it was ""a little spicy"" one drop to the tough was intense. I was unprepared for the amount of heat. The taste was good when I wasn't sniffling and trying to catch my breath in between sips of water and bites of rice.Disco Fries: 8/10These fries are good! I mean, when was the last time you saw curry on top of French fries? The uniqueness of this dish is what makes it special. Definitely worth a share for the table."

My friend also got the martini which he said was quite strong (and our server warned him lol) but still really good. Overall, it was one of the best dining experiences in the city I've had in the last 8 years. Â Just be prepared to wait for a table, there's a lot of bars close by so you can easily grab a drink somewhere while you wait."

613,BYOxFf1eg66kWDK8KOvNeQ,3/9/2023,5 star rating,"I came to Thai Diner for brunch on a Wednesday at noon. I had a reservation for three which I made around a week in advance (although I read you can come without one on weekdays I just did not feel like risking it.) We got there right on time and were seated in this very nice booth in a corner. I was not super sure what to expect regarding the ambiance but I really liked it! It felt very casual, and had a very palpable ""diner"" feel with all the booths/ the decorations while keeping a strong Thai restaurant vibe at the same time-- I thought that was truly special and unique. Our really nice server came by with menus. They have a pretty straightforward selection with items for both breakfast (that are served until 5pm) and then dinner. For drinks, my boyfriend ordered an americano (since their bottomless coffee is only on weekends) and his brother got a thai ice coffee which they both really liked. In terms of food we had: Thai Disco Fries: I am not typically a fries person but these were actually amazing! They come with some massaman curry at the bottom, delicious grilled onions, and peanuts. The combination of the potatoes soaked in the creamy, rich, coconuty curry is amazing. The grilled onions also give it an extra dimension of flavor that is very good and everything goes well together mixed with the crunchy peanuts and scallions on top. They had a nice spicy kick from the curry! Keep this in mind if you have a low tolerance for spice (you can probably quench the heat with a refreshing thai tea though!) Truly, if fries always tasted like this, I would definitely eat them every day of my life. Thai Diner Egg Sandwich: amazing as well. The roti was buttery, and flaky. The egg was perfectly cooked and covered with a layer of that yellow American cheese that makes anything seem like a guilty pleasure. It came with really well flavored sausage as well and this really nice creamy white sauce that had basil in it. There is a citrus red sauce that comes with it which really ties it all together very well and highlights all the flavors. I was a fan of this sauce and thought the sandwich was definitely better with it than without but it is worth trying it both ways to see what you prefer! Phat See Ew: got this with chicken. The flavor was very good for this dish, it had a nice sauce that was not too rich but had the perfect level of umami/sweet. I was not too much of a fan of the noodles themselves since they were a little overdone and did not feel as chewy as I am used to. However, the chicken was actually fantastic. I feel like usually when you add a protein to a dish it tends to just be okay (chicken can be dry, bland, etc) but this was so flavorful, tender and juicy while maintaining a crispy skin. Wish I had just ordered extra chicken on the side because it was that good. Â Thai Tea Babka French Toast: delicious, as you might expect. The babka is soft, a little sweet, and grilled to perfection. You get a side of Thai Tea flavored butter that actually has a very strong thai tea flavor without being too sweet. Then you also get this really nice extra topping of salted condensed milk that was delicious because, again, it was not as sweet as you might imagine and had the delicious signature flavor of condensed milk. This was definitely one of my favorite dishes of the day! My only comment is that for me temperature gradients can be important under some contexts and I did not get that as much here-- the condensed milk was warm/hot and I feel like this dish would have been even better with cold condensed milk to have a more striking contrast with the warm french toast. Besides from this, it was perfect and I will most definitely get this again in the future.  Overall, I truly loved this place! I want to come back already. The ambiance is super cute and unique, the service was excellent, and the food was incredible. If you want to get a good brunch that is a deviation from traditional American brunch spots, definitely come here. You will not regret it."

Upon walking in, I was already impressed as the interior looked very cute and definitely had Thai vibes which I thought was very nice :)We ordered the Thai disco fries, khao soi, and the beef short rib basil dish (forgot the actual menu name). Everything was very unique and super flavorful in its own way. But I have to say the disco fries were definitely my favorite! I'm a super big fries fan and have lots of different types of fries before - and let me tell you, I've never had fries like this before. It's kinda like a less heavy more flavorful poutine, and the texture of the fries were just perfect. 10/10 would recommend!Overall I really enjoyed this place and would come back again!

The dishes are big so we shared the crab fried rice and short rib massaman curry between three people for lunch. Both dishes were great, but you would be making a mistake if you left without ordering the massaman curry.We didn't have a reservation, but were quickly accommodated with an outdoor table. Some of the outdoor dining is in an enclosed structure but they do have a few tables on the street, one of which we were able to nab. The indoor dining room has a very ornate Thai palace meets New York diner vibe, but ya know Â COVID. The service was very attentive and friendly, would definitely come back to try more stuff.Wheelchair access details: step-free access from the street, fully accessible restroom."

Imagine my glee when I saw that it was located directly across the street from my hotel in NYC...I can't even begin to tell you.While the sandwiches have definitely been americanized, with a lot of my old favourites not being available, it was still so good that I sought out a cooler box and brought several sandwiches back to Los angeles with me (no, really, I did!).The chicken and bacon sandwich is my favourite by far, along with the roast beef sandwich. I tried the hot falafel sandwich, too, which was great, but very salty. Carrot cake here is also just as I remember it, although a bit sweeter.All sandwiches are made fresh, and it is a great way to get some food without wondering which part of the animal it is, like many of pret's fast food competitors."

Â Their coffee is ok.The sandwiches are premade, which is good and bad. Â The good part is that, yes, they are well made. Â The bad part is that, unlike local delis, you cannot ask them to hold an ingredient that you don't like, or to add extras.And Pret can be pricey.While the seating isn't bad, it can get crowded during lunch hours. Â On the plus side, you can walk over to Bryant Park if the weather is nice.Basically, this is a decent place to get lunch or a snack."

So 1 star it is.If you're in the city, then you are bound to run into a pret. They are everywhere, which makes it convenient when you want to grab a quick bite to eat. I really enjoy their warm wraps and I especially like that they make their food fresh every day. Organic coffee too!I've been to other pret locations and the employees are always so welcoming and nice and courteous. I know they are probably tired of being SO nice, but they do a good job hiding their tiredness! Which I really appreciate. I came to this Broadway and 39th location once, and that will be my last time as well. I came in wanting some tomato soup. Since I never tried their soups before, I wasn't familiar with their selection. Their tomato soup is called 'tomato and feta.' Maybe it didn't occur to me during that time that tomato and feta = tomato soup! So I asked an employee at the register ""Do you have anymore tomato soup?"" She was shocked that they were out and proceeded to ask another employee if they have anymore tomato soup. Then this employee goes over to their soups, points at tomato and feta, and says to me ""No miss, you're just blind."" I was utterly shocked and froze for a little bit, trying to process what he said to me and did he REALLY just say that to a paying customer? AND THEN he laughs in my face, with his other coworkers joining in soon after. Yes, I was being laughed at and humiliated in front of other paying customers because i had a question.I am NEVER coming to this pret again."

This is a regular lunch spot for me.Fairly clean for a lunch place (especially given how busy they are), the staff stay busy and (amazingly) stay very friendly every time I've been there.Their food is organic, made fresh (it's pre-made, but nothing's from the previous day and the quality doesn't suffer), and the menu changes occasionally. They have separate bins for trash, recycling, and compost.It's quick (the name is French for ""ready to eat"") and they have plenty of checkout lines during the lunch rush. It's not as cheap as Subway, but worlds better in every other respect, and still not bad for lunch. If you come in the middle of lunch, though, you do have to wait for a table/seat to open up.They say they have wifi, and even print the password on the receipt, but I've never gotten it to work, and when I ask, they say they don't have it."

They ignore you - will run around and laugh and joke around with all the other co-workers. While this is happening, the lines are never in order because the cashiers are never paying attention to handling the lines. This causes people to cut and makes it unfair to people who have been waiting. Some of the cashiers are very polite, but others have been rude on many occasions. It's just chaos. The food is good of course. That's not the issue. Also - the light roast coffee is ALWAYS empty - and this is around 9/9:30 AM."

I would first like to start with the smile I receive from every single staff when I walk into Pret A Manger first thing in the morning, they all great me with warm and cheerful smiles with a joyous ""good morning"" which wakes me up better then your light roast coffee! Besides for the welcoming feeling I get when I walk in, they would instantly recognize I am a usual and have my drink ready before I even get to the cashier which makes me and my brother extremely happy! If any of the staff would realize that I am not feeling well or in a bad mood they would instantly make me smile but asking me whats wrong and asking if I need any help, which I love!I would specifically like to talk about these two specific employees that work at this Pret which is Darell and Sasha. Those two employees are the best employees I have ever met in my life! They are the main reason I come to this Pret every morning with my older brother! They would make me laugh every second I see them from joking around about my coffee and by having my coffee ready without even noticing. On top of that Darell would make the coffee perfect every single time! Me and my brother like complicated drinks for instance we get a double shot espresso over ice with a hint of hazelnut and just the foam of skim milk. If any starbucks barista heard this they would instantly get confused. But Darell would get the drink right every single time which I love!! To show the love they give me and my brother, one day I walked in sick and Sasha right away realized I was sick. Instead of making me a coffee she insisted I would drink a peppermint tea with lemon and honey. She made this tea for me and I am convinced that this tea made me feel much better throughout the day.This specific Pret is the best Pret I have EVER visited in my whole life!! Besides for it being the BEST Pret, it is the best coffee shop I have ever been to in my life. From the joyous and friendly employees to the magnificent food and coffee! I recommend this Pret and every Pret to all of my friends, family and co workers! I would love to give a BIG thank you to the whole staff at the 39th and Broadway Pret, and I can not forget about Sasha and Darell the BEST Employees I have ever met!!-Mordi Lati"

Imagine my glee when I saw that it was located directly across the street from my hotel in NYC...I can't even begin to tell you.While the sandwiches have definitely been americanized, with a lot of my old favourites not being available, it was still so good that I sought out a cooler box and brought several sandwiches back to Los angeles with me (no, really, I did!).The chicken and bacon sandwich is my favourite by far, along with the roast beef sandwich. I tried the hot falafel sandwich, too, which was great, but very salty. Carrot cake here is also just as I remember it, although a bit sweeter.All sandwiches are made fresh, and it is a great way to get some food without wondering which part of the animal it is, like many of pret's fast food competitors."
657,AvpB-RQgEW9N4Eip3l3cww,2/4/2015,3 star rating,"I generally like Pret. Â The sandwiches are good, as are some of the other foods (soups, cookies, brownies, chips, etc.). Â Their coffee is ok.The sandwiches are premade, which is good and bad. Â The good part is that, yes, they are well made. Â The bad part is that, unlike local delis, you cannot ask them to hold an ingredient that you don't like, or to add extras.And Pret can be pricey.While the seating isn't bad, it can get crowded during lunch hours. Â On the plus side, you can walk over to Bryant Park if the weather is nice.Basically, this is a decent place to get lunch or a snack."

Those two employees are the best employees I have ever met in my life! They are the main reason I come to this Pret every morning with my older brother! They would make me laugh every second I see them from joking around about my coffee and by having my coffee ready without even noticing. On top of that Darell would make the coffee perfect every single time! Me and my brother like complicated drinks for instance we get a double shot espresso over ice with a hint of hazelnut and just the foam of skim milk. If any starbucks barista heard this they would instantly get confused. But Darell would get the drink right every single time which I love!!

Will not come back.

Imagine my glee when I saw that it was located directly across the street from my hotel in NYC...I can't even begin to tell you.While the sandwiches have definitely been americanized, with a lot of my old favourites not being available, it was still so good that I sought out a cooler box and brought several sandwiches back to Los angeles with me (no, really, I did!).The chicken and bacon sandwich is my favourite by far, along with the roast beef sandwich. I tried the hot falafel sandwich, too, which was great, but very salty. Carrot cake here is also just as I remember it, although a bit sweeter.All sandwiches are made fresh, and it is a great way to get some food without wondering which part of the animal it is, like many of pret's fast food competitors."
687,AvpB-RQgEW9N4Eip3l3cww,2/4/2015,3 star rating,"I generally like Pret. Â The sandwiches are good, as are some of the other foods (soups, cookies, brownies, chips, etc.). Â Their coffee is ok.The sandwiches are premade, which is good and bad. Â The good part is that, yes, they are well made. Â The bad part is that, unlike local delis, you cannot ask them to hold an ingredient that you don't like, or to add extras.And Pret can be pricey.While the seating isn't bad, it can get crowded during lunch hours. Â On the plus side, you can walk over to Bryant Park if the weather is nice.Basically, this is a decent place to get lunch or a snack."

I really enjoy their warm wraps and I especially like that they make their food fresh every day. Organic coffee too!I've been to other pret locations and the employees are always so welcoming and nice and courteous. I know they are probably tired of being SO nice, but they do a good job hiding their tiredness! Which I really appreciate. I came to this Broadway and 39th location once, and that will be my last time as well. I came in wanting some tomato soup. Since I never tried their soups before, I wasn't familiar with their selection. Their tomato soup is called 'tomato and feta.' Maybe it didn't occur to me during that time that tomato and feta = tomato soup! So I asked an employee at the register ""Do you have anymore tomato soup?"" She was shocked that they were out and proceeded to ask another employee if they have anymore tomato soup. Then this employee goes over to their soups, points at tomato and feta, and says to me ""No miss, you're just blind."" I was utterly shocked and froze for a little bit, trying to process what he said to me and did he REALLY just say that to a paying customer? AND THEN he laughs in my face, with his other coworkers joining in soon after.

When I checked out and asked for the bread that comes with the soup, the employee at the counter said they were out. This was surprising since the restaurant would still be open for another five hours before the six pm Sunday closing time. When I asked if there were any other bread options he said no without any apology. I felt slightly cheated since the small cup of soup sans bread was almost $6. Once I opened up my cup and ate it, I was truly disappointed. Although the taste was nice, there was hardly anything in my serving aside from broth. I left the restaurant feeling ripped off and still hungry."

707,65VJnrsaHS6NZejxnnu23A,4/30/2013,3 star rating,Over the years working in the area I pretty much go to Pret every morning for a cup of organic coffee. Â I mean literally every morning. Â So if the light roast is off I know about it. Â Our office moved 2 blocks over and I've been going to this Pret since it is the closest. Â The organic coffee has been reliably good and the ladies and gents have been friendly every morning. Â The sandwiches have been fine and crossaints very good. Â I feel the baguettes could have more stuff inside. Â Yesterday morning I stuck to bagel and cream cheese exactly because of that reason. Â It just doesn't justify paying more and I don't even eat bagels. Â One rare afternoon I came in for cup of coffee and temperature was not hot enough. Â Don't like warm coffee it needs to be hot. Â That was enough for me to head to Starbucks if I need an afternoon jolt.

It is perfect for a nice quiet family dinner because in any other chinese restaurant we would be screaming on top of each other just to hear what we need to say. I usually bring my family here also because the service is superior here and the food is scrumptious. They change your dirty plates and refill your tea promptly. They are quick with your requests. The prices are right, it isn't overpriced. The lobster and shrimp here is delicious!"
709,AvpB-RQgEW9N4Eip3l3cww,8/27/2013,4 star rating,"came for a family dinner. their largest table can probably seat 12-13 comfortably. we had 14 and it was tight. but when i called to make the reservation they were up front about that and suggested splitting to 2 tables. we ordered probably 14-15 dishes plus the soup. not too sure how the veggie dishes were but for the most part, everything was spot on and yummy.-cilantro pork fish tofu soup- was a bit on the watery side but decent enough to satisfy the craving. park asia still does it the best!-peking porkchops- nicely seasoned/flavored, not too vinegary-garlic roast chicken- either they hid the white meat or the whole chicken was comprised of 2 dark meat sides.. tasty and crispy altho we wondered where's the white meat??-shrimp w.mayo and walnuts- nicely fried, a litttle eensy bit mushy but still was crispy-clams and black bean sauce- altho the clams were probably not the freshest from the market, it was seasoned well and cooked well. these weren't the cheap mini clams either-bitter melon w/beef- nicely cooked as well-eggplant w. salty fish and chicken- yum. not the best i've had but still tasty and satisfying-steamed carp- not memorable and definitely not as fresh as it could have been, but not bad-roasted quail- was very yummy and done spot on!my family raved how affordable and tasty everything came out to be. the only fail that happened was the waiter spilled one of a dishes' liquids/sauces on my uncle on the way back to the kitchen. another thing was i brought a cake for after dinner and they failed to put it in the fridge. my cake wasn't ice cream but still needed to be refrigerated!!! either way, we usually spend in the range of 300-400 with tips for this group but spent just under 300 at this restuarnat. like the other reviews, this is a local neighborhood place with just 10 tables so either come early or call ahead because it was full when we came! i think we will definitely be back for family dinners."

We went here for dinner and they managed to sit all of us which was a surprise considering the fact that my family is huge. We ordered a lobster noodle dish which was very popular with the everyone including my grandmother who finds everything she usually eats to be too salty. Another dish that was good is the shrimp with honey walnuts. I could eat that dish straight up all day with a bowl of rice. The roasted chicken was one of my sisters favorites. She practically ate the whole chicken herself and that's saying a lot. She's usually extremely picky with food.overall if you're looking for a fancy restaurant this is not the place for you, but if you want to have a nice family dinner with decent prices i would highly recommend this place."

We came in about a half hour before closing and the man behind by the counter was so nice and willing to help in any way he could. He even opened up already sealed containers to add some chickpea salad to my bowl. We ordered (2) create your own bowls with extra tzatsiki and a side of pita chips with dip to total $30. Not too shabby when the bowls were filled to the brim and felt like bricks. There is a large sitting area, fill your own soda section and some grab n' go options. I will definitely be ordering again or stopping in to grab another bowl when the craving hits."

(Typical Greeks) and yes I can say that cause I am one and it's true. And no soda which was paid for. Highly dissatisfied highly disappointedI really wanted to support this place, but the last few times I ordered from there it was a disaster. Maybe you'll have luck going there"

Â I can happily support a business who's owners take ownership of any issue Â I order from here every so often, usually the food is great and the delivery is quick. Â Tonight I ordered a lamb salad bowl. Â They delivered steak. Â Cool, mistakes happen, so I called. Â I was told that it was lamb even though it looks and tastes like steak. Â I was essentially called a liar on the phone and nothing was resolved. Â Came to yelp to see if there are photos and if I was just wrong. Â I am not, unless every person that has posted a review with steak was wrong and really meant to type lamb. Â Honestly, food isnt bad, but I thats not how you treat someone after you just botched a $20 salad. Â  Take your business elsewhere"

I've had actual lemon potatoes in Greece, so I may be spoiled by having had the real deal. Nonetheless, everything else is totally worth it. They also have a point card which is always a double win."

Literally all my cravings were satisfied and I nearly shed a tear from how happy I was. I ordered on Seamless and got Chicken Rice with Brown Rice, EONS Salad, Chickpea Salad, Garlic Spread, and added Gigante Beans and Lemon Potatoes. And hummus and pita. I was hungry.The food came relatively quickly, was still warm, Â and portions were much larger than I expected. I was so happy. Generous portion of chicken and well seasoned. Loved the EONS salad and the Gigante Beans are a MUST. Wasn't a huge fan of the Chickpea Salad or Lemon potatoes. I ended up eating half for dinner and saving the rest for lunch the next day (it heated up well!). Moving on to the hummus and pita - I wish I'd taken a photo because the portion was enormous. EONS is so generous with portions, which I've found to be rare. The hummus itself was nothing to write home about, pita chips were crispy and delicious.EONS has become my #1 go-to for ordering Greek in the city. Give them a try!"

I thought this level of guest service died years ago. I'm so glad I found this location and will frequent again, you should too!!!"

765,Kh0-HmlgmVUkRxR55_Vn1g,4/20/2022,5 star rating,Wanted to try halal on my vacation to NY and heard great things about this place. The food and kind service did not disappoint. Large portions of flavorful meat and even got a complimentary dessert for my birthday. Best gyro I've had so far. Definitely must try on your visit to NY

I guess the magic word was lamb...I love lamb although I've seen gyros for 20 years i never had one,where do i begin the homemade bread is hot and delicious the sandwich itself is just nasty somehow it tasted fishy but there's no fish on the menu,it was salty and had almost no white sauce on it.Anyone who's reading this please save your money as this stuff is really,really nasty...i feel sorry for the people Â who purchased a lamb gyro diner at 13.95 or 19.95If i come again i would order a falafel,although at 8.00 plus tax it's pretty pricey,they also serve French fries at 4.50 and rice at 4.50.The drink options include Turkish soda,aryan,snapple and water..Save your money unless you truly dont like good food.Servers are very nice and polite"

Full of flavor and HUGE. I can literally eat it for 2 meals and still have leftovers.Mix Gyro Dish with rice was just as good. Meats were so tender with explosive flavors. HUGE portions that can well over feed 2 grown men.I also ordered Hummus and their Homemade Bread. They were super fresh and just PERFECT as a side dish.Give them a chance - let's keep this joint alive!

Honestly we love the food ( mixed donner sandwich and their falafel is our favorite to go!!! Omg the falafel is so crunchy Â and so flavorful!! And there are always way more meats that I've expected in my sandwich!! My partner is vegetarian and he always eats the falafel dish there now haha ). Â The owner is always soooo friendlly for a chat and a quick catch up in life, that's what touches my heart after this past year with pandemic, truly this is what neighborhood business should be! We truly enjoy their food and business ( they are always our default cozy dinner option!) and we are super Â grateful to find them open around the corner for us!"

773,01yxzi0-hms5C5oZpOdSyw,9/16/2018,1 star rating,"Here goes... I've been here a couple of times already, and I did not like my prior times. However, I believe in second and third chances if certain people in my group really vouch for them. This was one of those times. I was with two other girls who stopped in for a drink. We sat at the bar. It wasn't packed on a Saturday at 10:30PM. There were two birthday parties that were being tended to and one or two single people at the bar and then us. FLAG #1 - We ordered three drinks (mojito . cranberry vodka, and an IPA). According to my friends, all they tasted was juice, and they usually get the same drink everywhere they go so this was one red flag. MY IPA was fine. It tasted like beer. FLAG #2 - The second red flag was when I was handed the check. The prices were fine... HOWEVER, they included tax (normal) and TIP (OK INTERESTING...). So ideally, tip is based on the PRETAX amount. Based on the receipt, 6.75/31 = 21.8% which is an ALMOST 22% TIP! In my opinion, the service wasn't very good and per my friends, the drinks were more juiced based, so an almost 22% tip was definitely NOT WARRANTED... but I let it go and paid. NOW, onward to FLAG #3FLAG #3 - When I received the check back for me to sign, I noticed the receipt confirmation was not for the same $40 I had seen before... Instead it was for $514!....It turns out, the waitress/bartender/attender charged me for one of the parties table that was there. I honestly don't know how it was possible for her to charge me the wrong receipt especially since the other receipt wasn't there when I got it back. I told her and she realized what was wrong and sorted it out by voiding the first receipt. She later said that the second round of drinks would be complimentary on her HOWEVER, it seemed like she also was lowkey waiting a long time to give us the drinks in hopes that she wouldn't have to give them to us. In the end, one of my friends had to mention it before the waitress who did my sale to ask the OTHER WAITRESSES to help her give us the drinks WHICH WERE ALSO MADE UP OF ENTIRLEY OF JUICE AGAIN.The positives are that it's a super chill place as its usually not crowded, has great music (DJs after a certain time), and has pretty waitresses. Downsides are the MANDATORY ALMOST 22% tip gratuity, lack of service, and pricey food options. They actually revamped their menu as it's more latino fusion and includes items like jalea, etc.Overall, my friend who vouched for this place also realized that after last night that she wouldn't go there again. I would not recommend for first timers either."

The bouncers are like family and the owner is always present, which to me, makes for good business. This is me and my girls' favorite hang out location. The drinks are awesome.

The dressing that came with the salad was so flavorful! I wish I could have a whole bottle of it! Plus the croutons and large chunks of tempeh made it very filling and tasty!The pasta was as comforting of a food as it gets! It must be about a half pound of spaghetti PLUS two chick'n parm cutlets on top. My mouth is watering just thinking of the few bites I took.

They offer delicious and filling Latin American dishes that are all vegan, with lots of gluten-free options (including items that can be modified to be gluten-free), including some gluten-free desserts as well.Much of it is not exactly healthy - a lot of items are fried and/or use a fair amount of oil or vegan cheese. But there are a few healthier options to choose from as well! But I've come here knowing that I wasn't looking for healthy food, and looking for vegan comfort food instead. And my love of Latin American food makes it that much more exciting.I finally got to have their vegan Nachos Supreme on my last visit! (I'm a sucker for good vegan nachos.) Lots of guacamole, salsa, black beans, vegan cheese, and vegan sour cream! And amazingly, the tortilla chips somehow stayed crunchy even at the end of the meal, even after sitting underneath all those toppings.I've also had their Avocado BLT and the Spinach Burritos on their gluten-free wrap, which I guess isn't as big as their wheat tortillas and doesn't fold or roll very well, because the fillings just sit inside the gluten-free wrap folded in half over it. You can't pick it up like a regular burrito and I've had to eat it with a fork and knife to prevent making a huge mess. But they were DELICIOUS, so it didn't matter to me how I needed to eat it. And I actually quite enjoy the gluten-free wrap (which I think is made from rice primarily?) - it's kind of chewy, which I find to be a very enjoyable texture for a wrap.Service was fine the last time I went with a group of friends, but it was relatively early in the evening before they would have been busy with the dinner rush, so they weren't crowded. But one time I ate there by myself, during dinner, it did take a while to get my order taken, but once my server finally came over to me, it wasn't an unreasonable wait to get my food.Definitely will be coming back when I'm in the neighborhood! There are so many more things on the menu that I want to try!"

The first time I went I got the Vspot burrito and it was good. They serve it with a salad and dressing. I wanted to try the nacho supreme and tacos next. So I went back the next week and got the carne molida and grilled chik'n tacos as well as the nachos. They were also very mediocre. The nacho chips were a bit too oily and there weren't enough toppings. The tacos were alright. The carne molida was better in my opinion than the grilled chik'n. The price was a bit too pricey for the food quality. If I were to go back or for anyone going for the first time, I would definitely go with the Vspot burrito."

I myself was a little skeptical about eating Vegan food at first but said why not give it a try. I'm glad that I did! The servers were amazing I forgot to ask them their names but they were super friendly and accommodating.

My son enjoyed his Avocado BLT....it was a decent portion ... he immediately said ""Mom, can we come back next week?"" lol. I brought a sparkly candle so We can sing Happy Birthday to my brother. So I asked one of the waiters if he didn't mind bringing out a slice of carrot cake and light the candle for me .....they delivered!!!!!Both waiters came out and sang Happy birthday making the experience extra special. I will definitely come back as the V Spot understood the assignment. P.S. My brother wanted me to add that since most of the food are fried they should use Avocado oil, Coconut oil or Olive Oil.

I had been wanting to check this place out for a while, not because of the jazz but because they had Japanese comfort food, at a reasonable price. I hadn't before because I don't normally venture to this neighborhood.On the first visit, I came with my friend at 5:30 and there was already a line outside the door. They don't accept ressos. We waited maybe about half hour? For drinks I had the Zen (homemade green tea vodka, triple sec, syrup, matcha powder, lemon peel, and nutmeg). I didn't love it as it was a little too bitter for me. I also had the lemon drop, which was too sweet for me. For food, shared the crab cream croquette, seasoned octopus with wasabi, cod roe spaghetti, and omurice. I'm really glad we shared everything because eating any of these one dishes alone would have been too heavy. The crab cream croquette was good but I didn't taste any crab in there. The octopus had too much wasabi. The cod roe spaghetti and omurice were my favorite. Very saucy and what I would expect of Japanese comfort food.On the second visit, I came w my husband, sister and her BF since they too have been wanting to check it out for a while. This time, it was a Thursday at 5:30 and again, there was a line. I can only imagine the line when it gets to prime dinner time or perhaps a Friday/Saturday night (FYI, there is a cover charge Fri/Sat/Sun) - so come early and on a weekday if you can. This time, we had the Berkshire sausages, curry, corn, and shrimp croquettes, fried rice, cod roe udon, and omurice. The sausages were kind of like mini smoky hot dogs. The croquettes came out perfectly fried again but they all tasted similar. Fried rice was standard and the stars of the show were yet again the cod roe udon and the omurice. I think I prefer the udon over the spaghetti because it seems to soak up more sauce. For drinks, I had some plum wine cocktail (didn't love this) and the Echigo beer (stout) - can't go wrong with a beer! If none of these drinks interest you, there are plenty of others to choose from, including a long sake list. It's a full bar so they can make you anything you want. As for the jazz, I'm not really a jazz fan but it was cool to listen to some live music while eating dinner. The vibe is very much speakeasy. It's also a small place so you will most likely be sharing a table with strangers. Both times, we were led to the back, where you can't see the band but by the time the main courses came, someone would come and ask if we wanted to move to the front, so that was really nice of them. Also the first time we came was a belated birthday celebration for me and my friend surprised me with having the band play happy birthday!Overall, I didn't love the cocktails, but I loved the food and the atmosphere."

I went by today at 5:30 PM and only had to wait 30 minutes to get in. This restaurant is quaint, dim, and eclectic. Initially my friend and I were seated in a back room, away from the view of the band, but we still heard the music loud and clear. Half way through our dinner, we had to chance to move to a prime spot right by the band, as my friend said, we had the best seat in the house! I had the edamame, curry croquet, and curry omurice. The curry croquet was perfectly fried and the sauce was a nice compliment. For the omurice, I loved the egg as it was light, silky, and fluffy and was complimented well by the curry. Overall the food was delicious and glad that it didn't break the bank!Only thing keeping this establishment from being 5 stars is that the space itself was a little too cramped. The seating configurations were also kind of awkward. Depending on where you are placed, you might not get to see the band!"
815,lUpyqsKw-IBqsMgYIHZj7Q,10/21/2022,5 star rating,"Tomi Jazz deserves a lot more recognition! We ended up here as an afterthought on our last night in NYC, and it ended up being one of the best dining experiences of not just our trip (which included various Michelin restaurants), but of our entire year. It was a very memorable time filled with top notch food, drinks, and conversation. If looking for a cool restaurant to go to, Tomi Jazz is definitely one of the best options in the area.With a speakeasy vibe and cozy setting, the ambience here is one of my all-time favorites (of any restaurant/bar that I've been to). Located in the basement of a brownstone, the atmosphere is dark, intimate, and simply unrivaled. The decor is visually tantalizing, leaving a lot to take in. This is the perfect spot for a low-key date or hangout. The service was also impeccable. Extremely friendly and accommodating.The food menu is ultimately what pushed us to come, but Tomi Jazz ended up being so much more. Everything we ordered was delicious and flavorful, and prices were more than reasonable for the quality. I can't recall everything we ordered at this point, but some of the dishes included Seasoned Octopus with Wasabi ($5), Mapo Tofu ($9), Vinegar Marinated Jellyfish ($9), and Stir-Fried Cod Roe Udon ($14).I was really looking forward to trying the Yuzu Shio Ramen ($14), but unfortunately, it was sold out. That said, everything available ended up being excellent. The Tako Wasabi (one of my favorite foods) was maybe the best I've had. The drink menu was also way beyond expectations. World-class cocktails, spirits, and refreshing beer. This was the ultimate NYC experience. I highly recommend this spot to all!"

From the moment you step inside, you're transported to a cozy and intimate world of live jazz music and delicious drinks.The atmosphere is simply magical - it's the perfect spot for a date night or a night out with friends. The live jazz music is always top-notch, and the small space makes for an intimate and memorable experience. The bartenders are also incredibly talented, and they make some of the best cocktails I've ever had.But the star of the show here is the food. The Japanese small plates are absolutely incredible, with a range of flavors and textures that are both familiar and unexpected. The sushi rolls are expertly crafted, and the karaage chicken is some of the best I've ever had. And the prices are reasonable, especially considering the high quality of the food and the live music.The service here is also exceptional - the staff is friendly, attentive, and always willing to offer recommendations. And the owner, Tomi, is often present and happy to chat with guests and make them feel welcome.Overall, Tomi Jazz is a must-visit spot for anyone looking for an unforgettable night of live jazz music, delicious drinks, and incredible Japanese small plates. It's an experience you won't soon forget. 10/10, would absolutely recommend."

I'm not much of a jazz listener, but the live performance last Sunday night was impressive to me. And don't ask me how long we waited. It wasn't fun, because some people were just obnoxiously loud. But once you were in, you'd be pleased. Â It just had that kind of atmosphere, you know, that certain je ne sais quoi... Â We were seated at the back facing a very rustic buffet table. How cool would that be, if it were an old bookshelf filled with books and some jazz vinyls. Â This place is super tiny, I mean it. You'd feel a part of the next table's convo. (Not really, they were talking in Hangul). I also wish my kids could speak Tagalog, but I clearly failed there.The wait staff was so efficient, moving like clockwork without rushing you. Â And the food was what I would call, Japanese comfort food. Â Corn, shrimp and crab meat croquettes. I favor the crab meat best. When space opened up near the front, they asked if we wanted to move. So we did. Â You could tell they wanted you to have a nice time. Â We were then seated close to the musicians and I thought the pianist was entertaining. With or without the live performance though, your meal will be a memorable pleasure.Tenshidon- oh dear! The pudding-like crab meat omelette over rice with a savory, glossy sauce is gold and the Japanese Curry sauce was my second favorite. It would be nice to try their honey toast for dessert or the matcha ice cream, but my waistline had expanded to the max. One night weeks ago, my son came home late and said, ""Mom, you need to try this place called 'tomijazz'. I think you'd love it"".He was spot on."

Many of the small plates like croquettes and baked chikuwa with mozzarella are great for sharing as well. Remember to save room for dessert!! The honey bread box is perfect to end the meal with. Would line up again to try the okonomiyaki. DRINKS: Try the cocktails. Wonderful selection. There's also a whole wall of alcohol you can choose from!AMBIANCE: I absolutely adore this place and it was worth waiting for despite the rain showers. The line started at 4:30pm and they opened at 5. My friend and I rushed here after work and made it 3rd in line. Can't complain. We had great seats and the love music started at 6pm. The seating is tight inside but you don't really feel cramped bc of how they did the layout. There's also a bar area inside for bar top seating. The jazz music over food is just perfect. It's not too loud where you can't have a conversation either. SERVICE: They really did an amazing job to create an experience for their patrons. They staggered on the time when seating each group, so just because they opened at 5pm, it doesn't mean everyone who's in line got to rush in. It was calm and you can take your time to take your coat off and settle in. Calmness is rare in this city!"
820,lUpyqsKw-IBqsMgYIHZj7Q,9/22/2022,4 star rating,"I really enjoyed every element of this place from the concept, the homey venue, the eclectic decors, the food, and the live jazz. But, one major flaw is the incredibly long and unpredictable wait time...So do take this into consideration when deciding to go there. We stood outside for 2 hours without a clue about what's going on inside, and this was on a Monday night. The person only popped out of the door to take in 1 party at a time. We saw many people left as it's hard to know when they'd get in. The number of people leaving and that of people being let in didn't match whatsoever so I'm not sure how they manage their seatings and guess.Anyhow, if and when you make it inside, the experience was pleasant. It felt like you're transported into a secret location that's cozy and romantic. The lighting and low ceiling played a big part in that. They do have daily live jazz which made the experience even more enticing.Food was sort of tapas style. Smaller appetizers with a few Japanese-Western fusion pasta and larger plates. Their cocktails are also Asian-inspired and totally delicious. The Fried Brie and Crab Cream Croquettes were freshly made and surprisingly light. Great starters. For our mains, we split the Avocado Pasta and Omlette Rice. Both of which was tasty. The pasta had a strong dashi taste which was very novel for me. They also had bonito flakes on top. The omlette rice came with fluffy Japanese omlette that was nicely gooey and tender. The hiyashi sauce complemented the egg and rice very well.We made the 2-hour wait worth it by ending the meal with a Honey Toast with Green Tea Ice Cream and Red Beans. Super pretty and a great treat (although I'd say it can use more honey and butter).To me this was a worth it experience, mainly because I went in with the right mindset. A 2-hour wait meal is not going to be your regular go-to but maybe for a special occasion this is a great place to celebrate and bring people."

The other day, while I was walking by, there was no line, so I finally got to try it!Coming in for the first time, it feels very exclusive. You ring the doorbell of a very unassuming door on a level below the sidewalk. You walk in, passed some curtains, and it finally makes sense why there is always a line wrapping around the block--the place is tiny. The tables are crammed around the piano and playing area in such a way that make it feel very intimately close to the live performers. In total, I don't think the place could fit more than 35 people. The ambience is what you'd expect of a small jazz club--amazing. Intimate and groovy. The musicians were really good, and the food matched that energy. Curry Omurice, fish roe pasta, and croquettes, all super delicious, and all deserve to be reordered the next time I come back.100% would recommend trying this place. If you pass by and the line is not too long--wait a bit, it'll be worth it."

I've never been disappointed. An absolute GEM, the aura of the place is absolutely unmatched. If you like soft peaceful jazz, if you like creative renditions of Japanese late night snacks, if you like the warmth of dim and romantic small spaces, come here!! It's worth the slightly disorganized and slightly inefficient / suspenseful wait in line. Tomi -- a little hidden speakeasy-esque japanese jazz bar that has the strappings of warmth and greatness!!! i think this is my favorite ambience ive experienced in nyc thus far; pics don't do it justice. if haruki murakami lived in the states im of the mind that this would be his hangout. laid back and candlelit, dreamy jazz, delicious cod roe pastas and omurices, yakult cocktails, kitschy and avant-garde surroundings -- the recipe for an extremely atmospheric night. wish it was easier to come -- no reservations, but I guess that matches tomi's unpretentious identity :P"

This is what led me to Elsewhere and, concurrently, my first concert in Brooklyn.I did a little research on Elsewhere before heading out to Brooklyn - mostly having to do with commute. I decided to drive instead of take the train since the latter option would require a few transfers and a few reviews here on Yelp stated it's relatively easy to find parking. They were right - Elsewhere is in a mostly industrial area and I found a spot right around the corner from the venue. After going through the usual admission process (wristband, ticket scan, ID, etc.), I made my way inside. From what I could tell, there seem to be a few different sections of Elsewhere, but I was in the Hall - ie. a large open area with a stage. Like the neighborhood, it has a sort-of industrial look to it, but done up nice for performances and such. The space was could probably hold a hundred or so people - and there's a bar in the back which was a nice feature. As far as the concert itself, I had a great time - acoustics were good, and even though it's standing room only, there was adequate space to move around. Staff was great - check-in was fast as was service at the bar. Overall, Elsewhere was a fun experience and provided a great environment to have a show."

Very grateful that parking is so easy in this area, we found a spot right out front. You can trust the bar to have a good selection of craft beers, but don't bother with mixed drinks - they barely pour any liquor in. Plenty of stalls in the women's bathroom, so there was never a wait even in between opening sets. Would definitely come back for other upcoming shows!"

There's a sign that reads:No Sexual HarassmentNo Acts of Aggression (Including Leering)No RacismNo Misogyny...and this all holds true as you're met with a cheerful, friendly crowd. The space is decently sized, with a main stage room accompanied by a back room past the smoking section. There's also a rooftop: not too sure on the details here as it was closed this particular night (maybe because it was raining).Definitely suggest checking this spot out."

Sound is pretty good, layout is spacious, and there are several areas to sit down comfortably when you need to take a break. The upstairs bar area and outdoor smoking zone are both much more inviting than most other venues' equivalent chill zones. The vibe is a little off for techno nights in my opinion, but overall Elsewhere does a nice job of straddling that difficult line between nightclub and rock venue. It definitely beats The Good Room. Also, it's in a funny corner of Morgantown/Jefftown where you can watch college kids get lost and cry when they step outside and lose their friends. Great fun!"
829,Q02uPdw8j8yDIVSPyJATjA,8/8/2021,1 star rating,"so like, i'm with my brother for the first time in months, and we were passionate to watch a jlin performance; genuinely interested in watching this performer, and it's something we bond over. it's a night we were looking forward to, and i think we deserved it for working soul-crushing jobs and dealing with the apathy of covid-19; we needed the release.so here's the issue that i had with the venue, in this particular night.the venue didn't advertise the times for when the performers got on stage. i got in by 11pm, and i just figured out that jlin was coming on at 2am. i had to learn this as by going in to the venue. granted, the venue showcased the time from like 10pm-4am online, but at least show the times that the performers will perform; otherwise, i might come in early, and then deal with the arbitrary ""no reentry"" rule (which, if we look deep into it, is a seriously racist and/or classist rule).as for security and their ""no reentry"" rule: to be fair, yea they had signs that said ""no reentry."" but the signs were small, and i think you have to be atypically alert to see these signs. either that. or you gotta come in prepared to be looking out for no reentry signs. or you had to be fortunate enough to lay your eyes on that sign. plus i take it in good faith that 32$ ticket prices would allow reentry.on the bouncers and their response as racist gatekeepers: after some cajoling, i pulled some strings and got myself Â onto a guest list, and urged the security (some guy who who was the human embodiment of a Lugz boot, and perhaps a 30-something girl with an ear piercing) to look that up. they were quite staunch on the ""no reentry."" no lie, as soon as i was seen coming back and walking around the stanchion, this guy was barking at me, ""don't even try it! turn around."". bro was ego-trippin'. my bro and i were simply insisting to check the guest list. we didn't harass, we weren't snobby, we weren't childish by any degree; so nah, the emerging aggression from this meathead was unnecessary.beer prices wild high too. 18$ for two brooklyn lagers.so what, elsewhere puts up shows without venue slots, has unsuspecting people show up to drink their expensive drinks and blow out their ears just to wait 3 hours? if i did that, that would indicate an unbalanced personality.so yeah, probably the worst experience i had at a show. bro and i got into a whole discussion about this, and related some ideas about the boujiness of the area. whatever the case may be, this experience ruined the place for me and probably revealed, on a surface level, some (racist, colorist, classist, also misogynist (how ya'll got ain't address some transparency-type questions on the rape allegations of one of your investors?)) inequities of the entire district. #DanceAnywhereElse"

Since the register was literallyyy next to our table, I asked the worker if she could take our order when she was at the register. She looked and even sounded super irritated and said ""you order up here!"". Didn't think it made a difference whether or not I stay seated as I placed our order, since my seat was literally next to the register. As my friends and I were socializing, we noticed that the worker dropped a stack of UNWRAPPED (to-go) paper cups on the ground. She then picked it back up, and placed next to the rest of the UNWRAPPED paper cups that were resting on a vacant booth where the customers were jusssssst sitting. Definitely glad I didn't get my coffee to-go at that point, but that also made me wonder whether or not my cup was even clean."

They need to make it clear, put ropes or SOMETHING to avoid the chaos. Finally, their cold brew tastes like water which was extremely disappointing and they always forget your drink. Their system for calling it out to each other with no other form of recording it always leaves people waiting forever for their drinks and being asked multiple times what they are waiting for.

Went to sit on the upstairs level at the front overlooking the store which was great for people watching.What's cool about this place is that everything is made fresh daily with organic and natural products. No additives or extra preservatives, which can cause all types of problems to our bodies. They use local suppliers for their products. At the end of the day they donate leftover food to City Harvest which is a wonderful charity. Also, it is in a great location in Union Square."

853,bB8dHfAEJrF5tNcHr0yJjA,1/20/2022,4 star rating,"Came here for brunch and it was a pretty good experience. When we entered, we sat down and got the menus. While they don't have an unlimited option, their brunch drinks are pretty cheap so not a super big concern. I got a gin and grapefruit juice for $6 and a bloody mary for $7. On Sundays they also had a deal on their frozen drinks all day for $7. Seems like they have some pretty good happy hour and daily specials as well. That being said, the drinks are a bit on the smaller side but still tasted pretty good (maybe a little weak). For food I had the arepas benedictos. The plate was massive. The short rib was delicious and tender. The arepas were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The salad, potatoes and peppers were also a nice touch. The service is like extremely present when you don't need anything and then goes missing when you need a drink. The staff is super friendly though and they always kept our waters filled. A great place if you want to have a drink or two with a friend aren't going crazy. That being said, the space is big and they have a nice outdoor area as well if you were to bring a big party here. They also have a nice back area that could fit a decent number of people. When we started brunch at around 12:30 it was pretty quiet and a cozy environment. However, around 1:30 they started playing music really loudly even though it was still fairly empty. It was a little aggressive. Overall, a pretty good experience. Will try to check out some of their other specials if I'm in the area!"

The most annoying part was the foam on my regular cup of coffee. The churrasco was cooked to perfection and flavorful. Pernil al estilo mojo- delicious. Bursting with flavors. This was probably/ most likely slow cooked. It's extremely tender. Has a hint of lemon flavor which I love ! The arepa cups were two bites full each which were perfect. I would have loved some green sauce on it or aioli of some sort. I was surprised they did not have yuca fries here the way they do at their Vernon location.

Discounted margaritas are offered until 7pm. 2 for 1 mojitos are offered all day on Tuesdays! I had a coconut mojito which was ok but could've been colder. I prefer their margaritas. The frozen Mango Margarita was bomb and not too sweet like a typical frozen drink. The spicy orchard is a spicy margarita, HEAVY on the spice. It was too spicy for my liking. I had the fried shrimp as an appetizer. The shrimp were fried hard (not by request but it happens to be how I like it). For my meal I had Pork Chops with rice & black beans. The meal was good, generous portion with more than enough for a to go bag."

We came on a Tuesday for the taco Tuesday special that was $40 for unlimited margaritas, beers and tacos for 90 mins. The service was pretty decent but you have to make sure you order fast and you're on top of them to get your money's worth. I recommend getting the draft beer only because the margaritas weren't strong at all. They played good music and the vibe was A1! Definitely a great Spanish party vibe. Would I return? Yes but not for taco Tuesday probably. I want to order from the regular menu."

I wanted red beans but they don't serve them. Our waiter was very pleasant and attentive. The decor and ambiance isn't bad, not a lot of space between diners, the tables are to close.I would return to try another entree.

From the moment we walked in the vibe here was amazing. We were seated quickly & our waitress attended to us almost immediately. We ordered some drinks one of which was a ""Pina Colada"" that was way too sweet for me. They premake their Pina Coladas so I basically couldn't ask for it to be made over so my hubby knowing me so well decided to pick something that he knew I would like. He chose ""La Paloma"" & I believe the other drink we had was ""Caipirinha"" both were really good, made perfectly. I ordered the Churassco grilled marinated skirt steak with white rice, beans & tostones. When I say this steak was AMAZINGLY full of flavor & so good, it might just be an understatement. Definitely, a must-have if you visit Blend!"

To me it felt like the latter. Theater was the main attraction and I felt weird sitting there with my coffee. The place was packed! The crowds of people waiting in such a tiny space left no room for personal space. The cafe was unbearably loud with baristas yelling out orders, theater staff yelling out instructions, and loud chatters among the waiting crowd. The cafe itself is poorly decorated with awkward seating arrangements. The drinks are over priced too($4.50 for americano and average of $4 for tea). I definitely wouldn't come here to meet up friends or work/study. Coffee is decent so maybe take out coffee if overpriced coffee is your thing. Sadly, there are too many other coffee shops around here with quality coffee and relaxing atmosphere to come back to this place."
870,Z5FKUxsLDi5LznSrmH-ISg,7/3/2020,1 star rating,"I walked up and the owner/manager was too busy chatting with someone to help me and rudely told me to wait (despite the fact I was the only customer). No visible menu or prices (would be easy to tape these to the plastic pane) and was not told how much my drink was at any point before they asked me to pay. They then asked to leave a tip, I said no because of the above rudeness and they didn't tell me how much the drink was so I had no frame of reference for tipping. I paid, then a minute or two later the owner/manager then came out from behind the bar and accosted me about not leaving a tip, calling it ""unacceptable"" and wanting to ""have a conversation"". I saw this was going nowhere good and really just wanted my coffee, so I paid the extra $0.50.I understand this is a difficult time and wages are dependent on tips, but there are many better ways to approach this. For example, they could raise prices slightly or put up a little sign that says ""please tip your barista!"" with some info about why it is important. Less confrontational methods would have been a lot more effective. If I had seen a sign like that, I would have tipped even though the service was not good because I completely understand with the financial impact COVID has had.I think it's really important to support small businesses right now. I will still be doing so, just not this one."

I called the store and spoke with Sara again, who offered no ETA on my order nor any compensation for the extreme delay. She was rude and argumentative.

What I don't like is that for some reason their ice cream machines are always broken. The day I went on a weekend, there was no more napkins, people weren't allowed into the bathrooms, there were no more ketchup cups, the fries couldn't be made fast enough to keep up. I'm not sure why they can't just give us the food immediately after the order. Not only that, they can't deliver the orders correctly and there were multiple complaints of missing or wrong items.

Mind you this is one company that delivers the same product to all their restaurants, so it makes you wonder whats going on in each one to make them as bad as they are. Some of them are ultra salty while others are super greasy. And please don't get me started on whats really inside each of their products. lol you get what you pay for IMO.

I placed a ordered a full meal with my wife and we waited almost 30 mins to get our order she was very upset just as much as I was. The orders in the back was backed up a lot because they are arguing over what's the easiest thing to make first. They were going from order 280 to 258 to 271 to 250 etc not going in order. Next my order is being made and we asked for a snack wrap with no sauce where the cook who makes it replied I don't know what this is tell them we can't do this to the girl and she replied how to make the wrap and he said you are not my boss. His boss walked over and still told him what to do where he cook replied I'm not stupid bro. It took him an additional 15 mins to make the whole order where he just threw everything sloppy together. Everything was cold as hell when I got home and had to be heated of course and then on top of that I got a stomach virus from the food not being prepared well.

I walked to our table expecting everything to be inside but when we took the food out, the fries were missing. When I walked back and asked for my fries, I was told it was because I ""ran away"" but they needed to fill two new packets. If it was because I ran away, wouldn't it be already made and ready to pick up? Not to mention, the man that made it had terrible manners and didn't even fill it up all the way. I paid for large fries, not a medium. When I asked for some ranch sauce, I was given only one packet because they ""had no more"". I could see that behind them they had a whole row full of it.

The guy shows up to deliver the food on a bike with 1 burger (not double cheeseburger) 1 large fries and a soda where the ice was just about melted. I was furious because we didn't get the order and we paid about $60 on that piece of shit. We called the McDonalds, they picked up and hung up several times. When I was able to speak to the young lady she said we don't use postmates, that's not our problem smh she put me on hold for 30 minutes while she laughed and giggled with her friends at work and we heard the entire conversation. I called back several times and they picked up or hung up on me or just let the phone ring out. I called postmates and they credit me $32 knowing damn well what we received was no where near $20 and then I called the bank to stop that process. I contacted McDonalds the next day and I spoke to a guy who said when we run out, we give the postmates whatever we have smh so if someone orders $60 worth of food nobody thinks its a good idea to call the customer? anyway, as we was talking on the phone, he also hung up on me.

Dollar menu stuff are no longer a dollar even for it's sweet tea. 2 apple pies for a dollar is nowhere to be found and the McChicken tasted like crap. Just a soggy chicken patty.

What I do like is that the prices are relatively cheap compared to the ones in the city. For example, the McChicken sandwich is only $1.19 each whereas one in the city would cost almost double. What I don't like is that for some reason their ice cream machines are always broken. The day I went on a weekend, there was no more napkins, people weren't allowed into the bathrooms, there were no more ketchup cups, the fries couldn't be made fast enough to keep up. I'm not sure why they can't just give us the food immediately after the order. Not only that, they can't deliver the orders correctly and there were multiple complaints of missing or wrong items. I don't understand how one item can take 30 minutes to deliver..."

905,pFrxezxzly8wqSJPIG7Ptw,3/3/2013,2 star rating,"McDonald's is just one of those fast food chains that stopped caring about certain markets. NY is one of those markets. I have been to McDonald's down south as far as Florida and as far out as Vegas and in those markets you get what you see on T.V. in quality and freshness. Mind you this is one company that delivers the same product to all their restaurants, so it makes you wonder whats going on in each one to make them as bad as they are. Some of them are ultra salty while others are super greasy. And please don't get me started on whats really inside each of their products. lol you get what you pay for IMO. Some people fall prey to their ad's and how heavy it's pushed through the media. Sorry but when it's the truth it is what it is."

907,pFrxezxzly8wqSJPIG7Ptw,6/30/2016,1 star rating,Can I give less than 1 star ? Maybe not possible but this place is the worst place to go. First off the staff is all fully ghetto and disrespectful. I placed a ordered a full meal with my wife and we waited almost 30 mins to get our order she was very upset just as much as I was. The orders in the back was backed up a lot because they are arguing over what's the easiest thing to make first. They were going from order 280 to 258 to 271 to 250 etc not going in order. Next my order is being made and we asked for a snack wrap with no sauce where the cook who makes it replied I don't know what this is tell them we can't do this to the girl and she replied how to make the wrap and he said you are not my boss. His boss walked over and still told him what to do where he cook replied I'm not stupid bro. It took him an additional 15 mins to make the whole order where he just threw everything sloppy together. Everything was cold as hell when I got home and had to be heated of course and then on top of that I got a stomach virus from the food not being prepared well. I will never order from this place again in my life this is a horrible place to eat from.

I ordered two large fries for my family to share in addition to some drinks, McChickens, McNuggets, apple pies, and so forth so when they finally called my number, they gave me a large paper bag with food inside. I walked to our table expecting everything to be inside but when we took the food out, the fries were missing. When I walked back and asked for my fries, I was told it was because I ""ran away"" but they needed to fill two new packets. If it was because I ran away, wouldn't it be already made and ready to pick up? Not to mention, the man that made it had terrible manners and didn't even fill it up all the way. I paid for large fries, not a medium. When I asked for some ranch sauce, I was given only one packet because they ""had no more"". I could see that behind them they had a whole row full of it. I am completely upset with their service and will be purchasing from KFC next time."

Â  It's dangerous to go in there.This McDonald's asks what sauce I wanted with my McNuggets and actually put them in without forgetting. Great job.This place seems understaffed. Even with no one on line before me, it still took a while to get my order because the only orders being handled were the drive-thru ones.The cleaning lady is very nice. While I was deciding on a drink she asked me if i needed help, twice. Lots of parking here. Barely any air conditioning.

We used postmates to order from them and we ordered:1 double cheeseburger, 3 large fries 20 piece nugget1 large soda and the order came out to $57. That was already extremely overpriced compared to uber eats and grub hubs $33 total for that same order but I said ""whatever"" nobody wanted to cook that night so here's where the story gets interesting. The guy shows up to deliver the food on a bike with 1 burger (not double cheeseburger) 1 large fries and a soda where the ice was just about melted. I was furious because we didn't get the order and we paid about $60 on that piece of shit. We called the McDonalds, they picked up and hung up several times. When I was able to speak to the young lady she said we don't use postmates, that's not our problem smh she put me on hold for 30 minutes while she laughed and giggled with her friends at work and we heard the entire conversation. I called back several times and they picked up or hung up on me or just let the phone ring out. I called postmates and they credit me $32 knowing damn well what we received was no where near $20 and then I called the bank to stop that process. I contacted McDonalds the next day and I spoke to a guy who said when we run out, we give the postmates whatever we have smh so if someone orders $60 worth of food nobody thinks its a good idea to call the customer? anyway, as we was talking on the phone, he also hung up on me. So now, my next stop is corporate. I don't want to do it but it's unacceptable and after looking at these reviews I realize I'm not the only one sick and tired of their shit at this location."

They advertise their triple cheeseburger for $2.50 each but they charge a little more than that hoping that you don't notice. At first, I thought maybe they calculated the tax into the burger already but when I saw the receipt, the triple cheeseburger was already marked up and the sales tax was charged separately. Dollar menu stuff are no longer a dollar even for it's sweet tea. 2 apple pies for a dollar is nowhere to be found and the McChicken tasted like crap. Just a soggy chicken patty. No crispiness whatsoever and their fries are way too salty."

One a good day, the staffs would fill up your bowl/burrito/etc, on a bad day... you'll barely get enough to fill you up. Sometimes the services are super slow because the staffs would stop what they're doing and chit chat with each other... like hello?! people have to get their lunch and get back to work... There are times where the staffs can't hear you no matter how many times you have repeated your order. I have repeated myself three times before to ask for extra lettuce, but NOPE... I didn't get any. Like I said, on a good day, the staffs would give you two handful/spoonful. It's never consistent. This is not my favorite chipotle place, but it'll have to do since it's the closest one to my work place. FYI, there is ALWAYS a line out the door during lunch peak hours. ALWAYS."

929,jYjJNB9qlmd6dbYZBaDjfw,6/23/2016,3 star rating,This is probably one of the worst Chipotles I have ever been to. It never fails with them being out of one item or another. There is are always a lot of people so there should be anticipation and preparedness of the many customers coming in for lunch. Some of the workers are not pleasant. I asked for a side of guacamole and the young lady left a lot of space in the little container. When I asked her to fill up the space she decided to catch an attitude and put so much that when it closed it spilled over. Where she just wasted a that bit of guacamole. And then gives the customer behind me a heaping spoon on his bowl. Â The consistency is non-existent. Guacamole is $2.30 now def not cheap for a small amount. This location needs an overhaul. Of course the food is always good.
930,jYjJNB9qlmd6dbYZBaDjfw,5/19/2016,3 star rating,This location is pretty good but they are often out of various ingredients. Â There is also less seating than you will normally find at a Chipotle and most tables are high tops which are not super comfortable. There are two restrooms which is a plus.

I called & they apologize profusely and tell me that the delivery guy just forgot it and it bringing it by ""shortly"".Thirty minutes later and it still hasn't arrived. I call again - the phone receiver is obviously passed around when I say I am calling with an issue. When a woman finally gets on the phone, the first thing she says is ""I'll refund you!"" When I inquired as to the problem (with a lot of pushing!), she said that she couldn't guarantee anything and my colleague should just order something else for lunch. Well, good for you, Ashby's - you just got your selves blacklisted at our office and no one here will be ordering from you again.P.S.

I would prefer if they offered sliced bread or bagels for the sandwiches instead of just the roll or wrap option, but nonetheless, the food was good enough. Nothing too special but satisfied my morning hunger. For my lunch visit here, I went with a ham and cheese panini. I didn't enjoy it but it was my own fault for not ordering without mustard (which I despise)... but if you like mustard, they absolutely slopped it all over the sandwich. Ashby's offers something like 20+ sandwich options for lunch so there is certainly variety here.One huge negative is the lack of seating. I think there were 4-5 bar stools at the most. I'd suggest walking down one block and eating in the park if the weather is nice. Overall, Ashby's is a decent choice for breakfast."

The chicken was not dry and the mushrooms were juicy. I really enjoyed my meal! I'm not sure if it was just my tastebuds, but the water tasted a bit funky....so heads up on that.

The platters are better with the full Greek salad and fries.When having dinner at Page always check the special board at the front register. Their dinner specials are amazeballs...

They also have some baked goods. There's no calories listed for each item on the menu which was a slight drawback for me. They make each drink right when you order so it can take maybe 10 min to get your drink. I ordered the peaches and cream shake. It tasted pretty good although not as good as a real milkshake LOL. There was a strong cinnamon flavor that got in the way of the peach/vanilla flavor. My server probably just put too much. This shake replaced a meal for me (not sure if that's recommended though) and it was very filling. I was stuffed halfway through!

However, this time around I was shocked at the different.I ordered the chicken super burrito and the mezcal gimlet and my brother had the quesadilla. The super burrito was absolutely disgusting. The tortilla isn't soft, but also isn't crispy enough to hold all ingredients. Now let's talk ab out what's inside the burrito...a mess. It was a wet mix of chicken, sour cream, guac, etc. Overall, I literally ate 4 bites and let them throw it away. Definitely not worth $14. The mezcal gimlet came in a wine glass? And it was pretty overpowering but I still drank it. I don' think it was worst $13. My brother said the quesadilla wasn't good. He said he bought one from a local bodega that was better. The guacamole that came with the quesadilla was clearly older as it was pretty dark.The staff and atmosphere was good but overall I won't be coming back (unfortunately)."

While they offer all the staples of Mexican-American cuisine you would expect like tacos, burritos, enchiladas, and tamales, this does not disclose the diversity of their menu. They have very impressive brunch options, including gluten-free pancakes, an assortment of desserts, a great drinks menu, and plenty of side options. Their service is fast and friendly and they offer extensive outdoor seating that is comfortable and spacious. Chicken Tamales (4/5): Their tamales have a very authentic taste and are well presented. For the price, the portion could be larger and some pieces of chicken were a little dry. It comes with a side of rice and refried beans, both of which are above average. Super Burrito (4/5): Their super burrito is a little pricy and it is pretty big but not massive. I ordered mine with beef, rice, beans, guacamole, tomatoes, and cheese. Their flour tortilla tasted fresh as did the rest of the ingredients. It was filling but I wish it was a little bit larger. It comes with a side of beans and a simple salad. Any of their burrito options are solid, but if you want something big, I recommend ordering the Super Burrito. Good Mexican food is surprisingly hard to find in NYC. I think Lupe's is well above the average. Their chips, queso, and guacamole are all great, as are their rice and beans, simple items that are often overlooked at local Mexican restaurants. If you are craving classic Mexican fare, Lupe's is a casual and reliably tasty option in SoHo."

My boyfriend was craving a shrimp burrito and we found this spot on seamless. He got a super shrimp burrito, I got the chiles rellenos and we had guac to share. We also both got cocktails; he got a strawberry margarita (which is slushy) and I got the pineapple mojito. Delivery was prompt and everything was packaged well. My boyfriend LOVED his shrimp burrito. I was side-eyeing his order at first because the burrito was almost $20, but I think it was a good value - the shrimp were fresh and the meal was large. I really enjoyed the chile rellenos; the sides accompanying (rice / beans / lettuce & tomato) were fresh and the flavors complemented my meal well. I ate half for dinner and the other half for lunch. The chips were nicely roasted and salty, the guac was delicious. The presentation was cute on a bed of lettuce, but not very practical, as some of the dip was wasted getting stuck in the lettuce on the bottom. Lastly, the drinks! I'm hesitant to order cocktails from seamless, because they are generally tiny and not worth it. Not here! My mojito had a HEAVY pour and I could taste the fresh pineapple; it gave me a pleasant little buzz. My boyfriend's strawberry margarita was delicious and still frosty when it arrived. I'd definitely recommend this place. It has so many options for vegan / vegetarian / pescatarians and I think the food / drinks are a great value.

After getting the menus, they seemed to have forgotten about us, so had to ask for someone to come take our order.Settled on the Chili Colorado over brown rice ($13.25) and a cup of Cafe Caban ($8). The chili is a meaty broth with giant chunks of beef over well-cooked jasmine rice. Incredibly warming/filling meal, however the onions on top were just chopped over (would have preferred them grilled). The Cafe Caban is a normal latte with a honey liquor added inside. Fairly well balanced and not too sweet/boozy.Service got way better after our order was taken, and we got our food fairly fast. Seems like a solid place for breakfast/brunch as well."

I know Mexican food over here sucks but the name of the restaurant gave me some hope. Total let down. I ordered chilaquiles verdes with eggs. The sauce was basically Ortega bottled salsa Â poured over some tortilla strips. The eggs were fine I guess. It was served with black beans ..um..huh?? Â In East LA we eat refried pinto beans with our food. The best thing about this place is that they have bottled yucateco salsa Which is my favorite bottled chile.

The chicken looked like it had just been taken out of a bag of Tyson frozen chicken breast (the type you find at Costco). I don't remember what my friends got but I had a bite and it was terrible as well. THIS IS NOT AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD. I've had Tex-Mex more authentic than this stuff. I would not come here.

When I tried to pay, I gave them a $2 bill and some singles because that's all I had on me at the time, and he said, ""we don't accept this. Is this real?"" He looked at the bill like it was foreign currency. He consulted his coworker about it and ultimately, she decided that it was real because you can ""feel"" the ridges. I mean.. you can just use a counterfeit marker for crying out loud. When I asked how much it was, he just stared at me, and looked down for no reason, and looked back up at me, and looked back down. I had to ask him three times in a row how much it was. He held up a finger to me instead of saying, ""one moment.""

If there is an issue, she will assist you in the most convenient way possible, unlike the majority of the workers. I've been to this place many times (great deal on the soup/bagel), and every single time there has been an issue with something I order -- most of the time something was lost in translation, but there is definitely the lazy factor. The food is above average, and bagels are far above average, but it is an exhausting experience every time I come here. Also, pizza is not worth it, and a bagel with something + a salad will cost you around $20.00."

The mixed lettuce accidentally fell of the employee hands to the floor, she then picked it up and asked the custimer what topping she wants!!! Stating that it didnt fall on the floor.My order took literally half an hour because the cashier was cursing at someone who got her mad.I ended up leaving everything and left.Someone should really open another kosher bagel store around the area."

1013,Cx-obc_6ZIqr_d7uT7STfQ,5/19/2017,3 star rating,"Yummy Asian-inspired bowls for a quick and casual lunch/ dinner. There are suggested combinations, or you can create your own bowl! Almost like an Asian style chipotle. You can choose from a base of white/brown rice, quinoa or salad. Love the quinoa option. Then pick your protein (they have tofu for meatless option) and various veggies. Wish they had more greens. The tofu is fried so it isn't exactly a ""healthy"" option per se. The sauces are good- my spicy gochujang was pretty spicy and salty. A little too much sauce. I would ask for light on sauce next time. Portion size was quite generous. You order at the counter so it's pretty much a self-service place. Very little seating- probably seats 8 people total in there.I would come back if in the area for a quick dinner."

The meat was old, cold and dry... like it was waiting for hours. The brown rice was boring, and had no flavor. The vegetables had too much vinegar. The curry sauce was barely there. True, it was a huge bowl, but everything was wrong. It sure makes college students happy, but not me. Overall, a waste of $10."

Even though this spot is small, was able to snag a table while ordering up front.Several pre-made bowls to choose from, but gave the Create-Your-Own a go. Ordered the quinoa base, grilled chicken, mushrooms+broccoli, nuts, mangoes, scallions, sprouts, and teriyaki sauce ($10). Also got a Chrysanthemum Tea drink ($2) for the sake of novelty. The drink isn't half bad, just an odd flavoring of flower. Bowl is great; lots of meat and veggies topped onto the large serving of quinoa. Wish there was more sauce as it kind of settled towards the bottom - mixing if possible is a good idea. Guys behind the counter are efficient - getting your meal ready in about five minutes. More of a ""to-go"" kind of place, yet a solid option for a quick meal."

I was getting tired of the fast lucnh options around campus like Starbucks, McDonald's, dd, subway, bowllin, space market, dumpling kingdom, dining halls, cart food, just salad, etc. I really enjoy rice bowls so I decided to just search for rice bwols and this popped up and I couldn't be any happier! Just like most of the reviews mentioned, seating is very limited and the lines can get pretty long during lunch hour during the school year, but orders move pretty fast given how customized the bowls can be and how it's freshly made to order.The portions are VERY generous and prices are more than fair. It's cheaper than the bowl I'd get from Chipotle or even a salad from just salad so I'd definitely be back here to try all the combinations they offer."

The place is a hole in the wall with some room to sit. Nice & clean and looked new. Staff were friendly and informative. I had the following and and will say:California bowl - sweet, 60 percent rice. Tokyo bowl - raw / uncooked, couldn't finish. Like other reviewers state, not worth 10+ dollars for taste, but good portion amount, all the rice will definitely fill you up, skimmped on meat and not really cooked thoroughly."

They have a wholesome bowl with rice, chicken, prawns and tofu with amazing sauce and topping. The Bangkok is my favorite and I order it with extra tofu all the time! The flavors are fantastic and their tofu is the right kind of crunchy. I also tried their California bowl once but I believe they no longer give avocado as an option - which is fine given the other stuff is great!! I think the only thing that I find a little off is quinoa as a base is an extra 1.25 when all the other bowl places have that as a normal offerings. Not sure why that is."

I got the Singapore bowl which was fairly simple with rice, cucumber and ""grilled chicken breast"". The chicken was inedible. It was not chicken breast...possibly chicken thigh or some other dark meat? Not sure. In addition, the chicken was weirdly cooked with an odd appearance and disgusting texture. The pictures make the bowls look fantastic but the quality of the meat was well below that. My friend got a bowl with pork in it and he also thought it was disgusting and suspect."

They have poke bowls you can design yourself? They didn't have sashimi tuna as a ""protein"" selection and we were about to walk out but i said we wanted tuna that's why we were leaving, the cashier pointed to the specials board where it was listed. Also said we can add to tuna to our own bowl choices, we were happy and stayed. We thought they gave a very ample size of tuna and bowl ingredients. Although the choices seem slim, it was very good and fresh. A few tables are inside and were empty at the time around 830p. We liked and do recommend for your poke fix."

I thought ""ok, maybe it's just a bad day."" But today was the proof in the pudding that I needed. I only stopped by because I was in the area.The other reviewers are right. There will be food missing and that's just hella annoying.Anyway, what you came to read was about the food. Oxtails are just so regular no real flavor. The yams also seem like they just boiled it and that's it. It's like there was no type of sugar or nothing on it. To top it off you get one piece ..sooo stingy.The macaroni cheese is just so bland, soft and mushy. Maybe it's because older senior men are cooking but I don't know but just avoid this place.I give it two stars because you won't completely hate it. It's edible and prices are decent but TRUST me there's way better out there."

Cool, my daughter can tolerate a little bit of spice, but the chicken was super dry!!! I saw the guy pick the darkest (burned) piece for us. Moral of the story is, my favorite place to get Caribbean food is gone and I will never go back there again! The two piece of oxtail I ate (my daughter had the other two) were good but nothing spectacular like I'm used to from that place.

They do have patties but to me they are meh, just o.k. I will warn you, to me the jerk chicken is not hot, however it lit my friends mouth on fire ( i love spicy foods). Last but not least if you are in the mood for a treat get the curry goat. This dish can be messed up so easily and they do a pretty damn good job at making it great!The prices are reasonable and the staff friendly if not slow on some days.

If you're very picky, particular, and have sensory issues with food I would not recommend this restaurant unfortunately. They're not consistent with the way they prepare the food and have a hard time accommodating simple special instructions and requests! You're better off preparing your own meal at home. Oh yeah, and they're petty too--god forbid you ask for a seamless refund because they prepared your food wrong, the next time you order they will purposely screw up your food and not listen to your special instructions even though they've made your same order a bunch of times (a couple times incorrectly but STILL!) unacceptable. I have the easiest order ever and I know what they did tonight was sheer pettiness. And shoutout to the rude delivery guy who hung my bag of food on the front door of my building probably hoping it would get stolen. Don't order from here. Mediocre food and crappy people."

The salsa was warm and had giant chunks of onion, FYI. Unusual. Â We aren't particular either, we love chipotle, dos toros, all fast casual Mexican places. This just was NOT good and I won't return.

Always fresh, always consistent, staff always has a smile on their faces... it's really a take out place, but there are a couple of tables if you wanna cop a squat. I love the fish tacos and the Southwest Salad, but everything's good. Their grilled pork, to me, is next level. And the prices? Seems like they haven't changed in like 30 years. Go down Court Street and pay 18-25 bucks for an entree at some other joint, with a side of a grumpy attitude - or save your time and money and get behind a business that serves up yummy goods 6 days a week.

I had mentioned in the opentable reservation that we needed an outdoor table. When we arrived, the host informed us that the owner does not like big parties outside (we were 4 adults and 2 children below the age of 10). That was surprising because there were two families with the same exact profile already seated outside. When i pointed that fact out, i was informed by the host that he did not seat those families and they had been seated by a different server who would lose his job. I said that seems to be some profiling to which he answered the owner does not like large groups (remember it was only 4 adults and 2 children - just like the others already seated outside). I asked him if the profiling was based on how we looked Â to which he did not respond. We went to a different restaurant. On our way back we weren't surprised to see that there was another family with 2 adults and 3 children seated outside.

I usually come here for coffee but I decided to try out their food. I got the spicy beef sandwich which is very reminiscent of a Vietnamese style sandwich with a twist. They use onions, bean sprouts, cilantro, avocado, and onions on top of their special marinated beef. It's like taking some elements of pho, bahn mi, and a deli sandwich and when you combine all these you'll get the spicy beef sandwich at cafe one. There's always a loooong line because of the tight spacing here but good thing the staff are quick with orders cause I never really waited too long for my food. Coffee here is pretty standard, I usually get my Americano here when I need my caffeine fix to study.All in all, Good sandwich at a good price, I'd check out the other stuff they have to offer from their menu."

They pride themselves on being part of the community. And not just serving City College which has been the case in the past with other places. Where else can you go and they know your name and things about you, always have a smile even when it's crazy. Susan goes out of here way to make you feel comfortable and well taken care of! Also, the Turkey Avocado is the truth. Great coffee and their cookies (especially peanut butter) and pastries are all on point, including their chocolate mousse cheese cake! I wish they would take over the restaurant next door so they could expand and have more seating.  This is one of my all time favorite places in the hood and I strongly recommend you hit it up."

And you won't find a better price for La Colombe coffee in town. For lunch, I've been constantly delighted by their sandwiches and wraps. Big ups for the California wrap (pesto and chicken: can't go wrong there) and the spicy beef sandwich was like a combo of a bahn mi and pastrami sandwich with the fresh cilantro and their special sauce. All of their special sandwiches are just that: special! I would instantly gain 10 lbs if I lived closer because I'd eat all the pastries and all the sandwiches all the days. It's a humble spot that's easy to miss but wow what a great find this was!"

Very accommodating... every place has bad days but so far we have been extremely happy with our deliveries. I do wish they had the croissant donuts on the delivery service menu's and whole wheat croissants. The same for what sugar free options they have for their coffee's.

I got very sick from their salmon, found an actual pebble in my crab cake, noticed that all of their shrimp is uncleaned, and had a pasta salad with dirt it in from the unwashed vegetables they used. It's really unacceptable. I can't go to a place where I have to worry about either chipping a tooth or throwing up. Also, every single one of their roasted vegetable dishes is just drenched in olive oil, but they still charge $10 for a small container? No thanks."

The slices weren't super thick but it was definitely laden with cheese and the other toppings I had asked for (AND THEY DID IT CORRECTLY THANK YOU T_T - because my family likes plain but i like pepperoni and mushroom so they did half and half with the pie. sometimes, other pizza places do half pepperoni on one side and mushroom on the other and it's just.....sad beucase my family won't eat it ): ). Taste wise, it was great and I definitely would recommend this place. Maybe it'll be my go-to pizza place when I want pizza near home and am unwilling to go to Costco for cheaper slices."

I could eat at di fara's for that But they have you by the balls because theres nothing there except 5 guys or Wendy's A real rip off.

I walked out without waiting for more side dish as it was very insulting. They need to stop playing garmentos old style and start to show little respect .

Didn't actually order the dishes myself so I'mma try my best to describe them w/o their formal names. Also v lit that they have non-dairy accommodations. Here's my take on Raj's takeout:Yellow cauliflower curry: best dish fo sho. Thick chunks of cauliflower soak up a flavorful curry, tamed down w a side of brown rise. Y'all I could go for some of that right now.Red chickpea dish (channa masala?): mad oily bro, she was flavorful but she also slicked up my insides real goodChicken biryani type dish: some average-tasting mixed rice w chicken chunks that could have been just a tad more tenderThis would be good drunk food.

The food here is amazing and I have always ordered delivery (I have never actually been in person) and it's always super fast and easy and reliable. I usually order off delivery apps like grubhub and DoorDash. The butter chicken is the best thing I've gotten here. The naan as well is large and buttery. The pricing is great for NYC and pretty much matches prices I've seen in the Midwest and other typically cheaper places. I love this place and I highly recommend if you are looking for authentic Indian food.

We ordered 3 chicken dishes, the Briyani, Butter and Chili. The chicken in each of the entrees was brick dry. I cook often and think it's quite the feat of negligence or extreme cost saving to continue to boil old protein that wasn't immediately served, for this extended period of time. Either way the customers are the ones that have to pay.Food came on time from Uber eats, actually early so that's not it. Avoid this place it's yet another astroturfed restaurant where they would rather spend their money to dupe you rather than serve quality food that they could be proud of."

We order at least once a week from Raj, the food has always been good but there have been a couple of times when the flavor was off OR the naan was burnt! Delivery is getting ridiculous, we have tried ordering from Seamless and Doordash which results in the food being delivered 15-20 mins after it's estimated time. The manager claims that DoorDash doesn't have enough drivers but this is a recurring issue!!! Don't take orders if you can't deliver!!!! Late delivery means cold curry and soggy naan, who wants to pay for that???"

Â They really should offer regular tap water as does any other restaurant in NYC! Â Now onto the food which was amazing-we did the Omakase which isn't cheap but was worth every penny. Â Each piece of fish delivered to us as picked out by the sushi chef was superb and we could not get enough of it. Â We had multiple types of tuna, mackerel, yellow tail, white fish, squid, salmon and a serving of two types of roe wrapped in seaweed. Â We enjoyed the delicious Sake we ordered as well and at the end of the meal we each got a fatty tuna hand roll to end the evening that was part of the experience. Â They explained each course and what type of fish we would be eating and it was laid out in an amazing fashion on the plate.We had a large group so we also split some appetizers which were very tasty-including the Shumai which was fantastic and a refreshing and light peashoot salad as well as the fried Japanese chicken, gyoza and edamame. Â Overall it was a fantastic experience and I want to go back to try more of their fish as everything tasted super fresh and delicious!"

Yum. $14Open style Omakase:12 pieces of sushi, no appetizers, no dessert, no soup, for $109.Some pieces were great (including the Saba, Hamachi belly, Toro, Chu-toro), but some were over-seared, and/or over-marinated, to the point they were extremely sweet or spicy.The rice itself was good.For $109, this Omakase doesn't justify its cost.-- SERVICE --For its cost, the service could have been better.The waiter, while knowledgable about the food, wasn't able to explain in a clear manner the difference between the different options in the menu. Additionally, the restaurant does not serve free tap water. Which is a no-no in my book.-- OVERALL --We enjoyed eating proper sushi after so long, and I think the sushi here is good. Unfortunately, it's also over-priced, and not a very good value for money."

I got there at 3:30pm on Saturday thinking it was gonna be packed but they didn't even let people in until 4pm. There were about 4 other parties waiting with me. They only had bottled water which I thought was odd but it was complimentary. Hot tea was also complimentary. I ordered a sushi omakase. The best one was the fatty tuna. All of them had a bit of soy sauce and wasabi on them already. I was only given a side of ginger. All the others were fine. Uni was mediocre. I also ordered salmon sashimi to test out their fish by itself. It was mediocre and not as fresh as Tomoe's was.

Even the customers next to us they were laughing at us.Why you doing this to us??Even the sushi already had the soy sauce on itBut it is what we want even we have to pay we will pay!The food was so good and the service was great.But the only thing make me and my friend won't never come back because of her. She was really rude and upset us a lots she ruin our happy mood to eat and to enjoy the food. We just ate quickly and want to leave that's place as soon we can.

I like my nori crisp, not soggy, so this worked out great for us!My yellow tail belly and salmon belly nigiri sushi were sublime! Absolutely fresh and delicious!My spicy salmon hand-roll was fabulous! I have never received an unassembled Hand-roll where you wrap it fresh yourself. I enjoyed the experience of the crispiest nori with my rolling it easily with the yummy spicy salmon filling! This in itself, to me, deserves 5 stars! I also had edamame, we ordered cucumber roll, yellow tail scallion roll, and spicy tuna roll!Let me tell you, if you want the freshest sushi, this is the absolute best in New York!

We had reservations for Valentine's Day at 8:45 and weren't seated until 10 pm. It's understandable considering the situation but it was very annoying. They did treat us to a bottle of Prosecco to make up for it. And the service was really great and friendly throughout the rest of the Â night. Anyway the food more than made up for the wait. We ordered the Valentine's special omakase for 2. Each of us received an appetizer of tempura, 12 pieces of nigiri, soup, salad, a hand roll and a dessert. I wish I remembered the fish that we got but I can just say everything they prepared was exquisite. The salad was a hit. The miso soup was very different that what I'm used to from the American version-- a lot silkier and a softer seaweed and scallion mix. From what I remember of the sushi, the best pieces were the mackerel, the medium fatty tuna, and a surprising barracuda. The dessert was also really great. My boyfriend got a mango type of cake and I received a matcha (we didn't choose it but it was perfect because we both enjoyed the ones selected for us). The side of mochi was also really excellent. As much as the reservation situation was very annoying to us and a few other couples who endured the wait with us. We all left with a smile on our face and a stomach full of some of the best sushi I've ever had! I'd recommend (and will be back) on a regular night that hopefully won't be as crazy as last night. Thanks again for a wonderful meal!"

We all ordered the sushi and sashimi omakase which took a while to be served. We were pretty hungry by the time the sashimi arrived. I enjoyed the oyster. The toro was not as melt-in-your-mouth as I was expecting. The rest of the omakase was, however, well-paced. The Santa Barbara uni was so sweet! I wish I could have gotten more. The rest of the sushi pieces did not really stand out to me.4 stars for the service and the availability of omakase in Brooklyn is great. 3 stars for the actual food because nothing really stood out to me and for the price. Sushi Katsuei's omakase is pricier than most places in Manhattan."

I did not like the fact that I ordered a whole pound of meat and I didn't have enough toppings. They only gave me enough toppings for a one burger.

1144,xTnivXEdEtXrnhp-z4JGvg,12/4/2020,1 star rating,"I really, really wanted to like this place. I had heard good things about it. I looked at the menu for take-out as I was at home and craving a juicy cheeseburger oozing with cheese and perfectly caramelized onions. I guess I was extremely hungry as I was looking at the menu because I ordered food that totaled over $55 via ubereats. What a disappointment and a waste of money.The food did arrive on time in the expected window timeframe. But the food was not very good. I ordered the regular cheeseburger I forget what the actual name was but I ordered it with grilled onions and American cheese and medium well. I also got a cheesesteak for my daughter and an order of friend Portobello mushroom strips as well as the half and half which is half order of onion rings and half of fries.Burger- 0ver $12- not good- the meat was cooked to a medium well if you looked at it the color was pinkish, but the texture of the meat was very dry and not juicy at all. The ratio of onions to burger did not match at all. There was a ton of onions on the burger with some of the onion being the outer part of the onion that should be discarded and not cooked. Cheese was non existent. Half & Half- small order was $6 ( only if you order on uber eats- door dash does not offer the different portion options) they weren't good anyway. The onion rings, while they were crisp they were saturated in oil and they were so salty. Onions have a natural sweetness to them normally so for you not to taste Â that natural sweetness they had to be salty . The fries were oily and limp as well.Portobello Mushroom strips- $8- the portion was a good size but they must use the same batter that is used for the onion rings because those too were extremely salty. I usually am very tolerant of salt but this was just very off putting. I'm not sure if it was just the saltiness or if they also use some type of oil that tastes awful.I can't comment on the cheesesteak because I did not try it, but Â I do know that it is now 5 days later and half of that cheesesteak is still sitting in my refrigerator, which leads me to believe that my daughter didn't like it but is afraid to throw it away because of how much we spent.I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about here when they said the price is reasonable because $12 for a burger without a side of fries is not reasonable. Â Another reviewer stated that this place is similar to shake shack. That is also not true. Shake shack burgers are much more thinner and the meat isn't dry and tough as in this case. They are also less expensive.I will not give this place another try and I should have requested a refund. But I am trying to be understanding of businesses needing the business, But gosh, they really have to do better."

1149,xTnivXEdEtXrnhp-z4JGvg,9/8/2019,5 star rating,"Sometimes you just want a decently pried and great burger, some fries and/or onion rings, and a soda. This place delivers. The classic American, one with a fried egg, the Blue Hawaiian one I got last night that finally made me sit down and write this review, which had a giant pineapple slice on it with blue cheese crumbles on it and was borderline ""sloppy Joe"" dripping... but oh was it worth it. They have Impossible Burgers now if you don't or can't eat meat for ethical / dietary / etc. reasons.The onion ring / fries combo platter, the large they bring to you in a giant carbs mound; get the small unless you're in a large group or carb loading for your gym or something. They've got other stuff I've never tried before, like tater tots with cheese, chicken wings, etc. I've had a shake of theirs once and Â all but did the ""Scooby Doo floating up"" thing... but I had to spend a lot of time in the gym the next day. They have free refills on soda, which gets big points from me. Charging for refills for sugar water coming out of a tap is ""1 month finders fee for apartments"" level of NYC obnoxiousness to me.Guys with handlebar mustaches serving you gluten-free water, and women with large enough scarves to knit quilts out of it, ordering $20 bowls of ramen, long waits, well, that gets old after a while. Speaking of long waits, this is well away from the crowds of Austin St. so that's never been an issue here. If you get the large ""carbs mound"" fries/onion rings for your group... you'll want to burn off some calories.Those who read my reviews know that I go look for local haunts that look like they were dropped right out of Indonesia / China / Ethiopia / the deep US South into NYC, nestled away in holes in walls that are cheap, don't have trendy music, don't have marble tables, and the food is priced accordingly. This place's decor is... this faux 1950s vibe, with that kind of music, pink walls, cheesy posters everywhere, etc. I don't mind it but I can see it bugging some people.So yeah, you want a rare-cooked burger (that's how I do it) with no pretentiousness? Come here."

Food was really good and tasted fresh. All portion sizes were big and was worth the value. Really loved the onion rings and they were freshly cut vs the frozen kind.

Â I find it to be an above average burger and when you add in the toppings it really is a top quality burger.You have a few options for size. Â I normally get the semi serious which is a 1/3 lb.

Â One other thing they do really well is they make cherry cokes by adding cherry syrup.

My favorite side to get it with is the ooey gooey mac and cheese which is out of this world. The BBQ sauce is so good I get extra BBQ sauce on the side. The chicken is soft and tender and the french fries are also really good.Come here for some really good BBQ chicken and mac n cheese!!! They also serve sorrel. I haven't tried it but its very hard to find a place that makes sorrel fresh! They also oddly have a very large selection of ginger cola, beers ranging from Stella to Guinness.

1167,OS27j6CbRx7Cq6Fg8mS-KA,2/25/2020,1 star rating,"FRAUDULENT restaurant: be mindful of your tip overcharge.THIS RESTAURANT OVERCHARGED MY TIP. My friend and I went there last week. We split but she wanted to be the one to pay the tip so I only gave like less than 10% tip (I could have done no tip, but felt bad since I still had my card charged and a receipt to fill in). Now, I got charged with at least 25% tip which means that the restaurant not only refilled the number I put on my bill (ILLEGAL CONDUCT) But also charged both of us 50% TIPS combined. AND IT WAS NOT WORTH THE SERVICE. I would honestly call the police but since it's like just $4 more I would rather not waste my time on it. Still, $1 more or $4 more, a FRAUDULENT ACT IS A FRAUDULENT ACT. IT IS ILLEGAL AND UNETHICAL. I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN, YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE."

Decor was pretty good and the place was quite crowded even though we were. Bit past the lunchtime rush. Mix of people having drinks at the bar and those eating at the tables. I was not hungry so I just had a Guinness. It was good. The 7 year old went for the penne alla vodka of which I had a bite. Bland. The ten year old had pasta with shrimp and white wine garlic sauce. I didn't sample his dish. Kids didn't complain or say much either way. Service was zero stars. Never cleared our dishes and after 45 minutes of waiting with two bored kids I went up to the bar and asked for the check. I'd come back but for drinks only and not the food.

I get home with my food, put my son to bed and finally sit down for a late dinner. I cut into my steak there's nothing but fat. I cut again, same thing so I keep carving. I'm carving off pure fat... still carving! 7oz of fat total! I get that steaks have fat but this is just ridiculous and sheer laziness on the kitchens part to ever serve something like this. Â I wonder who in the kitchen at Outback wants to eat the 7oz of fat they clearly didn't think twice about serving me"
1175,OS27j6CbRx7Cq6Fg8mS-KA,2/19/2020,2 star rating,"Based on the amount of pictures I've uploaded for this restaurant, you can tell I've been here many times; more than I'd like to admit to. I tend to order the same meal 90% of the time (Pork Porterhouse with Mac & Cheese and Cheesy Broccoli. Whenever I've tried to venture out to other items (i.e.-burgers, blooming onions, steak), I've ever left disappointed or with very high blood pressure. The blooming onion they sell is massive and it has almost an entire day's worth of calories and sodium in that ""appetizer"". They shouldn't allow you to order that unless you're with a group of 8.The drinks are incredibly weak. Like super weak. Like...I'd drink their cocktails to sober up if I was out all night. The ""cocoktail"" I've ordered the most is the Aussie Rum Punch. And over the years they could never get it right and it took a while to figure out why. It is ALLEGEDLY a $5 cocktail that features 2 name brand rums and a variety of ""fresh"" fruit juice. What could go wrong right? This should be the best deal in New York...wrong! They don't use a single fresh juice; maaaaaybe they can make the claim that the lime juice was fresh at some point, but the other ingredients were clearly pre-made sugar syrups. And they 100% did not use the rums listed in the recipe. They opted for barely FDA legal well bottles of rum. They also topped it off with soda water. I used to pay extra money for another shot to increase the strength and they'd regularly bring me vodka and completely ruin the drink. And this may not be their fault, but I always have an issue with their dining rewards app. All these visits and I still have 0 recorded. All in all, this place has it's utility, but it's still a chain restaurant so you shouldn't expect much...not even what's on the menu."

Always give out old food and when you request it to be fresh they act like they have to go in the back kill the cow and chicken and then cook it. Sanchez the manager I delt with tonight didn't listen to my order and rushed everything and got it wrong I asked for fresh food and it was like the hardest thing in the world I got so upset with his manner I demanded my money back on a lil $6 order but just the lack of respect I wasn't having it..I do food service to for the past 7 years and would never serve something to some one that I wouldn't eat. These ppl need to humble them selves and get another job if they are so miserable

Also the girl cashier there is so funny and nice, sometimes they dont Â even ask for my order and they have it making as soon as they see me and my friends This is the only Burger King Â or fast food place that i have seen give us this much attention.

He blamed it on the pandemic, I get it supplies and help are scarce currently but it doesn't take much to print up a menu every week with options you can actually offer. Food was just ok, nothing special. After dinner we received the check...buyer beware....the prices on the check don't match the prices on the menu, several items had prices inflated.

In my case, I had ordered tagliatelle with white truffle but the last available one didn't meet the chef's expectations. So, they proposed black truffle instead. They generously grated it on my pasta and the result was a delicious dish. Creamy and earthy. Definitely one of the best Italian restaurants in the city!"

I appreciated the air conditioning because it was a hot day. A great lunch spot! I ordered the Combo 3 which was the 3 birria tacos with consomme. That was $11.95. Â I added cheese so that was an extra $3. It took about 10-15 minutes for my order to be ready. It was definitely worth it. The tacos were very filling. They did not skimp on the meat. The tacos were very crunchy. The consomme was very flavorful. They gave three condiments.

We had really high hopes, but it didn't even meet our expectations. We decided to do delivery around 4:30PM. To start off, the food did not come in 40min (as stated in the app). I called the restaurant to see If something happened. Instead I was dismissed by whoever picked up, with ""there's only one driver. The food will come warm."" No apology or recognition on their part they're not delivering on time. Okay no problem. Food comes in 1hr 15min. FYI, we weren't even that far from the restaurant (10min walk). Delivery driver called giving us attitude saying we weren't outside, turns out he was on the wrong street.Let's go on to the food. To start off, it wasn't even warm anymore. By the time we opened it, the food was almost at room temp. Veggie nachos- not sure if they made a mistake on the order, but for some reason it was basically a nacho cake. 4 tortas that had the nacho topping in between and just cut into 4 pieces. You would think it was would be packaged properly with topping in one and a bag of chips in the other? Let's not forget! They were soggy. On the bright side the tostadas were still crunchy and soggy in the middle. We ordered al pastor combo 2, and spicy pork combo 2. We ended up getting 2 spicy porks combos OR there's no distinct difference in the two. Who knows. Also, quesadilla from there isn't the typically quesadilla you might be thinking about. Looks more like a giant taco with melted cheese. Also got 2 fish tacos, didn't think it was seasoned well. More like 1/2 a tilapia per taco and some pico de Gallo and a wedge of avocado on top with some cheese. Also got a shrimp combo, it's mini shrimp, don't expect medium shrimp. Lacked a bit of flavor there. There's more to it, but let's just say this for now- I would go to the Queens location over this one any day. The service I received wasn't great. I wouldn't do delivery again- especially since we paid a tip I didn't think the service deserved ahead of time. Maybe in person pick up will yield better results. Might give it another chance in the near future, but it wouldn't be my go to taqueria in Brooklyn."

Â Nicely seasoned and quite different from other tacos I have had in Sunset Park or anywhere else in Brooklyn. Â Will definitely return to try their other offerings.

1251,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,4/2/2021,4 star rating,"I ordered takeout because I was craving authentic Mexican food one day, and decided to try this new spot that opened in my neighborhood.Let me tell you, the horchata was well worth the money. Whenever I order horchata, it comes in some tiny little cup that I finish in three minutes, but this one? This came in a soup quart container and I drank happily at it for a whole hour and more. Granted, I ordered the large for $5.50, but I did not regret it at all. The cinnamon and the rice notes of the drink are distinctive, and I thoroughly enjoyed my drink, even though I've had more flavorful horchata elsewhere.I loved the chorizo and al pastor tacos I got, and they have have been some of the best tacos I've ever eaten. They're stuffed full of meat, and it was falling out of my hands as I ate. They come with two sauces, a lime wedge, and some digusting radishes that I ate anyway because I dislike wasting food. All in all, it was very satisfying, and I'm sure that three tacos is enough for a meal.I also ordered the spicy pork nachos, which I split into two separate meals, because the portion was so big. There's a lot of meat and cheese, but not too many nachos, which is fine with me. It means more bang for my buck if I get more protein out of my meal, and every bit of it was delicious.Lastly, I also ordered the famous birria tacos. I've never had them before, so I don't know what to expect. The beef flavor is potent, and extremely so. I think this is a good thing, but I don't like beef very much, so I won't be ordering it again. It was worth experiencing it once though. I've never dunked tacos in a jus-type sauce before, and it was as messy as you can expect. Definitely not for everyone, certainly not for me, but I can see why people like it.I am sure I'll be ordering from here again very soon."

My friends and I arrived in the afternoon and there was a long line of people. Looks like party of 1's are quite popular here and they get seated quick at the bar. While on the line, there was a cute Buvette bike parked at one of the poles. My friends and I shared the following dishes: Chocolate Croissants, Saumon Fume, Jambon Cru, and CRQ Forestier. The Chocolate Croissants were really good! I love how flaky it is on the outside and the dark chocolate on the inside. We originally wanted the Almond Croissant but it was sold out, get here early to get it! Saumon Fume was also really good. I love how fluffy the scrambled eggs and the smoked salmon was just the perfect pairing! I would totally get it again! The popular Jambon Cru also had fluffy eggs and the prosciutto was good. I did think the dish was lacking, perhaps, it needs more flavor or seasoning. CRQ Forestier was heavy! It had intense aroma and flavors of mushroom and gruyere cheese and tomatoes. This dish was good but was a bit too heavy for my taste. Portions look like they are for one person, not too big.I enjoyed my brunch experience here and would come back for the croissants and the Saumon Fume!"

The service is nothing special. It's really slow but the people are nice.Cappuccino: 5/10Weak coffee. The foam was thin, not very frothy. Not worth the price at all.Chocolate Croissant: 3/10You're a French restaurant and you call it a ""chocolate croissant""... that should have been my first indication. These tasted like they were bought at a grocery store. They were small and big fluffy or flakey at all. They were dense. Not what I wanted at all. Betteraves (beets): 9/10I love beets - call me crazy. These were cooked perfectly! They were too hard or soft and the shallot and horseradish crÃ¨me was delicious on top! Quite a simple dish and small but the crÃ¨me was special.Saumon FumÃ© (steamed eggs with smoked salmon and crÃ¨me fraiche): 10/10This is why we come folks. The eggs do not have anything in them but a little bit of salt and pepper and are prepared in a Â way that makes them extremely fluffy. They just fill your mouth with happiness. The smoked salmon, toasted bread with olive oil, and crÃ¨me fraiche were all such a perfect combination.Tuna Salad: 8/10A very interesting combination of items but together it was very refreshing. I think the green beans could have been cut up so everything was cut up and bite sized. The tuna salad tasted very fresh. I enjoyed it.Overall definitely worth going to for a more than casual meal. Don't expect incredible service but do expect good food. And please get the eggs!"

However the food and service this time were quite disappointing. We waited for more than 30mins for our food, and the server kept walking pass our table but had never checked on us for our order. By the time we got our food, they were almost cold. The server suddenly decided to check us after we got our food and kept asking if we were done with our food while obviously we had not. Very rude service and average food."

We waited ~30-40 mins in line and were finally seated in the corner of the restaurant. The table was extremely cramped - we were right next to the table to our right and barely had space for our small purses and jackets. I ordered the croque monseur sandwich and my friends both got eggs. The food was pretty good - but don't think it's worth the hype/wait. Probably won't be returning - only because there's tons of other brunch places without the crazy wait.

On the off chance that I was in the city on a weekday, I was able to try the brunch here.There is a longer wait for outdoor seating, about 20 minutes, but I was able to be seated inside within 5 minutes of waiting on the line. There is a reason why the outdoor seating is preferred: the tables inside are REALLY tiny and packed tightly. The table for two honestly is comfortable for a single person, and the table for 4 is more of a table for 2. I had to watch my drink when people were moving in and out between tables or it would be knocked over quite easily. On the other hand, the tables outside are slightly bigger and more spaced out.As for food, the brunch options are fabulous and quintessentially French. I highly recommend the steamed eggs, that was actually what drew me here to begin with (curse you Instagram!). Apparently they are made using the steamer from the espresso machine. I tried the eggs with prosciutto and it was delicious, albeit the portions are smaller than expected. It is served over 2 thin slices of bread and topped with 2 slices of prosciutto and shaved parmesan. The plate it is served on is an appetizer plate, not a dinner plate, just to give you an idea of size.I also got a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice (you can literally hear the juicer running in the background, which makes it quite noisy indoors) and while it was expensive, but sweet and full of pulp. I liked how it came in this cute little pitcher and a glass that is barely bigger than a shot glass.Overall, I am glad I got to try the steamed eggs and had a pleasant experience. Next time I would like to try the croquet madame (and perhaps, wait a bit longer for the outdoor seating if the weather is still nice)."

The line was pretty long as we waited outside, but it moves relatively quickly. They originally told us it would be about 25 to 30 minute wait, but because we were willing to sit outside in the covered area, we only waited about 10 minutes. The outdoor seating area was covered with heaters, so it made it quite enjoyable. The service was a little slow, but then again they were quite busy. Unfortunately, they did run out of almond croissants, which were a bummer, but the chocolate croissants were really tasty. I highly recommend the brunch but just know that it's not huge portions and they charge about six dollars for a coffee. Other than that I really enjoyed it and I look forward to coming back again."

We ordered the croque madame, Belgian waffle, and salmon + egg to share between 3 people. Prices were about $18 each dish. The food looked great, but there was a very small amount given the price point. The waffle and salmon + egg weren't anything special, but the flavors of the croque madame were great and the best part of the meal. The drinks were also very good.

There's a nice back yard, cheap beer options, and on Fridays they have really good DJs. Also, this is one of the only places in town you can get Tim's Cascade kettle chips. You might be thinking ""What is the big deal about a bag of potato chips?"" That's pretty much what I said to my Seattleite roomie who was freaking out when she realized Milo's sold them. She bought us a bag of JalapeÃ±o and bag of Cheddar & Sour Cream and as something of a potato chip connoisseur I was blown away by their crispness and the flavor - particularly the jalapeÃ±o, which gives other spicy chips a run for their money.ANYWAY THOUGH, this isn't a review of chips, it's a review of Milo's.

No flavor! Anyway not coming back. Blah. I love beef jerky but not a fan of flavorless jerky. Maybe others liked it because of the soft texture but I'm from Cali and we love jerky with crazy flavor!

They had some of the most interesting and unusual tasting Jerkys that I've ever had. A little sweet Asian flavor mixed with the meat.I'm not totally obsessed with them, but with a cheap prices and how unique they are - and how delicious most people would find them, especially if you like sweet Asian meat - no pun intended - not trying to be dirty - then I will definitely give them five stars.I can now definitely said I've had sweet Asian meat and I've liked it."
1275,RH6kTt81G4OdWP603LnoDQ,9/26/2018,5 star rating,"This is the best jerky I've had.I don't really know how they make the jerky here soooo tender to the point where it basically melts in your mouth but whatever they do it's really a texture that I've not had in other jerkies. Â You definitely don't run your jaw sore from eating a pound of this jerky. Â In fact, your like, dammit I wish I bought 8 pounds of the stuff for one sitting.It doesn't matter which protein you choose, they are all fantastic. Â The curry versions for each protein add a flavor profile that is mildly spicy without overtaking the underlying flavor of the meat. Â I wish there was a way for me to preserve the jerky for more than a couple of days at a time without having to trek into lower manhattan for my jerky fix. Â The only thing I can say against Ling Kee is that the prices are really more than I've paid for jerky elsewhere. Â Make sure you hit the ATM before visiting because when the final tally comes and your hit with a bill for 30-40 bucks, and don't have the cash,.. Â  that's gonna suck. Â I also kinda wish they also had either later hours or earlier hours but since they only sell jerky I think it would be hard to ask for longer hours without inflating the price more."

The jerky had a pleasant texture more juicy and tender than convenience store packaged jerky. The jerky was sweet and savoury. It was 3mm in thickness. For a snack, this is a nice quick treat."

It's sold in flat sheets, slightly warm, and tastes like a trip to Asia. My favorites are the chicken curry and the shrimp, but all are good. Eat them on the spot or wrap and freeze them. Rewarmed, they're great broken into small pieces and sprinkled in salads or veg-and-grain bowls."
1280,RH6kTt81G4OdWP603LnoDQ,11/22/2020,5 star rating,"The Jerky was definitely different from what I was used to! I'm always looking to try new foods and Ling Kee's Jerky did not disappoint! I was unsure what to order, and the Store Lady was kind enough to guide me through the process and recommendations! I bought a quarter pound of spicy pork and spicy beef. Both very delicious in their own rights. I will definitely visit again when I'm in the area!"
1281,RH6kTt81G4OdWP603LnoDQ,1/30/2017,5 star rating,"The best beef and pork jerky I've ever had is from here. This little hole in the wall is seriously jerky heaven. Their fresh jerky are tender, moist and flavorful, it will literally melt in your mouth. Unlike the packaged jerky, theirs aren't chewy nor dry. They also offer many different flavors and meats to choose from like pork, beef, chicken and shrimp. Although the prices are quite high compared to American/Chinese packaged jerky or should I say, there is no comparison, this is fresh stuff so you get what you pay for. Every time I come here, I always end up getting at least a pound or two of jerky for myself or a couple of pounds for gifting, which they vacuum seal the jerky for you so it stays fresh. Â The staff are super nice and accommodating even when you ask for a specific dollar amount of jerky instead of their traditional quarter, half or 1 pound increments. A pound for $20/$21 gets you a good 9-10 slices and I highly recommend the spicy pork or beef jerky, chopped if you prefer it more tender, otherwise stick with the regular."
1282,RH6kTt81G4OdWP603LnoDQ,6/16/2019,4 star rating,"The jerky is as tender and flavorful as it gets. If you are used to packaged american jerky like Slim Jims, you're in for a real treat! The shop is really efficient - you pay the cash and you'll be out the door with delicious jerkies within a minute.Tried the pork and the beef jerky. The beef was a bit tougher and drier. The seasoning had a nice umami taste which was not too salty and not at all sweet. Almost no fat content, pretty much 100% lean meat. But don't get me wrong - it's a lot more tender than American jerkies still.The pork was sweeter and much softer. It almost crumbles to the touch. This was a lot fattier than the beef, and a lot sweeter too. The sauce was more sweet than savory and overall the pork jerky was a nice contrast to the beef.Only complaint is the price ($20+/lb). The jerkies, while good, are pretty expensive. Certainly more expensive than other places, but decent value for what you pay."
1283,IFQ1CXX3QTiuOjeXYvtWLw,9/19/2021,5 star rating,"My favorite poke spot in Brooklyn! Quality for the price is unmatched when it comes to poke in Brooklyn, and delivery is solid. I've tried their sushi rolls before too which are also fresh and tasty. Every ingredient in my bowl tastes fresh which is great. I alternate between the 2 scoop and 3 scoop bowls - portion is on the larger side which I appreciate! It's a pretty small space so wouldn't necessarily recommend for dine-in. Customer service was good the couple times I've gone in person for takeout. Overall would recommend, especially compared to other poke spots within the area."
1284,IFQ1CXX3QTiuOjeXYvtWLw,11/21/2019,5 star rating,"If you poke, you should Poke City. I'm done with trying others as Poke City has the most consistent, highest quality fish and the best prepared poke bowls you can get in the greater downtown Brooklyn area. Sure, the delivery ""fee of $2"" is annoying considering 97% of other app ordering are free coupled with the fact that they close early (last order by 8:30pm) means you better plan early. I will say they are expedient with delivery (though have forgotten to look at the apartment number and lazily called instead). What doesn't disappoint is their bowls or their standard fare sushi (says my wife). They have the right sized pieces of fish and toppings along with the right balance of rice (and an option to mix brown and white!). Their sauces are flavorful and the herbs (toppings like cilantro) are fresh and abundant. Double bonus that they use fully compostable containers (at least for their poke bowls). This should be on your short list the next time you're in the mood for a bowl of Poke."
1285,IFQ1CXX3QTiuOjeXYvtWLw,9/28/2020,5 star rating,The Salmon Lover Bowl is my favorite! The mango is a surprisingly perfect sweetness to the touch of spice and other flavors.Really - this is just a bowl of happiness.

This place is it, I wish it was closer to me! The serving size is great, everything tasted fresh and there's a good variety of ingredients. Take out only!"
1287,IFQ1CXX3QTiuOjeXYvtWLw,9/18/2018,3 star rating,"In terms of poke quality, this place is rather unremarkable. But in terms of what they offer and their prices, it can't be beat.Note that their ordering system needs some clarification - the signs say choose your base first, but you have to choose how many proteins you want beforehand because that determines the size of the bowl they use.What's nice is you can split your base 50/50, and they don't charge extra like some other places. I did half brown rice with quinoa, and half organic spring mix.For my proteins, I did two (for $10.99. Three is $12.99). I went with sous vide chicken breast and yellowtail. They were both about the same color, so that was fun. Chicken was fine, a little bit too smooth. Yellowtail wasn't objectionable in any way, but also wasn't particularly fresh. Don't expect the catch of the day, I guess.They do offer a ton of protein options, including tuna, shrimp, salmon, and vegetarian options. So that's nice.For toppings, you get 4 included - I went with avocado (duh), edamame, shiitake mushroom, and seaweed salad. All pretty fine choices, though looking at the full menu now, I could've maximized on some more exotic stuff.Lastly, you choose a sauce and any crunchy toppings. I did the toasted sesame dressing (they put in a lot, so be sure to let them know ""when""), as well as sesame seeds and onion crisps.All that for $11 + tax. Wow.The bowl for 2 proteins isn't huge or anything. It's about the diameter of a standard plastic salad bowl, but not as tall. Still, it should be the right amount of food for one serving for the average person. If you're not average... then I guess go for 3 proteins.Probably won't return, but it's nice to have as an option."
1288,IFQ1CXX3QTiuOjeXYvtWLw,2/15/2021,5 star rating,Their bowls are GENEROUS. Always filled to the brim and the best part is the avocado is no extra charge!! The ratio of all the ingredients are perfectly balanced and leaves you satisfied. Would order from here all the time if I lived nearby.

Maybe the fish was ok.. but maybe not so much the other ingredients or the sauces. Nothing tasted off, but obviously something was. We didn't have the same toppings. The only common ingredients in our bowls were the tuna, salmon, and rice. I had a tummy upset. He had the full on runs. Definitely not going back. A first and last time for us."

But the last few times I've gone they always give such a small portion of ahi tuna and a tonnnn of the crabmeat salad (see photo for reference).

I ordered their falafel and OMGGG it is seriously sooooo good. Hands down the best falafel I have ever had in my entire life. I dream about eating this falafel all the time. It is just out of the way for me to go there often. It is better than Taim in soho and Mamoun's for sure. I highly recommend this place!

Very affordable and super delicious food. I've also had the soup, it rotates daily but every soup I've had I've enjoyed. I also love the servers, it's usually a one woman show and they really work the room. Don't sleep on Newtown."

The lady in the front is always smiling, and always pleasant, which is a bonus in my book, it shows that working in the restaurant is something she loves, and if the workers feel the same way, it's reflected in the food, which is good quality. My only qualm is that certain dishes(for me the wontons, egg rolls and sesame chicken), I have a greasy and sick feeling after eating it, which may just be a personal problem, but I would be interested to see other peoples opinions on those dishes. Overall though, great place to go, considering they're only one block away from my home."

Whatever your feelings about law enforcement, never let it be said that they don't know what's up when it comes to cheap food.I have to say, this is some of the better cheap Americanised Chinese food I've had, and certainly the best in the neighborhood. Their sauces aren't too ketchupy or salty, their shrimp and scallion dishes are well-done, their vegetables are pretty damn fresh and not too scanty, and they really know how to fry tofu. They also have some of the tastiest fried vegetarian dumplings around; I think they cook them with dumpling sauce, instead of just thawing and frying them, and it really makes a difference.There's also a dining area, with plenty of chairs and tables which are generally pretty clean, and lots of light and air."

I took Mandarin for 3 years, this guy is really racist for thinking that a black girl doesnt know chinese and thinking that I wouldnt understand him, they need to fire this guy because he's bad for business. It's rude to ask for a tip, and then to curse out the customer TO THEIR FACE just gives me more of a reason not to give you a tip. He wears a orangish red hoodie, so please people, instead of giving him a tip, ask for your change back, because he didnt even give me my change back and was still asking for a tip. greedy no good bastard, this guy is getting ballsy now and has absoutely no respect for customers. Annie 88 Express, here's a tip for you; get rid of this asshole and you'll be able to get some actual repeat business.

Was in the mood for sushi and there aren't many options close by my bf's apartment in Bedstuy, borderline to Bushwick. When I attempted to order from seamless, it told me that the restaurant did not delivery to his address, but lucky I called to double check and they did. The lady on the phone was sweet but there was a language barrier and it became a little difficult to order. On the phone, she assured me that it wasn't busy so delivery would only take about 35-40 minutes. Delivery took exactly an hour. Now to the food. We ordered California rolls, a few orders of the shrimp tempura rolls, the spring rolls, and the buffalo wings. Spring rolls were just what you would expect from spring rolls. They were small but came with two, which was nice. I was Bey disappointed in the buffalo wings. I expected some spicy, saucy deliciousness and instead I got subpar fried wings and buffalo sauce on the side. Who orders buffalo wings just to get regular chicken and have to dip the wings into the sauce?! Shrimp tempura rolls were good but I've definitely had better. I didn't try the California rolls but my boyfriend devoured them so I'm guessing they were good. Would I order from here again? Yea, if desperate for sushi when I'm in the area. But is it my preference? No, and I'd probably try Akura next time, which is the other sushi spot close in vicinity."

You can get rolls with soup or salad or a big bowl of soup and walk away full with a full wallet too. Lunch specials are cash only. They have a large variety of vegetarian sushi so I spent a lot of time here while pregnant! Sake, beer, wine are great and affordable too (not while pregnant)."

This is a perfect spot for an intimate date, it's quiet (minus the Black Sabbath blasting, it seemed to blend in so nicely that the place still gave off a vibe of being quiet), and has a nice simple ambiance. The exposed brick walls are painted white, there's a small bar, a few tables and then benches surrounding the perimeter for extra seating. It's also a great alternative from Daddy's...I live in the neighborhood and sometimes I just really don't feel like screaming over my friends.

1333,rufs9T2rWkejPNdWhd1gNA,6/29/2021,4 star rating,I was surprised to see another bubble tea location open up in my neighborhood so I definitely knew that I had to try it out! The place itself is clean and cozy with no indoor seating. They have a variety of different fruit tea options as well as regular milk tea options. The first drink that I tired from here was Cold Red Bean with Fresh Milk which was just alright in my books. It was definitely creamy but nothing special in my opinion. The other times that I came here I got the Cold Honey Lemon Oolong Tea and Passion Fruit Green Tea both with tapioca and they were both super refreshing. The drink itself was very fresh and definitely perfect for a hot day. The tapioca was perfect - mildly sweet and perfectly chewy (definitely a place with good tapioca in my books). The service itself was quick and they recommend the sugar levels for different sizes of drinks as well as for the drink type which I thought was nice. The only downside of this place is that it is pretty expensive - especially if you add toppings my medium drink came out to around $7 which is definitely on the steep side for bubble tea but once in a while for a treat isn't bad!
1334,rufs9T2rWkejPNdWhd1gNA,5/19/2021,5 star rating,"This location is the third US location of the popular Taiwanese tea chain that showed up in NY a couple of years ago. Â Each location is strategically (at least it seemed to me) in a great location. Â Their flagship store located is in the busy downtown Flushing area while the second store Â is in Manhattan's famous Chinatown area. Â This new location (which opened in early April) is situated on 8th Ave in Brooklyn. Â NY has THREE Chinatowns and Chun Yang and they have a store in each area as of this review. Â The Brooklyn location along 8th Ave is considered the 3rd Chinatown in NY and is a popular destination among locals and visitors who do not want to travel to Manhattan or Queens. Â There is very convenient and close subway access for those who take public transport but also street parking for those who drive or take ride share. The borough of Brooklyn itself is known to be very unique and trendy and a popular destination for food. Â I had missed the GO of the new store but made my way there a short time afterwards to go show support. I am not in that area too often but that will certainly change after this visit. Â The new Chun Yang location was a short walk from the subway station and very easy to find. Â This store is like a cute mini version of the flagship store in Flushing, Â There are no tables, chairs or any seats (compared to Flushing). Â Standing room only. There are only countertop settings along the walls and window. **Due to COVID restrictions, capacity was limited during my visit. Â All employees were masked up and wearing gloves when preparing the drinks. Â As I approached the store initially, there was a very polite gentleman outside who greeted me right away and welcomed me to the store. Â I was expecting lines and a crowd from what I had heard from others and seen on social media but there were only a couple of people waiting for their drinks to be prepped. Â It was most likely due to the volatile weather that NY had been experiencing at that time. Weather haphazardly changed from warm, to cold to rain sometimes all in a week. Â When I went to order, there were two very gracious and hardworking female employees behind the counter. Â Shou Shou was making the drinks while Cindy was taking the orders. Â With any bubble tea establishment, we all have our favorites that we always order but i was not too sure for this visit. Â I asked Cindy what she recommended and she said her favorite is the Latte with Pudding and that is a flavor that I had actually not ordered previously. Â Their pudding is quite good and this was a solid recommendation. Â Since I was there, I also got the Orange Mountain which is a nice refreshing flavor if you are not in the mood for a milk based drink. Â Some customers arrived after me but all the drinks were made in a timely manner. Â The initial visit was actually very pleasant overall. The gentleman who greeted me earlier was actually the manager named Vanness but he works just as hard as his employees. I respect that a lot. Â I had stopped by again a couple of weeks later as I was in the area. Â The manager was not there but there were a lot of new faces behind the counter. Â The very nice girl from my first visit, Cindy, recognized my ugly face right away. Â She was a bit busy as it looked like she was training some new employees. Â I am always surprised when I get recognized anywhere as I tend to be very low key and not very big on chit chat. Â I got the classic Brown Sugar Boba and a Latte w Pudding again. Â My compliments to Vanness and his hardworking crew. Â I can already tell that this new location will be very successful not just because of the location and their established positive reputation but also because of the customer experience they provide."

Ordered their Black Tea Latte with herbal Jelly, and waited for a solid ten minutes. It's a new tea shop, customers orders were slightly disorganized, clerks were just yelling out order numbers for completed drinks. I give a four stars mainly because my drink tasted good, and I liked it. Price is just about average as with any Boba tea places in the neighborhood."

The drinks I got were passion fruit green tea, pomelo oolong tea, and regular oolong tea. You can choose the sugar levels for each drink, The sugar level options are 30, 50 and 70, The pomelo was pretty good very strong tea flavor with some bits of pomelo at the bottom of the drink that drink I opted for 30 percent sugar which I think is perfect. Â The passion fruit drink was sour had 50 percent sugar but was still sour and it also had the passion fruits seeds which I didn't really care for because every time I take a sip there were seeds and I had to spit them out so I wouldn't swallow them. The oolong tea tasted like tea no sourness, Overall wanted to try it out, service was Good."
1338,rufs9T2rWkejPNdWhd1gNA,4/10/2021,5 star rating,"This place is freaken amazing. Â I love Chun Yang so much. Â It's my favorite bubble tea spot and brand. Â All of their teas are amazingly fresh. Â Everything is made with fresh ingredients. Â None of that fake powder stuff. Â The best thing is you can customize. Â The people that work here are also super friendly. Â They speak Cantonese so that is a huge plus if you don't speak English. Â Another huge plus is how close it is to the train station.I first found out about Chun Yang when I was in Toronto. Â I loved trying new teas and this was a few years ago. Â I remember when the guy helping me with my drink in Toronto told me they were opening a Chun Yang in Flushing and he was going to NY at the time to help open the store. Â I was so excited. Â Fast forward a few years later, I've been addicted ever since. Â I live in Brooklyn, but I've always made the drive to the Flushing store to buy multiple drinks to get my Chun Yang fix. Â Now I don't need to do that anymore . Â If you've never had Chun Yang, definitely come here and try their drinks. Â They have something for everyone!!! Â I wish you guys the best of luck. Â See you guys soon!!"

She then asked her coworker to take my boyfriend's order instead. Her coworker seemed to comprehend but after my boyfriend paid and got his receipt, it didn't have aiyu jelly. My boyfriend then asked the workers to add it in and they said they already made the drink so they are not adding it in. The first worker then almost gave my boyfriend the wrong order.

The cumin lamb was my favorite one I've ever had. It was tender and absolutely smothered in cumin spice. The duck my mom loved because of how strong the tea flavor was (I just don't think I'm a tea duck person).The fish fillet was good, nothing to write home about. I wish it was spicier and had more numbing flavor. The couples delight also needed more spice imo. The dan dan noodles were slippery without much chewiness (to my disdain)."

Spring roll -good flavor, crispy & not greasy.We shared a SautÃ©ed Veg.W/tofu and really delicious w/a good mix of Shiitake mushroom, broccoli, lotus root, jicama, bokchoy, sweet pea and tofu cooked to crisp goodness. If this dish had a little sprinkle of Sesame oil it would have been perfection. Ordered the Prawn w/spicy garlic sauce but instead waiter brought us Fried crispy Prawn. Oh well we forgave him and had that instead. Prawn were fresh & tasty. They just have to improve by lightening the thick breading the Prawn was covered with.It was a little late (around 9-10pm) when we dined. Was that reason enough for the toilet to be a mess when I visited it after dinner before leaving the restaurant? All restaurants owe it to their customers to diligently keep toilets clean & fresh."
1352,L5ZsbTGT1G52p11pNf0EXg,12/22/2017,4 star rating,"Named after the Sichuan province, which is nicknamed the land of abundance (plenty), this restaurant hits the spot when you don't want to (or are not able to) make the trek to Flushing. True to the trait that Sichuan cuisine is renowned for, most of the dishes here are numbingly spicy and full of flavor. It is safe to assume that any menu item described as ""braised"" will have a high heat index. I've enjoyed everything I have tried here, but would most strenuously recommend the braised potatoes with chicken, the stir-fried chicken with roasted chilies and Asian green chilies, and the braised filets of fish with Napa cabbage and roasted chilies. Of course, all of these are very spicy, but then, this is a Sichuan restaurant and you should expect to find dishes that will make you sweat as you eat, and remind you of your indulgence the next morning! The restaurant is somewhat hard to spot due to the inconspicuous signage. It is on 58th street, near the southeast corner of 3rd Ave and 58th street."

In my previous visit when they made an error, it was $5 over charge. Being over charged 2X left me with a bad impression, even though the food was ok. Pros:Variety of Bangladeshi cuisine and sweetsReasonably price (if they bill you correctly)Cons:Overcharged 2X and not given apologySmall sitting area in the front is always filled with creepy men that stare The restaurant seems to be getting dirtier and can use a good power wash cleaning. Current NYC cleanliness rating is ""pending"", last time it was B- rating Staff is totally incompetant and does not speak much english or broken english Â Credit card machine is always ""broken"" (Why even have it if they don't want to use it)This place has potential, only if they clean up their act and their premises.But before you go, please visit their NYC Health inspection results and decide on your own. nyc.gov/html/doh/html/riâ¦"

Â That is rare for delicious food and speaks to the quality of the cooking and ingredients. Â The owner and staff are also very friendly in spite of their limited English. Â Although it's true that the restaurant is dingy and crowded, the food is better than what you'd get for three times the price at a fancier place.

I started popping in there a while ago to pick up samosas -- which are fantastic -- on the way home, then decided to stay for a quick bite and was hooked. Ashkar and his staff are very friendly (and super-welcoming to non-Bengalis). I've gone a couple of times with my young kids, who have low spice tolerance, and Ashkar has gone out of his way to bring out mild dishes and point out which stuff is spicy. We don't order off the menu; he just brings out plate after plate of foods for us to try. The kids love the naan and the marinated eggs and the rices and a delicious mild chicken dish I don't know the name of. I've been a big fan of the vindaloos and a bunch of other stuff I've tried. Last time we went, we stuffed ourselves and went home with leftovers, and it all came out to $17. Delicious food, great service!"

The ambiance and service were great. We came in to have a bite, nothing too crazy, so we only ordered 3 dishes to split and some beer and dessert. We really enjoyed the stuffed Quail and Spinaci salad. The quail was tender, and tasty stuffed with sausage. It was just the right amount to keep you wanting more... you cant have too much with Quail. The Spinaci salad was delicious. I feel like you cant mess up a fresh spinach salad with blue cheese and candied walnuts. Our third plate was the braised rabbit which I didn't love. However, I spoiled myself with sous vide rabbit so any other way cooked, just doesn't do it for me anymore. It wasn't as tender and the portion was very small, and included were three tiny polenta triangles. It was okay. The sauce just wasn't special enough to leave me wanting more so I didn't mind the small portion too much. We had two beers which were okay. They can def do much better with their beer selection given that Witch's Brew and GoldStar aren't too far and supply some of the most delicious brews. They can def upgrade that portion of the menu. We're just a bit spoiled here in Bk. Sorry. hahaTo top the meal off, we enjoyed a lovely pana cotta w/ blueberry compote on top. You cant go wrong with that one. Overall enjoyable experience with a few minor and fixable notes.I would recommend trying Convivium Osteria"

I was lucky enough to be served by Angel, who was welcoming and friendly and made excellent wine recommendations. As a solo diner, he provided the perfect balance of conversation and allowing me to enjoy my book. I will absolutely be back.As an aside, it's maybe not the best for vegans.

Â  The interior of the restaurant is nice and perfect for a date night if that's what you're liooking for. Â Dim lights, soft music and beautifully decorated. Â  Food was very good. Â No complaints. Â The service was unfriendly and a bit neglectful. Â After apps were cleared we waited 45 minutes for entrees. Â And my entree took ten minutes longer to come out. Â A friends app was forgotten about and came out 20 minutes after everyone else's. Â No one asked us if we would like more wine. Â We had to call over the server to ask. Â  After a while the music was turned up and we had to ask for it to be lowered. Â No one asked us if we enjoyed our food. Â There were definitely people working the dining room but no one had interest in how we were doing. Â The head server was busy talking to some young women who came in to sit at the bar. Â We were on the pay no mind list. Â  I would say go if you have three hours to spend on dinner and you like unobtrusive service."

Â The only vegetarian entree on the menu is the spiach gnudi which was very good if you're into spinach as the flavors definitely stands out above the asiago sauce and cheese. Â Service was average, they were not willing to make any modifications to accommodate, I really wanted to try the ravioli and was hoping they could omit the duck ragu but I was told that wasn't possible. Â When we ordered wine they only brought over one of two glasses and when we asked for the check we were told the dessert menu haha.The ambiance was quiet, super cute for a date night and I'm pretty sure we were seated next to a couple on their first date which speaks to the vibe.

1394,QUBhr1vPMbcmMzvFQJPcLg,2/17/2020,3 star rating,"We came here for Valentine's Day- our first time going out for the holiday (we usually cook) so we were excited for the celebration of it all. That being said I give this place and experience three stars- okay, fine even but not good or great.Our reservation was at 9:30 pm and after arriving a few minutes before, we were surprised to see 4-5 other couples crammed into the tiny front entry still waiting for their reserved tables as well. A few more came in after us as well and we ended up not being seated until 10 pm. To be fair, there was a table available by the bar five minutes before we ended up sitting but at this point of waiting, we thought what's a few more minutes for a nicer table by the window. That bar table actually ended up leaving because the server never came to their table. So not a good start.Once we were sat at the nice table by the window, we also had to wait about ten or so minutes for water and a server. We placed our orders from the pri fixe menu right away because at this point we were very hungry. Annoyingly, the meal was poorly timed by the restaurant. Our appetizers came out at the same time as the starter bread basket and olives, then the wait between these and the meal was about 30 minutes.For appetizers, I ordered the quail and Beebs ordered the polenta. I've never had quail before and it was nice to try something new. Both were good dishes. For main course, he had the steak and I had the lobster linguine. Both dishes came out on cold plates which if you know anything about food, is a recipe for disaster if you're having a hot meal. Also the mashed potatoes they came with his steak or lukewarm. My pasta was definitely forgettable. The lobster and the linguine were both under season and lacking flavor.When we finally got desert (which was also another long wait), this was probably the redeeming part of the meal. I got the pine nut tart and he got the tiramisu. The tiramisu was fine- definitely not the best I've ever had but my pine nut tart was delicious. It was crunchy and sweet from honey. A much needed plus after a forgettable meal.Well this is all happening, we had the server come over one time in the entire meal to check if everything was OK. The staff was friendly when they were attentive but they were barely attentive so it's not saying much. So definitely not worth the hassle if there is a hassle to come to this place. There's plenty of other good Italian spots you can go to for a much more memorable meal."
1395,XQ6hGg_xgkKyK293lBdF1w,7/31/2022,5 star rating,Beautiful decor and delicious food! Came here with the intention to do the restaurant week dinner deal but decided to order from the regular menu for more options. Roti prata - the roti was huge and not super oily. Only thing that could have made it better is if the dipping curry had potatoes. Chicken satay - 4 skewers that were smothered in a peanut sauce. Chicken was really tender!Spiral curry puff - quite oily but it is deep fried. Came with 2 which were sizable enough to split. Rendang beef - beef was perfectly tender and sauce had a bit of a kick to it but it wasn't super spicy. Portion could have been bigger especially for being $28. Singapore Hokkien Mee - my favorite dish! Portion was huge and I really enjoyed the seafood gravy. Sambal fried rice - delicious and comes with shrimp chips and fried egg. Only thing that could have make it better was if the egg was runny instead of being well done.

We had a party of 5 and ordered the following to share: Ayam Goreng (Crispy Chicken)Mamak Mee GorengRoti Prata,Chili Crab (Limited) with fried bunNasi LemakRendang Beef They gave us a box of gloves to use for the crab. It was 2 crabs for $100. Kinda pricey in my opinion. The sauce was thick and savory. Dipping the fried bun in the sauce was yummy. The crab was a little difficult and messy to eat it. Ayam Goreng had crispy skin and the chicken was juicy. Nasi Lemak was a burst of flavors. I didn't really care for Mamak Mee Goreng and rendang beef. Beef was a little dry and not tender. For dessert, we ordered Panna Cota. We waited like 30 minutes or more. I had to wave down another server to check on our order. She came out with it within seconds. Looks like the dessert was waiting in the kitchen. Other than that, service was ok. Overall there were some hits and misses. Prices were on the pricey side."

I got Calamari Singapura, Singaporean Noodle and Durian Ice Cream with Jack's Abbey draft beer; my friend got Satay Asam, Laksa, and Kaya Jam. We both loved what we got. The portion size was generous, so I had some leftover for the next day. Calamari was very crispy even when I heated it up with a regular pan the next day. The Singaporean noodle was also great with abundant vegetables and tofu. It was especially well paired with the draft beer. It was a great value that I got to try an appetizer, entrÃ©e, and dessert with $45. I want to go back to try other dishes that are not part of the restaurant week deal as well."

I can see this being a great option for group gatherings or work dinners.Our party of 3 got the murtabak roti, shrimp sambal fried rice, nasi lemak, and laksa to share. Everything across the board was great, but no dish was super notable. My favorite by a smidge would probably be the roti. I got the Archipel cocktail, a flaming cocktail that comes in a peacock cup. Very aesthetically pleasing, but unfortunately I didn't think the smokiness from the flame was super compatible with the rest of the drink. I wouldn't recommend my own drink, but my friend had a lychee rose which she said was very good.I think the best qualities of this place are its ambiance and service. The staff was incredibly attentive, and the food came out quicker than I expected. Although it was busy, it never got too crowded; I appreciated that we were able to spend a solid amount of time comfortably talking and eating without feeling like we were overstaying our welcome."

We ordered the chili crab, hainanese chicken, roti prata and the mee goreng noodles. The sauce for the chili crab was really good. I have super low spice tolerance and was able to tolerate it for the most part since it's more sweet and sour than spicy. We got the fried bun to go with it and dunking it in the sauce was delicious. I will caveat this and say that the crab itself was difficult to eat and open, as always, and I wished they pre-cracked some of the parts or gave us bibs because the splatter was intense when cracking it ourselves. FYI the chili crab is market price and was $100 when we went. Everything else was just okay. The service was ok as well though I did find that it was hard to flag down a waiter at times."

It's bigger than it looks on their menu pictures. It's spicy and has hint of curry flavor. It is perfectly fried. We also got the roti telur, which is stuffed with eggs. It comes with a delicious peanut sauce. For main dish, we got the Sambal Belchan with chicken. It's cooked with shrimp paste and has lots of other veggies. I loved the okra in it. There's a unique green bean in the dish. It has a slight bitter taste but you can't taste it with the dish unless you eat it alone. The only thing I wish the dish had was a little bit more salt. The Sambal Fried Rice with chicken was delicious. It came with an egg and some chips, which added a lot of crisp and flavor. Again, I wish there was a bit more salt in it. We got some lychee cocktails that were pretty and delicious. Forgot the names though. I recommend this place to everyone. It's a good introduction to Singaporean food."

It cost 3.50 for a side order of corn beef hash so to be charge 5 dollars for something I am substituting was ridiculous as I could of got the item I substituted and a side of corn beef hash at a lower price. When calling the restaurant the first time I should of been told I would be charged and would of changed it right there, but of course it would be better for them to charge and up feee after order is placed so a consumer would see changes after receiving the order I've worked in restaurant business and this how the game works. I later called soon as I seen the charges and told the person on the phone this should of been related to me prior and bc it wasn't I do not want the order it was sneaky on their end and I will never waste a dime at this establishment. Then the biggest kicker is I called grubhub to verify if it was canceled as the man on the phone said it will and to my surprise it was not and the people of Julia's is saying I received this order how?

The seats are not assigned as you buy the tickets so even though we got there 20-25 min early we got seats on stool chairs without back rest. I needed to order a virgin mojito and the waitress said it can be made unsweetened but it actually was very sweet and they had to remake it for me and the second one was less sweet but still pretty sweetened. The theme of the jokes was mainly sexual which is fine in moderation but lame when it's what 6 comedians talk about. Even though they mentioned in their email that min age is 13 with a parent, apparently there was a 10 year old boy they let in. I felt uncomfortable for the inappropriate sexual jokes discussed in front of that boy, for almost two hours. Overall, I had a much better experience with Gotham comedy club, for the same price."

Decent prices and good drinks. The service, however, was awful. Truly hate to leave words like this.My girlfriend and I were sitting in the center of the room, and heard the server (half a dozen rows behind us taking orders) more than the act we came to see. Incredibly distracting. When he came to us for our second drink-two item minimum per person btw, standard for most clubs-he practically put his mouth IN my girlfriend's ear. Don't know what he said but he was there for a good ~15-20 seconds. She was pretty upset afterwards. Not to mention, she had barely even made it halfway through her first drink. She tried to tell him she wasn't ready for a second but he insisted...even though we had planned on ordering a second drink. Not a great way to enforce the minimum, completely killed the vibe.The show itself was, unfortunately, mediocre. It was hard to appreciate the comics (some of which were good!) as the HOST of the show had such strange, awkward, uncomfortable energy. Didn't really know how to control the crowd and spoke very redundantly. I think they rubbed off on the performers a little, as their morale was noticeably low even while they stepped onstage; even the better acts. As a performer myself and a frequent comedy club goer, last night was pretty disappointing. Gonna stick to Stand Up NY."

The atmosphere was nice, lots of good laughs, crowd is big but not too big. Hard to find parking, so I Uber here. This will now be my go to spot whenever I come back to Â New York!!"

We had a very good meal at the Turkish/Mediterranean spot next door and enjoyed the late show here!I was a little wary of them seating my friend and I right at the front center stage but they did not roast us too badly! I wish they had more restrooms but alas it is the city and a comedy club so it is not surprising that there was a line for the restroom consistently throughout the show. With multiple rooms performing it was understandable. I have a mobility issue and the folks who work here were kind enough to lead me to the elevator at the end of the show. It would have been nice to have been given that option at the start of the show (going downstairs is much harder than going up the stairs for me). Anyway, exiting was a breeze. I was a little disappointed to see the mandatory fees/gratuities we had to pay for our beverages but understand also that is how they survive in the city.

It's like she didn't care if the beginning of our experience was important lol We had come early for a show and my mother had some questions as we never been there and she was very uninterested in interacting with us. She was more interested in her phone. One of the questions my mother had was about getting downstairs where the stage is as she has bad knees. She wanted to know if there is an elevator or something and the hostess just said no with no empathy. My mother then asked if she can get a head start on going down the stairs as to not hold up the crowd. The hostess was like sure whatever. Fast forward the basement where the show is- omg it really needs renovation and TLC. It was truly pitiful. The waiter made me order my 2 drink minimum at the same time. I told him what if I don't like the first drink lol he didn't seem to understand or care. I get the logic but I been to other comedy clubs and they serve the drinks throughout the show so for me this was very unaccommodating. Instead of trying their margarita I decided to play safe and get a beer and water. They tried to cramp as many people as possible into one table... half the club was filled up so there was space. I thought it was a poor decision to force people to sit on top of each other. They had a curtain handing on by a thread to block where the entertainers sit and I'm assuming staff. The bathroom was not attended and Â had not TP in one of the two stalls. I will say I enjoyed the comedians, I can't say anything about them as they did their job. I just found the venue to have let themselves go and even though I never been here from research and the photos they have posted all around this place was apparently booming at one point. Not the case anymore. Not worth the money."

She gave everyone an attitude to everyone who wanted in, and made it seem like we were a nuisance to her for coming in and ordering, she also had her air pod in the entire time.

They operate primarily a take out operation, however there is a little seating inside as well. If you decide to sit inside they have a few seats at a counter right in front of where they make the dumplings. The dumplings are very high quality, and they have a few different options to choose from (including 4 sweet choices). The orders come in servings of either 6 or 10, and either steamed or pan fried. I got a 10 pan fried dumpling order of their ""sampling platter"" and it was very filling. The sampling platter contained their pork, chicken, shrimp, and veggie dumplings. The pork dumpling was phenomenal, chicken and shrimp were solid, and veggie was gross.In addition to dumplings, the place also has a few other Asian treats including things such as miso soup and bubble tea (in the summer only).8"

The restaurant was not even crowded and my waitress was nowhere to be found. My second visit it was better. This time I had a waiter and he was attentive and efficient especially with how big the crowd was that night. So for that I would give them a rating of 4.

There is a small sign at the bar that says cash only and the menu has it on the last page but it would have been GREAT if the waitress mentioned it seeing as that's the last thing a customer would expect. Nonetheless, I was excited to be here as I've heard the food and music was good. I was so torn on what to get so I settled for the shrimp and white rice. My friend got the fried fish which is probably the best thing they had on their menu. My meal was so underwhelming and the pitcher of Caipirinha we got was so watered down it gave me a headache. Only plus was the DJ was pretty good and the patrons were all very friendly. The staff could be much more attentive and the food could be SIGNIFICANTLY better."

I no longer enjoy getting subpar food in a super loud place with people bumping my table. However, I can appreciate that some ppl like this scene and if you like the type of music its great. They do have a full bar, but I cant speak to that.If you come here with a group, I suggest getting an outside table so you can enjoy the atmosphere without the madness."

Further, the staff was extremely rude and unapologetic, blaming it on someone being new and not knowing, and saying ""what do you want us to do, call an ambulance?"" instead of comping the whole meal or at least being gracious/considerate."

I ordered a braised rib and then after they said they were out so I said fine, I'll have all the sides of the rib but the meat will be the steak. They came out with steak and French fries and then AFTER told me that they didn't have the sides I asked for so they substituted with what they had. Secondly, the drinks are soooo tiny they might as well be shot glasses, so I ordered a pitcher of margarita (~$55) which tasted like straight up lime juice. I told the bartender to add more juice to maybe fix it, but it didn't help so it was basically a waste of a pitcher. Third, the waitress didn't come to check on us ONCE! The bar back basically helped and checked on us more than her and they added suggested tip for a table of 4 (that wasn't actually suggested, it was mandatory). I wish I could've gave everything to the bar back and not the lazy waitress Â I hate leaving negative reviews but the 2 stars was generous. If the service was better and the waitress was courteous, a fully stocked restaurant and better bartender, I would've been pleased. Everything complained above is 100% fixable."

A group of us had gone and ordered 2 Caipirinha pitchers (at $52 each) and paid for one of them. At the end when we went to pay for the other, the same bartender who had served us the pitchers and had received the money for payment of 1 pitcher claimed we had not paid for either pitcher and insisted we owe him $104 rather than $52. I recommend asking for a receipt upon payment.Other than that, it is a great spot! On Sundays they have a live Brazilian band and everyone is dancing. Very fun and authentic atmosphere. You feel like you are at a local bar in Brazil. The food is not bad either. I ordered the bife acebolado and it was decent. Very large portion. The rice and beans and veggies were ok.

Okay fine we will pay it maybe he miss understood us but then when we decided to pay and leave the suggested tip that was on the receipt, he decides to come back with the cash we left him and count it in front of us and said, ""that's it? that's all your going to leave me?"" I think that is extremely rude and the fact the he had the audacity to ask for more? why would you even do that? Then we gave him more because we felt uncomfortable, he then decided to grab it, count it, and said ""that's it?"" again and told us never mind ill keep what you already gave me and left."

Â I did really like the green tea oreo ice cream and was surprised how well the tea flavor and oreo bits went together. Â Another favorite is the almond cookie, which I've gotten in previous visits. Â I love the bits of almond cookie mixed in for that added texture. Staff is very friendly and aren't stingy about giving out samples.

For an area that is severely lacking in the ice cream department, you've gotta give this place some love for carrying the legacy all the way to this crazy part of town.Don't expect the amount of flavors over here to be as broad as the OG location. After all, this is their offspring. I am a bit surprised that for such a fine establishment, that of all the places in Flushing, they chose this dingy location (Flushingheads, you know). There aren't as many flavors as the Chinatown location, but if you've ever stood in the long line at that location, you'll know that asking for a sample means holding the long line. They don't get the same kind of love here, so at least you can get to try most of the flavors, and without the long wait. The service is really great here, too, and they give you a free pocky stick with your ice cream. I highly recommend the Green Tea Oreo, Almond Cookie, Red Velvet, Green Tea, Black Sesame, and Zen Butter. If you're feeling adventurous, the Durian flavor will put you through some magic.If you're already familiar with the flavors at Chinatown Ice Cream Factory, all you need to know is that they carry some of their most popular flavors at this location and you don't need to look at another 45-minute, 15-mile journey to get your red bean ice cream cake, only to come home with a pool of melted red bean-flavored cream."

I got two flavors:- Dan Tat: this was so good, like a custard - it may be my new favorite flavor from this brand (replacing Zen Butter)- Matcha & Cookies: the matcha flavor was pronounced, and the bitterness nearly as strong as the sweetness. I did like it, but liked it less than the dan tat, which was surprising since green tea and cookies & cream are my favorite ice cream flavors"
1474,MMg42dFFw9r7KKroTX9xKQ,12/27/2020,5 star rating,So glad we don't have to go to Chinatown anymore for their ice cream. This new location is closer to our house. Their almond cookie ice cream is my favorite! It's kinda hidden away in flushing but still very packed. Come early cause they tend to sell out Â of their popular flavors at night.

Vietnamese coffee!Love their customized ice cream cakes with 3 ice cream flavors of our choice. Last time, the husband ordered an ice cream cake with lychee, mango, and strawberry for Mother's Day celebration. Not only was the penmanship nice, the interior was delicious. Next time, I think I'll substitute strawberry with green tea as the bottom layer though. Not that the strawberry wasn't good, but I think green tea would have made the ice cream cake even more perfect in my opinion!"

We found this diner on yelp and the reviews looked great, so we had high expectations.The french onion soup was horrible. Idk what it was but it tasted like garlic and vinegar water. I asked the waitress if this was a different type of french onion... trying to figure out why it tasted nothing like it. She asked and came back to tell us ""it is the chef's version of it."" Maybe they should note that on the menu or maybe the chef doesn't know what a french onion soup is supposed to taste like. It was AWFUL. Stay away from that one. Next came our entree's. The power wrap wasn't bad, but the southern skillet was completely burnt. I don't know how they even served that to us. The bacon and potatoes were completely black and the cheese on top of the eggs wasn't fully melted. I don't give one star reviews often and this is in no way the waitress' fault, but something needed to be said. The menu mentioned they were under new management, so keep that in mind if this is a spot you usually go to. I hope others don't experience this as well."

For dinner, we got the avocado + pepper jack hero (comes with grilled chicken + chipotle mayo), and the chicken parm sandwich and curly fries. We had to wait for our food a little longer than usual because there were a lot of take out orders that were being fulfilled. The waitress offered her apologies and it was nice to know that she was keeping track of our orders! The curly fries were so crispy and fresh! I highly recommend it with the chipotle mayo sauce. The sandwiches were equally delicious as well! Comfort food at its finest. The manager (?) or owner (?) of the diner was so nice and offered us complimentary mimosas! They were great and added more to our experience here. We noticed a lot of regulars coming to dine here and they can add us to that list too!

I got my eye on the emptied booth to our left and luckily the server seated us there. Yes, it was right by the doors so we are going to feel the draft. I haven't been here for a while and the brunch special menu's price changed to $16.95 because they are including alcohol now. Remember you can only choose one drink to go with your brunch entree. The wording of the menu was misleading under the Brunch title. It really looked like you can order juice, cocktail, and a hot drink...anyways!Brunch menu: Cocktails: Mimosa (2)Cali Eggs Benedict (1) Eggs Benedict (1) - the English Muffin wasn't toasted but just around the edges, the Canadian bacon wasn't grill but just around the edges, and the hashbrowns were bland...I added salt and pepper...still didn't taste goodMy friend asked for the check and no one came over. I saw a woman by the register and flagged her over to redeem my Yelp check-in of 15% off the bill when you spent $25 or more. No one came to swipe my card until I had to flag someone. The service was eh and the food was ehOther brunch spots are always on point with their food and service but Parkway you disappointed me today. I will be taking my money elsewhere!"

Â The waitress was rushed and acted like we were bothering her to order. The hookah was brought to the table 15 minutes later and the gentleman that brought it said we are closing in 15 minutes. I cant blame the second gentleman but the waitress should have mentioned they were closing earlier than their stated time on the website and door (midnight) or at least within 30 min of us sitting down. Â The water I ordered was room temperature and the ginger tea was okay. Â Then they added a 20% tip to the bill and stood at the table waiting for us to pay quickly (mind you we have had the hookah for about 5 minutes at this time). Very disappointed"

We ordered mint pineapple shishas and a couple of pitchers of sangria and mojitos. Not much of a surprise that the mojitos were weak, but as we already had a few drinks we made the best of it. The sangrias proved to be better tasting and stronger. The waitress seemed to be a bit reluctant to seat us at first (large party about 10 or more people), but Â ended up being was attentive at checking our coals and keeping the drinks going through the night. Deducting 2 stars because someone burned her calf on the exposed radiator pipes. It's November and in such a small place precaution should be taken to make sure everything is covered. When she spoke to the ""manager"" he just laughed it off, went to the back and seemed to continue laughing at her. Absolutely no sign of remorse was shown and he did not seem to care about her situation."
1502,bMju8cdz4RdJVoPvbWQqSQ,2/4/2019,3 star rating,"Given how much I hate the requirements, the built in tip, and the service here, I somehow end up going back to this place. It is probably because it is the most reliable and convenient place for me. It is right by Port Authority so after hookahing, I can go home. What I don't like about this place is how they charge you for water. They don't have tap water (so they say...), but you can see some people are drinking tap water. I guess some people get preferential treatment. However, I did have an interesting night and met a group of fun ladies one night when I was just hookahing with my girl friend one night. The ladies liked how my friend was tall and tatted. We hookahed as a group, they gave us some of their fries, and taught my friend how to twerk. Okay fine.... due to this, I am adding another star. There are better hookah places out there, but if you need to get home via Port Authority after a long day of drinking all day and hookahing, this is a very convenient place. I advise you do the bulk of your drinking somewhere else and just order one drink here. The booze is not that good (especially the wine). But! Tito's is considered house."

Didn't have a chance to enjoy the food as I had already eaten before I arrived. Music like this should be banned from restaurants. I won't be back here, there are too many restaurants n hookah spots in New York that play decent music and ban the use of the N word and or refer to white people as white trash in their music.

I have no complaints about the hookah since they have the good coconut charcoal that's smooth. Pricing, on the other hand, is above average for their 'special' hookah that's not so special. As for the menu, the fattoush salad is always absolutely fresh and delicious and I often crave this so much that I order it from seamless and it always hits the spot!"

It's a decent fried chicken that's a bit overpriced, especially when you realize that you get only half piece of the breast for what you paid. Batter is crispy and airy, while the meat is some of the juiciest anywhere. Problem is the complete lack of flavor. If they get that fixed, I'll be a regular. Otherwise, there are much better fried chicken in NYC."

I also ate the Mac n cheese side which was good side dish.As I was finishing off my dish and on my last piece of waffle a small bug came out of my dish. It wasn't a roach and it wasn't a fruit fly as I didn't see any wings. But I didn't want to alarm anyone so just killed it and told the waiter about it. Showed the dead bug on my napkin. He was super apologetic and said the manager will be told. Waited a bit and they comped my dish. I was satisfied with that, but I lost my appetite from it. He offered a dessert for the road, I however declined. I really wish that didn't happen as I really was going to give them a more positive review."

The chicken was also delicious, although the skin fell off which I wasn't obsessed with but it was so flavorful. I was hoping for a bit more crunch.The cinnamon roll was also delicious! The cream cheese frosting wasn't overwhelming and it was huge. The serving sizes were great for the prices. I'll definitely be back!"

Be sure to try one of the desserts if your still hungry never had a chance as of yet been too full.

Nearly the size of my face!The chicken biscuit was good - the sauce profile tasted a bit like buffalo ranch.I usually don't love biscuits but this one was just the right line between crunchy and being too dry. The chicken was also not too dry, good breading!Price (5/5) - no words this was the right price for the value I got.Service (5/5) - phenomenal, waitstaff were really nice, gave great recommendations and super friendly.

The first thing I noticed was the ample seating and the arrangement. It made it very cozy looking and inviting to stay after ordering. There were lots of photos around as well to look at as we waited for our order. We ordered 3 different drinks. There was a selection of sandwiches and also coffee. Hip hop music was playing in the background and the staff playfully danced around as they prepared our order. We were also pleased with our drinks. I went with the strawberry and banana with elderflower. It was really good. My cousin had a drink with turmeric in it. She actually considered ordering a second one since it was that good. My little cousin had a raspberry flavored d smoothie that she liked as well. After we left I noticed two more locations I hadn't noticed before. I will definitely try them out again!

I also got the cappuccino recently and it was horrible. It only tasted like milk and was over $4. I definitely won't be coming here again and will go to Oren's which is so close."

Plus, all the pretty social media pictures don't hurt (which is how I first found out about it ... no shame). But, while the juice was certainly colorful and tasty, I have a few nits: (1) The music was BOOMING. I love 90s pop as much as the next person but it was hard to think and work and have a conversation. I noticed how the employees had to keep asking for orders to be repeated back. Maybe lowering the volume would help? Speaking of ...(2) The guys behind the counter seemed a bit more focused on playing with their phones and talking with each other. Meh, whatever. I just want my drink. And I get that not everyone needs to be effusively excited about whatever product they're slinging, but, in a new chain, that kind of enthusiasm would have been soul-warming to see. The too-cool-for-school airs were annoying. (3) The granola in the yogurt bowls could use just a little more sweetness. I ended up crumbling some spare Nature Valley granola bars into the yogurt. I only really stopped in here to see what the fuss was about and I'm not sure I'd come back, if only because the juices are in the high range and I can always just eat an apple to get the vitamins."

I would give this place a 5 if it weren't for the prices. The small cost me around 8 dollars and looked tiny! I attached a picture of the small size compared to the large size for reference. I recommend getting the larger size because it is around 2 dollars more, yet much bigger. Other than that, I would definitely go back to get another drink."

We ordered their truffle fries and although I did not have any the review on it was very positive. I did have a few pomegranate margaritas and although they were pretty weak, they were tasty. Also had hookah, no complaints. Now to what gave this cafÃ© its low rating. At one point I asked for a round of tequila shots, without asking what kind of tequila our sever comes back with some type of house tequila, I prefer casas or patron but I digress. Immediately after cheers'ing and taking the shot we all looked at each other like somethings wrong here. The shot tasted like a tequila shot that was watered down. Now maybe the server thought we were lit as they were serving us a lot of drinks, which again weren't strong. When I told the server about the watered down shot he said and I am paraphrasing "" Usual tequila is usually 40% but because there is a school in the vicinity the tequila I gave you was 24%"" like for one how does that correlate and secondly, don't you think this would be worth mentioning to your customers before giving them BS shots?That actioned seem shady and because of that and that weak story I am giving this place a 1.5."

But after the terrible and rude service I have received last night at this establishment I am forced to write this review because of the disrespect I received from the waiter and management. The drinks were terrible and watered down and I was rushed out. I understand the 25% occupancy new rule but telling people they have to leave after 20mins is absolutely ridiculous and money hungry. They wouldn't allow my party to finish our hookah or order a second round of drinks or food. Never again! This place definitely won't last treating PAYING customers this way. My sisters birthday was completely ruined.

Even though we paid for Groupon the person who answered said I still have to spent $30 extra for which I replied yes I will be ordering hookah. When we got there place was really empty which we didn't mind as it was nice way to enjoy quiet evening. The place look very old the couches had big 2 hole. When we sat near the window we felt really cold so we moved to another couch near wall side but the whole place was cold. We spent 3 hours wearing our winter coat & I had to use bathroom 3-4 times. We informed the server but she was cold too and was not able to do anything about it. Outside it was cold snowy in 20 degrees. It was too late for us to leave as we already ordered our food & hookah.We ordered fresh fruit hookah for $30 which was really good & they changed the coal twice in 3 hrs.Food is prefix platter with appetizer, entree, dessert & drink. We really enjoyed the food platter. I ordered Rose wine which I didn't liked it so that was a waste.Service was good. In the end they charge us $10 in taxes $20 in gratuity which I think is a steep amount.Even with Groupon of $45, I spent extra $60 with hookah.Its a nice decent place for hookah more like 3.5 star. They can upgrade few things especially fix the heater in this cold weather."

Our server brought over a bottle of Evian and when my friend said no, tap is fine he refused to serve her tap water citing that legally he doesn't have to serve water unless we ordered food. Clearly he wanted us to pay extra for the bottled water. This place is trash and to refuse an already paying customer a glass of free tap water so you can charge extra for bottled is down right disgusting greedy behavior. While we were getting ready to leave the table adjacent to us (who had a different server) was being served iced glasses of water! It was infuriating. Avoid this place at all costs!

1540,G1HUAEpZcNHXO1V1gLoASQ,3/25/2019,4 star rating,"Been a regular here recently and it's a great spot for a meal. Staff is awesome, music playlist is good. I tried most of the items on the menu per the pics, so here's my 2 cents:Fav - Bodhi noodles and Phetchaburi basil chicken are the best. Sauces in both are superb, esp the curry-like sauce in the Bodhi noodles. Felt these 2 were their most authentic dishesGood - Bangkok Khao Man Gai crispy chicken, Drunk n hungry noodles, Queens curry, are amongst their popular dishes, all are very good. Curry comes in big bowl, way more sauce than rice so I'd recommend packing the remainder sauce and make a home meal, or two, out of it Meh - Thai Fried rice wasn't anything fancy, get it if you crave fried rice. Bus noodles, good noodles, but not too much flavor here. Spicy CK was disappointing, I see the potential but mine was overdosed w fish sauce. I see other pictures where it looks to be different than mine so maybe they are still tweaking it. I would give it another chance in futureSkip - Fluffertella, points for creativity but it was a thick dinner roll w slab of Nutella. I went overly aggressive with 2 on my own, oops. While may be good on it's own, it doesn't really jive w the Thai entree beforehand...Overall it's a decent local joint, no frills, quick in and out for fuel up. Vege options are a bit lacking in terms of ingredients so I often pick a protein. Great portion size, good food, fair prices, it's why I haven't done groceries in awhile :) bon appetite!"

So pathetic such terrible customer service- was in the area looking for delivery so we went with this place- huge mistake. I called around 7- maybe 7:05 ... and it's currently 8:32. Still waiting. Delivery estimate was so off and took so long and I called multiple times- they clearly were ignoring my calls as they went straight to voicemail and my friend, using her phone, called them and they immediately picked up. They are a bunch of clowns running this place and the employee continued to argue with me on the phone. I really regret ordering from here and they have completely wasted my time and I'm not excited for their food. What a disgrace. UPDAT!! Got my food and it taste as bad as the service!! NO FLAVOR THAI FOOD! So terrible .. the pad Thai tastes like absolutely no sauce no seasoning and the fried rice was slightly less worse but still bad. Such a shame.

Next was Bodhi Noodle - Â it tasted like a mix of Pad Thai and Tom Kha Gai, except with ramen noodles. I can't wait to order it again.The King's Curry was exquisite, with peanuts, big pieces of potato, and large slices of carrot and a nice kick.I'm looking forward to ordering again and further exploring the menu."

1557,G1HUAEpZcNHXO1V1gLoASQ,1/6/2022,3 star rating,"Terms has been on my mind for years. An acquaintance of mine worked there and had posted about it, so I followed them while I lived in Florida and eyed their beautiful daily croissant selection. I even had a dream about finally going there one night. Last month, I made it to Terms! I'll start by saying that there weren't many croissants available and I felt like the pastry selection wasn't necessarily reflecting what's on their Instagram feed. Nonetheless, there were great options -- I had a fruit-filled donut. I also ordered their rendition on a grilled cheese and the tomato soup that came with it, along with some matcha lemonade.The donut was good -- it was not great. I've had better vegan donuts (Valhalla in St. Pete, Donut Run in DC, Voodoo in Portland). The grilled cheese and tomato soup were good, I liked them a lot. They were not anything impressive, but I felt like the taste was nice. My matcha lemonade was also good.While Terms provides a diverse menu and beautiful baked goods, I don't think the quality of their food is actually on point, which is a shame because I considered this a must-visit and had literally *dreamed* about it for years. The service was also abysmally slow, and not in the COVID sense -- they were fully staffed but pretty indifferent. It was not crowded. There are so many great vegan spots in NYC that I have barely had a chance to explore --Â if you're also vegan and visiting the area, I would go elsewhere."

We make trips into NYC from an hour away (without traffic!) just for the bakery items. I follow their Instagram religiously at this point. I've never had anything that wasn't excellent from Terms - and everything is vegan!!! Their almond croissant is incredible. It's always sold out by the time I make it in, but the one time it wasn't, I died and went to heaven. Of all the special croissants we've tried (strawberry pistachio, hibiscus, sweet potato cranberry, PB&J) the carrot cake one has been my favorite. The croissant is light and flakey and buttery, and then the special fillings take them over the top. Their special rolls are also always delicious. Seriously, you can't go wrong with anything from behind the bakery counter. I'll definitely be trying their breakfast sandwiches soon!"

Â Sunday was the day we were going to spend in Brooklyn on her agenda and the days leading up all she could talk about was ""croissants, croissants, croissants"". Â Literally, days prior all she could talk about was the fact she was going to have vegan croissants. Â I didn't seem the big deal, but was just going along with the flow.We took the subway to Brooklyn and after a short walk we were able to find this place. Â I sat down as I looked at the menu and told her what I wanted to order. Â She came back outside and said YOU NEED TO LOOK AT ALL OF THESE PASTRIES INSIDE. Â Shrugging her off, I still didn't understand what all of the big fuss was all about. Â She came back outside with three pastries, where we had only tried half of one....The almond croissant. Â Let me tell you, those two bites that I took (because I wanted to save room for our brunch order) was literally enough for me to drag myself into inside dining, convince her to buying TWO more almond croissants for later in the night and a cinnamon roll (which I have yet to try yet). Â That almond croissant was so flaky and the filling inside of it was mouth watering good! If you go for JUST the almond croissant then you have made the right decision...but we got sandwiches alsoWe both shared the BALT breakfast croissant which had the perfect combination of avocado, tomato, mixed greens (which i'm hesitant on during a hot sandwich but tasted great), a yummy chili aioli that added the perfect spice, but the BACON was the best vegan bacon that I have ever tasted! Perfect. Â As well as the sausage, egg, mixed green, mayo on foccacia which I had thought was better than the croissant but that was a great debate that we both have had as we thought both sandwiches were better than the other. Â Prices are reasonably priced for the quality that you get.Staff super friendly!Don't be a fool, you NEED to check this place out.

While we oogled at the menu for a bit, we opted for items out of their case for our first visit. While the quiche looked delicious, I really wanted to try their breakfast bomb. We ordered one each person, but think that it certainly could have been shared. It was a lot larger than what I had expected, but very filling. Nonetheless, it was delicious and would certainly recommend.We also had the fruit danish, which was on the sweeter side, but the fruit was fresh and the pastry was perfect. hard to believe that the items we got were vegan as it was so similar to non-vegan varieties that we've had before. they got very busy at one point, and only had one barista taking orders/making drinks. it took nearly 25 minutes to get our drinks, which may not have been ok for someone that was needing to grab and go. i am sure they have their reasons, but there were no plates or cups for use, which was odd as it felt wasteful to take to go boxes when we were dining in. if you're vegan or plant-based, this establishment is a must try in nyc! the space is very cute and the eats are a great way to start off your day. will certainly be back!"

I got one of their specialty cocktails-- the Coco Vin-- which was perfect for a hot summer evening. It is a gin drink with strong citrus flavors (I think fresh lemon and lime juice), not too sweet, and then finished with coconut water!

They greeted me when I reached the register and thanked me as I left. The two register girls took orders in person, on the phone, and made sure that everyone was being helped. The kitchen staff were extremely busy from all the orders.Promptly at 9:00pm, my four large pizzas and some other misc stuff arrived at my door. The pizzas were still hot and the delivery guy was well mannered. He warned me about the temperature of the pizzas but I kind of ignored it since I did not expect it to be that hot. Great service from my first order ! Will buy again sometime !"

Have ordered from this place countless times and delivery is always quick with the food still hot. I placed an online order 10 minutes before their closing time once (I was desperately hungry) and they called to apologize, saying that they were already all cleaned up which was perfectly understandable and nothing to be mad about. Very polite. When you think of a Papa John's you don't think of slices, you think pies and wings - even their desserts are large - so I don't get all these people angry that they don't sell slices? If you want slices go to a neighborhood pizza shop. There are different shops for different things."

But i do agree with the other person that this does look like a couples spot, although they wasn't all couples only in there but i saw alot. It doesn't matter to me though cause even if you go with a group of friends you'll have a nice time, the lighting in here is cool and i love the fact that it's not super crowded. It really feels like a lounge. You can chill and talk or dance your ass off. The DJ in my opinion was great i went on a Saturday night and he was playing everything and anything you can think of. The bouncers were cool. We didn't have to pay to get in but i believe the guys do and if you do i think it was like 10 bucks or something like that. But love it.

I personally like this club because they always have room to dance. I know for most people it may seem kinda empty but I perfer a place where I can move around than a place where I have no place to move and am basically stuck 2 inches away from a couple who decide to grind.Their food is good and the music is great for dancing.

After hours of just having fun, dancing, and barely drinking, I was approached by one of the bouncers who told me I had to leave. I asked why and he said I just had to go and that he'd make me go if I didn't start walking towards the door. So I said fine. We went outside and I asked him why he kicked me out of the bar. He said, ""Someone said you were sleeping at the bar so I had to bring you outside."" Funny, I didn't know you could sleep standing up, because that's what I was doing when he approached me. I told him, ""You know I wasn't sleeping."" And he and the guy outside said, ""Well we're not letting you back inside."" I said okay and pulled out my phone to record and take a picture to report them later. The bouncer literally smacks the phone out of my hand and says, ""No you're not recording this."" I'm thinking, ""What the hell??"" He goes back inside while I'm getting my phone and another guy (who later reveals he doesn't even work there, he just wanted to mess with me, but apparently he knows the staff) laughs at and argues with me that they're not letting me back in. I, again, try to take a picture and this guy smacks the phone out of my hand. I honestly don't understand why they kicked me out. Was I talking to someone they didn't want me to? Did I look at someone the wrong way? I'll never know. But the fact that they used a flimsy ""you were sleeping"" excuse leads me to think they didn't want me there for personal reasons. Now, I have been going through a rough time, been dealing with depressing thoughts and anxiety, and I thought just going out with friends to a bar would cheer me up. Never have I felt so disrespected on a night out. And by the staff, which is unfortunate, because I thought the place was great beforehand."

Everything was so outstandingly delicious and we loved being able to watch the chef/owner create our dishes and listen to his conversations Yes, I saw other reviews comment that the tagliolini was too peppery but *ahem* it's cacio e Pepe. It's perfectly peppery. PERFECT I SAY! Don't change it please. Hubby ordered the bolognese and that was incredibly delicious as well. The charred octopus: so tender and the rice beans were interesting, never had them before. The little chorizo slivers heightened the flavor and I think there was a squeeze of lemon in there that brought everything together. So good. Go! Now!"

This place happened to be both my last restaurant visited pre-quarantine and my first restaurant visited post-quarantine. Pre-quarantine: We didn't know dell'anima is located inside a food hall until we got there but nevertheless, it didn't feel like it when we were seated. I really enjoyed the Charred Octopus and the Carbonara. The waitstaff was very accommodating and we got about 2 bottles of wine. The fish was alright in my opinion but I actually enjoyed watching the cooks making it while we dined. Post-quarantine: They really are handling the post Covid work perfectly. They have limited food options and a nice little outdoor bar. We opted for glasses of prosecco and they were served in a to-go cup with a lid and a straw. They also have decent amounts of outdoor seating and standing space for you to socialize and drink."

Right now, they're gradually allowing customers to eat inside with reservations and temperature scans. However, the Gotham West Market (where they're located) has nice, airy outdoor eating areas. When it comes to the food, it's delicious. We got the bucatini alla arrabiata and the tagliolini Cacio e Pepe. Both were absolutely delightful. Beyond that, we also got the charred cauliflower and Brussels sprouts sides. The cauli was good, without a doubt. But those sprouts were quite possibly the best Brussels sprouts I have literally ever tasted. They've got cranberries and garlic and they're just amazing. A must try!"

1600,fahnqhxhFqyMAHKVC01sSA,8/28/2022,3 star rating,"It's a relaxing vibe at the South end of Gotham West (which is basically a glorified food court) at the counter of dell'anima, but the counter itself has a major design flaw: it's unbearably hot and moist at the corner of the bar near the boilers and ovens. It's so unbearable that everyone gathers at the other end, leaving half of the bar empty. The chef/cook also throws around empty pots and used pans with little regard for customers' experience or eardrums. Meanwhile, the cacio e pepe (Tagliolini) was over-salted to the point of making it barely edible (we're gonna need more water over here :-). The shrimp in the Linguini were unseasoned and bland, and the dish had no flavor of Calabrian chiles, which is what attracted me to the item on the menu. The arugula salad was dressed with a watery lemon juice, which offered no balance usually found in traditional preparations of the dish. We appreciated the freshly made pasta, which was cooked to a perfect tenderness. The wine list was solid and reasonably priced, and the 3-4 servers standing around behind the counter were very friendly and generous. The crowd tended young professionals or tourists who exited the Hudson Bike Path in No Man's land and wandered in. I won't make another trip over, but would try it again if I was nearby...but only if Corner Slice was closed and I couldn't get one of the best slices of pizza in NYC."

Sitting at the chefs table and watching the food being prepared was really fun. Also led to a bit of FOMO after we placed our order but will just need to visit again. We started with the Arancini and Bone marrow. Then had 2 of the pastas - bucatini and trofie. And finished with the chicken. Everything was great from start to finish. Can't wait to visit again!

We got the Burrata and I ordered the Carbonara. The Burrata was absolutely delicious. I wish other places served their Burrata on pesto. The Carbonara is made with fresh pasta and it's absolutely delicious. I think this might be one of the best carbonara dishes I have ever had.

The entire block has the parking lane set up with tables for outdoor dining. It took awhile to get the attention of staff to ask about how to order. We were told told find a table and someone would come help us. No one came to our table. After ~15 min we checked the menu online and I went back to the window to order. It was a rough start but by the time we were able to order and the food came out, then everything was upwards from there. We had table service and the food, especially the pastas, were excellent. I was very pleased and impressed with the taste and quality; and am curious what the regular menu looks like. I hope to visit the restaurant again when things are back to normal."

They don't take reservations, but we were a group of 4 and arrived just before noon and didn't have to wait.Their COVID setup is good. Jane street is closed to traffic between Hudson and 8th, so tables are well-spaced out in the street. Staff wore masks the entire time. They're using plastic cups for water and drinks which was fine for water, but I didn't love my champagne in the plastic cup.We each did the prix fixe brunch menu which gets you an entree plus a pastry basket (to share), coffee or tea, and a mimosa/bloody Mary/wine/beer.

If those two priorities are perfected, then the busboys are not essential, except for the amenities. Like water refills.So a diner orders over easy eggs with crisp bacon and very crisp French fries, mayo on the side--and because the wait person is conscientious, that person verifies that the above order, to a tee, is what the customer gets. It is NOT the busboy's responsibility. The main responsibility is for the chef to do exactly what's on the order, and then for the wait person to assure that what goes to her table isw hat was ordered, exactlyB--HOW NOT TO RUN A RESTAURANTWait person takes order. Order is given to the kitchen. Busboy brings to the dinerSo a diner orders over easy eggs with crisp bacon and very crisp French fries, mayo on the side But the bus person, totally in the dark about what was actually ordered, brings overcooked eggs and ""over-easy"", or limp, fatty bacon, with ketchup, not mayo, and home fries, not crisp French fries.How does this happen? Easy: primarily, blame the wait person for letting it happen--not the busboy; but the overall responsibility is with a chef or underling who does not understand the order, has a bad ""attitude"" or is overworked and is phoning it all inWhich boils down to MANAGEMENT. When a restaurant sinks into the latter state, it is because the owner or manger is NOT on the scene enough to control things--or to be wise enough to know when it's time to get employees more help"

Very classic, very laidback, sort of like a traditional NYC babr/restaurant. High wooden tables, and some white tablecloth tables. Long, dark bar with a glass backdrop.Decent beer menu. But it's the ambiance that did it. A perfectly chill spot for a lazy summer Sunday. And the music was great. Country when we walked in, but then strayed towards 70's funk, which was great hearing the bass through the low rumble of everyone speaking.And then one of the Managers chased after us to bring me my sunglasses (which I forgot).

We saw a mouse and asked to have our food to go. The older white woman who was serving us told us it was inevitable since they are ""required"" to keep the door open because of covid. Even after asking to have our food to go we also ordered deserts and the younger waiter when bringing them over said ""I hope you don't plan on taking the train"". The people next to us sat down after us and we're served and checked out way before us. There was tension being thrown at us from the beginning and us dining with mice inside of a restaurant is unheard of. In fact, we were sat down by the bartender who seemed to be the only other person of color in the restaurant. Our waiter and hostess walked by us and never even greeted us. Capacity was 25%.

1617,lxQ-tzFmL1tmUqZUN-CSRQ,10/16/2021,5 star rating,"Excellent bakery that is dangerously close to my apartment. This bakery is impressive because it excels at both fancy, high-production items (rose-pistachio croissant) and core bakery competencies like the humble baguette. Of note is their ricotta-cheescake-pie situation. I can't remember exactly what they call it, but you get the jist. A few other places in the city, like Veniero's do this style of cheesecake well, but Partybus's version is the best. It has a nice ratio of crust to filling (not a thick glut of filling like a lot of places do), a fabulous delicate texture, delicious ricotta flavor, a touch of caramelization on the top and a bright hint of lemon on the finish. Â In my opinion this is the sleeper hit of their sweet items - a highly considered desert-snack that's extremely well refined in both texture and taste. I love that it's a dish that comes without all the bells and whistles of fancy-pants deserts. Its humble pie format only adds to the charm. Â Truly a 10 out of 10 item. The other item here that I love is their classic baguette. Yes, they do all their breads well, but their baguette is without doubt the best in the neighborhood. The crumb structure is excellent - very airy, a lot of holes with a great variety of sizes, nice balance of chewy-to-melt-in-your mouth. The crust is very crispy and crackly, not hard and hazardous to the roof of your mouth if you plan to use the baguette in a sandwich application. The taste is also of high quality and the dough is nicely seasoned with salt. This is a dream baguette for sandwiches, but honestly most of the time I end up eating it plain. That is how good it is. Another big plus about this bakery is that they sell all their breads in 1/2 and sometimes 1/4 loafs. I love this flexibility for people like me who sometimes intake their carbs alone.I don't want to throw shade by naming bakery names, but the other baguettes in the neighborhood all fall short in either being overly salted, or having poor flavor development, tough crumb structures, or having crusts that are beyond hard and will cut your mouth up. Skip all these other sad baguette experiences and go to Partybus! Some of their other pastry case items are not for me, but I think this is a matter of personal taste. For example, I wanted the scallion bun to have more scallion flavor and be less rich. The bun is brioche-y and in my opinion the dough is overly enriched. However, to Partybus's credit, you can taste that they are using quality ingredients for the enriching!"

They've not only offered delivery of their bakery items but also sell all sorts of pantry items too (at reasonable prices)! There's been so many yeast and flour shortages at local grocery stores but Partybus always keeps stocked! They were even giving out free gloves with orders (don't know if they still do that now). Jacqueline (the owner? head baker?) is super nice, very responsive on both email and instagram message. She answered my questions about ingredients (food sensitivity reasons) and even delivered more fresh yeast free of charge SAME DAY when I worried that my fresh yeast was dead (it was actually fine, just slower than instant yeast - if you're reading this I'm sorry you had to come all this way).We got our sourdough starter here and it's totally thriving in our fridge. Every order we get is so yummy! I love the L.E.S. sourdough loaf (better than anything I could make on my own), the GF brownies are perfectly rich and moist, the chai spice cookies are so flavorful. The scallion buns-wow such fluffy savory goodness. I got a cake also for a quarantine birthday and birthday boy loved it! I always get a mystery loaf with every order too and it's such a good deal! Different thing every time - it truly is a mystery.I can't wait to come here in person when I feel safe to take the subways again."

Duff's although not being the typical bar I would go to being mostly heavy metal based, was actually a cool little bar in the Marcy area of Brooklyn. Inexpensive drinks and a cool crowd, Duff's was a dope go to on a Friday night. They have a small lounge seating area in the back of the bar if you attend here with a group of friends. You may miss the bar at first being that it isn't openly visible at first. It is more of a downstairs in a building on a block on Marcy which kind of fits the atmosphere of the area and bar itself. If you're into heavy metal and live in or close to the area, Duff's a bar for you."

I feared having to use it for #2 as you most likely can't visualize a clean wipe. Bartender and staff were all awesome, drinks were cheap and there's cheap pizza right around the corner.

The drinks are fairly cheap. I have had nights where I've only spent about 20 bucks and had a decent amount of drinks. They aren't watered down either. I must say, this place is amazing.

Plenty of seating and comfortable big booth. Appetizers were good. My favorite were the lamb sliders. Really tender and juicy. The shrimp rossioto was OK. Shawarma lamb platter was good but meat was a bit dry, I think if it was shawarma wrap that would've been better. For desserts we got the chocolate lava cake and mango cake both were amaaaazing! Hooka price is high but so are all hooka places in manhattan. All of us were able to find street parking. Overall great experience, good food and good service."

I went to this hole in the wall on Thursday during the early evening with my friend and at the door the host tells us there is a time limit of one hour. My friend and I look at each other like huh? Confused as the restaurant was completely empty lol there were literally 3 people in the entire establishment. We expressed to this nasty hostess that we were just having drinks and weren't staying long. As we are taken to our table no one brought us water. The entire night the waitress who is also the host didn't even ask us if we would like water and when we requested water she gave us HOT water. Unbelievable. The drinks are $17 and they are gross! Â I ordered a spicy margarita and got crap in a cup. I sent it back and the bartender and host both start gossiping and complaining about us and the other 3 patrons. This place doesn't even deserve one star. Their staff is rude, unprofessional, unfriendly, drinks are awful, ambiance is wack. Will not be returning to this dump. Â The Best part was when She gave us our check! she was clever enough to add her own tip on our bill. Unbelievable. â"

Tables were slanted and on uneven pavement, I would've appreciated maybe for them to have evened it out. Table right behind us were also complaining about their drinks that kept spilling and sitting next to the garbage. No music and all you have is the next tables conversation and traffic noise to accompany you.Drinks were average and we were told you must order food as well. I ordered the grilled chicken wings and they were really good. The gardenia hookah flavor was very good as well. If I happen to ever come back I will make a reservation for the inside or the covered sidewalk seating."

Nicely flavoured and charcoals get changed regularly.Servers are Nice and Friendly.Make sure you carry vaccination status / proof with you.Make sure you reserve on peak hours at least!Try their Chicken Shawarma Wrap or Platter.

They checked the flood under us but no one told us to switch seats until 30min later. We were mostly eating w bathroom smell and disgusting toilet water. Also, we had to pee at the Mexican restaurant that was on the other side which there is only one bathroom and has a wait. A the end, we ask for discount but they only give us cheap lemon shot and that was it. Could done much better to move away people sit close to bathrooms and better service. There is also a 20% tips included the bill."

We ordered a bunch of plates to share:Feta sampler was nice and salty, I enjoyed the one with kalamata olives a lot and the red pepper one was something you don't see every day. The apps all came with these delicious (probably flash fried?) pita triangles which were very flavorful, with bits of rosemary. The hummus was nothing to write home about but still good. Felafel was a little over cooked but that meant it was super crispy which isn't a bad thing. The chicken schwarma wrap was pretty substantive in terms of the amount of meat they give you. I felt like there could have been some more garlic or lemon in the tahini sauce but still, very enjoyable. Surprisingly the barbecue -esque flavoring of the fries was my favorite part of the whole meal, that seasoning was so addictive! So, long story short: I'd you're looking to go to a hookah lounge and bar but want to bring hungry folks or people who don't want hookah, there will be food options for them!"

I've never had momos or this type of cuisine was a must for me. They do a lot of fusion dishes here which I thought was cool and then dishes more on the traditional side.Momos are just a type of dumpling. They get served with a cooler sauce that the dumplings are sitting in. They are light and delicate and the skin was super thin and a generous amount of filling was inside. The coated masala wings had a nice tomato spice to it, without being overpowering and a dynamite crunch with every bite. The Naan was fresh, light with a good char flavor. Every dish came out super fast here and was executed perfectly. The staff was super nice and gave great explanations of each dish that we had gotten if we were confused on what we were ordering. Love this place and it was a great introduction to Nepal food."

The Chicken Jhol Momo was pleasant but a bit doughy. It needed more broth / basting juices inside, however very tasty given its seasoning and sauce. My main dish the chicken platter was very tasty. I wanted actual rice versus the puff rice but they told me they did not have that an an alternative option (surprised me a bit) what Asian influenced restaurant doesn't have rice? The chicken was flavorful with its unique spices. The chicken choila is served COLD! Wasn't my favorite and almost had a slightly spoiled taste. The puff rice just didn't seem to belong on the platter. All in all it was overall a good in house, dining experience. I wasn't pleased to know they take CASH only but thankfully I had enough. They do have an ATM in the back and outdoor seating."

Split 5-6 items among a group of 4 and it was definitely too much food but worth it try a lot. The momos were definitely the table favorite. The Veg Jhol has such a light fresh filling; perfect to dunk into the spicy soupy goodness. Also really enjoyed the Chana (chickpeas) entree with all the fixings and the meat eaters raves about the spicy masala wings. Overall, great place to come with a group of people to try the most and be ready to leave 10 pounds heavier and happier."

I had a Pilsner from Braven.For starters, we shared the Kathmandu Poppers and the vegetarian momo. The popper was a long green pepper stuffed with potato and cheese. The top of the pepper where most of the seeds lay was quiet spicy but the bottom was mild. We enjoyed the momo too. It was served in a light sauce. For the main course, we shared the sizzling salmon and the aloo gabi paratha. I thought the paratha platter was more interesting as it came with four sides so you got to try more."

There's no shortage of Nepali options all along Roosevelt Avenue but this place is perfect if you want an abundance of traditional and fusion options in a superb setting.I first visited While In Kathmandu during the pandemic on the first day they opened their backyard. I was so full of joy to be enjoying a meal outside in a quaint setting with friends that I could have been served 3 day old food and I would have been satisfied (fortunately the food here is exceptional and fresh)!The interior is cozy and intimate but the backyard has evolved and definitely the place if you want a perfect dining experience. I love the backyard setup and it's nice to be around such a fun energy that is usually present. The food here is perfect for sharing and the masala wings, fries, jhol momos, and cheese naan are some of the starters I would recommend (and may be more than enough food for a group of 2-3 people). There are several entrees also with trying that give diners a wonderful sense of traditional Nepali cuisine.I love this place for dates or meetups with friends and even tea or drinks can lead to an awesome time.

I didn't come during happy hour (though I hear the deals are great), but wanted to get a nice bottle anyway for a celebration.The bar is circular with some seats against the walls, which is where we sat. When I came, on a Thursday night, the place was quite crowded and it was a little difficult to hear my friend talk. That is my only complaint though. Next time around I'd come a bit earlier so I could hold a conversation a bit better.The ambiance here is great. The lighting is dim and it is a great place for either a date or a girls night out. The wine list was pretty extensive. It was a bit pricier than I'd expect some of the bottles to be, but definitely worth it. No matter what you are looking for, you can find it here.I wanted to try something funky and different and settled on an amphora aged Granacha. No regrets, the wine was fantastic and I'll definitely make an effort to come back here again."

The bartenders and servers are really nice and knowledgeable. Their outdoor seating is well-spaced with dividers between tables, and you probably have better luck getting a table now than before the pandemic (due to more tables).

There's 3 wine options for HH - one red, one white and one rose. I opted for the rose - the bartender comes and lets everyone try their wines first before he pours you your full glass, which is pretty generous. We opted to split their 3 cheeses and 3 meats, which came with bread and mustard. I quite liked the combo - there was, however, more cheese + meat than bread so we ended up just nibbling on cheese/meats at the end. Prices were reasonable and service was attentive enough. If I'm in the area again looking for HH, I wouldn't hesitate to stop by in Lelabar again."

I couldn't even have a conversation with my friend. We hurried up and ate/drank and left as soon as possible with ringing ears! I would NOT come back. Overall rating: B-My friend and I came here on Wednesday around 6:30pm. It was packed but we got 2 seats together (2 women moved down a seat to help accommodate us). I had a Groupon for $60 worth of wine and tapas for two. Happy hour seems popular here. They have an oval shaped bar with only tall backless bar seats, which are super uncomfortable. At least they have coat hooks under the bar. What we tried:We got 3 for $18 cheese, served with grainy mustard, quince paste, and fresh crusty bread (not $16 as listed online): -PYRENEES BREBIS-FRANCE (Raw Sheep's milk- Firm, dense, smooth with grassy and sweet caramel notes.): Nice fresh spreadable cheese. A-NOCCIOLA cheese: Great, firm cheese. A-Third unknown firm cheese: Can't remember the name and it's not listed on the website, but very tasty. AWe got 3 for $18 cheese, served with cornichons and fresh crusty bread (not $16 as listed online): -KULEN (Rustic salami with red paprika): Large slices with nice spice and flavor. My favorite of the meats. A+-BEEF LOIN (Air dried smoked beef tenderloin): Interesting jerky like taste. Salty. Not sure I'd get this again. B-ISTRIANKA SALAMI (Harder salami, made with red wine, garlic and whole black peppercorn): Nice and flavorful! A-Sangiovese red wine: Too sweet. My friend and I were not fans of this wine. Though they do let you have a taste before you order a full glass of wine. B--Aval Cidre Artisinal, from Bretagne, France in a bottle: Served with a glass. I thought it was pretty funky. Not sweet. It's definitely different than American style ciders. Tastes better with food than on its own. B"

Â Here is what we noticed:- We were meeting him at 6:15pm on a Friday evening...there were going to be three of us, and because we got there a bit early we were able to quickly snag a couple of chairs at a little ledge in the area behind the bar. Â Be warned, at that time/day, it's pretty hard to find seats anywhere...either at the bar or one of the few tables they have. Â In any event, a bar stool opened up shortly thereafter and we were able to move it to create a little seating group for the three of us.- Because service is at the bar only, we had to order food/drinks there...no problem whatsoever, and the bartenders were really helpful. Â - Others have mentioned the Happy Hour...it includes various wines, including some by the glass and some bottles too. Â We tried one of the Reds, and then ordered a bottle to share (which became two bottles a short while later...at exactly two minutes before the Happy Hour was to end). Â The bottles were very reasonable at $28 each.- We also got a cheese plate...I really liked the fact that we could pick the specific items on the plate from a variety of options.- Atmosphere was really comfy and relaxing.Bottom line: Â Great find.

They have outdoor dining set up in the back with comfy seats and a large tent to keep it cool for the summer. There were actually a good amount of tables and not many people dining there so there were plenty of space between customers. The service was also great. Everything came out fairly quick and there was only one waitress at the time I dined in but she really on top of everything.The food was certainly delicious. I ordered the authentic Greek salad, fried kalamari, the spanakopita (spinach pie), and the mixed grill platter for 2.The Greek salad was very simple - it only had tomatoes, cucumbers, sliced onions, olives, and a chunk of feta cheese on top, all drizzled in olive oil. The tomatoes were super juicy and the salad was really refreshing, pairing well with the meat platter.The fried kalamari were big chunks of calamari and had a thin coating on the outside, which was crispy. It came with marinara sauce that wasn't thick enough in my opinion but still a tasty appetizer.The spanakopita, which is spinach pie, was bigger than I expected. It was flavorful but the crust wasn't crispy enough. It was packed with filling too.The mixed grill platter for 2 can definitely fill more than 2 people, especially if you want to order appetizers. It came with pork and chicken kalamaki (skewers), beef & chicken bifteki (patties), pork gyro, beef & lamb gyro, and rotisserie chicken. Everything was super flavorful. The biftekis were very juicy, and the gyros had a nice char on the outside which kept it a bit crispy but still tender. It also came with pita bread and choice of lemon potatoes, rice, or fries. Their fries were thin but very crispy.Overall, a yummy Greek spot to check out! The food was very flavorful and will definitely fill you up. The service was also great."

They were extremely professional and I was very impressed with their customer service. While I cannot review their food until the next time I'm in NY, my family member said it was very tasty and satisfying!"
1673,v2dtG37r1ThqtfEfiFsAUg,10/7/2021,3 star rating,High prices. Chicken souvlaki was really good. Very small though. The pita sandwiches are all mini but okay. The gyro meat was dry and not great especially for 6.50 each! Â Just get the fries! Â They were worth it
1674,v2dtG37r1ThqtfEfiFsAUg,1/29/2020,5 star rating,"Hands down the best and most authentic Greek food around. Their beef and lamb gyro sandwich is incredible, the meat is so tasty. Their pork stick which came with a lemon wedge and some of the best pita slices I've ever had. They had amazing seasoning and olive oil drizzled on top. Onto the desert, I got both the apple yogurt and the clementine yogurts, they were both the best yogurt I've had in my life honestly. The honey and apple crumbs on top and coconut were simply phenomenal. Can't wait to come back.Check out Kalamaki in Flushing on Francis Lewis Blvd for some real authentic Greek food. Â This was one of the best meals of my life: Mixed grill platter for 2 and includes Pork & Chicken Kalamaki, Beef & Chicken Bifteki, Rotisserie Chicken, Pork Gyro, Beef & Lamb Gyro served with Pita Bread, Lemon Potatoes and Tzatziki. @kalamakigr #greek #greekfood #authentic #food #instafood"

Time was running late, so I chose a spot close to home with decent ratings, little to no wait and allowed indoor dining. Then I came upon Kalamaki GR. At first glance of the store, it didn't seem very popular or fancy. Just a decently small store with only a couple people inside. But boy, did we all judge a book by its cover...FOODMIXED GRILL MEAT PLATTER - Since we are a family of 4, it was recommended by the server and I decided that we opt for the family style mixed grill platter. Although it says that it is for 2 people, it definitely more than enough for a family of 4 to be honest.- It has such a variety of meats. It was great to try a little bit of everything and share. My personal favorites were the gyro meat and the pork kalamaki. We all had our full share of meats and we all agreed that it was such a great deal. We were pleasantly surprised.- It also comes with pita bread and we opted for rice as the side. I'm glad we chose rice because the potatoes or french fries would have been way too oily and filling, so the rice was perfect.FAMILY STYLE AUTHENTIC GREEK SALAD- We also opted for a greek salad to balance out all that meat. It was a big hit because the meat can get a little heavy and the salad was a great compliment.- Those came with pitas and sauce, which was also delicious. Overall, we were pleasantly surprised by our very first visit. Sharing all the food and getting our fill for a decent price, we were very happy. I'm glad that I decided to check out this place. The street food seems pretty authentic & good, servers were very attentive/great, seating was very spaced out. I was very impressed in a good way."

Oh no someone brushed you with their elbow, that does sound like something a weirdo would do...Anderson I hope you find feces in your next order of whatever it is you're about to eat and then say a bunch of critical things about online. I hope you find the feces after you've eaten about 3/4 of it. Then I can't wait to hear your hyper critical review of the nurses that have to put up with you as they pump your stomach.

The bartender I was talking to (Patrick) was very friendly and I even spoke to him about maybe running some scrimmage games in the future with his bar sponsored softball team. Even after some people got too twisted after the night was over (Won't name any names), he offered some glasses of free ginger ale to help her.. or him feel better lol There were also plenty of beers on tap that I would like to come back and try.

I decided to come to this location because it was closer to where I was running my errands. I loved the other location and had a great dining experience. When I got my cup I noticed it had a fine layer of black residue and I tried to wipe it off. It came off but then I noticed the entire cup was covered in it! That turned off my appetite. However; when the food came my appetite returned and the pizza I ordered (a la vodka) and the baked clams were very delicious. I couldn't finish the pizza because it was overloaded with toppings and I ordered the square (6 pieces). The baked clams were seasoned well and I definitely need to learn how to make my own!

Tall guy using bandana mask took our order and said it would be ready in 20 minutes....We waited outside and went back in 20 minutes where our order wasnt even placed in the oven yet. I said you said 20 minutes 20 minutes ago. He said YOU WERE NOT IN HERE 20 MINUTES AGO. I said we were and he checked the time and realized we were. Instead of apologizing and saying that they were busy, he went off on how busy he was repeatedly. I then asked who the owner was where he told me to FIGURE IT OUT and then said IM THE BOSS. I told him he wasnt and asked for my money back. HE INITIALLY SAID NO to my request! So I said it until he did give me my money back. This guy has no business dealing with the public, and I WILL FIND OUT WHO THE OWNER IS.

The mobile app and self ordering kiosk is easy to use. This Wendy's always seems to be busy which is a good sign however on more than one occasion the workers seem to be standing around, clueless as to what to do or how to move fast."

That said, this particular location is as good as you can expect a Wendy's to be, i.e. not that great. Although the Limeade and chicken nuggets were satisfying, I left with a bad taste in my mouth after an encounter with one of the workers there who, instead of calling me by the name that was on my debit card-and clearly printed out-asked for ""Gerardo."" I know that is the Spanish transliteration of my name, but this is not a Spanish-speaking country. And even if it were, I would expect the workers there to use the name that is on my birth certificate and all of my public documents, regardless of convenience/familiarity. Just as if I were named ""Gerardo"" I would expect them to use that name when delivering my order."

1703,3KlWyCJ2BikxwcEb0-O4Ww,1/24/2019,4 star rating,"I have been periodically visiting this Wendy's during lunch for the past four months, generally once a week. Â The food is what you would expect (fries are fresh during lunchtime because of the turnover), but this Wendy's is notable because of the speed of its staff. Â The store used to display some kind of Wendy's service award that it won in years past, and I would say it was well deserved. Â  *Order Time/ProcessI generally visit at 11:00AM-12:00PM, and am out of the store in about 10 minutes. Â There are also a number of tablet kiosks available to take orders (and swipe credit cards) for those who want to use them. If you place your order with a cashier, you will be given a number that will be displayed on an overhead order status screen. If you place your order with a tablet, your name will appear on the status screen. The overhead screen does not do much more than confirm that your order was received, however, because the workers generally call out your name or number as they prepare your food. Because of the cramped space, people generally crowd around the counter area, which unfortunately also happens to be in front of the bathroom (but it seems to be low-traffic or locked). *CrowdsThere is a school nearby so if you visit at 11:40AM there will be a huge line of kids trying to order from the cashiers (The kids must get their lunch break around 11:30AM). Â The tablet line will generally allow you to order immediately though (assuming you have a credit card), and was never more than 1 person deep per tablet (even at 12:00PM). *Eat-in FacilitiesFor those who want to eat at the location, the size of the lunch crowd and the cramped space make it a bad choice. Â The storefront is also currently under scaffolding, so I would not recommend visiting if you intend to eat on-site. There is a windowless basement area as well, but it seems to be under perpetual renovation. So even if you do manage to find seating, you will be constantly brushed by customers entering and leaving the store. *MiscIn terms of service, there was one time when a worker forgot to include a sandwich I ordered, but it only happened once during the past four months. I would generally rate the place as an above-average Wendy's that is good for a quick to-go order."

They are very adequately staffed and I must point out that they always have some one cleaning up and making sure things are tidy. Also, they have never messed up one of my orders !

1747,6LfskUyZzmcDSV6h5kOwGw,10/14/2018,1 star rating,"Honestly the worst chipotle I have ever gone to. The staff were not friendly at all and the amount of food they served me was ridiculous. Below I posted a picture of my food just after 3 bites, and everyone who is a chipotle fan knows that they aren't exactly the cheapest. Every other chipotle I have gone to makes sure to pack the bowl up. I am highly disappointed."
1748,6LfskUyZzmcDSV6h5kOwGw,6/22/2018,3 star rating,"This Chipotle location is convenient for me, so I come here once in a while. It's definitely not the most efficient location, though. I can't tell you how many times I've gone here during lunch and they have run out of a basic ingredient like chicken or brown rice. There's almost always a long line, which is expected in midtown, but the employees that they have working at the register definitely slow everything down. The other day I handed the employee cash...she got distracted by something...and then tried to tell me that I didn't pay. Another employee had to show her that I had already paid and was waiting for my change. Overall, if you're in a hurry or want a seamless experience, this isn't the Chipotle location to visit. Still, it's a pretty large location so it is nice that you can almost always find a seat."

I didn't even point to anything I wanted yet because I was waiting for them to be finished with whatever conversation they were having amongst themselves. Then one girl finally begins to pay attention and just starts putting tomatoes on one of my bowls. She then didn't proceed to get me a new bowl but rather SCOOP THEM OUT with a freaking cup. Im not allergic to tomatoes but I highly despise them. It literally ruins the whole feel. Like dead ass who the hell does that? Just make a whole new bowl.

The line wasn't that long, it was just very slow-moving. I ordered a chicken burrito, but they said there were preparing the chicken in the kitchen and said it would be a couple of minutes. I ended up waiting about 20 minutes for the new batch of chicken to arrive."
1753,6LfskUyZzmcDSV6h5kOwGw,7/6/2016,3 star rating,"Located at the foot of the Empire State Building, this Chipotle is much more busier compared to the other Chipotle's that I've been to. This place attracts tourist, regulars and ticket sellers alike. I decided to stop by here during my lunch break and take advantage of my rewards card and claim my free offer for chips and guac. While waiting on line, I noticed that they're now offering chorizos, and I had to try it! I ordered a burrito bowl with a wrap on the side with everything and guac. The cashier had difficulty processing my order so one of his coworkers had to help him. Other than that, the service was superb. After being Asian to the 10th power, I grabbed a stack of napkins so I can save them for future use at home lol. The chorizo bowl itself was surprisingly good. The taste resembled somewhat of a spicy steak flavor. Unfortunately, I had to run to the bathroom several times after my meal. Food was good m, but I feel like they could've paid more attention to the cleanliness and the sanitary conditions of the restaurant."

I mean I'm spending $15.00 for a bowl at least there should be enough rice! I shouldn't have to ask if I can have more rice. I won't go again, they need to get rid of her!"
1755,6LfskUyZzmcDSV6h5kOwGw,9/30/2015,5 star rating,"Yes! Finally, those tasty big-ass burritos at Chipotle! We went here right after the visit of the Empire State Building, right at the corner. You walk in and order up front and make your picks. So I opted for a chicken burrito with brown cilantro-lemon rice, black and pinto beans, tomatoes, sour cream, cheese and some lettuce. I also got mine pretty hot as I added salsa to it. The guys were quite generous cause normally you can either sour cream or cheese, pinto or black beans but we got a bit of everything! Niiiiiice! We also added a regular soda and yes, they serve it PIBB XTRA which you do not find frequently anymore. For this we paid 11 bucks including tax. Quite okay for this fat-ass and very tasty burrito! The personnel was very friendly and the place kinda comfortable - I mean we are talking fast food restaurant - so they are mostly not very comfy!"

There's a pretty decent selection of flavors. I had a regular slice and a Hawaiian slice - i had to get it. The Hawaiian slice was as it should be -sweet pineapple and salty ham! Plenty of seating inside, the regular slice bought me back to when i was a kid. Not all pizza is created equal. Guys stop reviewing based on factors the place cannot control like PARKING.

The owner is so kind and friendly, and sometimes if you come in near closing and there are still unsold baked goods they'll just give them to you for free! The space itself is pretty cramped - the lids/sugar are hard to get to as you have to pass some tables through a narrow space, and the line at the counter can get chaotic, but it's an excellent spot to get coffee to go. Kuro Kuma made me a fan of counter culture, not the other way around. (And it almost made me a fan of Balthazar.)Some super minor things that I find really cute:-the miniature black bears on the counter-the cups stamped with ""Kuro Kuma""; the color and placement of the stamps vary-artwork from different local artists featured on the walls"

Pair that with one of their Balthazar Bakery pastries (the chocolate croissant and scones are HEAVEN) and there you have it, your perfect breakfast! Keep in mind that the cafe itself is TINY. There are only ~8 seats inside, so be prepared to wait if you wanna stay. It's also close to Columbia and MSM so there's sometimes people working on their laptops or studying when they clearly don't have a drink or pastry with them.. Kinda annoying but can't be helped I guess.It can get pretty busy in the morning with the line sometimes going out the door, but the satisfying caffeine fix is something I really don't mind lining up for at all! Must try!"

Based off reviews, I thought the place was going to blow me away. I will have to say the coffee was strong but it was just good. The size of the place is tiny. There's not much space inside to sit and enjoy your coffee. Also, the staff wasn't as nice as other reviews mentioned. I hope that was just an off day for them. I would definitely go back because there coffee is good and very close to campus."

The sushi in general was subpar - I would say the salmon was fresher than the tuna. I honestly would have rather went to Whole Foods and picked up pre-made sushi. The spicy edamame was not spicy at all; it actually tasted like it had marinara sauce on it LOL. Also, it wasn't cooked the full was through. Finally, the crispy rice wasn't even crispy. It tasted gummy and stale. I give the presentation and delivery time an A+, but that's about it. Everyone raves about this place and I am not jumping on that bandwagon anytime soon."

However, it is quite pricey, and I'm not sure I'm all that satisfied even after eating 5 rolls, which already ran me quite a bit on budget.Everything is just ok, in terms of rice and fish. Rolls have the benefit where you don't need to put in huge pieces of fish, and I didn't feel like I was eating spectacular fish or wagyu for example.The sushi counter is a plus to be able to sit, but again, just felt like I wasn't getting my money's worth for what I was eating."

So I decided to give Bondi a try and boy am I glad I did. What reeled me in was their lunch menu special I got the middle option which included 1 appetizer, 2 nigiri (2 sets of 2), and 2 hand rolls for $26. Service: was exceptional, the lady at the front greeted me and sat me at the bar sushi bar table. There's about 20 seats inside. She gave me a wet towel to wash my hands and kept checking on me to make sure everything was good. The sushi masters behind the bar took great care into their sushi craft. Experience: it was cool to see the sushi masters at work behind the bar area. Everything is super fresh, the lady in the back was making the sushi rice Â laying the hot rice on onto the giant bamboo Â tray and using a paddle to cool it down. Appetizer: Jalapeno yellowtailSo rich and buttery with the perfect amount of heat from the sliver of jalapeno. Nigiri:O Toro and Seared Kobe Kobe was seared and baked in my mouth Â so buttery and flavorful, it was intense beef flavor. Tuna was yummy as well, everything tasted so freshHand rolls: Hot and Spicy blue crab Â and Toro scallion: Was spicy and so dahm good (my favorite)Toro: was delicious but simple I definitely recommend giving this place a try"

Beautifully packaged with a portioned ginger, wasabi and soy sauce, this sushi box makes my eyes and mouth so happy. For $23, I built my own box and chose Yellowtail Scallion, Â salmon avocado, spicy salmon, and spicy blue crab. My favorite by far was the yellowtail, which was melt in your mouth! I usually don't love yellowtail but thoroughly enjoyed this. Both the salmon rolls were packed with fresh fish, and delicious.The spicy blue crab was sadly underwhelming for me. It was missing something, like a zest or the actual crab taste. The rolls itself were poorly rolled / cut and were falling apart a bit. Overall I'd have it again but small details count! Note for takeaway, there is a separate entrance."

Juicy Cube was on the way to an appointment name to t so stopped in and purchased the detox juice and a shot of ginger. The ginger shot was made fresh and served in a shot glass...she said just take it to the head so I did! Â It was a little spicy but nothing too bad. The detox has a nice little spice aftertaste from the ginger and the celery covers up the carrots. I would definitely go back because I want to try the watermelon lemonade refresher.

I was working a few blocks away, and I love bubble tea, so I was stoked to find Juicy Cube. I ordered a large strawberry black tea with boba. There were so many bobas! The portion was really generous, that I ended up wishing I had more tea. I also ordered the berry acai bowl. It came with oats, peanut butter, and bananas. The acai was more of a smoothie consistency. It's not what I'm used to, but nevertheless, the flavors were good and the bowl was filling. There isn't really a place to sit and enjoy your meal, however I was grabbing it to go, so it didn't really matter. The store itself is light and filled with fruit. If you're looking for a fresh juice or fruit smoothie this is definitely your place."

I was excited to swing by to grab an acai bowl for breakfast/lunch but wasn't too impressed by it.***LOCATION & INTERIOR**Juicy Cube by the corner of 56th & Lex, right next to the newly opened KBBQ by Korilla (yesss, more casual Asian eats please). The inside is relatively spacious given the area, with a small area to sit against one wall. The right wall is taken up by three fridges stocked with vegan Asian food (noodles, dumplings, etc.), wheatgrass and ginger shots ($2.75 each but they're supposed to be great for you??), chia pudding, oatmeal, and young coconuts. The counters are equally packed with goods, ranging from snacks to energy/protein bars, tea, and dried fruit and nuts. I'm impressed with their collection of healthy products.It was really crowded when I stopped by at peak weekday lunch hour, but there were a lot of workers behind the counter speedily blending away.***FOOD***I ordered the berry acai bowl, no peanut butter mixed in for ~$8 after tax. Really reasonable price considering that 1) it's an acai bowl and 2) it's midtown. My order was ready in under 10min.My first thought was oh this bowl is smaller than expected, but it was heavy (i.e., filled most of the way with the acai mix) and ended up being pretty filling. On top was crunchy granola, which I really liked, and a spoonful of smooth peanut butter. The acai mix was slightly sweet and fruity, but wasn't that flavorful...worse, it was lukewarm! Instead of being cold and refreshing like a normal smoothie bowl, it was literally room temperature. I finished the whole thing, but only because I added some of my own chilled strawberries to mix in with the granola.Maybe I just came at a bad time since they were speeding through orders?***NOTES/RECOMMENDATION***Juicy Cube has so much potential because they just have so much...stuff. Food, drinks, snacks, they have it all. Although my order was disappointing this time, I'll still go back since it's acai bowls are the cheapest near my office and have potential to be good...better luck next time?"

One excuse after another meanwhile my son has no criminal record drug free disease free no reason to not hire him. So she the manager a young white ladyComes back doesn't call my son so I call her at mcdonalds and she snaps at me for calling to find out why they have given him a chance for employment.

The girl on the other end repeated my order to me correctly. The girl at next window asked to verify my order to pay for it, I repeated my aforementioned order and handed my debit card to her, I paid the sum of $11.97. At the next window the girl there tried to hand me a medium drink and medium fry. I explained that I ordered a large and I confirmed it prior. She told me that I was only charged for the medium and not the large, I nicely asked her to correct the size to which she became flustered. I handed my debit card towards her, she declined me and demanded I pay cash for the upgrade. I told her I don't carry cash so she huffed and talked to the manager. She came back to the window and demanded my card. She then told me I had to pull forward while they were in possession of my debit card and they would bring it out to me. ABSOLUTELY NOT APPROPRIATE! I refused and she demanded me to pull forward again. I again said absolutely not, why so she could copy my card and/or steal my info. She rolled her eyes and told her manager I refused to move until I had my card. I was returned my card and I drove away. At no time did this ""manager"" address me personally or try to personally rectify the situation. This isn't the first time my wife & I have had problems here it it is certainly the last time we will ever purchase anything from this establishment. Perhaps they need to be retrained in customer satisfaction/service. They are constantly messing orders up and are very rude to customers.

1866,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,9/15/2016,5 star rating,"First, let me be clear that this is not s five-star hotel in the traditional sense. This hotel receives 5 stars because it hits the sweet spot for piece and quality in NYC. First of all, the LIC is clean. Wooden floors, new furnishings, pristine bedding and towels--all make you feel as though you should be paying much more than you are. The rooms are small, of course, but not oppressively so. I can walk around by king size bed, use the toilet without my knees touching the wall, and tuck my suitcase into the corner out of the way. There's a free hot breakfast, with eggs, bacon, sausage, and all the cereals and breads you would expect. No princely, but better than you would expect. The location is not great, being in LIC, but the subway is steps away. There are 4-star cafes and restaurants, and a Dunk and bodegas all Â within walking distance. Unless you really want to be right in the center of it all--and pay for that!--I can't imagine a better place to stay in NYC."
1867,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,10/13/2018,3 star rating,"So there are a few pros and cons of this hotel. Pros: breakfast, and very clean (super important to me)Cons: not near any bars/restaurants for easy access and hotel does not have food or drink either.

1868,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,12/25/2016,5 star rating,"I know I live in NY but I stayed here two nights, who said you can't be a tourist in your own city. We arrived and parking could be a bit tricky since this is sort of an industrial area but if you go to the back streets many don't have any street signs so that means no alternative side parking or restrictions on when you can park. I was really impressed by how clean the lobby was and how nice everyone that works at this hotel is. We were created very warm and were even given our room a bit earlier than check in time. We didn't have a great view but that didn't matter to me. Our room was on the second floor and the room was clean, modern and had everything you could need including a mini fridge. The bathroom was plain but I really enjoyed the complimentary toiletries since you could tell they were good quality. I took advantage of the hot breakfast which consisted of eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns,Cereal, bagels and toast. I really like this location there isn't much to do here but the train is only two blocks away and you will be in midtown in 10 minutes."
1869,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,4/30/2016,5 star rating,I and my hubby stayed here for one night in long island city . It was my russian orthodox Easter. The price for a one night stay is really good . The people working at the front desk is really professional and are really helpful and nice . They have private parking which is 20$ a night which isnt bad at all . The rooms are nothing spectacular but at least they are really clean and a nice size room . We got a king size bed and it was really comfortable. I booked two weeks ahead of time to get a really good deal of 115$ a night on expedia . I would suggest to try and it out and see what you think of it .

At checkin the front desk clerk told us our reservation never existed even though we were assigned a room number and had a confirmation code and email. Later we found out the manager cancelled it without reason and told us the hotel was fully booked and there was nothing he could do. The front desk clerk was super super rude and unsympathetic.

And I'm really glad we did! The hotel was great. PROS: Friendly service, breakfast and wifi included, brand new, clean new comfortable rooms, awesome toiletries, a 2 minute walk to the subway station, and a 10-15 minute subway ride into midtown Manhattan. The area is safe and we had no problem coming home from Manhattan even late at night. Rooftop access gives you nice views of the manhattan skyline. The area is great in the sense that it is away from noise of manhattan, assuring you a good night sleep. CONS: can not really think of any. Of the 3 nights we stayed here, we had an issue with the Wifi going out for like half hour, one night. Asked the hotel staff about it, and they had the issue resolved in about half hour. So technically, no Cons really. My main concerns when booking hotels is: price, safety and cleanliness. I would give 5 stars for all of these concerns and will definitely be recommending this hotel!"

Kinda messy to eat, but yummy.Because I found it kinda awkward to eat, it sort of negates one of the key benefits of a taco. I love this concept, but would be cool to see more mini versions (maybe inspired by bao, or sliders) so you get the benefit of delicious Indian curry and naan as well as the convenience of eating.If I were in my 20s and going out to bars until the early hours I think this would be a great spot to stop on the way home."

It has a oh so subtle crunch when you bite into it and the flavor of the lamb curry comes out fragrantly, accentuated by the veggies on top for fine crunch and freshness.

I ordered the veggie of the day which was a bhindi masala, the paneer tikka masala, and the saag paneer. Of the three, my favorite was the bhindi masala, probably because it was the driest option.I didn't realize that the roti taco could get a little soggy if not eaten right away. My least favorite of the three was the paneer tikka masala-- the sauce was a little too sweet and the paneer was a little rubbery. Overall, I think it was a good meal and an interesting twist but I think I'll stick to the bowl options next time."
1881,-Q8MYIWoE4EsGQtudIOY0w,9/5/2022,3 star rating,"Taco Mahal is a Mexican/Indian fusion offering a variety of tacos with your option of roti or naan in place of the tortilla, with naan being the most filling. They also offer basmati rice bowls, but we didn't try these. We ordered:Paneer Tikka Masala Naan Taco - The sauce/gravy is really good, but there wasn't really anything fusion about this except for the garnishes, which don't add much flavor, and the fact that the gravy is prefilled into the naan like a taco. The gravy as ""taco filling"" made for a VERY MESSY meal, so I prefer to eat it the traditional way instead of as a taco. Masala Fries - These were good, but there was very little masala flavoring. It was mostly regular fries with a little bit of cheese and masala sprinkled on top.Again, these didn't seem to be much of a fusion dish. The restaurant is small with a few tables inside and an enclosed outdoor dining space. There is no ventilation in the outdoor dining set up, so it was uncomfortably hot on an otherwise beautiful day."

But after speaking to Domino Pizza, Pizza Hut, Little Caesar, and other Franchise Pizzeria, they came to the conclusion the owner was fabricating. Maybe because his establishment is not doing too good, or his rent is too high. Nevertheless, the bottom line is one slice of pizza $3.50 is a rip off. And we are investigating this matter...."

Several weeks prior, I inquired inside and asked if generally they show UFC fights, the guy behind counter says yes they do. Fast forward to the day of event, I called early to reserve and confirm that the match will be shown, the girl on the phone seemed nice but clueless as to my inquiry, she tells me to call back in an hour when the boss gets in. I call back, the boss says yes they will show UFC but it'll be broadcast in Russian from some web stream. Long story short, we show up and order a bunch of stuff, at 10pm when the UFC was supposed to start, all of their TVs were showing some other sports, not at all UFC as promised. I inquire, guy says we're having technical difficulties we're working on it. 10:30pm still no UFC being shown on TVs, 10:45pm same story, talking to the boss was pointless. As we all started to get up and walk out in frustration, UFC comes on their TVs and immediately the screens freeze up in a buffering mode, hilariously frustrated we leave and go watch at Draft Barn, but at this point we've missed most of the matches. The owner/manager has a horrible attitude. If you're not a beer connoisseur and have no idea what beer you like or don't like, you'll be treated abrasively as in ""how dare you not know at least 50 beer types, their origins and chemical properties off the top of your head, hurry up and order, we're too busy for a novice like you."" You order beer at the counter, pay at the counter, and bring it yourself back to your table, yet they charge automatic service charge like 15% on everything they didn't actually serve at all.

Both inhaled their slices. My brother folded his cheese slice in the proper New York manner. The thin crust allowing for a nice fold. My Margherita style slice had whole tomato pieces as well as sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil and thin Â sliced garlic. Margherita doesn't always have garlic but it was sweet and worked in this case.

Tony Boloneys in Hoboken is the best. I will never order pizza from famous Amadeus! Glad I didn't get a calzone! The burger was cooked perfect and order was correct. JalapeÃ±os were fresh and spicy.

Drinks were boring and uninspired, we tried two cocktails and it was unclear if they were trying to be boring.PB&J snack sandwich was made with wonder bread, no creativity. It was basic. The hostess was rude. It was cold inside and the door was propped open in 50 degree weather. Another guest closed the door, only for the staff to reopen it in two minutes. Customers had to don their scarves and jackets on inside. We asked the hostess if they could close the door but she said ""no. We are going to keep the door open."" She subsequently walked away.Don't waste your money here, go somewhere else where they actually care about customer comfort."

The host was so friendly and got us seated so quickly! Everyone was following COVID safety protocols, and it was a fabulous time all around.The bar itself is so cute, with low lighting and a vibe that makes you want to stay and chill all night long. Perfect for a semi-upscale night out with some friends. I had three cocktails: the frozen watermelon drink, the Handsome Grandson and Vivian Darkbloom. Each were amazing and reasonably priced! If you're a fan of Gin, I definitely recommend the Handsome Grandson! Absolutely fabulous. I live so close to this amazing, stylish bar and I had no idea! Now that I know, this is definitely going to be my regular spot."

Â The bar staff was a bit non-chalant and weren't the BIGGEST helps on drink decisions, but I settled on the self-portrait. Â It was amazingly delicious. Â The cilantro tequila and habanero combined to form a spicy yet punchy pop when drinking this delightful concoction.

You order and pay first and they bring your food out. it is not a big place (seats maybe 25 people inside?). we had an avocado sandwich, lentil soup, a meatball sandwich, french fries, and a kale salad. we ended up not being in the mood for the avocado sandwich, but everything was nicely done."

It was a bit too chilly for outdoor dining, although they did have it available.The Cheeseburger was a good burger, but not great.

They had the classic egg and cheese with some salsa for about $5.95. +1.00 for bacon. Can't say no to bacon!Sandwich turned out smaller than the classic nyc deli sandwich. But the portion is just right and the quality is there. You get two organic eggs and a toasted buttered bun. Can't complain at all about the sandwich. Would love to also try other bites on the menu.

However, we mustn't forget our underdog friend, the neighborhood cafÃ©. Neighborhood cafÃ©s are the anchors within our communities, serving no frill, but certainly a daily thrill.I am a new customer, but Lincoln Station has already played its way into my Crown Heights morning tradition when visiting a good man pal of mine. Like any good neighborhood cafÃ©, it manages a good blend of the 4 essential C's: Convenience, Cost, Consistency, and, well, Coffee. I have only visited during the pandemic and, as such, there is no indoor dining, but there is plenty of al fresco seating. Simple chalk board menus are displayed with sandwich, salad, breakfast, and coffee options. The food items fall within the $6-$12 range and the coffee prices are on the low-end. Beer and wine are available for cheer and they also have a delectable display of in-house baked pastries.I have only ever ordered their:Cold brew ($4), brewed from La Colombe beans-- consistently strong yet bitter-free, with a free-willed oat milk pour.Breakfast sandwich ($5.95, option for +$1 bacon add-on): Sometimes, the simpler the better. Orwasher's buns serve as a vessel for a duo of over-easy eggs, melted cheddar, and salsa rosa to top (ketchup-mayo concoction). This filling morning meal is perfectly savory at a savory cost.TLDR; I would not seek Lincoln Station out as a destination cafÃ©, but this is a great place to start your morning if you are in the Crown Heights neighborhood and don't want to break the bank!"

I found Lincoln Station just a couple of blocks away, and it was certainly abuzz with activity as most of the seats were occupied, especially around the central communal table (photo: bit.ly/2UTB6TF). They appear to specialize in comfort food from pulled pork sandwiches to rotisserie chicken. But I was on a clock, so I got me a $2.75 Americano to go (photo: bit.ly/2SIyElA).

I usually really like what I get here and I think the prices are very reasonable for the neighborhood. My only suggestion is to get any sauce you want on the side as them can over drench it at times. Waffles are super dense and rich too, so make sure to get those if you have a sweet tooth too!"

Ordered takeout from here and got the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich, which was definitely the best thing I tasted from my order. Got the French Fries to accompany my sandwich which were pretty good. It also came with some ranch which was great. I also ordered the Power Slaw for some veggies and it was decent. Definitely on the healthier side when it comes to other slaws I've had. For dessert I got a side of the Chocolate Chip Waffle which was fine. By the end of the meal I was so stuffed. Not a bad spot to checkout."

We got the last table by the door but didn't mind it because there was plenty of space for two.My boyfriend ordered the Classic Chicken and Waffles and said that it was the best chicken and waffles he ever had! He ate it all but was gracious enough to let me have a bite of his waffle! The best part was the maple syrup. We weren't sure if it was honey or syrup at first because it tasted like honey but had a syrup consistency. Either way, we thought it was good.I ordered the Crispy Chicken Salad with Grilled Chicken. I've been on a health kick but didn't wanna pass up the opportunity to dine in. For those healthy eaters out there, their salad was a good portion. I saved half for dinner that night. The grilled chicken was nice and juicy. The portion of avocado was generous and the arugula was fresh. Pretty good salad for a fried chicken joint.Last but not least, we shared the Mac & Cheese. Their version was similar to a pasta salad but with light creamy cheese. It's not the hearty cheddar cheese version that you're used to at bbq places but it was still delicious because we ate it all. Definitely give this place a try if you're looking for comfort food!"

I think the chicken sandwich was really overpowered by the pickles, which I wish had an option to take them off on the app. As for the portion of chicken, it was pretty big compared to other chicken sandwiches I had. I wouldn't necessarily say I was a fan of the sauce either, it was definitely interesting and made the sandwich a bit soggy. The Mac and cheese was decent, I wish there was more of the topping mixed throughout or more of it."

Â I was here previously with a bunch of girlfriends for dinner. When I arrived, there was hand sanitizer and had my temperature checked. Staff wore masks and gloves. Since there were no servers allowed orders had to be made with the cashier prior to sitting if you are doing indoor dining. There were lots of pick up and delivery orders that were also taking place at the same time. Once my order was completed I was given a number and placed it on my table so the server will place the correct order. They limited menu because it was still brunch and they didn't have the items available until dinner and even until the restrictions are lifted in the next few weeks. Anyhow, I had to get to a cocktail. Since it was brunch I got the mimosa which was impressive large and strong for $12 then went further and ordered the hash browns $4 and classic chicken and waffles $16 which hit the spot. The quality of the food has not changed from the last time I was here. I would love return to Sweet Chick regardless of the location for dinner because I recall the desserts were to die for."

Every day, they have delicious platters upon platters of freshly cooked food, such as salmon, chicken (cooked in various ways), every type of vegetable, avocados (!!!), and honestly just about anything you can imagine. They price it by weight, but it's always way cheaper than I expect.Elim is very popular during lunch, so just be prepared to squeeze by and around people as you fill up your little to-go container of food. I never sit and eat here (except in the morning sometimes) because there are only about 8 seats and they're always full, especially during lunch time.I've also tried their bagel sandwiches, which the nice staff makes fresh right in front of you behind the counter. I had an Everything bagel with cheese, bacon, and egg -- so good. Also cheap.Couldn't be happier with this place!

It's small and slightly cramped and I wasn't too sure about it when I walked it. Â They have a couple of large buffet tables where you can get a very large variety of hot & cold foods by the pound or you can stand in line to order heroes, wraps, paninis, hamburgers, and the like.

My fried eggs were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of runniness, my ham was lightly browned and very tasty, and my hash browns were made of russet potatoes with grilled onions and bell peppers. My only complaint would be that my breakfast potatoes were kinda soft, but there were plenty of other kinds of potatoes available (deep fried, patties, etc.) that I would for sure try next time. Other than that, all my breakfast was great. Another plus is that there is a lot of open seating at Elim's, so I actually got to sit down for a minute for breakfast.

We had the white sangria to drink and for food we had the enchiladas de pollo con mole poblano and tacos (pastor, carne asada, & carnitas). The sangria was tasty, but relatively small compared to sangria at some other places. The enchiladas were good, but the sauce was perhaps a tad sweet. The tacos were generally good, but the meat and flavorings were overwhelmed by the amount of tortilla shell, making them feel a bit flavorless. Overall, the service, drink, and food were good, but not outstanding. I'd consider coming back."

If it's not busy, they'll only have one open.I am obsessed with the De Mole salad with breaded chicken. It's so healthy, delicious and I crave it pretty often. I've also had the steak and spinach quesadillas.This place is a little pricer than most spots in the area but it's worth it!"

But then a lot of the stuff in Chinatown Manhattan is on the bland side. I recommend coming here for the bakery rather than the bubble tea. That seems like an optional extra, and definitely not the specialty.Sweets is a cute little Bakery where the bubble tea was pretty average. Nothing more than a four-star but also good enough to not be less. The tapioca was nice and soft, at least. Next time I come back I will try all the baked goods that people are raving about."

The ladies working here are amazing: very cordial, quick, and smiley friendly!! No Chinatown gruffiness here.

Â All I tasted was pulp from the tapioca not juice. It was not cold despite being stored in the refrigerator. Â In scanning the refrigerator for bubble tea without tapioca (either black or white) unfortunately there were none.The baked goodies are abundant, no comment as I did not purchase any.

Their bar is fully stocked with different Scotches and Bourbons. Sure there's a Jameson bottle front and center, their menu board breaks down the different Scotch regions. I want to sit here for hours and taste everything but I have Ranger tickets (Lets go Rangers) in my pocket and so I have to bolt.I've been reading the menu online, I want an Old Fashioned Cocktail and the most Instagrammed Burger on the planet, The Smash Burger.My drink comes to me quickly. I should have asked for more ice! Man, that is one chilly willy. The ice is a bit much IMHO. Forget all that nonsense, the Smash Burger is their recreation of a Big Mac. The Spaniard burger is simple, two all smashed patties, special sauce, lettuce, American cheese, pickles all on a sesame seed bun. Merica!The Spaniard Burger is very juicy and flavorful, you want to keep coming back for more. Unlike the thick patty Black Label Burger served at Minetta Tavern, each Spaniard patty is smashed flat. It's different but that's where that beautiful crispy, grilled outside caramelization shines. It was soooo good! I liked the special sauce, I wanted Ketchup but I was afraid to ask. hahaIncredible burger, great Scotch selections, NYC is opening again and you need to dine at The Spaniard."

Food was inedible but we were so hungry that we ate it.

Food wise, I had the hot chicken sandwich. It brought a nice blend of heat, but should definitely be served with a side of some either sweet or ranch like sauce. Overall it had pretty good flavor, but it also was a little small and not a huge by meal by any means. The poutine and regular French fries are both winners. Hand-cut and thick but not steak fries. Definitely home made and worth the splurge. A solid place, probably a little on the higher end than it needs to be on the price point, but then again, look at the location. It is also a ~trendy~ place. I'd go back."

I arrived a bit earlier so I skipped the line. It is an interesting vibe, nice spot to people watch. The drinks are solid, I had a great spicy margarita and a delicious espresso martini - both not too strong or too weak. The prices are consistent with the standard for NYC bars. I did notice some of the other drinks, like my friend's tequila soda, were very watered down, which was a bit disappointing. Again, it does get crowded so you will most likely spend most of your time standing. It can get pretty hard to access the bar and order drinks. Another thing is that it gets pretty hot in there with so many people in a small space. As long as you are aware of what you are signing up for, you will have a great time here!"
1985,Y9ZC2tx4ReQqA40LEPErwQ,12/6/2021,4 star rating,Randomly was in NYC and nearby the Spaniard. Heard they have a good burger. My wife and I got the smash burger and the patty melt and fries. The Smash burger was excellent. Great take on the Big Mac. Def wouldn't hesitate to order again. Fries were very good as well. The patty melt wasn't on the same level of excellence as the smash patty unfortunately. Found it strange that they didn't have either unsweetened iced tea or diet soda for my wife. They also did not have their Cesar salad available. They have quite the selection of whiskeys and I had a nice pour of George T. Stagg. Def would go back for the smash burger again.

My wife had the Avocado toast with sliced hard boiled egg on top. My Daughter had a bacon egg and cheese, we ordered 2 sides of crispy bacon cooked perfectly and a side of biscuits with butter, the biscuits were amazing! We enjoyed our meal very much. We were having a conversation with the server, about current state of pandemic. Server brought my wife a complimentary glass of champagne for being a Frontline worker/medical provider. It was my wife's first day off in 8 months, the gesture brought tears to her eyes for being acknowledged. It was very nice of them to do that, it made her day.

They have so many shows the last several I went to weren't that crowded and the dance floor had space, thankfully. I, however, wouldn't recommend bowling. Every time I've bowled here super drunk people have been on all sides of me, in my lane, sitting in my area and have spilled their food and drinks on me. Not a great place to bowl (especially when there is a show).Don't even get me started about the food. The last time I was here (for the Zapp band) I got here early and went to the restaurant. I've been here many times over the years. However, this time I had the bean and kale soup. I don't recommend this at all! I kid you not I was sick and in the bathroom at BB the entire night!I'd come back here for another show - food or bowling, no way!"

We were there early and not too many people so the ""fun"" hadn't really started. We had a drink and apps at the bar then proceeded to bowling. Having just been to a bowling hotspot in another big city I was surprised about the pricing. You pay in 30 minute increments - no one bothered to tell us you have 2 minutes from when you get your shoes and the clock starts. For the price, you'd think you could atleast have a minute to order a drink. We rushed to finish our game - the waiter asked if we wanted another game - not at the crazy price. We could have paid an extra $20 each (i think that's right) to stay and listen to music but Id already spent $130 for one game, 2 drinks and some wings so I too my money elsehwere.All in all a pretty disappointing visit."
1992,l-oj1yA5liiFEEwoi-1ELA,7/9/2020,4 star rating,"While the atmosphere in this establishment is fine by me, as a minority person, I need to speak out on an uncomfortable situation that I was put in. Â  Â  I came alone. I had a meal at the bar. I had to excuse myself during the meal to use the restroom. Leaving the restroom, I went to take a look at the bowling alleys, as a private party was going on there & only invited persons could bowl. A white female employee approached me & truthfully acknowledged that I was dining alone & as the only person at a small bar & I had not paid for my meal & to please do so. In this day & age, such in unapproachable (the bartender who served me & security personnel were all black men; I was perhaps the only black female in the entire building at the time). Â  Â  What that white female employee did to me is racial profiling. Such is wrong. She had no right to assume that I would never pay the bartender. It is also inappropriate to ask for ID with credit or debit cards, as some persons share accounts with parents, employers or domestic partners & only one name will appear on the card. Retail, stand-alone bars & restaurant employees do not ask for ID for debit nor credit cards. I wasn't offended that I was asked for ID but, as a black woman, I can tell you that with other minority persons, such may not be the case.  Â  Â  If I do return to this establishment, it most likely will be with white persons who I know."

I enjoyed everything from the bowling to the decor and the food. I went during the early afternoon, which is a great time if you're planning to go with the family. We opted for 2 hours for the lanes, which in turn ends up being about 2 bowling games depending on how big your team is. We ordered a variety of finger foods. The smoked wings were by far my favorite. The Mac and cheese bites and loaded fries tie for second place. There were so many options to choose from. I would definitely come back to Brooklyn Bowl. This is a great place for date nite or even just to hang with the family!"
1996,l-oj1yA5liiFEEwoi-1ELA,2/22/2019,4 star rating,"I wish I was there the moment whoever came up with the concept of Brooklyn Bowl. Just imagining someone saying: Ok, check this out, I want to take a big warehouse space - put in a restaurant, large bar, a stage area, and now, get this, about a dozen bowling lanes! It probably sounded like madness and the reality is it doesn't work perfectly, but I have to say this place is lots of fun.The awkwardness of hearing people bowl between songs making the singer comment ""Hey, I think someone just picked up that spare!"" - it seems and feels a little disrespectful to the musicians on stage. Throw in a sound engineer sitting directly on the stage in full view of the audience looking bored to high heaven, eating food from a take out container, or practicing on his drum pad makes this place less a cathedral to music, but rather a carnival for adults. Really though, it's probably rock or something equally heavy emanating from the stage so who gives a crap?! - just play it LOUD!We made a night of it, coming in for happy hour and meal. The food is decent, but truly those $5 beers until 8pm were going down nicely. We had the buffalo cauliflower, which came with a side of buffalo sauce and blue cheese - it tasted like it was reheated, but good flavor. The blue cheese salad with bacon and chicken was fresh and generous. The oyster po'boy was a bit on the bland side - I enjoyed the roll it was served on, but a shot of hot sauce was needed to give this thing flavor. The bread pudding dessert was more like a warm cake - forgettable. Great full service bar - I was drinking some of Brooklyn's Brewery Bel Air Sours.The large bar that anchors the lounge and concert area is well laid out. If you are not drinking they have cold water dispensers on either end with plenty of plastic cups so no need to purchase water bottles, or bother bartenders who should be tending to the partiers in the room. In the performance area there are communal picnic tables along the sides and large open space in the center."

Second time around ended up here again for the 2000's party this time stuck to beer had some Lagunitas IPA nice strong beer not bad. Party itself dragged for a bit till it finally got started at around 1 music was good but didn't last long? Done at 230?? What the hell .. no idea why it was cut short.My last visit finally gave the food a try, we came in on a Sunday since we were in the area , drinks had some white wine, Pinot not bad & hubby bad beer good as well. On the food we tried the Chicken nuggets these are grilled which was a nice surprised since I didn't notice on the menu they were good nuggets, nice dipping sauces the Mac & cheese was really good as well also had the 2 pc fried chicken comes with mash potatoes , the fried chicken was very good, crispy nice flavor great when dripped with the honey, good mash potatoes. This place is pretty cool u get some dancing space, bar area & bowling not a bad way to spend an afternoon or night. Service depends on the crowds can be quick enough or kind of slow , price wise not bad normal to the area during the parties it was packed house on a Sunday afternoon not so much either way not a bad place to catch a show, dance party or just for an afternoon of bowling."

Big pieces which is a plus-seafood soon tofu is really good. Comes with side of egg and provides lots of seafood- the bonchon provided is great! They refill very quickly too unlike other establishments-cold bibimpap is very good. Love the sauce- can be a bit pricey even for the lunch specials but it is worth it.
2005,qEbQbYZxurnuVxDrNHQUJg,11/19/2022,5 star rating,"Tl;DR - The best Korean spot in Chinatown. Must get Korean Fried Chicken if you ever come here (might take some time for it to come since they cook it fresh). If you just wanted the Korean Fried Chicken, they have a sister location called Tada (70 Bayard St) which is not too far. They have lunch specials even on weekend from 11am to 3pm for the Soondubu. Also the owner Kelly is really nice and keeps an eye out for all the customers. Overall Ratings - Factoring in taste, portion, and costSoondubu - 10/10. Tasted great with you get the soondubu as well as a rice on the side. You are able to pick your flavor and I usually go with mild. You can also choose what goes into the soup with options like beef, seafood, kimchi, fish cakes, etc. Good value during lunch with it being $11.95 during lunch special. Korean Fried Chicken - 10/10. We got the sweet and spicy flavor. Don't worry about the spice as it is not spicy and more of a mild spice. It is amazing in flavor and the skin is crunchy. The 5 piece drumstick is enough for 2 people (assuming one person eats only 2 pieces) but might leave you craving for more because of how good it is. Remember that these drumsticks are huge as it looks like they came from super buff chickens or something. Bonchon - 10/10. It is free and you get the normal bonchon. Kimchi is always present with the other bonchon sometimes rotating. Also, if you have a big enough party (maybe 6 or more), you get a steam egg as the bonchon. They might do this during dinner as well, but don't quote me on that. I got it a couple of times when I had a big table."
2006,qEbQbYZxurnuVxDrNHQUJg,7/1/2022,5 star rating,"The best Korean restaurant in the area. A bit expensive, but considering it's Manhattan and there's no similar competition, it's fair. Food is also consistently good. Banchan is generous, kimchi is just spicy and sweet enough, not too funky. They have lunch prices until 3pm every day, which is $1-2 off most items. The only complaint is I wish the rice was better quality, like most other Korean restaurants I've gone to before. @ squid tofu soup with rice - ask for spicier than you expect, they don't add too much spiciness, looks red and medium hot, but tastes like mild, good flavor, goes great with rice, comforting blobs of tofu@ cold bibimbap - scratches the itch for bibimbap, super healthy. The sauce isn't spicy at all though. Could be most exciting."
2007,qEbQbYZxurnuVxDrNHQUJg,8/5/2022,5 star rating,"The food and service here are both super amazing! My friend introduced me to this place and there were a total of 5 of us going to the restaurant. I originally ordered a mild tofu soup since I was a bit sick but thought I could handle the mild spice level. Sadly I was wrong and it was a bit too spicy for my throat on that day. Luckily the owners were super duper nice and remade the tofu soup with no spice in it for me! I was super duper grateful. Not only that, there were a bunch of yummy side dishes and even though we only had 5 people, they gave us two sets of side dishes and 2 complimentary super good steamed eggs! Overall, I would definitely want to come back here ahai"

They barely stopped by our table. You'll have better luck just going up to them to order your food or get the check. For some reason, they only have 2 owners(?)/people taking orders while multitasking other responsibilities. The rest of the many workers being allocated to deliver food.Anyway, I ordered the bulgogi hot pot and it lacked flavor. I personally felt like it was overpriced for the quality I was receiving. The food came in relatively fast by the rest of the workers. Overall, I recommend coming if you're just walking by and want something to enjoy. Just don't get the bulgogi hot pot. It has some good vibes, and the food does arrive quite fast."

The only odd thing was that the buffalo sauce was on the side, but I can overlook that detail because they were so damn good. Delivery came promptly at the time it said it would too. I definitely plan on ordering again. Maybe next time I'll try the pizza."
2010,QbAfrOxbuYKU248SDXHZEQ,11/9/2017,3 star rating,"I decided while walking home that the first pizza joint I came to I'd try out. This place seemed a bit pricey in comparison to many 99cent pizza places in the area. Two slices of pizza, one slice of margarita and one slice of pepperoni cost $7. I wouldn't say there was much difference in taste then the cheaper option, the size was the same as well. The ambience was better than a 99cent place and the service was decent."

It was a little dark so when I ate my first slice of pepperoni pizza I was taken aback by how weird it tasted. Found out quickly I was eating veggie--didn't even know we got a veggie pizza. Anyway, I had some veggie, cheese, and pepperoni. Obviously the pep was the best! We demolished the boxes in under 5 minutes and then decided to explore about 8 other rooftops that we could climb onto from that one."

Or if it is, they do it the Italian way very nicely. Not the best, but how does one find the best slice in Manhattan anyway?? This is a solid bet for pizza in the LES."
2016,QbAfrOxbuYKU248SDXHZEQ,9/14/2016,3 star rating,"The grandma slice was respectable though not Bensonhurst-caliber. But the plain slice has an unforgivably low amount of tomato sauce. At some point in the past there was a proper amount of sauce, judging by the Yelp photos."

It, however didn't have any super awesome flavor though. It was decent but underwhelming.The plain fries dipped in Lucky sauce are to die for.Wash it down with some Boylan's root beer and you have yourself a solid meal if you're in the area."
2020,ThOqBoltiH9qwHmUsMIt5g,10/9/2017,4 star rating,Went to Lucky's a few weeks ago before attending a birthday gathering and needed something to eat before drinks. Very good burgers here and fries as well. I like the different sauce options that they give including the chipotle mayo and lucky's famous sauce which both were very good.Cheeseburger was very good with the sauces. Next time I'm here which hopefully will be soon will most likely try either the BBQ Bacon or the Chelsea. Good service here as well.

Definitely a bit more pricier than fast food, but having a Boylan's self serve soda machine with multiple options is a nifty perk!I had not seen one of these before as most places offer the standard Pepsi and Coke machines. Black Cherry, Root Beer, Lemon Lime, Birch Beer, regular and diet.There are 7-8 meal deals to choose from among other menu items. I had the standard cheeseburger with the works and fries. Pretty solid and satisfied my hunger pains before heading out to the next bar."

They have turkey, veggie burgers, the beyond burger, the impossible burger and chicken. I had the turkey burger. It was very good. Â They have a lot of toppings offerings. The burgers are made to order. If you are a health enthusiast this is not the place. It is very basic. They did bring my order to my table which I totally appreciated.

Hoping its just a me thing, because Luckys is so convenient for me. But eh - well see. OH! Thee fries, amazing, never went wrong with Luckys Fries!

You've got to add 'Chelsea Sauce' (BBQ sauce, Honey Mustard and Wasabi Cucumber sauce) and 'Lucky's Sauce' (Smoky Mayo) to EVERYTHING!We were so lucky that Britney was behind the register and explained all the sauces to us and also gave us her personal preference on how she tops her burger and fries Â ( She mixes Chelsea sauce and Lucky's sauce).Overall, between the customer service and quality of the food, this was phenomenal! :)"
2027,ThOqBoltiH9qwHmUsMIt5g,12/11/2018,2 star rating,"Felp deleted my original real review. This is the new one, watered down for your basic pleasure: So, Jerome was polluted last night. And pretty much on the verge of death. After a tuff day, I drank way too much at this bar on a roof near Madison Sq park that had red robes, but that's not really important. What is important is my drunk ass went to Hill Country and had two thighs ( muy delicioso ) and kept it moving on 23rd street all the way to Boston Market. Yes, I wanted more chicken. Scratch that, I NEEDED more food. Anything would have been good at this point, otherwise, that A train ride uptown wouldn't have been good for me or anyone in the car with me. The ""I don't give AF"" counter girl gave me a look when I walked in that translated to: "" Get the hell out, we're closing in 10 minutes and if you order something, I WILL spit on it"". I'm a very self aware person (even when drunk), so Elvis exited stage right and walked across the street to Lucky's to fill my gut. It had to be done. Now, I haven't been here in a minute and my memory is horrible. The drugs and/or alcohol combo of intake over the span of my life has left me with two brain cells and those bastards have been clashing like Israel and those Hummus guys for supremecy. I actually walked in here thinking, ""oh, I've never been here before"". What. A. Douche. Well, after reading my original review this a.m.... it's worse, than originally chronicled. Even drunk. I judge a burger in it's most basic form: no sauce, no cheese, and the usual suspects of onion plus tomato. My drunk ass got lettuce with it, which I normally don't. Anyway, this burger was sad and a snooze fest. The bun was dry and limp. Pause. The meat is bland and generic. Still, it did save my life, so for that it gets one star. Plus, the sauce options and quality of drinks does deserve to be recognized. The fries are horrific. Crinkle cut, is the worst cut, but the taste of their fries make me want to run in front of a moving cab, head first. It tasted like a generic version of BK fries. I love fries. It's so upsetting when someone fucks up a fried potato. The food quality and taste here is like a national chain, but on some Shake Shack kind of price point. Happy now, Yelp? Is this review, edited enough for your viewing pleasure?"

Called then and the snotty girl who answers the phone asks me to send her a picture as she can tell if the pizza is cold? Really? I offer to send it back and she asked for a picture.

I ordered three slices: a margarita, a pepperoni, and not sure what the last one was called but it's in the attached photo hahaThe only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the services was mediocre. Not bad, but just a guy shouting, ""next,"" for each guest's order and an aloof cashier. I'll still be coming back for the great pizza!"
2032,rGmGim1ZDCxnF8n4NiKrYQ,8/6/2022,1 star rating,This spot was an initial pandemic favorite in 2020. Â  Â  the marinara pizza was very flavorful back then. Â Tonight I wanted to order my same usual pizza and now there literally there is no seasoning or flavor on the pizza. Â Did they change recipes or management---- Â like it was one of the worst pizzas i've eaten. Â The texture was on point but it basically tasted like a unsalted cracker with tomato sauce.

They offered a Caprese (which I ended up choosing), a typical veggie blend which looked like it had mushrooms (which I don't like) and one that looked like mostly sauce. The slices were a little hard to see so I hastily placed my order. That's on me; I should've taken more time to search for a good option. The food wasn't bad, just nothing as yummy as I've had at another inexpensive NY pizza-by-the-slice joint. The mozzarella on the Caprese is super thick which isn't for me. I wouldn't return. They do have a few outdoor tables."
2036,rGmGim1ZDCxnF8n4NiKrYQ,12/3/2022,5 star rating,Great service. Quickly gave us the pizza and nice customer service at counter. Gave us plates to eat the pizza with. Spacious area and lot of tables and chairs to eat on. Food is spectacular. Highly recommend it.
2037,rGmGim1ZDCxnF8n4NiKrYQ,11/28/2022,1 star rating,Now I know why I stopped going there. The most disgusting looking pizza I've had ever. There was no cheese on the vegetable pizza except in the very tip of the triangle and the Margarita had a little blob of cheese again on the tip of the triangle it looked like a pizza had been sitting there for days. Never again will I go back there.

The plain pie was decent, the pesto pie was good but SO oily (I folded the slice in half and was holding it and the oil started dripping down my hand). The garlic knots were very good, perfectly crispy on the outside and warm/soft on the inside and the marina sauce that came with it tasted good. Realistically, I'm not sure if I'd go again"

It was the Monday after Pride, which happened to be my birthday, and my girlfriend and I popped in for a drink or two. Deb was the only one behind the bar, thanked us all for being there, and announced she was ordering us all pizza on the house! Free shots were then passed around to those who wanted one and the atmosphere was really kickin'. When my girlfriend had gone up to get our second round she mentioned to Deb that it was my birthday, unbeknownst to me, and before we dug in to the pies Deb got the entire bar to sing me happy birthday. It was such a wonderful way to spend the afternoon and I sincerely appreciated the welcoming and positive energy from Deb."

Â The overall place has a nice vibe and the drinks are fine, but after overhearing an older female bartender (ironically wears a ""Good Girls Are Boring"" t-shirt) be so nasty to the customer to both the left and right of us immediately killed our vibe. Â We witnessed her berate a customer for trying to order a drink, then rudely demanded another customer to leave more tip money. Â My gosh. Â I didn't know people still actually treated others like this, especially in a community that is supposed to encourage a safe space in general. Â We weren't directly affected, but witnessing these two interactions made us feel so unwelcome here that my group immediately left."

Everyone pretty much stays to themselves and you'll get the occasional flirty women here and there. When my partner and I arrived it was fairy empty, around 10ish the crowd started to pick up and it became standing room only. The music is controlled by the guest which is a unique feature of the bar. It's always changing and surprisingly there was a good mixture of genres playing. The drinks were a little disappointing. They were a little light on the liquor but I guess that's bar tactic-makes you keep coming back. All in all I had no complaints, crowd was low-key, music is upbeat and it's a chill place. The non judgemental feels of the place would keep me coming back, I enjoyed my partner being there with me and the look of happiness on everyone's face."

However, I go to the bar and ask the bartender is there is a menu per chance with them to reply ""This is a bar"" in a condescending tone, as if I'm stupid. At that point I'm just like okay whatever that's fine, I order a drink and then they ask to see my ID. Like, how did you think I was able to enter the bar in the first place? This was my first time going to Cubby, I've always wanted to go for a while but I'm disappointed in having such an unwelcoming and rude experience. Do better."

2049,C69uTzoWFaIWcpnYf2LbRw,2/10/2018,5 star rating,This is it. The neighborhood spot you go to for consistently delicious pizza. The slices here are so dang good. My usual order is one Buffalo Chicken slice and one plain. The Buffalo slice does not have marinara in it- so I like having the regular to balance it out. The Buffalo Chicken slice has just enough punch of heat without being too much. The plain cheese slice is just perfection. The cheese to sauce ratio is on point and its never too greasy. They've really got it down to a science. There is a good amount of seating (largest booth seats 4) and the service is always friendly. There's a $10 minimum to use credit cards. Dante's is just plain awesome. You gotta go.

Unfortunately now that I live in Briarwood, instead of Kew Gardens, they don't deliver to my address. But it's still worth the drive. ***plus when I'm in the area I can stop at Aigner's Chocolates. Yum! My favorite part about this pizza spot is the fact that they make small, medium, and large pies (this includes specialty pies). My favorite is their chicken Caesar. It's 2nd to none! I love that I can get a small (6 slices) pie, allowing me to order another small pie. My husband and I always order the same thing: Small Chicken Caesar Pie, Small Cheese Pie, Garlic Knots, which comes to $24.50. It's a great deal! There's only 2 of us so we just enjoy cold leftovers for the next day or 2. Yep, it tastes great cold."

It's by all means not cheap at all, but they're, for the most part worth it. Â This location is small and can get quite hectic. Expect a wait but nothing outrageous especially at lunch time. It helps to know what you want when you get in there especially during peak times because if you don't you'll likely just annoy everyone else around you causing a very unpleasant experience.

Â Lenny's do not deny my personal choice of sliced white bread but they do deny the add-on of a beverage or chips to be included.

Although it seems like a stressful madhouse at lunchtime, they move you along and get you out the door fairly quickly, with minimal hassle. However, if you want your experience to be completely hassle-free, I recommend ordering online and picking it up. This will allow you to take your time and pick through their many combos, or to build a sandwich with their countless toppings and innumerable bread options. I happen to like Jimmy T.* He gets me.Whichever sandwich you choose will be neither transcendent nor cheap, but it will be sizable, and made quickly with quality ingredients. And that's nothing to sneeze at around here.__________*Chicken cutlet, mozzarella, grilled onions, sweet peppers, honey mustard."

That was after I ate their sandwich. Overall I thought their food was average, not any more special than many of the other flooded similar deli's in the city.

Their sandwiches are slightly more expensive than the prices you would see in delis (about $8 to $10 for a sandwich). You can also have them make you your own custom salad or sandwich from all their available ingredients.The sandwiches here are okay and are nothing innovative. They are actually not much better than Subway's sandwiches to me. I would say the ingredients seem to be higher quality, but they should be due to the higher price."

It was the first location where my dad bought the first wedges which is the first meal that I tasted and just that alone then later on chicken with mashed potatoes, biscuits and gravy, you name it! I give this a perfect five out of five because it is set on a nice location where it's not so busy even during morning rush hours and evening Let go's or layoffs from work and both the staff and customers tend to be nice to each other. There was never a bad moment in where I was caught in the middle of an argument or where two people fought over chicken. It's that peaceful and God bless them all for it!"

BOTH times they only sent part of the order. This last time they sent only 1 meal when I ordered 2. READING MUST BE HARD because whoever is handling these online orders at the store clearly doesn't know how to read. Because I only got half my order, my 3-piece meal just cost me almost $35. They don't even answer the damn phone so I couldn't even speak to anyone about it. Never again. Not for take out or eat in. They just lost a customer for good."

I wasn't sure at first if we will like the food but since it was nearby to our hotel, so i decided to celebrate birthday here. And im glad that we came to this place because surprisingly this place has a good steak with good quality .From starters, we tried the thick bacon, jumbo lump crabmeat cocktail, crab cake, tuna tartar , calamari and the Tuscany salad. All the appa was amazing just not crazy about the crab cake.And our main we had couple of porterhouse ( since it was 11 peoples), tomahawk, few pastas, tuna,,sea bass and their special fish of the day stripe bass. We're not too crazy about the Tuna and the stripe bass. And we had some sides : sauteed mushroom, sauteed spinach, onion rings and steak fries.Dessert: creme brulee and tiramisu. We all agree that we loved the tiramisu. You can taste the liquorOverall we loved 80% of the food here.We're definitely be back"

Great for a romantic date, family gathering or a quick stop at the bar. Try the tapas! My favorites are gambas al ajillo, calamari al ajillo, tortilla espaÃ±ola, There are others that are super good, too. The paella is a hit with my family and we love everything on the menu. Mom had the Pollo Riazor, a huge dish of roasted chicken and potatoes. Amazing portions and the food comes quickly and is hot when it gets to the table. Really enjoy this place and we will keep coming back. The service is as wonderful as the food! Happy hour in the bar is a real treat if you like to have drinks with late lunch/early dinner. The chocolate cake is also amazing! And I cannot forget Miriam's cappuccino which is the best in town!! Â We love this place!"

First of all, the portion was SMALL!!!! The plates and pans were no bigger than my palm and we left the restaurant hungry. Secondly, the quality of the food was just bad. The Patatas bravas was basically some fried potatoes with a spoon of tomato sauce. The ham was thick and uneven, which made it really hard to chew. The Pan com tomate with just a slice of tomato on bread. The only thing I would recommend is just the Spanish chorizos. We ended up spending around $50 each on some mediocre food. Definitely not coming back!!!"

This restaurant offers not just expensive food but also terrible food quality.. You pay $9 for ""bravas"" that are reheating in the microwave and octopus that I can easily tell that was cooked a week ago.. Moreover, the waitress ignored us during the whole lunch but she wanted to charge us 20% obligatory gratuity.An authentic disappointing experience.. Being all said, I am Spanish."

Not original food from Spain."
2096,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,7/8/2016,4 star rating,"Pretty good. Service was very warm & familial. The pulpo gallego was tasty. Paella casera was delish- a big old pot of paella. Cant go wrong witg that. The carne guisada was also very good. The meat was tender and exactly what i was expecting. The torta de almendras was so good. Texture was of a dry madeline with almond flavor & whip cream. Very good. All of the food tasted fresh & well traditionally seasoned. Prices are very reasonable. Decor and ambiance was well done & what u would expect of a family-run restaurant. We walked in- no reservation needed. They can accommodate groups if necessary, and have a fun looking bar. The music was awesome! Great flamenco/tablao music. Made me want to stomp around and dance! They accept credit cards (other than AmEx). So maybe the ""cash & American Express"" policy was overturned since a previous yelpers review. One down side is that they automatically add a 20% tip onto the bill so be mindful so you dont double tip which i am sure they are banking on, especially if the customer had a pitcher or 2 of sangria. I recommend this restaurant and return again when in the area."
2097,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,5/12/2017,3 star rating,"Went on a weekday evening evening and it was quite empty. Like what others have mentioned, the decor is cramped ( fortunately, no one else was in the restaurant area otherwise we would have ""bumped"" into other patrons - that's how close the tables and chairs are ) and ""traditional"" but dated. Reminded me of some of the other ""old time"" Spanish restaurants I've been to around the city. We ordered 4 tapas Â - squid in garlic, shrimp in garlic, potatoes with tomatoes, and stuffed mushrooms. It was all fine/ok but not extraordinary. And it was pricey. Each tapas dish costs approximately 8.50 - 9.50 and with 2 drinks our bill came out to be 70.00 with tip."

I tried 5-6 of their tapas and they were all seasoned very well and had great flavor. I also had a bowl of their chicken soup and that was also very good as well. Dishes to try: mushroom tapas, scallops, octopus, and the garlic bread with the tomato on top. Service was attentive and got to is as soon as we needed anything. Overall a great restaurant if you like Traditional Spanish tapas."

Â I came here twice and I won't stop coming back - it's an affordable place with a wide selection of good and healthy food! Also, their proportions are huge - so typically a small salad WILL do justice to your stomach! They don't only sell salads; Ovi's also offers paninis, sandwiches, omelettes, actual meals like chicken, rice, macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, fruit salads, desserts (cookies, bag of nuts, etc). They also have smoothies that they make for you (fresh) or you can opt for Naked beverages in the fridge as well as other assortment of unhealthy drinks (Pepsi, coca cola, etc). Seriously, this place is awesome! I recommend the chef salad, but you could also build your own salad, which is also pretty neat ! XD"

Ovi's Place is right near the Brooklyn College campus and has some good food and it's really easy on the wallet.I always get their chicken breast and 1 side meal and I'm never disappointed. The grilled chicken has the right mix of juicy with a nice bit of char around the edging and their sides are huge portions of greens, mac and cheese, salad or 3 to 4 other options that I haven't tried yet. I told the guy who was ringing me up that I liked spicy and now he puts a couple of other pickled veggies on that give it that extra kick along with their hot sauce. So glad this place is around because otherwise it would be nothing but the Golden Arches or BK to eat."

There aren't many options that deliver so we were excited when this new place had a delivery option. The order did not arrive until 2 hours later and the food came in cold and hard shell tacos soggy. The burritos were sub par at most, it is something you could eat if you're super hungry and don't care Â  Â how good it tastes. We also ordered sour cream on the side which turned out to literally be ""sour""... hopefully we don't get sick from eating rotten food.

The chicken was roasted and OK. Moist enough, but seriously bland. The green plantains were what they should be, as were the collard greens, which benefitted from the vinegary hot sauce. I would not order from them again. A half chicken must have the drumstick AND the wing."

First, thank you for the nice little sample cup you give with the smoothie. If it weren't for this little cup, I wouldn't have known that my smoothie was bad. It tasted like the fruit had gone bad. When I told the lady that made it she looked at the berries and says they are fine. I asked her can I individually taste the blueberries. She comes back with a spoon of 3, I'm guessing she tried to choose the best ones. The first blueberry was fine but the second Â almost made me throw up in my mouth. Obviously, the blueberries had gone bad, which she denied. I had three different women in my face telling me the blueberries were fine and the drink tasted fine. Talk about customer service skills. My instinct was to leave but I knew it was just fruit and that they might not be well trained in customer service. So I allowed them to make me another smoothie. This time with just strawberries and banana. It tasted a little better but almost the same like the banana was going bad, I threw it out. Lesson learned go with your instinct... Side note: the blueberries are frozen then thawed, what happened to fresh fruit smoothie? Over this place entirely."

I should've gotten her name...first of all, I told her I wanted the Kramer salad and she asked me if I wanted dressing and I said no dressing. And she repeated herself and so I repeated myself. So she made the salad with no dressing and it was warm...I don't know why but who eats salads warm? It was disgusting. And I also asked for a BLT with ketchup, no mayo. She put mayo, no ketchup. And the worst part? It looks disgusting and tasted disgusting. I wish I took a picture of it but I was too disgusted. It looked like she tossed it around and then wrapped it. It was extremely messy when I got it and I am extremely dissatisfied, I do not recommend this place and I definitely won't be back."

For just $10 you get 3 nice sized tostadas that are piled with octopus, avocado, queso, beans, and pico. Â I also really enjoyed their fish tacos, made with fried basa filet, mango salsa and pickled onions. They serve them with chipotle mayo which may or not be your thing depending on whether you prefer a more authentic Mexican fish taco.They do serve some dishes in traditional mexican ways, including the quesedillas.

Unless your looking for bagels or pizza. I did however have the opportunity to eat at Cantina's. Â It's been by far the best food I've tried. (That includes Mezcals) Their mexican food was extremely authentic. Adrian the owner was pleasant enough to strike up a convo and tell me about their new restaurant. He's been working in the business for over 20yrs and knows his stuff. Unfortunately they dont have the liquor license yet. But the food is definitely worth coming for. I had three tacos - chicken fish and pastor. All super flavorful. He also let me try their 3 homemade hot sauces. Really good. Cantinas was an awesome find. These guys are gonna kill it."

The first time I called. Granted I understand they are busy. If I ask for an update on my order I expect a proper response. Not a response that doesn't fulfill my needs as a customer. If you don't have drivers. Say so. If you cannot process my order say so. Don't keep me waiting hours later to them tell me you don't have drivers and my order hasn't even been cooked yet. Then when I ask to speak to a manager he says ""I am the manager "" and doesn't even apologize and just says ""I cancelYour order "" now it is 845 and I cannot order else where because it is too late at this hour .

He threw the guy out and cursed him out, all because he was rooting for Seattle. My friends come here regularly, but this was my first time. If this is how the owner treats his customers, its the last time I'll spend my money here. If you do come, watch out for the Big guy with the huge belly who sits at one of the tables in the back. He's a nut job"

The bartender is personable and so so quick, and the atmosphere is warm and homey. Make sure you eat beforehand, because they don't have a kitchen and the drinks are reasonably priced enough that you'll likely have several. But they allow outside food in. Â All in all, an ideal neighborhood bar with a great staff and friendly crowd. Thumbs up."

Holy crap , these dumplings were so good! They joined forces with Emily's burgers to create this dumpling and it is out of this world amazing."
2130,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,2/11/2020,4 star rating,"The dumplings here are indeed costlier than what you can get at your average Chinatown dumpling shop, but pricing for food is all arbitrary and no one can make a profit selling dumplings for 25 cents a pop in the Â East Village, so I think the complaints about their prices are moot points. The rotating monthly specials are always so inventive and are what keep me perpetually keen on return visits. This time it was the French Onion Soup dumplings that caught my Â attention and absolutely delighted my taste buds.February is a good month for a special like this because we're all just seeking something warm and comforting to get us through these winter blues. While it might be tempting to share a few options with friends, I think the move here is to get a plate to yourself so you can have the joy of biting into the al dente dumpling skin and letting the cheese and flavorful soup fill your mouth over and over again. Yes the experience is as sensual as it sounds.Douse your dumplings in their house made chili oil for extra oomph."
2131,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,12/13/2021,4 star rating,"Came in here with a group of friends after wandering Lower east side and being rejected from several restaurants because we didn't have reservations. The service here is really fast. We got the pork and chives dumplings and dan dan noodles. The pork dumplings were cooked very well. There are two types of fillings for the dumplings and they are differentiated by their shapes. The dan dan noodles were very yummy and had an unexpected spicy kick to it. I personally loved it but if you do not eat spicy, be aware of it."
2132,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,6/15/2021,3 star rating,"Dumplings were delicious fresh. The sauce wasn't very special (standard dipping sauce - no spice or chili oil). More of a cutesy americanized place than a hole in the wall shop, and prices definitely align with that. $14 for 8 dumplings Â Service was great and staff wore masks."
2133,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,3/18/2020,3 star rating,"The dumplings are okay. Certainly nothing to rave about, especially for the price, but they'll work if you're in the neighborhood and are really craving dumplings. I do enjoy that the pan-fried ones are crispy and lightly charred on one side without the whole thing being fried and hardened to oblivion.The dumplings of the month, chicken with green mole sauce, actually tasted more like pork or chorizo. The ingredients sounded so interesting and inventive, but everything became one giant mush of singular flavor; nothing stood out. The pan-fried reinvented classic was pretty tasty. I also liked the garlic crushed cucumber salad, but you can't really go wrong with that.When I went, they served an unsweetened blueberry iced tea and a sweetened lemonade, but I was able to mix both to basically create a blueberry Arnold Palmer. A little too sweet for me, so not as refreshing, but I bet the unsweetened blueberry iced tea by itself would be great."
2134,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,9/11/2021,2 star rating,"I don't know what to say - the dumplings here are just not good. I've tried both the chicken and pork and as a Chinese person who has eaten plenty of dumplings, these were just not good. The fillings were too mushy in texture and mediocre flavor in flavor, comparable or even worse than the frozen bagged ones you can get at any Asian grocery store, only these cost 12$ for just 6."
2135,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,3/27/2022,5 star rating,Mimi Cheng's is a wonderful innovative dumpling spot that has a great variety. It's great for a quick bite and reliable every time.
2136,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,2/10/2020,3 star rating,"This review applies to both locations. I've visited each location twice; my first time at leach location I had the monthly special and one of the dumplings from the regular menu. The monthly specials are always really good, but I do not like the dumplings from the regular menu.... the last two times I've stopped by, I just got an order of the monthly special and then went somewhere nearby for dessert. The sides are ok, but are very pricey. The dumplings are actually pretty pricey too. It's fun to watch them being handmade up at the front, and their house dipping sauce is fantastic, but I can't really recommend anything other than the monthly special. My favorite monthly was the Emmy burger collaboration! I wish all the dumplings were like this. Â The buratta meatball dumplings were also really good, and the lunar new year lamb dumplings were amazing. This month there is a French onion soup dimpling and I'd like to try that. So again, the specials are fun, interesting, and delicious, but you're better off going to Chinatown if you want high quality pork or veggie dumplings and you'll get them there for cheaper."

Sooooo gooodddddd, I wish I could have them at this exact second. We also snagged the housemade lemonade, a tad bit too sweet for me, but you can do half and half of that with the housemade unsweetened blueberry. Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuum"
2138,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,11/16/2020,4 star rating,This was a cute little spot to grab a quick bite! I thought the sauce was the best part. Got the dumplings (half fried half not) and the noodles. Cant go wrong with either and worth it considering the price point.

There's nothing out of the ordinary, nor special. I appreciate the consistency when I do have breakfast here, no tummy complaints so that's a great feat in and of itself for diner style restaurants. I''m always wary. Typical large menu, diner style service and food portions. The interior is definitely showing wear, tables and seats not the most stable so here's to hoping those things will be addressed sooner than later. I recommend simply for the nice service and consistently good breakfast if you're in the area."

Place is really starting to show wear though. The booths were starting to rip and were covered with duct tape. Really unappealing sight. They have a large selection of breakfast and lunch items. Many different pancake varieties from red velvet to cake batter. As well as waffles and crepes. I ordered the ""make your own breakfast"" which was a choice of pancakes , waffles, or crepes , 2 eggs any style , 2 bacon or sausage, and a hash brown for around 10$ which I thought was reasonable. I got the strawberry crepes which were lackluster in flavor and doughy. Wouldn't get it again. I also ordered the vanilla coffee which was good but sadly it didn't come with free refills.Overall a decent brunch. But they can definitely revamp the restaurant and use higher quality ingredients."
2142,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,2/14/2021,1 star rating,I honestly am so beyond pissed off with this restaurant and want management to contact me. I used to have good things to say but no more. I try to call countless times and no one answers the phone so I order online and they forget half my order that I PAID FOR. And trying to get it is mission impossible I drive all the way home to have my things missing and I'm annoyed. They need a better system or more staff. Horrible

As you can see i coudnt even make it through the omelette.. For the price they have the audacity to charge you could go to a nice diner or restaurant and actually get edible food. Im sorry but yall need to step ya game up in the food department. But hey, at least now i know. Just passing along the information."

Well, food took forever even tho there was practically NO ONE THERE. Â Maybe 5 tables total. Cheap plastic silverware. I have more substantial plastic silverware at my house. Ridiculous. Servicer was delightful. Happy, Easy going, got the order. But can't say the same for the cook. We were 4 adults and 3 orders came out to the table after a bit of a wait and the 4th didn't come out until the other 3 were DONE EATING. Â Don't know what the problem is but they better get better at this. No excuse. I went to Denny's in New Jersey and it was a much better situation. Get with it IHOP!!!!"

Unfortunately we could not find a parking space so we have to park across the street. I would definitely suggest a bigger parking lot in the future. It was packed inside of the restaurant but because it was just a friend and I and we were called right away which was a plus. Our area was clean and the food was great. The buttermilk pancakes never fail. They are delicious, fresh and melts in your mouth. My steak omelet was amazing. The portions were large and I was beyond full. I had to obtain a to go box for the rest of my food. The coffee was freshly Â brewed and was very good. The waitress would continue to come to our table to make sure we were satisfied. I don't have any complaints about this place the waitress was very very nice and the service was delightful."
2148,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,5/5/2019,1 star rating,"Service as far as our waitress was decent...this is why I give it one star.- Waited 45+ mins for food...and even then it came out in sections. Grits came 15 mins before the rest of the food...one breakfast entree was still missing, now everything was cold. Our avocado (ordered on the side) was hard as an uncooked potato. Asked if they could warm the grits up (as they were cold by then), they brought out a bowl of sloppy soup grits 10 mins later. Still waited for missing chicken/waffle entree. - Asked to speak to a manager, they sent over another waiter. Asked again to speak to a Manager, finally Kimberly comes over. We explained that the quality of the food as well as the timing was poor. We also explained that our waitress was pleasant, and we aren't complaining about her or putting her at fault. Before the manager would even offer an apology, she said ""No it's her fault, she decides when the food comes out"". We explained to the manager that the waitress is NOT in charge of the quality of food that comes from the kitchen. Manager offered to make food all over again, but after waiting now over 45+ min, we opted to leave. I am a hospitality manager myself, regardless who's fault it is, you NEVER throw your employees under the bus like that. A good manager should always take responsibility and deal with the issue after the customer has been taken care of. Seems kind of shady, hence forth we won't return to this location again."

Has ample seating in the back and is cash only. A bit dingy but it appeared relatively clean. Not a place I'd advertise for great pizza. Also had garlic knots. They were a bit burnt on the bottom. I should have guessed that would happen because another customer told them not to leave their knots in the oven too long. Flavor of the knots were better than my pizza, minus the burnt parts. The only really good thing about this place was the price, although pizza prices have been going up in general, their prices are pretty reasonable."

Spice level could have been higher, but the flavor and crispiness were fantastic. For the main course, ordered the Kadai Paneer Masala ($16) - a hearty curry with paneer, onions, tomatoes and a good kick of spice. I like that the dish comes with rice, as to have a vehicle to eat the curry.Service here is solid despite only one guy working the tables. Lots of options to come for multiple trips."

Very impressed by overall cleanliness, attention to service.I had samosa yesterday and since it was good I went back today. Maybe it's too early in the season for Idlis, but I was greedy since I was told that the chef is from Bangalore. Idlis came undercooked. They took it back to the kitchen did something to it and brought it back a little better. First, hygienically not the right thing to do. You should not put half eaten food to reheat with fresh food. It should be disposed of and a fresh plate made, to the best of my understanding.There were crumbs on the velvet sofas on either side. Indian food is messy and they need to give a little more detail to cleaning after customers. I'm going to give the restaurant one more shot - this time go with the safe bet, north Indian food."

This is my favourite drink and I order it quite frequently. However, I believe that during this particular visit, the ratio of ""3J"" to actual milk tea was not a good ratio--there was far too little milk tea. Other than that though, I would definitely visit this location again (but I would be a little wary about the earl grey milk tea with 3J)!"

Their selection of drinks is relatively limited to what I'm used to seeing at most other Boba spots.I got the strawberry green tea with 30% sugar, but it still seemed sweeter. Maybe bc of the strawberry preserves? The bits of strawberry in it were yummy. But maybe I'd get no sugar next time, since it's already in there.

(She then said something to her coworker along the lines of ""she was going to ask about the whole menu,"" which sounded like it was about me--not very nice, but maybe she had to justify it?)I decided against the white pearls as they weren't chewy and were more like nata jelly and got passionfruit green tea with 30% sugar, less ice, and bubbles. It was quite good, but I don't think it was well mixed. I got a really sweet mouthful of syrup at maybe my third sip and then swirled the straw around to mix the tea, but my drink was considerably less sweet and flavorful after. I guess the teas aren't really mixed here, so be sure to shake your drink before putting in the straw!"

I ordered a tea at the register and got an answer to my question. The rude girl put down her drink and she actually made the drink I ordered. Gratefully, my Brown Sugar Milk Tea was good; better than the one that I had at the location near 110st. But for the service and that girl's attitude, I'm giving this review a 2. I won't be back at this location I'll be going to the others much closer to home."

Food was very good, service also very good, wasn't to busy on a Tuesday evening but just enough for good atmosphere. We had the fixed dinner menu that had some good choices available for the $59.00 fee. Sweet & Smokey pork chop was huge, the Salmon was also very good. A great little restaurant within walking distance from Times Square. Decent wine & cocktail list at typical NYC prices, half bottle of Chianti Riserva $37.. I'll return ."

They were unfortunately out of our choice but the replacement was nice. Two of the party chose the pre fixe menu. They both had the mushroom risotto to start then the filet. They said they were amazing. I had the special bass dish. Salty mushroom jus with perfectly prepared fish. So good! Another had the quinoa paella. Also delicious. I enjoyed the kale Caesar as well. We finished off the evening with bread pudding, sorbet, panna cotta and chocolate cake. All of the desserts are good but I loved the panna cotta the most. Our server was engaging and funny. He was overwhelmed to start as the theatre crowd was getting finished up but had more time with us later. Great atmosphere. I will return on my next trip."

Â A smidge apathetic and not super interested in our needs. Â That being said, the filet was cooked perfectly and was very tender. Â The garlic mashed that accompanied were great. Â I got the pear walnut salad and it was great as well! Wife had a daily special that included a very generous thick cut pork chop. It was cooked well except one side of the chop did not have the fat rendered. Â We had the lava cake with ice cream for dessert and it was a 5/5! Absolutely perfect. Â All in all nice spot for a before show meal. Â Cheers!"

The staff are Bangladeshi, and they have mostly Northern Indian and Bangladeshi food, served cafeteria-style. And the food is great! Besides saag paneer, we like the chicken curry, fish curry, daal, and chana masala. They also have delicious ready-made lassis. Prices are reasonable, and great for this part of town."
2210,btLgjl8CEgW2wvB0ZI-Aqg,2/19/2021,2 star rating,"This is one of many Indian/Bengali restaurants on the famous Curry Hill. I had high hopes because I thought it was going to be a mini Jackson Heights in Manhattan. I didn't even let the slightly trashy interior deter me because everyone knows the best Indian food can be found in the simplest of places. Plus I thought the name was hilarious and that alone gets a star!It's cafeteria style where you pick what you want from the trays and then take it out to eat. They do have a heated outdoor dining set up. The servers were very nice and were working hard getting everyone's orders. This place had advertisements for their chicken tikka on every wall but I was really craving curry so that's what I got instead. Maybe that was my first mistake...I got the chicken korma which wasn't on the trays in the front so they had to make it ""fresh."" It was very liquidy and tasted too much like cream instead of the actual flavors. I needed more flavor. The chicken was very soft. The plain basmati rice it came with was very good. I also ordered the chicken tikka masala based on presentation. At first glance, it looked delicious with its spicy red color and speckles of spice. It ended up tasting like the red version of the korma. No flavor at all. And the chicken was not good. Too soft and tasted off. I also got some chicken samosas which are sooo hard to mess up but this had to be one of the driest samosas I ever tried. Not even the dipping sauces could save it. This place just isn't worth it. There's a reason you can't hurry curry!"

Whenever I happen to be in the neighborhood, I make a point to stop by and get their Tikka Chicken Masala Combination platter to go! They have tables to eat at upstairs, but this is mainly a grab and go place. I'm not sure why this place doesn't have better reviews. Obviously, they must be doing something right or they wouldn't have lasted for more than 20 years there. Also, their Lentil Soup is THE best!!! I've tried a lot of Indian restaurants and always find myself comparing it to Curry In A Hurry. Prices are also very reasonable! I love this place!"

Â Not much paneer, either. Â And since you have to wait a while for them to heat up your dish, the ""in a hurry"" name doesn't even seem accurate. Â I suppose I should have known better given that there were absolutely no other customers at noon, but oh well, nothing ventured, nothing gained."
2213,btLgjl8CEgW2wvB0ZI-Aqg,10/4/2020,5 star rating,"When I was working on Park Avenue South last year, my colleague introduced Curry in a Hurry to me and my office BFF and this became our designated 'Indian' lunch spot. This quick and casual Indian spot has a bit of a cafeteria-style type of setting. It's not a fancy or fine dining type of setting, so don't expect much in decor. You order and pay on the first floor and second floor they have seating which is also where you'd wait for the food to come. I typically order their Biryani dish which is quite filling and tasty. I've also had their Naans which is tasty and delicious. Their food is truly Indian comfort food and the best part is that it's inexpensive. This was one probably one of my favorite lunch spots to come with my colleagues because there was always a place to sit, customer service is good, food is delicious and affordable, and just overall a good spot."
2214,btLgjl8CEgW2wvB0ZI-Aqg,10/8/2022,3 star rating,"I like the food. But depending who you get, the service doesn't make me want to come back. I ordered 4 samosas. Â I asked for sauce. All restaurants give one green and one red sauce with each samosa. I got one of each for four samosas. It was a woman server I never saw before. I did not feel like a valued customer. She didn't ask me how many I wanted. I asked for only red sauce she gave me both in tiny cups. Today I went to the Â Giant supermarket and bought but a variety of different meals made by deep Indian kitchen and I heated it up in the microwave. It came with so much sauce and I'll get that for now on. I think owners of restaurants should really make sure that their employees care about friendly good service."

CONS:- overpriced: Tiny portion for $8 (please see photo) - restroom: It was sub-par. I can't believe I am giving it a 4-star. The food was good though. I am sorry to place those two sentences next to each other. IMPRESSION:Overall, this spot is cool. I have been here 3 times. It can be a bit grungy. But, this is definitely something you can only experience in New York. I would even classify it as a New-York experience. (Although the price for this was a total of $8, I used an app that significantly decreases this price. Please see photo for my referral link; that will give you $10 for free to start with also and gives me 1,000 pts.)."

Honestly after reading other reviews about the curry there is a slight truth in it. However! It still tasted good and was a good portion. If I had to say anything though, you HAVE to get the Samosa it's like one of the best we've ever had it was amazing, immaculate and so so tasty. On top of that I give it 4 stars also for how nice the service was and accommodating. They really pile you up with food and gave us a couple samples of things. Overall super kind people and a VERY New York establishment. Will definitely be returning for one of the Samosas for sure."

I love it every single time. It's more food than I can eat in one sitting, so I end up with lunch for the next day as well when I buy it for dinner. It comes with rice as well of course. My mom and sister love the food too, and they are enamored by the samosas. All of the food is sold at a great price, especially considering how good it is and that it is Indian food and NYC. Have been here many times and cannot wait to return. Highly recommend."

Â When Curry is on point, it is amazing. Â The chicken is delicious and so is their naan (which has always been served hot and fresh to me). Â Additionally, Curry will give very generous portions of food, enough so to make another meal out of it. Â There is an occasional visit where something is a little off flavor wise, but it's definitely infrequent enough that I will continue to keep coming back. Â I highly recommend Curry in a Hurry"

Â I was greeted right away and decided to sit at the bar. It was pretty empty only about 2 other tables. Happy hour was going on and they had lunch specials. I got a $5 prosecco with elderflower concoction it was good. For lunch I ordered drunken noodles with vegetables $9.50. You get a complimentary appetizer when you order an entree. Sweet! I got the vegetable dumplings. The food came out very fast.Dumplings were very flavorful and full of vegetables. Â The cons were they sat them in a pool of the ponzu sauce. While the sauce was good it was sweet and I didn't want my dumplings drowned in it. Also I'm assuming they make the wrapper fresh. Some parts were undercooked and doughy, others parts were overcooked and chewy and other parts were perfectly cooked. Someone needs to work on technique.The drunken noodles were absolutely delicious. Full of flavor with a nice heat and very well seasoned. The noodles were cooked perfectly. Ton of vegetables, carrots, celery, brÃ³coli, bell peppers, onions and haricot verts. It was a good portion too. I was only able to eat half. Overall the food was delicious, service was great and the price even better. If I'm ever hungry in the neighborhood again I'll definitely pop in. Would've gave 5 stars if the dumpling wrapper was better."

I wasnt impressed the first time I came, but the second time around I got the vegan mock duck (not a part of the lunch special) and I was way happier. If only they would put this on the lunch menu (even if there was a slight up charge for it)! Speaking of, the lunch special is great. It's ~$10.50 for an appetizer + lunch portion entree, and its definitely more than enough food. So if you get tired of dig inn and sweetgreen, 'Spice' is a more than worthy alternative."

Maybe more than half their drinks are about 40% off during happy hr ranging from 6-8$. So damn good. Their cocktails are creative and sweet. I had a passion fruit pina colada and a lychee martini. I preferred the martini because the colada wasn't a frozen one and it had a bit of a powdery texture. The lychee was definitely refreshing. I ordered the black noodles with shrimp. It was a large portion that came in a small bowl, don't be deceived. Â The noodles aren't actually black lol I think their sauce just made it a bit brown. The vegetables in the dish created a satisfying, crunchy texture, and the shrimp was very savory. I would definitely order it again but there are so many other things I want to try. I would highly recommend getting noodles instead of ice. Also, the spice calamari was delicious !I will definitely be coming back here whether it's for food or drinks!"

I called the place at 6:45pm i get there at 7:30pm &* its not ready. I still had to wait in line even thou i was told i didn't have to. Oh my goodness i never seen a cashier who rolled her neck soo much. Surprisingly it didnt fall off. Gave me all kinds of attitude. Sorry i had to let her have it. I love the food but not enough to come back again

We called the same day and let them know what happened. They claimed they would give us shrimp with our order the next time we came. When my husband went today, they said they needed the receipt. Then they offered to give him two orders with shrimp at no extra cost as if they were doing him a favor. He said he wanted what he paid for but they refused. Horrible customer service and bad business in general. They should have had more class. We'll wait until we go to the mall. The food is better there anyway. We will never frequent this location again."

The dining room is pretty spacious yet it felt warm on a very cold night. The staff allowed us to sit anywhere we liked. We chose a spot with a little distance from everyone else (Covid-19 still being a thing). Table service was pretty efficient and pleasant (major keys for hungry people). I remember having a tamarind margarita. It was my first and I'm not sure that I've even seen in on a Mexican menu as a margarita before. It was good, for the record! For my entree I went big with the ""Plato Don,"" a platter served with rice, beans, guacamole, pico de gallo, queso fresco, soft tortillas, roasted vegetables, and corn. As if that wasn't enough, I added some shrimp to the thing. I couldn't finish it all but I regret nothing! It was all hot, tasty and satisfying!If you're in the vicinity, looking for heavy eats, during late night hours, Chavela's is an excellent option."

When I asked what was gluten free they told me that pretty much everything on the menu was, other than the battered fish tacos and the mole sauce which were both made with breadcrumbs.The food came out quickly and the tacos were definitely a fair size that 3 was enough for me for lunch, although maybe next time I would order 4. The flavors were good, although not quite as amazing as some tacos I had when I visited Mexico recently, but by Brooklyn standards definitely some of the better ones you can find."

The tables were pretty spaced out which I appreciated. The hour happy was stellar. The tacos are not some measly bite, these are loaded tacos- packed with meat. Even the margaritas on happy hour were in tall glasses. They don't give the traditional NYC serving sizes which I love. The only weird moment was a tequila shot request and they gave us a pretty uninspiring tequila."

Maybe it's something about their cozy interior, or that quality Mexican fare can be hard to come by in New York. My friend says this restaurant tastes a lot like her Mexican mother's cooking, which is a ringing endorsement if I've ever heard one. I lucked out on the last two top available on a Saturday night and we gladly scooped it up.We found that our server didn't know the menu too well, but that's what obsessively reading Yelp reviews is for, isn't it? I was happy with the taquitos de cangrejo as a starter, and a little lukewarm about my camarones a la mexicana. The portions were okay and shrimp were succulent, but the rice it came with was somewhat bland. I doused it in hot sauce. I wish I hadn't just emerged from a heavy drinking week because I would've indulged in their extensive mezcal selection.Brunch seems to be a winner here and I'd be willing to return to try their smoked trout guacamole or huevos rancheros."
2258,hh2T5aLJsSjpHvPRcQxIJw,1/19/2022,4 star rating,Tasty Mexican place with nice decorations inside. A bit too loud for my liking but that's probably just me. I would suggest outdoor seating if you can since its pretty protected from the weather and a bit more intimate. For apps we had the taquitos de cangrejo which was really crispy and filled with crab meat inside. They're small but really tasty.Had the Plato don which was pretty fun to build your own tacos. They give you enough food to feed 2 people but you might want to order another order of tortillas (which come out super hot).We came here on a Wednesday night and it seemed pretty busy so might be good decision to try to make reservations on a busier day.

While going to the car I saw Tipp inn I thought "" nice name"" so I came inside. They accommodateed me by turning up the tv I was sitting in front of. If you want a sports bar this is not the place. But if all the sports bars are crowded or playing rock then come to Tipp Inn. Nice decor. The bartender is friendly and serves a great jack n ginger (attention girls that's a real man's drink) lol.

You have to share table with others. Some customers didn't know that. Â Great food, dim sum. Â Good inexpensive coffee. Â If the items you wanted are sold out, you can order them made fresh, before 12pm, Â such as dried shrimp rice noodle roll.

The baked goods is displayed on the left and the seating is to the right. Four or five wooden tables seat about four each, although most people take their dim sum to go. You shout to the ladies in Cantonese what you want, and they displace the dim sum off the ceramic white plate into a small Styrofoam box. After you finish your order, they total your bill. Cash only like most Chinese stores and grocers. Most of the dim sum here is better than other bakeries in the Bensonhurst area. We usually order their gow choy buns, haw chuen, beef balls with cilantro, and steamed pork buns. Their consistency is better than most dim sum places, in that the gow choy buns are usually crisp on the outside with a generous portion of shrimp and gow chow, their beef balls are usually large (2inches in diameter) and their pork buns are fresh. Of course we have had the contrary but as their overall performance remains the same, we will be back."

Whatever. The people working there were not pissed that everyone had coupons. I mean who doesn't like a good deal.. It didn't take that long even with the massive line. So we got 2 chickens, creamed spinach and sweet potato thing that my brother recommended. The chicken was actually very moist & juicy, but it was too soft. It wasn't too salty. The creamed spinach was okay. It's never going to be as good as a sit down restaurant. It waI did not care for the sweet potato casserole. It didn't have any texture except for the pieces of brown sugar streusel. Really mushy, but too liquidy for me but L enjoyed it since it's very sweet."

The corn and potatoes were cold and also inendated with the putrid smell of rancid beef. Both dinners were tossed cuz if eaten would have sent me and my father to the hospital.

Â The food seemed fresh, the service seemed friendly and the decor seemed tasteful and homely. Â Fast forward to 2009. Â I spent one of the worst Thanksgiving ever alone at a Boston Market in Sunnyside, Queens eating a rather ""meh"" turkey platter.

Â You had one bad OkCupid blind date too many, you need that one statistics class to graduate and you dropped it 3 times already, and your boss just quit. Â The turkey was dry despite the gravy, and they forgot the cranberry sauce. Â The restaurant is packed with people and some woman asked me for the sixth time whether I am done yet. It wasn't great. Â For the past 9 years I promised myself to stay clear of Boston Market, not because there are inherent issues, it's more of a philosophical difference of opinion. Â The message from Boston Market is one of domestic conflict avoidance - too tired to cook and your spouse is the same? Â Pick up something and make the issue go away. Â Got no appreciable kitchen skills? Â It's okay, we'll take care of it. Â Got no place to make you feel at home? Â We got home cooked flavors, and you don't have to deal with leftovers. Â It's a weird value prop - it's priced like the local diner but minus the local small business support, and the food ranges from decent to phoning-it-in mediocre. Â So what bought me in? Â Oh, the limited time dinner prime rib. Â So, what about this location in Forest Hills, only steps away fron the prestigious ""gardens""? Â Well, more of the same. Â It's a small space with upstairs dining (no elevator so consider the downstairs space reserved for the handicapped). Â The food is a simulacrum of slow home cooked meals. Â Take for instance my prime rib - it's covered with a salt rub (probably an analog of Lawry's seasoning salt) and then supposedly roasted in their rotisserie (I kinda doubt it, they were carving it to the side) and served warm, but without au jus or the horseradish sauce. Â Honestly, I could've picked up a standing rib from Costco, sous-vide it, finish it with my culinary torch and then get better results, but I am in no mood for that at the moment - its prime rib time. Â The big disaster for the evening was my wife's rotisserie chicken pot pie, which was...eh, how do I put this? Â The pie crust has a lid and a bottom, but no walls. Â What, did the president requisition it to build that freaking Mexican fence? Â The results were limp, soggy, and oversalted. Â The chicken tasted stale, and the carrots and peas were large unwieldy lumps on top of roof-shingle-like fragments of crust.So overall, no thanks. Â Given a little time investment and knowhow I can run culinary circles around these fools. Â They are probably a restaurant-of-last-resorts if you torched your kitchen and your culinary skills are more akin to Hannibal Lecter than Jamie Oliver, but for those who can cook, I would reserve this place as utility-food-for-emergencies."

I think there were more people than usual working because of this event, but in spite of that, not a single person said hello to me. Three of the people who seemed to be working were standing in the middle of the store, deep in conversation with each other, to the extent that I had to say ""excuse me"" to one of them so that I could pass her and keep browsing. Would have been the perfect time for her to say ""Sorry, and hello! anything I can help you with?"" or something like that, but she just stepped aside and kept gabbing. Once I got to the back, there was a tarot card reader and a customer at one table, and someone else making coffee, but again, no one bothered to acknowledge me. Some cute stuff in there, but I couldn't find prices on things like the candles, so I really don't know how much anything is, and I didn't feel like anyone there wanted to take my money. I went to Thistle & Clover and purchased things there instead and experienced awesome customer service."

Â For some reason I really like their ice coffee and that is what I get . Â I am able to just sit down and enjoy my ice coffee. Â This place is not Starbucks it has a lot more character and feels very comfortable. Â I normally come to Chinatown with other people but this is really my hideout when they go food shopping.

But there is a minimum) Me and my friend got a teapot to split and I got waffles with green tea ice cream. I loved the little serving cups for the tea. They are so dainty and small. The waffles was delicious and massive. I was pretty pleased to see lots of people studying here. Very quiet relaxed environment.One thing that bothered me was the restroom. It was so wet and cold. Kinda gave me the creeps. Aside from the bathroom situation, this place is great. Staff is nice and friendly. I'll return again."

So if you're planning to study and stay for a couple of hours or so, you can order hot loose tea leaves and you can always refill!The workers r nice and can recommend you the popular drinks and they have elines cheesecake for $4 which is sooo soft and delicate. I will definitely come back! Even though it looks small, Theres enough seating that you'll be able to find a seat soon enough. I had a lovely study session here and would come back! @eatsumbap"
2311,yvg56iLnpb2cDb1rCZrCUA,1/7/2019,2 star rating,"Came here with friends to catch up over coffee and was disappointed with both the drinks and the service.- Drinks: I ordered ""grapefruit"" from the ""Fresh Fruit"" section of their menu and what I got was not even remotely fresh grapefruit juice--definitely more along the lines of Tang (that orange powdered drink). Friends who ordered coffee were equally disappointed with their drinks. Based on previous reviews, I guess tea is their forte.- Service: Of my group of six people, five ordered drinks. After we sat down with our drinks, within 5 minutes, one of the staff members came over with a menu to ask the remaining person to order. Having just had lunch, the last member of our party politely declined. However, the staff member insisted that if he didn't order, we would all have to leave. I'd understand if only 1-3 members of our group ordered and we were taking up their space for a long time/loitering--but it felt unreasonable when we'd just sat down and 5/6 people ordered drinks."

I had already drank one from another tea place so I just sat there and waited for her to order. (This is based off my experience pre-covid). So as I fanned myself from the blistering summer heat, my friend placed her order and waited at a table. We were going to leave after she got her drink but instead the waiter comes over and hands us two menus. We told them that my friend ordered but the waiter said if me and my other friend didn't order we couldn't sit: As soon as my friend got her drink we immediately left. This place is a scam and unnecessarily rude. We were going to leave anyway. Plus the drink sucked and was a waste of money.

Add that they serve great tasting Italian Food and we found ourselves a winner ladies and gentlemen! The establishment is located in Williamsburg and it was recommended by a friend, so we agreed to meet there last night for dinner. I am always excited about Italian Food and this was my first time at Da Francesco....let's just say that I was ready to eat as I got closer to their front door -lol. Da Francesco is so pretty! The entrance along w/ front tables and seating, bar area, etc. are simply elegant. I was in awe of the indoor seating area that they have towards the back of the restaurant. There is also interesting art on the walls, writing on some of their wall mirrors, elaborate decor hanging from the ceiling, etc...My friend purchased a Groupon deal which was $35 for $60 worth of food! Such a fantastic Groupon deal! So, we ordered the Carciofi appetizer which is Braised Artichoke that had Garlic, Olive Oil and Parmigiano. We each ordered an entree- I had Spaghetti E Polpette (Spaghetti and Meatballs; my friend had Penne) my friend had a glass of white wine as well as coffee and we shared some Tiramisu for dessert. Delicious Meal! All staff and servers was so nice and attentive. The bill was $67.50 which was excellent for all of the items we ordered. Da Francesco is a place I would like to go to in the summertime to enjoy their food in the outdoor eating area."

Well, there I was waiting for my friend to arrive and I decided to go in. Clearly, from the outside of the place and the surrounding community, I can tell you this place has a great family restaurant feel. I walked in and was immediately greeted by who I assume was the owner or manager. I informed him that I was waiting for a friend and he invited me to have a seat at the bar. He even pulled out the seat for me. Â I order a Pinot Noir and the waitress offered me a small plate of Italian bread, salami and cheese. Needless to say, the customer service here is excellent.The restaurant has many sections. When you first arrive you will notice the vestibule seating area followed by the bar area. There is a main dining area and this is perhaps the best area Â of all. The dining area is quite beautiful with a very high ceiling and decorative layout. Believe me, you will find yourself looking up and around as you wait for your meal/drink order to be taken.So, my friend arrived and we were seated right away. The waiter did all the customary things to perfection. Â I had the special fish of the day and my friend had grilled lobster in the shell. We both enjoyed out meal immensely. The waiter made sure that everything was to our liking and struck the right balance in making sure we had everything we needed. I'm confident that I will be returning in the very near future to try the many delicious options on the menu, namely the spaghetti and meatballs and who doesn't love spaghetti and meatballs!"

To start,the food looks a lot better on yelp, very bland tasting dine in person with COVID protocols not being followed. There were red flags such as the stale bread served with mustard, the flies, someone saying this restaurant sucks when walking by but we decided to keep an open mind. We barely finished the food but paid the full bill/tipped to be courteous of the pandemic. We told the server how unsatisfied we were with the food but they honestly didn't budge.

I definitely will be back...perhaps later this week because all I could dream about last night were soft pillowy cheese raviolis. I purchased a Groupon ($30 for $60) for this date and it was satisfied to the full extent. I had two very kind waiters seat us and explain all the wines/food specials for the night. He also let us know upon seating that we could order whatever we wanted off the menu with no restrictions (major plus). They had an extensive wine menu and even better food menu. We weren't in much of a drinking mood since we were downing margaritas the night before so fortunately that made us just focus on food. My date ordered the lamb shank and couscous and I had two entrees: spaghetti and meatballs and raviolis. The meatballs and ravioli were phenomenal! I completely demolished my raviolis in a few bites; they were so good and the sauce was not too acidic. I know spaghetti and meatballs seems a little basic at an Italian restaurant but I assure you there was nothing basic about this entrÃ©e. My waiter came to spoon Parmesan over my two plates and I asked him if he could leave the cheese at the table with me and he giggled in understanding lol!Let me not forget to talk about the lamb shank. It was cooked for hours to the point it was practically falling off the bone. It was seasoned to perfection and it was huge! My date couldn't stop talking about his lamb the entire drive back home. It gets better... so its been hours after dinner and were laying in bed and he starts talking about how amazing his lamb was all over again. I'm like okay I get it, I was there too and yes it was good. He continues "" Ash you don't understand the moment my fork touched the lamb etc etc etc."" He is so annoying but he's so right, that lamb was everything and more. What's even more shocking is that the lamb shank entrÃ©e was only $22! Where do you even find prices like that ? Our waiter had mentioned a grilled lamb chop option as well which we anticipate to try very soon.For dessert we shared my all time favorite ice cream in the whole wide world, a tartufo. I've had tons of tartufo in my life from all over the world and this one was pretty okay. Lets just say it was a good simple ending to a great meal. Also, the couscous was a bit strange to me it was kind of crunchy and had carrots in it. It didn't taste bad but it is something I'm not use to eating I suppose. Overall, we had a great time: the food, ambiance, and service was 5 stars. I definitely recommend!!"

Definitely more family oriented, than a young, modernized crowd. The staff was very attentive and knowledgeable. The food has great portions and the flavors did not disappoint. The mushroom risotto was delicious, but extremely filling so be prepared to share or to take some home. The raviolis and baked clams were perfect proportion. I would say the baked clams could be shared with two people per order. Definitely worth it to try!I would recommend this more with people of all age groups and if you're looking for a traditional, vintage Italian meal/atmosphere. The place was very warming and dimly lit for a wonderful relaxing dinner. Did not disappoint at all!"

I tried the calamari which had a tangy thai flavor. It was really Â good but so unexpected for an Italian restaurant. The baked clams were really tiny but I was told they were tasty. I could never get myself to try it. Don't know why. For our main course we ordered the lamb shank which came with potatoes and vegetables, grilled chicken breast with vegetables, shrimp risotto and a personal pizza. While we waited they served some chewy thick bread with some olive oil and pesto sauce (I believe) which was really good!I don't eat lamb, but I peeped over and it looked so appetizing. I was told the lamb was tender, flavorful and perfectly cooked. The potatoes were also very good too. This would be my first time trying risotto and I thought it was really good. I didn't know it has a soupy rice texture. My shrimp was not whole, but cut up into pieces. Shrimp in every bite. The pizza was a big hit. It had fresh basil and mozzarella with a touch of sauce. Eccellente!!To finish our meal we ordered cannolis and espressos all around (we always end our meals with espresso Ha Ha!) Â The espresso was excellent but those cannolis were a show shopper. It had a nice thick chocolate coating and the filling was phenomenal. We had a great meal here and it wasn't too expensive for six guests. The staff was great, the place is intimate yet spacious and the bathrooms were clean. Â I would eat here again."

I had the Jerk Chicken - which is gluten free - For $5 you get a ""side"" portion but its a really good portion for the price. Fruit Chow - chow is something very regional to the caribbean and trinidad - it was great to have a nice seasonal chow with all of the traditional flavors without having to do the work myself. PearDrax - another Caribbean item - it's kind of like sparkling pear juice but...there is a distinct ""taste"" - its either you like it a lot or you don't. Give it a try.

They offered different sauces and I opted for the hot mango one if my memory serves me correctly. Anyway, those wings were on point!!!! A nice crunch, with sweet and spicy flavor. I was fully satisfied and find myself comparing other wings to Picky! It's been a couple of months but I still remember them. I can't wait to get them again and try something else in the menu.

They give generous samples before you place your order. Nice variety of flavors but not so many as to be overwhelming. I tried the Nutella, hazelnut and cappuccino. All were good but I went with the hazelnut in a small cup for 4 bucks. Very good quality gelato, smooth and creamy without any of those pesky ice pieces I always find when I get gelato at other spots.There are no fancy toppings here but this gelato doesn't need them. It's good enough to stand on its own."

I thought I was having gelato for the mood at this place, not for the taste. But since the taste was even worse than my already lowered expectation, it ended up ruining the mood When I asked for a spoon of capuccino gelato for tasting, there wasn't a hint of capuccino there. I tried to give it a second try and tasted oreo gelato, and it didn't taste like oreo either. I wanted to cancel my order but it was too late because you pay in advance at this place. I went for fruit flavors, wishing that they were different... but no... so I've tried 4 flavors and all of them tasted sort of greasy. (how?) Staffs are not really welcoming either."

It was only sauce on luke-warm, thin pizza dough with uncooked peppers-Also ordered the stromboli:Problem: NONE it was actually perfectly made, warmed better than my slice, flavorful, filling, enjoyed the salsa sauce with it.Biggest problem?? the total price for the specialty pizza slice and the stromboli was $12!!If the pizza slice blew me away, it would've justified the high-end price but it didn't so I won't be back."

I contacted them immediately and they were very responsive and apologetic. They offered to immediately send a new order (7 dozen) on the next business day, yesterday. The new shipment arrived today and we are extremely happy.Look, sometimes you have a business with a great product but they don't have any interest in the customer beyond that, think the ""Soup Nazi"" from Seinfeld.

A pleasant surprise and a place I know I will be back, because the food is simple, yet so delicious.Quality: Baba's Pierogies is just a great little spot. They absolutely do pierogies right and no matter which you order, you will leave happy. We stuck with boiled, which I prefer over pan fried, and selected Baba's Potato, Potato & Cheese, and Bacon Cheddar. I think my favorite of the bunch was the Potato & Cheese, which has a little sweetness, but the Bacon Cheddar was awesome as well. The true surprise however was the Kielbasy Sliders. Four sliders of kielbasa, cheese, sauerkraut, and mustard on brioche buns. It is a good way to break up the pierogies and the kielbasa was phenomenal. We didn't have room this time, but next time I want to try the dessert pierogies.Quantity: It is easy to go overboard on the pierogies, but I think our order was pretty good for two.Value: $9-$11 for orders of 5 Pierogies. $13 for the Kielbasy Sliders.Ambiance: Baba's Pierogies is located in the Gowanus area of Brooklyn. It is just a tiny shop, that really seems more setup for take-out. They have a small sheltered outdoor area, and then two tables open inside. Even at full capacity it is hard to imagine many more seats opening up inside. The key element of decor inside is two painted maps of Europe covered with pictures of the owner's grandma, the inspiration for the pierogies. It is a unique tribute and shows the care put into the food and the tradition there.Crowd: They only have two tables inside, and just a few more outside. However, during our short visit there was four orders picked up to-go.Service: They have a very small space, so they have added extra barriers to make it clear where you stand and wait. Unfortunately that was still not enough for some rude guests who clearly haven't been paying attention over the last year.Parking: A fair amount of spots right out front."

My boyfriend sat at a bench while I read the menu and thought of what to order TO-GO until the waiter came back from his car, or whatever...Can't say it looked authentic Polish (Jalapeno pierogi?)Waiter comes back in and scolds me like a child for even reading the menu where I stood... or for existing, it seemed. He nearly shoved us out the door in telling us to read a tiny-menu in a cramped hallway. Super disappointing, but probably can't expect better in a neighborhood like Gowanus, which is overrun by unwelcoming transplants likely getting some sort of poisoning from the toxic fumes which makes them very unsavory.

We ended up choosing 2 orders of the 5 pierogies, so we could eat 5 pierogies each. We tried the mac and cheese flavor as well as the jalapeÃ±o flavor with their special sauce, which was similar to sriracha mayonnaise. The mac and cheese one was my particular favorite. Pan-fried dough and mac and cheese - what else could I have asked for? It's a simple flavor but delicious nonetheless. The jalapeÃ±o one was my fiancÃ©'s favorite. This has more flavor due to the jalapeÃ±o flavoring present along with the cheese and potatoes. Both paired well with their special sauce, which we recommend especially as it costs only $1! Eating at Baba's was a wonderful experience and the staff members are so kind as well! I am glad we finally tried out Baba's!"

I'm not sure what happened to the dough or during the cooking process but something went awfully wrong. My grilled chicken was fine though it was not what that showed as a picture on seamless.

The chicken was raw in some places because it was not cleaned properly and the wrap was soaking of some type of white sauce. The drippings of the wrap fell on my work pants. I lost my appetite and didn't eat the other half of the wrap. I had to throw it away. The tamales ARE good. So if you order them, you will be playing it safe.

2386,vec8jeVbbSGzVlStl0Xp_Q,11/9/2016,4 star rating,"There are SO MANY drink places now that the line between certain drinks get blurred (and ultimately, it doesn't matter too much). Prices are pretty fair, though compared to all the other bubble tea places, this is on the slightly more expensive side along with its pricier counterparts ChaTime, TenRen, and Coco Fresh Tea & Juice.Though I'm an avid Yelper and foodie, I find that generally when I find good things at a place, I will stick to ordering that. In terms of red bean with milk and bubbles, Coco's is better, because their milk is lighter. I do have to give Kung Fu Tea props for giving me so much red bean and bubbles (though that may be because they accidentally gave me bubble milk tea instead at first!) As for the classic bubble milk tea, I personally think Kung Fu Tea's bubbles are the best. They're just the right amount of sweet, in contrast with the usually tasteless bubbles of other stores, and soft, yet chewy. The amount of sugar and amount of ice I want is never messed up like it does when I go to Yaya's. The Chinatown KFT is better tasting than this one though.EDIT: a lot of them don't have good English, so I tried to order Red Bean Wow Milk at ROOM temp (it's an option for ""ice level"") and the cashier put it as warm which is an extra $1. Then I said no, room temperature, and she changed it to that but size large (at the same price)."

The place is pretty small but it was clean. I got their regular milk tea 'cause I wanted to see if it tasted any different from the boba places in the Bay Area. My bf got the Oreo Milk Tea and he didn't like it at all haha. The Oreo wasn't mixed and it was just crumbs on top of the actual drink. I like how both our drinks actually tasted like tea instead of just all sugar and boba. Maybe that's also because I got 50% sugar. Their milk tea definitely tasted different but it was a good different. They also give you both black and white boba but they taste the same to me. It was more hard than chewy though. We both got regular and we drank it fast! Should have gotten large instead. Definitely will stop by again!

Â This boba tea business is a microscopic indoor booth and no standing room as it is designed for takeout only and sits in the vicinity of NYU campus. Â I agree with the poor customer service. Â Upon checking-in with Yelp mobile application a check-in offer for one free topping appeared and I shown my phone to the female cashier who did not know what to do and passed me to her colleague as I was like unwanted animate object. Â The brash young naÃ¯ve male server spent fifteen minutes attempting to decipher the Yelp check-in offer as he explained and instructed that I have to download their application and accumulate points to earn a free drink. Â Dude, my check-in offer is for one free topping with a purchase of a drink as I was NOT requesting for one free drink! Â The brash young naÃ¯ve dude then blurted out ""oh, I can't see!"" which he was wearing glasses or perhaps very limited in the English language especially written, a L.E.P. person, as a cover-up excuse and incompetent to take orders. Â Whoa, this naÃ¯ve male server held the line which further spewed outside the door for a longer wait as all I desired was one measly fruit tea drink $4.75 with a coupon for one free topping and lots of ice. Â Is this a very difficult drink order to take and fulfill? Â My experience and transaction was abject pain. Â Their toppings are very limited and awful as their nata mango jelly is hard, stale and very chewy sticky substance. Â I like grass jelly æ¶¼ç² (loeng4 fan2, liang2 fen3) as a topping option, but Kung Fu does not offer. Â This bubble tea business is chain operated but obviously does not conduct corporate training nor hire staff that is proficient in the English language. Â Orders are fulfilled by calling out order numbers as written on sales receipt.Yes, direct competition is within one block away with a long queue that wraps around as I can imagine orders are taken and fulfilled accurately without any issues.

Probably the best bubble tea I've had so far just on the strength of their KF Oolong Milk tea. Stacks up with my personal favorite, Sharetea, back home in California. Bubbles are nice and soft and, the oolong tea was flavorful. Can't ask for more and will definitely be back.Location is great. Just take it down the street to Washington Square Park and enjoy the fact that you're in one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Lastly, for all you credit card point churners, this location is CASH ONLY!"

2393,vec8jeVbbSGzVlStl0Xp_Q,3/26/2017,3 star rating,"I got a honey milk green tea at 50% sweetness with bubbles. It had a very interesting flavor, actually sort of a bit like the aftertaste of oolong tea you'd be served at a Chinese restaurant. Even with 50% sweetness I thought the drink was too sweet, but others may disagree. The boba was on the soft side, which I like, but there was nothing particularly special about the flavor.I also tried a lychee punch, which was great because it had real lychee pieces.Pretty average overall."
2394,vec8jeVbbSGzVlStl0Xp_Q,10/20/2019,4 star rating,"There are two boba stores on this one street: Kung Fu Tea, and Boba Guys, each with their own notoriety. Â I have tried Boba Guys, and recently I had the chance to try Kung Fu Tea, and after much thought, I prefer Kung Fu Tea.The location is very small, somehow even smaller than Boba Guys, but the actual shop is not where this place wins. At Boba Guys, I ordered a large drink for around 6 dollars. At KF Tea, it was only 4. In my opinion, the drinks are KF Tea are just right. I don't really like the especially sweet drinks, and this place delivers. At regular sugar levels, I could get some sweetness, while still having the tea flavor I've become addicted to. The bubbles were chewy and sweet, a perfect complement to the tea.This is the spot my dudes."

The people who pick up the phone actually understand what I want, get my orders correct and they are super friendly (they always remember our address and say hello now when we call). The food is actually really spectacular for Chinese take out. It is not greasy at all and fresh. I tried all the other Chinese take out in Ridgewood, and be far this is the best."

The order was delivered which was fast, but they only included 2 soy sauces and 2 duck sauces for the 2 meals, and only 1 Pepsi! They didn't even ask what type of soda I wanted, had the asked I would have gotten a diet Pepsi, but again for some reason only one was sent. My friend had gotten an upset stomach from the General Tso chicken also, so just a heads up. I got the chicken and broccoli combs and it was heavy on rice, light on chicken and broccoli and barely any sauce. So the extra soy sauce was critical but I had only one tiny packet. Luckily I had a bottle in the fridge and that saved the dry meal. Seems like the staff is cheep and tries to cut corners."

2408,rQp8ve1NiDted89b_sIq8g,4/27/2017,1 star rating,Only reason why this place is open is because of the hospital next door. Otherwise it's too overpriced and flavorless. Ordered a buffalo chicken panini. Where was the blue cheese they said that comes with it? Chicken definitely tasted old. At least let me know it was cooked 3-4 days before so I could order something else.
2409,rQp8ve1NiDted89b_sIq8g,2/12/2018,4 star rating,I've had their burgers and love them. You ask for medium rare and that's what you get. They serve good food and they have a very friendly staff.
2410,rQp8ve1NiDted89b_sIq8g,1/3/2015,5 star rating,"I'm confused by these reviews. Maybe because I've only ordered good/healthy things from here, and stayed away from their grill/sandwiches? But this is my go-to place for tasty, healthy food items during my visits to the hospital (once every 3 months on average). So far every healthy thing I've ordered from the buffet was clean, satisfying and filling. Items I've tried and can recommend: - spinach & honey mustard chicken - chicken fingers (with honey mustard sauce on side) - bean salad- avocado salad Like are y'all that are saying ""expensive and unhealthy"" just ordering the unhealthy things from here and then bitching about it? Also, NO panini I've had from ANY deli has EVER been good. Ever. Historically. It's a given. So I never bothered ordering those. Also, service has always been kind. These dudes seem to work 24 hour days (at the least, 12 -- the same 4 faces every time). How does one not look exhausted and stressed? But they've taken my weird requests with a smile. Eg: -""hey is that grapefruit only for juicing? Okay well can I buy one? Ummmm can you cut it into fours for me because I don't have a knife?"" They did that for me 4 days in a row with a smile.There's a ton of healthy options here. In fact, this is the ONLY healthy option I see by the hospital when in need nutrients to counter the stress. High quality Greek yogurt, tea, fresh fruits (bananas, grapefruit), lots of veggie-based options in their buffet. And their buffet food is fresh and good. Calm down, cranky people."

It has become an over-run, crowded cafe with hit or miss service and frequently dirty tables. There are too many tables crammed into their enclosed winter ""sidewalk seating"" and the inside seating is loud, trampled over by those in line to order and just down right unpleasant. The decline seems to correlate with the opening of their second location a few blocks away. It seems the new location has taken priority over this original location. No longer worth the premium charged for their menu items."

The coffee was rather excellent. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the pastries definitely were not fresh. The place got very busy in the short time we were there. Most of the purchase seemed to be take out orders of sandwiches and savory goods, not the sweets! Good for a quick bite or a warm drink."

My friend and I each got a coffee and shared a few pastries. The Trilogy was my favorite, a mix of chocolates in an almost cheesecake like texture and richness. The Tiramisu was great too and wasn't too sweet. The Lemon Meringue Tart had a great citrus flavor, the crust was great too. Great little cafe to visit!"

They have outdoor seating where you can enjoy your coffee for a bit before going on with your day. They are also open later than most coffee shops!

I'm not asked for ID when I'm buying thousands of dollars of stuff, but okay. I sat at the bar and waited for my well done burger, where I noticed ppl dining in weren't asked for ID, why was I? I also have never been asked for an ID at any dine in restaurant ever. Next I saw other black women come in and they were asked for vaccination cards and ID. The lady taking orders made a big deal about seeing them together. Then a white couple came in, flashed their vaccination cards and were seated. Hmmm why weren't they scrutinized the same way? This felt like a microagression towards the black women in the restaurant, myself included.Also I ordered a well done burger, when I got home it was medium rare inside. I wanted to go back so bad, but it's a 15 minute walk.Hopefully the staff is trained to treat all people the same."

Our first visit, we arrived in the last hour they were open and they still accommodated us for dinner although their kitchen was about to close. I felt that was a nice touch. Really digged their modern and retro decor. I also appreciate how spacious it is. They don't have an extensive menu. Most of their dishes are very simply made, like 4-5 ingredients max. For dinner, we shared the tomato salad which was more like a deconstructed BLT. The vegetable fricasse (ragout and egg noddles) offered in the summer was light and wonderful. My husband liked the Pork shoulder steak with buttermilk kimchi. Brunch: we had the mushroom on toast and pork hash. Their dishes come in great presentation. It could just be only the plates i tried but I felt they could do better infusing more flavor in their dishes. The star experience in my opinion is getting a drink here. The large gorgeous bar creates a cozy speakeasy feel. This place strikes as a great date spot. Drinks are well presented and made. Even the simple mimosas served at brunch. I liked the tequila and gin based drinks. The Mezcal margarita and the Eastside with cucumber and mint both stood out. Overall: 4 stars for drinks, atmosphere, service.3 stars for food. Need improvement in flavor department."

It was guy playing the saxophone, the music was cool. The bartender was a magician. He put on a show making drinks, I loved it. They give you pita bread with some sort of dip, it was ok, the plantains with the avocado crÃ¨me was delicious. I saved the crÃ¨me for my fries. The fried shrimp was fried to perfection and a good portion. The chicken sandwich was huge and delicious. The drinks were great. I loved the idea of ordering on an app. I didn't have to wait for staff to come by to add or to change items. The food came out pretty quickly. We met the owner, he was pleasantly and friendly. We also met the person who made the menu, I even suggested that the crÃ¨me should go with the fries. We laughed about how it could go with anything really, I would definitely return."

The space has a cool nouveau diner feel: wood slat benches, low hanging ceiling lamps, tons of bar seating (with hooks for your bag!), an open kitchen, and sweet oldies playing in the background. The service so far has been attentive and the drinks are tasty. I'm a huge fan of the Eastside, a gin cocktail with cucumber and mint. Super refreshing and smooth. I'll be back soon!"

Here is my list:1. prices are reasonable for the area which is a plus when feeding many. 2. service is great. I order via email and Jesus the manager gets back to me within 24 hours. He gives me a quote and sets up everything via email which for me is a plus. 3. Last year I had an event I did for the first time. After the event, I made some notes for improvements that I shared with Jesus for this year's event. He came through on every single request. It made my event even better than last! 4. They don't just delivery but they deliver and set up your event in a professional way. They clean up boxes, and papers after they leave. Juice and waters are set up and organized. This should be a standard but is not always done with some catering places. 5. Food is always good, fresh and displayed beautifully. I can't say enough about my experience with Franco's deli. Don't just grab a sandwich but consider them for catering. Top notch service and delicious good. You can't ask for more!"

I do believe that Cali has the best tacos. In my search for my taco fix, I found Essex Taqueria which was a few blocks from my apartment.I'm a taco man, so I ordered two tacos. I was sad that they didn't have corn tortillas. I love street tacos that are made with just meat, onions, and cilantro. They put lettuce on my tacos which I despise. The asada and adobada were both okay. Nothing to run home about. Service was a little slow and I was the only one there at that time. I wouldn't recommend if you want something quick. Their horchata was okay as well. Their salsa had a good kick which I appreciated as well. I don't think I will be a repeat customer. I hope I can find a good taco place in NY soon!"

2451,h7zUbQHTcCDHGY1jdyT8hg,7/18/2018,4 star rating,"Solid. Flavor. Texture. Heaven. Try their salsa, their salad, even their fish. Basic, though generous, ordering system with fresh ingredients. Always add some lime. It makes everything better!The place is very small, but they make the best use of the space. About two tables and some high tops. Â They also offer mexican sodas and fresh juices like horchata, yum! Pay cash or credit! The line gets pretty long so come with an idea of what you want to eat. Bowl/Burrito, tacos, quesadillas and typical sides like fries and rings are some of your options. Browse the artwork while you wait for your food. Your order is customized to your liking and cooked fresh. Si hablas espaÃ±ol es mucho mejor y facÃ­l."

Came here a few times and the burritos and quesadillas are delicious. The Â green salsa they have is fresh and delicious. Highly recommend the quesadilla if you're a quesadilla lover. And do expect to get messy bc the thing is usually cheesy and over flowing plus the salsa on top. Place is clean, not the biggest. Staff is friendly and will be glad to give you extra salsa if you want it. Highly recommend."

Been to this spot multiple times for takeout and the fish tacos ALWAYS hits the spot. Upon arriving you place your order first then when it's ready you get the chance to add toppings onto the tacos. I usually ask for lettuce, pico de gallo, corn and their spicy sauce. The service here is quick and it never disappoints.The interior is clean and they have beautifully tiled floors (yes, I have a thing with floors) which gives the place come character. This restaurant is located on a busy block and may be easily missed but if you're in the area and looking for a taco fix, this is your answer!"

After 1.5 hour wait, we were seated at a ""shared table."" This was a small 4 person table crushed into a corner that could barely fit 6 petite humans - the couple next to us needed to get out of their seats for us to exit and go to the bathroom (refer to photo). They had an extensive beer menu but ironically didn't carry any Thai beer (or any cocktails) - I guess it's a vibe? Beer arrived in cans with no glass (also part of vibe). My plate came dirty. Food was unique (they pride themselves on extremely spicy unique dishes) but given bare bones atmosphere was not worth it. Also weirdly no appetizers (like I said, bare-bones). Soothr prices without the service or atmosphere - don't recommend the trip."

Their salads are big portions and taste amazing.MAKE SURE YOU CAN TOLERATE SPICE!!!We thought we could handle their spice level but wow, it's the type of spice that lingers on your tongue but with the exception of flavorful! Make sure to have thai ice tea ready when you eat ! We had left overs for 3 plates, but we were able to take it out and eat it for the next day."

Came here on a Thursday evening and walked in with no wait around 6:30pm.I had read reviews that Ugly Baby was very spicy, and while it was a good level of spice, I definitely wouldn't call this unbearable. If you've at other spicy spots like Mala Project or Fish Cheeks, Ugly Baby isn't as spicy comparatively.All the dishes were great, though I probably wouldn't order the fried sea bream again (Pla Tod Kamin). The flavor of the skin was great, but the fish itself was pretty dry."

The dishes were quite spicy so if they tell you it's spicy, they mean it. With their current menu, there was only one vegetarian/vegan option but I loved it. The staff were all so friendly and nice/bubbly. Loved the energy & the bright decor scheme of orange/yellow! Cute, small & cozy!"

Some of the most authentic Thai dishes out there, and they have some serious heat too! While a little on the pricey side, I've never had an underwhelming dish. Also their beer selection is some of the best I've encountered at any restaurant (let alone Thai). Def great pairing with the super spicy dishes."
2459,XpgquUrYWa-URbgi-3pykg,6/1/2022,5 star rating,"This restaurant had been on my list for almost two years since I moved to New York. Going to Ugly Baby during the summer of 2021 required both a reservation a week in advance as well as the list of dishes that the table planned to order. Nothing that I say is of anything new-- Ugly Baby is one of the most unique Thai restaurants I have been to. All of their menu items are names that I had never seen before, which made it all the more exciting.Khoong Muk Kai Kem - shrimp and squid cooked with salted duck yolk. This was absolutely my favorite dish of the evening, and maybe one of the best things I have ever eaten. I ordered another bowl of rice just so I could soak up the remaining sauce. Kang Hoh - pork shoulder and glass noodles slathered with red curry paste and Hung Le curry. Rice is also mandatory to clean up the plate. Laab Ped Udon - Beware, this one is not for the faint of heart. I have a very high spice tolerance, and I could not stomach more than a few tiny bites of this dish. The duck salad is fantastically flavorful, but the spice was so overwhelming that we had to box most of this after several glasses of water."
2460,XpgquUrYWa-URbgi-3pykg,3/4/2023,3 star rating,"- Panang beef: Overly sweetened. I like the cooking but the seasoning was off- Fried fish: Well fired though it should have been served with some seafood sauce or some fish sauce- Nam tok beef & tripe: The seasoning was awesome, and I like the spiciness and the pla ra flavor, but the steak was dull. It should have been either cooked medium-rare or just really well-grilled like typical Thai style.The better dish of the night was Gang Som which was yummy but not enough to carry the whole dinner."
2461,XpgquUrYWa-URbgi-3pykg,10/22/2022,4 star rating,"Very amazing flavor with a lot of flames in the mouth. The spice was a bit too much for us to appreciate the dish. I would say overall experience is 3.5 stars. The place was packed and we made reservations a month in advance. The salted duck egg yolk squid and shrimp was my favorite. The curry had great flavors. The rice noodle dish was not our favorite. Overall, if you want authentic spicy food definitely give it a try. The pancake beer was amazing, highly recommend it."
2462,XpgquUrYWa-URbgi-3pykg,4/10/2023,4 star rating,"5/5 for food and 3/5 for dining experience:The food was amazing, complex, layered flavors. I'd recommend coming here with a big group of non-picky eaters who don't mind spice so that you can try lots of things. We had the beef shank coconut curry and the tiger prawn and omelette curry and both were excellent and unique. Dining experience was rushed and very loud--we were shouting over the music to talk to each other. There are no appetizers, no dessert, and the waiter told us we wouldn't have an opportunity to add anything else once we'd placed our order, all of which contributed to us being in and out in 45 minutes. Not a very relaxing dining experience but I'd come back with a group of adventurous eaters!"

Visited on a Sunday evening and was lucky to get a reservation. Upon arrival, was surprised to see atleast 3 parties waiting for tables in 15 degree weather so knew it had to be good.We were seated at the counter and got a glimpse into the kitchen in the back. Ugly Baby is a smaller restaurant but wow was it incredible. The dishes were very unique and provided a glimpse into the creativity of true Thai cooking. The ingredients and spices used in the cooking were unlike anything I've had before.Come prepared to wait if you don't have a reservation, but Ugly Baby is a must try if you enjoy and appreciate Thai dining, highly recommended."

I even called him to get his attention... but he just IGNORED us. Â Never ever had this experience in a restaurant in my life before..... forget about the food... service is a complete zero... after waiting 20min and couldn't even order food... we had to walk out...

Bar is long & beautiful, chandeliers are super cool & they already have a Halloween theme going. I find it all very charming. I just found out about the cozy patio area they have in the back! The space is larger than it seems which is a nice surprise.Getting to the food, it was my friends birthday yesterday & I suggested this place for his birthday dinner. It's safe to say everyone enjoyed what they ordered and we all had a taste of each other's plate. Fried chicken was absolutely amazing - I heard the crunching sound it made as my friend took a bite & I had to have some! Didn't disappoint, it was done beautifully. Salmon tartare tacos were adorable, loved the pork belly sausage sliders - both appetizers are small but satisfying because they're delicious but don't leave you feeling too stuffed for the entree. The drunken spare ribs are packed with flavor but I would never get that for myself because it's way too heavy. So of course ..I look at my bf with doe eyes & point at my mouth for a taste. Â I had the clam linguine & honestly it was slightly bland, nothing too exciting. Â We shared a mango cheesecake for dessert (super yummy & I generally don't even like cheesecake but bday boy does) -they were nice enough to put a candle in there and we all awkwardly sang ""Happy Birthday"" off key. It was great.All in all, this place is fast becoming my favorite in Bayside & I am looking forward to returning. Great service too, it was Saturday night & they were getting busy but I still felt they were kind & attentive. 5 stars from me!"

I argued with him telling him that it was their fault for not giving me enough in the first place and he raised his voice at me for a good 5 minutes and then finally poured me a TABLESPOON OF ALMOND MILK and then mumbled to his co worker that i didn't want to pay!!!!

But if you ask for more, they will give it to you without batting an eye. I hate how employees act like they are losing their personal money by giving you extra food. This location is pretty small; I was surprised by the minimal/lack of seating. One high table/high chairs, and one regular table/seating. There weren't any individual tables, like two or four seaters. Not a big deal, but I have never seen that in all the other Chipotles I've visited. We came around 6:40-7pm, and initially there wasn't a line, only three people in front of us. There were two people working, but they were working kind of slowly. Very quickly, more people came (dinner rush?), and a line began to form. Two other employees were on their break having dinner. Luckily, they sped up, calling for more help, and soon everyone was hauling! They guy taking orders was moving so fast, the girl putting the toppings couldn't keep up! Bathroom was pretty clean, there was liquid soap in the dispensers, and paper towels were plentiful. The faucet was weird though; the only way to turn it on was to slide it to the right, but by doing that, not only did the water turn on, it came out scalding! So you have to hurriedly wash your hands before getting burned. The place looked clean. Tables weer free of garbage, as were the floors. Overall, a good experience!"

There are no individual tables and lines are long given its store size. In the neighborhood, I much prefer the Montague St or even Metrotech stores over this one. The food is consistent with other Chipotle stores. I have experienced crappy customer service at this location. One time, they were out of forks and I politely told them they were out. I waited literally 5 minutes and told them again (it was lunchtime and my food was getting cold). The girl at the register screamed back hold on and wait. Finally someone refilled the forks which took all of 10 seconds. Â This is an example of crappy customer service."

When i finally got up to place my order, Â an employee was replenishing the chicken and spilled hot water all over the serving area.

But there are Bros in Gowanus. They would flock to a sports bar serving quintessential sports bar food and beer. I ordered the Ruben appetizer. From the menu I did not expect it to be a deep fried Ruben Roll. But hell, I love deep fried anything! Wrong. It was cooked in oil at too low a temperature, so what I got was a barely crisp roll sopped in grease. I'm going to have to eat salad for a week to make up for all that grease.

The bar was packed however there was just 1 bartender working, numerous people left rather than endure the lengthy wait for a drink, causing the bar to lose more revenue than it would have spent to staff a 2nd bartender. I will not return to watch NFL games here however may come back when it's less crowded and it's not 10+ minutes to wait for a drink."

A friend of mine took me there for a quick shot and beer last weekend and informed me that the place is one of the only spots in town that is still permitted to open at 6am. So, if you're looking to get your drinking day started early, I suppose this is the spot. Geeze, thinking of having my first drink at 6am is tough but, I'm not 21 anymore ;) Anyway, the bartender was friendly, they had free bagels and cream cheese (we were there around noon) and the place was pretty darn busy. They have a couple TVs so if you're interested in watching Sunday NFL, this is a cool option. Cheap drinks, good local vibe and free bagels on Sunday. What more could you want in a local dive?!"

Needless to say the cashier wanted to charge me $1 for the ice. She pointed to a sign which states that they charge 25 cents for each additional item that you ask for, napkins included! This is outrageous and just greedy! I will not be stopping by this bakery again. They're prices are ridiculous charging $2.25 for a small iced coffee. There are so many bakeries in this area similar to this one their iced coffee is $1.25. That's a dollar difference. Come on!

2521,dfuedxl8OncQJuF_SWNKig,6/2/2022,1 star rating,"I arrived at Burger Village at 222 Seventh Avenue in Park Slope at just after 8PM yesterday evening June 1, 2022 for a quick meal during the shift change at Methodist Hospital. I had been at Methodist with my mom since 2PM and I was starving. I was greeted by a male staff member, and chose to sit in the rear area of the restaurant next to the window. The only other customers in the restaurant at the time were two African American woman who were seated at the bar. He explained the menu and a few minutes later I placed my order. As I recall some time after I had received my order, a white male gentleman who appeared to be in his 60s wearing a beige rain hat, glasses, grey t-shirt and dark jeans entered, and was greeted by the same staff member. The staff member appeared to be familiar with the customer who appeared to be somewhat ""off"" and seated him a little further in rear of the restaurant on the opposite side of my table. We were the only customers sitting in that area. A few minutes later a couple arrived and sat close to the entrance. Several minutes later I heard the man making strange comments to the lone female staff member. A few minutes later I thought I heard the man mutter the N word, but I didn't hear it clearly. Several minutes later I clearly heard him say it out loud again. I became very upset and immediately requested that the staff speak to the customer, call the manager, and ask the customer to leave. I am an African-American male. I took video of him making a statement with the N word again, and asked him to confirm what he said. He repeated his statement. The male staff member who seated me earlier approached the racist customer and started to have a conversation with him. One of the African-American woman at the bar heard the customer's tirade and engaged him. She also recorded video and I heard her tell the male staff member she was going to send it to him. Also, the woman from the couple also tried to speak to the customer as the situation escalated. At that point the gentleman became agitated and stood up with his right hand behind his back as if we were reaching for a weapon. I asked him why he had his hands behind his back and if he had a weapon, and he did say more than once that he had a gun. I immediately thought of the recent racially motivated mass killing in Buffalo. I advised the staff several times to call the police, but when they didn't comply, I called 911 and gave them a description of the belligerent customer, and told them he mentioned having a weapon. I tried not to make any type of movements that would be seen as aggressive as not to incite him if he did have a weapon. The police arrived several minutes later. Two male officers initially responded, and I heard one officer state ""we just talked to you."" It appears they knew him as well. Two additional officers arrived and escorted him out of the restaurant and to a waiting ambulance. The female staff member I spoke with said the man comes into the restaurant often, and is 67 years old, has cancer and possibly dementia. She said he had never made racist remarks before. Does that really matter? He clearly made racist comments and threatening gestures last night. Why is this man still allowed in your restaurant? It appears that he has a history of bad behavior. I had no way of telling to what extent his behavior could be violent. This could have easily turned into a dangerous situation where someone was seriously injured or killed. I felt threatened and also feared for the safety of the other patrons and the staff. The safety of your patrons and your staff should be the first priority. There should be zero tolerance for this type of behavior. I suggest that first the owner and management review any security footage from approximately 8 PM - 9PM on June 1, 2022 to verify my statements. I also recorded video. You Â should speak to the precinct and find out what happened to the customer. I know I saw that he was brought to Methodist before I left there with my mom after 10 PM. I saw him seated in the Emergency Room. You should make sure that your staff knows the protocol for this type of a situation. If you know this man then you need to take further action to make sure this never happens again. Surprisingly, to add insult to injury I and the women seated at the bar were asked to settle our bills after the incident occurred. Our dinners were ruined. How could we enjoy our dinner when a racist, possibly violent man was seated in the restaurant? We were offered nothing by the staff for what had just transpired. I think that's incredibly horrible business and extremely insensitive on the part of Burger Village. Disgusting actually. I don't plan to support your business in the future."

I came here last night before they were closing and surprisingly they sat us down and did not rush us out. I had the impossible burger, a plant based burger with cheese and avocado and it was really good, pricey yes but it brought great quality so I did not mind. The concept at burger village is ORGANIC, FRESH, NON-GMO, cage free ingredients . I really love that. They offer french fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings. They even do a half/half basket which is a combo of both onion rings and fries. I am not Â a huge fan of onions at all but holy cow there onion rings were so GOOOD!!

Here is my experience:Yesterday I went to Burger Village, as a frequent customer; I only eat organic food, so my options are limited, and I have been here over 150 times. I want to also preface this by stating that not only have I worked in the food industry- I've worked at celebrity bars and restaurants, so I know what customer service is supposed to be like - and how customers should be spoken to. As my sister and I went to pick up our food that we placed online (maybe about 10 minutes before we got there). When we walked into the restaurant, my favorite waitress told us that the order was just recieved on their end - we were slightly confused, but said nothing. Another waitress by the name of Sedeth (excuse me if her name was spelled wrong) was eating at the bar, and even though we weren't speaking to her at all, she interjected and told us in a very rude and impolite way that it would take 15-20 minutes, and we *need* to go wait outside. My sister and I were really thrown off by the way we were spoken to, and we went outside. As I was replaying the situation in my mind, I became upset and decided that I wanted to ask why I was being dealt with in that manner. I proceeded to walk back into the restaurant and speak to the other waitress Ash. While I'm telling her that Sedeth was a bit rude, and maybe needs to be spoken to; Sedeth comes over and asks if I'm referring to her, I reply yes, and she began to argue with me, and ultimately tells me that I need to 'relax'. A caucasian woman walks in, and Sedeth speaks to her politely and says 'your order will be ready in 10 to 15 minutes, if you could please wait outside'. I state ""I wish I was spoken to in that manner"" and she tells me that it's not that serious. Even the customer that came in was upset on behalf of us and how she was behaving. When I asked for the manager; Sedeth told me the manager doesnt come into the shop, but Ash informed me that the supervisor is in attendance on weekends. I'm putting this review EVERYWHERE that it can go. Keep your racism to yourselves. #blacklivesmatter #blm #equality #equalityforall"

It began when I placed an order before leaving the office. I figured the timing would be perfect, as it took me 30 minutes to reach the restaurant. Well, once I arrived, I discovered they never even received my order. At the time, it didn't seem like a big deal. But that was before I waited 40 minutes to get my order... and watched as two tables got served before me, despite arriving well after me.It didn't end there though. When I arrived home, I found that my meal was completely wrong. My lettuce-wrapped chicken sandwich somehow became a plain chicken sandwich on a bun sans any of the toppings I had ordered at an extra cost. My side of 'crisp veggies' were wilted, warm, and slimy. Then there was the inexplicable hamburger that was included for some unknown reason (I did not order any burgers). They didn't even get my sauces right.The restaurant is refunding me for the meal. So, I will most likely give them another try soon. I truly want to believe they are better than this singular experience."

Â Not surprisingly, I actually didn't do anything on Cinco De Mayo and instead came here during the weekdays to grab some lunch to go.I went with the Veggie Burrito. Â For one, I was pretty impressed with it. Â First, the burrito itself was huge. Â Second, there were literally a ton of veggies in the burrito. Â Sometimes when people order ""veggie"" burritos, it's merely a burrito with rice, beans, lettuce, cheese... you know the standard items. Â This was different - literally a variety of veggies throughout the burrito. Â Even with the size of the burrito, it didn't fall apart pretty easily. Â Huge plus. The burrito was $9.50, which given the serving size is a damn good deal. Â There is a decent amount of seating inside (and outside if I'm right) so plenty of people sit in to eat too.

It was partial self serve so I am not sure if the man is always there to serve the food. We ordered the 25 taco combo for four people to share. The food was very abundant. I believe we ordered al pastor, steak, chicken tinga, chorizo and barbacoa. All the tacos were great except the chicken tinga. It tasted like tuna, thankfully one of us didn't mind the taste and finished it off. (I wish they served free salsa and chips at least to people that order larger combos, but wishful thinking. Ahaha.)It's a no frills store. You order and you get your food pretty quick. This is a great place to bring a hungry group that are craving some Mexican tacos."
