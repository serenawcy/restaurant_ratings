It's just little fried of nothing with sause on it. Still good price, and there are not any greater place than here..(so mean to say but truth)The closest Chinese restaurant. That got another star."

AND you get a free soda!!!She moved here just a year ago from the other end of Astoria-- more gentrified.  I like this area,  it feels more grounded, real, with genuine normal families, seniors all sizes shapes colors.  And this shopping center is truly GREAT! Very very well choreographed by the owners.  Perfect retail mix!!!I always ask the staff,"" what is your favorite dish"" and this time it really worked.  He recommended beef with scallions.  Wonderful!  I also love the very generous sized ( compared to others) FRESH delicious shrimp dishes. Seasoning could be stronger,  for me i love a wider use with a stronger "" hand"" of spices since i love to cook.   But for a convenient CLOSE take out with OUTSTANDING prices and good portions ( value), you really can't find better options!And great staff.Enjoy!"

Generals Tso's, fried rice and chicken wings kinda place. With that in mind buy what you like, ask for it exactly the way you want it and be satisfied with fast Chinese food. No frills.I like my food spicy so I bring a chili pepper and they cook with it. They make excellent food and now as spicy as I like. Friendly, help and courteous staff make getting what you want painless.I'm not saying this is white table cloth dining but I am saying to can enjoy good takeaway Chinese at a good price. Give them a second try."

Their chicken wings are always delicious and their shrimp and broccoli is too. The egg rolls are fresh and crispy.. mmmmm scrumptious. They also make a mean chow-fun.Go into this place and give them a try. They had a bad rep yearsssss ago before, but growing up in the neighborhood they really have come a long way. Good stuff!"

But because there was a low number of reviews in general I figured that could be why. Anyway, worth the try. The delivery came on time and everything was there how we asked for it. My bf started with Crab Rangoon. It was good, but it did lack crab. He also ordered some pork steamed dumplings. I had one and it was delicious. He also ordered (sensing a theme?) Sesame Chicken and it was also really good. Better than most. I had steamed vegetable dumplings and they were good. I ordered some wonton soup which I tried the next day and it was good but a little too salty. The wontons were perfect. All in all a good choice in Astoria. Mostly pretty darn good!"

Now I was like okay maybe they had a bad corn day but let me enjoy desert I take one bite of their not authentic tres leche and immediately got a sour taste in my mouth which made me spit it out and once I took a sniff I can tell the cake was bad and smelled like spoiled milk . I don't know if this is what they serving to take out guest but they definitely need to do better."

I came upon this place while visiting another place to eat and decided to come back and give them a try.Well that day have arrived and i was in the mood for some nachos and lots of tacos. I took my friend along for this experience because we both love anything pertaining to Mexican food.Although the covid restrictions and still in tack we decided to sit outside to eat instead because its was a beautiful day and the weather was nicer side that day.Nacho macho is quite small but seemed very cozy we got there and decided right way what we wanted to eat so we got the Loaded nachos with steak , chicken quesadillas, three tacos chicken, steak and fish and the mexican corn.While waiting for our food we got complimentary chips and salsa which was quite good the chips were very crunchy and fresh. Our food started arriving right away i couldn't wait to dive in the nachos were absolutely delicious and definitely loaded a must try will be coming back for more. I only had a chance to eat the fish taco which was delish and the corn was a sweet sensation in the mouth . Everything was so good i am definitely coming back for the loaded nachos."

They did such a great job putting together such a big order and the food was so delicious. I also really appreciated them being so nice! I would totally come back here and eat in-person! I also *highly* recommend them for big to-go's :)"

So yesterday's the first time back in roughly 2 years.Still haven't changed my order. I got the Grilled Chicken Torta, with chipotle sauce and no smashed beans, and split half with my sister. The torta is as tasty and as fulfilling as I remember and it reminded me of why I love this place so much. The chicken is well seasoned and packed with flavor and the entire torta, from the tomatoes down to the avocado, just tastes so fresh.I can only attest to the Grilled Chicken Torta (and well, the nachos), but it really is so darn delicious. Give this place a try, I assure you won't regret it. Will definitely be visiting this restaurant more frequently in the future!"
18,znlol6dCKwjoXpZZwV_ZOg,6/21/2021,5 star rating,"Small little place. The staff at the counter was really nice and efficient. We ordered tacos, nachos, rice and beans. Everything was was good. Chorizo tacos was not salty and too oily like other places. Carneasada taco was good and our. The beans were amazing. Nachos was typical chips and cheese. Would recommend if you're in town."

I would be back keep up the good work !"
22,9dqJrTzx0GvBNb-J0VyeGg,8/9/2022,3 star rating,"We went here for a quick and easy breakfast and it was, but there were some down sides. First the food wasn't fresh, it seemed like it had been in the cases since the early  morning . Second the doughnuts were overly grease and a little soggy but still tasted ok. On a more positive note, The butter bread was good it had a good balance of sweet and savory flavors. Paris Baguette was definitely a good get and go meal."
23,9dqJrTzx0GvBNb-J0VyeGg,11/13/2021,2 star rating,"This is by far one of the dirtiest of the franchise locations. Not only are tables ALWAYS dirty, the seats are so dirty you might feel you need to hover yourself and not sit down. It's about the worst experience eating at this location. Management seems least concerned about the level of dirtiness and uncleanliness."

25,9dqJrTzx0GvBNb-J0VyeGg,11/6/2019,4 star rating,"I miss the Union Square branch (the roominess of space!) but now they opened a branch right by 23rd street.  It's still fairly new, the service consistency is not there... yet. I've been here quite a few times during the breakfast hours. I love their pastry and cakes, it's lighter than the usual American cafes (lighter in sugar). Process at Paris Baguette: Upon entering, pick up your tray, lay down a parchment paper, pick up a pair of tongs and begin selecting your treats! I would often buy a good 5-7 items for my team.Some staff would individually wrap the pastry, which is great because someone on my team is allergic to nuts. This would prevent cross contamination.  However, literally the next day, another staff would just pick the pastry up with the wax/parchment paper and put them all together into a paper bag.  When that happened, I had to buy another pastry but asked it be separated. Then there's one time, when a staffer misheard what I ordered and overcharged me - but thankfully, her manager was able to correct and refund my card. I welcome having a lighter yet delicious option, as opposed to their friend next door (chick-FIL-a) with a food coma induced type breakfast.  Enjoy!! #eatwelltraveloften"

All their fruit cakes are delicious. They are also not that pricey. If I could give it 10 stars I would. Blueberry chiffon cake is so good and so is the chocolate ganache."
27,9dqJrTzx0GvBNb-J0VyeGg,10/23/2022,3 star rating,"I love this place I really do, but let's start off with the service. Extremely slow there's only one person behind the cashier making 10 different orders. A Coffee that should take me the most 5mins to pick up requires 25mins. I would love to give it 5 stars because of the amazing pastries & coffee but the service is horrible."

Plenty of space, tons of seating, easy queue setup, good lighting. Surprised that they don't have Apple Pay! Staff is friendly and service is quick!Had the breakfast croissant sandwich and thoroughly enjoyed it! The croissant was perfectly flaky and buttery, as I'd hoped. Will definitely be back! This would be a nice place to get some work done on my laptop or read a book."

30,dNFsMw-z3Vsa5TbJd9Q4Ew,12/27/2022,3 star rating,I've been wanting to try this place for a while but I was disappointed.  They only had holiday themed drinks on the menu.  I'm sure they can also make regular drinks but I didn't ask.  I got the big apple but it was super water downed and I couldn't taste anything except melted ice so I wasn't a huge fan.
31,dNFsMw-z3Vsa5TbJd9Q4Ew,4/29/2022,4 star rating,"I've now been here a handful of times. This seems to be the perfect go to spot after visiting the Moma/ watching films at the Moma that screen late in the evening. The vibe feels like an elevated dive bar with caricatures of famous people on the walls. They also have space in the back that can be reserved and used for private events.Everything here is just right. They stay open late. The cocktails are pretty good and strong: I had the margarita, whiskey sour and a vodka tonic. The short rib sliders are my go to and they never disappoint- full of flavor and juicy patties. The service is friendly and attentive. It can be a bit difficult to ha e conversations as the music is pretty loud but all in all it's a great vibe."

34,dNFsMw-z3Vsa5TbJd9Q4Ew,10/31/2021,2 star rating,"Underwhelmed with the entire experience (other than their fun Halloween decor).  Went for a business discussion and they sat us at a table in the back with uneven seat heights. This is definitely bar atmosphere and bar food - don't expect anything more than below average.We got the slider sampler, fried shrimp, and mozzarella balls to share. I had a caprese salad for dinner (which was doused in dressing). None of the food met my expectations."
35,dNFsMw-z3Vsa5TbJd9Q4Ew,8/10/2022,4 star rating,"I had the opportunity to come here for a tasting event with friends for lunch on a Sunday. A reservation had been made for us before but when we walked in there was only one other person at the restaurant! Given that it has a more American sports bar vibe I could understand why it might not be someones first choice but if you're in the midtown area and looking for some common fare vibes this is definitely an option. We were seated when we arrived and given menus to look over to choose our main dishes. The server brought us out several of their house cocktails which were all flavorful and strong (which we liked). We got an order of burger sliders, wings, and onion rings for our appetizers. For the main I went with the chicken club sandwich which was super tasty! It also came with a hefty side of fries but you can choose from a said salad or onion rings as well. Overall a good dining experience to go with friends or grab casual drinks at the bar!"
36,dNFsMw-z3Vsa5TbJd9Q4Ew,9/10/2022,3 star rating,Stopped in here late at night around 11 PM. Ordered a salad side of fries and pretzel bites. A large Bluemoon the slice of orange.

A great selection of draft and bottle beer on Happy Hour and great appetizers. We had the mini tacos and quesadillas. Excellent. Our waitress, Jayne, was extremely attentive and friendly. This is a place we'll return to as we visit Manhattan."
40,M2AfRLalBLSoj8WBxCtbZw,7/28/2019,4 star rating,Great place to grab coffee at a reasonable price. Cute Small outside and inside seating area. They serve cupcakes cookies and other pastries which looked really good but I would definitely stop by for iced coffee again. They do have an almond milk option.
41,M2AfRLalBLSoj8WBxCtbZw,1/9/2020,1 star rating,"I got here a little early on a weekday morning. They open at 6 and I got there at 5:55 and asked if they're open yet. The man opening on 01/09/20 said only coffee for now so I asked if he will have vanilla chai at 6. He assured me, ""yes 6 o clock"" so I went back into the car to give him some more time to set up. I came in again around 6:03 and he proceeded to give me attitude and say ""you think I'll have it ready this early ??????? It takes 30 minutes the machine isn't working"" even though he's the one who told me he will have it at 6. A vanilla chai is made by mixing a powder and milk together....what machine isn't working?????? Even if there was an misunderstanding he did not have to be rude about it and even GET IN MY FACE with attitude. What kind of customer service is that????? I left my house so early to give them business because I genuinely enjoyed their vanilla chai but given this mans attitude I'd rather go to the Starbucks across the street. Good job ruining someone's morning Connecticut Muffin!!!"

43,M2AfRLalBLSoj8WBxCtbZw,6/12/2016,1 star rating,"Worst muffins I've ever had in my entire life. Blueberry was the consistency of a dish sponge and tasteless while the corn muffin was also tasteless and dry as a bone.  Furthermore, I asked for nitro coffee and without advising me that they were out of nitro, server just gave me regular iced coffee.  Overall I'd rather go hungry than eat breakfast from here ever ever ever again. Nine thumbs down!I have to update because i went back yesterday while waiting for street cleaning to be over and purchased what was labeled a ""pumpkin muffin"" before i left i asked ""does this have nuts"" because it's weird for a pumpkin muffin to have nuts and also there was nothing to identify it had nuts and the woman behind the counter replied "" of course it has walnuts, pumpkin ALWAYS has nuts"". As if pumpkin muffins having nuts is a hard known fact taught in school since kindergarten. (Side note it's not) So I commented back ""oh i'm allergic it should really be stated"" where the woman reiterated that ""pumpkin always has nuts"". So i'm not sure if she comes from a different world where it's taught PUMPKIN MUFFINS ALWAYS HAVE NUTS but this place doesn't give proper allergy warning and thats a semi serious thing."

45,M2AfRLalBLSoj8WBxCtbZw,1/13/2020,1 star rating,Had the most God-awful cappuccino here. I had forgotten that coffee could be so bad. How does a place like this stay in business? Do better.
46,M2AfRLalBLSoj8WBxCtbZw,10/8/2019,1 star rating,Just had the worst service by a woman behind the counter. I assume she's the owner because she should fired.

47,M2AfRLalBLSoj8WBxCtbZw,1/12/2018,1 star rating,They have great pastries but their coffee is terrible... I've given him several chances and ordered cappuccinos with different kinds of milk and they all taste horrid. Definitely not coming back unless I want a muffin.

When I handed the guy a $20, he looked at me like I destroyed all his hopes and dreams and/or murdered his children and groaned, ""Don't you have anything smaller?"" 2. The music is more Top 40 Club than Relaxing Coffee Shop. Does anyone else hate that Black Eyed Peas song? Tonight very well may be a good night, as long as I don't hear this song again. Mazel Tov.3. It is HOT in here. I bought a cup of tea so I could sit down and get a little work done, but even with the door wide open in jacket weather, after 10 minutes I was sweating and had to leave.4. This one is my own fault, as I should have known better. Sitting in a coffee shop across from a school in Park Slope around 3 pm... No, no...that's my laptop, little guy. Please wipe your cream cheese on your mother, not me."

Perhaps it's because of the delicious food, or the nice staff, or home-y/cozy environment, but yes, I highly recommend for their food. Not a greasy food galore like other Chinese food places but a veggie plenty entree type of place.The Combo is perfect for 1 person.

The flaming duck experience fell a little flat.  The chef cutting the duck was  not interested at all.  Now if you are selling a gimmick experience and charging a sizable premium, I would have hope to have some type of an interaction with the guests.   Obviously we were filming this , but that should be expected.  Now for the food.The  duck itself was under seasoned and oily from the oil used to put it on fire.  The skin was crispy but had little to no flavor. I would say skip the flame and just get the regular duck.  You won't miss anything.Ordered the Waygu beef rolls and again, disappointed.  They tasted more like beef jerky with no seasoning, yet cost $45.  I don't mind the price but what was done to that high quality beef should not have been allowed.Had the Dan Dan noodles and these were very good.  A bit on the soup side, but the flavor was on point.Ordered the green beans with chopped meat.  As long as you eat the beans, they were fine , but the meat was way over salted.We didn't have any drinks, so really can't speak to that.The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Our waitress was very honest with us and provided excellent recommendations.Overall I would say this is a social media restaurant if you want to impress a date, take food pictures or bring someone from out of town.If you are looking for real authentic Asian cuisine, NY. Has plenty to offer, with awards and lower price points.  In my opinion this restaurant isn't winning any awards anytime soon."

Hands down one of the best peking ducks I have ever had. Don't get me wrong, you definitely pay a pretty penny for the dish but it's 100% worth it. Already figuring out who I want to bring here next.The duck itself is prepared two ways- first classic sliced and then the carcass is taken back to the kitchen and made into a stir fry with green beans. The stir fry was nothing to write home about, almost wish it was tossed into a fried rice instead but we ate it regardless. The slices of duck from the first cut are perfectly cooked, juicy and pure perfection. It comes with these crepe like pancakes as well as cucumber, papaya, scallion, hoisin and a honey mustard. We tried all of these toppings and everything was delicious. Other things we ordered were the spicy pork soup dumplings which were delicious and well made. Soup inside was great. We preferred these over the iberico dumplings. The chinese broccoli was delicious, very fresh and well prepared. We also ordered the pork belly special which was amazing as well.For dessert we got the bao which was decent but the soy milk ice cream was a bit odd. The childhood dessert was our favorite of the two. Will be back"

The Flaming Duck only has five RSVPs per night bookable two weeks in advance. Price for a whole flaming duck is $125 comparable to their regular Roasted Peking Duck for $112.-----Flaming Duck: served in two stages. First stage served with pancakes and second stage served in a lettuce leaf cup ($125).The duck is air-dried for 36 hours and roasted for 40 minutes before set on fire with Chinese rose wine and rum on a table right in front of you. It is then hand-carved to be served with steamed pancakes and an accompaniment of shredded spring onions, cucumber, and interestingly papaya.Finest roast duck that we have ever eaten. The live fire made the duck skin extra crispy. Slices were glistening with the perfect ratio of fat underneath the skin and meat that was the most tender that I ever had for duck. It was already perfect by itself, and wrapping in the pancakes just made it even tastier.Once finished, the second stage is served where a portion of the leftover meat is stir-fried with green beans to be eaten with fresh lettuce leaf cups. The stir-fry had good flavor and balanced nicely with the crisp lettuce.-----Calamari Flowers (小拌鮮魷魚花): tender squid in Sichuan peppercorn and chili oil ($21).A simple, cold dish that was good to start with while waiting for the duck. Squid was chewy and was not that spicy.-----Bao & Soy Milk (包子和豆浆): white sesame Chantilly, salted caramel, sesame cake, praline, soy milk ice cream ($17).What a fun and creative take on a dessert. The bao has a white chocolate shell filled with white sesame mousse as the ""dough"" and caramel as the ""filling"" for the bun. Soy milk ice cream was refreshing too.-----Childhood (童年): vanilla riz au lait, dark maple granola, butterscotch, finger lime, genmai ice cream ($16).Presentation was not as pretty, but we liked this dessert more due to its uniqueness: soft rice pudding topped with juicy beads of caviar limes, next to a scoop of Japanese brown rice green tea ice cream topped with crunchy pieces of granola, sitting on top of a puddle of caramel sauce. I especially liked the flavor of the tea in the ice cream.-----The restaurant is elegant and spacious with upstairs serving as a private dining space. Written dress code is elegant casual and uptown chic, but I saw customers in plain shirts and sneakers. Service was attentive and food came in a timely manner. Guest Wi-Fi is available."

The drinks sounded very interesting but both were very watered down.I was mostly impressed by any dish with chilli.If you come here for the special duck, you gotta reserve that at least 24 hours beforehand. Otherwise you can still get the half duck that is on the menu. The duck tasted great but so many other places can do the same for less. So in all seriousness save your money and go elsewhere."
67,qrncvjkiKN5Z-JC06ygy6A,9/5/2022,5 star rating,"Went here for a late dinner at around 9:45pm on a Saturday. Ordered the Comfortably Numb cocktail and I was extremely impressed. It started off ""comfortably"" with the lychee and honey notes, but the Sichuan peppercorn gradually kicked in and actually gave the ""numb"" feeling to your lips without the spiciness. The shrimp spring rolls were crispy and juicy. The soup dumpling was okay. The Peking duck was very impressive as well - even compared to many restaurants in China or Hong Kong it has very high quality. Nice skin to meat ratio and smells so rich of duck oil. The second part of the Peking duck was also very well flavored and well balanced with the lettuce. The Chef fried rice was also very flavorful and act as a great filling end of the dinner."

I would recommend coming with a group of friends so you can try as many dishes as possible.Although the dimsum dishes were slightly different from traditional, I think that's what makes Hutong different. You are paying for the experience, ambiance and quality. Definitely get the peking duck (was devoured before I can even get a picture), Yu Xiang Crispy Pork Dumplings, wagyu beef mille feuille and the soft shell crab (red lantern)"

The 2 slices I got (vodka sauce, marghertia-esque slice) were excellent! Crispy, thin, and extremely flavorful, this is the kind of pizza that you come to NYC for.

I have lived in NYC for a long time and I still don't have a pizza place I feel like I call my own. So, I ventured to Nolita on a late time after some recommendations. I was really excited to try this place especially because when we arrived there was a huge line. I ordered the spicy pepperoni and the white pie slice. The spicy pepperoni for me was the best slice I had this summer. There was genuinely some heat on the slice, which was great with how crunchy the pepperoni is. I would definitely come back for this slice. The white pie was good but nothing crazy. I think it needed a little boost of flavor and it had potential to be amazing. Overall, really great pizza spot, nice staff, and quick service."
78,vpkTNjq9dRh9rT3Nh0pe-A,1/1/2023,5 star rating,"This is a good solid slice of pizza. Had a slice and one of the things that makes this slice stand out is the fresh basil on top. It is standing room only and there's a reason why there's a line out the door. Cash or card. The wall of fame is a nice touch and also shows why it's so highly rated. If you are looking to try a true New York slice, you can't go wrong with Nolita. The best tip I can give? Get whatever pizza is freshest out of the oven."

The dough is too crispy with the consistency of hard toast.I've read good reviews from her and I've tried it a few times hoping for the day to get a slice to match up to my expectations, but I've been disappointed. The grandma slice is the only one that's decent, but it's still not that great.Living in nyc I know what hood pizza is so my review is a reflection of what i know in comparison. The plus side is that it's open late."

Figured I would try the best of both worlds.  Dined here when indoor dining started to open back up. Good amount of space between tables, very clean, and all staff were super friendly. They seemed to take COVID very seriously.All the food were very delicious especially the tostones, beef with broccoli, pork fried rice, and crackling fried chicken. Might've been the best tostones I've ever had (and I can't believe it coming from a Chinese restaurant). All the seafood dishes I had were also incredibly fresh which was surprising as well.

Portions are huge!! Everything was amazing. Flavors were on point. The owner told me they have been here for 30 years. These restaurants are slowly disappearing as the people who built them embrace retirement and old age. We need to help save these once-thriving Chino Latino fusion. Go here you won't regret it!!"

However, it is one of the few places left of Spanish-Chinese food. Fairly priced, tasty, and real meat. I ask anyone who goes to compare their chicken & broccoli to this one BIG BIG difference.

90,UBqLK5kg0kT72CIaBYa5Zg,9/7/2021,3 star rating,So I have been here in the past and liked the food. So we decided to try it again. I didn't have any drinks the last time and we saw a huge menu for a variety of drinks. We tried the house tequila and a house margarita on the rocks. I must say I was hugely disappointed. It didn't even taste like real lime juice in the margarita.  And the tequila was okay but nothing great. I've had better house infused tequila with pineapple or other fruit that tasted better. Now or appetizers. OMG you must try the guacamole. So fresh so delicious and just the right blend of lime and cilantro. Absolutely fabulous. Chips were crunchy and flour based which might be a turn of for some. But the appetizer was great. Main course we got fajitas. And in all reality it all barely fit on the outdoor table. Hot sizzling and good.  I have had more flavorful but they fit the bill and were satisfying. And didn't even have room for dessert.

I mean the entire menu without skipping a beat amazing. Kuddos to him. Aside from his rapping skills, his customer service was great (attentive and not annoying). As Henny lovers, my twin and I ordered the Henny O' Rita's for our drinks. Not only were they good but also decorative. I haven't had candy in so long. Why not have it with alcohol. Just saying. The drinks were a decent size and came with an extra shot of Henny. The food wasn't bad either. Let's just say after drinking I definitely scraped the plate. No shame in my game.

My neighbor at the bar was enjoying his huge Rubby Ducky fishbowl. This place is heavy on strong drinks and great presentation! The bartender was more than pleasant and super attentive.  The bar just had a great vibe! The space itself is...'intimate' but not cramped. There's a neon/greenery backdrop, perfect for social media pics. There were two clean, well kept, gender neutral bathrooms. My only disappointment was not having tried any food.

We ordered a quesadilla and plate of tacos, and the food never came. Apparently there was a mix up with delivering our food to the wrong table. We left having been served overpriced drinks and some mediocre guacamole and left without ever getting our food.The manager/owner apologized profusely and gave me her card to go back after our show, but needless to say I will never be going back to Patron.

This is neither printed on their menu, nor their website, and none of the staff makes any effort to communicate this to the customers.The only reason I found out was because my friend was asked by a short, female cashier with brown hair if he wanted a coffee or a water with his purchase. I was in front of my friend in line, and the short, brown-haired female cashier did NOT offer me the same deal.I have eaten at Broad Nosh Bagels no less than a dozen times over the last few months, and never once have any of the staff or cashiers mentioned the free small coffee or water bottle deal. Which leads me to begin to wonder why the cashier asks some customers if they want free water/coffee and not others.While my friend was able to enjoy his freshly made everything bagel with a bottle of free ice cold water, I was forced to pay nearly $4 for a bottle of Poland Spring in order to keep from choking on my crusty egg bagel.I just felt like others should know about this policy, and that Broad Nosh should be more consistent in communicating this to their patrons.1 star"

I was a little uncomfortable sitting inside. People sometimes had masks and sometimes didn't. It's a really busy place. They have seven people working non stop behind the counter.

Always check your order because they forget my salad dressing...for my salad...every time. I always check for it and remind them. And they've been out of it too which isn't great for the lunch hour when you specifically ordered a salad hours in advance on the app. I mentioned this in another Chipotle review but I'm sad to say that Chipotle as a whole just isn't quite what it used to be.

The woman at the register wasn't friendly or helpful which sometimes is part of the vibe - not for breakfast on a Friday morning. I got an iced latte (nondairy options yay) which is good and the zappie which had interesting components - as a vegetarian, I appreciated the mushrooms. Overall it was a bit too greasy and not very flavorful aside from tons of cheese. It is a big portion so you could share between 2 people or save half for later."

The tuna melt had all these interesting ""extras"" so my taste buds were peaked. I promptly got myself there.Cafe is small. Two tables that seat 2 each, and they have bar seating by the window that seats 3 I think.On to the sandwich:I am not fan of Cheddar on my Tuna Melts and the man behind the counter guided me towards using Fontina cheese. Good choice.Also, the sandwich had chops of boiled egg (noticed this the 2nd time I bought it), pickles, arugula. I ask for 1/3 of the normal cheese because i don't actually like my melts tooooo cheesy.Price wasn't bad. It's on regular size bread so not too large. I inhaled the sandwich in 1 seating so that's not a big meal. If you like Tuna Melts then give this a try.The workers weren't the most personable so that's where I would have docked 1/2 a star."

The place is small  but still have a back yard for people to hangout. The front store, however, is tiny. Few tables and an outdoor table, many people were cramming there. Food: they have many sandwich choices but I didn't try it. Instead, I went for their flat white. Although I have not really had flat white for a while, i still know what I like, and what I dislike. For me, their flat white is light, even though I didn't order skinny flat white. The only cuteness of their flat white is their latte art - solid.Price: averageService: they are somehow caring, very much depends on whether you are a frequent here.Overall: okay. Nice neighborhood coffee shop. 3.5 star"

Generally, I eat here for lunch.  The lunch special is a great deal and can be used as a light lunch and light dinner, so from that perspective give is a great deal at $10 cash."
161,PiOv4vMRLaJJoqt_Eyebvw,4/8/2022,5 star rating,I love this place. Each time I come I wish I could order the whole menu. It's consistently good and well priced compared to other thai restaurants.

Lemongrass chicken had huge dry chunks of chicken with hard eggplant. Udom basil had dry beef with very few veggies.

Sure I haven't been out and exploring many restaurants since the pandemic started but this is our second visit here and we are going to be coming back! My boyfriend and I both agree Udom Thai really kills it with integrating all the taste points into a single dish from sweet to salty, sour and spicy! So far we've tried the jumbo shrimp dumplings, green curry, Tom yum soup, pad Thai, pad see ew, and spicy basil noodles. Everything has been great!And if you dine in, please don't forget to ask for their house made dry hot sauce!

The menu is extensive with so many options that you can't go wrong, including many vegan options or dishes that can easily be made vegan. The Spicy Basil Noodle with vegetables and tofu was excellent - the tofu was the perfect consistency, and the Rama Queen was also very good. If you're looking for a quick, satisfying meal with both indoor and outdoor dining options, this is a great spot!"

Avocado was pre-ripe, lacked flavor, and browning.  Pad thai was disappointing.  Very oily (see photo of the remains).  Chicken not old but not quite fresh and tender.  Udom, this may have been our last time together."

BEWARE: DO NOT MAKE THIS PURCHASE--my blood pressure went through the roof!  It is literally one small crab cut in half laying on a bed of green beans and carrots--did not look like it should cost $17.  - received meal after everyone: The soggy soft-shell crab was placed in front of me AFTER everyone else had finished their food. Please, bring the food out at the same time. - expensive: $17 for the aforementioned quality of food IMPRESSION: Poor--for dish, dining experience and audacity to charge me $17 for the horribly unsatisfying meal. If you have to eat here, order the Pad Thai, looked way better than what this dish put me through. Good god, why did I tip?"
169,y9GhIt1MLh6344ODA65NQw,4/4/2021,3 star rating,"Halal Boyz is an OK choice for halal cart food in this area. The Mix Platter (chicken and lamb over rice) is tasty, but the fries can get soggy as they are overlaid on, instead of separated from, the rice. The fries get further moistened by any sauce drizzled on top of the rice.A challenge for Halal Boyz is that nearby (by car, anyway) establishments offer better flavor and value, and more consistent execution and service, albeit at slightly higher prices. I've received bits of bone in the food here. The rice is sometimes on the hard side. And while some customers receive sauce thimbles upon request, others don't."

Plus, the reviews didn't look that bad. WRONG.I placed the order on Grubhub for 3 Mix Platters for pick up. Stopped by 30 minutes after placing the order and none of the platters were made. I had to wait on line and order the food. Top it off, Grubhub pricing was $8.99 while in store pricing was $6.99. The two dollars extra per platter was not bad if the food was ready for pick up and I did not have to wait on line to order. But that didn't happen, ended up wasting another 15 min in store ordering, so the extra charge was unreasonable.When he was adding the salad, I asked for some chickpeas. He did not tell me it was extra. Instead he said that I won't be getting my fries that came with the order because I added a topping to my salad. I honestly was fine with paying a bit extra for the chickpeas separately but he refused and would not give me fries. I didn't want to make a scene, so I reluctantly left the shop.The 3 orders via Grubhub costed me $29.23 and what I got was three mix plates with meat, salad, and rice. NO FRIES. Very disappointed at the service. The food itself was mediocre. I should have stopped at the halal cart in front of Kohl's. The food was not good enough for having to deal with the server's attitude and bad service. Would not recommend to anyone."

I've tried their chicken and lamb over rice as well as phili cheese steak and both were really  both in quality and flavor. I cannot speak for the rest of their menu as I have not tried it. If you're looking for a cheap place to eat in Fresh Meadows with good food it is probably one of two options (at least from what I've tried in Horace Hoarding).

Not hot enough but I also had to wait to eat until about 15 minutes after ordering so that was probably my fault. Natasha helped me with ordering. She was absolutely lovely, quick, and efficient.

Even have a photo of me circa 2007 posing forced 'potbelly' protruding standing under the sign 'Potbelly'. The Illinois locations always held a quaint vibe complete with live music, usually a guitarist strumming away and singing some tunes and I quickly grew fond. So when I returned to NY in 2012, I was thrilled to find a bit of sandwich nostalgia here in the city of many options.  I've since come once to twice a month and my go to is the 'Big Veggie'. I have no idea how I discovered this sandwich since it's not listed anywhere on the menu, but somehow the staff always know what I'm referring to: fresh mushrooms in a blanket of three cheeses on a bed of white or multigrain bread topped with your choice of hot pepper carrot medley, oil and vinegar, lettuce, tomatoes, thinly sliced pickles, and Mayo. I'd say 9 times out of 10 the sandwich is made to my liking and it helps that it's one of the cheaper and actually filling lunch places in the area. *the shakes are also delicious (cookies n cream) but I always feel 12 pounds heavier so I tend to space those out."

Clearly, they don't care about their customers. Plus, it was late. There were a lot of other restaurants that I could've ordered from, but I still gave them a chance.

It's one of the few times the food coming out actually looks more appetizing than the pictures. The chicken was falling apart and delicious, although I'd get a few pieces of small bones here and there that were soft enough to chew anyways. The meat broth was deeply savory and went well with the taro-y plantain texture of the mofongo. Unsure if I was eating it correctly, but soo yum !If you don't like plantains, try their plaintains! They kind of have tart bite to them that makes them feel extra yummy and real. Not a thing like plantains you might get elsewhere. Our servers spoke really limited English, but were kind in a totally unemphatic way that's always interesting to observe. You have to ask for water, but you get two big glasses!"

White rice... White rice should be a substitute, not the default. I was so mad. I really wanted yellow rice. I looked at the white rice for 5 seconds before I said fugg it and dug in.

However when she gave me my total it was a little over from the amount I was reading off the menu. She called over the owner who apologized for the misprint on the menu I had and agreed to give me the price I had, which I thought was nice. She promised my food would be over in 15 mins.....over and hour later she calls me back yelling asking for my building and apt number because the delivery guy couldn't find my house. Poor guy came huffing and puffing saying he had been walking up and down the block because she had written down the wrong address for him and he showed me the receipt to prove it.

I wish the curry had been a little more mild but still good nonetheless. Price wise - you can't really beat it. We were actually very shocked when we saw how low the bill came out to. You definitely can get more bang for your buck here. Only thing is I wish they served alcoholic drinks (I believe the soho location has drinks - so we were expecting the same from here)

It was our go-to Thai restaurant and would order from them 2-3 times a month.  We started having some poor experiences but then it would get better again. Tonight we ordered for the last time. All of the appetizers have now been downsized from 4 to 3 pieces apparently ( curry puffs, spring rolls, moo ping) prices remain the same. The mooping was 80% fat. It has been getting fatty the past few times but this was unacceptable. I'm not sure what they are thinking changing the quantities in their appetizers when everyone expects a certain number of items.  All of these issues have now caused us to find a new Thai restaurant for our new go-to."

I had mock duck drunken noodle as a main, and my wife had the tofu spicy basil fried rice. She's trying to eat more veg food, but often doesn't like tofu - but she really liked this preparation; the tofu was firm and flavorful. Both dishes were delicious and the portions were ample. I saw also that they have lunch specials.My one complaint/suggestion (from a vegetarian perspective) would be that they have a bunch of really distinctive-looking meat dishes, and I wish a few of those came in vegetarian versions also. But overall we really liked it and we'll certainly be going back."

We decided to try a bunch of different things:Assorted Appetizer (2 curry puffs, 2 spring rolls, 2 chicken and shrimp dumplings, and 2 coconut crusted shrimp) - I loved the curry puffs. It was packed with flavor. The spring rolls and dumplings were super basic. Shrimp was good, but it's nothing you can't find at your local Costco freezer sectionPapaya salad (green papaya, tomato, peanut and long bean in spicy lime dressing) - the spicy lime dressing was perfect. However, the papaya was a bit soggy; kind of like it wasn't made fresh. Maybe they just make these in big batches in the morning for the entire dayNua Yang Esaan (Thai grilled steak) - this was a bit dry and it needed salt. However, I must say that the jaew sauce made up for everything. It's a sweet, spicy, and tangy dipping sauce that I probably would have taken shots of, if it wasn't so spicy. Even though I loved the sauce, this dish is definitely not worth its $25 price tagPad Thai with chicken - chicken was a bit tough and bland and the pieces were huge (not in a good way). The flavor overall wasn't great. I think it could have used a bit more salt or a bit more of a tangy factorThai iced tea - I get this is supposed to be sweet but this was sickeningly sweet. We took a few sips but couldn't stomach the rest. We also ordered a coconut water, which they forgot but we decided it wasn't worth it to make them come all the way back to deliver a drinkOverall, the food was very mediocre.

The food came fast but we weren't rushed out. Looking forward to trying their lunch specials. Well definitely go back!

The egg sandwich came literally 40 mins later. They were busy but it wasn't THAT crazy ...perhaps they had lots of online orders? Whatever the case was, make sure you are ok with waiting - maybe we just caught them on a bad day but it felt chaotic and super disorganized.

The atmosphere is pretty nice but can get loud.  We ordered the truffle toast with bacon on the side, a farmers plate, and an iced latte.  The truffle toast was delicious but wish there was more than just 1 piece (toast with egg).  The farmers plate was great, included home fried potatoes, side salad, toast, and I ordered over easy eggs with it.  The farmers plate definitely filled my cravingsI would definitely come in earlier or later in the day as it does seem like it gets packed.  Would definitely come back for the farmers plate again!"
215,Qu3xQh6cQ8BDwHIBaEtHuQ,3/9/2022,4 star rating,"So the place is a small brunch place. It is small cute and tidy.  You have to order at the  cashier then take a seat, idk if the time changes that factor.  The people were okay. The food was good. I have with my eggs being well done scrambled. You can tell they scramble them just enough, but not for me. The pancakes were fully and yummy. I wish I got traditional .  The bacon was okay as well. It didn't look commercial; they looked very home style. THE HIBISCUS TEA WAS MY FAVORITE OF ALL TIME. I WANTED TO TAKE AN EXTRA CUP HOME. overall, if i wanted just pancakes or that iced tea. Id come again, other than that , it was just nice to try it."
216,Qu3xQh6cQ8BDwHIBaEtHuQ,9/2/2022,5 star rating,Perfection takes a little bit of time.My fiancé and I have been coming to Belly Cake since it opened. It's our favorite breakfast spot. When you're here make sure to order the farmer's plate and the pancakes - a must. It's busy on weekends and there usually is a wait but that's how you know it's good. We never had issues waiting or with services. To squeeze a business on Bell Blvd must be tough but they're doing it right.
217,Qu3xQh6cQ8BDwHIBaEtHuQ,1/17/2023,4 star rating,"This is a tricky review to write - if I'm scoring purely based on food, this place is 5 stars. The blue belly belly cakes were phenomenal - so soft and fluffy, loaded with blueberries, and the chocolate dream smoothie was also pretty good (though the banana was a bit overpowering). My friend had the avocado toast with prosciutto and said it was delicious as well. The service, though, was rather abysmal - her avocado toast came out more than 5 minutes before my belly cakes - and all the food came out ten minutes before our drinks did. I don't drink coffee so though it was strange it wasn't too bad - but for my friend who needed her morning cup of joe- ideally before breakfast - it was a particularly long wait. Be warned if you come in winter - it was COLD inside and we had to wear jackets the whole time. And don't forget it's cash only. I'll probably be back - the food was that good - but the service got in the way of what should've been a five star dining experience."
218,Qu3xQh6cQ8BDwHIBaEtHuQ,9/18/2022,3 star rating,"The first time I came here, they informed me and my friend that they ran out of pancake batter so we couldn't order any pancakes from the menu. Since this is a pancake house and that was the reason we came, that was quite disappointing. I ended up getting the avocado toast which was not very filling. I had to return a second time to get my pancake fill - I got the Skinny Bella and it was great- a fluffy pancake topped with green yogurt and fresh fruits. That being said, I don't know if I would come back because service was quite slow both times. PS this place is cash only so make sure to bring your bills!"

223,5IR02V3Bbkcbs14yfKNDTQ,6/28/2016,3 star rating,"During my search for more authentic Mexican food, we found this place. The inside is really small, with just few tables. But, I also heard that they have recently done some renovation, and expanded the space a bit. And there it was, to the left side of the cashier counter, a new space with interesting wall murals which was still work in progress.The menu had ample amount of offerings, but we didn't really know what to order. That happens when you are not super familiar with authentic food items... I wish if they had more pictures on the menu, so that we know what they look like, and make it easier to order. While we looked over the menu, they brought us some chips and very small amount of salsa. They were ok, nothing special. We had some fruity milkshakes which were pretty good. Then ordered three tacos each, which were very reasonably priced and they were tasty. While the tacos and milkshakes were good, the service was not so much. We didn't even get a glass of water, but maybe we had to ask for it. I don't think they came to ask if everything was ok, not even once, but this is not that kind of restaurant here, it seemed. It is more of a quick bite or to-go order kind of place. But, that also makes you feel not very welcomed. I always appreciate warm service at a restaurant or any eatery place. I don't think I will go back, but it was a good to experience an authentic joint."

Tons more space.Update 1/2018: had the chicken fajitas this time. Chicken was great but the rice and beans were meh. Tacos are where it's at! I tried the beef and roast pork this time. So good."

226,5IR02V3Bbkcbs14yfKNDTQ,12/24/2018,1 star rating,"Where to start? Almost everything about this experience was terrible. The waitresses were really rude. They didn't acknowledge me or the beau when we first came in. We seated ourselves after standing around for a few minutes. When we got menus I asked if I could use this Restaurant.com certificate (the reason we knew about/came to this place). She told me they don't accept them. I asked why not? She referred me to some other dude who told me they haven't accepted them for a while. I was like ""but I just got it and printed it out like three days ago."" He gave me a ""shit-out-of-luck"" look. I wanted to leave after this, but the beau said just stay.Then it took FOREVER for her to finally come take our order. As I was waiting I noticed one of the line cooks blow his nose WITH HIS GLOVES ON, then proceed to handle and chop vegetables. I was so disgusted and wanted to get up and leave but I didn't want to be rude. (I should have just left). We ordered five tacos between the two of us. I saw nasty dude leave for break and breathed a sigh of relief. He was gone for maybe 15-20 minutes, and of course came back just in time to put our tacos together. (Thank goodness he put on a new pair of gloves). And yes, our tacos took that long. My carnitas taco was completely disappointing. The meat wasn't even shredded. I thought carnitas was pretty hard to fuck up because it's ALWAYS delicious no matter where I've gotten it. The barbacoa taco was really spicy and actually really good and tender. The beau said his chorizo and chicken tacos were good, but agreed the carnitas was NOT GOOD. The tacos were $2.75 each. Not horrible, but more expensive than I'm used to for authentic Mexican tacos. That could just be a NYC thing. Eventually the waitress cleared our plates but never brought us our check. We had to walk up to the front to pay even though we saw her bring the check to another table. TL;DR, bad service, unhygienic (even though they had an A in their window), food is okay (avoid the carnitas). Horchata was good. Try at your own risk."

Personally, I've grown fond of ordering 2 bistec tacos with extra guacamole, which unlike the burritos don't come loaded down with all the extra beans and rice. You can order online on Yelp, but most times we simply call ahead with our order. Together, the above order takes no more than 20 minutes for them to prep before we come to pick it up, which we pay for by credit card.The service here is not all that friendly. At least once they've mixed up our order. But, the food is tasty and cheap enough to keep us coming back!"

I would've loved to do some work here but my busy schedule unfortunately did not allow it.The spot is right off of Queens Boulevard, so you might have a tough time parking, but it's well worth it. This café isn't large, but there's some seating here. The inside decor is really comforting and warm and there is also some seating outside as well. I was absolutely starving so I asked the person behind the counter if they had any suggestions. After quickly going over the sandwich selection I decided to go with their salami sandwich. This sandwich usually has avocado but they were all out. I really appreciated them letting me know right off the bat and asking if I wanted to substitute any ingredients instead of the avocado. I went with some arugula as it's one of my favorite sandwich ingredients. The sandwich was awesome! The salami was great quality and the sandwich was warmed up which allowed the cheese to melt slightly. No pictures available because as I said I was starving and completely devoured the whole sandwich. It also came with a side salad which was very nice and a great surprise. Can't wait to try other menu items such as their smoothies, their baklava, and maybe even some breakfast. Great service as well! Huge fan and can't wait to go back!"

The first time, the man took my order and communicated it to his coworker who was making the beverages. She was dawdling and after 5 mins of waiting I asked the man about my coffee and he reminded her again. She kept walking back and forth between the coffee machine and reading my receipt as if it was a complicated order. The second time I ordered my basic hot coffee. The woman who took my order got distracted making a salad - there were 3 workers making food while I waited almost 10 mins for my coffee. When I asked about it the woman who took my order just glanced at me and continued making the salad. The man came to the register and served it. Bless him. Good coffee and I always try to support a  local business. Shame it's terribly run."

241,Aa934EMuqCdEV86faZG-0A,3/9/2017,3 star rating,I've never had any issues coming to this Starbucks. The staff is super friendly and always willing to give you a free drink or upsize your drink for free if they make a mistake. I love Starbucks particularly because you can customize your drinks to your liking with a variety of dairy products and alternative sweeteners. Now that you can place your order in advance this saves so much time standing in line and your order is always ready by the time you reach to pick it up. The one bad about this location is The construction in the area. It's so difficult to find this location because there's a significant amount of scaffolding around it. The Starbucks is also tucked in the corner of a corporate building so it doesn't really stand out and on the street like 34th and Park Avenue.
242,Aa934EMuqCdEV86faZG-0A,5/17/2016,4 star rating,"Some may think what makes a Starbucks different than the other million stores but there are really some reasons and I'm not even talking about some special interior design cuz this one is more or the less has same design with many others but has more space inside so you do not feel as if on line for free food or see. I should say, the registers work really fast. Waiting on line is more annoying than waiting for your order. It never took me more than a minute to order and than 3 minutes to pick my order and leave. Once the half&half was over and when i asked more, the guy brought the new ones right away. I usually get the multi-grain bagel, toasted with cream cheese and regular coffee so have not much to complain about but i have tried the marble cake last week, they were better before  without chocolate coating on top but it has nothing to do with this specific store. Long story short, one of my fav locations."

There was no line and there were two other customers waiting for their orders. My barista somehow managed to mess up both my drinks. I accepted to take the latte how it was to help speed up my process, but when I got my americano, there was clearly not enough espresso in the drink (watered down and almost see through). When I asked my barista how many shots was in my beverage, he answered that there should be 3.. I don't understand how he wouldn't know how many he put in, he just made the drink. He went ahead and made the drink again. Management needs to retrain their employees."

I get there and am told ""we ran out of tea. Would you like a refund?"".  I'm done frequenting this location. It used to be reliable but for the past few months it's been a disappointment more often than not. If you run out of something or cannot fulfill an order, there should be a way to indicate as such on the app so people like me who are rushing to catch a train aren't wasting their time waiting for refunds for orders that cannot be completed."

The drinks are roughly the same, the food the same blah blah blah. The point is, you go to a starbucks more than once if A) its the only one around and we live in NYC so yeah, not the case or B) It has a good staff that makes your drink the way you want it. For me, that would be Danny or JImmy! These guys are awesome. The staff in general is pretty cool but I've been going here for a very long time and these two are awesome. I only see them on the morning shift mon-fri around 10am, and while the line may be long (theres like a LOT of people so yeah its gonna be long) they make sure my drink is right every single time just how I want it!So if you're in a super hurry probably keep looking for a regular coffee place or less crowded starbucks (good look morning commuters) or wait a bit and get the drink done right here."

Whenever I ask questions they answer and there are no attitudes.  I've only had one bad drink (salted caramel frapp was watery) from here but my first frapp (green tea caramel) experience was from this store and I've been hooked ever since. The stores is always clean and there's a few seats for you to sit and enjoy your drinks/goodies.

271,Aa934EMuqCdEV86faZG-0A,3/9/2017,3 star rating,I've never had any issues coming to this Starbucks. The staff is super friendly and always willing to give you a free drink or upsize your drink for free if they make a mistake. I love Starbucks particularly because you can customize your drinks to your liking with a variety of dairy products and alternative sweeteners. Now that you can place your order in advance this saves so much time standing in line and your order is always ready by the time you reach to pick it up. The one bad about this location is The construction in the area. It's so difficult to find this location because there's a significant amount of scaffolding around it. The Starbucks is also tucked in the corner of a corporate building so it doesn't really stand out and on the street like 34th and Park Avenue.
272,Aa934EMuqCdEV86faZG-0A,5/17/2016,4 star rating,"Some may think what makes a Starbucks different than the other million stores but there are really some reasons and I'm not even talking about some special interior design cuz this one is more or the less has same design with many others but has more space inside so you do not feel as if on line for free food or see. I should say, the registers work really fast. Waiting on line is more annoying than waiting for your order. It never took me more than a minute to order and than 3 minutes to pick my order and leave. Once the half&half was over and when i asked more, the guy brought the new ones right away. I usually get the multi-grain bagel, toasted with cream cheese and regular coffee so have not much to complain about but i have tried the marble cake last week, they were better before  without chocolate coating on top but it has nothing to do with this specific store. Long story short, one of my fav locations."

There was no line and there were two other customers waiting for their orders. My barista somehow managed to mess up both my drinks. I accepted to take the latte how it was to help speed up my process, but when I got my americano, there was clearly not enough espresso in the drink (watered down and almost see through). When I asked my barista how many shots was in my beverage, he answered that there should be 3.. I don't understand how he wouldn't know how many he put in, he just made the drink. He went ahead and made the drink again. Management needs to retrain their employees."

It used to be reliable but for the past few months it's been a disappointment more often than not.

The drinks are roughly the same, the food the same blah blah blah. The point is, you go to a starbucks more than once if A) its the only one around and we live in NYC so yeah, not the case or B) It has a good staff that makes your drink the way you want it. For me, that would be Danny or JImmy! These guys are awesome. The staff in general is pretty cool but I've been going here for a very long time and these two are awesome. I only see them on the morning shift mon-fri around 10am, and while the line may be long (theres like a LOT of people so yeah its gonna be long) they make sure my drink is right every single time just how I want it!So if you're in a super hurry probably keep looking for a regular coffee place or less crowded starbucks (good look morning commuters) or wait a bit and get the drink done right here."

Not the best Mac and cheese/ lacking something but can't put my hand on it, always room for improvement BUT it's not bad especially because it's more an American dish more than ja dish. I would still order it alone with my food.  Good price, taste good, and love the Customer service.Delivery : The driver was quick and pleasant .. called when he was outside and respectable when greeted.Overall I recommend this Resturant when want good tasting REAL Ja dishes..FYI: I Really Really Really Really enjoy their Soup and Porridge ... Extremely Great......."

The ""small"" size had a good amount of meat plus sides (rice, veg, plantains) and I was very full at the end of my meal. Though delivery was a bit delayed (totally understandable considering these times), I called and their telephone service and the driver were honest and gracious. I'm not familiar with Jamaican food, but I thought this tasted great and hit all the spots. Will definitely order again!"

339,BPLhZ4FildfaCiKLNd0dsA,11/19/2019,4 star rating,"Came here the first week of Oct for pregame before seeing Don Diablo at the Brooklyn Mirage. The bar itself is extremely dark, however it is quite chic (blade runner sci-fi settings with old school computer matrix fonts used for drink menu) and DJ spins techno tracks all night.This dive bar has really cool vibe and definitely attracts many patrons from their mid-twenties to late thirties to have a great night out while dancing to awesome tracks. In terms of space, it is quite small so it gets packed in no time even before 11pm hits. Drinks were around $11 or $13 each (quite expensive IMO since it is in the Bushwich area) but it was decently strong. I didn't interact much with the bartenders since my friends took over order duties, but I recalled them mentioning they were helpful, despite they took a little longer to make the drinks as the bar gets crowded.Overall, really nice dive bar in-between pit stops in the area. A little bit out of the way if you ask (it is located by industrial city), but great place to pre-game before a show at the Mirage. I recommend you check it you if you have a chance!"

341,BPLhZ4FildfaCiKLNd0dsA,2/27/2019,5 star rating,"I lovingly call this #MySecretGarden There is zero signage other than some holiday type lights around the only window & a red light above the door with people standing out front either smoking or trying to get in (depending on the night and the DJ).Once you enter you realize that what you thought was supposed to be a dive bar is actually a wonderful Bushwick upscale hidden gem.As much success as I wish for the crew at Jupiter Disco I also love that unless you know about it, you don't know. The DJs are eclectic as are the people that you will find coming to listen and dance to them as they take over the ones and twos.The drink menu is via one of two TVs at either end of the bar and scroll in a dot matrix way that makes you want to jump on a game of PacMan or maybe even better Galaga! If your old lady eyes struggle to read the menu you can view it via your cell at  jupiterdisco.com/menus.h….The bar is long, the dance floor very cozy and there are two booths available (right as you enter on right) if you are lucky enough to snag one. The lighting allows for the right amount of dim but ""I can see you"" with the perfect sexy glow omitting from the orange pipe lights above. This is an intimate space, please treat it as such, this isn't TAO.Drinks are not dive bar cheap you might have been hoping firbut they are also beyond reasonable for the craft and care that goes into making them. One of my favorite cocktails is the Salt + Ash (tequila base) which seems to have remained on the menu thanks to Al or Max, not sure which but maybe Max as it's his creation. The cocktail menu rotates and I always try a new cocktail once it's added. Some I've loved, some not so much but ALL are good - just maybe not what I was craving at that moment.For those looking for a snack with your libation Jupiter also sells empanadas.All in all, you'd be a fool not to step in & shake your tail feathers at least once here BUT also shhhhh only share this special place with those you really like otherwise it's going to become another frat bro location and let's please keep Brooklyn weird!!!

Very easy to miss this place as it looks like it's an abandoned shop. There's nothing too special about the inside, just the bar and a couple of booths. The annoying thing is the menu as there is none only a very 80s type computer screen. Decent selection of beers and okay Happy Hour prices."
347,BPLhZ4FildfaCiKLNd0dsA,9/30/2018,4 star rating,"Not a large venue at all but I like the dark atmosphere (it's quite dark) and they had an interesting theme.  I don't drink so I can't speak for that but the friend I came with had no issue with the drinks; pricing is high but they do have a great display for their menu and they also have empanadas, but I didn't get to try them.  I was mostly there to hang out with him and do something on a Saturday, figuring he might want to talk to some ladies as I wasn't there to meet guys & there weren't as many guys around.  It got crowded later in the evening but music was decent and the dance floor was pretty good.  The bathroom isn't as easy to get to but if you're looking for a club atmosphere without the douchebag types, this seems like a good place for that."

Apparently in the dystopian disco that only exists on Jupiter they serve 12$ vodka sodas, the menus are 10 point scrolling font on an old crt monitor and the music is hit or miss. It's trying so hard to be sci fi themed and I love their neon glowy cathedral mirror thing behind the bar, but something doesn't work about the theme. Fun place sometimes. The bartender spilled a glass of water on me on accident and didn't say anything and charged me $12 for another drink. There's no sign but it's not hard to find."
349,m3PS0tIaa0ChcP8Y5S-DrQ,4/20/2023,4 star rating,"I don't know why the rating isn't 5 stars except I don't give five stars. Let's leave the stars aside for a bit. If you want a real review from a real food critic, do a search. I think the NY Times did something on them. And price. 3 slices + two pellegrino lemon things = $30 or so. Worth it? Dunno. Was to me. Maybe not for you. Or maybe. Okay, but before going there. Napkins. BYO Napkins and water. Your hands, your mouth, your face, your S.O. will appreciate it. Here's my review. Mama's Too is different, and better, than most pizza places. I guess if Le Bernardin or some Michelin rated restaurant made pizza there might be something better. I haven't found it. Most of their pies are similar to Sicilian in depth and angles (rectangular), but none are the standard combination of dough, tomato sauce, cheese, which I love, btw. Some are outright weird. Poached pear with hot honey? Yep - weird. And yet. It's my third fave of their pies. Let me back up. They, per the NY Times, do something to the crust. Brush it with olive oil or something. That makes it crunchy. And wonderful. That's the base or foundation. Start with wonderful, go up from there. So, my faves: 1. Angry Nona. Some kind of salami type thing on some kind of cheese with seasoned tomato sauce. A pleasant hotness. Imagine a bite: crunch (crust), sweet cheese, hot thinly sliced meat. And as you chew, they combine beautifully. 2. Mushroom (funghi?). Some unusual mushroom (to me if not mushroom knowledgeable folk) found in Italy with carmelized onions. Earthy, slightly sweet, terrific. 3. Poached pear with hot honey. Yes, I only ordered it because it was weird. And when I took my daughter there, who had always given it the fish eye and tried it - it's crazy. Yes, the poached pear is sweet. The hot honey - sweetness of honey cut through by something peppery, and an incredibly wonderful combination. Other stuff is fine. The sausage thing is good but not that unusual. Alla vodka, sure. So, about price. Three slices (Angry Nona, Funghi, Pepperoni) and two drinks were $30. At my local place it would be around $15 - $20 with toppings, though not the toppings - cremini! that's the name of the mushrooms, and definitely not canned - at Mama's Too! (Their exclamation point, not mine.) I love it. Maybe thing going to a bar and having  well vodka tonic versus a Gray Goose or Belvedere vodka tonic."

Yesterday our party waited in line (I'm not talking about the time in between ordering and receiving food, I mean the pre-ordering line) for 20 minutes, with only four or five people ahead of us in line. Maybe the kitchen was short staffed yesterday, but it seems like a slice-and-serve pizza restaurant should be faster.Bumping my average rating down to four stars for now--but I stand by that the pizza is great."
351,m3PS0tIaa0ChcP8Y5S-DrQ,2/12/2023,4 star rating,"Ordered a few slices at MAMA'S TOO on Thursday evening. Worth the wait for their Upside Down slice and loved the texture across the board, but the flavors can be extreme.Quality: MAMA'S TOO serves a slice that is a mix of Sicilian and Detroit-style. I ordered three during my visit, the Upside Down, the 18th Avenue, and the Cacio E Pepe. My biggest mistake was not sticking more with the red sauce, which made the Upside Down the best of the bunch. They absolutely nailed that slice, with excellent crunch, wonderful, thick tomato sauce, and tons of hidden cheese. The 18th Avenue was good, with sausage, roasted peppers, and ricotta, but lacked the same wow factor. The Cacio E Pepe is not for me, incredibly heavy and creamy. If you like artichoke slices, then this will be up your alley.Quantity: Large and heavy square slices.Value: $5-$7 for a Pizza Slice.Ambiance: MAMA'S TOO is a pizza joint located in the Upper West Side. They have a small space, which is entirely kitchen, and just enough space for maybe two people to stand as they order. No indoor dining at the moment. They have a large shelter outside in the street, which has speakers, but no heating lamps. The pizza is hefty enough for easy takeaway.Crowd: Always a line, and not very efficient. May need to fight for a table.Service: Did not move as quickly as you may expect.Parking: Some parking on the nearby side streets."

I think you can easily share one slice for 2 people."

The staff was very friendly and service was quick but the issue I have is with the food itself. I ordered the Angry Nonna stand the Poached Pear. At first bite the pizza was still a little cold despite waiting about 5 minutes. The flavor was great don't get me wrong but after 3 bites I found a strip of plastic baked into the pizza !!!! That's a huge no. I understand things happen but had that been a a kid they could've choked. I might have to try again to get another experience but first impressions are hard to forgive."

The slices are squares and delicious. It's a small hole in the wall with out door seating which is nice on days that the weather is behaving. My favorite pizzas are the funghi and 18th ave. I'm building up the courage to try the poached pear pizza. I heard it's amazing! Definitely stop by and try a slice you won't regret it.

My go-to is the Angry Nonna: it has sorpressata, hot honey and more. The speed of the service can be a bit slow, but I think that comes from being a popular spot. You have to wait in line outside and then there's an outdoor dining shed to eat in, so it's more of a grab and go spot/drunk eats rather than a nice sit down spot. I would also recommend timing your visit right; if you're in a rush you might not want to come here. I still give it five stars because the pizza is phenomenal!"

They have a window with cocktails to go, and a lot of people grab one and keep going. BUT THE SUSHI!I've been here a few times and have loved everything I've tried. The simple sushi rolls (salmon, salmon avocado, yellowtail scallion, spicy tuna) all have great flavor and aren't overloaded with rice, but have a great amount of fish.The uni is out of this world amazing. I've had the uni cucumber roll and the uni appetizer and it is heavenly. Fresh and sweet. They have a special roll called the umi kasai that comes out on a flaming plate. Delicious, highly recommend.Their sushi is also fantastic. Salmon, salmon belly, scallop, tobiko, ikura-- everything is so fresh and the cuts are high quality. Great sake selection as well as cocktails and beer, and the service is always super friendly. I'd be here every day if I could."

362,1_JEFOI19hAu3VoODcTUvw,12/21/2021,3 star rating,"Don't get me wrong. The food is not bad here. I got the ahi tower, a sashimi and sushi deluxe, and the umi kasai roll. The food tastes fine and the fish is fresh but I cannot justify the price of this restaurant. These three orders cost almost $100 for 2 people after tip and tax and the portions are pretty small. I could very well go to a buffet for this price and get my money worth. The tea they offer here is $3.50 and it basically just tasted like water. I did not taste any green tea flavor. If I knew their tea cost money I wouldn't have gotten it. The second I looked into the shop and saw that it was completely empty, I should've just turned around. It seems that the only people who eat here are people waiting for Joe's Shanghai and didn't want to wait any longer. The price point is so high for the area that it is located in. You can literally eat anywhere else. Sure if you have a lot of money lying around then you can go ahead and eat here and won't be disappointed"
363,1_JEFOI19hAu3VoODcTUvw,10/23/2021,1 star rating,"Like another reviewer mentioned, Seated brought me here and I thought I'd give it a shot since it was rated pretty highly on Yelp. I really try not to write awful reviews especially since restaurants are having difficulties during the pandemic, though I feel guilty not warning others about how bad the food was. The service was really great though, so we tipped well. It's not the server's fault that the food was horrible. I'm not sure what other people were ordering to give so many 5 star reviews.I should have followed the advice of other reviewers but I still ordered the karage fried chicken app. It was probably the lowest quality nameless branded frozen popcorn chicken you could buy from the freezer section of the discount grocery store. It wasn't cold or raw in the middle like other reviewers mentioned, instead the chicken was so over cooked it was inedible (so maybe feedback is being considered).The raw fish was not fresh and was served to us warm. The cooked salmon appetizer we ordered was burnt. There were flies all over the restaurant and we were one of two tables during peak dinner time on a Saturday night. Hoping that management can improve the food because the interior and ambiance is really nice. There's a lot of potential. TLDR: bad food, expensive prices, but good service"

I had the Umi Kasai which was the scorching roll which was also really good.Only underwhelming part was the size of the cocktails and the rolls were above market rate in my opinion.
366,1_JEFOI19hAu3VoODcTUvw,7/16/2021,2 star rating,"We had reservations via Seated at 7pm on a weekday - we were immediately seated and there were only 1 or 2 other tables at the time. We ordered a karaage chicken to share, and a Canal Bowl and Gyudon for me and my friend, respectively.Karaage chicken looked tasty at first sight, but unfortunately tasted like they were mass-produced and had been frozen - I felt like I could have gotten the same popcorn chicken at a local fast food restaurant. The one redeeming factor was the sauce - like a spicy mayonnaise - which I did enjoy.My Canal Bowl was quite disappointing - it was a chirashi dish with salmon, tuna, hamachi, shrimp, and tamago. The fish didn't seem to be fresh and left a bad aftertaste in my mouth. Tamago was rather tasty with a nice sweetness but didn't make up for the other subpar sashimi. Definitely not worth the high price.I had a bite of my friend's gyudon as well, and found it to be quite mediocre - beef had an OK flavor but was dry and overcooked, and the rice felt soggy with an overly heavy ""meaty"" flavor.I also found service to be quite lacking too - our waitress (in fact, the only waitress at the time) was often nowhere to be found, and even when she did show herself, it consistently took us at least a few minutes to get her attention, despite being one of only two tables dining at the time.Overall, the meal was rather unsatisfying to me and definitely much, much pricier than it was worth. Considering the alternative sushi options in this neighborhood for around the same price point, I don't think I will be returning here."

I feel as if this location met the usual standards, but I just can't get with the portion size and left there thinking I've should have eaten somewhere else."

The burritos and the bowls are my favorite, I'm the type to add every single topping from the bar - can't forget the guacamole! Staff is friendly and works fast. The location is quite spacious so there's a lot of seating. Although I frequent a lot I have to dock 2 stars as the last few times I've been the place looks dirty. The garbage cans are overflowing on the regular, and the counters are very messy. Finding trash on top of the tables has become typical as well. I believe its because they are short staffed as I haven't seen anyone going around cleaning and very few staff behind the counters/kitchen."

Maybe it's because I grew up there but I always enjoy the tingling sensation of being back in good ol' BK. And of course, one of my fav neighborhoods is Carroll Gardens.Last summer, I stumbled upon Postmark Cafe after having brunch with a friend. I'm so glad we ended up going there because their dirty chai oat lattes are DA BOMB DOT COM. Every time I order one, I gingerly hold the cup in my hand. And every cup has all the right notes - rich without being overly sweet; frothy, yet silky smooth at the same time. It's like having all the joys of Christmas in a cup. Who doesn't want that?!Postmark Cafe is a great place to get some work done or catch up with a friend. I did the latter & my only regret was not spending more time there since we both had plans later on in the day!"
410,6IdG1EY4qZ_X9GtqIAmQEg,2/1/2021,4 star rating,"Visited Postmark Cafe for coffee on Friday morning. A solid choice for an iced coffee, and I place I think will only get better once you can sit down inside again and enjoy your beverage as you read or do some work.Quality: Being new to the area, Postmark Cafe was recommended as a top coffee shop, and after a couple visits it is easy to understand why. The combination of friendly staff and delicious drinks is exactly what you hope for. While I was not crazy about the Latte I tried, the Iced Coffee, my standard, is fantastic. Rich, flavorful, and something I will continue to order even when it is below freezing. They also have some food items, but that will have to wait until we can return inside, sit down and truly enjoy the shop.Quantity: Standard size cups for both hot and cold drinks.Value: $4.00 for a large Iced Coffee. $5.00 for a large Latte.Ambiance: Postmark Cafe is located on the border of Park Slope and Gowanus in Brooklyn. As a result of COVID, they are operating out of a window, but from peering inside, it seems like a cozy space awaits the reopening of indoor dining. They did set up a quaint little outdoor area, which will be nice when the weather warms up, but for now it really is about grab and go.Crowd: Too cold for folks to hang out, but each visit I have a found a small line waiting for coffee.Service: Extremely friendly staff, who truly care about their customers and the neighborhood. Love how they support the Gowanus Community Fridge.Parking: Street parking can be found throughout the area."

I respect that a lot.The place is cool. I didnt realize until later that it has another room to the left of the front counter. I am not a coffee drinker but the green tea was solid. I come to these shops to get some work done and this checked all the boxes. Wifi worked great as well. I would come back.

Coffee and pastries are fresh and very tasty. You won't find much more beyond that except for some water or juice (There's no kitchen) but it's great.If you can't find a seat when you come in, there is an area below for about 12 people, where they have some board games and books in case you want to have some fun with your children.Speaking of children, although I didn't see any during my visit, I did notice that the bathroom has a little station for changing diapers. This speaks volumes of the focus they have on serving their customers and ensuring a pleasant experience.Since I just had breakfast I could only order a MOCHA ($4.75)... Twice though. It was SO GOOD! My buddy ordered the Flat White ($3.25) and he said it was good. We paid $1 USD for bottles of water, which tells me ""This is the minimum we could charge!"".Top this with an AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE with BIG SMILES and it made it really hard for us to leave the place, but we had to.Great experience overall, definitely will come back!"

417,6IdG1EY4qZ_X9GtqIAmQEg,8/28/2018,5 star rating,"A good example of a quality neighborhood coffee shop is Postmark Cafe, situated in the heart of Park Slope. Like many others it is a tiny place, but packed full of great options in both drinks and ambiance. It is a crowded spot most of the time, so unless one is going in for take out, the actual time spent in the joint will really vary.Coffee wise, their offerings are pretty standard for a cafe. From espressos to lattes, they've got a lot of the basic drinks covered. They've got a number non-coffee options as well such as smoothies, hot chocolate, and teas. There is also some limited food like croissants, bagels, baked goods, as well as sandwiches such as grilled cheeses and egg and cheese.They have done a good job in maximizing the space for all sorts of situations. While I'd never recommend for a group outing to this spot, they do have a communal table that can fit up to 6 at a time. Coffee dates and casual meetings aside, I'd reserve this spot for a solo journey and perhaps some quiet time for work. The WiFi is decently fast, but nothing mind blowing here.Decor wise, it is a mix of homey and hipster'y (#1) but comfortable enough to enjoy a casual caffeinated drink. There are a decent number of outlets throughout the place (along the wall, on the legs of the tables) and even outdoor seating to boot. The ventilation is a bit of a challenge with a lack of AC, but they do have ceiling fans and standing fans to get the air flowing.I give the service a thumbs up and the prices are standard for the area. One thing that I appreciate that they do is they donate tips to different non-profit organizations every month. A little nobility and compassion, even from a small coffee shop in Brooklyn can go a long way.__________(#1) At this point, it's the borough's default option."

426,AahdCoFHilyFDqoljCpvgw,11/2/2013,1 star rating,Absolutely horrendous service today. Went to get a simple order. Fries and a small sized praline and cream mc flurry. I've gotten the small size at practically every Mcdonald in the city and like most people would assume this one would offer that.  I arrived at around 8:10.  The female cashier was rude from the get go like she was in a hurry.  I have her my order and she stated we don't have small or snack size mcflurry here.  I asked why. She just said. I don't know that's the way it is. I said is it that u just don't carry that size cup or u don't carry that item. She said I don't know.  Do u want the regular size or not In a very nasty tone.  I said I want to know why all the other mcdonalds carry this and u don't.  Still nasty and didn't have an answer. All the while another female cashier next to her is co-signing with smart remarks as well.  The girl then says look I'm trying  to keep this rolling.  She then motioned for a manager and I said good cause that's who I want to talk to. She then said oh he's busy and I said I'll wait. He then came about and explained how they don't order a certain type because that franchise doesn't requests for them that often which is dumb to me but at least it's an answer.  I explained that this McDonald's is closest to me and it's silly that to get a certain size for a mcflurry I have to walk a mile. Overall hated that experience and didn't get anything because I was pretty put off after dealing with that cashier.

There was a customer complaining when I walked in I requested for my order #52, and when my Frappe came the cup bag was covered with syrup and then she didn't place the cup on the counter , the cup had fallen on the side before i could get to the counter. I requested for another and then the questioning and unprofessional responses began. I requested that I will contact the owner Cecil Joseph and then the worker Ms. Cornelius began stating profanity and why does everyone have to call Cecil's name ? I asked her about her conduct she just continued with her rudeness in front of my five year old and stated you can't get me fired i will still have a job. I stated I feel sorry you think i would have to get you terminated when your unprofessional behavior will be the factor. my daughter began to cry and I left the store. The kids they hire should be more sensitive to the customers and be professional at all times. As long as this Ms. Cornelius is working there, I will not visit McDonalds , she has ruined the experience for my daughter.BY the way, the manager did nothing to stop her employee from being so rude.Update :  CLOSED TODAY BY THE DEPT.

When I usually order my regular dishes (large sesame chicken, small beef broccoli and small shrimp lo mein) from the old lady, she gives me a 2 liter soda and a quart size white rice. When the young lady takes my order she gives me small rice and 2 cans soda. Today I ordered large sesame chicken and small beef w broccoli and the menu and receipt says $20.14 but she charges me $20.40. No big deal but it's the principle and the fact that the young one always try to be sneaky. I called them and asked why they overcharged me and they said I got an old menu. Ok, maybe so, but why does my receipt say $20.14???  I AM SO DONE WITH THIS PLACE!!!"

Broccoli was not fresh, brown rice was mushy but the standout for the epic culinary failure was the boneless ribs.There was no sauce (which is actually a glaze). Boneless ribs are typically made with love, put under the broiler,glazed and then broiled again, only to be finished with yet another coating of the glaze. These had no glaze and were fatty disgusting pieces of chopped up dry tasteless pork.Oh by the way, they're cash only !!!Why cash only ???"

I was late to the game and only tried it for the first time less than a month ago and have been back 3 more times at various locations, oops. I ordered online and picked up my salad from this location and it was ready upon arrival. This location didn't have a line though so the online ordering probably wasn't necessary. As far as the salad goes, it is my new favorite. I always order the make your own and I typically get the spicy broccoli (which isn't really spicy but still delicious), chicken, tomatoes, and onions w/ the cilantro jalepeno dressing. That dressing is outstanding and a must try. And of course I always add the bread too which is fresh and delish. I am knocking a star for the price. These salads easily run you $12-15 dollars for 4-5 toppings which is steep to make a habit out of. However, if I am staying in on the weekend then sweetgreen is my go to."

Not mixed, the ingredients are separated out , including three dressing. Not what I was looking forward to. Also the tossed I had did not know how to make it and she had me walk through which ingredients are in it since she couldn't see it/reference it from her end."
451,jjBcUeE4-Z8VoGFaYkdxvw,7/5/2021,3 star rating,4 minutes agoNEWI love going to sweet green locations for the salad. It is a shame though that this particular location does not have working bathroom even know it was built with one. The fact that it is constantly out of order makes me wonder about the level of hygiene altogether at this location.
452,jjBcUeE4-Z8VoGFaYkdxvw,3/5/2020,4 star rating,"I'm gonna start off by saying this place is PRICEY. I mean $16 for a salad is a hefty price. I usually get the chicken caesar salad which is around $12, but this time I wanted to try the buffalo chicken bowl, as I saw a sign for it outside the store and I thought I'd try something new. It was certainly tasty and had a lot more flavor than I had expected, but I don't know if I can justify the price, so I think it was my first and last time trying it. For the price difference, it's really not that much better than the chicken caesar. Overall though, I do really enjoy going to sweetgreen; the ingredients always taste super fresh, they have a ton of healthy options and I love the free bread that they include with their salads! It's definitely convenient and quick, but there are surely other places in the area where you can grab a bite for cheaper."

456,jjBcUeE4-Z8VoGFaYkdxvw,12/31/2017,4 star rating,"Another sweetgreen location! Won't complain about that. This location is conveniently located very near to Union Square. Pretty small store in comparison to their other stores with not much seating- more for take out. sweetgreen is pretty standardized with good quality across the board. This location had good and fast service, no crazy lines at the time I went (and whenever I pass by), fresh veggies, and they were also playing some good music!You can create your own salad, or choose from their curated menu items. They have a list of local items, if you would like to eat more consciously. Very easy for vegans and vegetarians to eat here. sweetgreen has the BEST dressings ever. Try the spicy cashew. So good. All salads come with a complimentary slice of bread.Price- a salad will run you $9-$12 typically, depending on how much toppings. Tip- download the app for rewards and some $ credit on your birthday. You can also just pay with the app.Whenever I want something quick, tasty and healthy, sweetgreen is my go-to salad place."
457,jjBcUeE4-Z8VoGFaYkdxvw,10/26/2017,4 star rating,This is such a simple concept that is executed really well. Menu items vary from Mediterranean to Thai to Southwestern. They make the salads FAST. They are large and healthy. A little pricey but it's NYC. Highly recommend. Tip: You can order and pay online and just go in and pick up your salad from a shelf. #genius

Ugh, there really wasn't a second choice for the appetizers at the moment, so it was time to regroup on this fact. The table ended up getting the FAVA BEAN HUMMUS - Crudités, Grilled Pita, Za'atar and in the end I think we were almost glad the first choice was not available. It was a fresh take on something familiar and very tasty indeed!For the main course I had ALFIE'S GRASS FED BEEF BURGER - Fried Shallots, Gruyère, Portobello Mushrooms, Brioche Bun. I had the sweet potato fries with, and I was very happy with the choice. It was one of the better burgers to be had for sure, and I probably could have gone medium rare on it, which is something I would never think about asking for normally.Someone else at the table had the CHAR-GRILLED STEAK FRITES - 12 oz. NY Strip Steak, Hand-cut Fries, Green Beans, Chimichurri which looked amazing, and they were very happy with that as well.Then there is the fact that this place seems to have a full name of ""Alfie's Kitchen & Craft Beer Bar"" at least according to Resy. In addition to beer they have a very extensive drink menu, but my focus will also be on the beer. For me there were several new ones to be had here and what is nice is everything is on a board that is easily visible."

The food looks great, but I traveled across midtown because the meal that is currently their business display picture looked great, but was unfortunately not on their menu. The drinks were a little underwhelming. 1 didn't seem to have a good ratio of sweet/acidic and the other was tasty, but you could barely feel anything by the end of it. Also, the seats at the tables did not have backs to them.I may have just gone on a bad night, but that first impression did not go well at all."

The atmosphere is definitely very sports bar-like: very loud music, lots of conversations. The only bad thing was the music was super loud and we couldn't hear each other's conversation. We asked the waiter if it was possible to have the volume turned down but the waiter said, ""No unfortunately because it gets really loud in here later, we keep the music at this volume."" But we were able to move tables away from the speakers so that was a big help. The food was pretty good. I honestly don't remember what we all got and I didn't take any pictures even though I thought I did. But it is a nice area to just chill, relax, and have a drink with your friends.PS: Nevermind.

464,tOn-wEQ06ScrgeU5Ljw7Gw,6/16/2022,3 star rating,Usually I ask the bartender or waiter/waitress for recommendations because they know the menu! Unfortunately the bartender did not know anything... for me that is a big disappointment.Now the good part is they have frozen aperol spritz! How cool! Anyone who loves an aperol knows it's refreshing and a perfect spring/summer drink. It wasn't better than your average aperol spritz since it did taste different frozen but highly recommend if you like yours sweeter!We only got the spinach artichoke dip because the menu was very small and there weren't many options. It was off the side street of being near time square which was nice to not have all tourist area around it seemed like.

The crowd is decidedly local; woe be upon the casual tourist that wanders in here and enjoys a lovely experience, knowing they can't return any time they want. Brunch is a no-brainer here. The full irish offers plenty to munch on. A bloody mary or two helps with digestion, or so I tell myself. You can even lean all the way in and go bottomless; who's gonna judge you?More often, though, I come by in the evening for happy hour. $8 for an Old Fashioned brings a tear to my eye. $7 drafts and glasses of wine and $8 mixed drinks cover all the ground, ensuring a well-priced beverage for everyone. The dinner menu also has a lot of interesting options. I like the prosciutto flatbread and the buffalo chicken salad. Fancier fare, such as swordfish and steak frites, can easily be arranged. When in doubt, fish and chips won't disappoint. Alfie's is a sister restaurant to Jasper's, another well-loved 9th Avenue eatery. These are cheery, good-vibe establishments with a variety of local craft beer on tap and specials that resonate strongly. Tip your servers and bartenders and make your dreams come true."

We ordered via slice (their preferred online pickup option), and we got a grilled cheese sandwich, a melanzana panini, and a slice of strawberry shortcake. The grilled cheese was good, and my husband enjoyed his panini, but the shortcake left a lot to be desired. It was dry and the strawberries were dipped in something that made them taste medicinal. The other issue I had was that they never updated the app to tell me whether or not my food was ready or when it would be ready. I ended up calling the restaurant when I was walking there way (20 minutes before it said the order would be ready), and they said they were already working on it. When I got there, the food had been ready. Had I waited until the time listed, my food would definitely have been completely cold.

The omelet was requisite but the pancake w granola and bananas was stellar. I've never had granola on pancake and it jus adds a bit of chew and crunch. The pancakes were pillowy soft, best I've had at a diner. Lastly, whatever you do... don't go for breakfast n not order the corn beef hash. So oily, so gooey, so delicious.

He wasn't in the mood for coffee so paid for his breakfast sandwich (which according to the digital menu he saw inside while on the line behind the counter states a coffee is INCLUDED) & proceeded to walk out of the establishment. By the time he got the door he changed his mind @ decided he wants a coffee. He goes to the cashier @ asks for the coffee and the cashier who is also the manager says no its not free. My friend refers to the sign & also stated he got the same order last week & it was free. The manager/cashier said ""nothing is free In this world"" & begins to ridicule my friend and belittle him. He becomes this wise-ass and gave sarcastic/smart-ass comments. This is what I'm sure happened. People go in and see the digital menu as they're about to order & decide to get a breakfast sandwich w/ the included coffee. They pay & they get charged the 90 cents +tax and never notice it & leave. The fact that my friend ALREADY PAID and THEN asked for the coffee angered the guy off that his was going to actually be included, & gets smart with him. This is how you scam people.

The staff here (so many I wonder how they pay all these folks?) is wonderful! They're always ready to lend a hand and a few seconds after you walk through the door there's a smile and ""how may I help you?""The diner is sectioned off by oven baked pizza pie/pastry dept, coffee station, bakery, of course the regular dining area and a bar. There are tills at all of these sections but I'm pretty sure it's one boss/es. I prefer the outdoor area as I love people watching. So many stories pass by on the sidewalk as I take notes. I've had cuploads of cheap well tasting coffee here. I didn't enjoy the spinach pie I tried. The crust was to die for but it was absolutely filled with too much soggy spinach. I won't hold that against them because that's on me and what I like. Some folks live for that overwhelming amount of spinach. From the diners expressions the food seems to be good. Silver Spoon Diner judging from interactions between staff and customers is a community well loved staple. Even their notice board has information on deaths, births etc in the community.

479,oUVX94JtKyLPXozC2hemCg,2/24/2019,4 star rating,"The boyfriend was craving fish and chips so he chose to try this spot out for his birthday treat. Pitkins is definitely more than a treat because their food is definitely one of those spots the doctors tell you to stay away from but you go anyway because it's just so damn good. They give decent portions worth the price you pay for. The boyfriend ordered the Catfish Combo which came with a catfish fillet, crab sticks, scallops, and fries. I ordered the Wings and Seafood Combo which came with 3 wings, 3 shrimps, 3 scallops, 2 crab sticks, and fries. Everything was tasty especially the catfish that had that nice fresh fish taste to it. We devoured every bite and needed to take a nice walk in the park right after. If you're ever have a craving for fish and chips this spot is definitely worth a try. The only con about this place is the area is so busy so it's tricky to find parking. Street parking is available but you just have to remember to feed those meters."
480,oUVX94JtKyLPXozC2hemCg,1/25/2019,5 star rating,"This place is great! Whenever I have a salmon craving, I always think of Pitkins because it's so delicious and inexpensive (for the amount of salmon that comes with the order). I usually order the salmon (2 fillets) with rice and veggies with lemon pepper seasoning. The salmon is grilled and is crispy on the outside, but soft and juicy on the inside :). It comes to about $15.  I have tried their chicken wings as well with their honey hot sauce, that's pretty solid too.  The only minor thing I will add is that the rice isn't really anything spectacular, but goes well with the seasoned proteins!"
481,oUVX94JtKyLPXozC2hemCg,5/25/2019,5 star rating,"Delicious, tender and flavorful salmon and shrimp.  The wings were crispy and dripping in sauce. So good."
482,oUVX94JtKyLPXozC2hemCg,11/1/2019,2 star rating,The food was pretty ok. Unfortunately my co workers asked to use the restroom and the lady up front said no without even thinking about it!  No restroom for customer then proceeded to said it was broken. When I asked where do you use the bathroom.  She said she pays plumber all the time which come on it's unbelievable! I've been here before and it's never been an issue! Why close it to us now when you just took our money? I find that to be very poor customer service after paying for food.  Very upset and this will be the last time I step in this location:  I don't want to mention that may be it was my go workers color skin but what right is right and what's wrong is wrong.

My son had chicken tenders and vegetable rice. Pretty good, orders are big. Could've shared it. So I got to take some for lunch the next day."
484,oUVX94JtKyLPXozC2hemCg,2/23/2018,5 star rating,"If only I could express how much I love this place in words. First let me just say how super picky I am with food and service. I've been here 3 times and the food is always great! I've tried the chicken teriyaki which was good (I prefer Sarku in the mall though) lol The crab salad was delicious! But my go to is the Double Salmon combo which comes with 2 pieces of Salmon, shrimp, steamed broccoli & carrots as well as vegetable fried rice. It's a HUGE portion for just $16.00 - whereas other restaurants where you would pay more for less. They give you different sauce options but I always get the butter & herb. What I love is that it's perfectly cooked, not too much seasoning and NO FISHY SMELL OR TASTE!!!  A-Mazing! Lol  parking in that area is terrible so I would suggest taking someone to sit in the car while you wait or if you're in the area,They offer delivery through uber eats! I'm in Rego Park but I will drive there because it's honestly better than a lot of places. 2 people can even eat from it depending on your appetite but my meal I can split into 2 meals! Trust me and just go! #Yummy"
485,oUVX94JtKyLPXozC2hemCg,10/1/2018,4 star rating,It is so hard to find good food around this area. This really hit the spot. They serve you a lot of rice but also enough chicken and shrimp. We ordered chicken and shrimp teriyaki and seafood combination. The scallops in the seafood combination were very small but hey scallops are crazy expensive right now. The clams and shrimp in the seafood combination were delicious. The food has just the right amount of spices.The cashier was really nice. Even when a person was holding up the line talking to his girlfriend trying to decide what he wanted. If it had been me I would have said something but she was patient and nice.The place was clean. I will definatly come back.
486,oUVX94JtKyLPXozC2hemCg,1/16/2018,5 star rating,"This is my go to place to get seafood. I've tried the fried whiting, grilled salmon, and grilled shrimp.

489,JntcefUWQm93rT58DuESNw,1/11/2017,4 star rating,"I'm a big fan of Checkers. The service was good and quick. Checkers has the best fast food fries I've ever had, honestly. Wingstop fries use to be my fave, but sorry checkers beat them to it. Yes, the fries are the bomb.com, perfectly cooked, so crispy and the cajun seasoning is always on point. I ordered a regular cheeseburger, it was good but I thought the onion they put in my burger was too strong and overpowering. I'd do without the onions next time. Excellent job with the cajun fries Checker's!"
490,JntcefUWQm93rT58DuESNw,7/31/2019,1 star rating,first off let me say this Checkers is a joke my husband purchase a Texas toast sandwich along with the chicken bites box we get home my chicken bites aren't in the Box only the fries I call the store only for a guy to pick up the phone and say who is this when I ask to speak to the manager I told him what happened he asked when I could come in mind you I live in Times Square I didn't feel like going back uptown especially it was raining but I did give them a bad review how hard is it to put chicken bites and Fries together in a box like really... 8.69 wtf
491,DGOLOC0kR5FCzvD7X6RNqw,5/25/2018,2 star rating,"The food is edible but far from being good. My friend and I both ordered Goat Biriyani and I received 3 small pieces of Goat and an additional 4 bones with no meat attached. My friend however received NO chunks of goat and only tiny pieces that looked like a one inch square torn up to pieces. Delivery was on time but we paid $32 between the delivery fee, food and tip and it was not worth it."

493,DGOLOC0kR5FCzvD7X6RNqw,5/23/2018,2 star rating,"I ordered by phone for pickup last night. They forgot our rice and the entrees were ridiculously oily. Seriously, the curry chicken was basically a soup of oil and some bones with gristle on them. There wasn't really anything edible  in the curry chicken. Also a few of the things I tried to order, they said they didn't have.The kabab was tasty, but it was essentially a hamburger patty. I ordered chicken, but it was definitely something like ground beef. It was just a patty, not an actual kabab. And yes, they spell it ""kabab.""It's cheap, but it didn't seem like our dishes contained much edible food. At least the staff was really nice."
494,DGOLOC0kR5FCzvD7X6RNqw,11/17/2017,5 star rating,"Loved the biriyani and the chilli chicken. Its inexpensive, tasty and the staff is courteous. I recommend this place if you love spicy food and miss or want to taste the traditional Bengali flavors."

498,DGOLOC0kR5FCzvD7X6RNqw,12/14/2017,4 star rating,"This place is one of my favorite Bengali restaurant in my neighborhood. Their chicken biriyani is so on point as well as the chicken curry. lunch deals are awesome but if you happen to order the over rice options, make sure to tell them you want rice on the side. Or no rice and get a biriyani. otherwise its too dry. Overall the experience has been great, and i would recommend everyone to try it"
499,DGOLOC0kR5FCzvD7X6RNqw,12/2/2017,5 star rating,It's right front of my business so very convenient for me. Food tasted really good. Owner & workers are very friendly.I would definitely recommend it.
500,DGOLOC0kR5FCzvD7X6RNqw,12/4/2017,5 star rating,"This place has really good Indian food. I've revisited recently and plan on making this my local Indian take out spot. The place is sort of in between a take out and a casual sit in restaurant so no fancy dates, but if you stop by and try the food you won't be disappointed. I've had the plain rice, chicken fried rice, spicy fried rice, chicken tandoori, spicy chicken kabab, tandoori chicken kabab, lentil soup, roti (it's whole wheat), chicken tikka masala, curry chicken, vegetable samosa, vegetable pakora, chicken shami kabab and I loved everything. I didn't think I would like the whole wheat roti, but it's good and it's even better with the masala sauce. I rarely find places where I try so many different dishes and love all of it. It feels like home-cooked meals."
501,WdaLydR9O57rWbTnQQQ1OQ,5/3/2022,5 star rating,"Best spot in the Bronx to get a quick beer, or three! They always have a bunch of new ones every time I stop in. And the owner Paul, is the greatest!"
502,WdaLydR9O57rWbTnQQQ1OQ,3/4/2022,5 star rating,The beer and service are second to none. They really know their beer and never steer you wrong. Great merch as well. Definitely a MUST visit! Much love to the staff!
503,WdaLydR9O57rWbTnQQQ1OQ,2/5/2021,5 star rating,A true enhancement to this Iconic Bronx market. The choice of beers and drinks are excellent!. The owners are passionate and friendly and drum up a conversation to make you feel welcome. Nice surroundings of the market with choices for lunch and dinner in a setting that makes the Historical Bronx landmark one to remember.
504,WdaLydR9O57rWbTnQQQ1OQ,5/24/2017,1 star rating,"I'm a lover of strong beers, and this place doesn't seem to step it up. Their only IPA had 4.9% alcohol, and tasted really flat. The only other options were too light of fruity to my taste, and were the closest thing to water I've ever tasted. You'd expect these options to come cheap, right? Nope. Not in commercial and touristic Arthur Avenue, folks. Almost $10 per beer... and you even have to wait for it! I'm done with this place. Actually, I'm done with the whole street!"
505,WdaLydR9O57rWbTnQQQ1OQ,7/20/2020,5 star rating,"This place is truly one of a kind. They work so well with the surrounding interior businesses that they incorporate it into their menu. For example, you want a sub from mikes? The server will go get it for you and just add it to the bill. I would recommend their burgers. Yum. The stars really come in for the once a month night club scene. It's never overly crowded and the music is indeed nostalgia heaven. Dancing next to a crate of tomatoes not so much but it adds a level of funk to the scene that can't be duplicated anywhere else. Hands down bets beer hall to go to in the area. Clinton Hall comes in at a distant 2nd."
506,WdaLydR9O57rWbTnQQQ1OQ,7/1/2015,4 star rating,"Walk in past the cigar maker, the deli and meat counters, and head right to the big bar smack dab in the middle of this place.Take a seat at a bar stool and drink some cold local NY brews served up in mason jars. ABC Beer Co, Ommegang, Bronx Brewery, Gun Hill and others. Try a flight served up in mini mason jars and have a taste of four different brews. They even have growlers if you want to take some home and get buzzed on your couch.If you need some eats they serve up a small menu of bar snacks, sandwiches from Mike's Deli, and pizzas from Cafe Al Mercato which are located in the market. Fresh, tasty, and at a good price.In the Retail Market it's a cool spot to drink giant mason jars full of beer during happy hour in Da Bronx. Listening to 80's hip hop and dance music. It's like a time warp in here. Cool and casual with a nice staff to boot. Get sloppy drunk and hit up a few local pastry joints when you have the munchies.Leave the gun. Take the cannoli."
507,WdaLydR9O57rWbTnQQQ1OQ,5/29/2019,1 star rating,"Beer was okay, food was good too, but what wasn't amazing was the fact no one told us the price of the beer until we got the check. Went in a group and had 10 beers which came out to $130 for just the beer. The waitress told us it's $13 a glass because it's a limited beer, and the bottle is $27, but as a first time customer, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT! I don't know how they run their business and was disgusted that NO ONE told us the price. Overpriced for what they gave us. Go to a local brewery where you can get GREAT beer for half the price, With better service. =]"
508,WdaLydR9O57rWbTnQQQ1OQ,12/22/2018,5 star rating,"right in the Arthur Avenue Market, it is a miniature version of Philly's Reading Terminal.  Entirely local.  Friendly service, very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the local craft beers offered.  Incredibly flexible about food- you can bring in food from outside or they will arrange your order from nearby Mike's market which has great sandwiches, antipasto, cured meats, and other Italian delicacies.  Has seating at the bar and benches.  I've also watched afternoon baseball games and World Cup matches there.   They have plenty of TV's and are very nice about putting on a channel for you."

510,WdaLydR9O57rWbTnQQQ1OQ,1/3/2017,3 star rating,"I have one main issue with the Bronx Beer Hall. The website lists their beers for the month, that's good and great but when you actually go here, you are quickly told those are the beers offered during the month but they are not always available. What? Then update your website to reflect that! I came in wanting to try the egg cream stout and was told it was sold out and they wouldn't be re-stocking it. Then they offered to let me try a regular cream stout, which I ended up disliking.The bar area itself is cute and cozy and right smack in the middle of the market. Plenty of tourists and locals surround you as you watch TV and drink your beer. I ended up going with a Gun Hill beer since I love them and I enjoyed it. I thought I was done drinking after a few of these but the bartender told me they had ""over poured"" one of these and it was sitting in the fridge waiting to be sold. I took it because why not? Oh and they also ran out of this particular beer 1 hour into me being there.For food they offer tons of bar bites, pizza, and paninis. The pizza we had was good. The fried pickles went well with the beer. They said the pickles would take longer but they ended up coming out way before the pizza. This was a good place to kill some time on a day off from work, however, I would not go out of my way to come here. There are way better drinking options in the Bronx that 1) list their beers correctly and 2) don't magically run out not even halfway into the day.Oh and avoid the bathrooms at all cost. These are obviously shared with the rest of the market and are disgusting. One of the sinks was missing faucets and the entire floor in the ladies room was flooded. Come here for the market, skip the beer hall."
511,zEHzdRjEa23tcH585_SqHw,11/13/2021,2 star rating,"Worst service of any Starbucks I've been too, and under resourced. I popped in because I had 9 minutes until my bus came. I was one of 2 people in line. It took several minutes for them to start taking orders. A man was in front of me, and we were the only ones in line. They only had 1 cash register (2 or 3 is standard in Starbucks locations). The man took 4 minutes to order, and then his credit card was declined 3 times. My bus was due any minute and a barista was still helping him. I asked another barista if I could just have water. She said I'd have to order it at the front. In most CA and WA Starbucks, they sometimes let you skip ordering if that's all you're getting. I pointed out the man in front of me was having payment issues, she sad too bad and I'd still have to order. Fearing I'd miss the bus I left. I would never choose this Starbucks again. They need a second cash register and nicer baristas."

It's too bad that this location sucks cuz it's within tourist spots.  That explains why it's always packed in spite of the service.Place is always dirty, tables not cleaned, coffee spills on the tables and floor.  Place is kinda dark for me compared to other branches I've been too.Staff are unprofessional, constantly on their phone or talking to each other or to a friend visiting them. They hardly pay attention to customers. I don't know why they even get your name when they won't even call it once they made your drink. You're sitting there like all this time while your drink is sitting waiting there for you to be picked up. Ugh!! Unbelievable!!!They could use some cleaning up and staff re orientation."

Lots and lots of seating including seating that overlooks the park. Individual tables and a larger communal table if you're looking to spread out or make a friend.

After 4pm, it was very busy and it took about 5 minutes to place my order for a mocha frap and about 10 minutes to receive it afterwards.As I waited for the order, I noticed a large queue of people waiting to use the restroom (thanks in part, I'm sure, to their recently adopted open-door policy). The place itself was in need of a little upkeep but I can't fault the staff for focusing on getting the orders out over picking up after customers.There is a good amount of seating, including at a very large table up front.My order was made to satisfaction so kudos on that. I didn't order any food so can't feedback on that. If you're in a rush, this may not be the spot for you. Then again, I've been to the Dunkin' Donuts around the corner and it's not really any faster. I conclude this is more the result of the location and amount of foot traffic so I won't dock them too much for that."
516,zEHzdRjEa23tcH585_SqHw,5/5/2019,2 star rating,This location can get very crazy. So many people come in just to use the bathroom. Thats not such a horrible thing but if your trying to enjoy your coffee and seated near the back it can smell pretty bad if they dont clean it constantly. I ordered a coffee and stuck around for a few to enjoy it but there were so many people sitting waiting for people I couldn't even find a seat. Its really only good for a grab and go coffee or food.

Having to wake up early in the morning is not always fun, but it's true when they say energy is contagious and I definitely wanted and eventually got that barista's energy to start off my day.

I am pretty sure that this is not the service, ambience or product quality that Mr. Starbuck had in mind.  He was thinking a warm-vibed place with quality coffee, efficient and smiling baristas, a nice place to start your morning or re-charge during the day.  This.  Aint.  That.

Before I take a big enough sip to realize it may not be soy milk, the cashier called me and said they were already remaking one because they might not use soy milk for the old one.

I explain that I was just asking about my croissant which I placed with my ice latte and I almost finished my latte and still didn't see my croissant. Then they found my order and ask if I want it to be warmed, I said yes, and then I was told I need to be back in the line and wait like another 10 minutes. Then I just ask them to hand me the croissant cold and I got out of this Starbucks. This is not my usual go to place and this will be my last time going to this Starbucks! Ps: Just notice the croissant was produce almost one month ago. Today is 7/18 and my croissant was produce in 6/24. Never see the wrapper when you ask for warm croissant."

I had 5 customers waiting for their coffees when I just finished my order, and waited another 15 minutes to get my cup after they have been making wrong coffees at least twice for other customers. I have to admit that after trying the new generation of coffee shops like blue spoon (next door) or caffe 1668 (in TriBeCa) where good quality of coffee beans and higher coffee making standard for the similar price offered at Starbucks, I would only choose S if there is no that kind of coffee shops around..."

The cream itself is supposedly made ""in house,"" according to the ads both inside and outside of the store. It tastes NOTHING like the standard sweet creams at other locations. Simply put, there is no element of vanilla nor sweet cream to it. Just straight up cream. Bland, and it's false advertising. The barista who works here is unprofessional, miserable, incompetent, and needs to take a customer service 101 class. Management reading this - take note. It's whoever was working the shift today, 10/16 around 1:15pm. She was the only barista there. She first made my drink with so much cream, the whole cup was white. Undrinkable. I nicely asked for her to remake it - and was met with so much contempt and disgust from her, that for a fleeting moment I contemplated taking the request back and just getting another one at the starbucks down the street. It's like I had insulted her personally. She did not respond to me verbally but instead dramatically dumped out the drink, hastily remade another and slammed the drink down on the counter. I thanked her and received simple silence accompanied by a glare. The replacement drink was equally disgusting. I have been a Starbucks gold member for YEARS. I visit a Starbucks location 365 times a year, at a minimum. This visit was unprecedented. Truly a 1 star disappointment."

In addition to being fast and friendly, she pays attention to each customer's order and is ready with a suggestion whenever folks need it. Thank you, Fatima!"
530,pTv4RDll3N_CGG3BwtEctg,8/29/2014,3 star rating,I came to this location for the first time on a Friday. The line was pretty long but it's to be expected with the morning rush. I ordered a tall iced white chocolate mocha with whipped cream (my favs) waited about 10-15 minutes for a drink that took all but two minutes to make if that. The whipped cream was slightly melted not a big deal. Would definitely go back when it's a little less crowded.
531,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,11/13/2021,2 star rating,"Worst service of any Starbucks I've been too, and under resourced. I popped in because I had 9 minutes until my bus came. I was one of 2 people in line. It took several minutes for them to start taking orders. A man was in front of me, and we were the only ones in line. They only had 1 cash register (2 or 3 is standard in Starbucks locations). The man took 4 minutes to order, and then his credit card was declined 3 times. My bus was due any minute and a barista was still helping him. I asked another barista if I could just have water. She said I'd have to order it at the front. In most CA and WA Starbucks, they sometimes let you skip ordering if that's all you're getting. I pointed out the man in front of me was having payment issues, she sad too bad and I'd still have to order. Fearing I'd miss the bus I left. I would never choose this Starbucks again. They need a second cash register and nicer baristas."
532,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,3/5/2019,2 star rating,"Okay this is it. Been here couple of times and told myself to give them a chance but I think it's time. It's too bad that this location sucks cuz it's within tourist spots.  That explains why it's always packed in spite of the service.Place is always dirty, tables not cleaned, coffee spills on the tables and floor.  Place is kinda dark for me compared to other branches I've been too.Staff are unprofessional, constantly on their phone or talking to each other or to a friend visiting them. They hardly pay attention to customers. I don't know why they even get your name when they won't even call it once they made your drink. You're sitting there like all this time while your drink is sitting waiting there for you to be picked up. Ugh!! Unbelievable!!!They could use some cleaning up and staff re orientation."
533,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,8/15/2020,5 star rating,A much needed renovation to the Starbucks located inside the historic Potter Building recently opened for pick up orders only so the store is partitioned off to only allow a few people in at a time. Expect friendly staff who always welcome guests with a smile. The renovated store is a lot brighter and warmer compared to the previous dark interior.
534,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,2/20/2018,4 star rating,"Spacious Bux in TriBeCa located very close to City Hall Park, Pace and Weill Cornell/NY Presbyterian Hospital. Lots and lots of seating including seating that overlooks the park. Individual tables and a larger communal table if you're looking to spread out or make a friend. Has a restroom with a code, which is nice, if you're in the park. All the usual Bux offerings. Service and music are usually good. I've had some grumpy experiences but the morning crew right now is pretty great. Keeps me coming back."
535,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,8/29/2018,3 star rating,"Located close to City Hall Park and the entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge, this is a nice-sized Starbucks. After 4pm, it was very busy and it took about 5 minutes to place my order for a mocha frap and about 10 minutes to receive it afterwards.As I waited for the order, I noticed a large queue of people waiting to use the restroom (thanks in part, I'm sure, to their recently adopted open-door policy). The place itself was in need of a little upkeep but I can't fault the staff for focusing on getting the orders out over picking up after customers.There is a good amount of seating, including at a very large table up front.My order was made to satisfaction so kudos on that. I didn't order any food so can't feedback on that. If you're in a rush, this may not be the spot for you. Then again, I've been to the Dunkin' Donuts around the corner and it's not really any faster. I conclude this is more the result of the location and amount of foot traffic so I won't dock them too much for that."
536,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,5/5/2019,2 star rating,This location can get very crazy. So many people come in just to use the bathroom. Thats not such a horrible thing but if your trying to enjoy your coffee and seated near the back it can smell pretty bad if they dont clean it constantly. I ordered a coffee and stuck around for a few to enjoy it but there were so many people sitting waiting for people I couldn't even find a seat. Its really only good for a grab and go coffee or food.
537,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,7/16/2019,5 star rating,"Came here for my morning coffee and I was greeted by some of the most kind and helpful baristas ever. The barista that took my order was so full of energy! Having to wake up early in the morning is not always fun, but it's true when they say energy is contagious and I definitely wanted and eventually got that barista's energy to start off my day. So if you want a morning pick me up aside from your coffee...definitely come to this location."
538,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,5/26/2018,2 star rating,"This Starbucks is a lukewarm mess.  They were incapable of being an actual hot mess.  After finishing the food portion of this cluster (which may have even taken longer to eat than normal because the food was cold on the inside) my coffee was still not ready.  I looked over at the group of people waiting for their coffees and even without hearing the specifics you could tell that things were going south.  Either I was witnessing a Resting Bitch Face convention or the dude in charge of caffeine was screwing up.  Five minutes later I knew the answer... as he stared through my very soul and asked if I had ordered something.  No...  I'm just standing here admiring how you can fill order after order without seemingly getting one of them correct.  There is a skill set there that I don't think the world outside this one Starbucks should be deprived of.Man, you guys... you lost my order, you screwed up other orders, my food was cold, your condiment station looks like the last person through was Jackson Pollack, no sleeves for the cups... but it didn't matter cuz the coffee was not that hot). I am pretty sure that this is not the service, ambience or product quality that Mr. Starbuck had in mind.  He was thinking a warm-vibed place with quality coffee, efficient and smiling baristas, a nice place to start your morning or re-charge during the day.  This.  Aint.  That. But I only went here once... so it might get better (or worse) other days."
539,OuNYQaqEJjkBHRdnC-4HOw,3/19/2019,5 star rating,"Usually I don't write reviews for chain coffee shops like Starbucks or other big coffee companies. But they provided such great services, from the cashier to the barista, they deserve to have a 5-star review.  WELL DONE!!I ordered a soy milk cappuccino, I got mine and took a small sip. Before I take a big enough sip to realize it may not be soy milk, the cashier called me and said they were already remaking one because they might not use soy milk for the old one. They team was were very kind they kept saying sorry which I understand but I also appreciate more of their honesty and kind hearts."

There were about five people behind the counter but only two were helping customers, the other three were talking to each other. Both of the baristas weren't friendly and my drink was a quarter foam. Not worth the money or time."
541,pTv4RDll3N_CGG3BwtEctg,8/15/2018,2 star rating,"Starbucks has never been my favorite Java place, but when your caffeine tank is running low they'll certainly do in a pinch.  Generally, I've found that regardless of which of their innumerable locations you go to, the quality of the actual coffee doesn't really vary enough to notice.What DOES vary from location to location is the quality of the service, and here the level of service borders on unacceptable.  The normal wait for a latte at your typical 'Bucks is upwards of ten minutes; when I came in here it actually took close to a half an hour!  Couple the glacial speed with the rude, condescending attitude I received from the barrista who waited on me, and I will not be coming back to this location ever again."

Got my ice latte with no problem in 5 minutes but waited for 10 minutes and still didn't see my warm croissant and I went up to ask about it and then a second lady (might be manager or someone that also handle bakery) accuse me of cutting line. I explain that I was just asking about my croissant which I placed with my ice latte and I almost finished my latte and still didn't see my croissant. Then they found my order and ask if I want it to be warmed, I said yes, and then I was told I need to be back in the line and wait like another 10 minutes. Then I just ask them to hand me the croissant cold and I got out of this Starbucks. This is not my usual go to place and this will be my last time going to this Starbucks! Ps: Just notice the croissant was produce almost one month ago. Today is 7/18 and my croissant was produce in 6/24. Never see the wrapper when you ask for warm croissant."
543,pTv4RDll3N_CGG3BwtEctg,12/5/2015,3 star rating,"For me who usually only drinks black coffee and expresso, Its increasingly hard for me to appreciate the quality Starbucks is offering. (From the bean selection, taste, and service quality...) I had 5 customers waiting for their coffees when I just finished my order, and waited another 15 minutes to get my cup after they have been making wrong coffees at least twice for other customers. I have to admit that after trying the new generation of coffee shops like blue spoon (next door) or caffe 1668 (in TriBeCa) where good quality of coffee beans and higher coffee making standard for the similar price offered at Starbucks, I would only choose S if there is no that kind of coffee shops around..."

The cream itself is supposedly made ""in house,"" according to the ads both inside and outside of the store. It tastes NOTHING like the standard sweet creams at other locations. Simply put, there is no element of vanilla nor sweet cream to it. Just straight up cream. Bland, and it's false advertising.

583,idha1p-gDIbkNFF-PfWmEA,3/2/2021,5 star rating,"McKenna's is easily one of my favorite bars in the city. It's one of those go-to, consistently great spots. If you're familiar with the Manhattan bar scene, then you'll know that this kind of genuine place is super hard to come by and you latch on when you find it.I've come to McKenna's to pregame a night out, have a last drink before heading home, and for an entire night... and day. The bartenders are awesome, the drinks are strong (and there's a lot to choose from), and the food is REALLY good. If you're just looking for a drink (or 5) or you want drinks with the option of a meal, this is definitely a good spot for you.Now, for the vibe. The bar is big and has tons of seating. There are tables and booths throughout, too. One of my favorite things about McKenna's is how they celebrate/decorate for the holidays. Being an Irish bar, they go all out with food and drinks for St. Patty's. It's a can't miss event!I haven't been during covid because I unfortunately haven't been back in the city. They're still open and have added new drink specials like buckets and pitchers. Whenever I'm back, I will definitely make sure to grab a drink and a bite!!"

I'm glad that there's a Aunt Annie's in Rego Center and their location is great too. It doesn't require to walk along the outskirts of the building like Miller's Ale House, Chipotle, or Subway. It's right by escalators and elevators. They accept credit, cash but no bills larger than $50."

They lose their freshness and it affect their taste. If they are just out of the oven, be prepared for a real candy ;)PS: I would give up on their coffee. The best bagel, the worst coffee..."

The cinnamon sugar sticks are great for dipping too. Of course don't forget to ask for some extra sweet glaze!To wash this gluttonous treat down, I'd suggest the either the traditional lemonade or blue-raspberry lemonade. Enjoy!"

601,AxpsI4_tOI0sM6-KfOY9ig,11/1/2022,4 star rating,"Ma-po tofu (4/5) - $14The Ma-po Tofu is silk tofu with minced beef in spicy chili sauce. The chili sauce was a bit spicy but tolerable. Very flavorful and goes very well with rice. La-zi chicken (4/5) - $19The stir fried diced chicken with dry red chili pepper was pretty spicy. If you want to lesson the spice, they can add extra cashews to lower the spice level. The red chili pepper aren't dried red pepper so it is extra spicy if you eat it. I would recommend if you can tolerate the heat.  Ma-La Beef (4/5) - $23The Ma-La Beef is slice beef with red chili oil and peppercorn. The slice beef is thicker than the hotpot beef. For me this was the spiciest dish because of the peppercorn it numbed my tongue. Ma-La Prawn (4.5/5) - $20The Ma-La Prawn are stir fried shell on shrimps with dried chili and peppercorn. This was my favorite dish. It has enough spice to make my tongue tingle but not overly spicy. The shrimps were pretty big for the size and a nice crunch on the shell.

The decor inside is stunning - beautiful dark wood notes and bamboo - as was the tea set at each table, but the service was slow / not really attentive, and the food we thought was good but not great. We ordered the Mung Bean Jelly, which came nicely presented, but the jelly was too thick, texturally too hard, and the sauce didn't add enough flavor. We also ordered the Double Cooked Pork (not great - the pork was a bit tough and too thickly sliced), the Long Beans w/ Eggplant (pretty good), and the Mixed Pepper w/ Cony Meat (not bad, but not much cony meat). The entrees are the in the $20-30 range, but portions are small. Overall, the food here isn't bad, but you're definitely paying more for style than substance. Given how many other Sichuanese restaurants are in the area, I'd probably opt for another place first."
603,AxpsI4_tOI0sM6-KfOY9ig,9/12/2022,4 star rating,"Been here a few times pre-pandemic and during the pandemic as well, and I have to say that after eating here this past weekend, the food wasn't as good as I remembered it. Still a pretty good experience considering the nice ambience, service, and overall food taste. However, the value has probably decreased because some of the dishes were very small for the price. I'm not sure if this is because of shrinkflation, but regardless, I feel that there are other Szechuan restaurants in flushing that give you more bang for your buck (with the same or better taste). The good: get the classic appetizer with hanging strips of pork and cucumber over a spicy dipping sauce. Ate too fast and forgot to snap a pic of it. Double cooked pork was good, as was the braised pork belly (although I remember there being cherries in this dish pre-pandemic). My family thought that the pork belly used in these two dishes were excessively fatty but the taste was good. We also ordered the sour beef soup which I personally really enjoyed the taste of. The acidity also helped to cut the grease after all the pork belly. However, the portion size was smaller than the tomato soup (yielded about 5 small bowls). Bonus: the jasmine tea here is so so good. Super fragrant and served in beautiful teacups. The pickled cabbage they gift you as an appetizer is also very delicious. The so-so: We had a tomato fish soup with tofu , which was honestly pretty forgettable. It reminded me of the tomato base at HaiDiLao. Good, but imo not worth paying for at a restaurant. Lo mein was also pretty forgettable. I've had better wok hei at take out places. Not recommended: the la zhi ji (chicken with peppers). This is a classic szechuan dish but we were pretty disappointed here because the chicken didn't have any batter around it. As a result, there was very little crunch (if any). Also, the plate was small to begin with, and there were a ton of peppers on the plate and not a lot of chicken. This is the case in many restaurants, but there was a bigger proportion of peppers to chicken here, and the chicken wasn't even crispy. (Go to Lucky Chen for this dish. Executed better there.)"

Loveedd the vibes in here, the decor was beautiful. The cabbage appetizer they give you in the beginning is very spicy! Beware if you can't handle spice. I had a few pieces in moderation haha. We ordered the swing pork belly, which was amazing! This is a must get cold appetizer if you come here. The garlic hot oil sauce went really well with the pork belly and cucumber! I saw a bunch of pictures of this and glad we tried it. The sauteed chinese long beans w eggplant was also good. My brother really wanted the Mala beef, but we weren't big fans of it. He thought the beef would be brisket (thinking it would be like dry hotpot style). Would pass on this next time- the flavor was good but we aren't big fans of this type of beef. My cousin really wanted to get the szechuan pickled cabbage and fish. This is definitely special- I know this is quite popular but personally wasn't a fan! I don't loove pickled cabbage so this was way too sour for my taste.Would definitely come back and try a few other things though"

I wasn't sure how I would cope as I know Szechuan food can be very expensive but we were able to order mildly spicy foods and delicious. The cold chicken dish was just enough spiciness and very flavorful. The beef with potatoes and okra salad were all tasty and unique. The jelly fish is the real deal..very authentic! I will be coming back and try some more of their traditional dishes. I have a feeling it would be just as delicious.

The crust is usually thick but airy with a square pie but the crust on this pie was thick and heavy, like lead. The cheese was not much better, it was like a glob sitting on top of the heavy, bad tasting crust.I called to complain but whoever answered seemed disinterested in my complaint. For almost $40.00 for a salad and pie I was expecting a better experience.Come on La Villa, you can do better than that!!!"

The fried zucchini app was amazing as always and I got minestrone soup in a bowl larger than my head which was also very delicious. The bread service is still fantastic and I ate way more bread than I should have. The pasta was good and so was the calzone that was the size of a 3 month old.

Got pizza Speciale with thick crust, large for $29. It was HUGE. Definitely great for 3-4 people to share. We took leftovers home. Thick crust was a bit too much dough for my personal liking. But at least it was tasty. The flavors were vibrant. Really enjoyed the savory sausage/pepperoni/mushroom notes mixed with sweet bell pepper and caramelized onions.

Apparently they didn't have prosciutto so instead of calling us and allowing us to change the order they sent a pizza with just veggies!!! Just veggies!!!And when we complained to the delivery service they just issued a refund of the one topping. Without the meat the pizza sucked- it was borderline inedible! Sucked!

Bibi H who served me was not a good person nor was she even willing to help out anyone. I asked for 2 breakfast sandwiches no cheese panini's. Instead I got 2 on bagels. I am diabetic so bagels are not good for me nor did I even ask for a bagel sandwich. Also when she told me the price for 2 sandwich's and a large coffee it came out to be $33.72When I asked her to remove 1 sandwich she threw a hissy fit so I just said ok don't worry about it I'll take it. All she had to do is ouch some buttons and take off one sandwich but her fingers musta be broken. The sandwich in the end was not even worth the $12.99 dollars each. Please don't even bother with this place it's a rip off. It seems in Covid times there prices were Jack up.

The vegan options in this airport are extremely limited, especially considering it is in a major city, in 2017. Fortunately, at La Brea Bakery you can get a solid vegan meal and coffee for under $10. They also have various non-vegan panini, pre-packaged salads, and baked goods as well.I really enjoyed my sesame bagel with avocado and tomato. The bread was fresh and had the perfect hearty, chewy texture that everyone loves about NYC bagels. The avocado and tomato slices were perfectly ripe. My iced coffee was surprisingly fantastic, full of smooth espresso flavor, balanced by their organic soy milk (available upon request). I hope that in the future, they will consider offering more vegan toppings, such as tofu cream cheese or even peanut butter for the bagels. The Middle Eastern ladies working here are very friendly and accommodating. Conveniently located in Terminal 4 (Delta)."
629,U8Ljrx-w5otdMZNFhw5piw,8/18/2019,1 star rating,This place is very disorganized.   I ordered a roasted veggie panini. I received a sandwich with ice cold veggies and the cheese was still in slice form.  One side of the sandwich looked slightly toasted and the other side was completely soggy with no signs of being toasted. I took it back and showed them. They made me a new one in half the time it took the first one. The edges of the sandwich were piping hot. The middle was ice cold again and the bread was not even toasted. I dont recommend wasting $15 on a 'panini' here. Terrible.

So good you can taste the chard from the brick oven, great balance of all flavors and that crust! To die for. Once you walk inside you smell the brick oven...The drinks are well made- you can order most virgin if it's something you are into. I had a virgin Italian Mule  A gluten free option would be a nice addition but no biggie! I highly recommend this spot for brick oven pizza at a chill spot."
635,HzmjJ1mM0WdOHbfYm5mxqw,4/1/2023,5 star rating,Amazing on so many levels! Service was 10/10 and our server offered delicious recommendations. We started with the GIANT calamari app - fantastic. Then the two of us split the Spaghetti Carbonara and the Soleluna (half pizza/half calzone). Both tasted so so good! I can't wait to go back and try more!
636,HzmjJ1mM0WdOHbfYm5mxqw,10/24/2022,4 star rating,I was excited to come here because their sister restaurant Soleluna is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in queens.  This is their take on pizza.  This was my first time here so I always try the margarita first to get a good base of what the pizzas will taste like.  We came during happy hour which is from Monday to Thursday fr 4-7 which included a selection of wine and a large peroni for 7 dollars.  It was a Monday around 530 and was already pretty busy.  I had the montepulciano wine which was delicious and went great with the margarita pizza.  The pizza had a nice chewy crust fresh basil and was on the tangy side which I personally enjoy.  We also tried the pasta special which was also delicious.  We also tried the fritto misto which was delicately battered and was soo good I didn't even need to add sauce to it.  I will definitely come back to try more.

This should have been done pre covid but especially now that we are still dealing w residual issues from the virus plus all of it's addtl nightmares like monkey pox, colds, etc. Also the Salsiccia e Friarelli Pizza is one of the better ones on the menu, so I have ordered it a few times; however, on quite a few occasions the broccoli rabe was pretty aggressive. I'm not complaining about the toppings being plentiful but it could be chopped better. Rabe was chunked up and to much for a mouthful. Two things about broccoli rabe when prepared poorly is the it can be bitter and the stems can be tough. In this case, it's the latter and the pizza is honestly less enjoyable when your choking and chewing for too long on a topping."

Got steak instead of chops but definitely will come back for more dishes and their lambchops! Had amazing flavors of gelato at the end for my dessert.

The ice cream mochi was delicious (had some not typical flavors to try) and overall we had a great time chilling while snacking on these sweet treats!My favorite was tiramisu. FYI I'm a sucker for coffee flavored items so that explains it. Lychee was a popular fave with my two other friends. The classic flavors (black sesame, green tea, red bean) were solid. Can't really go wrong with that. The lemon citrus was more icey like, refreshingly sour if you want to pivot from the sweet creamy flavors. We sat outside on the small bench in front because the inside felt rather stuffy. Also seating is quite limited so it's best to come in small parties or take it to go. They don't have knives if you want cut up the mochi some more but they do have spoons. The workers kindly brought the mochi out to us and offered napkins (though a step too late but appreciate it)Also there is a bathroom!"

Though I only had 1 mochi which as the Yuzu Citris, I found it to be bursting with sweet, but not too sweet, fruity Yuzu-y flavors.I also ordered two gift boxes to give to friends and they absolutely loved it. We had to wait a bit because they were actually hand-making the mochi for each order. The way that they package it is very thoughtful (even making sure to include ice) and I personally though the price was solid ($23 per box)."

The moment we stepped in, we were focused on the menu for a solid 10 minutes. We were surprised at all the flavors offered and that was possible for the rice glutenous dessert. We all decided on the build your own 3 flavored full sized mochi skewers. My choices were the black sesame, banana caramel and the strawberry mochi.  All 3 of my mochi flavors were true to their taste. The outer shell was so soft and humble to the first bite. The fillings carried a fusion of cold and fruity, sweet savoryness.  It was a busy day of deliveries as the staff was running around fulfilling lots of online orders but they were very attentive to us and any customers stopping by. My next visit back will have to go with trying the mochi dango skewers. A good chilly squishy sweets moment was what I'd call this night."
647,MHbxF-ZS918-ZoXKQPBEyg,9/21/2022,3 star rating,Mochi was just okay and not thawed enough. I had the lychee and green tea. Lychee could have had a stronger flavor but I still enjoyed it.

We walked in and were standing there for a while and didn't see any workers at all so I was confused as to whether or not they were closed. Turns out they were just all in the back working. We waited quite a while for our mochi to come out as well, I think they are just understaffed in general.The mochi and daifuku were sooo chewy and soft. The daifuku is like a cream cloud, all wrapped into one pillow of goodness. Personally loved the Black Sesame mochi a lot, but wouldn't get the Peanut one again. I was hoping there'd be more peanut chunks/flavor, but instead they put a mini Reese's candy in it (which is interesting but I prefer the authentic peanut taste more)."

Once, they even highly suggested to us to leave.We went on a random Sunday. There seemed to be a class going on as four girls were learning to make mochi from scratch. We each got two mochis. I got the sesame and mint chocolate. My friend got the sesame and tiramisu. I thought by getting just the mochi ice cream, we would get our orders right away, but we had to wait. I think it was to slowly bring the mochi ice cream to room temperature? Unclear. I didn't think they were anything special given the wait. I've had comparable or better store bought mochi. I think next time if it isn't busy, I'll opt for a more special order than just the mochis."

He was rude, short, and not at all friendly or engaging . Not even when I mistakenly gave him my BJs card to use as payment (I thought it was my BOA card). The rest of the evening he spent his time at the opposite end of the bar, serving folks down there smiling and enjoying his job. It just so happened that those folks were Caucasian and the majority of the folks on my end of the bar were Hispanic, Indian and African American like myself. We constantly had to over extend ourselves in order to get his attention. When he would finally come he would be rude and short. We ordered shots and an order fries, they never came. I asked Jack was he ok because he was giving off negative energy. As he was snatching up napkins and straws he rudely informed me that they were short staffed and it was a rough day. I said ""ok but I don't need your attitude"" Jack said ""then fuck off and get the fuck out!"" And walked away. Shocked and appalled I took my complaint to the manager Evelyn who in return said to me ""well I'm not going to take your word for it, there's two sides to every story"" as if I'm going to interrupt my good time with my coworkers to make a false allegation in the middle of a noisy bar. I took offense to both Jack's and Evelyn's behavior. Jack had an extremely poor and negative attitude and customer service the entire night and Evelyn the same when I gave my complaint. I felt that i was treated that way because I'm African American because afterwards saw both Evelyn and Jack laughing and enjoying a good time with my Caucasian coworkers and other white patrons but not giving an ounce of that joy to me or my other minority coworkers. Oddly enough though, the fries finally came and the ended up being on the house. Why thanks! I will never return to that establishment. I told all of my coworkers the negative experience that I had with the bartender Jack and Evelyn the manager. I will also share my experience verbally and on social media. I hope that Full Shilling can expand their staff so that Jack can be more pleasant to the minority patrons."

From my observations, a lot of regulars. The food specials look great (I happened to be there on a day that lamb shank was a special but ordered a turkey burger instead). Let me begin by saying that the turkey burgers here are delicious! Sometimes with a turkey burger it's hit or miss. Sounds like it would be simple enough. Here, it was everything. It wasn't dry at all. The tomato and and lettuce were fresh. I also enjoyed that the bun was slightly toasted. Bathrooms were clean and this may just be my new go to place.

670,oZIo2MOmnd_CML1F11N3Vg,3/30/2016,3 star rating,"The Full Shilling is one of those NY Irish Pubs, that's been around for a while, that's not hip or expensive or trying to serve fancy cocktails or fancy food.  It is what it is - a standard NY Irish pub.What I mean by that, is that if I think of a true Irish pub, without any NY influence, then I'd say the Dead Rabbit nearby is that place.  That being said, it's much more expensive and not as easy to just walk in, grab a pint and sit down for food.  Most of the time you need reservations, it's packed, etc.  Molly's (on 3rd ave) is another authentic Irish Pub, but it's been fairly NY influenced, in my opinion.The Full Shilling on the other hand is user friendly.  You can almost always get a table or seat at the bar, there's no reservations needed and it's never really packed, so you don't have to wait 10 minutes to get your drink or have your drink made.Plus, the Interior of the Bar and the back bar was Shipped directly from Belfast, Ireland and is over 100 Years Old.  So that's pretty cool.I've been coming here since 2003 when I worked nearby at Deutsche Bank, and was definitely one of our after-work spots as there was literally NOTHING in the Financial District, other than a few hole-in-the wall bars at that time.Came here for Lunch on St. Patty's Day 2016.  Got a Guinness & a Burger, both were good.  The Food overall is pretty good pub food, but nothing spectacular.I'd put the Full Shilling in the same category as some of the other NY Irish Pubs in the city (below), although these are my favorites, over the Full Shilling to be honest:  Molly's (on 3rd ave)Paddy Reilly'sLandmark TavernFailtePaddy Maguire'sPuck FairDublin HouseDonovan's Pub (queens)McSorley'sO'Hara'sSo if you're in the Financial District and want something more ""Irish"" then go to Dead Rabbit, and if you want something more ""New Yawk"" then go to O'Hara's, which was the pub of choice for all the 9/11 Responders (NY cops, firemen, etc.).But, if you're looking for a good blend, a ""NY Irish Pub"", which is something down the middle, then the Full Shilling is a great option."

We had chicken udon/soba soup, rock shrimp, shumai, kani salad, gyoza, sashimi, and special rolls. Everything was delicious. Only thing I didn't like was the seaweed salad that tasted off. We will absolutely be back! For only $30 pp and you can keep on ordering as much as you like but just don't go overboard since they don't allow you to take anything home, and it says they charge for overage. Although we had a couple pieces of leftover rice that we picked out fish from the sushi, they didn't say anything about. This will be our new go to sushi spot! Had we gone to Fushimi it would of cost us triple the amount of $$$!They don't have their liquor license so just enjoy the food (or sneak in a Gatorade bottle) lol."
672,qpD22cY8CSXLT2qujiJtqw,12/11/2021,3 star rating,"Came here on a Saturday night and it was pretty much empty except for one other table. We were seated in the back so it felt like we had the entire restaurant to ourselves. We ordered from the ayce menu, which is two sheets of paper. One consisted of the appetizers,  tempura, and dessert, while the other was sushi, sashimi and the rolls. Each adult was $27 pp and after tip and tax it came out to be $100 for 3 people. Not too bad for ayce but missing a drink menu. So if you're looking for sake or beer, you won't find it here.We ordered a number of appetizers to try but didn't take pictures of them all. First we order the rock shrimp which is just fried shrimp with mayo. IF you get the yuzu salmon salad too, dip the rock shrimp into the yuzu sauce and it makes it taste way better. The missing flavor is fulfilled. With that said, we had the yuzu salmon salad which was quite refreshing with the citrus taste of the yuzu. We also had the crab rangoon which wasn't a table favorite as a friend said they did it wrong but it varied among the party. We had chicken nuggets as well which is your typical frozen nuggets from the store. Gyoza had mixed reviews, it was perfectly cooked but someone didn't like the filling. Fried calamari was interesting as the pieces were huge and the sauce was citrusy ad well. The BBQ squid wasn't consistent as some pieces were overcooked but that's due to the different parts of the squid itself. I personally thought the sauce was a little salty and needed rice on the side.The sushi themselves were good as the fish did taste fresh. There is one issue tho...this was mentioned in other reviews... the first round, the fish to rice ratio was pretty good, but when round 2 came along, there was much more rice... The eel sushi wasn't that great either as the sauce was slightly different from the usual you'd get from other places.. to me it was slightly tangy.Edamame was made fresh and wasn't overly salted. The ginger dressing on the salad was the Chinese kind without miso.. or so my friend said...Overall the best part were the squid and red clam. I'm disappointed they didn't have scallop on their menu as it's one of my favorites. The fish was fresh though but the tuna's color wasn't the freshest. Their ice cream was great, green tea had the strong matcha flavor, the red bean tasted like plum which was quite refreshing, and the vanilla reminded me of Kirkland vanilla ice cream... if you know what that tastes like.Service wise was pretty good since there wasn't anyone else there except during the staff's dinner time which they didn't really notice us."

They also saw it was our friends birthday and surprised us with a dessert with a candle and sang happy birthday!! They have a large selection of special rolls and appetizers included in the all you can eat sushi! I would come back again!
678,qpD22cY8CSXLT2qujiJtqw,9/15/2021,5 star rating,"This place is fairly new. We came Wednesday around 5 and it was empty so nice and quiet for us. We got to pick our seats; the kids wanted the booth. Food came out fresh. I'm not sure if everyone gets their food on the boats. I suspect it was because it was empty and because we had kids that they did it, which added to the dining experience.Salmon and avocado chunks in the roll were big and tasted fresh to me. Mango was sweet, so my daughter loved it. We had a bowl of seafood udon soup and it was sweet.The soft shell crab wasn't great so I wouldn't get that again. I can't remember the name of the roll but there was a lobster one with tuna and mango glaze and it was very good.The green tea ice cream was good; strong green tea flavor. The red bean was decent too.Overall I think I would come back here again and it's certainly nice to have an AYCE sushi place in Bay Ridge finally.Sorry, pictures aren't great but you get the idea."
679,qpD22cY8CSXLT2qujiJtqw,9/10/2021,5 star rating,AYCE sushi in bay ridge! The employees here are awesome and work really fast. They are very accurate on making sure your order is correct. The sushi is fresh and the take-out is amazing as well. This place will not leave your wallet hungry!Just note that AYCE won't include every special that is listed on the regular menu. Which is always expected.I'm looking forward to eating in person some time soon!

682,BYOxFf1eg66kWDK8KOvNeQ,4/18/2021,5 star rating,"Ordered online a month ago: 1 banana cream pie slice and some vanilla bean with honey pecan pie ice cream. Both were really good. Savored the Ice cream over a few days, it was so good, surprisingly creamy and rich yet somehow light and not too heavy. Order was quick despite the late time."

I was actually gifted some pies from here and I was shocked when I tried them, please be sure to take their ice cream along with your pies as they seem to have been manufactured to compliment them. Pumpkin Pie: scrumptious in flavor and perfect balance of soft and flavorful. Pear Streusel: my number one fav, very crunchy on top and pear is carefully layered as to not be overwhelming Vanilla Bean Ice Cream: very tasty and will compliment any pie you buy, its actually also tasty and very fresh The pies are in my opinion one of the best that NYC has to offer. It's on my list to try every single one of their flavors and will update once I have."
684,BYOxFf1eg66kWDK8KOvNeQ,6/10/2022,5 star rating,"The best pie in New York City. If I'm around either the Downtown or the Brooklyn location, I am popping in or getting an apple or sour cherry or blueberry (probably the best!) delivered to me, no questions asked. Get the crumble, it's worth it."
685,BYOxFf1eg66kWDK8KOvNeQ,8/19/2019,5 star rating,"I fell in love with Petee's Pies awhile ago and leaned about Petee's Cafe just yesterday. A friend and I were looking for a sweet treat and decided to swing by Petee's in Brooklyn for a slice. It's so cute inside with a cozy feel. Music was playing as slices were served up.  Small tables to sit 2-4 people were lined up against the wall and there was a backyard seating area that was nice as well. I ordered at the counter and was told the pie would come over to me. It came served on an actual dish with real utensils. I'm glad they're doing their part to save the earth. I went with the cherry slice, a scoop of vanilla and whipped cream. It cost a little less than 10 dollars but I was pleased once again. The crust was light brown, buttery and flaky. The cherries were tart and a bit sweet. Just perfect with the ice cream and whipped cream. The slice is a decent size. I'm sure I could have squeezed in one more slice but I controlled myself. I will definitely be back for another delicious visit. Next time I may have a drink with my dessert.  Cocktails, wine and beer are also available for purchase."
686,BYOxFf1eg66kWDK8KOvNeQ,9/8/2019,5 star rating,"This one is just as good as the Petee's on Delancy! The edge this one has over the other is the outdoor seating in the back as well as more indoor seating. I had the peach pie, which was fresh and delicious. The banana cream pie was also a big winner here; the banana custard filling was light and sweet. I enjoyed both pies. I'm eager to try the other flavors. As I mentioned in the other Petee's review, this pie is not cheap, but it's probably the best pie spot around. Price: 3/5Quality: 5/5Quantity: 5/5Atmosphere: 5/5Service: 5/5"
687,BYOxFf1eg66kWDK8KOvNeQ,7/5/2019,5 star rating,How is it possible that the wild Maine blueberry crumb pie got even better the next day? I just don't understand how this sort of magic exists. I love Petee's because they don't overcompensate with too much sugar. It's all about the perfect flake and crumb texture. The freshness of the ingredients they use is apparent. I really had trouble keeping my serving size to one slice. Thanks for reminding me how summer should taste.
688,BYOxFf1eg66kWDK8KOvNeQ,9/7/2020,5 star rating,Wild. Blueberry. Crumb. Pie. What in the filthy nasty thoughts is this business. I started dreaming of times where I had bad dates in this area. I could have had pie instead. Are you kidding me.... well life lesson learned today. If on Myrtle and having a bad or boring date.  Drop to the floor and crawl out to pie safety.
689,BYOxFf1eg66kWDK8KOvNeQ,12/2/2020,5 star rating,LOOOOVED the pie!!!! What a great place.  So many great choices.  Pies tasted fresh like a loving grandma made it just for me...  The vanilla ice cream delish!  Super creamy and great flavor.  Went perfect with our pies.  The crust on pie is buttery and well cooked...flaky crust just made me very happy.  We are definately ordering again...probably eat our way through menu lol

701,K6x7wyqA2iOBjWIhMvOBVQ,10/22/2020,1 star rating,Don't waste your time with this one. Slow and baristas are rude.  Was visiting Washington square and wanted a drink. So we walked over here for a coffee. Line did not move in 10 minutes. Tried to order on the app and this store doesn't have it. Finally my daughter had to use the restroom so I asked where it was and got an attitude from the barista. She said they were closed to the public. Seriously?!  Ok so I asked her where there was a public restroom and she said snottily not here!  We left. I can get coffee from anywhere and I don't need to pay $10 for two drink and get rude service.

706,K6x7wyqA2iOBjWIhMvOBVQ,12/16/2019,1 star rating,Literally the worst Starbucks EVER.  One time they made my drink with soymilk (I asked for nonfat and cannot have soymilk because it makes me sick) and when I politely asked them to remake it they refused.  I had to ask three people and got no help.  Waste of $6 for a Venti latte.  Also they're always out of almond milk.  How is this even possible.  The line is always insanely long.  And their straws are not the standard Starbucks plastic ones.  They're weird environmentally friendly ones but they're super flimsy.  Also it always smells weird here.  Absolutely horrible.
707,K6x7wyqA2iOBjWIhMvOBVQ,11/2/2016,2 star rating,"Wow, this Starbucks is insane. My sister dropped me off here while she was in class so I could get some work done on the wifi. There is a constant line, not only in the ordering line, but also in the mobile pickup line. When my sister and I entered the Starbucks, we walked to the back corner of the shop, which was where the long winding line ended.Once at the front, you can tell the baristas are frazzled. This is probably a higher stress job than working on Wall Street. Omg. The line never ends. I asked for a bathroom key - they will hand you a huge wooden block attached to the key in exchange for your driver's license/ID. It took a while for someone to hand it to me... I stood aside for a while waiting for someone to remember my request.  The bathroom was in a deserted hallway, which was pretty creepy. I'm just glad it wasn't nighttime. This is NOT your typical Starbucks. There is no Starbucks Wifi (if there was, my laptop and my phones couldn't find it). This is probably very convenient location-wise for students at NYU, as they can also use their meal plans on their way to class. However, there is no reason for any normal person to enjoy a cup of coffee or get work done here."

I finished my drink and now I'm having shakes and jitters and it's affecting me at work.Next time you mess up an order just make it over. It's better than accidentally making a customer sick."
710,K6x7wyqA2iOBjWIhMvOBVQ,12/5/2018,1 star rating,"Whatever you do, do not step foot in this Starbucks. Since starting at NYU in August, I have dealt with their constant rudeness and lack of respect for their customers, but today ends my time going back here. I ordered a berry hibiscus refresher, and they gave me instead a dragonfruit acai refresher when they called out my name at the other side. After tasting it (I always taste my drinks here before leaving since they are quite often watered down or made incorrectly) I noticed that this was not the drink I ordered, so I asked the barista if they made the correct drink. The barista said yes, it's the berry refresher, and then I said that it tastes and looks like the dragonfruit one (which I do not like, which is why I made a fuss in the first place). The barista showed me the juice bottle he used (which was the dragonfruit acai bottle) without any explanation, and it was clear that he not only made the wrong drink but refused to admit he made the wrong one. Realizing that they would not change it for me, and being in a rush, I left. Now, I am left with an expensive drink that I do not like. This Starbucks has the worst customer service I have ever experienced before, so do yourself a favor and find any other coffee shop nearby instead.Also forgot to mention how mean the workers are. Thanks for always yelling at me!"

However, every seat was taken already by people.As I walked in I hear one of the baristas shouting free frappe for anyone who comes first to get it. The cashier that took my order greeted me but was not very warming. I ordered a caramel macchiato with almond milk. She didn't bother saying thank you or next. She just stared at me until I walked away. I got my drink fairly fast. When I was waiting for my drink, one of the baristas came out with food orders that customers requested and hand delivered it to them. This is the first Starbucks branch where the barista hands the food to the customer. Most Starbucks employees just called the customers name and wait for them to pick it up themselves. The employee who handed me my drink was a lot nicer than the cashier. Overall the environment was very clean but it's a busy branch so it's hard to find seats."

She was the only person there that was actually doing something. This poor girl had to make all the drinks by herself, where at the same time, her coworkers were all standing there doing little something. During the 40+mins wait, that poor girl made like 20 drinks all by herself. Her coworkers, skinny black young girl, standing there pretending she was busy, refused to help out other customers when being asked. Chubby Latino guy, tried to make one drink,  but didn't know how to, asked the short white girl for help, and then went back to the cashier and take orders when there was 1 or two customers there. After he helped the two, he stood by this chubby black lady who was washing and wiping the counter over and over again very slowly, and started chatting and laughing when this poor little white girl was running around making 20+ drinks. I'm not sure if she's being bullied or if it's actually them purposely taking turns like that, but will never come back to this place again. No wonder the ratings here are so low lol.

736,K6x7wyqA2iOBjWIhMvOBVQ,12/16/2019,1 star rating,Literally the worst Starbucks EVER.  One time they made my drink with soymilk (I asked for nonfat and cannot have soymilk because it makes me sick) and when I politely asked them to remake it they refused.  I had to ask three people and got no help.  Waste of $6 for a Venti latte.  Also they're always out of almond milk.  How is this even possible.  The line is always insanely long.  And their straws are not the standard Starbucks plastic ones.  They're weird environmentally friendly ones but they're super flimsy.  Also it always smells weird here.  Absolutely horrible.

There is a constant line, not only in the ordering line, but also in the mobile pickup line. When my sister and I entered the Starbucks, we walked to the back corner of the shop, which was where the long winding line ended.Once at the front, you can tell the baristas are frazzled. This is probably a higher stress job than working on Wall Street. Omg. The line never ends. I asked for a bathroom key - they will hand you a huge wooden block attached to the key in exchange for your driver's license/ID. It took a while for someone to hand it to me... I stood aside for a while waiting for someone to remember my request.  The bathroom was in a deserted hallway, which was pretty creepy. I'm just glad it wasn't nighttime. This is NOT your typical Starbucks. There is no Starbucks Wifi (if there was, my laptop and my phones couldn't find it). This is probably very convenient location-wise for students at NYU, as they can also use their meal plans on their way to class.

Since starting at NYU in August, I have dealt with their constant rudeness and lack of respect for their customers, but today ends my time going back here. I ordered a berry hibiscus refresher, and they gave me instead a dragonfruit acai refresher when they called out my name at the other side. After tasting it (I always taste my drinks here before leaving since they are quite often watered down or made incorrectly) I noticed that this was not the drink I ordered, so I asked the barista if they made the correct drink. The barista said yes, it's the berry refresher, and then I said that it tastes and looks like the dragonfruit one (which I do not like, which is why I made a fuss in the first place). The barista showed me the juice bottle he used (which was the dragonfruit acai bottle) without any explanation, and it was clear that he not only made the wrong drink but refused to admit he made the wrong one. Realizing that they would not change it for me, and being in a rush, I left. Now, I am left with an expensive drink that I do not like. This Starbucks has the worst customer service I have ever experienced before, so do yourself a favor and find any other coffee shop nearby instead.Also forgot to mention how mean the workers are.

However, every seat was taken already by people.As I walked in I hear one of the baristas shouting free frappe for anyone who comes first to get it. The cashier that took my order greeted me but was not very warming. I ordered a caramel macchiato with almond milk. She didn't bother saying thank you or next. She just stared at me until I walked away. I got my drink fairly fast. When I was waiting for my drink, one of the baristas came out with food orders that customers requested and hand delivered it to them. This is the first Starbucks branch where the barista hands the food to the customer. Most Starbucks employees just called the customers name and wait for them to pick it up themselves. The employee who handed me my drink was a lot nicer than the cashier. Overall the environment was very clean but it's a busy branch so it's hard to find seats."

She was the only person there that was actually doing something. This poor girl had to make all the drinks by herself, where at the same time, her coworkers were all standing there doing little something. During the 40+mins wait, that poor girl made like 20 drinks all by herself. Her coworkers, skinny black young girl, standing there pretending she was busy, refused to help out other customers when being asked. Chubby Latino guy, tried to make one drink,  but didn't know how to, asked the short white girl for help, and then went back to the cashier and take orders when there was 1 or two customers there. After he helped the two, he stood by this chubby black lady who was washing and wiping the counter over and over again very slowly, and started chatting and laughing when this poor little white girl was running around making 20+ drinks. I'm not sure if she's being bullied or if it's actually them purposely taking turns like that, but will never come back to this place again. No wonder the ratings here are so low lol.

They have a nice outside seating area that's great on a temperate night like we had. I can't forget to mention that our bartender was super nice! Overall good time."

Here, it's all about simplicity and consistency. Chill vibe, reasonable prices, quiet during the day (you'll catch patrons reading a book), free popcorn, decent outdoor space, and capable bartenders."

The workers are all extremely rude and take forever to acknowledge your presence in their establishment. Try the lamb kofta with hummus and rice ...pricey at $18 but worth it."

793,_-89MKTICre2Gj6Mq-qhDA,1/8/2022,4 star rating,"I heard raving reviews about the food from friends, and read many other mixed reviews that stated the service was awful. Here's my experience, went with 3 of my friends on a Friday night after work. Expect a LOT of waiting. We waited 30+ minutes for a table (it gets really busy, with people dining in, to-go orders, as well as people picking up) so that's understandable. We didn't mind. It's Steinway after all. We killed some time sipping chai next door at The Gully. After our table was ready, we waited awhile for our menus, and for them to take our order. Our waitress was helpful in giving suggestions etc. Now let's get food- totally worth the wait. We had the chicken kebab platter w/ hummus + rice, chicken adana w/ fries + rice, and a side order of falafel. Everything tasted fresh and amazing. No complaints on the food. Portions are huge as well, and shareable. So I definitely do recommend this spot for authentic delicious middle eastern food. But be prepared to wait. I would go earlier next time."
794,_-89MKTICre2Gj6Mq-qhDA,1/28/2022,4 star rating,"I have to be honest - the place is quite chaotic. The hours posted are not exactly correct, we were turned away when we arrived, but we wanted to try them so bad and came all the way to Astoria already, so we waited an hour and came back. They were out of quite a few items on the menu (including the shawarma) but it's okay. Now to the food - it was really good. So good that I can forget about the chaos, and I will go back. Food's really fresh, and delicious."

Challenging street parking.  Outdoor seating area of restaurant  was closed."

If you're looking to do a pick up order you should order it in advance as there may be some trouble getting it as the pick up is pretty disorganized. The Food overall was pretty good.

The sauces were good and the pickled radish and cucumbers were spot on but probably not homemade. pro tip:  call in your order and eat it elsewhere"
801,3FzpZE56CHuipiY_JDT3EA,12/28/2022,4 star rating,"We were seated fast for a quick bite for lunch, it was a lite healthy meal with lots of options. The biggest complaint I had is we're on the patio and there was a draft of cold air where we were and they were only serving brunch till 4pm. We weren't looking for breakfast food because it was 2 pm so it was basically burgers or salads. The salad was good, the dressing was tasty but nothing special!"
802,3FzpZE56CHuipiY_JDT3EA,3/20/2022,4 star rating,"Westville in general flops between a 3 and a 4 for me. Sometimes, the food is great and it hits the spot where as others it really falls flat for me. In general, I feel like their food can be a little under-seasoned. That being said, I really appreciate that they offer a decent amount of healthy choices and the portions sizes are good. I always end up bringing half home. The reason why I'm giving this location a 4 is because when I was able to dine here outside, it really hit the spot. On this trip, I enjoyed the beets with goat cheese as well as the garlic mash (a staple) and while I'd skip grilled chicken (bland) I would like to try the salmon. This location has some really nice outdoor seating, so take advantage of this if you can!4/5"

It was a little chilly - wish there were a couple of more heat lamps. Each table was separated by a wall so it felt very covid safe. The menus are available as a QR code and the hours are handwritten on each wall.I got the avocado toast and requested a scrambled egg instead of sunny side up. It was pretty good - the avocado tasted fresh and the salad added some nice acidity to the meal. It was surprisingly filling, and I could only eat half of the meal. I shared an order of the fries with my friend, which were really crispy and delicious!I also ordered a hot chocolate, which came in cute glass mug. Because we were outdoors, the drink got cold pretty quickly, but it was good while it was still warm...Overall, nice place with your usual brunch options. There are a few items with small twists on the menu, but otherwise pretty standard."
805,3FzpZE56CHuipiY_JDT3EA,7/21/2022,3 star rating,"To me, this was just a super average, okay brunch spot in Dumbo. I appreciated that their menu was pretty vegetarian/vegan forward, so our table had a ton of options. The Chilaquiles and the French toast counterbalanced; it may have been one of the least-flavored chilaquiles with soggy chips but one of the better crispy French toasts with delicious maple syrups. Pretty much, just a recommendation of what to get & what not to get. Their outdoor patio is pretty nice, but the food in totality is just whatever; your classic brunch place."

Here they have a mix of cheaper and upscale items. There's some things that are super expensive but some things aren't as much. I had the vegan hot dog. It's $12 as a special. This is two hot dogs with chips and a vegetable. Get onions, relish, and sauerkraut for no charge. There's a charge for chili, cheese, and grilled onions. Choices for the vegetable are arugula, fries, or a market vegetable that's available. The vegetables are fresh. Also they have a happy hour that includes good prices on drinks. There's also small bites of cheaper food like nachos, sliders, and more. Has lots of fresh ass food. It has some vegan options. The prices on a few things are very high but they also have specials."

They have a sit down restaurant, but I ordered from their window as I going to go check into my hotel afterwards. Due to the time of the day, they were only serving cheese slices and I wasn't going to order a full pie since I have already eaten breakfast and 4 slices already. But I should have ordered a full pie! So unfortunately I couldn't order pepperoni for my toppings ranking. Patsy's is also cash only. Hands down this was the best crust and sauce I have ever had on a pizza! The crust was extremely fluffy, had amazing flavor, light, and minimal flop. The sauce to cheese ratio was great overall! The sauce was sweet and tangy. The cheese had great flavor! Overall, Patsy's became my new #1 in my pizza rankings. Patsy's ranked slightly above John's of Bleecker Street, Di Fara, and Roberta's.

Hands down this was the best crust and sauce I have ever had on a pizza! The crust was extremely fluffy, had amazing flavor, light, and minimal flop. The sauce to cheese ratio was great overall! The sauce was sweet and tangy. The cheese had great flavor! Overall, Patsy's became my new #1 in my pizza rankings. Patsy's ranked slightly above John's of Bleecker Street, Di Fara, and Roberta's. I will have to come back for the sit down restaurant and try a full pie! Crust: 10Cheese: 9Sauce: 10Toppings: N/AOverall: 9.33"

843,Kh0-HmlgmVUkRxR55_Vn1g,4/9/2022,5 star rating,"Amazing classic NYC thin crust pizza in East Harlem that is considered one of the icons.  This is also the ORIGINAL location (the other branches do not taste the same - the crusts will dry out once the pies cool whereas they do not on the pies here).  The sauce is light, the cheese layer is thin but has a great chew, and the crust ultra thin and floppy.  A large pie can likely only feed 2 - maybe 1 depending on how hungry you are!  It's a classic - and a must-try for any pizza fan.  They are on Uber Eats which helps since they are a bit of a hike."

This is definitely a must try when you're on the East side of Harlem and craving a bite.  While the pizza is consistently delicious, their other items are nothing to scoff at.  Salads are fresh, calamari, etc, you really can't go wrong. If Patsy's was closer to me, I'd probably be there way more often than I already am.  You just can't beat traditions.  Hit them up for a slice and get a taste of a solid Harlem experience.   I will see you there!"

First, the person at the counter was clearly too preoccupied or uninterested to properly take down the order. In my opinion it was a simple order. It's not that difficult to make a bacon, egg and cheese and a egg and cheese. The first sandwich had no bacon. There was literally one piece of bacon for a whole sandwich and the egg and cheese was merely an egg because adding cheese proved to be such a difficult task . To top it all off, when we approached the cooks regarding the mixup, they refused to add bacon claiming there were 2 strips, which still seemed ridiculous to me for a whole roll and then attempted to add a cold piece of cheese to the other sandwich. So much for great customer service."

881,cKGi-erQrad9lf87VH6cjA,3/3/2021,4 star rating,"I've been meaning to try this place for a while since I love checking out the neighborhood Vietnamese and this has such lovely reviews. We went for dinner on one of the warmer weather days at the tail end of February, though admittedly overestimated how warm it would be. Though they do have outdoor dining, be forewarned that it's not heated. We were dressed well enough for an outdoor walk but not for a long time outdoor sit, so dinner got a bit chilly after a while -- the food made up for it, though. The inside looks very cute so I'd definitely hope to be back at a time when I feel safer about indoor dining again!Friend and I were feeling something light and fresh with the onset of spring around the corner, so bun -- the vermicelli -- was the right choice for both of us. I got the Ha Noi with grilled lemongrass chicken and she got the crispy spring rolls. They came with a generous heaping of meat and vegetables, and of course the classic sauce that I was all too happy to drench my bowl in. Seriously, I was impressed with the amount of chicken my bun came with -- they did not skimp to be sure and the ratio of meat to noodles was almost more than I needed, so I can't complain there. Portion was enough for a light dinner and a leftover lunch the next day.Pretty solid place to satisfy my Viet food craving. The sauce, especially, reminded me of what we'd have in various containers back at home made by my mom. Just watch out for the surprise bean sprouts -- that wasn't on the menu for my dish and that's one of the toppings I'm actually picky about (my light form childhood trauma comes in the shape of bean sprouts hidden in my mom's dishes), so they ended up in my empty sauce bowl instead."

A friend and I ate dinner here and had a small two-person table all to ourselves, nestled along the side of the restaurant among the plants, spaced out from others. There was only a 3-4 minute wait before being seated. Then the service was so quick and everyone made sure to check on us regularly. I started with the crispy vegetable spring rolls and then ordered the crispy seitan as my entree with a Vietnamese iced coffee. Everything was so delicious. I would definitely return, and maybe save room for dessert next time!"
883,cKGi-erQrad9lf87VH6cjA,10/10/2022,1 star rating,"I had an absolutely horrible experience in this establishment recently. I walked in and asked to see a menu. A man rudely told me that there was a menu outside. When I told him that the menu outside was too dimly lit for me to see someone handed him a menu and he threw the menu down on the table in front on front of me. You read that correctly. Instead of putting the menu in my hand he aggressively threw the menu onto the table in front of me.   Without picking up the menu and without saying anything I turned around and left. About a minute later, after I had processed the absolutely incredible rudeness I had just experienced I walked back into the restaurant and asked, ""Why would you throw the menu on the table in front of me like that?"" The guy answered, even more rudely than before, ""That's what I do. I do that to everyone."" At which point I turned and walked out. In shock. Pre-pandemic I had eaten at this restaurant a couple of times. You can be sure that I will NEVER set foot in place again. This was a really terrible, terrible experience. I'm disgusted. If this is how customers are treated they don't deserve the honor of being in the hospitality business."
884,cKGi-erQrad9lf87VH6cjA,5/29/2021,4 star rating,Pricier than what I'm used to for a Vietnamese spot but I guess I'm paying for the neighborhood prices. There's so much on the menu! The menu in person has a lot more than their online menu on the website. Everything was really tasty and flavorful. Unlike anything I've tasted before. I ordered the grilled slices of Berkshire pork chop and the chicken wings as an app. My friend got the chicken pho and the grilled prawns on skewers on sticks as her app. Her pho bowl was huge! The size of her head. I thought this place would be Americanized because it's the only Vietnamese spot near Clinton hill and fort Greene but everything was mouthwatering and flavorful. The portions are really large too. Enough for it to be 2 meals for me. I took off one star because rice does not come with my dish and was not asked if I wanted any when I ordered. I see myself coming here more often and trying everything on the menu!

I'm not all that familiar with Vietnamese cuisine so when a friend asked that I meet him here, I yelped to see what other folks loved. Fellow yelpers: ya'll did not disappoint! I ordered and subsequently decimated the sliced pork shop. The pork was super juicy; full of flavor and cooked perfectly - there was even a subtle char. The veggies that accompany the meat (some pickled, some fresh) afford the opportunity to make lettuce wraps... so I did just that. What a delightful and filling meal! I was really impressed. Ambiance inside is unremarkable but chill and comfortable (I visited on a Saturday for a late lunch/early dinner). The staff was kind, attentive and quick. They take AMEX which is always a plus for me!"

There's pho, banh mi's, salads, soups, noodle dishes, curries, vegetarian options - the works!The space is deceptively large, with a front bar and a huge back area with big booths perfect for larger parties.We started out with the crispy chicken wings, which came 5 to an order. Great flavor, perfectly fried.We also had the shrimp papaya salad, which had a kick to it, but wasn't overwhelmingly spicy. Lots of shrimp too!We also wanted to try the pho, but didn't want to do a bowl each, and they were nice enough to split up an order into two smaller bowls for us (so that's why the bowl looks tiny in my photos!). The classic beef broth was great, with a ton of brisket. Rich broth, just the way it's supposed to be.Lastly, we had the iron pot calamari lemongrass curry, which was definitely the most unique thing we saw on the menu. It was a slightly sour curry and definitely worth trying. Portion was on the smaller side, but great for sharing between two people.The only things I'll fault them for is that it didn't come with rice and we had to order separately, and that service was a little bit spotty when the place filled up.If you're used to hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese places, there may be some sticker shock ($14 for a banh mi, for instance). But the quality of food and ingredients (fresh every day!) is well worth it!"

889,cKGi-erQrad9lf87VH6cjA,9/29/2018,3 star rating,"The food was fine, however, there is a $3 delivery fee. When my food arrived, the delivery man cursed at me - 'are you f*king serious' - for not tipping enough on top of the $3 delivery fee. As someone who orders out often, I'm a fair tipper, and assumed that some portion of the $3 delivery fee (in addition to my tip) would go to the delivery person... apparently not.I called to speak with the manager regarding this negative interaction, and was told to call back later. I replied that I would simply leave my thoughts on Yelp and was told 'ok'.That said, the reviews about POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE are true, which detracts from the overall food experience, no matter how delicious. With so many options to choose from in Fort Greene and beyond, I will likely order elsewhere going forward. The food: Fresh summer rolls $9 (2) Rating: 3/10 Although typically made with shrimp, shrimp was $2 extra... ok Summer rolls are one of my favorite Vietnamese treats and these were terrible. The rice paper was gummy and chewy, the rolls were bland and the fresh herbs (although essential) were nonexistent. I also expected better, larger shrimp for the up-charge. Peanut sauce was watery and flavorless. Thank god for that side of sriracha. Beef pho - $15 Rating: 9/10 The pho broth was fragrant with great depth of flavor. The sliced beef was well-seasoned and supple in texture.I requested the noodles, herbs, bean sprouts and meat to be packaged separately, and was not disappointed. Bonus point for the crispy fried garlic/shallots and for the brown biodegradable paper packaging!"

It came with a little black floating bug and an ice cube and so I told our server that there is something black in my drink. He said, ""Yeah, it's an ice cube.."" like okay thank you for that sir lol My friend asked for tzatziki when his sandwich came out. It took them 30 minutes to bring it out. By the time they did, he already had finished his entire sandwich. We were the only table in the entire restaurant.For my food, I shared the Hummus Lahme which came with pita. This was actually amazing - the flavors were great and the meat was such a nice edition. For my main, I got the Chicken Shawarma Sandwich. Also pretty quality.

This is close to an OSHA violation. The food is good. Watery tabbouleh aside, meats are excellent quality and well prepared. Baba ganoush is not a strong point. Fresh pita is nice, and the zaatar flatbread was pretty good. The lentil soup tasted only of lemon juice.I cannot tell you what anyone in my party of four said for over an hour. I could not hear it. I cannot tell you what the waiter said, because he visited only once. If I needed water, I would have had to go to the bodega across the street. But I digress. Busy night.

First, we ordered some drinks to start. I had gotten some fruity mimosa (I forgot the name/don't see it on their online menu). It came with a little black floating bug and an ice cube and so I told our server that there is something black in my drink. He said, ""Yeah, it's an ice cube.."" like okay thank you for that sir lol My friend asked for tzatziki when his sandwich came out. It took them 30 minutes to bring it out. By the time they did, he already had finished his entire sandwich. We were the only table in the entire restaurant.For my food, I shared the Hummus Lahme which came with pita. This was actually amazing - the flavors were great and the meat was such a nice edition. For my main, I got the Chicken Shawarma Sandwich. Also pretty quality. I wish this place had better service because the food truly is quite good."

This is close to an OSHA violation. The food is good. Watery tabbouleh aside, meats are excellent quality and well prepared. Baba ganoush is not a strong point. Fresh pita is nice, and the zaatar flatbread was pretty good. The lentil soup tasted only of lemon juice.I cannot tell you what anyone in my party of four said for over an hour. I could not hear it. I cannot tell you what the waiter said, because he visited only once. If I needed water, I would have had to go to the bodega across the street. But I digress. Busy night. They have a good, but uneven kitchen. Decent portions, reasonable prices.I would come again on a quieter weeknight."

911,lUpyqsKw-IBqsMgYIHZj7Q,11/28/2021,5 star rating,"I was born and raised in Manhattan and The Old Town Bar just made it to the top of my list of old school NYC bars. High tin ceilings, long wooden bar, friendly staff that has worked there for over 30 years, and locals that know how valuable tradition is. I had the Reuben sandwich for lunch and it was THE BEST I EVER HAD! The corned beef was incredibly tender and fresh. I almost ordered their legendary cheeseburger and will need to come back to check that out. Even the men's room has sturdy vintage urinals ( like McSorleys for those who know). In a city that is constantly under construction, its great to experience a real NYC bar. No posers here."

I can't lie, I was a little skeptical at first since it was a bar and it wasn't very busy at all (to be fair it was right at 12pm so maybe a little early for a lunch crowd). BUT we both had a burger and wow it was easily one of the best burger and fries we have ever had. My dad is very critical of burgers and he even said it's up there with one of the best he's ever had. The fries were hot and fresh, the burger was juicy and the bun was toasted perfectly. Also, he had a cup of chili that he said was really really good as well. If you're in the area, 1000% check this place out. You won't regret it!!!"

It feels like a *real* bar.  TV wasn't on. Music was low. Sign up front says 'No Cell Phones'.  Just folks having calm conversations, and even a woman reading.  We went mid-day, mid-week, and about half the seats were full - I feel like by mostly locals.  Bartender went out of his way to take care of us. I'm sure we smelled of 'Tourist'. He had a great personality. Clean cut and smart.  I had a whiskey and then a beer. Then another whiskey. And another beer. (It's a bar.)If ever you know I am in NYC and you can't find me, I'm at Old Town Bar."
916,lUpyqsKw-IBqsMgYIHZj7Q,8/29/2021,4 star rating,Old Town is one of the last holdouts of old school NYC Bars & Restaurants!

We didn't eat though the menu had a lot of things we thought about getting as snacks to go with our drinks. Service was great and they have a decent selection of beers (including no shortage of German stuff for some reason or another). I think it's the first place I've ever been that has so much information about its urinals posted, but they're part of the history of the joint, and date from 1910. They're so significant they did some kind of event for their 100th Anniversary."

Krush is on the 4th floor of a building, and it can get extremely crowded by 11 pm. One side of the space reminds me of a college frat party with 4 tables for beer pong, while the other side has the bar and tables for sit-down groups. It can get very loud (not sure how anyone in the building sleeps) and it took a while for bartenders to take our orders. Drinks were reasonably priced, and we got a mix of fruity cocktails to Corona beers. The kimchi fries were delicious, perfect for late night drunk food. It also comes with mozzarella cheese, ketchup, and an aioli. Overall, I can see the appeal of going to Krush, but I'd prefer to go to other nearby Ktown watering holes."

But long story short Me and a bunch of friends went here after dinner on a Thursday night. The bouncer denied me entry at the gate saying I am drunk. I did not have any drinks that night. All my other friends who were Asians were allowed to enter (i am brown btw). I don't know how such a racist place continues to exist in 21st century. If you have ever suffered racism please avoid this place
924,lUpyqsKw-IBqsMgYIHZj7Q,10/15/2022,1 star rating,One of the worst bars I've been to. Loud music couldn't hear anything. Bartenders had no personality and yelled when the CUSTOMER couldn't hear what they're saying. Drinks were too overpriced. 1/10

Then the bouncer comes in breaks through the door and pick my boyfriend up hits him and harassed him. All while I was just trying to use the bathroom.

930,lUpyqsKw-IBqsMgYIHZj7Q,5/10/2018,3 star rating,"This is a pretty cool bar to come with friends. There are beer pong tables and a large seating area on the other side of the room. However, you do have to buy a pitcher in order to play on the tables. Since my group was larger (6 people) we ordered a few pitchers and proceeded to play. Even though we ordered more pitchers, we weren't allowed to play on the other tables since more customers came in. This was weird since we paid for extra pitchers but we accepted it and decided to just take turns playing on our table. However, when we tried to re-rack after a game the bouncer stopped us and tried to make us leave. We couldn't even have an extra game despite paying more for our beer pong table? Eventually he let us stay but I think the policy around that is just weird. On a side note, I think the fries here are really great."

I told my husband I really didn't want to go back. I wanted to go to Sai today, which is further east on Queens blvd, but unfortunately they were closed (only on Mondays). My 13 year old insisted we give this place another chance. I regret listening to him. I had two hand rolls which were mediocre. Yellowtail and eel. I had some sashimi and sushi. Small portions to be expected for the price. The reason for the 1 star is the spicy scallop roll. The roll was cut up into 6 pieces. At least 4 pieces had no scallop at all. I found 4 pieces of scallop in the other two which was smaller than the size of my pinky nail. They mixed so much of the crunch crap in this roll it should have been called spicy crunch crap roll. I dissected the roll and the waitresses looked embarrassed. My husband and son ordered two rolls each. And left half of each of their rolls. So much rice not enough fish. Service was fine. I said it once I'll say it again...I'm not coming back here."

Not sure if just me but sushi is not fresh and does not exceed my expectations now."
934,Q02uPdw8j8yDIVSPyJATjA,6/11/2021,4 star rating,"We discovered this place during quarantine as a cheaper sushi spot & after giving it a try I do agree w previous reviews on one thing their prices they do have very reasonable prices in comparison. First time around we got NY roll & Spider rolls both good NY roll is simple good combo the salmon & shrimp in the spider roll we liked the Fried crab. Specialty rolls had the Paradise & Caribbean rolls , paradise is overly stuffed not bad taste wise just a lot going here the Caribbean roll was the winner of the night great combo w the crab, eel & shrimp plus its fried so probably why it was the best one. Next time around had the Caribbean again we have declared it a favorite since it's so good for our simple option got the California roll not bad & specialty the Bora Bora roll shrimp, avocado & crunchy crab was a good combo.  Both Manhattan & Shrimp tempura Rolls also good. Also tried the Chicken Lollipop fried chicken very good on its own better dipped w the sweet chili sauce, good Dumplings & good Rock Shrimp tempura. This place is not bad at all very reasonable prices , good selection , we ordered though seamless & so far had no issues this was great find for decent sushi to go we enjoyed it & chances are will continue to get take out from here."

Light years cheaper and also TASTIER than other spots! I mean it sounds to good to be true, but I'm no longer a skeptic! This is definitely a place to order from during this crisis as it hits all my personal sushi notes: Tasty, Reasonably Priced and FRESH. So wonderful to have a place that indulges my sushi cravings and shows up right at my door step! Definitely taking a visit once this crisis is over. Overall, I highly recommend this place! I truly don't believe you'll find tastier sushi than this at this price point or as fresh. It's truly the best at it's price point, just not the best I've ever had, but in all fairness I'm still waiting for the ""one"" that blows my socks off. Until then, I have this absolutely wonderful place to always look forward to!  So good!"

However, last night it was one of those moment. Ordering from uberEats, pretty good timing, around 8 almost 9PM because they close at 9:30. Ordered a Bentobox and some ice cream and what I got is truly disappointing. I have ordered from Sushi Island a lot, so i'm very familiar with their products. What I got from my BentoBox was in a bento lunch box, very small portion of Salmon, the ice cream was pretty much melted, I get it maybe because it's a delivery, but I know this is not only because of temperature but because it's old. If you see older pictures of others' order , it's totally different. So, that was very disappointing. I'm not sure if they just start lacking in being consistent or was it just because it was late? Though it wasn't late because I ordered 30-45 mins before they're closing. So, you decide. Below are the pictures I have attached."

Food was good, the only bad thing I have to say is that the california roll (crab) was extremely fishy. We ask to please change it for another roll and the waitress did not bother to help us and ignore our request saying that the crab was fresh. She did not acknowledge our concern."
940,Q02uPdw8j8yDIVSPyJATjA,5/7/2021,2 star rating,"This place is very popular with their $1 sashimi and $3 sushi façade so expect to wait a while to pick up your order especially when they don't have a good system in place. Our food was just sitting there but because the facility was so small, only one person at a time could enter. This is fine due to covid but their system of handing out food sucked. If someone's order wasn't ready, instead of telling them to wait outside to help the next customer, they just let them chill inside. What also caused a delay was that the waitress was pulling double duty by being the one to give out the food too. We had to wait for her to be done with a dine in customer in order to give her our info, pay etc. Multitasking is fine as long as you're capable of doing it. The establishment itself looked super run down and a little dirty. There were boxes of food from the grocery store everywhere. More importantly, ALL SUSHI IS NOT $3. Only a couple are and the rest are around $4-5. It's still cheaper than other places during dinner hours but not for lunch hours. However, you have Tomo Sushi that has a 3 roll special ALL DAY FOR $12.And after tasting Sushi Island's food, I can attest that Tomo is way better. All of Sushi Island's sushi was just wet and mushy. I got spicy crab, shrimp tempura, spicy shrimp, and avocado mushroom rolls. All the seafood options tasted the same. The avocado disappeared in my mouth because it was too soft so I could tell it was old.The customer service needed some work too because I ordered over the phone and asked for spicy mayo. I checked my bag and didn't see it so when I asked she said it cost an extra .50 but I thought it was included in my total because I ordered it already. She kept insisting no I didn't and I'm sure there was a miscommunication and I could have easily just payed the .50 then but her attitude was so annoying that I left. How hard is it to say ""Our apologies for the inconvenience but something must have been unclear. I'd be happy to ring you up for one etc."" Please save your money and go somewhere else."

Our cocktails were also really good - huge fan of the mojito!

A great place to come for groups and celebrations - different BBQ courses for you to choose from for different sized groups as well as can order more single items as needed! I have brought many different friends visiting here and all have loved it! Fun to grill your own food and gives you a fun activity while enjoying others' company! Gyu-Kaku has fantastic happy hour prices for drinks, and we were lucky enough to come right before it ended and was able to get drinks and happy hour pricing for the value course! I love the Gyu-Kaku salad (and would love to know what that dressing is!) as well as edamame for the side. The beef, pork, and chicken were marinated perfectly as always and so delicious! There is definitely enough food for 2 with this BBQ course. The servers are wonderful and will change your grill every so often to keep it fresh. While other courses come with smores, this one didn't so we ordered it as we always finish our Gyu-Kaku meal with dessert!  I also highly recommend downloading their app as I have gotten lots of free sides or discounts over the years! Love Gyu-Kaku and will always recommend it!"

However, the three item take out meal available for delivery is actually a cool concept worth the occasional buy. $60 a person. 3.75/5 stars as a dinner spot."

I am not fond of chain restaurants and gyu kaku changed my mind!Went for lunch special which is a GREAT DEAL!! For bbq you can chose a set of miso soup, salad and 2 or 3 meats plus rice for a great deal. I did 3 meats for $20 and SUPERB!Meat was so tasty and tender. Sososososo good!!Service is fast and nice. Pretty attentive.Place is clean and going with a stroller they were very accommodating."
947,leYx3XTNEDLn9ezoXjlA5g,6/26/2022,3 star rating,"I like Gyu Kaku - some branches better than others. This particular branch was...ok. I've been to the one in White Plains, and the UWS. Both were extremely clean, and ventilated in that there was a vent on every table. To me, that's as good as outdoor dining, which matters, especially w Covid these days.  This branch wasn't so clean. The tables didn't have individual vents, and with teppanyaki, the food smell sticks to your clothes. So those vents matter. The food was good, but compared to the UWS/White Plains branch, these guys seem to not care as much. The rice (even if it was Japanese rice) was dry and seemed half a day old. The sauce bottles were all sticky. The table was sticky too. I ordered the tuna volcano, and the tuna seemed old, and the crispy rice at the bottom was more chewy than anything. The rest we ordered was ok. So, will I visit Gyu Kaku again? Definitely. Unfortunately, I won't be coming back to this branch."
948,leYx3XTNEDLn9ezoXjlA5g,1/16/2022,4 star rating,"Gyu-Kaku is always a good place to get some BBQ in the city. There are about 2 or 3 locations in Manhattan. The reason I love coming here is that they have a large selection of meats and items. The best part is that they have happy hours from the time they open to 5pm. This includes some of their food items as well as drinks!My boyfriend and I usually get the chef's favorite (serves 2); it comes with miso soup, beef sukiyaki bibimbap, gyu-sushi, kimchi, salad, prime kalbi short rib, skirt steak, filet mignon, ribeye, pork belly, garlic shrimp and broccoli with cheese. Sounds like a lot right? I mean...kinda in that it's a lot of different items but the portions are not that big when it came to the amount of meat that is given. Don't expect to get a pile of meat for each of the bbq items. It's enough if you're a small eater but for my boyfriend and I, we always order MORE food items on the sides, like (our favorite) the spicy tuna volcano, takoyaki, the tuna poke nachos...w/e we are feeling that day. Anyways, the meats are pretty good and tender. You wouldn't ever get served any distasteful ones. My fave bbq meat items were the harami skirt steak and kalbi short rib since they are marinated in sweet soy or miso. So they are very flavorful and would pair great with some plain white rice. But they have brown rice you can order OR have the sukiyaki bibimbap that you get with the chef's favorite. The items always come in a timely manner and the waiters would always let you know exactly how long to cook each meat for. You better listen to if you want the meat to be cooked well...unless you like it burnt and overcooked. ( To each his own tho...). The waiters are always attentive and you can always ask them for assistance. The reason I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 is due to the location. I noticed that each location is a little different. Not sure if it's just me (and my boyfriend) but we noticed in some locations the portion looks a little big smaller?  We are fatasses so maybe we are complaining too much lol . Another thing is that you don't have to worry about smelling like you were sitting in a BBQ place the whole day. They have a system that you do not smell once you enjoyed your meal!! This is great cause like yeah I like BBQ as much as the next person but...I don't want to smell like BBQ...on my way home...on the public transportation! esp. my hair"

952,VXB2v7QVe2APSgeSqpmdGw,3/8/2021,4 star rating,It's  a shame this was my first time at Piquant's Brunch. I thoroughly  enjoyed my time. Upon arrival there was a bit of a wait at the door before someone came to acknowledge  me and take my name down. Once that was done we waited about 10 mins for a table. Our temperature was taken at the door. Once seated downstairs our great waiter came to see if we wanted anything to drink. We opted for the unlimited drink option. I want to say that after my first glass of Mimosa  i was told it was finished and if I wanted to try the sangria. All in all the drinks in my opinion were very weak. I would've rather gotten one great strong drink. As far as the food . Everything was great. I had the steak and eggs and also got an ordered of corn flake crusted French toast. That was YUM! I enjoyed my food. The service was great. Attentive waiter and friendly. I wish they did somewhat of a revamp of the decor and furniture.  If that was done it would definitely  help. I'd  love to come back when the weather is warmer to try the back patio area.

The manager chose not to personally apologize/address this severe health code violation3. The bill reflected no charge for the moldy meal, but no attempt of making right the grave wrong of serving a paying customer, who left their home to eat at Piquant and be served food that most would not feed their dogs. I was appalled, disgusted, and offended by the incident and even more by the management's response.  So on top of risking COVID, customers have to risk food poisoning too? That's what we are doing in 2021?I will never go to piquant and I hope they are dealt with accordingly. They clearly do not have the capacity to remain open and is a risk to public safety.  No aesthetic is worth the experience I had. I am disgusted even writing this review. Stay clear of Piquant."

I would recommend it to anyone. Most of the food is lovely, the only thing I didn't like recently was the crispness of the chicken was too hard to chew. It seemed like it was refried, and the mimosas wasn't proportioned correctly I'm not sure if it was new staff but there was more orange juice than champagne."

Has an outdoor and indoor space with plenty of space for a good amount of tables. The Cocktail menu was nothing special so we decided to do the Bottomless Sangria, It was good had real fruit and good amount of alcohol. The Food wasn't all that, Ordered the chicken and waffles I was told that was one of the highlights. The menu claimed that the waffles came with Strawberries, blackberries or apples (your choosing of course). I chose strawberries and Received strawberry syrup with very tiny strawberry chunks, not real strawberries. The chicken was fried, decent overall. I asked for Ranch and Honey mustard and all they had was Ketchup/BBQ which I thought was weird since they have Salads on their menu so I assumed Ranch would be available. It was a cool one time spot, Nothing special to return to."

I ordered steak and eggs which comes with roasted potatoes and green salad. A ton of food, the steak was cooked as requested medium rare, it was tender and flavorful. My boyfriend ordered French toast which was delicious and not to eggy, I had to take a bite of course. Our sangria were both well made and balanced, he had the red and I had white. This is definitely good spot to stop in for great service and tasty food! I wouldn't mind coming back for dinner to check out the night scene."

The chicken sandwich was really good and my favorite out of all the dishes! Juicy, tender chicken with a yummy chipotle Mayo sauce. My salmon black stone came with some salad, potatoes, and a cup of fruits.

The staff was very lax, they had to keep asking about things that were already asked or told to them and not knowledgeable in their own menu, nor were they accommodating to my allergic needs! NO COMPASSION. I ordered the house salad and made sure they knew not to add the walnuts, it still got in there somehow and they were not kind whatsoever about even seeing me choking and having bloodshot eyes!

I remember when this McDonald's really sucked. It always took forever, lots of attitude--just like everyone else said. Even the fries were bad. And what's McDonald's without good fries, really.Then they closed down for a few months and a week before they reopened, I walked by once and caught a glimpse of the artsy stencils they were putting up on the walls. I think one of them almost looked like Obama. I had to wonder why it was necessary for this McDonald's to take itself THAT seriously just for it to function. The stencils worked, because when this place opened up again it was COMPLETELY different. Everyone behind the counter is always respectful and nice, the service is reasonable even during crowded times and the food is as good as McDonald's gets. And yes, the first time I went I was totally charmed by the jazz they were playing--especially because it wasn't elevator smooth jazz. It was some straight up be-bop, high on psychadelics and heroin jazz. Note to 90% of NYC bars: be more like this McDonald's.I also love how many people were as taken with the jazz as I was. Look at us, we some yuppies for real!The last time I went, around 10am on a Saturday, two older Caribbean men waiting for their food in front of me started up a discussion about politics that quickly made an existential turn into a debate about faith. One of them was defiant in his belief in a divine greater power but not in any single religion. The other guy refused to accept this and stormed away with his Hot Cakes. Behind me, two old ladies sipped their coffee gossiping about a girl who just got pregnant. I got all the tea just standing there waiting for my Egg McMuffin! Trust me when I say this McDonald's is poppin. Thank you, stencils."

I decided to go for it and switched up my fries for totes because you always switch to totes if you have the chance. My husband got the buttermilk chicken salad, and my friends ordered the Faros salad and a margherita pizza with extra ricotta.Everyone enjoyed their food - the salad was seemingly endless. I really enjoyed the Beyond burger.

It was juicy and flavorful. The tots thought were so so good.

They definitely stepped up their food game because a few years ago it was mostly bar food. Now their menu has wings, burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, salads and sides. Honestly for a place known as a beer garden, their food is also pretty tasty. My husband had the fried chicken sandwich which was really good. I had the butternut squash soup (it was cold that day!) and it was also very good. My daughter had the chicken fingers which she liked but I think it's a tad over fried. The fries were ok because it wasn't as crispy but the onion rings were really good.I've had their wings before (pre-Covid) and thought it was well made but since we ended up coming here on a cold night, I didn't want to get down and dirty with wings. Plus, I didn't want to eat with my hands. (again, Covid)They have a huge beer list (duh...beer garden) and some cocktails, wine and sangria.

We were six feet from other people, and there was enough seating for a lot of small groups.Their pizza was solid, and the burgers were about what I'd expect from any pub or bar. Nachos were good too. The biggest downside is that we felt like we were waiting forever for our food to come out. It seems like for a giant place, they didn't have a big enough kitchen or kitchen staff to accommodate it. Our food did come out after about 30-40 minutes, and it's worth noting that it was pretty busy but not packed."

Every time I come to Pelicana I get the same thing I get an original or crispy chicken sandwich with honey mayo, the cabbage and no pickles.. It's so good. I also recommend getting the french fries with a cheese topper on it it is unmatched.. Sidenote; Pelicana chicken offers its customers coupons and if you get five coupons you get free order of french fries and if you get 10 coupons you get a free order of wings. as a foodie I appreciate that because like I said earlier I come to this place a lot so if I can get free food off of being loyal then I'm here for it!"

I usually get the sauce on the side so it does not get soggy. This location gets pretty packed at night but seems like a great place for small groups to grab dinner. Love the parmesan truffle fries and the kimchi fried rice is pretty good too!

The portion size is great, I especially love how the chef thinly slices the green n red peppers (I loathe thick chunks of these items and my onions also).  The chicken was perfectly spiced and not overcooked and in fact juicy.  The biggest compliment is the avocado  not many people know how to pick a perfectly ripe avocado but Pelicana never lets me down.Dressing is always nicely taped in its tiny container on top of the plastic salad bowl so now worries about it dripping all over the place.Staff is always friendly and helpful and will answers any questions you have about any items on the menu.  Feel free to order thru seemless for pickup or delivery (they often allow you a discount if you order during certain hours).  You can't go wrong with this rs"

It'd be worth the money if you at least got a bigger portion, but for so much money you don't get a lot and what you get doesn't taste like much."

The loaded fries were saucy, crunchy, and savory, but a bit salty.Would definitely come again to try more dishes."

There's no place to sit or wait, your order, wait outside and pick up your drink from Tiger's mouth when it's ready. But the store makes good drinks. I liked my brown sugar milk tea, bubbles were fresh and chewy. I was able to change the ice level, but sugar level cannot be changed. This place is not very crowded, so maybe a good alternative, if other boba places are packed."

You ordered from the left side and then grabbed your drink from the dragon's mouth. The customer service was friendly and very quick with our drinks. What I got was the Biao brown Sugar boba with foam milk or #1. My boyfriend got the passion fruit tea. I honestly loved what I ordered it wasn't super sweet like any other places I've been to. Most places I've been to either put too much brown sugar or their boba is too sweet. This place got it down nicely where I enjoyed my brown sugar boba drink a lot. My boyfriend tried my drink and fell in loved with it a lot. That same night he bugged me to get us the drinks again from Biao Sugar. So I used my Uber eat app to get it delivered to our hotel. The drink was still cold and tasted very delicious as how you would get it in person at the location. I definitely recommend this place if you are into brown sugar boba drink. I would definitely come back and order everyday from this place.

That's one of the reasons I love this place.  I normally pay under $8 for a regular size. Ask for a punch loyalty card! 10 punches and get a free drink! Order your drink and check your number on your receipt.  They will call your number when your drink is ready and then give you your drink through the tigers mouth (see photo).  So cool! I really appreciate the creativity as well as the phenomenal menu/product.  I work down the street and I am concerned about how much $$ I am going to spend here."

It wasn't as brown as the menu photos showed, but you can still taste the coffee. It was a tad bit too sweet for me. I am not sure if you can adjust the sugar levels here. The staff was inattentive and didn't offer the option to so I assume not... At $6.50 + tax, it's pretty average for boba in NYC nowadays. I've had better, but would still recommend it to others if in the area. Their dairy-free options are very, very limited so that's a huge bummer for me."

Keep in mind, the drinks with the egg cup sell out fast each day and only restock at certain times! The drink tastes solid! The brown sugar drink had the perfect amount of sweetness! The concept is cute but if you want to walk around the city and drink it's hard because to drink it, you have to take off the top and sip. Also, there is boba on the bottom so you have to use a straw to drink it to get the boba too."

First off this place is so claustrophobic.. I thought it was cool that there is a tiger that the employees hand drinks out their mouth (pictured below) but it was so hard to record or take pics of the moment because the amount of people inside. Of course it's better to wait outside but we trying to take pictures for the yelp and it was hard.  The pic below is worth a thousand stress.The brown sugar boba milk tea itself was nothing short of normal. It was good but not great. Kinda sweet. It was also expensive but that's NY. But I feel like you can get more value for your money elsewhere. But if you can't find anything else this place isn't bad and perhaps if tiger sugar wasn't so nearby I would choose this place. They also have drinks that tiger sugar might not have!

They close around 10:45pm most days and not on the hour.I had tried a few different drinks. My go to is the oolong tea with milk foam, sometimes I add the boba. Tea tastes fresh and like from tea leaves. The milk or cream also tastes fresh. The boba is just the right consistency. It's about $7-9/drink, which is typical for fresh tea and fresh milk drinks that are not from powder.They have a stamp card. Free 1 after 10 stamps."

As I approached the store, I was surprised to see that there was no line, even though it was a Saturday afternoon.Then, I saw on their menu that they had no Eggs today, all day. And when I got my drink, I noticed that it looked very different from my previous visit, even though I'd ordered the same drink (Biao Brown Sugar Boba Milk w/Milk Foam).This cup was not branded and the color of the drink was different. The drink was still tasty, but it just wasn't the same experience. Perhaps, their quality has dropped. This used to be one of my favorite places in the city, so I hope it comes back again."

Inside is very tiny, but there is enough room for a giant tiger's head to be served out of. Even with a line out the door, we placed our orders and were served within a minute or 2 of paying. My oreo brown sugar boba was tasty! Boba was nice and tender, the tea itself wasn't cloyingly sweet with brown sugar. Just enough to give you that molasses taste which was nice. And the oreo crumb just really made me want to buy a pack of Oreos on the spot. A bit pricy for the size, but really its boba in NYC, what did I expect? Overall, if you have a craving for brown sugar boba and are in the area, give Biao a try!"

But if you're not close by, I'm not sure if this cake is ""unique"" enough for you to make a trip up north just to try it. I like how the carrot cake is not too sweet itself - it's the icing on top that makes it sweet. This way if you prefer your cake not sweet, just avoid the icing. I like texture in my carrot cake. This carrot cake is blended pretty well so you don't really taste the individual ingredients except if you get the raisin and nuts one."

You can also buy a piece by the slice, and they deliver - using ubereats, postmates and nationwide using Goldbelly (frozen and wrapped securely for delivery).  Located in the area on Lexington Avenue with 12 fabulous finds within a couple blocks.  A friend from out of town originally told me when we passed this little storefront that Lloyds was famously known for its carrot cakes (then bought one to take back to the suburbs for family).  Since then, I have brought a few cakes to parties and events, including one this weekend , and everyone always enjoys the amazing cake-- so moist with heavenly sweet cream cheese frosting.

They have two options to choose from: plain or with nuts and raisins. I went with the version with nuts and raisins and think this was the right choice. It's just more interesting chuck full of mix ins. I was pleasantly surprised by how moist the cake was. I took away one star because I did not enjoy the cream cheese frosting. I found it to be cloyingly sweet. The price was reasonable- $4.50 for a generous sized slice! I'm glad to have finally tried this cake and think it's a good place to go if you're in the mood for carrot cake.

It ended up being one of the worst birthday cakes I have ever had. 1) I was horrified when I opened the box. Not only did they pick a bright red that looked terrible against the white cake (couldn't be bothered to mix the food coloring I guess), but the lettering was god awful and ridiculously sloppy and careless. I literally would have done a better job on it had I done it myself. To add insult to injury they couldn't even do something as simple as making it all in one case so I got  ""HAPPy BiRthDAY ZhANE"" ..... I mean you've got to be kidding. Even though my SO ordered it for me 3 days in advance, he still was waiting for over 30 minutes in the shop to receive it so they clearly carelessly rushed through the lettering last minute. After waiting so long he rushed to leave and was embarrassed when we opened the box and saw what they gave us, regretting not checking it when he was there. 2) I was hoping even though they gave me a sloppy looking cake, it would at least be redeemed by tasting good. I was super excited to try the strawberry coconut flavor. Nope. This cake should not be advertised as ""strawberry coconut"". Warning: There is NO coconut flavor in the cake whatsoever. What we got was PLAIN yellow cake. The only coconut is they cover the sides of the cake in coconut flakes and the only strawberry is a layer of strawberry jam in the middle of the two layers. Other than that it's just plain yellow cake. To make it  worse the cake was way overly dense yet they only give a thin layer of buttercream frosting and it had a weird aftertaste. The only part I really enjoyed about this cake was the layer of strawberry jam. As excited as I was to try this place, I unfortunately would never get another cake from here, especially not for a birthday. I'd suggest looking elsewhere unless you want to be disappointed by extremely mediocre cake that you probably could have made better yourself. I don't think anyone goes to a cake place to receive that."

The food has never been a stand out for me, but I keep returning because of their awesome specials. Listen up ladies and gents, they have drink specials until 10pm on Fridays. Yeah, like 3 hours past pretty much every other bar around. The glasses that they use for the mixed drinks are the smaller glasses. (Keep that in mind.)They have a decent amount of outdoor patio seating in the front, which is great for these spring/summer/fall months. Most of my friends and I start at HOTD down the street, and bar hop over here to grab a picnic table outside until 10. After around 10, it gets rowdy and definitely begins to turn into a club. If that's your thing, the downstairs is pretty fun. ( Though I always find it hot with little air circulation...wow I'm getting old if that's my issue at a club.)

I ordered the chili falafel burger for myself, and it was surprisingly tasty and good. I'm not vegan, and the food didn't taste like it was a compromise even without meat. I also got the split pea soup which was good. Almost too good... I'm not sure if this restaurant is completely vegetarian, but if it is then it's even more impressive."

1045,jYjJNB9qlmd6dbYZBaDjfw,9/30/2021,4 star rating,"A good casual place for Mediterranean. It has lots of pitas. Nish Nush has a couple locations with this one being in FiDi. Has a very casual atmosphere. The prices are typically kind of high but nothing that seems out of the ordinary for around here. It has the classic stuff here such as falafel. Just being clear, they actually have three different flavors of falafel. They have the Classic, which is the regular kind everyone knows whoever has been to a Mediterranean restaurant. It also has the Roasted Red Pepper. The final one is the Spinach And Mushroom, which sounds weird. But I'm curious. Maybe soon I will get this. I picked up a Classic Forever. It's $8, kind of a lot for only a sandwich. This comes with Classic flavored falafel, hummus, Israeli salad, and tahini. Has lots of good things and they give you a lot. It makes up for the kind of high prices. There's also a location in Tribeca."
1046,jYjJNB9qlmd6dbYZBaDjfw,9/9/2022,5 star rating,"Got the falafel, eggplant, and grape leaves. Loved the falafel types and the spicy ones had a great kick. The charred was great although a bit oily / greasy. The bottom of the eggplant stack was drenched in oil. The grape leaves were also great."
1047,jYjJNB9qlmd6dbYZBaDjfw,8/19/2022,4 star rating,"If you are in the financial district this a really good food option that you should experience. Their falafels are offered in 3 flavors (Regular, spicy, spinach) all pretty good. Everything here tastes fresh and the sauces are pretty tasty too. Staff is very pleasant as well. TIP: If you are getting the trio sandwich (brings all 3 falafel flavors inside the sandwich) Since all the falafels are mixed you won't really taste the difference in the falafel balls in the sandwich. So get a cheaper sandwich that has 1 falafel flavor or get the trio platter so you can taste the difference in the falafel.The only downside is if your BOB (balling on a budget) like me. Their prices are a bit on the higher side. Falafel sandwich expect to pay $8-$11 depending on sandwich. Their platters are about $12-$14 but are pretty big on hummus, veggies, and you get like 9 falafel balls.  2 light eaters can share it. If you like falafel and vegetarian food options then Nish Nush is recommended specially in this area. @Skinnyfatbastardnyc approves!"

Beers were cold and the bartender gave great service. It was loud with karaoke but it was fun with folks singing along. One of the least expensive places we visited on our trip!

Not Wall Street types.  Good, down to earth patrons winding down after a long day or work week.  Good place to chill, rendezvous.  I believe they have their specials on PBR beer.  Very underrated spot and recommend if you happen to check out before you get on the LIRR, The Garden or any other venue nearby before or after.Grade: B+"

As I chatted it up with a few fine young ladies about this and that, broski kept ordering bourbon and Fireballs, my buddy has an iron constitution and can drink like a man condemned.Two bartenders held down the service as the late croud stumbled in, slightly aggressive in their choice of seats (IE: taken ones) but all in good spirits. Walters has such a homely feel, bartenders add so much too cultivate that feel by giving so much of their time and every single interaction is chock full of smiles and kindness. Not trying to beat a dead horse, but both were top shelf, top of the heap -- tenders of the bar.No food was consumed, but a few red and white paper lined skewered goodies in shallow baskets were set down upon the bar, mid-chest level of a few regulars, or so they seemed too me, as they wrapped arms around their food and two for five dollar Pabst Blue Ribbons like a mother bear sheltering her cubs from any intrusions. Very diverse croud of city folk just talkin, laughing and blowing off some weekly built up work or school steam."

I decided to come in and sit for a spell.They had a special for 2 12 oz cans of PBR (Pabst Blue Ribbon) for $5. Can't get much more of dive bar choice.The decor is wood and looks like the usual dive bar decor. The only thing that spoiled that atmosphere was the vast amount of light entering the bar.The few people there at the time seemed cool. The bartender was professional and friendly.

So I was coming from a long day of work and decided to stop for a drink at molly wee. I had one, and they were closing. I wanted another one, so a older man , and woman I met at the bar were telling me about Walters. We all left, and walked over together. We all went in, I decided to buy the round of drinks. They are old, I was happy to get another drink. Apparently the older man had a previous issues there because he was ""banned"". It had nothing to do with me. It was my first time ever there. The guy bartender you see in the video  cursed me out. He called me all types of names. After I had already paid. I explained to him at the recording I wanted my money back and would leave. It wasn't until I started to record. He yelled at him, and asked him why would he do that to me. I was so embarrassed. look at one girl in front of my recording she had a empty beer. I was mortified. If you listen you her the dialogue, I was calm. The cook comes out drunk, a short African American woman , not even knowing why happened telling me to get out. Then she came outside, and said ""sorry sis, that's how he gets"". I looked at her like she was crazy walked across the street to taboo and left all of them outside arguing."

It was kind of hard to find because all it says is Jameson outside the bar (apparently there was a very low key sign in the front that say Walter's Pub but I totally missed it). All my friends kept telling me was that it was across the street from Taco Bell. LOL. As packed as it is on a typical Friday night, I was more than glad to find out that the girls reserved a table at Walters (huge plus on my books, esp considering that it was a friday night (night after halloween) and most bars usually dont allow a 2 tables reservation). What really blew my mind was that they have a very modern day jukebox that looks like an ipod and random people can just go up and choose different songs they want to hear. I LOVED it!"

Moo shu was gross, but first time daughter order this here and I advised against it to begin with. But it's on their menu so it's on them to cook it, but should have sent it back! All family members not feeling good after dinner I think it was the string beans as that was the common dish. Sorry with all the great options in the city I won't be back."

1068,z311Zsj8goA9SzsoVe_Zxw,10/25/2021,4 star rating,"I was really pleasantly surprised with this spot. I was dragged out here for lunch because apparently the food was good enough that someone wanted to come back after having dinner here for a quick lunch bite. I was expecting like traditional crap Chinese take out. But to be honest, rarely do I ever see legit Chinese food out of China Town (whether it be Manhattan/Queens/or Brooklyn's version of China Town) and this place is the real deal. They have soup dumplings (albeit a tiny bit more expensive here) and my dining companion had shrimp lo mein. Which I'm pretty sure shrimp lo mein is one of his only Chinese food orders he ever gets at this point. (I know this is bastardized American Chinese, I'm getting to my point). But I stole some shrimp and they were good. My soup dumplings were awesome. The dumpling skins were absolute perfection. The meat mixture and broth were delicious. I went the pork route instead of the crab meat mixed in but next time. They're definitely not frozen rest assured because I saw them hand rolling and folding dough in the distance. Definitely a diamond in the rough for Chelsea. I don't know if it's Sichuan per se. We obviously didn't explore the menu in great depth and neither of us ordered anything spicy but they have things on the menu you wouldn't see at any average run of the mill joint. I mean, I never see Xiao LongBao anywhere. So two thumbs up for that alone. God bless. I'll probably be back at some point hungover or drunk in the near and imminent future."

(Calling them boyfriends, etc.)  They tend to get passive aggressive when you don't give the extra attention.  During our last visit, we had to ask for napkins 3 times and got two of the orders wrong even after her writing it down.  On two separate occasions with two different waitresses, they reluctantly wrap up the leftovers at the table and said, ""Next time I'm going to make you put away, ha-ha"".  We're done with this place and are not going back.  We prefer our Moo shoo without a side of harassment!"

I was enjoying some nice views/water when the trifecta hit me- that being hunger, tiredness, and the need to charge my phone because it was about to croak on me. Luckily Elegante served all those needs well. They are one of the only places that accepts credit cards (plus). They had a plug right by the entrance so you can sit and take in some scenery and charge the phone (plus). The service was also very nice and they bring the food to you after you order and you pay at the end. As for the food itself-I have to admit I wasn't a super big fan of the grandmas pizza, it needed an extra minute in the oven. The cheese pizza was divine though. The perfect ratio of  perfectly baked cheese to sauce, greasy but not too greasy, the French fries were crispy and wonderful. And they had Mountain Dew Baja Blast.5/5 will go again"

It is located on Restaurant Row of Rockaway so parking is scare on the main boulevard but plenty of residential parking behind and in front of the business. The inside is rather drab to be honest but it really gives the feel of a no nonsense pizzeria. There is plenty of seating and in the summer this place can get a little bananas. I have been here a couple of times and I have also ordered from here as well. They have a wide variety of pies and I find that their sauce isn't overly sweet-more savory which I personally like. The pies can be a little on the pricey side but if it is good than I don't mind paying for it. Personally anything with eggplant and cheese makes me happy and they are hassle free with customized orders. They even do a dairy free at the clients request.The folks who run the joint are very nice, never had an issue. In fact, during the fiasco government shutdown it was the first business to offer free pizza to furloughed employees (  with a small bucket of Uncle Louie's ice cream ) which I thought was great!Overall? There are loads of pizza places in Rockaways but this place stands for a reason. Give it a try!"

The Lot Radio Kiosk sells coffee and tea drinks and offers casual, rummage sale type furniture as seating.

The Lot Radio backyard lot is my favorite place in Wburg, and I love the ragtag array of benches and chairs, and now at night the fire. That a great radio station and a nice beverages/snack bar can operate in such a small space is impressive, and that it all exists in a shipping container should land them a spot in the DIY HOF.Briefly, for those who complained about the portable restroom, they should consider their histories using portable restrooms--has it been so glamorous? Did you ever notice that they lack plumbing, and that they all have a daily service schedule inside? Can you put those two points together?

Great for small groups or max 5 or so. Loads of regulars and hardly any NYU kids.It's become my friend's meeting spot late and night or to end the night.Currently -- it's decorated in awesome Christmas lights and decorations which makes it even more welcoming.Anyone giving this a one star, probably only enjoys cocktail bars or was outwardly rude to the staff.

So...we spent 3hrs (6pm - 9pm) here. Our first order was paid cash, and I opened a tab on the second order. When we were ready to leave, I asked to close my tab. Come to find out, I was charged for the previous drinks that we paid cash for in addition to the second round. No big deal, people make mistakes, right? Anyways, I brought it to the attention of the bartender who now was a different bartender from the one we ordered from. So she calls the other bartender who was now seated at the bar drinking with the other bar patrons. She comes over and not only tries to make it seem like I'm lying about it, she proceeds to tell me that I was here for 3hrs and only placed two orders Who does that?!? Basically tries to make me feel shitty about only ordering twice! That is NOT how you treat a customer. You are NEVER getting my business again nor will I ever recommend your establishment to anyone I know."

I usually like it but I think I was just too put off by the staff to continue here so we left .After reading past reviews it looks like we were not the first to experience this."

It was called Nancy's Fireside.  It was good then and good now.  I remembered she made a fantastic burger, and I was craving a good burger.  So my husband and I went to Nancy's.  We started out with risotto.  It was creamy and the rice was al dente, perfectly cooked with a huge flavor.  We shared the side dish.  We both ordered cheeseburgers, and we were both totally satisfied. The burgers were cooked perfectly and they were moist and juicy.   It came with fries.  They were OK.   The burger dinner was 14.00 and well worth it. Our waitress was wonderful.  I don't remember her name.  She was friendly and attentive.  She also answered our menu questions. In the past, we have had their seafood and steak and were always very pleased.  I would recommend this restaurant."

1105,Cx-obc_6ZIqr_d7uT7STfQ,11/11/2019,4 star rating,"On the coldest day of the Fall (so far) we headed to Nancy's with good food in mind but found so much more. As we had been working outdoors for a while we were truly frozen right down to our toes. The hostess/waitress/possibly Nancy person lead us to a table right in front of their fireplace (after we answered her question, ""How are you?"" with our one word reply, ""Frozen!"") where we were able to defrost while enjoying our potato soup with bacon. OMG did that hit the spot and help us warm up something fierce. Did I mention it was a late lunch? It was about 2:45 PM and we were truly hungry.Next up we both opted for their delicious burger. I had mine with cheddar and bacon. It was yummy. But I knew that ahead of time because we have been to this lovely little gem of a restaurant previously  Sorry, no photo of the burger because the hour was late and by the time I remembered, the burger was gone. Well half gone. The soup was so filling that I could only get half the burger down. Ironically while reading (originally I wrote eating the menu, lol!) the menu aloud to my Mom, I told her I wanted one of everything on the menu. That just goes to show you that the food choices are extremely attractive and my eyes are bigger than my stomach!I want to mention that Nancy's Restaurant has a lovely cozy vibe to it and makes one feel right at home with delicious food just an order away. In addition, the hostess/waitress/possibly Nancy person is simply delightful and makes it all even more pleasant."

1107,Cx-obc_6ZIqr_d7uT7STfQ,7/27/2019,2 star rating,"When you write a Yelp review, 2 stars literally means ""Meh. I've experienced better.""  In this case, that would be an understatement... but I know that if I ordered something else, and if my waiter had perhaps been more experienced, I likely would have given this restaurant either 3 or maybe 4 stars. Here's the thing... parking is limited on the streets, but the place itself is nice looking. I believe it's adequately staffed, even for a Saturday night. Maybe they can use a ""busboy,"" but if they're not filling the place up, I understand why they would cut that position.I definitely like the atmosphere there. The men's bathroom has more than one urinal and two lovely, large sinks. I found the place to be clean, and the wait staff have a uniform of sorts, and they all had a nice demeanor about them.Bread rolls are served cold. The menus are cute, but a bit confusing (there are 2 pages, one a regular menu, and the other for specials where some of the regular dishes are repeated with slight variations).The waiter starts with a drink order. I got a glass of Riesling, and I was surprised to find that they even had it there. When it came, I was disappointed, as the taste was bittersweet, unlike the typical Riesling... normally my favorite wine. I asked if I could return it... the waiter obliged with no problem, and actually brought me a small sample amount of ""sweet wine"", since that's what I like, but a different brand. I didn't like that one either, and just asked for a ginger ale.When we placed the order for food, I asked for a salad to share with my wife (and an extra plate, of course), and the ""Risotto / Maine Lobster (with corn and baby arugula)"" for 16.95.  I thought this was a pretty decent deal for a lobster!  Still though, it was listed under Appetizers, and I asked if it's really an appetizer. The waiter, a very young guy, said that if I wanted to, I could get it as a main course. Great! After he walked away, I remembered that I really love the tomalley (that disgusting green stuff that's inside the breast of a freshly cooked lobster), so I ran over to him to ask him to be sure that it's left inside, and not discarded.Salad came. It was really, really good. I highly recommend the Arugula Salad if you come here. And not only did they bring the extra plate that I asked for, but they actually split up the salad and the goat cheese for us. It looked fresh and beautiful, and was a very large portion (if it was for one person, it could serve as an entree) and tasted great.  I was only saddened by the news from our waiter that the chef cleans out the lobsters first thing in the morning, so there wouldn't be any tomalley to serve me.Then my Risotto / Maine Lobster arrived. You can check out the photo. I was like ""OMG, they gave me the appetizer as a mistake.""  I asked the waiter just to be sure.  ""Nope...that's the Entree portion.""  It was a decent-sized blob of risotto, topped with about a dozen small chunks of lobster, probably equating to an entire lobster claw cut into 6 pieces, and 6 or so other smallish chunks from an arm. I was blown away... not impressed.Mind you... at no time did we discuss how I wanted it cooked (steamed or boiled or broiled), nor did it say ""Whole Lobster"" anywhere on the menu, and the word ""whole"" never came up in conversation.  I was wondering if the waiter had ever seen this served before, as ""cleaned in the morning"" doesn't usually mean that it comes served as some smallish chunks from a whole lobster.  This means that it was actually COOKED in the morning, then cleaned and probably cut... in the morning. Or maybe it was frozen, and heated as it's requested. I don't know... but man, was I disappointed. The risotto was good... it's not something I was expecting to be my Entree.  I eat Risotto on the side... never as a main dish.My wife's mussels were OK. My dad was really happy with his whole wheat pasta dish. My mom got her Grilled Steak. Having asked for it ""Medium"" but receiving it fairly burnt (some pieces burnt to a complete crisp), she asked to return it. FYI, anything ""blackened"" can contribute to causing cancer. F-that.  (I tried the steak. It was a shame to throw away. It had a nice flavor.) She got the chicken instead, and wasn't really thrilled with it.  We skipped dessert.The check still showed the wine I returned, and while the waiter told me that my risotto/lobster would cost ""no more than $24.95"", I was charged 26.95. He gave me a bit of trouble about taking my Riesling off the check, as I ""drank some."" I pressed on about it, and he removed it from the check, and reduced the lobster to 24.95... but wow, what a rip off. That's the rub. It's not really a bad place, but I ordered the wrong thing, perhaps on the wrong day, and neither the menu or waiter were helpful in communicating to me what I'd be receiving. I hope you have a better experience."

1112,Cx-obc_6ZIqr_d7uT7STfQ,2/17/2020,3 star rating,"I thought the place was ok. The food was good but there were a couple of things I didn't particularly like.First the food: huge portions of tasty hummus and mushrooms. If I am honest, the mushrooms are a little gummy and I think they would be better if chopped a bit smaller. The hummus is good and I definitely cannot complain about the size of the portion. The roasted cauliflower was very tasty. Lots of pita bread, too.On the night I was in the service was really poor. The cashier/server was barely awake. We were the only customers on a Monday night and there was a lot of confusion on our part regarding the drinks and how that all worked since she did not explain it well and the person working the other side of the store was sitting at a table reading and doing what looked like homework. Here's the deal as we now understand it: you cannot purchase alcohol from the restaurant, but you CAN go to the store next door for beer in a cooler. You choose what you want and end up paying for it in the restaurant (part of our confusion) and they do provide glasses but we could not understand why such a strange system. We did not realize until later that the person doing homework worked there. What irritates is the fact we were asking ourselves a lot of questions (again, no one else there, so the place was quiet except for us) about the beers and where to pay and whether we would get a glass...and that person could have answered our questions but simply stayed quiet while we remained confused.We were finishing up our meal and the restaurant was soon to close when we were asked to hurry up and finish. That never sits well, particularly since we were doing our best to get out without inconveniencing the staff. Not sure I would return."

You can't go wrong ordering from their Mediterranean comfort food menu, whether it's a shakshuka or a shawarma bowl. Don't sleep on their desserts either.Like many other restaurants during the pandemic, they've largely pivoted to selling grocery items, I'm guessing because sometimes selling the raw ingredients is the best way to stay afloat while people are dining out less overall, and taking those same ingredients and making them into a meal is just more work than it's worth. Their shelves are completely filled with specialty items like different kinds of oils, pasta, and jams.I love their canned alcoholic drink selection, which includes hard kombucha and hard probiotic sparkling drinks. If you're over drinking White Claws, I'd recommend trying Flying Embers, which they carry here. I also purchased a cornucopia of produce, including jalapenos, lemons, and fruit. They even sell prepared foods like soup and babaganoush in their refrigerated section. Everything was quite fresh.If they are selling freshly baked cookies, you'd be remiss not to buy a few. The tahini shortbread was both buttery and just a touch savory, and I savored every last bite. Mimi's Hummus may not be the Mimi's Hummus of yesteryear, but it's still beloved by the Ditmas Park community. Support your local businesses!"

We shared the tabbouleh salad, mushroom hummus with pita, and mujaddara bowl with beet salad. The tabbouleh salad was light and fresh. The mushroom hummus was tasty and actually really filling, especially with the pita bread. The pita here is one of the best I've had! The mujaddara bowl was so interesting and full of flavor. I also absolutely loved the yogurt it was paired with. Although I typically don't love beets on their own, I enjoyed the beet salad and thought it was a refreshing side, especially next to a lentil-based dish.Despite coming in hungry and ordering just a few items, we were both full at the end of the meal and even had leftovers!

Every once in a while I take a pilgrimage to Flatbush just to go to this restaurant and enjoy the delicious hummus here.First off the Hummus here is the best in NYC. It is super creamy and has a great lemon zing to it. The normal hummus dish also has whole chickpeas and garnish with it to make it a fantastic meal. The simplest hummus dish they have is reason enough to try this place.Atmosphere wise this place is quite intimate. I would say its also romantic with its candles and nice atmosphere though you should expect it be a little cramp as they don't have a lot of inside space. It seems they started adding seating outside which I haven't tried but seems nice.Overall this is (imo) one of the best restaurants in Brooklyn. The service is good, they have great food and great atmosphere. If your in Flatbush I would highly recommend trying this place."

The also have cans of beer and wine which are *perfect* to bring to Prospect Park, which is roughly a mile away. You can't go wrong here."

We recommend the Iraqi pita sandwich, which a good large meal for a vegetarian. Vegans can ask them to leave out the egg. Each component is rich and the strong flavors work well together. My dining companion recommends the kebab flatbread. The humus is, as one would expect, a star here. Try the mushroom! Only complaint is that humus plates only come with one pita, so they're not designed to share. It's a lot of humus for one person... everything is good here, including the baked goods. If you're looking for something not too sweet, take the pistachio or tahini cookies. BTW this is not a kosher place, so check the ingredients."

1142,8mZ6fE9n_mK59mJ_MYtrSQ,5/12/2018,2 star rating,"It's newly opened for about 3 weeks? I gotta say, it was a disappointing experience. After collecting other data, I think it's largely due to management inexperience.I thought it was a restaurant with service sort of thing! Definitely not. Max seating capacity about 20-30 people. The food presented in the pictures currently is also not what we were served. The idea is that the rice dish has been STEAMED with its protein that follows right? Given the size of restaurant, staffing, and popularity, I doubt the authenticity of it. There was a lot of promotion about its discount, about its yumminess, and about how it's a leading trend. However, I think that got out of hand! They're looking for a part time cashier. Which I agree is definitely needed. Orders were backed up, and the poor girl had to manage orders/drinks/angry customers. People were also ordering online, which added to the increased traffic in the kitchen (which I think was 1-2 cooks). Why are you promoting your restaurant when you don't have the necessary staff to keep up with the orders?I think the esteemed rice dishes was made of PRECOOKED rice, dumped into a lotus leaf, poured with protein on top, and steamed for about 5-10 minutes. On a METAL plate, not wooden steamer. This would impart little flavor from leaf no? Because I could not tell the difference in taste, other than the rice being a little fluffier due to steam.The pork belly steamed rice dish - pork belly on point! Not bad. the pork rib rice dish - Meh. It's alright. Fried chicken wing - Yummy. Not crazy about it being a small $1/wing.Curry fishballs - Curry was good. I recommend using the curry later onto your rice. Is the food worth it for the money? Yes. One rice dish can feed 2. No need to tip, due to no actual service, and everything is ""do it yourself"" clean up. PS: I don't know if it'll change, but their bubble tea selection is no different from a cheap Chinese bakery shop type. But come on now, I expected my red bean drink to have actual RED BEANS, not powder. I never seen that before. They also did not have any tapioca. I guess I paid $4 for powder and water. Which tasted like watered down strawberry milk.PS2: I recommend getting the plastic spoon is big, like the ones used for congee. Who thought that a little plastic spoon on a big plate of rice was a good idea?"

Dishes came with free house soup which was very flavorful; questionable amount of MSG/salt in there. The food was mediocre. There was nothing special or good about the food that would warrant me to order again. The chicken had a lot of small shattered bones in between bites; about the size of half a grain of rice. Drinks were overpriced so it was not ordered. Although the establishment has the look and feel of a service restaurant, it's actually semi cafeteria style. Menu items are ordered and paid for first at the counter. You seat yourself and food is then brought to you when ready. Doggy bag available, containers are next to register counter. Help yourself."

From the photos it looked like such authentic comfort food for me and it would've been great to find a place that delivers. Alas. Really flavorless food.We ordered Braised Pork Belly steamer, which according to the photo should be on a bed of preserved vegetables + bokchoi or chinese broccoli. Instead it had no preserved vegetables, barely any of the sauce on the rice, and American broccoli. I don't dislike American broccoli, but it doesn't FIT with these dishes.Also got the Chicken + Mushroom with ginger steamer. Pictured to be served with bok choi, came with broccoli and also flavorless. But there was a large serving of chicken in this one.I don't know how you can make pork belly that's been sitting in soy sauce + spices or chicken covered in ginger + mushroom so tasteless :( Add sauce to the mound of white rice! Serve the pork belly with the salty preserved vegetables! Serve what it looks like in the photos!Fried chicken wings were the only good part of the order. They packaged it correctly and arrived hot + really crispy. The breading they use is substantial and like.. super crunchy. Maybe I'd order the wings again from this place but that's about it.So overall, really disappointing. If you're going to be serving authentic Chinese food, don't cheapen it with American Chinese takeout stuff."

Hubby couldn't stop eating his meal- he got the braised pork and I ordered the garlic shrimp! So good! I wish the shrimp had some gravy you could pour on the rice but overall, we were super impressed- the name of this business does not do it justice- it should be called ""Dope steamed authentic Chinese meals""! ALSO I LOVED the little fried wonton stuffed full of shrimp and pork- yum! 加油"
1148,8mZ6fE9n_mK59mJ_MYtrSQ,3/2/2019,2 star rating,"I saw the advertised pictures of the dishes on social media and decided to give it a try since the food looked authentic and flavorful. Three of us came on a night and ordered 5 different dishes: Garlic Shrimp Lotus Leaf Rice, Braised Pork Belly Lotus Leaf Rice with Preserved Vegetable, Beef Chow Fun, Pop Chicken, and Curry Fish Balls. We also ordered 3 drinks: 2 coffee and 1 ""The Evil"" (brown sugar coffee) drink.Let's start with the food. The Shrimp Lotus Rice's first impression was okay. The garlic shrimp has garlic on top but has NO garlic taste. Shrimps were over-cooked and dried and the vegetables were not the same as advertised (the food was warm and the temperature is not what you would expect from a freshly made dish). The vermicelli noodle was dry and has NO taste/flavor at all. The Rice on the bottom has no Lotus flavor (which should be the main flavor of the dish); the rice tasted as if they just took the rice from rice cooker and placed them on the Lotus Leave and steam for a few minutes with the vermicelli and the garlic shrimps. Overall: there is NO flavor and it was like eating plain rice with plain over-steamed shrimp. The Braised Pork Belly Lotus Rice with preserves vegetable: the pork was okay even though there was not much of the preserved vegetable. The rice was the same as above; tasted plain as from home rice-cooker with just a slight Lotus Leaf taste from the thin top part of the rice. The beef chow fun was okay, not good but not really bad either. It could be improved. The Pop chicken was fried great, crispy and flavorful. The curry fish ball really disappointed me the most. The first moment I put the fish ball into my mouth, there was just plain curry taste with NO salt. Then when you bite into the fish ball, you taste the saltiness of the fish ball itself with the unsalted curry sauce that comes with it. The fish ball tasted chewy as if they fried them before putting them into the curry sauce. It tasted like two different items put together that doesn't go along well. Just want to cover my eyes and finish the food since we paid for it The drinks was the worse part. The two coffee that were given to us tasted extremely watery with some bitterness even with enough sugar added. It was as if we were drinking coffee+water+2% milk. ""The Evil"" drink, which should be their new advertised drink, taste a bit better than the coffee, but this drink looked exactly like the coffee drinks when given to us. This new advertised drink tasted extremely watery as well and only tasted like coffee+water+sugar. I would still give them a 2 stars for serving a variety of Asian style foods, the cute inner design, and their creativity. But I will not go back again and will think twice for trying when looking at pictures advertised on social media."

The food is good but I've had better vegan Chinese food. I really liked the general tsos chicken but the chicken nuggets were not a win for me. They were a little rough/tough and I wasn't a fan of the sauce at all. On the other hand the deserts are AMAZING!! I love the fact they have soy based icecream and SOY MILKSHAKES. I had the Oreo soy milkshake if your not used to soy you won't like it but I LOVED IT!! I mean I would come back here but not for a little bit as it does bring that oily Chinese food factor surprisingly.. Go indulge I highly recommend if you never had vegetarian Chinese!

My gut tells me this is not a new phenomenon driven by the zeitgeist of today's dietary restrictions, since vegan Chinese food has been around for a long time. In any case, this was the highest rated one in the area, and I walked past several similar restaurants for this one, the ""best"" one.My expectations were set low, and they were exceeded. I ordered the curry with seitan, potatoes, carrots, and broccoli. I found the sauce a little too sweet, but the portions were hefty and it was a satisfying enough meal, if you like this cuisine. The chicken nugget appetizer was really tasty even for my carnivorous partner who would never choose ""chick'n"" over the real animal. We also ordered the singapore style noodles, which are hard to mess up and were pretty good.I'm giving them an extra star because of the value delivered. We had enough food to last us two meals, and everything was pretty tasty."

The mains are good too but the appetizers are where it's at. Definitely recommend for vegans, vegetarians, and even our meat-eater friends ask to order from here."

If you're looking for a great place to get delicious bagels and coffee delivered without the drinks spilling and spoiling everything, this is the place. They tightly plastic wrap the entire cup, double cup for sturdiness, and double lid (the inner lid flaps open and close and the outer lid is the one with the natural open spout). There was no drink spillage! I was impressed by their variety of coffee drinks they have to offer. I ended up going with the Dirty Tazo Chai Latte. The coffee delivered was still hot and the drink wasn't too sweet.The egg sandwich was also amazing! I got the 2 egg any style sandwich with a jalapeño bagel, scrambled eggs, American cheese, and turkey. The eggs were light and fluffy, cheese nicely melted within the egg, a great serving of meat, and the softest lightly toasted bagel. I think I've found one of my favorite bagel shops to order from."

The tables were very tightly packed and almost too small for what we ordered, but the food and service was amazing! Tried the Ginger Guava Lemonade cocktail and the Wet Ass Passionfruit. They were both so delicious! For our meal, my friend and I shared the mushroom ribs, and both the Piassa and Mercato platters were amazing! The platters are a great way to try multiple things, definitely hard to pick a favorite between the two, but would recommend deciding based on which veggies you like or don't; eg beets, collard greens Everything was so flavorful and overall very filling. The injera was great. Will definitely be back!"

My usual game plan involves 2 or 3 savory restaurants and 1 or 2 dessert spots. After doing my research on Yelp, I knew I wanted to start our night at Ras Plant Based.We arrived a little after 6 on a Thursday and lucked out that a table was available, they were booked pretty solid. All of the staff were pleasant and our waiter was fantastic. He directed us towards his favorite dishes and they were perfect. We opened up with squash filled pastries. They were perfectly crispy and the dipping sauce had excellent zest. For an entree we went with the seitan on injera. The seitan had great texture in a wonderful sauce, certainly didn't miss meat. The injera itself was perfection, light and airy but substantial enough to wrap the seitan. By the end of the night, one of my regrets was that we didn't order more at Ras.Very cool art on the walls, nice lightning, an all around fun place to eat."
1174,2roGBLPFp4X0sgmWuFEEBQ,9/9/2022,4 star rating,"Short review: Really tasty but pretty pricey food. Get the special tibs. Desserts are excellent with special note going to their choco mango but the rest were not too shabby. The platters are also good with my preference of the two being the mercato due to the nicer variety of textures and I think overall better flavors but the other wasn't bad at all.Anyway, I went to this Ethiopian spot with several others. The prices are a bit high but the quality of the food was overall quite nice especially for vegan or vegetarian food and even as someone who prefers generally eating meat, I still found myself satisfied. It was a little bit loud in there especially with the music but overall the ambience was nice. For a drink, I got the Wet Ass Passion Fruit which contained rum, Vida mezcal, passion fruit, and lime. It was a very tropical cocktail which partially masked the flavor of the rum and it was pretty tasty. We decided to get one of each of the mixed plates for each of our groups along with two of the separate dishes both with injera. Our two main dishes were the Ras Special Tibs with sauteed seitan, tomato, jalapeno, zesty berbere sauce, and onion and our other was the Ras Kitfo with pea protein crumble, spice infused olive oil, and mitmita. Of the two, I preferred the special tibs. It might be because I actually like the texture of seitan or because it would closer to the original meat based dishes. The flavors were also really nice and if I was to go back here alone I would probably get this and one of the appetizers or desserts and be satisfied. The latter didn't exactly taste like kitfo but then again they're trying to imitate a dish made from raw beef tartare mixed with clarified butter and spices but I did like the texture of said dish. I'm usually not a fan of pea protein but in this case it worked quite well. The platters consisted of the following all served on top of injera of course:Mercato:Yatakilt-Cabbage, carrot, onion, bell pepperGomen-Braised collards, sauteed onionsMisisr- Slow simmered red lentil stew, fiery berbere sauceShiro- Creamy ground chickpeas, intricate spice blendFasolia- String beans, carrots, caramelized Onions PiassaKeysir- Savory beetroot, carrot, onionDiffin Misir- Brown lentil, onion, fenugreekYater Kik- Yellow split pea, onion, jalapeno, intricate spice blendAlichi Siro- Mild chickpea, onion, holy basil, garlic, gingerZucchini- Creamy zucchini, tomatoes, carrots, celery, parsley As mentioned in the short review, I preferred the mercato. There was much more variety of textures and outside of the excellent beetroot, I generally found the piassa ones to be blander compared to similar dishes I have found at other Ethiopian spots. Special notes to the braised collards, cabbage, and string beans among the mercato being my favorite of the dishes.For dessert which for some reason is not on their site, we decided to go with three of their vegan cakes. Choco Mango: Cashews, mango, dates, coconut oil, agave, coconut flakes, cacao powder, lemon juice, vanilla extract, Himalayan salt, and freeze-dried raspberryCoconut Leche: Young coconut, cashews, almonds, dates, coconut oil, agave, coconut flakes, sunflower lecithin, vanilla extract, and Himalayan salt Trisome Berry: Cashews, pecans, dates, mixed berries, coconut oil, agave, cacao, lemon juice, raspberry, Himalayan salt, and vanilla I'm generally not a big fan of vegan desserts unless they are naturally vegan and not trying to imitate something else but the ones listed above were a nice change of pace. The choco mango was my preference having a wonderful sourness and a pretty good texture. The coconut leche was a well flavored coconut cake but a bit dry which is expected as there isn't any milk or something similar to make it moist (I presume the oil is for that, maybe some type of plant milk would work.) The trisome berry was also good with some light sourness but it was a bit less flavored and it had a bit of that unpleasant texture I partially expect from most vegan desserts. Overall not shabby and in terms of vegan desserts way better than I expected.Overall the food was pretty tasty especially for vegan food. I would say that it was a bit pricey for the quality but if you're looking for a vegan substitute, this place is quite good. Low 4."
1175,2roGBLPFp4X0sgmWuFEEBQ,8/9/2022,4 star rating,"Extremely delicious vegan Ethiopian food! Flavors are ON POINT and everything just tastes so good! The sambusas are a wonderful appetizer to get- perfectly flaky and crispy. Have tried all the different fillings- veggie, lentil & squash- all on different occasions. All are good! Lentil is more hearty; squash is a bit more unique! The pastry is definitely the best part. They are served piping hot and fresh. The accompanying hot sauce compliments it very well. The platters are a great way to try many different types of dishes. I personally liked the Mercato more than the other platter (since I don't like beets as much). The Mercato platter has a great variety of veggie and legume dishes. All are well-flavored and tasty. I personally loved the cabbage, green beans and red lentil the most. The chickpea dish was the slightly disappointing one- while tasty, it was an extremely small portion. It is a very smooth chickpea purée and almost like a sauce/gravy instead of one of the platter items.I would say the portion was 2-3 tablespoons. Very little and wish that was more generous! Of note- they do not allow any substitutions for the platters. I wish they had an option to choose any 5 items for the platter! That would be awesome and would definitely encourage me to go more often.The mushroom tibs dish was A STAR. Highly recommend. Perfect seasoning + spice from jalapeños. I will definitely be getting the mushroom tibs again. Sooo delicious and went perfectly with the injera. Loved the injera provided- the entrees and platters are served on injera already. You get to choose an  additional starch as well-- more injera, or brown rice. So if you can't decide, you do get injera on the plate already if you did want to try the brown rice. Although I do think for me, injera is one of the main reasons I love eating Ethiopian food because it is so unique to this cuisine- so I want all I can get! It does fill you up for sure. It seems not that filling because it is thin, but the spongy texture + hearty dishes definitely adds up for a very filling meal! If you never had injera, it is slightly sour, due to fermentation. It MAY be an acquired taste, but I feel that it goes very well with the dishes! They drinks were ok. I forgot what my drink was called- it was watermelon with ginger beer. Definitely light and refreshing, but I expected stronger ginger taste. The pineapple coconut rum drink was good- but I expected more pineapple so a bit more tangy. Probably personal preference! It was not bad :) Ambience wise- the vibe is definitely amazing. Vibrant music, live DJ (at least when I went on a weekend), colorful wall paintings, awesome decor etc. Just FYI that it is LOUD in there. It is hard to hear even the person right across you. Don't expect to catch up / have conversations here easily as you will have to talk very loudly the whole meal. Probably a combination of everyone constantly talking at the top of their lungs just to hear each other, adding to the noise. Overall, Ras Plant Based serves amazing, delicious, Ethiopian food that is ALL vegan!! Love this place and will come back for the sambusas and mushroom tibs for sure!"

The food is amazing. The seitan tibs were a favorite and were particularly oily and spicy (you will need some extra injera). I loved the mushroom tibs the most (a fungivore), but loved the traditional cabbage mix, mesir wat, stewed greens and lentils. Everything is always delicious.The cocktails are AMAZING. I had a coconut pineapple drink where I straight up exclaimed after the first sip because I was delighted at how good it was.Crowd pleaser, accessible to everyone unless you have a real pill of a carnivorous omnivore.

There's the familiar dishes I know and love like Missir and Shiro, and then there's Ras Special Tibs and Mama's Tofu that they've invented. Not only are the Tibs some of my favorite Ethiopian, it's also some of my favorite seitan ever! It melts in your mouth. I'm obsessed. The Mercado platter is a go-to as well so you can have tastes of lots of things. The sambusas are big and delicious as well as the tomato fitfit and their hot sauce. We also got the Sorrel Chai which was strong and tasty. I can't deny this is one of my favorite restaurants ever. I'll come every time I visit NY!"

The sambusas were delicious and the sauce was even better. I liked how the Mercato platter had a little bit of everything to try. Could've done without the Ras tibs..it was weirdly sour and the taste got repetitive- wish I got the other platter instead. Got to ordering dessert at around 7:15pm on a Friday night..was little disappointed that there was only one option left. I was excited to try the other desserts but they only had one spicy chocolate cake available. The only way I could describe it is like room temperature ice cream? It had the texture of dense ice cream but of course it wasn't cold. Outdoor seating is heated. Server was friendly :)

I wanted something light before my flight home, I asked our waitress what she liked and she suggested the fried dumplings - SO GOOD! I was able to eat all of them and shared a few with my friend but it was the perfect balance of light but filling. My friend enjoyed her food and even had leftover to take home.The food and staff that work here are awesome.

The wait staff was extremely friendly and recommended the MFC wings half spicy and half mild to try both since it was our first time he also informed us that it was happy hour, it must've been our lucky day. We took our waiters advice and also got an order of truffle fries and dumplings,also half spicy half mild. From first bite we knew we'd love this place, remember that scene from ratatouille when Remy tries cheese and strawberry? Just like that. Everything was amazing, the truffle fries, the dumplings, the chicken was perfectly crispy and tasty. Ever since first bite this spot has become a weekly tradition."

It's always been one of my favorite places to grab a pitcher of beer and order a bunch of wings and drumsticks over some great conversations and challenging each other to see who can eat the most spicy chicken. We've definitely gone mad when it comes to this place. We were so glad to just walk pass a mad for chicken for me to relive the good old days. What's even better was the happy hour everyday 4-7 pm and a free shot from checkin in through Yelp. The chicken was just the same, same flavor, same crunchiness."

Well, of course I had to get a good reel in! I opened up the Yelp app and googled fried chicken near me. Lo and behold this place popped up!The storefront is unassuming. Tinted plate glass with wooden signage. The immediate interior is one large room with a couple of large picnic tables out of an Eddie Bauer catalog and a few smaller tables beyond that. Temperature check!Just over 97. Where're the extra points as my Caribbean mother would say?A hostess led me to one of the picnic tables nearby. (There were only 2 parties there when I walked in at their own private tables.) I thought it was strange since I was a party of 1. I had a fleeting thought that this was one of those communal dining type of places. Not that I would have minded , but I just wanted a quick in and out. (Like everyone else in Wburg.)I ordered a small mixed combo - 3 drumsticks and 5 wings tossed with soy garlic and spicy soy garlic sauce - and a $3 Narragansett can.The back of the space is a split level. On the lower level is the kitchen and restrooms and the upper level has more seating. BTW it's unisex and very clean. They have both air dryers and paper towels.I waited longer than expected for the food,  especially since one of the tables already had theirs. But I guess that really goes to show that everything is made to order, which I appreciated. I must make it a point to mention that the service was excellent. I'll make it a point to go the next time I'm in town!The chicken was delicious! Absolutely delicious. I've had plenty of Korean fried Chicken, BonChon and Krave in CA to name a few, but this was the best I've had so far. There was that extra crunch when you bit into the skin. I don't know... It released the spices and the aroma right away. If the wings weren't screaming hot I would have polished It off in about 5 minutes and probably ordered another set!  These guys truly are mad about chicken, and now, so am I."

I ordered my food around 2045 and waited over 1 hour to get my food(delievery).So, I called directly to this place to confirm my order at 2220. And the employee told me they DID NOT receive the order from grubhub. And we got a message from Grubhub 2 second later that Auntie Anne just cancelled the order.  Lol.... please do not play with customers. Will NEVER order any food from this store."

This location is pretty small (three or four people will fill up the line) and they seem to only ever have original, almond, or hot dog bites in the heating area. I assume that's because they get a lot of foot traffic from Times Square, though it is no less disappointing. I've had the original pretzel twice in the past couple weeks and it's definitely been less fluffier and thinner than at some other locations. It would be nice if they had more varieties available and if the workers were a bit more friendly. I wish the location in Port Authority was still around--at least a couple steps more convenient."

The lady waiting us was very friendly and attentive, and the food was delicious. No surprise there! We ordered the Croissant w/ Ham & Cheese and the Sandwich Matin. Between these two, I'd go with the latter- although both were very good. The runny egg, avocado slices, cut with the salty prosciutto on the Matin is hard to beat if you're craving umami. I also really like where the cafe is situated. Albeit nothing special, if you sit outside, you get a nice, calming view of the alley with the slight rustle of the city behind you. Add a cup of hot joe and some good food and you get the perfect start to your ideal morning."

This is a classic little French cafe with NY flare. Meaning, don't take so long after you're done with your food/drink lol.

Really. I stated that I can't and don't eat pork, and they 'guaranteed' and insisted that there was no pork on the salmon brioche. This wasn't the case, obviously. That was it, folks.  This really showed that La Parisienne didn't take this situation seriously and totally dismissed it. It was poorly handled. Period.There was no manager that stepped in, as both servers were quick to try to 'justify' the 'Pork-gate.' Super disappointed in how this eatery handled it - was offering a genuine apology really that hard?And, they had the audacity to ask if we were interested in ordering desserts - like, I don't trust you all!Please do better, La Parisienne.

They do require a ""deposit fee"" of $10 to play pool- make sure you return the white ball in order to get your deposit back. Then the cost to play is #2. I've heard that the drinks here were at one time, one of the cheapest in the neighborhood but they have had to discontinue some of the deals due to rent increases. Sad day. Most times that I have visited have been late on a weekday or on a Sunday, but each time there is just enough of a crowd. The bartender has always been good in my experience. Providing laughs as well as drinks and leaving us well attended. Be aware that it is cash only. That's the main downside to this spot. It really grinds my gears when I can't use a card. I never carry cash. Overall, this spot is nice on occasion, but for me it's not a go-to. 3.4/5"
1252,NFE2bRE4gF8Ev70X-mV-QA,6/10/2019,4 star rating,"I have been to this bar a few times during my visits to New York City.  I find this bar to be great for having a good time and meeting new people.I describe the interior of this place as a typical dive bar.  There are some fun games for patrons to play.  Games include pinball, video games, and darts.  Also, this is a cozy bar that accommodates mostly drinking and socializing.  This certainly is not a bad thing for people who come in here with a group of people.  The interior looks vintage and has not been revamped in a long time.  This also is not a bad thing because in this case, this is maintaining the original building design.The employees appear to have a decent eye on cleanliness and order.  For the most part, the employees do well on keeping up on their organizing and cleaning duties.  The reason I docked one star is because sometime, I have walked in here, and a few areas had obviously been neglected for a while.  These particular areas are not severe, but this would be a noteworthy detail of improving to enhance the inside.  Besides this minor detail, I have always felt comfortable walking in here, hanging out with friends, and socializing with new people.The employees are always friendly and helpful.  Some of them have been great at carrying a good conversation with their patrons.  Most of the time, the topic is about what is happening in the gay Manhattan scene.  Some of them have also been interested in hearing my Minnesota stories.  Also, they seem to care about their customers and want them to come back.  This aspect shows with how they interact with us, whether it is while we are placing an order, them making the order, or us enjoying our drinks.When I have entered here, I have usually been consistent with either a vodka cranberry or a sour apple.  Regardless of what I order, I comes to me tasting delicious.  The alcohol content is not too weak or too strong.  It is at a comfortable level.  Even during the business's busy times, the orders have consistently been delivered to me in a reasonable amount of time.  The other reason why I docked a star from this business is because they only take cash, not card for the payment.  For me, this has been an inconvenience because I do not always feel comfortable walking around with too much cash in my wallet.  Also, I do not use cash often when ordering, except for tipping.  Accepting card payments would improve the ordering process.When I am in the Manhattan area and looking for a good dive bar, I will continue keeping this place in mind.  I feel like I can count on them for overall quality customer service satisfaction and a good time."

Bartender was drunk and unprofessional. And don't even bother going if you identify as straight they will literally treat you like the plaque.

This place used to be the centerpiece for many of my late night adventures . . . I remember when the reverse happy hour drinks were only three bucks (man, I am old).You can come here alone or with a gang of folks and always meet new people.  Although the drinks are really cheap, you definitely will get what you pay for because I believe the liquor is five shelves below bottom shelf, in terms of quality. Speaking of paying, this bar is cash only and there is a Bank of America right across the street. If you a going to drink beer try to stick to the basic bottled beers (e.g. budwiser) because you may be a little disappointed. The bar environment is pretty relaxed - not too much of a scene, especially during the week. This place is a perfect place to meet up with friends (or your Tinder/Grindr date) for a few drinks an see where the night (or morning) takes you. Most of the bartenders are pretty cool and laid back. The older gentleman (I think he is English), who works the earlier shifts, is quite funny and very nice."

Then I Asked Her To Replace The Top of The Drink Because It Was DIRTY!!!Being In That Location I Can Tell They Have Leadership Issues. It Is Run By A Bunch of Kids Who Do Not Care About Customer Service.

Only problem I have with this McDonald is the wait time and the customer service, sometimes you can get your food in a few minutes, sometimes you'll be waiting for half and hour. The staff seems to dislike when customers consult them about any issues.One time I had seen that the French fries that I order was barely half full, so I requested them to add a little bit more fries for me, the worker told me that it was ""filled"". When I insisted, she looked her manager and told her that I wanted more fries, who then rolled her eyes at me and ignored me. After about a minute or two of ignoring me, the manager came over and barely filled it to the point that it's barely sticking out of the fries cup."

Israeli cheesecake dessert (special of the day) was unique, more like a tart pudding with savory crunch toping than the usual sweet slice format. Great dining choice in Chelsea!"

A week later, I still find myself dazing out at my desk, lost in the memory of my Roasted Chicken. It was simultaneously crispy and juicy. The crisp was honestly incredible. The ""mouthfeel""--to the extent that I can use that term with a straight face--was impeccable. And the dish kept it simple. It wasn't afraid to just taste like chicken. For dessert, the semolina cake (topped with olive oil custard and gooseberries) was also stellar. It was fun, balanced, and not overly sweet. The drinks were excellent. My wife and I enjoyed the Kalamboli, the Radiant Tramp, and an undisclosed number of off-menu drinks, based on our requests to our server. The bartender was truly elite. We dined outside, which was sufficiently warm and enclosed to keep the cold and rest of the city out."

They reserved some tables for us up front, but also let our guests sit where they liked, including outside and in the back room.Overall, the staff and the space itself created exactly the experience we were looking for and we are so glad to have made Worthwild a part of our special day.

Apparently the serving varies based on weight, which I understand. And also I know that octopus is a delicacy. I guess I just wanted something else to go on the plate with it? There was a small serving of greens, but it wasn't enough to feel satisfied by just that entree alone. I had also ordered the potato gratin, though, which was a generous portion to make up for it.But yeah, aside from that: the octopus, the potato gratin, & the coconut mochi cake were all SO good. I also had a drink, I forget the specific name of the cocktail but it was rum/pineapple/lime. Strong and satisfying.I'm definitely curious to check out their brunch, but definitely going to schedule a reservation as it got pretty busy. Thanks for a worthwhile visit, Worthwild!"

I was on speaker phone when i heard how this guy was talking to my boyfriend and his coworker. Numerous times my boyfriend told him that it was okay and that he hopes he has a merry Christmas in a polite manner and this guy caught an attitude.  If burger king isn't treating you right don't take it out on the customers take it up with your manager!"

Now, I give fair reviews, which is why I mention the history of this place and why I have never given a bad review before. The first sign that things were amiss was when I began getting a couple orders that tasted a little off, and then there were the ones that were bad enough that I didn't eat at all.

So at the end of 2019 when they closed for a short time because it had dropped down to a B rating, that only reinforced that something actually was off. If you don't know how ratings work in NYC, a B is pretty bad (just go google it). But apparently they ""fixed the issues"" and they reopened again. Naturally, I came back. A few bad orders (and a B rating) isn't enough for me to lose faith, right?Then, BAM, coronavirus hits and they were shut down for a couple months. When they reopened I was ELATED to order! But, for some reason the food was OFF again and I actually found hair in it couple of times. I stopped ordering. Eventually my partner talks me into ordering again (because ""history,"" and hair can occasionally fall into food), but I do so only after we call the restaurant directly to ask if there's a new chef.

This time we decided what the heck let's try a crepe too since that's what the name of the shop is. So we got 2 green mango smoothies one without pineapple. The mint was so refreshing.

I was thrilled because I don't come across gluten-free AND vegan crepes often in NYC.My first visit here I got a peanut butter & banana sweet crepe, and the second time, I got a custom savory crepe with grilled mushroom, caramelized onion, and chickpeas. The latter probably sounds a little strange, and I even wondered aloud after I ordered it if it was weird, but the guy who took my order assured me that it would be good (and NOT weird) because they mix together the filling with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper. And it turns out, it was delicious and very satisfying. It even came with a small side salad, too.I do have to say that the gluten-free crepe batter doesn't hold together all that well, so it kind of fell apart as I was eating them (both the sweet and the savory), but I didn't care. Just don't expect the crepe to stay neat as you eat it. They tasted so good. I just wish there was a tofu option for the crepe fillings as I would have loved to be able to add protein to my crepe (both sweet and savory). Also would have been nice to have an option for a vegan cheese to help hold the savory filling together and add another dimension to the flavor profile.The place is small - just a small counter at the window with a few stools to sit at. Outside is a bench that you could sit on when the weather is warmer.They also have a lot of juices and smoothies, but I'm not really a juice or smoothie person on a regular basis. So it may be a while before I get around to trying one of those, but I'll definitely be back to have more crepes!"

That day started the addiction!It was the Green Mango smoothie for me. I love green smoothies or just enjoy adding kale/ spinach to my smoothies. And this smoothie tastes so delicious, the honey and the mint make the perfect combo! And I always add a little protein because gains right?I've also tried their Protein Power smoothie. I was very nervous about this because I don't like banana in my smoothies as it is super powerful. But this smoothie was soooooo good. I also love that you can switch out ingredients if that's not what you want. Even though I can make my own smoothies at home, they can guarantee I'll be a customer for life."

This location used to be a hot pot place until they closed and this Vietnamese place took it over during the pandemic. Being fairly new, this spot is clean and modern looking. It is very spacious too and perfect for a group gathering. In terms of the food, we were more than satisfied.We ordered several plates of pork with rice vermicelli (bun thit nuong). This was a big hit for all of us and what I would recommend the most. The meat was extremely juicy and seasoned perfectly. He had one bowl of pho as well. The broth tasted fine and did not seem bland as some others are saying. The only thing that was disappointing for us were their spring rolls.

But that's fine.. outdoor dining is starting to be less of a thing. I ordered the #1 large phô that had the rare beef, tendon, tripe, and brisket. The portion was adequate but the broth was not hot enough in my opinion. It was maybe a step or two above warm and this  was during busy Saturday night dinner time. As a result, my rare beef actually barely got any more cooked. My friend got the #2 which is the same but smaller bowl and her broth was also not hot. The beef was also a bit fatty, but it wasn't bad. The noodles were good and did not have an overcooked consistency, probably because the broth was not hot.  That said, it wasn't a great experience.  For both of us, they gave us a small plate of bean sprouts and just two small branches of leaves. I've never seen a phô place give so little for two persons!  They also did not have any jalapenos but I notice some other places don't have them either. Overall it was serviceable. I also had the crispy pork rolls as an appetizer... 4 rolls and they only gave us 3 leaves............. We had to split one of the leaves.This is only the second time I've been here, but unfortunately it wasn't a great experience. The food was adequate but the service was not great. We literally got one cup of water and one napkin with the meal and no one ever checked up on us.Hope they improve."

A few hours later, however, all that food was hurled towards the exits in an hour long bathroom episode.

The food was horrible and disgusting. We got the big bowl pho which was horrible the broth was just warm it didn't even cook the fresh rib eye like it usually does. The brisket was chewy, which felt like they just reheated the meat from yesterday. We also got a flan from them and the top was gray it looked disgusting. It makes me so sad to write this because this was one of my favorite restaurants to go to in the neighborhood during rainy days and cold winters.

The ambiance is typical dive bar, complete with the very sticky seats and tables. The bathroom leaves a lot to be desired as well. It's not my vibe but if you're looking for divey bar feel with overpriced watered down drinks, staff who are hostile and unhelpful, and a younger clientele, this is the place for you. Unfortunately, I will not be coming back."

1395,1ckkPS7KtGSu_xXXWKcbvQ,10/11/2021,1 star rating,I've been coming to this place for over a year since I came back to NY. I used to come with some of my friends that used to work out here with (white) after work and never had a problem. They grab the togo drinks and not tip everytime because they were clearly getting off work and not always able to. No one ever said anything to them. When I come and sit and drink and start a tab I also always tip. The last time being a few days ago. When I come and sit with my other friend group (predominantly black) we were asked to stand because we had someone smoking and vaping. Ok no problem.Even though we've seen other people smoking/vaping in the seats and they haven't been asked to stand up or move to smoke as servers walk past them .The past few times  we've come the tab has been covered by someone else so they haven't consistently been tipping (even though we've been coming during happy hour and paying the full price bc someone told me the other day they weren't doing happy hour currently) the same two drinks $22 and we get them to go and leave. The servers are super rude and I tried to explain that I wasn't the one covering the tab and legit kept arguing with me and saying comments towards me. Even started talking about me at the bottom of the steps near the door about me when I walked up and I asked the server helping me today about it and she confirmed that she was making comments about me being cheap and never tipping. Any time i've come with my original friend group and we stood around with drinks togo and done the same thing after work no one ever looked at us funny or anything no one ever said anything. I come with my predominately black friend group and they're really standing around talking about me and looking directly at me while she's talking about me when we walk up. That's mad embarrassing like they're trying to justify the fact that she was talking about me and is gonna ask me if i'm going to tip. Like you're trying to bully me into tipping after me not tipping for a few days. Besides that only the short guy and the one dark haired girl who dresses cute are the only two people who are ever nice towards us in the first place. Like y'all are mad rude we just come bc it's on the way home and it's a togo drink.

HOWEVER, after being ""served"" by two of the surliest women who call themselves bartenders, I highly doubt there is any form of management at this place. A true shame, as I used to go here frequently when the drinks and DJ's were fantastic, and the staff was actually friendly. Not only did the indifferent blonde in a giant onesie fail to make eye contact or even try to convey any semblance of a welcome, she served up a ginger concoction that would be better put to use as toilet cleanser. It was so astringent I felt my pH changing after one sip. The brunette was no better, and there they were, leaning against the bar and talking to one another with their nonchalant monotones, while my friend and I tried in vain to figure out how it was possible to make such undrinkable cocktails. I've been to more uplifting funerals. Bye, bye, Botanica! You are off the hit list."

Happy hour sees a few discounted drink options, and the beer+shot combos are decent: $6 for a 'Gansett and whiskey will kickstart any evening's revelry. When I sidled in shortly after 5 PM, the place was empty. By the time I left at 7, it was packed, raucous and loud. Most of the other patrons seemed to be in their late 20s, young professionals, enjoying their lives. It's a good scene to be a part of."

It looks like a dump and I couldn't find the rating posted anywhere, but I said what the hell. I ordered the spare rib tips with pork fried rice, with a egg. She charged me a extra 25 cents, which wasn't bad because most other places charge 50cents. I suggest you get 2 eggs because one wasn't enough. The rib tips were pretty good, the meat was tender. The fried rice was good and flavorful. The hubby ordered a half chicken with pork fried rice and the chicken was seasoned well. They lose a star because I specifically stated that I wanted my eggroll fried hard and it wasn't. I ordered it last minute so I'm assuming she took out too early."

I didn't have cash for tips only like a billion quarters and he was so nice about it. I felt so badThe food however was all wrong. I ordered shrimp and broccoli and made sure to call and say that i wanted fried rice instead of white. They made sure to charge my card more for the substitution but still brought me white rice. then they only had 3 shrimp in there. That pissed me off a bit. What made me even more upset is that when I tasted my roomy's fried rice it was really good so I freaking missed out. Anyways I might give them a chance again but it would take a lot of desperation.

I had just ordered food from here, have ordered a few times and usually have pretty good service however today I was treated very poorly. I ordered through GrubHub and got the typical call saying they were arriving and I said no worries I'll buzz you in. 5 minutes go by and still no food. At that time I received another call however was greeted by someone yelling into my ear incoherently. I hear my buzzer (finally) and again answered by the delivery man yelling into my buzzer. When he came to my door he then proceeded to yell at me about having to leave his car and threw my food at me. I have, for other delivery services, met them at the building front door but after our first conversation anticipated him coming up. I had already paid 20% for his tip and did not appreciate getting treated so poorly. Terrible service today."

This place offers a free parking garage but be mindful that it is very cramped in there. They have lots of regular billiards tables, snooker tables, and even poker tables. Very interesting place with food and drinks!The only downside is that things are so disgusting in here like the bathroom and sometimes the tables. My co-workers and I booked 4 tables and all were quite dirty. Looks like nobody wiped them down for a while and the felt on the table wasn't ""brushed""."

A good place for late night billiards. Friendly/competitive environment. There are a lot of tables for both pool and ping pong so its good place for large groups. The pools sticks are pretty beat up so if you have a pool stick lying around at home, bring it in. Same goes for the ping ping paddles."

The music selection is very diverse. The only con I can think of is that parking in the area sucks. They have a parking lot but it's almost always filled.

I've made some new friends here and everyone is super friendly.They also have a nice table tennis area in the side room.It's basically a no-nonsense, quality pool hall. Hopefully I'm getting better!"

1421,RH6kTt81G4OdWP603LnoDQ,6/24/2017,4 star rating,"OK, so this place has made some improvements in the past several months. I don't know if they have switched management or just got their act together, but I have found myself going here at least once a week. It's pretty much the only bagel and coffee place in the immediate area, so it's a go-to for the time being. I still don't order bagels with cream cheese here, but my boyfriend does and says that they have gotten better about not slathering it with excessive cream cheese when you ask them not to. My favorite thing to get is a pumpernickel bagel with lox. The bagels are always fresh, and the lox is just as fresh and high-quality as similar places in Midtown and the UES. The upside is that while places in those neighborhood charge upwards of $13.00 for a lox bagel, Bagel Tree prices theirs at a very reasonable $7.00.The only thing I'll dock points for is that their coffee is very overpriced. A medium iced latte is about $5.00, and the coffee sometimes tastes stale. They should either drop those prices or improve the product. ---------------Right around the corner and I still won't go back. When I say ""light cream cheese"" I don't mean ""glob it on until it reaches critical mass"". So much spread on my bagel that it squirted all over my handbag and my clothes. Disgusting! I had to throw it in the garbage. Same goes for my boyfriend's order. He requested light butter and when he pulled out his bagel, it was dripping in buttery slop. No thanks!"
1422,RH6kTt81G4OdWP603LnoDQ,9/29/2017,4 star rating,"Best place in the neighborhood! Friendly service, fresh food, and reasonable prices. But I do wish they were on seamless or had some kind of online ordering service for us socially awkward people who don't feel like making delivery requests over the phone. Also, their breakfast menu stops at noon, which is obviously acceptable, but the BLT is part of that menu. I personally don't know anyone who eats a BLT for breakfast. I understand the grill has to be cleaned at some point during the day, but it just feels weird only being able to get a sandwich thats usually eaten at lunch, only during breakfast hours."
1423,RH6kTt81G4OdWP603LnoDQ,10/26/2020,1 star rating,I ordered two bagels from door dash. When I received my order I was meet with disappointment as BOTH items were incorrect. As I use things such as seamless and door dash often I called the restaurant directly. I was meet with even more rudeness where the girl who answered said it wasn't there fault both orders were wrong and that it was what was printed on the receipt. When I went to explain that the options were available and that it wasn't my fault she proceeded to put me on hold. Little did she realize I was not on hold and heard her continuing to take orders. I waited on hold for ten minutes to no one getting back on the line with me. The food was mediocre and the customer service was beyond terrible and unreasonable. If you're ok with your order being messed up and the restaurant taking no responsibility this is the place for you.
1424,RH6kTt81G4OdWP603LnoDQ,6/19/2019,1 star rating,They have a $10 minimum to use your card (in 2019) and will try to make you buy food and products you don't want to fulfill that minimum. Buyers beware.

There's a gentleman standing outside also on this cold morning. So I call an a Latina lady answer the phone. I'm looking at her though the door. I then I asked her what time they open and she say 6 am. So I told her I'm at the door and it's now 5 after. She then opened the door and told me I have to wait because they has to fix things up. I said maybe you need to put 6:30 on the sign. This has happened every morning I been there. Bagel Tree needs to understand that people are on they way to work and need to get in and out. Would've gotten 4*'s but the late opening and the young lady attitude pushed me to find another place to go.

It can get packed pretty quickly on lunch times, so you better be there 10 minutes before 12. Sad part is there a minimum on cards , you must purchase 10.00 or more of stuff in Bagel tree. I haven't been there for a long time, it's a bit pricey for everyday lunch for me. If you have the money spend it. Ps. There bagels are awesome !!

For breakfast I ordered an everything bagel, scooped out with egg and sausage. Nothing complicated.  Took a while to make but ok, $3.50 +tax.  The bagel itself is pretty good, fluffy and easy to pull apart.  I like my everything bagels heavily seasoned so I think it could use more on the top.  Sausage circle on top of two scrambled eggs, it reminds me of living down in midtown.  For now I give it an ok. The prices on the bottled beverages is kinda high for the area, im not sure how this place is going to hold up over time but we shall see. Their take away menu has a slew of spelling errors which I find entertaining but non-professional at the same time."

Your bagels are often times just the way I like them, a little crunch on the outside but soft on the inside. You are clean, well-kept, and well stocked with many goodies that some might say detract from the beauty of a good bagel. Nevertheless, those hardly distract me. The guys behind the counter know how to hook up my regular order, but for whatever reason that lady at the cash register is always too stressed and slightly rude.

Pho Bang is a decent, efficiently-run, no-frills pho spot that has been around for decades & that speaks volumes about this place. Don't forget: ca$h only. Although the broth is not much to write home about, Pho Bang food has been consistent and value for the $. One bowl of pho is pretty big for me, so I tend to get one to share with a friend.  I've tried the banh mi and it was meh/bland, but the hoisin and sriracha sauces on the table made it better. It would be nice if they had more banh mi choices. The Summer Roll is pretty good, so definitely get that. All in all, can't really go wrong with most of the items on the menu."

So I handed over a $20 for the bill of $14.95. Told them keep the change as I handed them my $20 bill. Which mean a $5 tip, but no ""thank you"" no word whatsoever. Absolutely no mannerism. Guess a $5 tip on a $15 order isn't worthy of a thank you. Or maybe they're only nice to their own kind?"

Not sure why they couldn't be a 24-hr place, because it would've helped at times. You can still count on them for a cheap, hearty, homey meal, with nonchalant service every time.Their pho broth is simple, but has nice depth of flavors and is always piping hot. #1 Xe Lua or #2 Dac Biet is the way to go. Thinly sliced brisket, flank, eye of round, etc. cook within seconds in the hot beef broth. All the condiments on the side are game for consumption, including bean sprouts, basil leaves, and Sriracha plus hoisin for the meats.Depending on my mood, their many rice dishes are also excellent choices. Grilled Porkchop with pineapple over rice is one of my all-time favorite Viet dishes. Springs rolls are always hot and crispy. However, their banh mi sandwich was extremely disgusting the one time I got it, slimy pate and very fatty meats. Skip the banh mi, but stay for everything else!"

This neighborhood once again has a stinker of a restaurant that I now know never to try again."

I have been a loyal customer to another local Mexican Restaurant in my neighborhood, but Mandato is top notch as well. I ordered 3 barbacoa tacos (delicious), a guanabana shake (delicious) & quesadillas (beyond delicious) Delivery was pretty quick & the food arrived warm. They are giving my former favorite Mexican Restaurant, a run for their money. Keep up the good work amigos!"

Now there is a lot of mexican place around the same bloc and all of them have higher reviews (by the hundreds). But we went there because they were playing mexican music and it looks authentic. We have tacos and rice and beans. The black beans there is HANDS DOWN on of the best I have had. It was just spot on and creamy how it suppose to be. My husband tried their special tacos mandato which was a good choice the only thing is that the meat could have been a little bit more tender. The service was very friendly and we love everything about this little place. I would definitely recommend!

The beef patty was pretty good I mean it's hard to mess up sneed patty. The pizza on the other hand was COLD AND HARD and it's such a disappointment because that's my favorite pizza. YOU CAN EVEN SEE IN THE PICTURE HOW COLD THE SLICE WAS. It's bad enough that it was hard but it was so cold it made it taste even worse. I forced myself however to eat it because I paid damn near $5 for it but I just couldn't. I threw the rest away. Attached is a picture of the pizza after I forced myself to consume it.

Everything is fairly priced, the pepperoni pie I ordered was $18. With free, delivery, you can't beat it. Their pizza is tasty and not too thick or heavy. They have a nice doughy crust that is perfect for dipping in the marinara left over from your garlic knots or mozz sticks."

Honestly I almost didn't want to write a review on them... for the simple fact that I don't want everyone to know how good they are!! But then I thought, the world needs to know how amazing these treats are! I had the tres leches cake. It was perfect! Just the right amount of moistness. The icing was amazing! They even package it in a way that helps the cake retain all its juices. So full of flavor and definitely my favorite to recommend. I had a personal serving but they seem to offer it in a big cake size option also. The girl working there was very sweet and helpful! I will definitely be going back!"

I was planning to order a tres leches cake one day ahead but the lady told me it needed to be two days prior, so I ended up getting the smaller version and a red velvet cupcake to try.  The tres leches cake was very good - moist and not too sweet. I loved how the whip cream was not sweet to balance out the sweetness from the condensed milk. The red velvet was pretty good as well - very nutty, the cream cheese frosting was on point and the cake itself was very soft. I came back the following day hoping to get half a dozen of the miniature tres leches cake for a birthday celebration but sadly there was ONLY ONE LEFT! So I ended up getting the last one and 3 different kinds of cupcakes: chocolate salted caramel, pumpkin spice and chocolate blackout. They were all very good, not overly sweet and soft. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the chocolate blackout cupcake waaay more than I thought I would - a mouthful of chocolate without being too sweet! The crumbs on the frosting with the cake just all goes so well together!I definitely want to come back to try other sweete that they have and make sure to order ahead of time!"

I was worried about it being too sweet since my family doesn't like sweet stuff but omg, this turned out to be the best cake ever. Not gonna lie, the $58 shocked me and I almost thought they made a mistake but I could see why later on. It's worth it!!! The cake was surprisingly really heavy and TALL. It kinda reminded me of an Indian milk sweet. Extremely rich yet at the same time, it wasn't overwhelming at all! My family who doesn't like sweet stuff really really liked it. Also said it was one of the best cakes they had. Didn't last long in my home. Everyone finished that quickly. Ugh now I'm craving for it."

I will make the trip into queens just for this alone. The carrot cake cupcake- The frosting was light and fluffy not sandy or overly cream cheese heavy like usual bakery's make. The carrot cake part was fresh and had just the right amount of raisins and nuts. The banana bread -A huge chunk and dense and Fresh if you are a banana bread fan it's worth a tryThe funfetti cupcakeAgain frosting was amazing and I am the person who usually eats the frosting and throws the cake away. If I say a frosting is amazing it is lol.

I picked out a cinnamon sugar muffin for me. I'm a sucker for anything cinnamon sugar and this exceeded my expectations. It was dense and moist and perfect. My son picked out a vanilla cupcake with pink vanilla frosting which looked great. For my husband I picked up a small tres leches cake. Now I'm not typically a tres leches fan, I don't like the wet cake. However, this was unbelievable!! I had one taste...then two...then split the cake with him.  So, so amazing.  I also had an iced coffee and added some home made pumpkin spice simple syrup which was the perfect amount of sweetness.  Everything in their showcase looked so yummy that I'm going to make sure I make my way to Ridgewood more often."

I got their beef tartare, cold noodles, and small beef combo on the second visit and it was plenty of food for 2 people. My favorite cut here is their prime ribeye which the server cooked to perfection with a good ratio of fat/meat. I enjoyed the cold noodles w/ meat. They also have a good selection of banchan and their kimchi stew is delicious. It's a lively spot to go with a group, but expect to wait during the weekend. One downside is that the only way to access the restaurant is through one elevator."

We dropped our name on the list and wandered around KTown until we received a surprise text after about 30 minutes!After being seated, we ordered and experienced a loud and festive atmosphere. While it was a bit loud for my taste, it didn't overshadow the amazing food, incredible service, and wonderful overall experience.Highly recommend and will definitely visit again!"

I was very surprised when I arrived and it was super busy, clearly a popular place. Wait was about 45-50minutes for a Saturday night. Be sure to be on time for the reservation because it's only a 5 minute grace period. I missed my reservation by 3 minutes (I waited on the long line a bit before I skipped to the front) but they still accepted us which was nice of them.We got Seafood Tofu Soup (spicy) but it was so good and shareable for two. For dinner we got marinated chicken and shrimp (I don't eat red meat but if you are a meat lover they have several options). Each dish came with about 4 sides. Our waiter also cooked the food for us which was nice. For drinks I got Asian hard seltzer which was good & my boyfriend got a ginger ale.Overall I would def come back! And would recommend. Such a gem in k-town."

Bouncer is firm no BS kind of a guy, but keeps the people inside happy and safe. Plenty of TV screens on all the walls for watching sports. I actually had a good time despite them running out of my husbands two favorite drink choices Jack Daniels and Guinness, so he had to substitute. Our waitress not really waitressing, we had to wait forever for her to bring drinks and than it took 5 min to get her attention to order another. I will definitely return but next time I am sitting at the bar, not a table. Update: owner reached out to me and apologized for running out of hubbys drink choices, and I honestly had no idea how it works in NYC ordering process. He seemed very concerned, which shows that he cares about his customers satisfaction and his reputation."

No gloves (covid free I hope) My son arrives we order his coke... host goes back to door way hanging out with a buddy. I then gesture with my hand asking verbally as well so he can take our order... disappears inside. 5/6 minutes later come with my check... I say ""why did you close me out"" he says ""you signaled to bring you the check""  I then say ""NO, I ask for you to TAKE OUR ORDER"" but obviously, (go back to #1) With his music on 10 how could he hear me.  Gets an attitude, now I am afraid to order food (because you never know) I say ""just close it out"" ... he then becomes ""street"" on me with ""this ni**a"" (not in a racial manner but I can be hood too and that alone was far from hospitable. I removed myself along with my son and told him to keep the change. With so many bars in Hamilton Heights this is one less I would visit.

1519,xWqvccWuks8uBPewRbQArw,3/7/2020,4 star rating,"Interesting experience. This is an organic farm to table restaurant so you will find it a little pricey. Most portions are small so bear in mind you will probably be ordering 2 or 3 dishes.  It's owned and run by a husband and wife team and the husband is a very creative chef. He changes things up and is not what you expect for a restaurant with the appearance of an old fashion luncheonette.You are not coming here for the decor, it's a small restaurant. One of the reviews I read said there was no bathroom, not true lol. You need to ask and it's through the kitchen.PROS: Great flavors, quality food, healthy meals, organic and Vegan friendly. You can definitely taste the freshness. Found the customers to be very pleasant and wound up speaking with both tables either side of me for most of the meal. Actually friended one who is a fellow Yelper. Good service from the waiter. It's BYOB with a reasonably priced liquor store next door.CONS: The first waiter was nice although it was his first day on the job. Luckily the main waitress took over. As stated portions tend to be small. I felt most items were a little pricey although you are paying for quality and creativity. As an appetizer we had an appetizer of beets, carrots and gnocchi which was small but flavorful. Main course was salmon which was baked with Saffron and Cauliflower.  We ordered a side dish which was Swiss chard, Pune nuts Au gratin. The veggie burger was Awesome and came with fries.  For desert had the Apple pie with cheddar ice cream which was also great. They have a nice selection of coffee, teas and use beets as a theme with most of the dishes they offer. They have beet ice cream and beet lattes. Overall nice experience, I would come back although I will try to come back less hungry."

1525,xWqvccWuks8uBPewRbQArw,9/14/2019,5 star rating,"Beets and Carrots is a secret Bay Ridge gem that people secretly whisper about. This is probably for the better, as my friend and I came on a Friday night and we were the only ones in the restaurant. I don't want to have to start fighting off hipsters or enduring an hour wait for dinner. As others have said, the restaurant is nothing to really look at. Though, it does feel like you're having dinner in someone's home using their family's fine china. The service mimics this too- the waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable. Beets and Carrot Hummus [$12]: The beets and carrots hummus was such a delightful appetizer. I'm usually turned off by hummus [see: Sabra hummus in the supermarket], but I love it here. Roasted chickpeas on top add a wonderful bit of crunch. Warm salty pita bread is served on the side. This is such a light dish, the flavors of the hummus were so refreshing, not acidic or overwhelming [see: Sabra hummus in the supermarket]. It's also the perfect size for sharing among two people, though I don't doubt my ability to eat it all by myself.Black Russian Bread [$3]: There's no actual bread service at Beets and Carrots but I did find black Russian bread on the menu. This brings me back to my days living in Sheepshead Bay/Brighton Beach. Black Russian bread, for comparison, tastes like pumpernickel bread. There were two thick pieces, salted and buttered. On the side was more butter and some orange marmalade. Outrageously delicious. Veal Cheeks [$29]: These veal cheeks man. These veal cheeks were fork tender. I did not even use my knife once. Incredible. The veal cheeks are braised in red wine and served with roasted vegetables. The vegetables were perfectly roasted and were delicious on its own. Overall, this dish may have been just a little bit too salty but it's still a winner. Mixed Berry Pavlova Cake [$8.50]: I think desserts may be the achilles heel of Beets and Carrots. I enjoyed the mixed berry pavlova cake but it just didn't wow me. The meringue was nice and the cherries underneath the cake were big and juicy. My friend had the beets and carrot cake with the beets and carrots ice cream [$8.50]. The cake was super moist but the ice cream tasted too much like beets but it also didn't really taste much of anything at all. Beets and Carrots is BYOB. There's a $10 cork fee which I think is fair, especially if you buy a $15-20 bottle of wine. Most bottles of wine cost minimum of $50-$60 depending where you go. The bill came out to $100 for two people after tax, before tip. Definitely not a bad deal considering the quality of food! Bay Ridge is definitely better off for having this restaurant around. And I am lucky that it is so close to where I live. Huzzah."

So I love the idea of having this bakery in the area, as a counter to all the chains.Unfortunately, however, it's just not very good. I've tried croissants, cookies, and cakes from this place on various occasions, and they have all tasted dry. If they were made on the same day that I bought them, it would be a surprise to me.The baked goods aren't fresh, and seem like they've been left on display for just a tad too long. As much as I want to support the local bakery, I'd steer clear of this place unless you're already in the area and don't mind mediocre baked goods."

1588,jVYyth-tq-o9o6T54oAWOA,1/14/2019,5 star rating,"Bakhtar on Main street is a place where you can get some delicious mouth watering kebabs for a bargain. The place may not look much from outside or inside, but the food here is amazing! When I first walked in I asked if this was operated by the same owner as the one located in Fresh Meadows. I was told emphatically NO! The process for ordering is simple. After placing your order find a seat and they will bring the food to your table when it's ready. The fridge is well stocked with beverages and you serve yourself. Once your meal is done you reconcile the bill at the cashier and tell them what you had to drink, sort of an honor system when it comes to the drinks, but they know the entrees you ordered. Our entrees were lamb, chicken and beef tikka. We also had the chicken kofta. Wow! The kebabs were juicy and delicious. The rice was fragrant and the texture was perfect. The tikka kebabs had a light char and the kofta was seasoned well as the coriander, turmeric and cumin came through in the kebabs. Alas, did I forget to mention the Awesome white and green sauce! I love that the sauce is dispensed in large squeeze bottles, you my friend have the power to squeeze away!The staff here were very friendly and since it was our 1st time here gave us a rice pudding (Phirni) and green tea on the house. My expression has always been ""If it's free, it's for me!""  I love the cardamom in the pudding and in the green tea as it wakes up and elevates the flavor of the food.TIP - There are pitchers of water in the fridge with 4 ounce plastic cups. The water is free so you can elect not to buy any drinks. Oh yeah, CASH only and they also have an ATM machine inside .I really enjoyed my meal here and excited to know they have party trays available to order. The parking situation outside is pretty good so finding a free and metered spot should be a breeze.Great place and looking forward to return with friends and family since the menu has many more items I would love to try. Until we meet again, Cheers!"

Anyway, I was greeted by professional staff and I selected lamb tikka over rice with bottled water as a beverage. The wait time was moderate and I noticed that my meal was situated in a sealed carton which was appreciated because it would not have become cold. I noticed that the lamb tikka was lean, but peppery and the rice tasted fresh. The included bread had absorbed some of the lamb tikka flavoring so I couldn't assess how it would have tasted alone, but I wasn't disappointed. I also noticed that the sauces for each meal were included as full containers which was why I provided a 5-star review since I could have easily regulated the quantity of each sauce with my meal. This was useful when I had finally tried the side-salad."

Sometimes the chicken comes out undercooked so I usually tell them to get it well done. Food wise this is 4 sService wise, it's 0  Their servers are very unprofessional and lazy, they don't even have the courtesy to seat you and bring you menus. We recently went and the two servers were just sitting at the tables doing nothing, after I tried calling them to take our order, they sat around for another 10 mins before actually coming over, very inefficient! I hope the owner sees the reviews and improves the service, only then this would be a 5 star restaurant."

Waited 2 hours outside the restaurant and drove 1.5 hours back home only to find out they made the wrong food and the owner isn't even willing to take responsibility. Save yourself the time & trouble. Don't ever go here and don't ever get catering from here. The food isn't even good"

I believe its $8 or $9.The chicken kofta and the chicken tandoori is really good too, although I prefer kofta over tandoori since I think pure chicken meat is too dry (anywhere, not just here). I love the firni ( I might've spelled it wrong) too!  Its sweet and just a great dessert.They always give salad 1st (lettuce, tomato, cucumber). The white sauce is heavenly ( so good that my friend wanted to take the bottle home, lol)! I also love the green chile sauce!The cheeseburger is good too although it tastes more like a kofta than an American burger. Its different but I love it just as much as its western counterpart.The service is always good. However, our table was lacking napkins and a pitcher yesterday. Although, the place was packed & I'm sure the servers just forgot to place those items on our table and we didn't want to bother them as they were already way too busy. This is my go to Afghani place so I'll be back."

The place is not the most hygenic to sit & eat right there, we always get it to go BUT who cares get the food & enjoy it at home."

There's no alcohol I repeat no alcohol! The place is filthy dirty tables and such. I got the sushi sashimi combo I asked for a spicy tuna roll instead of the California roll the waitress just nodded her head. The sushi and the sashimi was ok. The spicy tuna roll was absolutely awful all filler and it had an odor on top of it. When the check came I noticed that my meal was one dollar more than it said in the menu. I brought this to the waiters attention. He first took a dollar off my bill and said sorry then came back and added the dollar on my bill and said it was because I asked for a spicy tuna roll instead of the California roll.

There's no alcohol I repeat no alcohol! The place is filthy dirty tables and such. I got the sushi sashimi combo I asked for a spicy tuna roll instead of the California roll the waitress just nodded her head. The sushi and the sashimi was ok. The spicy tuna roll was absolutely awful all filler and it had an odor on top of it. When the check came I noticed that my meal was one dollar more than it said in the menu.

She lost train of thought when she came to our table to check on us, and got distracted by her friend at the bar a guy with a lot of tattoos, who worked at the bar, took care of the drunk waitress slack! He did his best to serve us, but my table can tell that he was a little frustrated with our table, because we was constantly axing for things to help make our food better. I had asked for a side of sour cream and something was off about the side of sour cream that came to my table, I had noticed it looks like my sour cream was spit in! After my sour cream, was spit in we noticed our table was being ignored and especially when we was trying to pay for our food. The restaurant was a OK environment, but the service was terrible and it's sad as a customer we cannot ask for things to make our food better. Without the server, feeling some type of way. my table spent a lot of money there to receive terrible service. I do not feel that the waitress deserves a $18 tip but my table still did the right thing. Just wish they could've did the same."
1638,MMg42dFFw9r7KKroTX9xKQ,1/18/2023,2 star rating,"This poor review is for the intentionally misleading menu which states ""Wednesday Burgers and Brews: Order Any Burger Get a Free Beer"" and the bartender who said she was also the Drinks Manager who was very argumentative when we asked why we were being charged for our draft beer when we ordered it with our burger. Nowhere on the menu does it state that the ""free beer"" is for only SELECT beers. No fine print, no asterisk, nothing anywhere qualifying this ""free beer"" statement. Also, nowhere on the menu does it state that they charge a 20% mandatory gratuity. We sat at the bar and I've never seen a 20% gratuity automatically added to a bill at the bar. We've come here other days and enjoyed the burgers but after this horrible customer service experience and intentionally misleading and frankly illegal menu advertising, we will NOT be back."

1641,MMg42dFFw9r7KKroTX9xKQ,12/13/2019,4 star rating,So a colleague of mine is upsets with this place so we went for our holiday lunch. It's a cold rainy day but we were met with such warmth. The waiter was very nice and attentive as we are a picky group with lots of directions for our food !The food was good over all I had the Parmesan fries and a burger so I was so in a rush to eat i didn't snap a shot but they do not shy away from the fries or the Parmesan ! I managed to snap a shot of someone Mac and cheese (edited of course  no bacon or chicken ) with a side of avocado.
1642,MMg42dFFw9r7KKroTX9xKQ,8/26/2019,2 star rating,Came here thinking we were gonna hear some music but there was none. Sat outside with some friends. Waitress was a little slow on getting to us. We ordered some food. The mozzarella sticks came out cold and we had to send those back. They brought us out a new batch. My girlfriends fries that came with her burger came out also cold. What a drag! I ordered some garlic Parmesan wings. Didn't like the presentation of them at all. They had sprinkled Parmesan cheese directly on the wings. It wasn't melted at all. And the wings were just terrible!!! I ate 2 of them and passed them to someone who wanted them. Must say tho that the Hengria ( Hennessy and sangria) was good. Had us feeling a nice buzz!! But I won't be back.

1645,MMg42dFFw9r7KKroTX9xKQ,3/6/2022,4 star rating,The drinks are good. I'm always down for a frozen drink no matter what the weather is outside. The chicken wings were really good too. Down to go back there again.
1646,MMg42dFFw9r7KKroTX9xKQ,5/4/2020,5 star rating,"I've been here a few times with friends for their famous drinks, including recently for to-go drinks. Their to-go system is quicker and more organized than most (it's much quicker if you order/pay ahead on their website) and the security is actually useful. The frozen drinks areamazing I recommend any of their frozen margaritas or the blue hawaiian- delicious and STRONG! The Adult Happy Meals are a great value for a full meal and a decently sized frozen drink for $20 (or pay $10 extra for an upgrade). The tacos are actually good, but keep in mind it's bar food so don't overshoot your expectations!"
1647,ErMFay-6o83QB2P1k4ALAg,12/8/2022,5 star rating,We were driving past this and couldn't stop looking at their Christmas decorations so we stopped in and had a late dinner. And I'm so glad we did! We only had 2 people so they sat us away from the tree at a 2 top but there's a gorgeous tree in the middle of the bar. There's booths in the back as well so it's perfect for 4 to 6 people to come here. I got the chicken pot pie and my party got the beyond burger which was done so well she said it's the best beyond burger she had in the city (we are not tourists and we eat burgers often) and my chicken pot pie warmed me up as I had almost no food in the day and I was starting to shiver at night this thing filled me up to the brim and I was warm again. I will definitely come back here for some drinks and to try their famous vegetarian lasagna.

As a bourbon fan, I couldn't decide between the Manhattan and the Old Fashioned.  Luckily they had a cool cocktail sampler!  The noise level was pretty high as the place was pretty popular.  The decor and ambiance was excellent and the wait staff was stellar.   The biscuits and gravy were top notch even by a southerners standard!  I was not expecting a gem, but this place was a find!"

1651,ErMFay-6o83QB2P1k4ALAg,12/29/2022,3 star rating,White Oak had very nice holiday decor and a nice bartender but I ordered two beers and it cost me $28 before tip. I'm no cheapskate but that seemed a bit unreasonable to me. Maybe the food is good but it's hard to stomach extra pricey drafts!
1652,ErMFay-6o83QB2P1k4ALAg,4/1/2023,2 star rating,"Beware of alcohol ""up-charges"" which are not stated on the menu.  We paid $3 and $4 extra for each martini or gimlet(5x).  The manager informed me that the $16 and $18 for drinks listed on the menu was the base price, and that they added the upcharges because martinis(very small btw)have more alcohol.  THIS WAS NO WHERE TO BE SEEN ON THE MENU AND WAS NOT MENTIONED BY THE WAITER. The manager, who was very gracious, said he would tell his wait staff to inform customers of the extra charges.  He also told me that it is an ""upscale establishment""; which is not an excuse for not properly listing his prices."
1653,ErMFay-6o83QB2P1k4ALAg,2/20/2022,5 star rating,"My friend and I went to White Oak Tavern at 2:30pm on a Sunday. It was not crowded at all, but it was raining and Superbowl Sunday, so that was probably why. Lara was our server, and she was fantastic! The interior is like a typical bar, and we were lucky to be seated near the window so it was a bit more lighted. I ordered the Country Breakfast ($20) and my friend ordered a Brunch Burger medium ($19). While I do think the breakfast is slightly overpriced, everything was delicious! ALL food on the plate was seasoned well and packed with flavor. My only con was that the bacon was not crispy, which is my preference. My friend said the brunch burger was also delicious, but beware that it is messy. The only con was the burger was closer to medium-well than to medium. My friend got a Mum's the Word mocktail ($9) that was extremely tart. Overall, I had a great experience at White Oak Tavern, and I would definitely come back if I was in the area because the food was tasty. Lara also did multiple check backs and the water got refilled. The food did take longer than normal (~20 minutes), but it was worth the wait."

But next time!We were seated outside since it was a nice breezy evening in NYC. But we took turns to goto the restroom and the indoor decor was definitely a vibe! We ordered a few items to share and loved everything-burrata (comes w bread too!)-crispy brussel sprouts (they were not lyin when they said crispy!)-fried chicken sliders (chicken was so flavorful!)-foxy sangria (HH wkdays 3-7pm)Definitely recommend checkin this spot out!"

It needs to be spiced up somehow."

L ate the rest, he usually doesn't care for fish so I didn't think he would eat the entire thing after I left it in bowl. He didn't even know which protein it was, only that it was delicious! Bread was crispy on the outside, soft inside, fish wasn't soggy even after a hr commute. Now I need to get another one and next time I won't share it! Beef stew and egg noodles were reheated for dinner the next day. I'm not a fan of egg noodles so that was just okay for me. The soup is really flavorful but a bit too salty. I separated it into two portions for myself. There's no way I can have that much sodium. The beef was lean and tender. No tendon. It was good... nothing special but great on a cold day.

My sandwich took a while to come  out, but when it did come it was lukewarm, which was a bit off-putting. My friend order soup and you didn't even see any steam coming from the bowl. The waitress never came to ask how the food was because she decided to go on break as it began to get busy (I didn't understand that).Also, they don't give you shrimp chips on the side (I guess times are hard). This isn't an elegant restaurant by any standards, but you will get filled up on the food here, in my honest opinion. It doesn't break the bank and you can go elsewhere for dessert afterwards.If you order food to go, DEFINITELY heat it up when you get home.Lastly, why are dogs being allowed in the restaurant when you clearly have a sign saying ""NO DOGS ALLOWED""?!? That's disgusting."

Place was clean and full of old Asian people so you know their bakery is very authentic to the traditional egg tart. The egg tarts were $1.25 so a little on the pricey side but so worth it. The egg was the perfect level of sweet and the crispy crust balanced it very well. YUM!

That's basically the stamp of authenticity when it comes to Chinese places. It means they're affordable, as they turn up probably 6/7 days of the week, and also good enough to frequent constantly. If you're not used to what Chinese bakeries have to offer, skip straight to their egg custard tarts. Most people think that they need to be burnt a very flaky, but if categorically speaking, that would be referred to as a ""Portuguese Egg Tart"" in Chinese. An egg custard tart should be smooth, consistent and a fair color, but not overcooked (look burnt). And for $1.25 apiece? What else could you ask for?"

There was a skirt around the bottom but it wasn't super crispy. Then we got a pink bomb and shiro bomb (three each) as well as white & red rolls and salmon stinky rolls (six each). My favorites were the shiro bombs and stinky rolls. The wasabi soy sauce is delicious. Service was very fast and they very promptly refilled waters. Would come again!

The inside was so intimate, and the staff was amazing and joking around with us. We ordered a bottle of wine between the two of us (and definitely a a few more glasses after). Food-wise, we ordered the Spicy Mc.Bomb and the Pink Bomb,  both of which were amazing and SO CUTE. The Spicy Bomb had a cripsy tempura on top, and I loved the tuna. The scallion in the Pink bomb added such a good touch to the sushi. I ordered the salmon stinky roll, and my friend ordered the tekkyu roll, which she liked. The salmon stinky roll was good, but I will say it is STINKY. Don't underestimate the garlic in the mayo - it's pretty potent. They gave us some soy sauce and some wasabi soy sauce on the side, which is good when they are mixed together. We left around 9pm, and the place was super busy by the time we left, so definitely try to get a reservation.Overall, this place was so cute and had amazing food and service.

That way, we had the whole place to ourselves (and the staff's undivided attention) for a blessed 30 min before it started filling up.- Changed our table seats to bar seats to take full advantage of the view, the decor (fun countertop + red lanterns in the front room), and the action. So much better than sitting in the dark at one of the tables.Food-wise, get the Double Cheesy Tako Risotto Balls if you are starving and need a unique, delicious app to stop you from hangry-ing. These were so worth the stomach space.Of course, the sushi bombs are...da bomb (yeah, I know, 1999 called and wants its slang back). But for serious, they are da bomb dot com. Da bomb diggity? Bada bing bada bomb? Okay, I'll stop. They're just really, really good. And not just because they're pretty and Instagrammable. They're well-made, fresh and served with the perfect amount, flavor and texture of rice. We started with the Party Bomb Special and especially loved the Mexican Bomb. How did I go so long and never think to pair raw salmon with salsa verde? I have been remiss.....REMISS, I tell you! After inhaling the Special, we were still hungry, so we added the Y. Y. J Bomb (yellowtail, yuzu + jalapeño salsa) and Hokkaido Gunkan (Hokkaido scallop, salmon roe). The Y. Y. J was definitely my second favorite of the night. The dessert pudding was also tasty.Drink-wise, get the Rambutan Martini. But advice to the bartender: Serve it with an unpeeled rambutan instead. Such a more interesting garnish. The Chili Ume Spritzer is also surprisingly delicious--and I normally avoid spritzers.I often regret trekking out to Williamsburg because so many restaurants I've tried are overhyped/overrated, but this was not one of them.

I ordered the homemade fried shrimp shumai (4 small pieces) and while fresh lacked salt and same with a sweet sauce similar to barbecue in flavor and consistency. The spicy tuna roll was more enjoyable, fresh and not spicy. I also ordered the passion fruit margarita and it was iiiiight not much passion fruit flavor. Nothing to write home about. Overall it was a satisfying experience because of the sushi roll. I can see this being a convenient and equally decent spot for neighborhood."

The dim lights across the whole restaurant makes this a great date spot. I've eaten here more than a handful of times over a couple of years and they consistently lack Kitaya Yame in stock, despite displaying it on the drink menu. I hope they restock soon.

It was dimly lit but enough to maneuver around the store. Let's talk about the food!Garlic chicken was a little bit on the salty side, but nevertheless good otherwise. The pork belly and tofu salad are definitely the highlights of the appetizer entrees. Highly recommend those two dishes. Now for the sushi bomb platter... they were prepared really well and taste wise was on par with the quality of the other food we had thus far. So far everything's pretty good. Well, how about the double cheesy risotto balls you asked? Apparently you need to ask 3 times for them to finally arrive. Perhaps a miscommunication between server and the kitchen, but we had to ask for an appetizer dish three times for it to come after we received the check. Mistakes happen but might have affected our experience on the actual dish itself when it came out. Very bland and loss of hype. Nevertheless, the other food and service were otherwise stellar.In summary:Must get the pork belly and sushi bomb platter. Double skip on the double cheesy risotto balls. Bing bong."

The server was inattentive, as we had to wait for our drinks and beverages. Then wait to get the server's attention to order more. The seaweed salad was overly salty as it was inedible and the sushi wasn't that good that it would justify the prices that they're charging. I won't be coming back here again."

We had a 7 hour layover so I took my sweet time eating this burger and shake. I loved that the shake had real bits of strawberry and the fries are pretty good dipped in the Shack sauce. You have to ask for it though as they don't give it to you standard. Only reason for docking is the condiments station where you get napkins and pump ketchup was a little messy.

Ordering was easy on the kiosk. All in all I waited about 15 minutes for my food. Ordered 2 shack burgers and 2 fries. They were pretty much perfect. Hot crispy fries and perfectly done burgers. Service was great and these employees seem to know how to deal with high volume. I was going to get a beer but it was $14 for a 16oz beer (par for the course at JFK). After tip the meal was about $30. Pricey but I would doubt you'd get anything better for that price at the airport. Great job guys. Loved it."

Notably, Nassau Bar, Port 41, Snafu, Wakamba, Ipanema and The Patriot.However, of those, only Nassau Bar is a true bikini bar, the others are more like ""daisy duke shorts & crop top bars"".Nassau Bar was the 1st bar I went to when I first moved to NYC in 1999.  My boss at Goldman Sachs (when we were at 85 Broad Street) took my group there on my first day at work to introduce me to my new colleagues and the city...8 Beers, 6 Tequila shots and 4am later, I was indoctrinated and sold on NYC.  So, this place has some sentimental value for me.As the years went by, I completely forgot about it, until one day walking home from work a few weeks ago, when I happened to pass it and was shocked that it was still there.  I went in, and it was exactly as it was over 15 years ago, NOTHING has changed.  Which is refreshing given this constantly changing city.Since stumbling in, I've gone back with co-workers for after-work drinks, and even though it seems like this may be a 'guy-only' bar, I've taken a few girl friends of mine and they've enjoyed it and had fun. So, if you want to step back in time for a moment, or just grab some cheap drinks with a good jukebox, or if you're just a creepy old guy that's never seen a woman in a bikini, then this is your spot!And just like Toby Ketih's song, which is on their jukebox...""I Love this Bar""."

Overall, this is a nice place for a cheap date or hangout but if you're looking for a Dave and Buster type place, this is very different."

Tokens are cash only in the back. The games themselves are retro, so definitely not claw machines or anything of that. More like pacman, shooter games, pinball, etc. Some of the games are multiplayer (some 2 player, some up to 4 player). The games weren't too entertaining to be honest, but if you're into them they definitely could be. Close proximity to a lot of restaurants though which is great."
1722,G1HUAEpZcNHXO1V1gLoASQ,2/20/2023,5 star rating,"When looking for a bar to come to as a regular, I look for on that has a great theme, a wide selection of drinks and food, an excellent service. Barcade has hit all of those points with flying colors. The idea of a pub and an arcade in one might sound childish, but this is anything but that with the age minimum and their game selection (which is both diverse and awesome). The selection of drinks is superb and compliments their objective and atmosphere. And finally like the drinks, the games are reasonably priced, with most being 25 cents per game. Overall, this place is perfect to unwind after a long week and to stimulate your inner child."

The vibe is super fun and definitely a step back in time. You have to be 21+ to enter and they card at the door. I loved all the retro games! The tokens go a long way so no need to get too many. My favorite games were the group Pac-Man game since you can compete with your friends and the good old pinball machines!I had the Brooklyn Mule cocktail for my first drink. Unfortunately it really fell flat. It lacked flavor and was definitely not worth the $14 price tag. I switched to one of their draft ciders for my second round and loved it! It was a blood orange hard cider and definitely unique.This is a super fun, retro spot that has a dive bar feel. It's casual and great for a gathering with friends!"
1724,G1HUAEpZcNHXO1V1gLoASQ,1/9/2023,5 star rating,I think I've been to ALL of the barcodes including the one in Jersey City. I'm a long time fan of vintage arcade games and this location is a fix for gamers and pin ballers alike. All the locations vary in their options of games and because this one is near NYU it can get packed with Tinder dates and group parties reserving the tables in the back but is still fun to go to. Bar staff is always attentive as much as possible depending on the ebb and flow of the people waiting to be served. Craft brews are readily available and why not have a hop back (their version of a pickle back) while you're at it? TBH I love the JC one the most because it's just bigger and there are more pin ball machines but Barcade is barcade. I'll go to one no matter where I happen to be. Always my first pick of fun things to do.
1725,G1HUAEpZcNHXO1V1gLoASQ,8/5/2021,4 star rating,"Awesome place to revisit your inner child. Beer, cocktails, and old-school arcades are a perfect mix for fun in the East Village. I will admit that this location is a bit smaller and has fewer arcades than the other Barcades in the city. The place has a pretty chill, relaxed vibe which is perfect for the East Village, and most of the games are about 1-2 tokens. Also, if you want to raid your quarters that have been set aside for laundry, the arcades take both tokens and regular quarters. During our visit, we did not have a chance to try the food; however, I was very please with the wide variety of beers and cocktails. I think that I counted at least 25 different beers, so definitely come to Barcade thirsty. We came around 5 pm on a Sunday, and the place was pretty quiet, but it started to pick up around 6:30 pm.I definitely hope to return in the near future."

This one is considerably smaller and is fairly narrow. Being in the East Village, it can also get fairly crowded on a Friday and Saturday night.However, overall it is still a good place to hang out. And despite having less machines, they have some games I did not see at the other location. Simpsons the Arcade Game, Splatterhouse, Jambo! Safari and Dynamite Cop are some of the ones that come to mind. Good selection of beers and decent quality bar food too."

The space is not very big so with all the games & bar area it's a bit cramped inside. What can u really say about this place? Not much more , old school type arcade games some are good, most are bad. Fun to drink & play games of course but wouldn't really last too long here since the games are ahhh.  Decent music playing, drinks they do have a full bar good enough to kill about an hour or so can't say I would be here too much longer."
1728,G1HUAEpZcNHXO1V1gLoASQ,6/1/2021,3 star rating,"Mixed feelings about Barcade. It's in my regular rotation and I missed it dearly during COVID -- but in the same breath, it's over crowded, overpriced, and the bartenders are usually assholes.The best time to come is in the afternoon, early -- maybe right at 5pm. There is no point in coming if you see a sea of heads once you walk down the ramp. (Even if you're looking to just use the restroom, the lines will be crazy long anyway.)This place is also kind of dirty all the time...lmao. Keep in mind, unlike the other Barcade, this one doesn't have it's liquor license. But the beer selection is updated a decent amount. The menus are easy to read and you can always find some high percentage pints.The games are great, of course. They're a decent amount, but in my 4/5 years of going here, there hasn't been any new additions. While the other location has had new games come in here and there.I get that it's small but hmmm...It's fun, it's a good gimmick. Who doesn't love a bar where you can do something besides take shots and talk?"

But tonight we stopped for bite and not as good as it once was. But.. people need to be careful with dinner receipts.Total bill was attached with breakdown receipt on the bottom that already has added on tip of 18% that was added to the dinner bill but top receipt only shows total amount (included tip) and there also was another tip line. If you don't look closely you will end up paying a tip again to the total amount that that already calculated in the total. Never seen anything like this before anywhere in NY.  I don't know if this is common practice but....

Jjam Jja Myun 8/10 - This comes with both Jja Jjang Myun and Jjampong. The noodles were perfectly bouncy and the sauce was rich and flavorful. I liked that I could enjoy two types of noodles. If you get tired of one, you could eat the other and then switch back .Kimchi Fried Rice with cheese 9/10 - The pairing of cheese and kimchi fried rice is so good together. The kimchi fried rice here was perfect. It had the perfect amount of kimchi and wasn't overbearing salty. I wished the egg on top had a runny yolk, but overall it was a solid dish.The food here was perfect for a late night meal. I would also definitely recommend the cheese on the kimchi fried rice."

The sauces was flavorful but not overly salty, and there was plenty for all the noodles. All in all, a great place for jja jang myun.

The seafood ratio was a little low, they had a crazy amount of onions and I was searching for the octopus. Regardless it was tasty and the noodles were perfectly cooked, portion size was good.

Since, my husband's family eats only Halal food, this spot is one of the closest Chinese Halal joints around Forest Hills, so we decided to order take out from here earlier tonight for a family dinner. Here's some pros and cons about the spot:Service: Great! Friendly and super fast. We ordered a variety of items for dinner pick up. When my husband and I arrived our food was about ready and while we waited, the owner started engaging in small talk with us, about the restaurant and background etc. We enjoyed the friendly conversation while our food was getting packed. Price: Super Cheap! Wow! This place is a winner when it comes to cheap take out! Less than $10 and you can enjoy a large or small side of soup, fried rice, half fried chicken and still have left overs for the next day! Food: Quality of the food is ok, but nothing great.  I was a bit disappointed as when we arrived home we noticed that some of our ordered items were wrong. I specifically asked for the Szechuan Chicken to be dry and after confirming it, it was made with gravy. Too late to go back so I had to settle. Though it didn't taste bad (more like a thai version of basil chicken). Soups: We tried their beef wonton egg drop soup and the chicken corn soup. Both delicious with good amounts of meat in them, though my favorite was the beef wonton soup. $2.75 for a sm or about $3.50 for a lg. Can't beat that deal! Rice: We ordered the beef, chicken and shrimp fried rice. I had the shrimp and felt it lacked on the flavor. Also, shrimp was very little (about 4-5 small pieces). Probably won't get it again. Noodles: We ordered the Beef Chow Fun and Chicken Lo Mein. Though not bad, I wasn't a huge fan of the beef chow fun, though my husband enjoyed it. He even had left over for the next day. Their portions are definitely big and prices low as mentioned.Fried Items: Fried chicken was crisp, fresh and tasty. Not oily as most fast food chains so definitely enjoyed that! Fried fish was not bad either. Though I prefer the fried chicken over the fish. Bottom Line: Friendly place, fast service, Halal Chinese and super cheap prices make this place a great stop. Is it something I'd crave though? No. Is it a place I'd drop by if was hungry and on a budget or seeking Halal food? Yes! Until next time..."

The prices of entrees are very reasonable; none are more than ten bucks. The two women working were extremely nice and served us water while we waited for our food to be ready, and for that we were grateful because we had just finished up a run. My boyfriend had been here before and always orders the curry, while I opted for classic Pad Thai with chicken. When we got home, I busted into the grub. The portions are reasonable, and the food was still piping hot. In my experience, a lot of Thai places either do curry or noodles really well and not both. This is one of those places. The red curry was awesome--not as hot as we would have liked, even after requesting make it as hot as you can! The Pad Thai was just so so, I've definitely had better Pad Thai at other places.I would go back to Thai Cafe but next time, I'd definitely get curry instead of noodles."

It hasn't changed at all - big plates with fresh veggies and perfect combo of fresh and fragrant flavors. I had told so many people about this place over the decades, never dreaming it could still be there, and just as fantastic tasting. It is still my all time favorite Thai food which I have sampled generously across the country. We even got some take-out after we finished eating and will continue to make it a point to come back when I'm in Brooklyn again, or craving their food again! I had the Pad Thai, my boyfriend had the garlic chicken, and if it wasn't for some food allergies I would have had the green curry- the dish I still dream about that after two and a half decades later, that still haunts me! Don't miss this gem."

And a white man who came in after me got the water first. I'm not a racially oversensitive person but that just makes me uncomfortable.For lunch special, I was told there were no Thai salad or curry puff. What?! So I had to choose the least favorite soup and spring roll. Disappointed."

Food tasted similar to, but not exactly like it has in previous years - likely a new cook. I have been going to Thai Cafe ever since it has opened in the 1990s and through the various owners. I went for the classic beef in oyster sauce and broccoli today paired with a thai iced tea. Beef was tender but oyster sauce lacked its signature saltiness. Thai iced tea was on point. I miss the old school flavor of the food and the artwork on the walls."

They reassured me that the cake would be ready, regrettably on the day of my event they informed me that there was no cake claiming my order was pushed aside due to the change- despite my following their every step to confirm!.... my cake was being picked up by my elderly mother who was is no state to argue or advocate on my behalf, the bakery saw this and decided to shout at her that she either take the deposit back or take a simple design, they offered no apology and claimed I never called to confirm (I provided phone logs and what's app messages to prove I did) On the brink of tears my mother decided to take a simple cake as she didn't want to travel back 30 minutes away empty handed.We wanted so badly to support this bakery during such a difficult time, unfortunately this bakery has shown their values in how they treat customers during a pandemic.

I was told they do not have the color rose gold and can do a pink.  Simple right? Well when I get there I call them and woman answers the phone and I mention  I was outside and could not park because there is never parking in the area and I had my young son in the car. I was told I need to come inside to collect the cake and after a couple of back and forth she hangs up the phone on me. I finally get in side and they bring the cake out and it is a mustard yellow and white. I tell them that I could not have possibly ordered that cake because the color theme is rose gold. The woman that takes the phone orders said to me well how did that happen because on the order receipt it says I want the cake in gold and white. She never acknowledged that she took down the order incorrectly and it just went down hill from to the point I wanted to walk without the cake. All of three behind the counter were nasty. They lack professionalism and are not courteous to their customers. I will not be going back and I suggest others should take their money elsewhere. There are other places that sell cakes that are a lot tastier and treat their customers with respect.

One side of the empanada was cold and the other side hot.  They looked oily and tasted greasy.  Even warmed up, the crust was rock hard.  They can improve on that.  I will go back next month to see if there was any improvements regarding the empanadas and rate the store five stars.  They take cash and cards.  (They charge tax if you use debit or credit cards)"

As I write this review, A little after 12:30pm today, my son's birthday cake was picked up. The cake was suppose to be a 2 tier with frosting. When I picked up the cake, it did not have a proper covering. It was just exposed with the covering to the side with tape. Okay fine left with the cake, the cake is in the car behind held properly by my brother in law with the AC on full blast. 5 minutes into the ride the top layer was shaking and the supposedly frosting was melting.  By the time I got to my house 10 minutes later, the cake was disaster. Words cannot explain how piss off me and my wife is. Mind you we ordered cupcakes along with the cake and the cupcakes is totally fine.  Called the bakery, asked to speak to a manager, was on hold for almost 20 minutes and suddenly the call hangs up.

1791,lxQ-tzFmL1tmUqZUN-CSRQ,12/28/2022,4 star rating,"There are not many Taiwanese restaurants in the Long Island City/Astoria area so Yumpling is always our go-to when we're craving some Taiwanese food. What I like most about Yumpling is that we always receive the best service when we go. You are always greeted with a smile and the food takes incredibly fast to prepare. You can expect your food within 10-15 minutes or less. Our go to is always the Crispy Chicken Bian Dang and the Lotus Root Chips. The chicken is always tender and crispy with the right amount of flavor and the lotus root chips always have the perfect amount of seasoning on top. The chips are very thin and are so easy to snack on. We've also tried the lu rou fan which was also seasoned with just the right amount of flavor and came with an egg. I will say that I took a star because of the prices. If you're used to eating at Taiwanese places closer to Bayside in Queens, these prices will seem incredibly high but they're around the price point of what you'd get in the LIC neighborhood for entrees. I'd definitely be back again and highly recommend that you stop by if you're in the neighborhood.Food: 5/5Service: 5/5Price: 3/5"
1792,lxQ-tzFmL1tmUqZUN-CSRQ,1/22/2023,5 star rating,I came here on Thursday night and i really enjoyed it. Now i ordered the spicy chicken sandwich which was so delicious. I also ordered the pork and chives dumplings which were really delicious fresh and nice stuffed. Inside it is brightly lit and the person taking the order was very nice. You can easily get full from the chicken sandwich because it is big enough but I was greedy and was unsure when I would go back. So I ordered both the chicken sandwich and the dumplings. In my dumpling order there were 8 dumplings but I ate 4 and took 4 to go home. I would definitely come back I want to try their other items and the service was great. I paid $24.00 and I thought that was a bit steep but then I did get two items and had leftovers and the food was very fresh so it is fair. Everything is going up so i do understand the pricing of the items. They also had free water which I love.

I got the Spicy Crispy Chicken Bian Dang and Pork Yumplings. For my bian dang, I selected the spicy cucumbers as my veggie. The chicken was delicious - so crispy and flavorful. The dumplings had the most delicious sauce on them. The outside was crispy, but also chewy. Overall, great experience with this one!"
1794,lxQ-tzFmL1tmUqZUN-CSRQ,1/9/2023,5 star rating,"I've eaten at Yumpling more than I can count on my hands. They have the best sauced up dumpings of any sit down restaurant I've been to in NYC. They also have the most tender and well seasoned popcorn chicken. Their bowls (both pork, chicken and eggplant) are all delicious. I love that they add in the pickled veggies for extra flavor to the bowls. The pickled lotus roots and the lotus root chips are mind blowing delicious if you like pickled stuff. I have low acidity tolerance due to my stomach and I will still eat an entire order of this without hesitation. It's that good."

1798,lxQ-tzFmL1tmUqZUN-CSRQ,8/5/2022,4 star rating,"Came here on a Saturday for dessert and the place wasn't too busy which made it easy to order and get a seat. The space is relatively small and quaint, but there are booths and tables to eat and enjoy your food so overall it felt pretty nice. We split a mango shaved ice dessert with added taro pieces and it was pretty solid. A little hard to eat as over time it froze into a somewhat large chunk of ice, but the flavor and consistency were nice and refreshing for a hot summer day. There was a good mixture of fruit and other toppings which made the dessert overall taste very balanced and deliciously sweet.Overall, I found the dessert well-priced and the service was super quick and reliable. I'd love to come back to try their food and drinks as well another time!"

We ended up having ""brunch"" - omelettes and a sausage sandwich. The waitress was very attentive and the place was no frills - very Brooklyn diner, which I like. The prices also reflected the low-key nature of the establishment, and the clientele was not presumptive. Overall, it was great and if I need a low-key bite again when around the neighborhood, I know where I can count on to not pay $20 for eggs and mimosa."

The staff is friendly and helpful. The wrap itself was big and tasty. The grilled chicken ACTUALLY has flavor. It was so big I only ate half. I cant wait to try the Caesar salad or even their Spanish food. Wrap was $7...not too bad for Dwntwn BK and for the size it was good. Oh they have breakfast options too.

Not really sure if they used pernil they made today or what kind of ham they used but, niether one had any flavor just very very salty. Pickles were mushy not crisp and had that tangy flavor of being opened weeks ago and sitting out. I asked for mustard and mayo and it was no lie, a thin coating. Just not a very good or well put together sandwhich. And the coffee was so murky you can taste that pot after pot was tossed into that pot continuously all day.Please take your tastebuds and hard earned money elsewhere. DESERVES ABSOLUTELY NO STARS. Even the staff was dry and boring like the sandwhich which required a 101 ounce bottle of water with all the salt."

1811,p8AgZ2gvBNdriyy2j5cZNQ,12/29/2021,2 star rating,"I'm disappointed with roots cafe. Recent visits, some staff behave as if I'm inconveniencing them. I've been the recipient of passive aggressive comments more then once. Second, their hours constantly change. Sometimes I get there at the listed opening hour, and their still opening and not ready for service. Further, they are consistently out of the vegan scones. When I ask why, I'm told the baker didn't deliver it (happened twice in the past couple of months). All this is really frustrating when I go out of my way to visit (don't live near by) only to leave disappointed. When they get it right, it's a great place because they are so vegan friendly and some of the staff have been incredibly sweet. Just today I showed up at 8 am. They were running around setting up seating, so I patiently waited. When I got their attention, I asked for the vegan scone. I was told the baker didn't deliver it today. After some friendly back and forth with a very kind barista, I left. On my way out, another staff member said in a passive aggressive tone, we're out of that pastry-as if my asking and wanting to know more was problematic. So, I've given up on this place because it's not reliable. Here is one idea in case the cafe reads this: List the pastries online and indicate if their sold out or unavailable. This way I'd know not to make the trip and/or order ahead if I knew it was available. I know these are tough times for small business, so I write this hesitantly. When their on and the shelves are stocked, roots is a great local spot.I just want to know if what I love is available, and that I'm valued as a customer."

Not welcoming to dogs, which is quite upsetting, but welcoming to little monsters and their enabling Park Slope parents.

Easy reservations and BYOB (just wine, no beer).The appetizers were okay - some of it was a too bit doughy/fried for me. My favorite was probably the Assorted Sizzling Rice Soup. The Peking Duck came wrapped with cucumbers and sauce. Lobsters were good. The rest was OK - not great, not too bad. The noodles were pretty disappointing. We ended up getting fried rice as extra - and it was pretty good. Loved the Fried Banana w. Walnuts at the end!Overall, we had a great time and left feeling super full.

The peking duck was not really crispy and just not as good as the other ones I've had before. Overall, for the price, the amount of food was ok, but the taste and quality of the food was not really worth it."

The dumpling wrappers were hard and thick, and I'm fairly certain they were prebought wrappers. Duck was good, as was the sauce. However, rather than traditional wrappers, they gave us gigantic tortillas."

The presentation of the food was pretty nice, they showed us the whole duck as soon as it came out and sliced it in front of us. And to some peoples surprise I never liked duck until I came this restaurant. Definitely will take my parents here when we can the next time we're ever in NY."

They said their son who now lives in DC begs to go there whenever he's back in town.So we went.And it was FAB-U-LOUS.The atmosphere was old-school upscale, the chef came out to the carving table and carved up our duck where we could watch. The floor manager was very informative and helpful. When the chef brought over our duck, we admitted that we had no idea what we were supposed to do with the crepes and vegetables included separately with our duck... shavings? Cutlets? Ducklets? So he asked for one of our plates and said he'd be happy to demonstrate and then we'd be able to put together our own duck crepes. (I then looked him straight in the face and said, ""I applaud your faith in us."" He was wearing a mask and so I only saw his eyes crinkle up and he kind of hunched his shoulders in suppressed laughter, so I could tell I'd cracked him up. Score.)What else can be said. Go here for great Peking Duck!"

I don't know why my parents never took us here to dine as a family. It wasn't until I was much older that I took my mom here for a meal when I got my first part-time job. We celebrated her birthday here last year. Thought it was high time I write a review.As we were deciding what to order I say to my two nephews...Me: You guys excited for some amazing Peking duck?Older nephew: I never had it before.Younger nephew: Neither have I.Me: What do you mean you never had Peking duck? Like not even over rice?Nephews: NEVER.Me: (I almost fell off my chair) But you're Chinese for goodness sakes.My sister and BIL are not Peking duck eaters, I guess that explains it. As I show my nephews how to assemble their first ever wrap, my son is already grabbing all the best pieces. As I eagerly watch them take their first bite, their eyes widened and I can tell that they loved it. How much did they enjoyed it? We had to order another whole duck. In my opinion, this is one of the best places for a traditional Peking duck. You can ask for the wrap or bao and make sure you spread some of that Hoisin sauce and top it with scallions and cucumbers. Frankly, I can eat the whole duck myself. Two dishes I have to mention here that I love to get is their Crispy Fish Fillet that is fried in seaweed. It's really delish when you dip it in some salt. I also recommend their Sautéed Shredded Pork with Bean Curd Sheet and Beans.It's rare to see any of the waiters smiling because I can tell the owner runs a tight ship with his staff. At times, I think they look stressed. But let me emphasize, service is excellent and very professional.Reservations are recommended.Good thing my sister is not a Yelper."

We had to modify our reservations last minute and the staff was just consummate professionals. We ended up sitting in the bar area (still full service) and it was great. The host, Kem, was warm, friendly, and professional. The bartender, Emily, made excellent, balanced cocktails and provided attentive but not overwhelming service.I had eggs florentine for my meal which had amazing poached eggs on top of a savory home-made biscuit. The hollandaise sauce was creamy and flavorful and left me satiated.If you're not from the area, the price is going to seem hefty.

I loved that it was served over biscuits versus the usual english muffins. Our only problem was that we all felt that out food was very overpriced. My friends ordered the pasta and one of the burgers and though we all enjoyed our meals, for the quantity and the quality of the food we felt the process were not justified.

We were really surprised when we were able to make a last minute reservation that morning for 6 of us! We all arrived separately so we had to wait until everyone from our party had arrived before we went to our table. That Saturday for brunch the restaurant wasn't too crowded and seemed like if you came without a reservation you'd probably get a spot fairly quickly. For food my friend and I split the Turkish Eggs and Avocado Toast. Our whole group also got a couple orders of biscuits for the table. The biscuits came out first and we dove right in. They were a little disappointing as the bottoms of all the biscuits were over baked and had a little bit of a burnt taste to them. I was also a little underwhelmed by the Avocado Toast. Maybe I should have expected it, but it was a really ordinary dish and didn't feel worth the price. I really did enjoy the Turkish Eggs, however! They were really tasty and the perfect balance of flavor and creaminess. The dish came with bread to eat with so it was a delightful pairing."

The first time I got this cheesecake earlier in the day from another location of this same chain, the cheesecake was fantastic so I learned the hard way that the consistency isn't predictable.My kids love to get the savory items on the menu and they loved the little cake they picked up (it was soft, chiffon like texture with the perfect balance of sugar)."

If you want it to go just tell them at checkout and they will bag it for you. You can select from a wide array of pastries, sweets and others. They also have hot food you can order to be warmed up. They also have a variety of drinks as well, the milk ice coffee is very good. We got a chocolate croissant filled with chocolate cream and a cream cheese danish, both were very good. The staff is very friendly and were very helpful.definitely would come back here again."

I enjoy the small pastries as a morning snack with coffee. I've never had a problem with customer service. The Paris Baguette employees appear to be well trained in their products. I'm recommending if you're in the neighborhood."

Essentially all sandwiches include sausage, tuna or other meats. A few plant based and other healthy options like Pret would upgrade the selection.

Really pretty display of all the baked goodies but I really wanted to try their Japanese style 'fluffy cheesecake'. Mine was picked up around 3 pm and it had a staleness to it. There was a smell of dairy that wasn't just right. The first time I got this cheesecake earlier in the day from another location of this same chain, the cheesecake was fantastic so I learned the hard way that the consistency isn't predictable.My kids love to get the savory items on the menu and they loved the little cake they picked up (it was soft, chiffon like texture with the perfect balance of sugar)."

I'm not a huge fan of cake, but these cake pieces were decent and I enjoyed the fresh fruit. Personally, I preferred the taste of the mango cake over the blueberry cake. The taste of the pumpkin spice latte was average. Overall, this was a pleasant environment for a quick get together."

It's our regular go to breakfast place.At some points it can be very noisy but if you go at the right time it's a nice place to sit down as well.The only downside is that three times now I have bought the green tea chai and got regular chai instead. Not the end of the world so I didn't make a fuss.

Pros:-Quick service-Kind staff-Good prices (latte and sandwich cost the same as my latte from another establishment yesterday)-Lots of COVID precautions in place-The don't charge extra for different milk or for flavoring. Cons:-Looking at the Yelp Health score made me a bit nervous-Not a con but just a notice - the sandwich was just like a bodega egg and cheese (with a way fresher bun than my normal bodega)I'll definitely be going back and I'm interested in the lunch sandwiches that look delicious. Based on the COVID precautions, I think the score would be higher now? Also post- COVID this would be a great place to work."

I understand that during these uncertain Covid times you don't want paying customers to use your bathroom but if have tables all over your place you NEED to allow customers to use your bathroom especially paying customers!! If you don't want riff raff coming in, not buying anything, and using your bathroom that's fine. Don't make your paying customers suffer. Better yet, customers should take their business elsewhere if they are going to be discriminated against. We know your bathroom works otherwise where are the employees going to use the bathroom??The coffee and food is decent. Respect your customers."

1908,Qlt-_S3DXB0qujSAoRrZrw,3/2/2020,4 star rating,This place was recommended to me from the Brooklyn writers project. I have to admit this is a great space to write. It's Low key and right on Nostrand avenue not far at all from Atlantic avenue.All of the workers were great and friendly. The regulars that came in seemed to be chatty and overall easy to be around. The latte was good. I won't lie and say was exceptional but for the vibe plus the good food everything went well. This is a great place to work. If you're in Brooklyn around Nostrand Ave I highly recommend this place to get work done.

I hung out in the nice window table watching the neighborhood wake up and enjoyed my coffee.  They had a tv with NY Sports channel on so I caught up on the games from the day before.    I came back an hour later when my wife got up and we had coffee and 2 bagels with cream cheese.  Again the staff/ owners were courteous and attentive. We will definitely be back when I am in the neighborhood!

Don't listen to the nagging Debby downer reviews, I'm not sure they quite understand the value of money yet. Yes, less then $10 for an entire meal, hot, and has that fast food deliciousness, not served on silver platters, but nonetheless they'll continue to be open for business for late night cravings or low on cash days, or those days when you just want a tasty real frozen chicken breast cooked over a greesy grill with some fries."

I hate to compare it to other fast food places in the area but their double cheeseburgers are bigger than a whopper and the fried chicken is better than KFC.

I'd like to see them be super successful here. Never mind the haters who rate them any less.

I liked the crispy rice with tuna - the rice was quite crispy and chewy, which I liked. The meat in the clay pot rice was tasty but I found to rice way too sweet. The crispy duck bun was a twist on the Beijing duck dish, and I prefer the original. Finally, we got the mango sticky rice which was so exceedingly sweet it was nearly inedible."

I liked the crispy rice with tuna - the rice was quite crispy and chewy, which I liked. The meat in the clay pot rice was tasty but I found to rice way too sweet.

1972,ldOnttp7mbbCxI4_J6v4iA,12/12/2022,3 star rating,"I love desserts especially bingsu as it's always refreshing and sweet at the same time. Based on recent reviews, I opted out of my normal fruit options for bingsu as most people were more impressed with the chocolate volcano version. I hate to say it, but the chocolate version was hard to eat. I actually gave up halfway as the flavors were not fully integrated so each bite didn't have that pizazz I always expect from my bingsu. The shaved ice wasn't creamy but felt like eating dry snow, if that makes any sense. Each bite actually was dry since the toppings are chips ahoy, marshmallows, Oreos and milo powder. I'm giving 3 stars as I may return to try the fruit options but I know a few other places, only in the summer though, that serve amazing fresh fruit options. The service on the other hand was impeccable and sweet!"

Jackson heights definitely benefits from an asian dessert place and overall bingsoo was really good, fluffy and creamy. The signature OD Toast was good but not mind-blowingMANGO BINGSOORefreshingly, light, not too sweet, and again the ice is SO creamy. What i love is that they give you the syrup on the side so you can decide how much you want to use for your taste buds.VOLCANO BINGSOOThis was really delicious too because they crushed up oreos/ chocolate chip cookies and dusted it with milo powder and have a really delicious and not saccharine chocolate syrup that goes over it. This one I liked more than the mango one just cause you get more of a mix of textures, esp with the frosted flakes sprinkled over top. I love a crunch and the syrup itself wasn't too sweet which i liked.OD TOASTTheir signature item that I was excited to try. It's essentially a column of golden toast filled with either pandan or thai tea filling. The filling itself is injected into the toast and it's a cool concept; the flavors of the filling were pretty good and the thai tea had some coconut flavoring as well. I wish the texture was more melty and less runny though, like a custard, because it runs out of one side of the toast and doesn't necessarily stay in the bread. BLUE MOUNTAIN COFFEE SLUSHA pretty standard coffee flavored slush but they did a good job not making it too sweet so the coffee flavor stands out and remains on the bolder side. The ice wasn't super well blended with the rest of the drink so you do get bits of just ice randomly and it's not a smooth homogeneous slush, per se."

The toast has the perfect texture of soft in the inside oozing with pandan and a bit crispy on the outside, melting inside your mouth. The OD toast comes with a side of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream so you can have a combination of the drier toast with the moist creamier sides. I didn't have as much of the lychee bingsu as I devoured the toast, but the bingsu comes with bigger lychee pieces that blend well with the soft shaved ice."

It isn't as sweet as many would like, but with the condensed milk and lychee syrup it was a great fix after a big meal. Service: 5/5"

It's called HOT FOR COOKIES! From the picture it looked like if have trouble finishing it but it was more then I expected. After I parted the mountain of whip cream and chocolate pieces I finally got to the ice cream and 2 big chocolate chip cookies. The warm cookies went great with he cold ice cream.

1987,hmdm-dO72hLsMQwQRcGEUQ,6/24/2016,2 star rating,"Now I know why I never came back since the last time I was here. The ice cream is so bad... Maybe it's just this location but man is the ice cream here aweful. You're paying about $5-10 depending on the size you get and you are getting some of the worst ice cream you'll ever taste. I came here after watching a movie across the street knowing it was a bad idea to come here but I came anyway.   And I regret it so much.I ordered the signature ""the pie who loved me"": cheese cake, Oreo, graham cracker, and vanilla ice cream. Sounds nice but tasted God aweful. The ice cream was sour, the kind of sour that tastes spoiled. The cheesecake was nonexistent... Might as well just call t Oreo ice cream. The ice cream texture was like butter and left behind this terrible oil feel in your mouth. Took 2 bites and threw it out (the second bite was wishful thinking, maybe I'll like it the second time I try... Nope)If you know cold stones then you know they are known for mixing your ice cream infront of you. I tell you now it's NOT that fascinating and the ice cream is not worth it at the end. Here's a tip: save yourself some trouble and money by going to a supermarket, buy a tub of generic ice cream, add whatever toppings you like and mash it up then you'll have ""cold stones""....I'm never coming back.Two stars for service. Our ice cream server was very nice."
1988,hmdm-dO72hLsMQwQRcGEUQ,9/9/2016,2 star rating,"I went here with a friend on a Sunday Night. The line was so long, and at first i thought its okay because they are usually understaffed. However, there were atleast 5-6 workers there. What caught me by surprise is that all of the workers were just chatting with each other. They would take a customers order and just talk amongst each other, sometimes stopping to talk to each other while making the ice creams. I thought that to be very unprofessional, considering the line of people they had. Also, not only was the wait very long, but i was overcharged. The prices posted on the wall clearly state that a ""Like It"" ice cream in a cup costs $5.29. Also, it says your first add-on is supposed to be free, and every one after that is 95 cents. I purchased a ""Like It"" ice cream in a cup with ONE add on. Not only was I charged $5.79, which is a ""Love It"" price, but i was also charged 95 cents for my one add-on. I knew that something was wrong so I even asked the worker who rang me up how much a ""Like It"" cup costs and he said $5.76. If that was the case and the prices were actually raised, they need to change their prices on the wall because it is deceiving to the customer."

Tasty and delicious.  My dinning partner had the spicy pineapple margarita made with mezcal. Perfecto.  Then we tried the queso fondue. Wonderful with warm tortillas to hold the perfectly spiced queso. A great appetizer. Try the cheese with chips Eid you like a more crunchy experience. And the pollo asada with cucumber salad. Beautifully grilled and a wonderful combination. The place has a wonderful covers outside part of the restaurant which I would highly recommend.

I have been a life long Starbucks customer but now honestly it's really too awful to bear being treated like a piece of garbage..."
2001,97zuXSmmdJw5mE1HVB5JaQ,11/22/2017,1 star rating,"In the age of bullet trains and same day delivery options on Amazon, why oh  why does it take 14 minutes for this location to make my coffee?Today wasn't the first time this happened but it will be my last. When I'm short for time, MOST other Starbucks are good with speed. I even know the hacks like, just grab a drip coffee when you gotta go, or don't let them add milk because for some perplexing reason, this adds at least 3 minutes to your order time. This location is always crowded in the mornings so I try to go slightly after the 3pm rush for a pick me up coffee. The three different times I've tried this, I've waited for no shorter than 14 minutes each time. This time, I counted 4 behind the counter - and one slowly, begrudgingly cleaning off the not-really-that-dirty milk counter. I'll get back to this person later.So as I stand there, there are like 30 mobile orders called, none of which are picked up. There are only 3 people in line waiting for their physical in real life order to be made and we all stand there for like 7 minutes. Then a barista behind the bar starts inexplicably organizing metal trays -as slowly as she possibly could.

He doesn't know what he is doing and this kinda shit happens way too often. It's bad enough to be spending so much money on coffee, but to spend all of that money and not even get what you ordered is infuriating.

I look forward to the pumpkin cream cold brew all yeah and it's finally that season, yet out of the 15 tries I have truly only received ONE that was made the way it is supposed to be and tasted good. I get Starbucks coffee year round and legitimately at least 6 days a week. This is so disappointing and Starbucks is definitely losing a customer here"

Out of the 6 times I've tried going there, they got my order correct once (but not really since they didn't have the almond milk I requested and already paid extra for). One time they completely forgot about my order for 20 minutes until I went back up to the counter to ask about it (at which point I said forget it and asked for a refund); one time I waited on line for six minutes with three people ahead of me and I left because the line had not moved; and THREE times I left with my drink only to discover it was not the drink I ordered. I have also seen other customers go back up to the counter complaining about their drinks not being right. On top of all this, the store is not very clean. I've witnessed someone spill their drink at the pickup counter and the employees were right there and did not notice...when someone pointed it out to them they mopped and returned right to making drinks. So gross."

When I'm short for time, MOST other Starbucks are good with speed. I even know the hacks like, just grab a drip coffee when you gotta go, or don't let them add milk because for some perplexing reason, this adds at least 3 minutes to your order time. This location is always crowded in the mornings so I try to go slightly after the 3pm rush for a pick me up coffee. The three different times I've tried this, I've waited for no shorter than 14 minutes each time. This time, I counted 4 behind the counter - and one slowly, begrudgingly cleaning off the not-really-that-dirty milk counter. I'll get back to this person later.So as I stand there, there are like 30 mobile orders called, none of which are picked up. There are only 3 people in line waiting for their physical in real life order to be made and we all stand there for like 7 minutes. Then a barista behind the bar starts inexplicably organizing metal trays -as slowly as she possibly could.

YES!!!The food, the seating, even the little bottles of hand sanitizer at each table showed such great attention to detail.   Just look at our food.   I'd eat three meals a day here!"

The area is supreme and gives all the best Fort Green vibes! I ordered the Brisket Sandwich: slow-cooked brisket with coconut curry slaw in a toasted stirato. It was soooo good I could literally eat it again for the rest of my life. I also ordered a green juice and iced matcha latte.

Management worked with me, but not without being rude and condescending.The server noted to another customer that there is a slight rush with ordering food and eating. So i just told the server I wanted bacon and eggs, which I saw was an option as sides on their Yelp menu photos. My plate came out with a bunch of extra stuff -- red pepper and cheese on the eggs, and a salad with vinegar dressing, all of which I am sensitive to from an autoimmune issue. I didn't receive any indication from the server that ""bacon and eggs"" would have all these extra ingredients. They brought me another plate of eggs, which still had cheese in it. So I sent it back. When it came back, the avacado I paid extra for was gone. I certainly wasn't going to bring that up since I couldn't take any more condescending remarks. I just wanted to leave."

I'm not a fan of DNA lying around food establishments.They didn't have what I asked for (delivery not in yet) so got substitute. Easy enough. I waited and saw more hair. Get food, hop in the car and eat back to Philly. Unwrap the 'chicken' and it was beef. I called. The server pleasantly told me it was chicken 'jerk chicken'. Now i think I'm a fool. I look at it again, take a bite-- nope! This is beef. I call back just as I'm at the bridge. 'Well you can bring it back' 'I'm on my way home to Philly. I can't'. ' You can send an email (no manager there)'.Email sent with pics. I immediately get a response. Refund and gift card. GREAT!

If you are writing reviews, you are part of the problem I.e. Gentrification.

But, when the bartender greats you by name after only short visit, I pay attention. So #%!^ off you self-righteous pricks. The space isn't great, but what original building space around here is? Fantastic barkeeps, and a feeling of home when you are there. I think the Danes call it hygge. Look it up mofo."

I moved to the neighborhood a few months ago and he has helped make it feel like home more than anyone else. He makes it a point to remember someone's name and drink of choice. Always smiles in a genuine way and engages in meaningful convo, not just in the ""buy more drinks from me"" way that bartenders do. As someone who worked in the bartending industry for years, I'd say he is the top of the top. 10/10 recommend this place and specifically him :)"

Good whiskey selection, too!I've only been hanging around the neighborhood since 2007/2008 so I'm not a life-long Bushwick resident but it seems that all the bad reviews are coming from people who are butthurt over Cain's Tavern.  Get over it, neighborhoods change, bars change, etc.  Lets all grab a whiskey now."

They have a good list of staples on the menu and everything from the chairs and decor to the service matches that vibe. To me both the food and the liquor situation were disappointing. They don't have a cocktail list, and when we asked for one they just said ""we have a full bar, can make anything."" For beer, they have two beers - Amstel Light and Pilsner Urquell. For food we started with a Caprese, which was extremely forgettable. Thick sliced semi-ripe tomato with supermarket grade mozzarella on top.  I had the gnocchi for dinner. The gnocchi were pillowy and delightful, but the cream sauce was largely without flavor and the dish was overall disappointing. The staff were accommodating and nice, and we ended up being one of the later parties there on a Thursday."

They have a range of soups and appetizers from seafood and veggies to meat. We had the fried calamari and zucchini as well as the mushroom polenta. Both dishes were wonderful - the calamari was lightly fried and paired well with the tomato sauce. The polenta was creamy and perfect with the slight truffle flavored mushrooms.For mains, we tried the seafood pasta and bolognese pasta, appetizer size, which was perfect for a lunch portion! The seafood was solid and bolognese was good but nothing special.Overall, it was a great lunch experience. Service was fast and friendly and an effort was made to distance between tables. There's also heating in the outdoor area and plastic coverings between tables. Looking forward to coming back for a decadent lunch again sometime."

Wait staff consistently presented the wrong meal to the wrong person.  Service was agonizingly slow and inattentive.  No attempt was made to clean the table between courses.  Wait staff switched halfway through meal.  The restaurant was overcrowded and I will never forget the waiter clearing a neighboring table using a stake knife to roll muscle shells onto a plate.  Not fine dining."

I've been let down a few times in the past, but Totto Ramen is definitely one of the exceptions. The place is as tiny as advertised, with some long lines during busier times but service is expeditious and we didn't have to wait long one Saturday evening. I ordered the pork bun (always a good idea) to start, with a specialty Ramen dish I can't quite remember. The Ramen was seasoned perfectly, not overly salty like some places, and the meat portions were more than serviceable. An egg is also heavily recommended in any Ramen dish in my opinion. So far, just a shade below Ippudo for my favorite Ramen restaurant thus far."

When we arrived at noon for weekday lunch, there was no wait at all, and we were seated and served very quickly. We got the regular chicken paitan and the mega, and they were actually quite different. The mega included different types of meat in addition to char siu (all very tender), a ramen egg, and wavy noodles instead of the straight noods. The broth was super creamy, albeit with a strong chicken flavor, but not too salty. It definitely felt like a heavy meal at the end. The price was very reasonable, but do be aware that if you ask for spicy sauce on the side, it costs $2 extra.We thought the wavy noodles tasted better, so it might be worth asking if you can replace them if you're ordering a dish that comes with straight noodles!"

My friends and I sat on the bar and ordered our Ramens, I loved how when I was eating the noodles it wasn't too spicy but once I got to the broth that's when I was hit. I wish I had the stomach to eat more because it was that good. If you're in the NY area and need a Ramen suggestion 10000% recommendation right here.

2109,dzwa-zvkW6L2ZUGyNGrmuA,11/7/2019,4 star rating,"Theres 3 locations in NYC at 52/10, 51/9 or 52/2. Cash only but this is NYC and ATMs are abound. This one is the OG where the hype & love started, as you can see from Yelp's 5000+ reviews.Place is small, fits maybe 20-25 max with chair to chair crowdedness. Write your name on the list... our party of 2 on 6:15pm Tuesday night had 15min ish wait.Beer sake drink options. Appetizers like dumplings or cucumbers (the latter a bit too seasoned). Food comes quick.Customize your own ramen or choose from 6 bases (chicken broth or veggie), 2 noodle styles (straight or wavy) and 3 firmness (soft to reg to firm). Add whatever toppings for $ extra. But I got maybe 2 pieces of spinach that was NOT worth the $2 I paid for it... especially since I know how easy it is to get the humungous bulk pack of spinach from Costco. Or maybe I'm just too poor to enjoy NYC prices.Ramen was very good. Firm noodles are great for soaking up the flavor & meat is done very tender. But broth is on salty side... is there a low-sodium option? Drank alot of water, and could not slurp up the broth (which should be the favorite finishing touch). With drinks and tip, was about $30/person."

2114,XYyIWs-3J4bZRZDfcsMquQ,9/22/2021,3 star rating,"The dimsum here was good, but not great. I like the fact there are vegetarian options for dimsum regardless (though I claim not to be a vegetarian). Also, I love it wasn't crazy busy here on a Sunday like other dimsum spots. Came on a Sunday and was seated immediately outdoors, though indoor is also an option. We ordered a few usual dimsum favorites, and it was an overload of carbs; vegetarian mock shrimp dumplings, mock roast pork buns, mini sticky rice in lotus leaves, fried wonton, mashed taro treasure boxes, steamed turnip cakes, and rice rolls with chinese kale. On the table, they supply soy sauce and chili oil. The selection isn't bad, but it's more limited next to a full regular dim sum. I liked the food overall, but I still found a lot of it on the blander side. I had to use a lot of soy sauce and chili oil to compensate, but even that wasn't enough. Everything just needed a bit more punch in seasoning, though I thought the mock meats were good substitutions for the real thing. Does it compare to real meat? Definitely not, but again that's not what we are here for. The portion sizes were bigger than expected. For instance, the turnip cakes came in a portion for 3, the lotus leave rice was in 2. It was a bit much for just 2 people, but if you're with 3 or 4 people, it's perfect. Overall, a good variety of dim sum, but lacking in flavor a bit. I don't say that because it's not real meat though. I used a lot of soy sauce and such, but I wish I didn't have to. On the other hand, I'd be happy to return, but I'm more eager to try other dimsum spots first."
2115,XYyIWs-3J4bZRZDfcsMquQ,9/18/2021,3 star rating,Was really pleased with the quality of the dim sum here. Especially liked the mushroom rice rolls and the bean curd rolls. The bbq pork also does not disappoint! Three stars because they used so many single-use plastic items. Definitely can be more environmentally friendly.
2116,XYyIWs-3J4bZRZDfcsMquQ,4/10/2022,1 star rating,"Two of the three dim sum items I ordered were cold and not steamed through. The rice flour dough on all the items were too thick; I had to dig through to get to the filling, and left lots of dough on my plate. What's more, the servers were spraying bleach cleaner on the tables. In a poorly ventilated restaurant, the bleach fumes were perceptible while we ate. It took everything in me to not tell the couple who were seated nearby to leave and save themselves from wasting time and money."

We even translated peanut allergy into mandarin to be sure the server could understand. Low and behold there was peanuts because my friend with a severe allergy started to react. We approached the staff again to stress the importance. "" no peanuts no peanuts"" until my friend said "" I can die if I have peanuts"" the staff responded ""ok a little peanut in the sauce"" the fact that staff would lie about an ingredient that could kill my friend is disgusting. She had to use her epi pen outside the restaurant and was crying. Would never come back here. Lack of integrity"

2119,XYyIWs-3J4bZRZDfcsMquQ,3/24/2022,2 star rating,"I like to be fair. And I really don't like to leave bad reviews. I stumbled upon this place with a friend after walking around aimlessly trying to settle on a place to eat. What sold this place to her was the spinach dumplings. For me personally, I would've preferred to stick to a place that sells meat dishes but I figured why not?Upon entering, the atmosphere was weird. There was no music playing overhead. No noise from a TV or kitchen background noise. You could only hear the conversations the other customers here were engaging in. The hostess/waitress greeted us, asked to see our vaccination cards and took us to our table. Once at our table, I have a tendency to look at everything, on our table, on the walls, the customers, you know trying to take it all in. The place looked a tad dingy. The walls were covered in green paint/wallpaper. The carpet looked like it hadn't seen the vacuum or a nice clean in a while. I could've overlooked these factors until my fingers touched our table. I subconsciously decided to slide my finger on the table and I could tell it hadn't been cleaned in a while. It had this thick layer on the surface of something I can't even name. Although it felt dirty, nothing gross visibly appeared on my finger so I was relieved. I also decided to touch the plates and utensils on our table. They also felt like they hadn't been properly washed. The menu is of course vegetarian. They do however, offer some mock meat dishes but I decided to not risk my chances with those dishes. My friend ordered the spinach dumplings and a vegetarian wonton soup. The spinach dumplings were terrible. The doughy exterior was thick and tasteless. Although I didn't get to taste the wonton soup. My friend enjoyed it more than the dumplings. I had the pan fried noodles with broccoli. That was delicious. I was glad that it turned out great.Putting the vegetarian menu aside, I wouldn't really come back here or recommend. There are other places that sell meat and veggie options. The prices for the food are great. Our bill didn't go over $40. And although I have nothing to complain in regards to the service (our waitress, the only one, was pretty on top of her stuff), I wasn't really impressed by the place despite the location."

Gave it a go after trying the other more popular Vegetarian dim sum spot.My first impression is that the restaurant is more old school style. Decor is non-existent and it looks dark indoor despite all the lights were on and it was day time when I visited.Taste wise, the braised beancurd with rice was good. The Buddha beancurd rolls and fried taro treasure box were meh.....Prices were also significantly higher than the other popular vegan spot in Chinatown.  I will opt to go to the more popular spot instead."

Buddha Bodai is my go-to vegetarian dim sum place in Chinatown, and they're way better. Just a short walk away too!This place just oozes old school Chinatown. It's dimly lit. The walls are a disgusting shade of green. None of the chairs match and are on the edge of being broken. The ceiling consists of office-style drop tiles.The food also wasn't great. Their menu is pretty confusing if you don't read Chinese. They call things super random other things. For instance, what most places call taro dumplings, they call mashed taro treasure boxes. Why? Also, those sucked. They were sour for some reason.The pan fried turnip cakes were also weird and amorphous. I don't understand how they fucked that up. With the exception of the dried shrimp, turnip cakes are ALREADY vegetarian! Theirs were incredibly gloopy and hard to eat.The vegetarian har gow (shrimp dumplings) were also not great. The ""shrimp"" was completely tasteless. The texture was shrimp-like, but that was about it.But hey, I guess if you're with people with dietary restrictions and it's late, this place is good to have around as a third or fourth option. Cash only though."

We opted to sit outside for faster seating, and ordered Happy Hour oysters ($1.50/oyster), cocktails, karaage, 1 of each bao, and ramen over the course of our dining experience. All-in-all, good food but expensive for such small portions.Food:Oysters (3.5/5) - small & very little meat; only worth it for HH pricesKaraage (4/5) - juicy & paired well with the matcha salt, but small portions & needed a dipping sauceDeviled Eggs (5/5) - can't go wrong with uni & salmon roe Assorted Baos (4/5) - delicious, but only 1/order; shrimp bao had only 1 shrimp in itKyoto Ramen (4/5) - pork belly was boiled instead of charred; needed to order extra noodles & meat for it to be fillingSapporo Ramen (3/5) - delicious broth, but only had 1 piece of chicken (equal to 2 ounces at most)  in the entire bowlDrinks:Matcha (5/5) - delicious, creamy, hint of sweetness; even the non-whiskey drinkers enjoyed itEarl Grey (2/5) - could only taste the grapefruitMelon + Sage (4.5/5) - smooth with a slightly peaty aftertasteJapanese Old Fashion (3/5) - average, nothing specialService:Despite sitting outside, the wait staff stopped by our table every 15-20 minute. We timed our ordering with their visits to our table so things went smoothly.Overall, 3.5/5 for our experience. Though the food was good overall, these prices and portions are what you expect in Lower Manhattan, which we don't frequent much for that very reason. The shady business practice we saw/overheard knocked our rating down a star (see below). The shadiness:We witnessed some shady business practices directed at the table next to ours. The regular ordered as soon as she was seated: a cocktail, 12 HH oysters, and ramen to-go. The cocktail & bagged ramen came out in the first 15-20min; she asked the waitstaff about the oysters, but stayed waiting. After almost 40 minutes of waiting, her oysters never came so she asked the staff to remove them from the bill so she could pay & leave.Magically, 5 min later the oysters appeared, but she had already asked for them to be removed from her bill. The waiter argued with her insisting she pay for the late food she no longer wanted, but begrudgingly agreed to remove it and brought out a new bill. The new bill came out to the same total as the previous one; though they removed the oysters from the receipt, it seemed as though they increased the charge for her 1 cocktail & ramen to match the previous total with the oysters. She asked for the previous receipt to compare the two, and the waiter pulled a 180 ""I don't speak English"" gag. SHADY AF! Fed tf up, the customer paid the bill and left. They lost a regular with that one.After witnessing that on top of an average restaurant experience, we won't be going back either."

2135,sswuN6W-p8wpIeQIoGuHmQ,2/21/2019,3 star rating,"Pizza 73% delicious27% Also delicious If you're looking for pizza while visiting NYC, I have good news for you...you're in luck. You can find pizza on every block. It's like people are obsessed with pizza...you probably know someone with the obsession. Normally, in Los Angeles, you find pizza at a pizza shop but in New York, you could find pizza everywhere. Markets, delis or anywhere they sell food. We came into The Bread Factory Cafe...and I was expecting to see lots of bread. I didn't notice much bread but I did see the pizza. Actually, they sold all types of different food but the pizza was calling our names. The problem with this delicious pizza was it was cold. When I say cold, I mean it was warm on the outside and cold in the middle. I also ordered a garlic knot which was also cold. Call me crazy but I like hot food! I was hungry and wanted to eat immediately but I wanted my pizza hot!  The white pizza with ricotta cheese was almost perfect...perfectly cold. But get ready for this...I asked the man behind the counter to reheat our pizza. I had already taken a few bites out of my pizza and he put my pizza straight in the oven with no pan or paper underneath it. He did this with the garlic knot too. It's not like I'm worried about my germs, I'm more concerned with all the other people he did this with. He contaminated the whole oven. I don't want to have anybody else's saliva on my pizza. Do you think this is hygienic? What is their health code rating? Is this the norm? Literally, all my saliva went straight on to the next pizza and other food he put in the oven. This oven isn't killing any germs from the high temperature since my pizza still came back lukewarm. Believe it or not, their saving grace was the cookies. They're soft and moist just like a cookie should be. Even their Rice Krispie treats were soft. I would consider going back but probably just for foods that are packaged. If I'm hungry enough I might try the pizza again...The Bread Factory Cafe is in a tourist area of Manhattan so prices are on the higher side but normal for NYC. They have room for improvement but overly not a bad choice."

I ordered THE most flavorless Koba bowl, they use absolute 0 seasoning and even forgot sauce which I clearly put on the card. I paid $20 for a disgusting bowl that tasted like watered down rice and vegetables. Seeing as I was on break I couldn't go back to have it fixed and ultimately had to throw $20 in the trash it was that bad. Very upset and dissatisfied with the koba bowl, oh and to top things off I get a service industry discount which the cashier never applied."

What drew us in were the adorable animal shaped breads they had sitting in the window. Marketing on point. You walk in and are instantly drawn to the cases of delicious looking desserts. Naturally, I had to get a coffee and some macarons. For 2 macarons and a medium coffee, it came it $7, which isn't too bad. The macarons were absolutely delicious, and chewy. I make macarons all the time, so these get a 9/10 for me, the frosting needed some more flavoring. The coffee was good, but had a strange after taste, not sure why. All in all though, I wouldn't mind stopping in again if I'm by Penn station."

We walked in for lunch early afternoon on a Saturday and was seated right away (it was kind of empty but I'm sure it has their regulars during happy hours and at night). They gave us complimentary chips and salsa (the salsa was delicious) and we ordered a side of guacamole to start (also delicious). I ordered chicken soup and a chicken chimichanga with a pomegranate margarita and he ordered chicken flautas, a chicken quesadilla, and a piña colada (hold the rum, add the henny).

Also, no wait for your next drink, so...We've had some food items and usually order their fun and colourful and HUGE margherita drinks. They have one (I forget the name) that comes with a Mexican lollipop in it that is soooo good. I love it and the lillipop has an interesting flavour that's making me salivate just writing about it. They're located five minutes from my home and across from  Van Cortlandt Park so it's easy to just stop by on any given day.

Unfortunately on a recent visit we were all but forgotten about by our server. We had to ask for more drinks, refills on water, our check, and for them to run our credit card at the end. And the restaurant was less than half full. The food is delicious here, and perhaps the server was just having an off night - but I'd say overall come here for the food not the service. Normally the guacamole is decent - they make it tableside. But the other night it was... Off. I'm not sure how, it didn't taste bad but it didn't taste like guacamole. Girl this place is decent enough, but with the proliferation of cheap Mexican in the area, you'd be better served by a little hole in the wall taqueria."

Service was fast since the cookie was just sitting there on the counter on display but unfortunately, they couldn't reheat the cookie for me (won't hold that against them). Overall, the cookie was a big letdown. It was a hefty cookie for sure, but the texture and taste were both a little bit off. In particular, the taste seemed a little artificial and the sweetness had a strange aftertaste. It also left a strange coating in my mouth after I ate it. I do not think it is worth the price, and I do honestly feel some grocery store cookies are better than this.

I've had their coffee before and it is solid. Return recently to try it again as well as their cookie.The chocolate chip cookie does a really good job of blending a multitude of textures together. It is crumbly, crisp, gooey, sweet and chocolatey without being overpowering, and a little under done in the middle so that you get the soft interior that is surrounded by crisp, crunchy exterior I can see why this cookie gets a lot of attention. is it better than other iconic cookies of NYC? I think that it is probably better balanced and not as overly sweet or heavy, and would be my preferred cookie compared to the larger denser sweeter varieties out there like Levain or Chip"

They kept messing up our orders, the food takes forever to come out, the place looks run down and dirty, and we would get constantly ignored. Several times we had to end up servicing ourselves by just getting up and grabbing what we needed. I would never come back here even if you paid me."
2164,adpldzX9R1GEBwPht9PL8w,12/27/2021,5 star rating,"Amazed at how delicious this place was. Highly Recommended by my foodie uncle who is known to be a fantastic food critic. He alerted me of their amazing deals but we came at Christmas where there was no deals. However, the price is still cheaper than places in Brooklyn. We ordered a dungeness crab, lobster , stir fry seafood, and seafood fish maw soup. Yes, we love seafood. Everything was fresh and flavorful. I have to agree with my uncle that this must be one of the best Chinese restaurant in the city. They also have awesome dim sum specials where small, medium, big size is one price. This is definitely worth an hour drive to experience authentic Chinese cuisine."
2165,adpldzX9R1GEBwPht9PL8w,1/8/2022,3 star rating,"East has finally reopened the main dining room upstairs after a long renovation. Once again, they are serving dim sum. Dim sum dishes size S, M, L are the same price M-F.  Good variety of dishes. Unfortunately, they no longer have stations such as fresh vegetables which you can have made to order. You have to wait for it to arrive on the pushcarts or order it. Overall, the dim sum was ok.  You can't beat the price and they have a no tip policy.  As far as checking vaccination cards, they were rather lax.On the other hand, I would give the BBQ meats (roast pig and bbq pork are our favorites) and the lunch dishes downstairs in the carts 4 stars. The BBQ or Roast meat with rice dishes are a good value. It is my go to place when I want take out for my family."

2170,adpldzX9R1GEBwPht9PL8w,10/3/2021,4 star rating,This restaurant gets pretty busy so get there early or you might have to wait! The cold jellyfish appetizer was good and the shrimp and walnuts was cooked well. The candied walnuts were nice and sweet too. The minced scallop fried rice could have used a little bit more salt or flavor but still good. The beef with bitter melon had a good flavor but the melon was a little too bitter for me. Service started to get a little slow once it got busy which is as expected but wasn't too bad.

The first floor serves takeout barbecue meat and takeout dishes, but there's also a dining area inside which serves ""executive lunch"" as they call it, at $13, which is super affordable. A dish, an abalone soup and rice. The second floor serves dim sum in carts. I had never been here before the pandemic so I don't know what it looked like, but it seems that they did some renovations (not a full one I can tell) and it's spacious and nice. They probably have wedding banquets too, from their decorations. Dim sum is dirt cheap here and the quality is okay. For S-M-L, they're all the same price. They specify there is no need to tip. I have no idea why they say this and I feel bad if I don't tip (especially these days), so I still do, and the workers appreciate it. There is free parking for one hour for checks of $30+.The bathroom was really dirty the couple times I went. Wish they would clean them more frequently."

I have gone twice now (just in case I caught them on an iffy day the first time), but both times left me feeling meh. I am an ice cream LOVER. Ice cream is what keeps me going in life. I was so excited to stop here to finish off the meal I just had withy favorite dessert, but alas, underwhelming each time. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but it's certainly not up there with the best I've had. Notably, both times my ice cream had this weird underlying minty flavor. I got completely different flavors each time, so now I'm thinking maybe it's some kind of cleaning solution they use for the scoopers? I don't know but either was I was not feeling it.Also, the second time I went, someone who appeared to be the manager was visibly and audibly scolding one of the employees in front of customers because the sundaes he made didn't look good enough. It was very off putting, as he definitely could have handled the situation much better with customers being in the store."

My fiancé had the raspberry which was a tad for my liking but she loved it including the whip cream which was creamy and just perfect tasting. I had the coffee ice cream and boy was it good, its like having a fine Colombian cup of coffee that's frozen! Would mega highly must go to this place! Bumped into the owner and he is an amazing guy and hard worker along with his wife, just great down to earth people and their service alone is worth visiting this place!The decor is like they opened the shop back in the 1930's and held the decor hostage!

The guy who took our order was pretty rude and impatient. Wasn't a fan of him. Our drinks came out pretty quickly. The vanilla latte was way overly sweet. You couldn't taste coffee at all. The desserts look tasty though.
2257,C69uTzoWFaIWcpnYf2LbRw,9/17/2020,4 star rating,"COVID-19 review: the conference rooms in our old office were so poorly soundproofed that my boss and I used to come to One Girl all the time for meetings. And we'd always bring a box of tea cookies back to the office. This was also the office spot for cupcakes: they're perfectly sized with just the right amount of frosting. We were back down by the office (first time since March!) so made a nostalgic stop this afternoon to get coffee - the cafe is closed to customers, but they are operating as a takeout window and serving some of their sweets, including all my favorite tea cookies (get the Lucia and the Penelope). They're just the perfect tiny treat, and not too sweet. Definitely my favorite thing here. In addition to the tea cookies and the cupcakes, I've also had the lemon bars, the whoopie pies, and the crumb cake: all very good, but substantially more decadent."
2258,C69uTzoWFaIWcpnYf2LbRw,9/23/2017,3 star rating,"Had the opportunity to visit this place after stopping at Sunday in Brooklyn. This was not a destination, we just happened to see it when we were going to take photos of the bridges and did a drive by and ran in to check it out. The place was nice, and the selection was good for drinks but since I don't drink coffee and it was too hot for other hot beverages I passed on this. I once again wanted something quick to try, so I settled on the tea cookies which they had a variety of selections and they looked adorable on the trays. I chose the minimum of 4 (75cents each with a minimum of 4 for a total of $3 purchase)The thing that turned me off at this place was the cashier who seemed somewhat annoyed with the number of customers. I am a huge foodie and this was my first time in NYC so for my Instagram, twitter, Facebook, Snapchat and Yelp followers I do tend to take lots of photos so I can post them. When paying for my purchase the cashier was quick to say she did not want to be in my photo and I quickly let her know I didn't want her in my photos either so that was not even an issue. I don't know if the girl had warrants or something but her rude assumption I wanted to take pictures of her turned me off. The cookies weren't that great and this was $3 I could have saved, especially with the hearty helping of narcissism the cashier displayed. But if you live in the area and don't have to deal with the egotism when you go and the food and beverages are good to you, then keep the place open. Luckily I was only visiting from Chicago but I definitely know I won't be back the next time I visit NYC."

Great for a mid-day pick-me-up, or for coffee, tea, and even cider and hot chocolate in the winter.Their namesake cookies are tiny (and 75 cents each with a minimum order of 4), but good for a snack. Buy 4 and share with a friend. The hazelnut chocolate chip was my favorite. The pistachio was also yum.Will definitely come back next time I need a sugar high!"

My favorite item is hands down the whoopie pie - both chocolate and pumpkin are great! I think I even prefer the pumpkin one (and I'm not a pumpkin spice fan) I also like their lemon bar!The coffee/tea menu is not too big but ask if they have the item you crave. I asked if they had matcha and they don't, but I also asked if they have chai latte (which wasn't on the menu) and they do have it! They also offer tea cookies 4 for $3 or $3.5 but they are really tiny. Also their cupcakes look good. I suggest this time of year (fall-winter) for cute themed ones! Killer pumpkin whoopie pie - highly recommend"

Tables were very close to each other but was separated by what looks like thinner plastic than a  "" clear shower curtain"" .  Felt claustrophobic.   They could have taken out some tables.Escargot : one of the best escargot I had . Each compartment had 2-. 3 pieces of very tender and flavorful escargot soaked in fragrant evoo, parsley and garlic.  My only complaint is the over toasted bread that seems to be a day old . It wasn't even crispy, but plainly hard.Soupe l' oignon - top was amazing , soup was a little brothy, very thin broth. Won't get it again.Terrine de fois grasWas amazing. Salad was generous, and the fois gras was a big piece.  Melts in your mouth. Again, the toast were extremely hard.Kind of kills the fun of eating it."

We had not been by for some time, due to you-know-what, and were pleased to see that it had prevailed, when so many good restaurants went under.I prevailed upon my partner to have a meal there, and we were not disappointed in the least.  The food was excellent, beginning with wonderful escargot and a beautiful salade de betteraves (beet salad with goat cheese), accompanied by warm baguette.On to the entree; fantastic grilled salmon on a bed of mashed potato, garnished with fresh orange slices, and a superb steak frites, a most ample and delicious portion, with a fresh side salad.While we did forgo dessert and wine on this occasion, we were thoroughly satiated with this terrific repast, and will certainly return again in the future.  Highly recommended, reasonably priced, compared to many restaurants in our vicinity here on the UES, and with attentive and pleasant service.We look forward to our next visit!!"
2267,o-obS-OEbXSrdIdLqPYzXw,3/21/2020,5 star rating,"This place is exactly what you would expect and want from a classically French cuisine trained chef and his staff!Absolutely nothing was amiss and my dinner partners and I felt like we had walked in from a non-descript street into a small bustling French spot right off the streets of somewhere in Paris or south of France. We were wise to reserve our table online earlier that day and so thankful we did because the host was turning away diners at the door. Space is small but the wait staff and their long time patrons seemed to know the delicate dance to get around the many tables, chairs and bodies so we also followed suit. Once sat, our server quickly came over and greeted us.Everything, even down to the basket of warm crusty bread, was phenomenal. Their Foie Gras was so amazing that we had to order it twice, as well as the escargot. Ended the evening with creme caramel and we all cannot wait to be back here very soon!!"

2270,o-obS-OEbXSrdIdLqPYzXw,3/22/2021,3 star rating,"I read about the 5-star reviews and had to try Deux Amis for myself! We came on a weeknight and were seated right away. There were plastic covers hanging from the ceiling in between each table. Service was quick and well-coordinated. Food was underwhelming. The dinner menu was abbreviated (perhaps due to COVID). There were only 5 options and they all seemed bland and American, such as steak with potatoes. We caught a glimpse of their old dinner menu as it was hidden behind the ""new menu"". Many of the options sounded delicious, but our waitress told us they were not being offered currently. We stuck to appetizers as they were more French.Escargot - Cooked in EVOO and pesto. Came with a side of bread, which I thought was toasted too much. The bread was rock hard - I thought my teeth would chip! Foie gras - This was delicious. Creamy and served with fresh garden salad. 5/5!French onion soup - Tastes just like the French onion soup I've had in the past, made out of Julia Child's recipe book."
2271,o-obS-OEbXSrdIdLqPYzXw,11/11/2022,4 star rating,The place is a gem when not crowded but when it is you sit on top of others.  The food and service top notch. But if your looking for private or romantic it may not got well when they seat a single diner next to you who belched the entire time as well as coughed.  Also treated the place as an office with the light of his Ipad.

My favorite was the beef stroganoff, especially the mushroom flavor together with the beef and barley. The portion of the food was quite big, especially if you are ordering salad because most of the salad has beet and potato. The server was very friendly and he introduced every dishes to us. The decoration was like Victorian style, with a lot of old cabines and pictures. Recommend this place for those who are willing to try something exotic."
2273,j1lE04LqafT-t42AxhC-MQ,11/23/2021,4 star rating,"For Saturday dinner my party of 5 arrived at Mari Vanna, intrigued by the prospect of Russian cuisine. Immediately upon entry, I noticed the level of detail of the decor. Not only did it exude old world charm, with chandeliers and lace curtains everywhere, the walls, with gratuitous writing from patrons past, created a sense of uniqueness not easily replicated to other establishments.The party started with an appetizer - the Veal Pelmeni ($20). The small dumplings possessed firm yet chewy textures, with just enough bite to validate the menu's claim of handmade dumplings. The veal filling came with an abundance of juices as well. The dill and sour cream provided light flavor contrasts, but did not fight the dumpling for control of the palate.I ordered (for myself) the Beef Stroganoff ($30). It arrived in its own skillet, containing fillet mignon, mushrooms, and onions in a creamy mustard sauce with buckwheat. Admittedly, I did not directly taste the mustard, as the creaminess of sauce, intermingled with the savory mushrooms and beef, drowned out other flavors in a deluge of savory comfort. The buckwheat, prepared w/minimal seasoning, helped temper the assault of richness. Lastly, the party ordered two portions of Russian honey cake ($14) to share. Each portion had 2 slices, totaling 4 slices. The layers of caked crumbled, but with the texture of soaked biscuit rather than cake mix - fitting, considering that the layers constituted biscuits soaked with honey. That provided a much richer and denser flavor than cake could create. The cream, a bit sweet and a touch sour (a la sour cream), provided flavor contrast."

The bread wasn't fresh at all it was cold out from fridge. Cold bread not even warmed in oven before serving?At the end we asked to slip a check because we have a big group of people he refused us.Don't recommend. Never come again."

We were a table of 4, and whilst the restaurant was completely packed, the service was not bad and the food was great! One of my favourite parts of the evening had to be the infused vodka; we tried the horseradish -- my favourite, the cranberry as well as the fig. The ambiance of the restaurant was designed to mimic that of a Russian grandmother's home and I think they did a great job at this! The dysfunctional yet warm and colourful decor and attention to detail in this regard throughout the whole establishment was a nice touch. We shared several appetizers and mains; some of my favourites were the 'herring under a fur coat salad', the chicken tapaka (this was so good!!!) beef stroganoff, ajarski style cheese pie (this doesn't look like much but it was also very good) and the pirozhki. Everything is quite rich, heavy and creamy so I was pleasantly surprised to love everything as much as I did. Prices are not cheap, but it is an experience that I was happy to try and encourage everyone to try at least once! Not sure if it was the company or the infused vodka, but we did close the restaurant (as exemplified by the empty restaurant we left behind uin the photo)Overall: 4.5Food: 4.5Service: 4Value: 4Ambiance: 4.5"

I came here to grab dinner with 3 friends on a Tuesday night and we got seated outside without any wait but they were quite busy. I got so excited when I saw they have mushroom soup with porcini mushrooms which I loooove. I ordered it with no hesitation lol. I also got grilled veggies and Pirozhki with cheese. Everything was amazing! I absolutely loved the soup and am getting hungry just thinking about it now lol. We also shared two cakes for dessert and both were delicious (unfortunately I don't remember the names). On top of that, everything was served on very pretty dishes with floral prints which made the whole dining experience feel more homey. Highly recommend!"

While we relied on the Russians in our group to order, I enjoyed everything that was put on the table. The food was rich, well priced, and came out quickly. The drinks were strong and tasted good. The only complaint I have is that this random girl (not staff) from the bar kept coming to our table and we clearly were just being polite and didn't want to talk to her but the staff did nothing and didn't kick her out despite multiple tables having this incident with her. However I know that isn't a common occurrence."

I've come here a few times and this time it was one of my favorites. I was in a bit of a rush that night but my bestfriend definitely enjoyed herself and her food! First time trying their one of their signature drinkers and their chicken breast plate. Their chicken breast plate was the best chicken breast I've ever had! Instead of a cutlet or two I got a whole breast! It was cooked to perfection along with the veggies! I tried my bestfriends steak nachos without jalapeños and wow!!!! It was the best steak nachos I've ever had as well! I tried their Tres Leches dessert and it was good but a bit too sweet! We sat by the bar which wasn't so bad cause we got to hear each other speak (the music is very loud there) but we kept getting hit by the wind and it was 40degree so I wouldn't suggest to dress down if you're gonna sit by the bar in the winter lol There is a small parking lot near the restaurant as well which comes in pretty hand because parking isn't that great in that area.

When I got to the register and told the cashier what I ordered, she said you need to bring the prepared food because she doesn't know the price. I had to wait for the food and wait again in the long queue. This is not efficient and not something I want to do when trying to get to work in the morning. I recommend they give you a slip after you order so you can pay while you wait for the food"
2296,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,2/28/2020,1 star rating,Quite possibly the worst deli in the area.  The soups are never good...always too salty and always taste like no care at all was given to how it was prepped.  Ditto for the breakfast sandwiches.  The front cashier lady is as about as pleasant as an MTA worker during rush hour...what a grouch.  The deli workers are slooooooooooooow....I TRIED to like this deli.  I have gone back a few times hoping it would be different if perhaps they saw I was a regular.  Nope. Still shitty.  What led to this review was the Manhattan clam chowder I got today...it literally tastes canned.  I'm done.  I will never return to this dump.

I searched it up on seamless and chose this place because it was literally within a 1 minute walk from the office(but I still got delivery). I got the deluxe pancake for around $8 and it came with very mediocre(and maybe not even good) pancakes but it was topped by eggs(I ordered scrambled but they gave me an omelette, I didn't care but should mention), crispy pork bacon, sausage patty, ham, and buttered toast with loads of butter and syrup on the side. Most places makes you choose your meat but this place gives you all 3 by default. I'm not a big eater but it's pleasant to see a mountain of food for such a price. All of it was pretty good besides the main focus of the order, the pancakes. I hope they improve their pancakes. No complaints about the rest. The free Irish cream coffee that came with it was pretty good also, although I've been told I have bad taste in coffee by my connoisseur pal but he literally farms coffee beans in Guatemala and I'm only a commoner, I'm not on that level. The delivery also arrived in 15minutes, yes we were only separated by a single street but that's still good by my book. Will probably be going back often since I work so close and bad pancakes is similar to bad pizza. I'll still eat it."

Not sure what the exact issue was, it wasn't like the woman  was annoyed or asked me to leave.. Anyway, llueva month later I walked in there in the early afternoon and as a soon as she saw me she starts to yell at me to go do my drinking someplace else, and yells for Mike, the other bartender, a friend of mind, sweetheart of a guy, but I was so startled that I just left. I was so embarrassed. The bouncer isn't a bad guy but he has taken her word over mine. The other  night I tried to walk in there, 2 years after the ordeal and he still won't let me in ?? It's insane.

Super Bowl weekend ... watching the game ... half time and the show comes on. As soon as the play stops the bar tender turns off the sound and puts on some crappy 1970's music.Two ladies in their 50s / 60s were at the bar and clearly wanted to watch the show. When the guy turns off the audio they ask the Bar man if he can turn it in. NO was the reply ... they thought he was joking so asked a few other patrons if he was serious. They ask again... NO and then thing got worse. He says if you want to Watch Justin Timberlake go somewhere else ... and a few other choice words The ladies were shocked and cashed out not leaving a particularly big tip ... understandably Well then the guy unloads in them. I have NEVER heard a man speak so poorly to a woman before let alone a customer. I was so shocked I couldn't believe it. So with that I left too. The guy was nice to me... but just a complete jerk to these ladies and the girls and the way he spoke to them was just totally out of order So with that I hope you understand the reason for my 1 star review which is 1 Star more than deserved

The soup only comes with tofu and scallions. They do not add the wakami, which is common in Miso soup.I ordered a Libra roll from Sushi Fussion about a year ago. Well oh boy have things changed!

The spicy tomato daal base with lemon grass shoots, chunks of shrimp and chicken disappeared in no time despite being family sized. Probably one of my top 5 soups ever! We also ordered a side of chicken lollipop that tasted better than the last time I came. Not super battered, crunchy, although I feel like it could use more flavor. I like to use dipping sauces as a compliment to the flavors in the chicken rather than necessary for taste. Otherwise staff is exceptional and food is great"

She's busy which made the wait time up, but good and well-meaning.My problem is that there seems to be a grand total of ONE item on the menu that could pass as a vegetarian entree.When I asked the waitress about their vegetarian entrees she stares at me blankly and rattled on about chicken, beef, and goat. I felt like I was the first person to ever ask that question in this restaurant. So I got the vegetable curry with some nan bread.The man bread was ok. The vegetable curry was also ok. The latter consisted of a few pieces of cauliflower, potato, and string beans. And the way it felt so hot temperature-wise, and dry, I suspect it was in the microwave.  Mine cost $7.00.My father is not a vegetarian, so he samples done of their lunch specials (goat) which cost $12.00. I thought that was significantly too much for food of this scale and quality, especially food which we suspected to be microwaved. I don't think he found it to be worth it.On the way out we saw someone with a big fish platter and my father decided that's what he should have ordered.Overall, service is nice and well meaning, food is overpriced and mediocre, and lacks sufficient vegetarian options. I wont be back. 2.5 stars is generous."
2327,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,10/4/2013,3 star rating,New dine in/take out Indian restaurant on 37th Avenue.  Took the spot of the Chinese takeout joint.They did a great job with renovations and place so far seems very clean and aesthetically pleasing.I attempted to order the Fish Curry but was disappointed to find that they were out.  I went with the Chicken curry which was good but I was hoping for a little more of a portion.  The rice was a dollar extra but you get a ton of it.I'm sure I will be back since it is right around the corner.
2328,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,4/11/2018,1 star rating,I don't know why everyone speaks highly of this place. I've already seen rats twice there for the two times I've been there. Imagine using the bathroom and a rat just comes by your feet. I ordered the sizzling plate which is waaay too sweet. The samosas were soggy and their Thai soup is just nasty.
2329,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,12/20/2017,3 star rating,"The food is fairly good,it looks authentic and a few of the dishes are really spicy. I love their chicken samosas,large and spicy and a steal at 1.50$.  Had some of the goat curry and I think a lamb dish. Fairly tasty.  The only disappointing thing is the service in general. They can be slow and a bit of what I call third world mentality in terms of customer service.  I say that,coming from the third world,where the customer isnt right and it seems getting a smile or politeness is like going to the dentist. Possibly they are under staffed,but I can't say I feel welcome there,for whatever reason.   The food is spicy and seems authentic,it is fairly small and a hole in the wall feel,but a little nicer...try it for the food"

My only complaints are the fact they haven't gotten their delivery service on point yet! I'm not sure how much seamless or eat24 charge, but I need them to get with it before it gets, so cold that I refuse to walk there.Also their mango lassis are terriblefrown emoticonI didn't even realize it was possible to make a bad tasting mango lassi until this place. They are small, tasteless and way over priced. I get my food from here, but I walk to the restaurant on the corner and get my mango lassi."
2331,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,9/20/2017,5 star rating,"This place is actually really good, the downside is that it wasn't as good as it was a couple years ago. The food quality has gone down a bit but most of their dishes stay true to the authentic seasonings. Be WARNED, you really need a local/native (like many ethnic restaurants) order at this place. However, if you are able to get their chicken lollipop, I assure you it's one of the best in town. Very flavorful and well seasoned. If you come during their busy times, they are more or less fresh off the oil. There lamb Biryani and roast chicken are also delicious. There are few places in the city that can serve true authentic bengali cuisine."
2332,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,10/1/2018,5 star rating,"I've been coming here for a year now, as it is the most accessible on my way from the train to work. Overall, they have pretty good service. You can count on there being a line/huge crowd around the drink pick up area for both mobile orders and counter orders but that's to be expected given the location and area.I always mobile order and have never had an issue with the timing. Sometimes I have to say excuse me to actually get to the counter, but once there my drink is usually ready. There was a few times when i mobile ordered too early and i think someone took my drink, but the baristas did a great job with remaking my drink no questions asked once i was able to get their attention.I will say that one tip is even if there is no line, mobile order. They receive such a high volume of mobile orders that more staff are designated to those drinks. The only time i have ever had to wait a significant amount was when I ordered at the counter.I have to give them 5 stars because this morning, October 1st around 8:45AM, there was the usual crowd. I picked up my mobile order however through the music playing in my headphones I was able to hear this women GOING OFF on a barista. I did not get the context of what was wrong, but all I can say is there is nothing I can fathom a barista can do that would warrant the level of hostility this women was exhibiting, short of throwing scathing hot coffee on the customer and burning them (this was not the case). This women was screaming at this barista during rush hour and making her feel bad about her entire existence. I personally have never been screamed at at that capacity at my place at work and I am not sure if i have that I would have been able to handle it with the level of class this barista had. She kept her cool and refused to yell back, constantly offering her apologies and trying to deescalate the situation. This lady was relentless and I did not have time to stick around to see how the situation ended, but i have to top my hat off to that individual barista as well as the other baristas who continued business as usual attending to the other customers despite this distraction and keeping the grind going.I hope the manager or someone high up sees this, because this barista truly did an excellent job dealing with conflict management and deserves recognition for that. I am sorry she had to deal with that, and I hope her day got better."

No bathroom and only a few seats outside of the location. Not your typical Starbucks location. They might not have every food or sweets items like the other Starbucks location but they are pretty much stocked up on food and sweets. Very clean! Busy and crowded. I'm at this location almost everyday for two years now and everyone knows my name by now. They know I order through the mobile app. I use mobile app orders and my drinks always show up on time and correct. One or two times that the location is not open on time between 6-7AM and I ordered through the app. I'm like oh no... Next day, I spoke to them about what happened, they ask for my name and they fix up a up of coffee for me with no extra charge. One time I ordered through mobile app and I thought maybe I came to early to get my cup of coffee, I waited 15 mins. One of the barista noticed I'm waiting a long time and she asked, I told her my order and she made up a new one right away. I love the baristas there, they are very attentive to the customers unlike other locations I've been to. My office is surrounded by a few Starbucks cafes and for me, this location is the best for me!The espresso taste right and they filled my cup to the Max with ice."

Customizing your order won't make any difference since each person does their frap differently. Yesterday, I ordered a sandwich which was supposed to have bacon and chicken inside. When I got back to work to open it, I had ham, egg, and cheese inside a croissant. I already waited too long to get my order with only 1 person in front of me and my break was almost over so I guess I just had to deal with it.Edit: I'm still coming here since it's across from my work. I ordered a drink 15 minutes ahead of time. When I got there I still had to wait. 5 minutes in and I had to complain to see where my drink was. They forgot about it so I told them what I ordered. I even showed them my order on my phone. 5 minutes later they gave me a wrong order."

2376,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,12/6/2019,4 star rating,This place is very understated and does not feel corporate at all.  What it does do well is the coffee.  I had a latte and the barista knew what he was doing.  The one on University has a cozy feel almost like you are in someone's living room.  Nice place to grab a brew.
2377,_X8K1SI2ikAYgxbpB8lBiQ,11/15/2020,5 star rating,The best coffee and latte and espresso shop on university place! The staff is always kind and courteous and the almond milk lattes are perfect even without sugar. My go to place even during the pandemic. Recommend without a doubt!

Place is closet-sized, so don't go - they prefer that you order from grubhub/ doordash because they cater to them. Funny how they would cater to the hi fee services rather than the daily regulars?? Oh well, plenty of other options that welcome the customer"

2389,S2cWAHIk9SK9151Dosclqw,5/3/2022,1 star rating,"Stopping by here for lunch, we were sat quickly considering there were only a couple tables inside. Starting off with a few appetizers, the crispy spring rolls were great. Paired with lettuce and fish sauce, these were delicious. We also opted in for fried squid. Unfortunately, our server has forgotten to put this in but when we received it, it was just okay. Scored pieces of squid body, lightly battered and fried. For lunch, we all ordered the ""Big Bowl"" which consisted of brisket, tripe, tendon and eye of round pho. I found the broth to be severely weak and almost watered down. It did not have the richness of how pho broth ought to be and almost reminded me of a broth made from stock cubes and not beef bones. We did place an order for a few pork chops which I found quite tasty. The main reason for my low rating is the interaction I had with one of the staff members. I've asked how much the ""chè bà mau"" is in the cooler and the gentleman first replied with $5. He then proceeds to look at the menu and tells me $6. I asked how much it would be for three and that's when he decided to berate me. Quite rudely telling me ""It's on the menu and that it's all the same prices for everyone that walks in."" I'm not sure what was the reason for this scolding. I then asked for three to-go which he replied, ""just order it after your lunch and pay all together!"" I said, ""fine"" and sat back down. At the end of our meal, our check came and I was told they were having internet issues which they cannot process credit cards. I was asked to pay cash which is a bit of an annoyance considering I'm in Chinatown and wanted to utilize my cash for places which don't accept credit cards. The total bill came to roughly $96. From a not-so-great meal and to the behavior and attitude I received from a staff member, I would never return to this restaurant nor recommend it. In fact I was so upset with this experience, I took no photos and wanted to leave as soon as possible.

The cocktails were good and quite strong - I recommend the lavender gin. Apparently the rooftop is very cool too with lots of greenery.
2424,wO9FMvtYqsJoYrnHDASE0A,3/20/2018,3 star rating,"Fabulously hipster with super awesome herb/floral theme in the interior. This was one of our stops during a Brooklyn bar crawl. It's a pretty great dive bar wth floral/herb theme to their menu. Most every drink incorporates some kind of herb or floral accent. It makes it hard to tell if you're drinking alcohol or not ;) The inside is very dark, with vintage couches, a vintage-looking fire place and then vines along the ceiling with floral garland, etc. This is definitely a bar for a younger crowd since we felt like oldies in it, but the drinks were good. It was kind of loud in there though, so we couldn't really talk to each other."

Everyone's trying to stay afloat right now but it felt like a scam."
2426,wO9FMvtYqsJoYrnHDASE0A,6/10/2015,4 star rating,"Night of Joy may just be my new favorite bar in Williamsburg.The downstairs is this really cool, old-timey bar and lounge, with dim lighting and plenty of seats. Definitely a great location for a first date or a place to kick back with some friends. If you go to the back and upstairs, however, there's a really cute little outdoor patio with lights and plants. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a ""rooftop"" bar, but it's perfect for soaking up the last bit of sun during happy hour.And speaking of happy hour...Night of Joy does it well. Their signature cocktails with infused alcohol are only $6, whereas I'd expect similar drinks in Manhattan to go for at least $12. Just make sure you really like the flavors of the alcohol, as they're pretty strong. I enjoyed the orange blossom rum, whereas the lavender gin was way too potent and hard to drink.Happy hour ends at 8pm, so make sure to get there early, especially if you want to sit outside- the rooftop/patio fills up fast."
2427,wO9FMvtYqsJoYrnHDASE0A,11/6/2017,4 star rating,"Night of Joy is a cozy bar that's dimly lit and features an interesting decor full of antique looking furniture and lace curtains. Their downstairs area has a good amount of seating to hang out with a group or you can go chill by the bar and grab yourself a drink! Their menu featured a good amount of cocktails, but I mainly stuck with beer. They had a few on tap including a pretty good sour gose, which made me happy. The coolest part of the bar to me is the upstairs roof area. It's pretty spacious but feels up quickly. There's also a bar up there, but when we went it was cash only, so not exactly convenient when you want to use a credit card. Had a fun time here, but probably won't go out of my way to come back unless I happen to be in the area. In general I'd recommend it to others though!"

The rooftop is also pretty cool. There's always space for your group of friends and it's in a convenient location, which is why I probably end up here a lot despite everything else.However - there is a lot wrong with this spot. The drinks are super inconsistent. Some are incredibly boozy at one point, and then sometimes not at all. The bartenders are just straight rude. It took me like 20 minutes to get a drink because I kept getting ignored. And I'm used to this treatment in general, being a woman I usually get disrespected by female bartenders and objectified by others so, ok, fine, but still not cool either way. They don't really follow the whole 'first come, first served' thing here, even if you're as friendly as possible.Overall, not into it. Do better."

I was thoroughly surprised because the inside was so beautiful. They dim the lights a lot at night and there are candles and it sets a nice, chill ,even romantic kind of vintage-y environment. I personally loved it.There are places for you to sit at the bar, or in tables, or sofas. Usually the rooftop is really beautiful, but they had closed it because it was raining. The frozen margaritas are so delicious! My favorite is probably the mango. Lime is probably my least favorite. It was definitely on the pricier side, but definitely worth it because it's so big!"

If you get there early enough for the rooftop, definitely do it (though it closes early and seating might be hard to come by on summer weekends).The first floor is where the DJ and the dancing is. And most importantly, the cocktail bar. The cocktails were mostly a hit for me, though at least one miss. The basil gin gimlet is good. The rosemary and ginger bourbon too. There was one lavender drink that was pretty bad though. Way too sweet and kind of medicinal.Other than that, if the crowd dies down, you can sit in some funky vintage furniture and people watch. Or, you know, dance."

Sometimes, a man needs his fix!Ever since Char No 4 has shut its doors, I've been looking for a worthy alternative, and Travel Bar definitely fits the bill.Their whole theme is travel (duh). From the luggage-shaped sign out front, to the whiskey flights (groan) that they have available.Sure, it's a little out of the way (right next to Buttermilk Channel), but they advertise over 80 whiskeys!You can go on the low end, or the high end. They have it all (almost). Bartender was a cool guy and recommended the James E. Pepper for $5 a pop. Pretty tasty, especially at that price point.Myself, I went with a sazarac, which was equally as delicious.They also have charcuterie and some small plates here, though we were just killing time before dinner."

The menu is laid out differently than other sushi restaurants. The sushi sets are probably the best value to order from; however, they don't describe what the actual sushi is, which might be difficult to decide which to choose just by looking at the photos. We ended up choosing set B$32, all rolls. We waited over 45 min for our platter since it was very busy on a Friday night. They did give us complimentary edamame for our wait, but it tasted like the frozen edamame you can make from the grocery store. For the actual sushi, I didn't love the rice on the sushi - it was a bit mushy and tasteless which was why I rated it 2 stars. I also didn't like the fact they used paper plates, and one time use cups, forks, chopsticks, etc. Not very earth friendly. Probably wouldn't dine back since there's so many other sushi spots around.  The service was very nice though."

2446,6Z9Bo8cUMYdwe01llOy0gQ,4/3/2022,4 star rating,"I have dined in and ordered takeout from Komorebi before and had a pleasant experience with both.Their bento boxes are so worth it (under $10 during the times I went), the most inexpensive I've ever had. So far I have tried the chicken, salmon, and squid bento boxes (I think I like the chicken one the most), with the shrimp tempura because that's my absolute favorite! Be sure to visit during lunch hours if you want the more affordable options since the prices increase during dinnertime.I also tried one of the sushi combos with a friend and there was so much sushi we couldn't finish even though I felt like I ate a lot. I like the fried sushi rolls and the ones with eel in them (sorry I couldn't name them one by one but I attached a pic!). I didn't try the salmon but my friend said they were really good. I brought the rest home to share with my family. ^^I really really like their takoyaki, for some reason I particularly like the texture of their dough. I've never tasted anything quite like it before. But the only thing is I consider them a bit pricey as I have gotten takoyaki of pretty decent quality for cheaper prices. It was still nice trying them out at Komorebi, although I probably won't order them again the next time I go.But I'll definitely be returning for more good food in the future!"

Some one has texted me pictures of an updated menu since it wasn't available online. I wish they stated what rolls were in each platter but the staffed answer all my questions so it wasnt a big deal but i felt bad having to ask what was in each. The fish was nice and fresh and we loved the variety of the rolls. My son loved the chicken udon stir fry as well. Reasonable priced. We will definitely order again.

Very clean and timely and the staff are nice! Honestly the sushi platters are pretty worth it. Can feed 4 people on a platter and it's all well made. Rice to sashimi ratio is perfect and they don't skimp out on the fish. Their platter menus don't allow for customization so what you see is what you get-- unless maybe you have a certain allergy? Not sure-- I luckily don't have many allergies. I know it's super hard to find the menu online and every time I take the menu home I seem to lose it or have someone throw it out. So attached to this review is an HD menu for the time being. It's been last updated in July 2021. Thought I'd come out and support a small Asian business I loved with a small gesture lol. Enjoy the menu!"

2451,6Z9Bo8cUMYdwe01llOy0gQ,2/5/2020,5 star rating,"I love literally everything about this place. My only fear is that this restaurant won't stay for long because it's too good to be true! The concept is pretty revolutionary. It's basically a $10 ""cover fee"" that you pay per person that allows you to get access to their discounted prices that range from $1-$4, although most of the items are $1-$2. It gives you the feeling that it's an AYCE buffet but allows you to choose what you actually want to eat, rather than stuffing your face with everything on the menu. Quality was pretty good, definitely can't complain. They offered a $9 special of California Uni and it was so yummy. I normally don't prefer to eat Uni because it tends to be very fishy, but this wasn't at all. They had other great options for their daily special, like fatty toro and lobster sashimi so I highly recommend to check those out! I came with one other person and we ordered a decent amount of food, a few appetizers, two regular rolls, two special rolls and the Uni. Everything tasted very fresh and was presented quite nicely. They even include a free soup and salad with the $10 special. Service was incredible as well, but I'm not sure if it's because there were only a few customers in the restaurant. Our tea cups were constantly being refilled and the wait staff checked on us often. I was very impressed by how quickly the food came out as well. We received everything on the table in less than 10 minutes! Our bill came out to less than $50 for the both of us, and we left feeling pretty full. It was great to enjoy quality sushi for a low price, without hating myself afterwards for overeating. I will definitely be coming back!"

The staff is just weird. They seem extremely understaffed and just unaware of how to run a coffee shop or how to work with urgency. This was easily the slowest operation I've ever seen in a coffee shop.In any case, we really enjoyed our coffee and pastries! I would surely come back, maybe again on a lazy Sunday.

Thus, I was pleasantly surprised when I tried La Gioconda! It's been operating since 1993, and they specialize in classic Italian cuisine. La Gioconda offer lots of daily specials, so the entrees that we ordered that night were off-menu! AppetizerGamberetti Gigliati con Pancetta - Seared shrimp wrapped in Italian bacon over cannelini beans. EntreesRisotto - I try to get risotto whenever I can at restaurants because it's such a laborious dish to make. This dish was extremely creamy, and the rice was a bit mushy but had chewiness at the center. The abundance of sausage and mushrooms lent a subtle earthy and savory flavor. Squid Ink Pasta - There was an abundance of clams, almost a 50/50 ratio for seafood to noodles. The noodles themselves were thick, al dente and had a silky outer texture thanks to a copious amount of butter.DessertTiramisu - Honestly my favorite type of cake: Decadently soft and creamy, with a slight bitterness from cocoa and coffee powder.We came on a Friday night at 7 pm and thankfully had reservations, otherwise there would've been an hour long wait.

I counted 10 medium sized rigatoni on my plate.  My cousin loved the salmon.  Salmon is served with small fingerling potatoes   and spinach.  Nice sized portion.  I finished my meal nearly 10 minutes before her. Desserts are limited but they arrive quickly. Very small tables. If your like me and wish to stretch out a bit in a empty restaurant, owner will always move you to a smaller table for 2 even if you are the only couple in the restaurant. Immensely irritating.  One waiter on staff, very kind pleasant man. I visit this restaurant every time I'm in NYC for a few reasons: it's within walking distance to Grand Central Station, it's reasonably priced and it's my cousin's favorite restaurant."

We walked out and then decided to come back in. Ended up having a delicious meal with great service. We ordered a few appetizers. The special octopus was delicious and we also enjoyed the arugula salad. For kids they were quite accommodating - don't worry we'll make something. Both of my boys were happy with their meals. I ordered the branzino on the menu. It was cooked perfectly, was very yummy and was paired with tomatoes, spinach and potatoes. My husband had the lamb over risotto and loved it. Overall was a very nice, surprising experience and would recommend anyone going here."
2475,hh2T5aLJsSjpHvPRcQxIJw,8/14/2021,2 star rating,"Came by here for restaurant week recently with a group of friends and really fell short for me. The vibe of the place is a typical smaller New York Italian spot that has its cozy older vibe and isn't trying to be a fancy Italian spot. Given this, I like to think that the food takes priority but not so much. The staff was super nice, helpful in giving us recommendations for wine and the restaurant week menu. The owner (I think) was around and chatted with us which I always enjoy but he also told me that all of his recommendations for dinner would be off the restaurant week menu. That was very off putting and made it sound like they serve whatever just to get rid of it. The restaurant week menu included an appetizer, main and desert. A few of us swapped to try multiple things so I'll rate below. My overall impression was that the food was ok, nothing spectacular and some not good dishes.1. Meatballs - 3/5 - well seasoned and standard. A bit over cooked for my liking2. Calamari - 2/5 - very bland. The dish was lacking in flavors and complexity IMO. 3. Short rib risotto - 1/5 - mine came out so over salted it was a bit gross. I ate it to just not make a big deal about it but it was definitely over salted. Otherwise this dish would have been a 3 or 4 out of 5. I tried a friends risotto whose ended up being much less salty so just poor oversight and prep on their part. 4. Chicken bolognese - 4/5 - this was actually very good. Chicken was crispy, well seasoned/breaded in a delicious sauce. 5. Tiramisu- 4/5 - very good. Light textured and strong forward flavors.6. Panda cotta - 1/5 - I can't describe why me and the 4 other people at the table didn't like this. Texture? Flavor? Idk. My overall impression is that I had more things I disliked than liked and I'll pass next time."

2478,hh2T5aLJsSjpHvPRcQxIJw,9/12/2018,4 star rating,"Looking for an Italian place near our hotel and came across this place. La Gioconda small and intimate, maybe can sit 35 people in total. They have a decent sized wine list, although most are true Italian wines we had never heard of so we asked our server for a recommendation. The service was okay - our server seemed awarkward, not comfortable speaking at length about some of the menu items. Perhaps we was new. My husband got the lasagna - it was a decent sized portion but he said there wasn't enough meat mixture between the pasta so it was like he was just eating pasta and nothing else. I ordered the gnocchi and found the potato nuggets to be delightful. The sauce was a bit heavy on the tomatoes though - a bit more seasoning would have been nice as it felt very acidic. They closed at 10pm the night we went (Sunday) and they literally dimmed the lights at 9:50 to indicate they were closing. That felt a bit odd as it truly felt like they were trying to hurry us out."

We came in Saturday evening to meet some friends for dinner - fortunately for us, it wasn't too crowded, and we sat at a table in the corner for more privacy. We noticed La Gioconda is somewhat small, with around 15 tables, and dimly lit, making it a perfect restaurant for small parties and intimate conversations. By the time we rolled in, our friends already ordered a prosciutto plate for us to share. It was my first time having prosciutto, and it was quite delectable! The prosciutto wasn't too salty; rather it tasted quite fresh. The cheese tasted sharp, and I think the cheese and prosciutto complimented each other well. Our waitress was patient with us and let us take our time in deciding what we wanted as well as pleasantly answered any questions we had about the food choices. I wasn't feeling too hungry, so I ordered a plate of gnocchi. It came out very warm, so eating this gnocchi felt soothing. It was a little more firm than the gnocchi I am used to, but still like a soft potato cloud. The sauce was a light tomato sauce, and at first it was a little boring, but once I mixed the ricotta cheese into the sauce, everything tasted much better! La Gioconda is a great Italian restaurant perfect for small groups and modern Italian food. I would recommend this place to others!"

2481,V05D4jAQb3rT3WqEBGq-og,9/19/2012,4 star rating,This is a Chinese/ Guyanese and West Indian restaurant.It is now under new management and the new name is New Good Hope. It is part bar and part restaurant. The customers when we went were split between West Indian and Chinese customers. My hubby saw the chef and he was Cantonese and it reflects in the food. What we have observed is that Cantonese chefs who are from Guyana and India and other countries seem to cook better than those who have Chinese restaurants in Manhattan's China Town at least since 911. My hubby grew up in his family's restaurants cooking since he was 11 years old. When I say family I don't mean just parents I mean cousins and uncles and so on.This restaurant passes his test. I do not go out in NYC in the 5 boros for Chinese food very  often  since I get MUCH better at home. But I like the mix of cultures and this is Guyanese /Chinese food. It's real fusion not made up fusion so white bread Americans can think they are cool eating it! (most white bread Americans who do not know true Asian food think they are really cool when they go to fake fusion restaurants) Ask any white person from suburbia (if you are Asian) what their favorite cuisine is. They almost always say Thai. But they can't name anything other than Pad Thai. The reason  is they think it is exotic. But this truly is exotic.My hubby  speaks Cantonese and heard the chef speaking Cantonese so there are other Chinese cooks in the kitchen as well.I think this is worth a revisit if you didn't think it was good under the old ownership.I have come to love the roast lamb but I like roast lamb no matter what but traditional Cantonese do not use lamb in their dishes. dicionario.sensagent.com…The other dishes at this restaurant were cooked in classic Cantonese style. Worth a try for either Cantonese /Guynese or West Indian  or both.

It was very tasty, some of the food was spicy ( I love spicy food) The orange pepper sauce thing is on point. The pork is great, baby shrimp is great, I dont even know what anything I had is called but every thing was good. I prefer to order from here than to have regular chinese food."

I went in the afternoon, so there weren't many choices of bagels left, but I asked if they had onion, and they did! The onion bagel with lox spread was SO GOOD! Also really loved the cookies. I didn't try the chocolate muffin (that was for my partner), but she really likes the muffins from this place. I'm not sure what those cookies are called, but the base is perfectly crumbly, and the jam filling is sooo delicious. Not too sweet. I'd love to try other bagels from here in the future!

However, each bite after was more and more disappointing as we discovered new flavors. Not sure why I even bothered taking a to-go box; these were leftovers I was not looking forward to."

I came with a friend, and together we ordered the vegan lasagna and seasonal Khichari, a spiced lentil and rice bowl. The lasagna was super creamy and soft, with pesto sauce instead of red. The vegan mozzarella wasn't super overwhelming (i don't particularly enjoy vegan cheese), so this was amazing for me. I would definitely come back, and they gave me a coupon with the check for future delivery and pick up orders (order from their website). Great ambiance and service as well- music isn't too loud so you can carry on a conversation easily on a date night :) Amazing!"

I came with the girl for happy hour. Some good specials go on. They have cheaper drinks and there's also cheaper small bites as well. A lot of good choices to choose from. The whole menu is vegetarian, and most items can be made vegan. As for the appetizer we got the Sunflower Beet Hummus. It's $9 for a lot. This comes with celery, microgreens, orange, pitas, roasted carrot tahini, and sunflower seeds. A good starter, or that may be it if you're cheap. We are, and we were pretty satisfied. It has some pretty good sounding entrees. These of course are much more expensive but you get very good quality. Also they have vegan desserts. It has quite a few to choose from.

Overall, this place knows what their doing with their combos. Tuna was fresh and rice was well cooked. Plenty of seaweedy flavor and the garlic chips added a nice crunch.

Came here a few times for lunch and it is definitely one of my to go spots every week. this is not a ""do it yourself"" poke bowl. There is a menu, it is well thought out. Just pick one. Also, don't expect a kaisen don with super high quality fish on top of rice. It's not this kind of place.For the plus- Toro is on the menu and delicious- pricing is just right- the rice is really good, which is how this place stands out: slightly warm, medium grain, perfectly sticky- use of pickled onions or marinated cucumbers or shiso or scallions or Bonito flakes depending on the bowl is always the perfect mix of crunchiness, softness and spice- served quicklyFor the minus- it's not a comfortable sit down experience so don't come here with a party- miso soup is below standard average which is definitely something they can easily improve- Here the fish quality is good but because they chop the fish in small cubes, they can use more of the fish, unlike sashimi. Thus, it's not always the highest quality, which is not something that necessarily bothers me for a poke bowl under $20, with sauce and condiments, but worth mentioning."

I'm only talking about their baguette as this is all I tried along with an okay coffee.The baguette was similar to baguettes one buys from supermarkets. It was not crunchy on the outside. Inside was a doughy mess. Flavorless. As I chewed it felt as it were falling apart in my mouth. I had only taken a piece of the baguette - so I took the remaining almost full $4.00 baguette and threw it in the garbage. I thought about taking it home and toasting it to see if that would help but I was too disappointed.This is a basically a wholesale factory with a storefront.

The price was decent and the portion was reasonable as an artisan bakery. We love the Almond Croissant, the filling was creamy with crispy layers, it was amazingly delicious. The Babka wasn't our type, the walnut was off-balanced in proportion with the Babka itself in our opinion. The granola was also good, which was baked properly with plenty of different ingredients."

So far my favorite is their Black and White Cookie. The loaves of bread are excellent too. It's all good! I'm recommending if you visit NYC you stop in for a muffin, cookie, or croissant. You won't be disappointed."

I will say, I wish the staff was nicer. They were quite rude to us actually, I wouldn't come back here just because of that.

They decorative cakes as well as other breads and cake slices. The cakes are very pretty. The taste of most desserts is never overpoweringly sweet but flavorful enough to be good. The price is a little bit on the expensive side but I've never not purchased a fresh tasting item. I ordered three baked goods and we're all tasty. I appreciate that all baked good are separately package (clean). Price: the cakes are a bit on the pricy side for the size but I think the cost of whole cakes in general has risen over the years (par for the course).Service: the staff if friendly and helpful. The line can get pretty long but they can be swift at getting it down pretty quickly.Over good place for a quick dessert but not amazing.

It's a pretty recent addition and costs $2.49 individually bagged in plastic. I don't expect extreme authenticity from a bakery chain, just something good to eat. What I got was a slightly sour taste like the custard filling starting to spoil, and the pastry was not crispy crispy at all. The second is unfortunate but the first is inexcusable. Is it ok for a supermarket to sell spoiled milk? No, and I would give the supermarket a bad rating based on that spoiled milk, so I am giving this outlet 2 stars based on their Portuguese egg tart. Delivering fresh baked goods is what their business is about, and this was an epic fail!"

It was quite late (~6pm), but Paris Baguette still had a decent selection of sandwiches left, so kudos to that.My sister got the Provence Chicken Pesto Baguette and a box of 4 packaged macarons. - Provence Chicken Pesto Baguette - grilled chicken, topped with parmesan, fresh mozzarella, roasted bell pepper, pesto, and garnished with basil, on Paris' signature baguette- Macarons (box of 4) - Intense Chocolate, Vanilla Creme Brûlée, Pistachio, and RaspberryWe split the baguette and the macarons and both agreed that the macarons (which we had not planned on getting) tasted way better than the sandwich itself. The baguette was really dry and it seems like Paris skimps on the ingredients, as there was very little sandwich filling. The macarons, in comparison, were crisp on the outside, soft on the inside and so scrumptious. I wish you could pick and choose which flavors to get though instead of having the macarons pre-packaged ahead of time. The first three flavors tasted good, but I didn't enjoy the Raspberry one. They also have a box of 8, but again, you can't pick--it's pre-packaged."

I got the chicken Caesar baguette and soft cheese cake. The baguette was nice. The cheese cake wasn't really cheese cake as I expected, but rather Japanese cheese cake.

The place is a bakery so we also got a sample of cookies and they were delicious! My favorite were the chocolate chocolate chip (not a typo) and the red velvet chocolate chip.

Springbone Kitchen specializes in creations based on bone broth, which is often touted for its collagen-rich properties and overall nutritional benefit. While Springbone offers bone broth in its purest form, the restaurant also incorporates it creatively within a variety of entrees. Prices here are in line with other fast casual places in the city (an entree will run you anywhere from $12-$15). I opted for the Mexican Bowl and requested kimchi to be added on. My food was ready for me upon arrival and I was able to grab a seat within there small outdoor setup to enjoy my meal.Mexican Bowl (w/ Kimchi) - I honestly have no complaints about this dish. The Spanish rice in the dish is cooked with chicken bone broth, so it worked perfectly for me (as I do not eat beef). To be fair, I couldn't tell that this was made with bone broth; nevertheless it tasted wonderful and was well seasoned. The rice was fluffy and the kimchi and chili sauce added a kick which rounded off the flavors really nicely. Portion wise, I was more than satisfied; this meal took me from starving to full, yet I didn't feel bloated or overstuffed. I'm also happy that they included guac at no additional charge! It definitely added a creaminess to the bowl and rounded it off quite nicely.I genuinely can't find anywhere to fault this place. The food was prepared according to my specification and was ready on time. I'll definitely be coming back here to try the well-known Grandma's Chicken & Rice-perhaps I'll get a cup of bone broth as well!"

Want something healthyThen THIS is your place. I've tried 3 things from here and all amazing (but some more bang for your buck). I've come here to grab dinner on a few occasions and based on those experiences, am recapping my memory.1. Grandma's Chicken and Rice (10/10)- This was hearty, wholesome, and healthy. This truly tasted like something a grandma would make for their grandkids after school/dinner. It's clean (in the sense of not oily), and leaves you feeling perfect full.2. Beef Chili Bowl (11/10!!!)- HOLY CRAP. I don't eat chili often, but on a cold day, I was craving this. and BOY WILL I NEVER GET CHILI ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. Their chili was absolutely divine. It was decadent, thick, and put me in a food coma afterwards (in the best way possible). I didn't feel ""heavy"" or like I needed a run after to burn it off. One thing that I cannot stop thinking about though, was the sweet potatoes that it came with. Now, I don't know if I got lucky that this batch of roasted sweet potato, but they were out of this world. It was so sweet, I couldn't believe it. I tried to look really closely to see if there was sugar on it because it legit tasted like candy sweet potato. COME AND GET THIS (so that it can stay on the menu for the next time I visit NYC). Please and thanks.3. Chicken Zoodle Soup (8/10)- Sooooo this was great, but it is not a meal. More like a light snack. For the price, I would honestly have just gotten the chicken soup and then found myself some pasta of some sort to eat with it. But for the price of this, I'd DEFINITELY pay a few more bucks to get a bowl.Ugh, I love this place so much."

The grandma chicken bowl and soup are easily the most popular dishes here--orders for these things were flying out the door nonstop. Definitely get hot sauce on the side if it's not already part of your meal. It's delicious!Also, there is very limited indoor seating, so don't be surprised if there isn't much space to sit down--certainly not for large groups."

I usually get the California (romaine, tomatoes, chicken, egg, avocado, almonds, and balsamic vinaigrette) without the almonds. Instead I ask for cucumbers or some other vegetable. I guess I'm just not a big fan of having something super hard  and crunchy inside my salads  The last time I asked for this they kept the almonds and took out the avocado. THE AVOCAOD IS MY FAVORITE PART. I didn't realize until I got back to the office and couldn't find any avocado when digging through my salad. Once before that they completely didn't even do the substituoon and just gave me the California the way it is even though I clarified my substitution with them. It was even written on the paper slip that they fl ot when you first walk in. Also the workers seem to always joke around d behind the counter so that's probably why my order is more often wrong than right. I feel like no one listens and they have bad communication in moving your order around from person to person to fill it and chop it. Another time they called my name over to a station and I waited there after two others and wondered where my bowl was.  Turns out someone moved it to a different station and didn't even bother letting me know. Other than these annoying 'misunderstandings' or what have you, the vegeatnles are at least consistently fresh. I also love the idea that they offer reusable salad bowls to help reduce waste."

The ingredients are fresh, the dressings are plentiful and the price is comparable to other salad bars/stores I've been to. The thing that actually makes me keep coming back is the staff. There are two employees that stand out, Eronely and Fifi. They are always very welcoming and attentive. As a regular it feels good when the employees recognize and acknowledge you. On my first few initial visits I realized I was always greeted by them and other staff to take my order before I even knew what I wanted. It's like the minute I walk in a homing beacon goes off and someone is gravitationally pulled towards me (as it should be). Now I don't want to be the person who makes everyone behind them wait while I make up my mind, this is NYC after all, and everyone's in a rush so I've realized that I have to make a decision before I even enter the store, this is the level of their prompt service.In a Covid world I pay meticulous attention to everything and anyone preparing my food. The place is always clean and not once have I ever had an issue with a server preparing my bowl without wearing a mask correctly or not having gloves on. The employees always seem to be smiling behind their mask and very happen in their environment, to me that speaks volumes because as weird as it may sound, I do not want to have someone transferring any negative energy to my meals. Whenever people ask me when I get my salads from my answer is always this location."
2578,okF1w-7gZNy2OB73SsjuYw,9/19/2019,4 star rating,I was looking for something different to eat since I work in the area and decided to give this place a shot. Upon entering I was immediately greeted by a woman who made me feel very welcomed. I wasn't familiar with how it works so I was taking a bit longer then normal to order. The woman realized that which was cool to observe & offered to walk me through the process which was great because I wanted to create my own salad anyways. The ingredients in the station was clean & looked very presentable so thumbs up to that because it's impossible for me to eat something that doesn't look good. I guess it's true what they say' we eat with our eyes first ! Throughout the course of her making my salad I honestly felt that she was very genuine which made me feel that she cared about what she does. I noticed that passion when I walked through the door so I hope this company understands how blessed they're to have an employee like her as not too many people care to serve with a smile and courtesy now a days! She really went above and beyond for me and that's what made my experience great. Over and above that I was definitely going to need a drink to go with my salad and I peeped they make smoothies. I asked what she recommends and she asked if I was a fan of peanut butter & luckily she asked the right question because I sure am !! So I got the Peanut Butter Warrior & that sh*t was BOMB!! So best believe I'll be back for 2 of those smoothies next time! The woman who helped me was named YENNIFER & I recommend this place for anyone looking for a good salad and smoothie combination! Thanks !

The customer service here is terrible. I called three times to get transferred to the location I ordered from--to sort out a wrong order--and each time, as my call was being transferred, the line dropped. Chopt would never. The salad order I received, that was for someone completely different, didn't even look appetizing. If you are looking to be hungry and dissatisfied, I promise this is the place for you!"

Crispy on the outside, tender and flaky on the inside. You can tell it's real fish. Seasoning is perfect. Not too greasy. The sliders are good for sure, but the fish is what I come back for.

I have to say the reviews of the frozen ones tasting the same as the fresh ones is pretty accurate.

I love love the fried cheese that they have and wish I could order it separately.My favorite GoTo is the Cubano which is full of roasted shredded pork, pickles, cheese, ham in between two tostones. It's a huge portion but not an at all unmanageable! Be sure to add all the 3 sauces or at least try a bite with each. Such a guilty pleasure. The yucca fries are also delicious and can be order loaded with onions and green scallions for sharing!They have about 8 seats and 4 tables, and there's options to order via the Qr codes on the table. The employees are very sweet and authentic as well if you have any questions at all. 10/10 recommend!"

Plus fried plantains as the bread of a sandwich is genius. It was so tasty and enough to split with someone else. The sauces were also great additions to all the flavors and textures going on.This shop is small and cozy with friendly staff. We didn't have to wait long to get our order. I definitely wish I lived closer, so I could have this more often!"
2592,3Lj7gVcMG6hy9lv-4bdIBg,7/28/2022,2 star rating,I have always relied on their hearty and tasty portions. I ordered today for delivery and I couldn't believe how they downgraded the size of the standard patacón! It was 1/3 the size of the ones I used to order from here and their queens location! i guess times are hard but even the amount of beef included (also pretty tough meat this time around) left to be wanted. I also added avocado for extra love and they laughably included a sliver of it.

I ordered a BLaTin aka BLT with double smoked bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato and salsa verde sandwiched between two fried plantains. I love fried plantains, and never would thought it would make such  great sandwich buns. Each bite was flavorful, and tastefully built. Your hands will definitely get messy, but it is worth it.

While expensive, they were worth the price. I loved my mezcal drink. They had a good selection of beer too. I snagged the last Three's Pilsner. Wine was on point as well.For dinner we ordered a lot. Started off with the eggplant salads, which were fine. Then had summer rolls which hit the spot. The stars of the night were the pork belly buns and slow cooked lamb buns. We got three mains for the table. The Bourbon Battered Red Snapper, which was good to the last bite. The Flank Steak Hawker Noodles, were my favorite main. The Cumin Sesame Seed Marinated Chicken was solid, but my least favorite of the three. Overall we all left extremely stuffed and satisfied. I could not have asked for more. I'll be back for sure."

A popular spot for brunch, the ambience of this restaurant is quite unique. In the back room, you are transported into a world of rustic charm. Despite the service and ambience being A+ quality. The food is where it starts to lack. The steak is hard and rubber like, the pork is a lot better. And the other dishes don't come together as well as imagined. Still, it is a place that anyone looking for a nice Asian inspired cafe should visit!I would rate the place as 3.5, but to give it the benefit of rounding, will give it a 4!Happy exploring and happy eating~"
2602,rna3sL5hDMLP81vB_dzb2g,6/7/2022,4 star rating,"4.5 Portions were HUGE! I wouldn't get a dish for just myself because I could barely finish the entree dishes. As someone else previously mentioned, this place lives up to their name ""bricolage"" as a construction of a diverse range of available things. The decor certainly looks random, but everything goes well together. If you're looking for your standard Vietnamese food, don't expect that here. I believe it is Vietnamese-French fusion, so they do have a slightly different menu. I was a little disappointed by the crispy imperial rolls, which was so small for the pricing. I would rather get them at my local Vietnamese place than dish out the cash for the two small rolls that I got. The two main dishes made up for the rolls. The spicy garlic noodles were amazing! I tasted subtle hints of garlic and there was a surprise layer of bok choy hidden underneath the noodles, that just soaked up the flavor. The pork belly was also delicious, great distribution of fat with meat and melted in the mouth. Despite the delicious main courses, I'm not sure if I would be coming back. The patio seemed a little small and it is actually enclosed, so I felt a bit hot siting outdoors on a summer day."

Maybe they were having an off night?Ordered the lobster crepe. It was good/okay but didn't blow me away. Underwhelming is the right word. The bits of lobster were tender and well cooked but the flavors didn't knock my socks off. Didn't taste or see any corn which I was hoping to get bits of. Probably would try the papaya salad next time instead. Also ordered the beef pho. The broth was pretty lackluster compared to the also highly rated Vietnamese spots near my apartment. We sat outside and the pho immediately cooled off so perhaps that's why? Maybe it had to be hot to appreciate the flavors in the broth? I'm really reaching here guys. As for the carpaccio beef, the broth wasn't hot enough to cook it so it was super rubbery and I spit it into my napkin. So sad about this because I came in so excited to love Bricolage!As far as ambiance, it's gorgeous. They did a nice job with their outside tables. Heaters above almost every table and it's decorated beautifully. For service, the waiter looked tired. And a bit annoyed. Which I can appreciate as a long time bartender (I tip 20% no matter if the service sucks or not). We ordered the lobster crepe to start and 15 mins later dumplings showed up. No biggie, he put in the wrong app. Had to wait another 10+ mins for the correct lobster crepe to come. It happens.Another gripe I have is that my friend has been here several times and orders the pho to split. They said they could do it for us and when it came there was just another bowl. Did they expect us to use chopsticks to scoop up the broth? Maybe just a prep or kitchen error and forgot to give us a ladle.I feel bad because every restaurant has an off night so giving it 3 stars instead of 2 stars. But the food and the service were both off last night which doesn't give the best experience."

A more upscale version of the classic Vietnamese dishes I am use to having at smaller mom and pop places. Overall, the dishes were pretty tasty and they have some creative drinks.

Whenever I go yo a new thai resturant, I always rate according to their papaya salad and pad thai. From the two, I have to stay this spot is a 3/5. However, the kao soi with beef was what bumped them up a point. The beef was fall-off-the-bone tender and delicious."

It looks like a normal restaurant from the front but once you get in, they have their back of the house set up outdoors and kinda like a green house which was beautiful for a date night. Had so much flowers and had tables set up to sit and enjoy the natural light and candle lights at night. The waiters were very attentive and provided us with any details for any questions we had. As for the food - Amazing!! Would def recommend and would come again as well to try more. Below descriptions of the food:Kao Soi Short Ribs - mouthwatering! Too good to describe, but the best way to describe was filled with a lot of flavor and juice, good portion of fat that complimented the curry and noodles. The meat was soft on the inside and has a good crunch/crust on the outside - just perfection. Would highly recommend. Lamb Massamun - the curry and lamb were absolutely the best! Filled with flavor as well and did not disappoint with the quality of spices that made this dish so yummy. It was also served with a side of rice that was a perfect combo with the curry and meat. The only complaint was that the veggies were not soft. The onion was still a little raw and the carrots were not boiled or cooked all the way. Seemed more of a garnish than part of the dish but was still a very delicious meal. Roti - the roti was disappointing honestly. Felt like biting into sit and did not have much flavor as expected. It was not soft nor filing in my opinion. Would not order again, but have tried roti in other places to compare and say this was not up to my expectation."

The host was clearly overwhelmed, received inadequate training or i don't know, because he was not doing a good job at maintaining the wait list. My party of 2 arrived and he asked us how many (to which my partner, standing next to me, said 2), then asked if there was anyone else with him (???????). He told us to have a seat & he'd be with us in a moment. Thought that was odd bc he didn't take our name/number. Other people who were there before us were losing their patience, as he kept asking the same groups, every few minutes, how many people were in their party. One woman mentioned they were waiting for over 2 hours; that is asinine. He wasn't offering any explanation to anyone, just repeating ""give me a second.""He lead us to a table, to which I asked for a napkin to wipe the seat bc there were crumbs on it. He looked at me partner and asked him ""what does she want?"" My partner repeated my request, and he mumbled under his breath as he went to get a napkin. At this point, I told him I'd do it myself, as my patience was thinning by the second.My omelet was dry. On the menu it stated it came with sour cream and salsa, but did not receive it with my order. I got the waitress's attention to notify her of this, and she said ""you want salsa and sour cream?"" Um...yes I do. The container barely had any of both condiments. My partner said his pancakes were dry. At that point, we were over it, got the bill even before I finished my meal, paid it and left. Never again."

There is no waiting for a table in the restaurant to reduce the spread of  covid. You are notified by text when your table is ready. The employees are all masked up, gloves up and ready to serve. The assurance that they were taking the necessary precautions is appreciated. The food was what you'd expect at a classic chain restaurant. Huge portions, tasty and fairly inexpensive. I'm a crepe-er at heart so i had to get my fav. I also had the southwest chicken bowl( you can also get it as a burrito). Portioned right and flavorful. My husband had the Colorado omelette. He called it ""Man food"". Hearty, protein filled and filling. Pancakes are always a must at IHOP. Even though the wait times for food was a bit longer than usual, it was a great experience"

This has now become a semi-regular stop for me -- it's super clean, you can sit inside (they have outside seating in the back), the quinoa waffle is also bomb.

It can't be that every day at 7:30am all the staff is in a bad mood  I even asked the lady attending me if she was okay. It is very disappointing because this place has potential. However, if the staff continues with that type of attitude in the mornings, the business will slowly start losing customers. And also, I had to wait 20 minutes for one protein shake because the lady was still making coffee and setting up.

The food was cold, the portions were extremely small - it seemed as if someone had already eaten half of the meal. Additional what was left of the food was old and the salad was brown and spoiled. When my fiancé called them to try to get our order redelivered we were first told that there was nothing we could do and then we were yelled at and told that there is nothing wrong with their food no one ever complains and they hung up on us.

When I called to ask why this was like this the lady over the phone replied ""they're seasoned different"" I explained to her they taste exactly the same and she repeated ""they're seasoned different"" Last time I order from here if you're gonna rip people off with fake menu items over a dollar."
2683,rQp8ve1NiDted89b_sIq8g,4/3/2017,1 star rating,"FYI: I ordered from Forest Kebab House through Grubhub but received my order from Sumac so this review is for both restaurants.---Who the hell do the owner and cook think they're foolin'?This isn't Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, or Arabic food. This is garbage, plain and simple. For those of you who've eaten here or will eat here do not be fooled into thinking this is authentic food. Try any other Middle Eastern restaurant on the planet or even a friggin' food truck and you'll know what I'm talking about. It should be a crime to disguise brown sewage as Hummus. The staple of any Arabic restaurant, Hummus, and these fools can't even get it right. I ordered the Falafel Platter, Muhammara, 3-way Labneh, and Kunafa, which is a dessert. Anyone who knows Kunafa knows that it's an Arab cheese pastry with sweet syrup and pistachios, which is what it says on their menu. Google it and you'll see exactly what it should look like - like a thin slice of pie with a layer of cheese, pastry, and pistachios. Instead I got a shriveled string pastry, similar to Kunafa but in a circular shape with nuts not pistachios and no cheese. When I called, the order taker on the other line said, ""I don't know how Kunafa's supposed to look like but that's Kunafa. The cheese is made in the dough.""What!?!? Are you kidding me?Instead of 3-way Labneh, they sent Hummus. Fine. Let's try it. Brown water. Absolutely disgusting with the wrong consistency and no flavor. Next. Muhammara? Watered down red pepper. Not surprised. Now the Falafel, the main dish. I opened the container and found a pile of yellow rice with 4 pieces of burnt brown balls on top. Against my better judgement, I tried it. Yup. Dried-up turd. I dipped it into the tahini, hoping to drown this black rock with flavor. Think again, sucka! The tahini tasted like someone gargled with it then spit it back into the container. This place is a real disgrace. I was actually excited by the idea of having a restaurant with a decent Mediterranean menu nearby, but if you can't even get the staples right, it's time for you to close up shop and find another business. I grew up on Arabic food and, because of that, I'm personally offended and embarrassed by the slop they push as food. Dear Owner: be ashamed."

The service at Sumac is not.I STRONGLY advise that anyone looking to eat their food either eats at Sumac or picks it up themselves to take it home. Reason being is that Sumac does NOT have their own delivery driver. They are piggy-backing on another restaurant's delivery guy next door to them to use to make their deliveries. While this does not sound like a big deal, it seems like their orders are last in priority and get delivered extremely late & very cold.When I contact Sumac on this via telephone, they have a very non-answer response and keep telling me 10 minutes, 10 minutes etc. Meanwhile, they have no idea where the driver is because it is not their driver. And when the food arrives cold - they don't care to offer a credit or apology; nothing."

We stood in the doorway for at least 1/2 hour as the host took 3 or 4 takeout orders on the phone while we waited to be seated.

Waitress (Renata) rushed us to order, pointed to the sign that said no exchanges or refunds when I was mentioning (without wanting a refund or even exchange) that the drunken noodles were not cooked fully, made fried rice that was bland and clumped together, and when I asked to see the menu where they automatically add tip, they gave me a different menu. I believe they add automatically for parties of 5 or more. The waitress was beyond rude, and felt annoyed to be working there. This was my first and last visit. You can get better Thai food anywhere else. The bill for 6 was $180 and we didn't order appetizers or drinks."

It's situated on the Bay overlooking the bridge. We arrived just in time to see the sunset. 2. Strong cocktails: the Blue Margarita was strong and tasty. 3. Great food: the food was amazing. Very flavorful! While here you must try the Pineapple Fried Rice, or Pad Thai. Grows: 1. The pay as you go service: Upon entering you are told to order/ pay at the cash register and sit at your table until your number is called. Once your order is complete, you pick up your food and return to your table. Our food and drinks were served in plastic containers/ cups. The waiter didn't check up on us to see if we needed anything. I understand that restaurants are taking extra precautions in the wake of Covid, but this experience felt like expensive takeout. Overall, this restaurant is beautifully located and has great eats. I mean, eating by the water is always refreshing! However, I think they should reconsider the plastic containers and wait service so that it feels more like a restaurant experience."

A beautiful spot situated on the Rockaway bay at the foot of the cross bay bridge.  An amazing outdoor eating area for a gorgeous evening like it was tonight. Still in the midst of corona so eating outside only. This was a poor situation. You have to order your own drinks and food at the bar which was mostly closed in with plexiglass which is fine. It's pay as you go. You get a number and when called, you go pick up your food which is served in plastic disposable containers along with plastic cutlery. It feels like a cafeteria. I understand that they are using utmost caution but eating this way isn't worth the fairly high price of the food. Once outdoor dining was approved, I started going out a lot. All establishments had waitress service where gloves and masks were worn. One thing about my food - I ordered crunchy thin noodles with broccoli and pork. About 10 noodles were crunchy. The rest were not because they were drowned in the sauce it comes with.  Chicken wings were very good. Until the virus is over I won't go back here."

The flavor and the amount of white clam on the pizza should make it soggy but it isn't.  The Pizza is not your average pizza, fresh, crusty and of course I did check off ""well done"" on my order preference so if that's what you like make sure you do the same.  The garlic bread is so awesome that it never made it home, as my 11 yo wolfed it down on the ride home.  I would try them again and when I picked up the pizza I checked the interior space and it is more spacious than Juliana's and have better view too.  I would not over this hidden gem if you are in the area.  This review is done by a local Brooklynite and not a tourist so take it how you will!"

Until a line to enter the restaurant filled up that view. The entire two hours of our meal, we were on display, like in a zoo. Hungry onlookers were ogling us and our food, as we ate. Extremely uncomfortable. Zero enjoyment from being watched from the other side of glass. Huge detracting factor. Instead of the views, you're watching hangry faces of strangers ogling every inch of you and your food. Get here right upon opening, at noon, or prepare to wait outside in the freezing cold. The space is not big, and this being a touristy location, you'll wait a long time during peak dinning times. Service was harried. Probably understaffed.Got a large pizza--half clam special and half shrimp special. Clam special was completely bland and tasteless. Skip. As if the kitchen forgot to put anything besides the clams on this half of the pizza. The shrimp special was delicious--truly a highlight. Can't really imagine seafood on a pizza, but this combo worked well. Really delicate shrimp perfectly done oreganata style.Also got a medium white pizza with mushrooms and spinach. Tasty, delicate."
22,ynQ8NJB7SEAIkuUxopHPvA,9/10/2022,2 star rating,"Had lunch at Ignazio's on Saturday afternoon. A great location cannot make up for extremely poor service, inadequate cooling, and subpar pizza. Also, cash only for their higher prices is absurd.Quality: We ordered a Medium The Pizza and a Calzone With Prosciutto. We ended up with The Pizza With Prosciutto and no Calzone. After failing to flag someone down to fix the order we just ate what we were given. The pizza was okay, but not in the same league as its neighbors Juliana's and Grimaldi's. Not nearly enough cheese, too salty, which certainly wasn't helped by the prosciutto, and a texture that was too crunchy without any softness.  Quantity: A Medium Pizza was still quite big and enough for two to share.Value: $24-$30 for a Medium Pizza. $3.50-$4.50 for each Topping. Cash only.Ambiance: Ignazio's has prime real estate as the pizza spot under the Brooklyn Bridge. The restaurant looks out to the nearby park and sees tons of traffic. They have two sections of outdoor seating and then a fairly large indoor space. The indoor area does not have central A/C, so you will be relying on fans and portable units. There was also no music inside or out, which felt eerily silent.Crowd: Busy on Saturday afternoon, but seemed to be a lot of folks who were unwilling to wait for the neighboring pizza shops.Service: They got our order incorrect and were impossible to flag down and fix.Parking: One of the busiest areas in Brooklyn, street parking is a challenge."
23,ynQ8NJB7SEAIkuUxopHPvA,3/2/2023,1 star rating,"Consistently bad. I imagine the rent to be very high--though prices have gone up 25%-30%+ in the last 2 years, presumably to accommodate this along with inflation. Most recently, the size of the pizza has been cut by a 3rd in ADDITION to the skyrocketing price. But by far the worst thing is that they don't COOK the pizza. Occasionally it can be good. But most of the time, it's burnt both top and bottom, and there's visible raw dough in places where the pizza is not burned. Things work out poorly even after trying to cook the pizza at home post-arrival. They must be forced to move these pizzas as quickly as possible, and they can't keep them in the oven long enough at the temps necessary to actually cook them. I have to say avoid."

I ordered a handful of pizzas from Juliana, which is around the corner up the street, and to simply put it, they refused to make my order because they wanted to prioritize in-restaurant diners (You can read my negative review on their page to get more details). I had to order these pizzas for my daughter's 2 year old birthday party and when we got to Juliana's to pick them up and find out they refused to make it, I had to scramble. This is when Ignazio's saved the day. They were very understanding and prioritized my order to help me out and had the pizzas show up basically right in time to when I needed them. The vibe is just great here and they are the type of place where I sense that they still care about good customer service, which always makes things taste sweeter.

The workers are so nice.  I went here for winter 2022 restaurant week.  The butter lettuce salad was amazing.  Who knew such a simple dish can be that good ! The dressing is light and the breadcrumbs coats the lettuce leaves just enough to give a crunch. The roast chicken breast was delish but slightly dry. However, the crouton and veggie side they came with it prob soaked up the chicken au jus and that's the point I think. Pot de creme is a chocolate dish. Go for it.

It's not as spicy, but the food has flavor. There's lots of choices for vegans. Be prepared for how you're going to eat. It's one of those Ethiopian places where traditionally you eat with your hands. This saves them money on washing dishes, right? It has lots of vegetarian options. The food all comes on a platter. It's covered with a spongy injeera bread. This comes with a few rolls of the injeera. We had the Tofu Tibbets. It's about $15 and comes with some greens. This looked like it was spinach or something like that. As for the tibbets, they were good. These had a pretty spicy tomato sauce and the injeera helped soak it up, making it much easier to eat it. It was really good food. It gets busy even later at night. This is one of the few Ethiopian restaurants around here so if that's what you want try getting something from this."
41,tbg4gR3jUUllR28cySo2kg,3/25/2022,4 star rating,"Alright folks review 500!! This was one of my favorite Ethiopian restaurant in NY, but they have been off lately. Started out with the service when I last went. It was very subpar, and then when I went a few weeks ago they didn't have the gluten free injera and the guy didn't seem to care... So yes I went to Haile Bistro, and they accommodated my needs. I truly am saddened because this was my true go to, and they were definitely 5 star. I would order the veggie sampler that you can order by how many people you have in your party. You can get 5 courses per person and I believe the prices vary from $19 to $57. Don't forget the avacado salad as well! I would also get their honey wine which was delicious. Almost forgot they do also have desserts. I believe it was Rum cake and carrot cake. I have never tried them personally but I have been with folks that have and they enjoy it. Probably one of my shorter reviews but I am just hoping the service changes so I can update them to the 5 stars I know they are!"

We asked our wonderful server Joy to pick whatever for us and this is what she chose. Great selection except for the chicken. It was dry and just meh. The rest of it was delicious! The beef was amazing and full of flavor, soft meat and just overall I wish I had a tub of it. The injera was wonderful. Soft yet had an underlying sour taste which I enjoyed with the food. We also got wine and beer! Small selection but good none the less. If we ever come back which we will, we will definitely come back to this lovely restaurant! Thanks Joy!"
43,tbg4gR3jUUllR28cySo2kg,11/28/2021,5 star rating,"We went to Awash for an early dinner on a Sunday night. At first, there weren't many other people there, but the restaurant started to fill up around 6:30. The environment of the restaurant was very nice and warm, and the waiters were very friendly. Although there was some music in the background, the overall ambiance was pretty quiet and good for conversation.We ordered a sampler platter for three people which included two dishes and 6 out of the 7 vegetarian samplers and two meat dishes (we chose awash chicken and yebeg alicha). There were a lot of options to choose from, but I would personally recommend getting a sampler to be able to try as many things as possible. One thing to know is that there is a $9 fee if you get a sampler for a smaller group of people than you are with. We were really satisfied with the food that we got. There was a large amount of variety, and they were all great. The food also came out relatively fast. Overall, I would definitely recommend trying out restaurant. I think it is a great option for good, casual Ethopian food in the area. The prices were reasonable as well. For a dinner for three, you are able to have a good portion for less than $20 (excluding tip). The waiters were also very friendly and patiently answered all of the questions we had. I will definitely recommend trying this place out. It's a great place to go for with a group, especially those who love to share! That being said, they also do have options for those who don't like to share as well."

The men's room was out of order and they simplly locked it without putting a sign that said so. Customers we're queueing in line assuming someone was inside. But the staff didn't care much and was walking by us until we reached out to ask if there was an issue."

There's outdoor seating too if that's your preference. We both ordered the vegan combination platter, which comes with your choice of 5 different vegetarian options. The platter is served beautifully laid out on a piece of injera. Everything tasted absolutely amazing. You definitely have to try the Mesir Wot and the Shiro if you order a combo platter. I could eat them for the rest of my life and never be dissatisfied. Although it was a hike to get up to 106th street, I'll definitely be returning. Totally worth the travel."
46,tbg4gR3jUUllR28cySo2kg,11/10/2022,5 star rating,Loved loved this place. It was my first time getting Ethiopian food and I thought it was amazing. Got the veggie platter and the spices/seasoning was soo good. The combo together was delicious- really loved the beets complementing the chickpea mix. Everything was wrapped in a type of bread/wrap which has a kind of grainy texture but is very complementary. Got this for take out and 100% would get again. Large portion as we had it for 2 meals.

The meat was a bit salty, and the red lentils were a bit firm, but otherwise it was all tasty. Wish we could've enjoyed the food in person."

It was our first time having an Ethiopian meal and our server was very helpful when she was taking our orders. We were very impressed and so we told ourselves we're coming back for more. We came back again a few weeks later - on a Tuesday night around 6:45pm. We didn't have a reservation but saw that they had a few open tables. The lady said she couldn't take us as they were fully booked for dinner, but offered us the bar seats instead. When we got to the bar, I went to check their website and saw that I could make a reservation for 7pm, 7:15pm, 7:30pm, etc. I make the reservation and waited for a few minutes and showed the lady that I now have a reservation. We were seated right away as there were still about 5 empty tables. I heard the lady refuse to sit another couple after that. I was so turned off by that but of course, I didn't let it ruin my night. The food was still great - very flavorful and looks extremely appetizing on a shareable plate. But customer service on the second visit might make me not want to come back anymore."
49,tbg4gR3jUUllR28cySo2kg,8/25/2021,5 star rating,"Some of my best college food memories were of eating Ethiopian meals in DC with friends of all political stripes one summer. Liberal or conservative -- we all loved coming together over family style meals served over a huge round of injera, and eating with our fingers while debating topics as hot as our food.  Ethiopian food is a bit harder to come by in NYC, but there are a few well-known bastions of the cuisine, including Awash, which seems to serve the real deal. They even offer gluten free, all-teff injera, which tastes far better than my homemade renditions made from the recipe on the side of my Bob's Red Mill bag of teff. It has a really unique flavor and texture that's unlike the softer, more springy wheat-based injera typically served in Ethiopian restaurants in the US. We recently tried the tibs wat and doro wat combo served with three vegetable dishes of your choosing. Between two of us, we were able to try all the vegetables dishes on offer. The tibs wat and doro wat packed some serious punch. Not everyone is going to like the dryish texture of the beef in the tibs wat, or the chicken in the doro wat, but in my experience, this seems to be how it's made everywhere. (It's very similar to Indonesian rendang.) Although we liked the stewed meat, to us the best part of the meal were the plant based dishes. Ater Kik Alicha (yellow split peas cooked in a mild stew and seasoned with onions and herbs) were a nice respite from the spicy heat of most other dishes. This dish was made with small chickpeas, clearly soaked and prepped in-house, and not from a can. They retained a substantial amount of texture.Misir Wat (split red lentil stew cooked in berbere) was excellent and the resemblance to certain Indian masoor dal dishes was uncanny. Again, lentils retained a good amount of texture. (These kinds of lentils are typically made a bit softer in Indian cuisine.)  Shiro Wat (ground spiced chickpea and split pea stew, cooked with chopped tomatoes and onions) had a pretty similar flavor profile to the ater kik alicha, but was cooked to a slightly creamier consistency and was spicier. Atkilt Alicha (potatoes, carrots, and cabbages seasoned with herbs and spices in a mild stew) were tinged turmeric yellow. Enjoyable, not particularly exciting, but another nice option for cooling off your mouth in between bites of spicier things.  Key Sir Alicha (beets and carrots cooked with onions and flavored with herbs and spices in a mild stew) were made with firm, sweet beets, probably prepped from fresh beets. (This is labor intensive, FYI.) Really a nice, light, low-key dish. Gomen (chopped collard greens sautéed with ginger, garlic, onions, and herbs) introduced some important green vegetable matter, but in all honestly, were a touch bland. I didn't get much of the ginger (or perhaps my mouth was too spiced out by this point to detect it). By itself, it needed more salt, but did act as a nice foil for the salty tibs and doro wats. We also tried the beef sambusas, which came three to an order. These are thick pastry rolls made out of phyllo (or phyllo-like pastry) and moderately filled with beef. Flavors and textures were reminiscent of Tunisian or Moroccan cigars / cigares, but far thicker, rolled chimichanga-sized. The food isn't particularly photogenic by delivery, so know that if you dine in at the restaurant, everything is presented beautifully, with neat little scoops of each dish placed on different parts of the injera. The soaked-through injera you get to eat at the end is fantastic. Someone on the delivery website we used called this food, ""Gucci."" I have to agree. All those labor-intensive preparations = very, very Gucci."

Friendly host greeted & checked for vaccination card & ID. Grabbed a seat at the bar where the bartender was friendly & nice. We ordered the Buzzy Brunch & I had an omelette & a shot of Writer Tear whiskey. My date had a burger. It was okay but not sufficient for a guy of his stature. Love the dark wood &!stools.

However, if what you're looking for is an authentic Brazilian experience, the kind you go to when you miss home or want to relive a trip to the country of Pelé, caipirinhas, and lush beaches, keep looking.

It was quite an interesting smorgasbord featuring a cup of meat and bean stew on the side, plus a central dish of rice and various accoutrements like bread crumbs and a fruity spread that you mix in with the stew after your pour it on top of the rice. Each individual part is not meant to be eaten on its own but mixes together to form quite a satisfying whole. I opted for a Brazilian beer (pro tip: you can find some varieties like Proibida that are relatively hard to find anywhere else) instead of an attractive brunch deal where you can get a cup of coffee and a small drink of your choice at a very modest upcharge.Service, though, was quite robotic and perfunctory. I'm not sure if it was because they could care less or if they favor regulars or Portuguese-speaking customers over clear outsiders (I'm Asian-American), but the lack of engagement and interest was quite noticeable. Also, beware: it's cash only here. They do have an ATM on the premises."

We started with gluten free cheese bread (sorry, we dug in before taking a picture...) and it was delicious! The outside had a nice thin crunch and inside melted in your mouth. We shared plates of the feijoada and moqueca and loved both of them. The portions filled you up, however I could've used a little more pork in the feijoada. The pieces I did have were perfect, the meat was nice and soft. The shrimp in the stew was fresh. The collard greens were very refreshing; it looks like a huge portion but trust me, it'll be gone quick! I liked the yucca flour on my food but not too much of it; my other friend LOVED it so I guess it's all about how floury you prefer your dish."

The spicy tonkatsu was all heat and not much flavor, the noodles were lackluster and the char siu was bland.  The tofu was good- maybe this was just an off night for the ramen chef, so giving them 3 stars."

The chips were crunchy, the toppings were plenty, and the chicken was extremely moist (yeah I know some people hate that word, but the only fitting word for how good it was). This is now my new go to nachos 10/10.Enchiladas: I'm not the biggest fan of enchiladas but these looked so good I had to order them. I opted for steak and it was actually cooked really well. The entire dish was amazing but a little overwhelming. The flavors were all really good but at some point it was just too much of one flavor. I would def recommend it if you enjoy enchiladas but I will likely opt for the tacos next time. My favorite part of this dish was definitely the steak, seasoned well and cooked to perfection.

I was worried it would not be filling, but the side dishes of tofu/mushroom, veggies, and miso soup were more than filling. The miso soup was my favorite.The chicken/rice was quite delicious and the rice was perfectly cooked with sauce. Omakase were small slices, but filling enough.Great service. Clean venue. Clean bathrooms. Good cocktails."

I had dinner at Towa a few months ago and ordered the Wagyu Tataki, Gindara Yuan (grilled black cod), kanpachi carpaccio, and Sake Kasu Cheesecake. My favorite was the grilled cod but you could def get this same dish at other places. My least favorite was the wagyu tataki. The wagyu was very chewy. I might like it better if it was cut thinner. I'd recommend only if you love beef and are not picky about it. Sake kasu cheesecake was pretty good but on the heavy side. Overall food was very ok for me. I might come back to try other items."

I showed up a few minutes early and was accommodated right away even though my friend wasn't there yet. Highly recommended and please make a reservation because it gets crowded pretty quickly. I also tried out the seasonal sake flight - pretty tasty! $69 for omakase is not bad at all. We both were content and full. Loved the miso soup and tea that weee served after.

We ordered the strawberry banana crepes and the pancakes with ham and sunny side eggs as our entrees. The crepes were a little thicker than I expected but I loved that, it made the meal more filling. Nevertheless they were still light and fluffy and slightly sweetened. I drizzled syrup onto my crepes to compliment the strawberries and bananas and it was perfect. The pancakes were delicious, they had a great consistency and texture and they were pretty filling as well. We also got the red mango and berry banana smoothies. The red mango had more of a slushy consistency but it was still very sweet and full of mango flavor. The berry banana tasted like the ultimate milk shake, it was thick but still very enjoyable. My only qualm was that the restaurant didn't seem that well kept. We had a hard time finding a table without crumbs on all over. But the waitress was very nice about and wiped down the table immediately. Overall it was still a great experience!"

And the service is very quick with only a few employees!With that said, the employees over at Hawaii Poke Bowl seem to be instructed to ignore simple directives when ordering online. Because of COVID, I decided on 11/28/20 to order through Uber Eats. I requested 3 Poke bowls, with an order asking for Lemon Ponzu sauce on the side and extra jalapenos. Whenever I order this SAME EXACT item request in person, they always oblige. However, for whatever reason, Hawaii Poke Bowl decided to not only refuse the side of Lemon Ponzu sauce, but they also decided to not add ANY jalapenos to the order that specifically requested extra. In addition, the other Poke bowls had a couple of items missing that were specifically printed on the receipt but not found. For example, my own Poke Bowl had no chopped mango or cherry tomatoes.Obviously just a misunderstanding, right? Wrong. Calling up later was met with rushed comments by an overworked employee about me ordering through Uber Eats and how they are not responsible for orders through a third party. When I reminded the employee over the phone that the receipt literally shows the items I requested being ignored, he said he did not have time and that I should come in person next time to ensure I get what I paid for.I am upset by that type of response. I will not risk catching COVID-19 just so I can ensure the employees read instructions. At least be kind and at least admit the mistake happened and it will not happen again, right? But no. I never received a phone call back, never received the ""stamps"" requested over the phone, either. You can spend over $40 here for food, but God forbid you received the correct ordered items/ stamps for food you literally ordered and paid for, right?All in all, I am impressed by the quality of food, but pretty turned off by how casually they ignored my concerns and tried to turn it around on me for ordering through Uber Eats. So sorry for supporting your business?Pros: Excellent quality itemsCons: Overworked employees make mistakes and refuse to admit simple accidents"

Decided this week to go and get Starbucks at this location before my day started because I NEED my espresso. I had been to a few more locations this week and the people did not give me any time of day. The worst service I had in the city with all of those locations. BUT when I came to this location by the Natural History Museum, I was extremely refreshed. The guys and the lady working were so kind and warm as soon as I walked In. First of all, the coffee tasted PERFECT. On top of that, the guys who were taking orders were smiling and creating conversation with all of the customers. They remembered who everyone was. A man dropped his coffee right after grabbing it and when he began to clean it up, the employees told him to not worry about it and that they would get him a fresh cup and clean it up for him and told him to just relax and let them handle it. They were not annoyed by anyone's questions and made it feel like they genuinely wanted to be there. I was so happy with my quick visit and everyone that worked there on Monday 3/2/20. I know people just want to get their coffee and go and they don't care about the environment but Incase they did, this place made sure it was a great experience. Hope they continue to impress."

Half the time I get a sweetened coffee and feel like I have to go hat in hand to ask a frustrated barista to please remake it as an unsweetened coffee. I've never worked at a Starbucks and there may be some kind of system I'm not privy to, but it seems as if two employees are always standing around chatting, one is ringing and the fourth is running around making all the drinks. I imagine it's a tiring job but I just don't get it. Pros: Dirty/soiled bathrooms if you dare. Cons: Everything else."

The bottom line is, I was there during business hours and I'm a customer. I should be able to use the bathroom. I'm just as broke as these people working here and we're all in this together. Disappointed that I was treated so rudely instead of with kindness and compassion.

This was a disaster waiting to happen if I did not find relief - pronto!   I am so glad that the city installed all of these convenient restrooms on almost every corner of the city. Sure, some of them are messy, some are cleaner than others, and some have multiple bathrooms. This restroom location only has one single bathroom that is kind of on the messy side, but it served it's purpose for a deposit.Oh yeah, they also serve some coffee here. It's kind of an odd little layout with only a few tables and chairs so it's really just convenient to use the bathroom, pick up a coffee and go. Today I did my business, grabbed an iced coffee, and was on my way.Finding a usable bathroom in NYC is tough when you are out and about. So glad these are pretty much everywhere now.

I decided to give it a 4/5 because sometimes they mess up the drink order, at times, they give me a grande instead of a venti or they make the drink hot instead of cold. But I recommend going to this Starbucks.  PLUS there is a bathroom!"

If you dare ask about your drink and why it's taking a year, they would simply ignore you.  If you must have starbucks, walk down Columbus 5 more blocks or 2 Avenue to 88th & Broadway."

Decided this week to go and get Starbucks at this location before my day started because I NEED my espresso. I had been to a few more locations this week and the people did not give me any time of day. The worst service I had in the city with all of those locations. BUT when I came to this location by the Natural History Museum, I was extremely refreshed. The guys and the lady working were so kind and warm as soon as I walked In. First of all, the coffee tasted PERFECT. On top of that, the guys who were taking orders were smiling and creating conversation with all of the customers. They remembered who everyone was. A man dropped his coffee right after grabbing it and when he began to clean it up, the employees told him to not worry about it and that they would get him a fresh cup and clean it up for him and told him to just relax and let them handle it. They were not annoyed by anyone's questions and made it feel like they genuinely wanted to be there. I was so happy with my quick visit and everyone that worked there on Monday 3/2/20. I know people just want to get their coffee and go and they don't care about the environment but Incase they did, this place made sure it was a great experience. Hope they continue to impress."

Only one chair was available for my husband and me."

I came here because I needed coffee very early in the morning and it wasn't supplied at my hotel. I got here right when they opened on Sunday at 6:00, not 5:30 as stated in Yelp,  and found that when you go to a Starbucks right when it opens the coffee is exceedingly fresh and good tasting. Either that, or this shop just has better quality than most. There are not too many seats here, but there were some comfortable seats for me right when it opened so I could sit with a nice cup of coffee to start my day."

First world problems but the store is filthy and the service is sloooowww. I mobile order a black unsweetened iced coffee when I leave my apartment and usually wait another 10 minutes when I get there. Half the time I get a sweetened coffee and feel like I have to go hat in hand to ask a frustrated barista to please remake it as an unsweetened coffee. I've never worked at a Starbucks and there may be some kind of system I'm not privy to, but it seems as if two employees are always standing around chatting, one is ringing and the fourth is running around making all the drinks. I imagine it's a tiring job but I just don't get it. Pros: Dirty/soiled bathrooms if you dare. Cons: Everything else."

They take your order then make you wait and help the next person instead of continuing to finish serving you which creates a backlog of people waiting inside a very small space.

Take the order, fulfill the order then move on to the next order. Simple right?????"

Starbucks headquarters should train this branch's employees better because it's a huge disappointment and let down for the company. I would give a no star rating, if I could."

The lady up front was about to give me the code and then a black male working there told me not to use it with a hostile tone.I worked at Starbucks for four years and it was obvious this guy just wanted to get to closing. The bottom line is, I was there during business hours and I'm a customer. I should be able to use the bathroom. I'm just as broke as these people working here and we're all in this together. Disappointed that I was treated so rudely instead of with kindness and compassion. I really hope the general manager sees this and has a conversation with the people working the shift on this night 10-8-17 and explains kindness brings customers back. I will never spend another dime at this location."

This was a disaster waiting to happen if I did not find relief - pronto!   I am so glad that the city installed all of these convenient restrooms on almost every corner of the city. Sure, some of them are messy, some are cleaner than others, and some have multiple bathrooms. This restroom location only has one single bathroom that is kind of on the messy side, but it served it's purpose for a deposit.Oh yeah, they also serve some coffee here. It's kind of an odd little layout with only a few tables and chairs so it's really just convenient to use the bathroom, pick up a coffee and go. Today I did my business, grabbed an iced coffee, and was on my way.Finding a usable bathroom in NYC is tough when you are out and about. So glad these are pretty much everywhere now.

I'm not gonna lie, I was drawn to this cafe because of the adorable name. How cute is ""Cloud Cafe"", am I right? And the entrance and interior of the cafe is just as cute. I walked in to a pretty spacious cafe with a countertop set back from the entrance and to your left as you walk in. The decor is rustic with wooden pieces hung up as well as floral pieces. I walked in and order a chai tea latte and grabbed a brownie. Their other food items looked good but I just wanted something to nibble on. My chai latte came out relatively quickly. I grabbed it and asked to stay in and for the Wi-Fi password. After showing my vax card, I took a seat. It looked like other people came by to work as well. It was a nice quiet spot and I was able to get a decent amount done. The brownie was quite tasty and my chai was ok. Nothing to write home about, but I'm also very picky with my chai tea. This one seemed a bit on the bitter side. Definitely adding this spot to the list for places to work from.  I probably just won't order the chai next time."

I'm moving out of the neighborhood & this is one of the places I'll miss most. It's a beautiful little shop with a decent amount of workspace indoors & a nice outdoor seating area, weather permitting. I've seen it get busy, but it's never been so crowded that I couldn't grab a seat. All of the photos I'm sharing are essentially the same thing: custom egg sandwiches. But you can see that, over time, the quality remains consistent. So delish. The staff is all very nice. I've noticed on several occasions that the owner (I think?) will give a bag of chips to a child if their family's order isn't to-go.  There's also one young woman in particular (I wish I knew her name) who is always there and is always SO sweet. Frequent flier tip: If you sign up for their rewards via CashApp, you receive a nice discount every time you spend $30. Which, if you're me, happens a lot.I love you & I'll miss you, Coffee Cloud.

I came here in the afternoon for lunch. Staff is super friendly and accommodating. They got us seats and menus immediately. I tried the salmon omlette - they only have a salmon frittata but they made it into an omlette for me. We also tried the crab cake which was all crab - really no fillers at all - which I appreciated. I think the quality and the ingredients are great but the food did feel like it was lacking a little in flavor and imagination. Again- still a really good solid spot for a simple meal. I liked my omlette a good deal though I did think it was heavier on the cheese than it needed to be (might be an American touch) The space itself is light bright and airy and you don't feel like youre cramped in. Might be covid protocols in place at this time as well. I would be back if I'm in the area for a casual meal.

Other than that the veal bolognese was perfectly seasoned, the shrimp scampi was cooked perfectly, the grilled bronzino was good, nice big portion.

I see the Trini flag and felt comfort knowing I can have a bake and salt fish or smoked herring. When I first walked into the store, I was taken aback by the muggy heat radiating and the place was empty.... Only the attendant behind the counter, wiping it down. The steamers were full of fresh looking food. After placing my order for two bakes, she put a small corner of salt fish on the bake. Meanwhile, she poked the herring onto the second bake. I told her I needed a little more added to my bake and she said she already put the salt fish. As she's taking my money, she asked why I was looking at her. I told her she felt a ways because she knew I was right about the potion of food given. I took the bag, walked out the store vowing never to return.  (Of course, the herring was Horrible, No flavor just a pile of brown mush. And the salt fish wasn't even that good.....)I HIGHLY RECOMMEND A&A Doubles Shop on Nostrand and Fulton for all your Trini delicacies."

Roti is always on offer but as with many Caribbean restaurants the posted menu is a more a suggestion than definitive guide to what's available. (No doubles on a recent visit, which is quite sad.)My chicken roti was particularly heavy on the tiny bones - a reflection on the severity of the cutting, not the quality of the meat. Roti skin is thicker than most, but tasty none the same. A very large, elaborate briyani was overflowing out of its container when I there, which nearly caused me to not order a roti on my first visit to a roti shop. If only there were more options for Trini fare in North Brooklyn, a might have been more adventurous.Still the combination of plenty of seating a nice product on offer means that I'll be able to spread out on future visits."

I should've known better when I didn't see anyone inside but took a chance anyway. I tried their beef roti last month and it was the worst roti I've had in a long time! The roti skin was very thin & fell apart immediately. The beef was tasteless & unfortunately I also ended up getting mild food poisoning. I'm not sure that the beef was kept at the proper temperature.

This location has a decent size room in the back with plenty of tables... a good space even if you're paying a visit with your kid on a stroller.

Maybe too much kale, but I'm a kale-lover, so it was fine for me. Again, good balance of flavors. Overall, although not cheap, salads are good and plenty, and they provide a complete meal for far less than going to a restaurant. Their bread sucks, though. A couple of words about their service and state of the restroom: there's much to be improved. It took a few minutes to get the attention to those who were preparing the salads, and when they finally decided to do so, they looked like they were doing is a favor.

The host, a polite lady, sat at the front, then hustled over to take our order with efficiency and accuracy. She jotted down every detail lacking errors, and her hospitality was profound.

Its really nice when the neighborhood gets new places. So invited my friend out and we came for brunch on a Saturday morning. The inside and outside were clean and appropriately spaced. We were seated and shown the menu QR Code by a friendly server.  She answered all our questions and we placed our orders. And the wait was on.First the beverages. Water was filtered and really good. My friend's coffee was strong and decent. The oj, not so good. She didn't expect fresh squeezed, but at least a quality store bought variety would have been appreciated. She said the French toast and sausage were ok, but she had a slight allergic reaction to something so she decided to take it home to finish just in case she had a flare up.The red velvet waffle tasted like regular buttermilk, but it was fluffy and delicious. It even reheated well in the toaster oven. Was it worth the $2 upcharge? No, no it was not. The chicken was..... varied.Note: Chicken and waffles are sold with dark meat, leg and thigh or white meat tenders (White meat $3 upcharge). Trying to substitute pieces is a headache. Trust me when I tell you this, it will save you grief.Ok. The leg.... delicious. Juicy, crispy, flavorful and beautifully cooked. The Tenders.... dry and flavorless. I hope they will brine the tenders they way they do the dark meat. I tried reheating an adding sauce at home... nope. Still a struggle. I want to patronize them again, but I think I'll wait a while."

There was no one really there when I went (~12pm) so I was in and out pretty quickly which I loved. The menu however was pretty tricky seeing that I wanted to order waffles and shrimp but with 1 chicken wing as a side( they offered so why not lol). Looking at the menu ordering this should have been 15 bucks or so. but when it was time to pay my meal came to $28!! Was not at all expecting to pay that much for a regular waffle with fried shrimp. The food was super tasty and I enjoyed my meal but a heads up on price variances from whats posted would have been appreciated. Also there was some issue with processing credit cards so I suggest walking with cash for quicker service.

It seemed that lots of Latino dudes were walking in and out to make their deliver (is this why it's calling Banhmigos?).At any rate, there have a decent menu and their sandwiches are American-size--bigger than what you would get at a real Vietnamese banh mi joint. The price at about $8 a sandwich is not a bad. You can never go wrong with the Grilled Pork Banh Mi Sandwich if you're not too adventurous and really don't know what you'd like. They have powder-based boba drinks here as well (free on your birthday!).Someone who works there like Supreme since they put some decals in multiple places visible to customers."

Popular brunch spot, however not completely worth the hype. For a sweet dish, we ordered the Vanilla Bean French Toast, dusted with powdered sugar and served with caramelized bananas, which seemed to ruin the dish for us. To help balance it out, as a savory dish we ordered the Steak & Eggs and opted for the ribeye steak. This was bone in, served with mixed greens, hash, and sunny side eggs. The hash was flavorful however the steak was basic and nothing differentiate the steak from other brunch spots. Food looked better than it actually tasted. Definitely should reserve in advance as the restaurant has tendencies to be booked."

I've heard The Smith is just a classic, dependable spot, and from our experience, I can attest to that. My coworkers and I had made a reservation for a weekday dinner and were seated immediately. We had the Burrata and Crispy Calamari to start. Both were solid appetizers that tasted as expected. We also very much enjoyed their complimentary bread. I got the Roasted Salmon as my main dish, and it was delicious and well-balanced. I loved that tahini sauce that came with it, and the potatoes and spinach also really pulled the dish together.

The menu had many different options which accommodate different dietary options. I chose the bimibap and asked for a hard egg which was happily accommodated. My dish was delicious and the rice was perfectly crispy. Others ordered salads and pasta and enjoyed their dishes as well. For desert we shared an order of ""Quarter Pounders"" which consisted of three giant chocolate chip cookies. This was the one disappointment, I found the cookie to be a bit too salty and very butter forward. This would not deter me from coming again. Next time I would try a different dessert.

I understand it is NYC but there wasn't even enough room for me to comfortably slide into my chair. You could easily just join the conversation of the table next to you which was it a little odd. Will prob head to other spots moving forward.

Later on, he apologized that the prix fixe only had one cut which was the strip. The steak with chimichurri was delicious. It came with shoe-string fries. The starters were decent. The heirloom tomatoes were fresh. The kale and quinoa salad was heavily dressed. The shishito peppers were delish. The mac and cheese was very decadent. For desserts, we had a spread of s'mores in a jar, sticky toffee pudding, blueberry pie, and a giant chocolate chip cookie. Fav was the toffee pudding. Everything else was mega sweet."

I have been to this place a handful of times and finally figured out why I've felt so uncomfortable each time. Racial and gender profiling. I asked for a drink to be remade and he (the owner) lashed out at me saying I had to pay for the drink I didn't want and had to order another. When I confronted him about his history of rudeness, his voice changed and he got super defensive and argued with me profusely followed by being gaslit telling me to look around at his current customers. One of the customers sitting next to us said she too experienced weird vibes and gender profiling and she would not return bc of what she witnessed. I too will never return. And if you don't enjoy being treated this way I advise you stay away."

At the moment, their COVID setup is ordering at the counter and brining it outside to you. If you're seated outside, they'll still serve food to you. Being they're right across the street from me, I've seen their outside seating area grow and become cozy. Their coffee wasn't anything to write home about, but still a great option for when you're on the go. However, if you get a chance to, GET THEIR DRINKS. They come in a to-go pouch and was a good balance of strong and yummy (the two most important things)! In the photo attached, from front to back, we got:-Rosemary Gin Fizz-Blue Dream (Our favorite out of the ones we've tried)-Vodka Soda"

Initially, I didn't think anything of it until I saw a white gentleman sitting across from me (also alone) and no one told him to leave his seat. The white gentleman overheard the situation and was equally confused as me. I got up and walked out and never been back. Please save your coins and spend elsewhere. This treatment was very upsetting.

I noticed that the owner treats his white customers wayyy differently from the black. He is friendly and more conversational with my white friends. Where as when I  order he's extremely rude. Remind you i'm a very outgoing and respectful person, gave him no reason to be rude to me. Today I noticed there were white customers sitting at the 4-top tables alone. Anytime I try to sit there to do work he tells me I have to move to a smaller table and that there is a 1-hour seating limit at his completely deserted restaurant. NEVERRRR hear him saying that to his white customers. Seems like I'm not the only person that has had a similar experience by all the 1 star reviews on here.

Such a shame that a cute place like this one has the worse human being as a employee with CLEARLY some anger issues.  Never in my life had I been treated the way I was treated here. Terrible, TERRIBLE employee. He was from somewhere in Europe (had a thick accent). First off, I understand that some places have their rules, however, if there's a time limit that I can be there, tell me BEFORE I buy, not after. Second, he was talking to me as if I was either his employee or a person asking for something for free. Had a attitude and wasn't helpful at all. When I told him that my coffee was cold (I asked for it hot) his answer was ""what do you want me to do?"" I had to tell him to calm down and, since I didn't want to start an argument in the morning I decided to leave instead. I could've ask for my money back, but I promise you that his life is so miserable that I just felt pity for him. May God bless him and change his heart, because he needs love."

It has fancy cold brew and pastries, craft beer and cocktails, and a bench swing by the window. It is the epitome of gentrification - and yet for yuppie me, it beckoned gently with sun drenched windows and ample seating. I arrived for a morning coffee and pastry (recommend the cheddar scone and croissant sandwich). Seats are available for about 25 and the day set up is conducive for an hour of cafe laptop time, meeting a friend, and leisurely pondering the impact of introducing cold brew to the bodega economy. The coffee and pastries are solid and the menu is surprisingly wide for a dual op restaurant set up.Service is fast, the staff are on top of things, prices reflect the ambitions of the young and restless on the up and up. Single bathroom is clean and there's a high chair available. Can't comment on the more extensive food menu or bar scene, but based on traffic, there are enough millennials to keep it going."

If you've encountered being served by the older man that works here then you would know. I tried getting a delivery, but the man started by saying that he wasn't going to take my order because I returned it last time, which was a fake accusation because everything I order I pay for. And proceeded by hanging up on me. This is only one of the times the employees were extremely rude to their employees. A second time was when the waitress started giving snarky looks because I complained that the food was the incorrect one."

The main dish came with rice and I also asked foe extra side dish of the crispy rice! Oh My G-d!! It was to die for. No matter what you order, if you skip the crispy rice you're not doing it right!

We were craving for some carbs and decided to stop by this Persian restaurant. Their outdoor seating is pretty extensive (around 20-25 peoples worth) and we chose to sit outside since the weather was a perfect 75. I ordered the Mediterranean Salad with Chicken Kabob and bf ordered the Sultani Kebob Lunch which includes a side salad. The bread came with two sauces/dips. I loved the green sauce a lot and the tzatziki like sauce was also very good. The Mediterranean Salad was a sizable salad that I was able to take some of it come. It was extremely fresh and it was interesting that they included a lime instead of a lemon. The chicken kabobs were nicely grilled (not over cooked at all). Overall, pretty great Persian restaurant that we stumbled upon. I could definitely see myself coming back here. They have good food and large portions."

Shiraz I salad was underwhelming on taste as it didn't have much mint or salt, pepper, lemon juice and olive oil. We also ordered the tahdig (crunchy rice), which is off menu, and the large size is truly big and we chose two stews: ghormeh sabzi and fesenjan. This is the only restaurant where I've seen the stews service with actual chunks of meat which were sizeable and tasty. Finally, the mast moosir (shallot yogurt) was well seasoned but could have been creamier (I.e. used strained full fat yogurt). Overall, good experience at this location for our first visit. Our experience has been great with the original location in midtown."

279,GVF4kvXupD18afjpLiPLHA,11/21/2021,5 star rating,"Years ago when we lived in the neighborhood we dined at Marco Polo fairly often.  When we first started going the waiters were dressed in formal wear and there was a pianist in the corner. It was old school Brooklyn charming.  Fortunately it still is, even if the waiters now sport black uniforms and the piano is gone. (So is the guy with the huge gold pinky ring who used to sit at the bar.)We went on a whim last night for old time's sake and we were not disappointed.  It was a slight bummer not to be seated in the main room but we had last minute reservations so we were seated in the side room.  Literally from the moment we sat down, the service was as attentive and professional as ever.  The hostess came over to apologize for not asking to check my coat when we walked in.We started with Old Fashioned's which were served in stemmed glasses.  We ordered half a dozen blue point oysters ($14) which were really fresh. The mignonette was a little heavy on the shallots but still great.  We also ordered the  ""Marco Polo Caesar/original 1983 recipe"". ($13) It was fine, nothing special but definitely on the skimpy side for essentially a small plate of romaine lettuce.   For entrees we ordered the Veal Marsala ($23) and the rack of lamb ($44 - a little pricey but perfectly cooked), both of which were absolutely wonderful. Entrees were served with mashed potatoes, carrots and broccoli.  I kind of wish we had also ordered the fettucine special because I was nostalgic for it, but our entrees were excellent.  We did not have room for dessert!Brooklyn has changed so much in the 30+ years I have called it my home so it was nice to return to a familiar old haunt.  Our dinner last night reminded me why we loved it so much when we lived over there, and we will definitely return soon, hopefully with a large group, because that's what Marco Polo really calls for.  I was really impressed with the service from beginning to end.  Can't wait to go return!"

Our waiter was friendly and professional as was the entire staff.  Tiramiau, affogato, creme brule, and chocolate mouse all made in house and all were great."

The service was great and we were actually served by multiple servers; we were never ignored or forced to wait. The atmosphere was a little noisy and not intimate, but that's only because we were seated in between two big parties.For drinks, I got the basil martini, which was just as refreshing as it sounds, and a glass of pinot grigio. My partner got a glass of sauvignon blanc.We got oysters to start and honestly, I've never gotten cheaper oysters anywhere else that still taste pretty good. I then got the lobster ravioli, which was great and rich in lobster flavor, and my partner got the calamarata, which was pretty good albeit a little cold. Overall, definitely recommend!!!"

This business has made Union and Court Street its home for many years.  Back in the day, special occasions for celebration and just regular dining out brought my family and I together to enjoy really good food.As the neighborhood continued to change with an influx of many different restaurants of various cuisines making its home in the vicinity and the passing away of some of my loved ones, Marco Polo became a memory and a reminder when I walked by on the block.But just a couple weeks ago, we decided to reconnect with Marco Polo and I'm so glad we did. We looked over the menu at the bar and I noticed how cozy the  dining area was--fully  decked out in holiday mode/decorations.Their menu had many good selections and being in the mood for pasta and seafood, my selection was the black spaghetti with shrimp and squid. I was informed it also included salmon but there was not one piece evident once I unwrapped it when home. The other mains were Pappadelle with Veal Bolognese and a Chicken Cutlet  prepared with truffle oil, asparagus,  cheese and a side of pasta.Once I got home, I observed the serving of each main to be quite large, particularly the pasta. Or did it just grow in volume as pasta is noted for doing?I really enjoyed my pasta and ate every strand and morsel of seafood. There was no lacking in the quantity of shrimp/squid. The other mains were also winners and overall, everything was very enjoyable--delicious and filling. Price point for the three main courses was $80.A Yelp check offered a small tin of homemade cookies. They tasted just like my grandmother's!Next time, I want to dine in and I'll make it a point to visit more in 2020.An old reliable and delicious staple in Carroll Gardens."

The trays were stacked on top of a garbage bin but they looked dirty so I didn't grab one. Some woman lined up right behind me and she wasn't social distancing so I told her to stand on that other circle so we are at least 6 feet apart! At this point, I was frustrated. Good thing, the bread items were packed individually. I grabbed the Roast Pork Bao because I am allergic to pretty much everything except MEAT...of course lol =)One of the employees was calling out for the next person which was me so I placed the Roast Pork Bao on her tray then she moved all the trays down in an assembly line to the cashier. Everyone in front of me and behind me was not social distancing at all! Ugh, I was just sandwiched between them. Tai Pan Bakery, you have all these social distancing signs up but no one was following the rules!I finally paid for the Roast Pork Bao ($1.80) and I jetted out of there. The Roast Pork Bao was tasty but definitely not worth my time because it was way too crowded.

My favorite are their chicken pie, beef pie, coconut cream bread, egg custard and many more. So I just named a few so you can pick any of your liking. They never run out and is opened 365 days a year!Get your baked goodies on!"
302,SiM5G8LqVW9XQaPLbFkD7Q,3/1/2021,5 star rating,"Came here after a fellow yelper recommended this spot. They have your classic pineapple buns with filling, cakes by the slice or the whole things, and beverages. Their BBQ red pork are absolutely delicious (I always buy a couple for breakfast/lunch during the work week) and their egg tarts are so good. Some places make the egg tart with a cookie/shortbread crust -- but they make it with super flaky crust."
303,SiM5G8LqVW9XQaPLbFkD7Q,9/11/2019,5 star rating,"A classic Chinese bakery and one of my favorites. They're always bustling, serving customers and bringing out fresh pastries. I love their buns (especially the pineapple ones which have the best flakey topping) and their egg tarts! The egg tarts are super smooth and the crust is always flakey. They also have yummy cakes that are light in both the cake and frosting. Their mango cake is one of my favs; it has fresh mango and a yummy cereal type of crust on the bottom!Although there may be a language barrier if you don't understand Chinese as well, you can just point to whatever you want and they'll understand. The staff also understands basic English. As for the buns, you get to pick out with ones you want on a tray and they package it to go for you."
304,SiM5G8LqVW9XQaPLbFkD7Q,10/30/2021,5 star rating,"Word of ""warning"" - they sell cakes by the pound but I'm pretty sure they actually mean kg. I just picked up a 2 lb cake and it was probably about 12 inches and at least 5 pounds, definitely enough to feed over 20 peopleBut love Tai Pan! They are my go to for birthday cakes and egg tarts"

306,R0l-ISnjkUNaPtKQ1f1PVQ,1/14/2013,3 star rating,Went for drinks when I was out & about in the city.  Had a great time with my friends but don't recall much aside from the very friendly bartenders & great eclectic jukebox of old school country music.The decor is old fashioned and quaint.  The drinks are stiff & relatively inexpensive.
307,R0l-ISnjkUNaPtKQ1f1PVQ,8/18/2014,2 star rating,"Came here for my birthday over the weekend (as did about 3 other people and their 6762354 friends - HI BIRTHDAY FRIENDS!!) and, while the space is awesome and the jukebox is possibly the best I've seen in the city in terms of ""you cannot pick a bad song,"" the bartender was randomly a dick. Oh, and it sucks balls when you waste $5 on the jukebox and half your songs get arbitrarily cut off or skipped. Never mind the fact that (and this is not the bar's fault in any way) you're bound to get stuck in some long-ass line for the bathrooms, and some stumbling drunk ass clown will undoubtedly just try to cruise past all 12 people doing the pee pee dance and bust into the nearest bathroom. That's hilarious the first 3 times you almost witness/get involved in a fight, and then it's just stupid and makes me wish I had a stun gun or adult diapers or something.There are way too many laid back bars in the area for me to ever go back to one with some random dick bartender, bathroom traffic jams, and, regardless of its stellar song collection, a jukebox that screws you out of your jams/hard earned $5.A solid ""meh,"" leaning dangerously toward ""fuck this place."""
308,R0l-ISnjkUNaPtKQ1f1PVQ,4/3/2013,4 star rating,"I really like this place a lot! I wound up here in NYE after dinner as we were bar hopping, waiting for our potential venue to officially open. With that being said, this place had the best music and was relatively close to where we found a parking spot. The music, played by DJ ""Chic"" Norris was great. It was a real smooth mix. I can't explain it...some old school Beyonce, a little hip hop, jazz, hipster vibes, funk, bohemian soul...the list goes on. While here I actually acquired a crazy level of insobriety (if that makes sense). I mean the drinks were REALLY strong. I had two shots- one was a house tequila mix shot, and the other was a pickle back (jame-0 + pickle juice); following those shots I had an LIT. Seriously that's all I needed for the whole entire night! The place had a great crowd too! Not so much mixed though. It was the typical Williamsburg crew plus some out of towners. I met a wonderful group of girls from New Orleans and chatted away the night as I was here. The event planner, and his boyfriend came up to us and totally made us feel welcomed in the bar and let us know where to go to find out about all the cool events they have going on periodically.All in all I had a great time. I would venture back here especially to pregame, but even just hang out if I want a semi low key night!"
309,R0l-ISnjkUNaPtKQ1f1PVQ,10/8/2017,5 star rating,"I always joke that I live at this bar, but in all truth, it's a home- not just for someone who has been coming in here for years, but to anyone who walks in off the street as well. It's a no-nonsense, good dang bar. Don't come here for a cocktail- come here for a country tune on Sundays with John and a beer and shot, or the best (and strongest) $5 frozen margarita you'll ever have. Free pulled pulled pork sandwiches on Tuesday's with Kate. Golden tee and pinball if you get bored. Bottom line is this is a well-established neighborhood spot with a solid beer list and a friendly face to greet you at the door no matter what the day entails."

315,R0l-ISnjkUNaPtKQ1f1PVQ,2/1/2011,4 star rating,"Low key bar with celebrity owner. Or is it?I am surprised at how relaxed Lady Jay's is. I mean, it has all the right elements to be an overhyped, overblown place. For one, it's located near the Lorimer L stop, which is prime Williamsburg drink/nightlife-land. But oddly, it is so beyond-laid back, it's shocking. For two, its owner (and main bartender!) is no other than celebrity chef and NYMag poster boy, Sam Mason, who has his own TV show (Dinner with the Band) and was the lead chef of the love-it-or-hate-it-now-defunct Tailor in SoHo. Finally, the bar menu is short and sweet, with no crap and all quality, and at pretty amazing prices ($5 for a shot of whiskey and a beer of choice; $6 for local microbrews).If I could create my ideal life, it would perhaps entail owning a chill bar like this. Only I didn't do it. Sam Mason did. And it rocks."

323,x7Y30Y_LUMuDRBejmNRrCQ,3/1/2020,4 star rating,"I walked in here not knowing what to expect at the restaurant. Just know there's no restroom or sink for patrons to wash their hands. They do have hand sanitizers and wipes, but personally I prefer washing my hands. Anyways, I got a tequeno which is cheese wrapped in dough since it comes with a free check-in on yelp. It was yummy especially with sauce on the side. I also tried a sampling of their empanadas. Not bad. For my order, I had to get what they're known for which is the patacon sandwich. I got one that they have on their menu - the llanero one which has steak, onions, and cheese sauce. I tasted way too many onions on this sandwich. They wrote out what is a patacon and apparently it's two green plantains breaded to form a sandwich. It was a bit messy to eat, but glad they served it in aluminum foil wrapping. All in all I'll be returning to try other items, but probably when I already washed my hands and don't have to use the restroom."

I ordered assorted patacones, Tacucho, salads and empanadas, and everything was labeled properly.  The food was fresh, hot and everyone complimented it.  It was a great option for a group lunch!"

326,QdmvRfJb86BVvk6A-J5gAg,11/20/2022,4 star rating,"Best GF bagels in New York! The only place I've found that makes me feel like i'm eating a ""regular"" bagel. Also love getting sandwiches, dinner etc here. There are lines on certain days and times (especially weekends) so try and avoid that. It is a little expensive but the convenience of being able to order anything on the menu - including common GF cravings like fried fish, bagels, cookies, etc is totally worth it."
327,QdmvRfJb86BVvk6A-J5gAg,11/8/2022,4 star rating,"I've heard great things about the bagels here so I was super excited to try one! The bagel was dense (not a negative for me!) & savory/salty, which I prefer! The cream cheese was delicious too but my issue is the ratio...we asked for a good portion of cream cheese because we ran into a similar issue a few days prior (minimal cream cheese is a big issue for me) & we still barely had any on them. There were parts of the bagel that had basically zero cream cheese (you can see what I'm referring to in pic). I really liked the bagel itself but the missing cream cheese was a big miss."
328,QdmvRfJb86BVvk6A-J5gAg,3/30/2023,2 star rating,Very underrated. My bagel was only okay and the seer ice wasn't great. They were also sold out of most items.
329,QdmvRfJb86BVvk6A-J5gAg,12/3/2022,5 star rating,"I wish there was a location everywhere. I can't believe that it's 100% gluten free - It felt weird not having to double check that there won't be any cross contamination. You walk in and usually the past couple times I've gone they have a long line. However, despite that once you get to the cashier they are usually so welcoming and enthusiastic that you or just me immediately forget the line was an issue. You place your order at one end of the counter and at the other end you order any pastries and/coffee and then pay. Very different system of paying and it takes a bit to make great food definitely worth the wait."
330,QdmvRfJb86BVvk6A-J5gAg,2/3/2023,4 star rating,"This place is a haven for gluten free peeps and I'm kinda concerned for my wallet with how often I know I'll be frequenting this spot. The food was so delicious, I could've cried. I got a toasted everything bagel with salmon, chive cream cheese, tomatoes, arugula, pickled onions, and capers. So. Freaking. Delicious. I even came with my dad who swung by Zabar's a few streets away to get his bagel, and as far gf bagels go, he thought this was as good as it gets.We also ordered the chocolate babka and linzer tart. The chocolate babka is a teensy bit dry (like a lot of gf baked goods) but very chocolate which I loved. It's quite thick, and I've been eating a bite of it throughout the week. The linzer cookie was good too, but nothing particularly special.We came here around 10:45, and while inventory seemed to be going strong still, the line was nuts. The employees were very nice, but like other reviewers have noted, there must be a better way to organize the set up. I waited at least 20 minutes to place my order. Once placed though, the bagel came out pretty quickly. Will surely be back again and am excited to try their other sweet treats!"
331,QdmvRfJb86BVvk6A-J5gAg,10/14/2022,2 star rating,"Echoing others here...the baked goods are quite good, but the line and cashier situation is completely illogical. They need a new store manager. There is a line for bagels and spreads, and then only on certain days, there is a separate line for baked goods only (since they are ready to eat and take under a minute for them to get your order ready). Both lines converge to one cashier, so there's contention between the lines. Every single time I've gone in, a customer or employee is confused. Some days you're told you didn't have to wait on the bagel line to get baked goods. Other days you are told to wait on the long bagel like just to get a baked good. Stop wasting your customers' time. Just have two separate cashiers. The store has space for it. You can also sell more volume if you can figure this trivial puzzle out."
332,QdmvRfJb86BVvk6A-J5gAg,6/17/2022,5 star rating,I was on a mission to find the perfect gluten free bagel while in NYC and oh did I find it! An allgluten free bakery! I felt like I was eating a proper New York Bagel and was just so happy! And the homemade blueberry cream cheese...yum! Oh and then I saw the black and white cookies...and had to get one of those too because when in New York! If you're gluten free and even if you're not...a must try!
333,QdmvRfJb86BVvk6A-J5gAg,2/8/2023,5 star rating,"Solidly good bagels. But they're gluten free! So that's extremely impressive, because gluten free tastes like crap! Not here, though. Best gluten free bagels ever! And I'm very happy the prices are affordable."
334,QdmvRfJb86BVvk6A-J5gAg,10/14/2022,3 star rating,"I came to Modern Bread and Bagel with a friend who is gluten-free. We arrived around 11:30am on a Friday and there was quite a long line (which got a lot worse by noon so I recommend getting here before then during weekdays). We waited around 15-20 minutes before we ordered at the counter. You then wait while they prepare your order before you can pay at a separate cashier and order additional things such as pastries and coffee/tea. My friend ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese on an everything bagel and she really enjoyed it, she said it is one of the best bagels she has had that is gluten free. I got an everything bagel with lox, plain cream cheese, and tomato slices as well as some coffee with milk. I had originally ordered my bagel toasted but when I saw the batch they had just taken out looked a little too toasted already, I decided to tell them not to toast mine. I am glad I made this decision-- the bagel was already a little bit burnt which I did not love but the flavor was not as affected as I anticipated. The bagel itself was on the smaller side, but the dough had a chewy consistency on the inside and had a good distribution of plentiful seeds. Whoever cut my bagel did not do so entirely so when I tried to separate the two halves if fell apart and it was a bit of a pain to eat but flavor was okay overall and they put a generous amount of lox in the sandwich which I appreciated. My coffee was a pretty good size too and I thought the price was reasonable for it. My gluten free friend mentioned to me that she had also bought a cookie from them a few days ago which she really loved, and she thinks their baked goods are some of the best she has had! Overall, I had a good experience here. I could not really tell these bagels are gluten free so if that is one of your concerns, worry not and have an open mind! Giving this place a 3.5 stars based on my single isolated experience mainly due to the inefficient ordering system as well as the fact that my bagel was a little burnt and unevenly cut/ messy to eat. Will definitely come back to give it another chance though if I have another gluten free friend in town!"
335,QdmvRfJb86BVvk6A-J5gAg,1/5/2023,2 star rating,"Pretty sure that intentionally have designed their customer flow to be frustrating. Takes forever to get food. Food comes out differently than drinks. Pastries aren't together with bagels. What's frustrating is they have enough employees, so this is a management issue. They can do better. Food itself is good just hard to put yourself through that torture to get it."

337,olRNNJCJ2TJvPRmjBiOcGA,8/24/2021,5 star rating,If you are craving for some spicy Chinese food... I mean proper spice... Look no further. I ordered the Hot And Sour Vegetable Gai Ma with Dry Noodles and it was spicy and absolutely delicious. I went with the spice level as Spicy and thoroughly enjoyed it. Any more spicy and it would've been too difficult to handle.If you order online it's slightly expensive than ordering it in person/store.
338,olRNNJCJ2TJvPRmjBiOcGA,10/13/2022,4 star rating,"A solid experience. Self service. Reasonably priced.Limited options for the carbo challenged. We began with the pork, chive and shrimp dumplings. These were savory and juicy. Beef tripe salad was tender and lightly seasoned. The best dish was the string beans, nicely seasoned and crisp. As La Portena doesnt do carbs, I was a solo act on noodles. I plumped for braised Hunan beef. The server steered me to medium which was surely hot enough. The beef was tender, the spice was nice, but the noodles could use an upgrade. The broth worked well to unify the dish.Decor is pretty basic. I'd take out next time."
339,olRNNJCJ2TJvPRmjBiOcGA,8/31/2021,4 star rating,"I ordered S15. Stir-Fried Bamboo Shoots w Pork in Dry Noodle Mix at MILD spice level and oof, that was quite the kick of spice even at what I thought was the lowest spice level. I can't handle spice well so had I known there was an option to order in ""No Spice,"" I would have opted with that. I hope they let that be known verbally or written somewhere.Regardless, it was a very tasty meal. Took me a long while to finish but I managed to clean out every bit of my generously portion-sized meal. Despite it being called Dry Noodle Mix, it is definitely NOT dry with all the rice noodles doused in plenty of chili oil. There are condiments, cutlery, and napkins by the counter. It's an ""order & pay at the counter then pick up your food when it's ready"" kind of place. There was plenty of seating that was appropriately spaced out and good with any size parties. A single bathroom that's hidden out of sight - it's across the cashier.Spent nearly 2 hours here eating at ease with my friend as we caught up with life.Please clean up after yourselves."

I was impressed there was more meat on our plates than the last time we came years ago. I guess they improved after people complained?Regardless it's your normal Boston Market meal that always has that fall off the bone quality rotisserie chicken and the sides are always delicious especially their mac and cheese, which I totally had to spoil myself with a bite from my boyfriend's plate.

The order just disappeared with no indication that the order was filled. And the female employee with loose 6-8 inch hair and light green shirt has the NERVE to give me an attitude, like I'm supposed to know that the order is finished when there was no indication by the staff, no name called out. And she goes the extra step to add insult. When I get home, I see that there are no napkins or forks in the bag. After this piss poor experience, you will be vary hard pressed to get me to dine in or order from this location ever again."

357,K2umRMzymZZOmCIzyHsbDw,3/8/2018,1 star rating,This has to be the WORSTTTT place to order from!!! I've never seen a store more unorganized and unprofessional then this. I usually place my order in the Hylan blvd store and never have a problem. Now being this location opened they refuse to take my order and tell me I must order from this location. This is the 2nd and absolute LAST time I do so. They made me wait over an hour for food... when it finally came it was cold... and an item I asked about was described completely different that what was sent. I asked for fries and got breakfast potatoes. They kid who took my order explained that they were the same thing as fries. Absolutely NOT!! Extremely disappointing and sadly they lost my business! They offered to credit me money back but I am just at the point of not ever wanting to order from this location again.. Better? Try worst .. French fries?  looks like Coleslaw and smell atrocious Never again

One week later tried again but was told their online ordering platform is  credit cards only. So we order by phone at 10:30 and ask it to be delivered 11:40 bc we are teachers and that's when our break is- we were told no problem and the driver will text when he gets there. So 20 min later delivery driver texts AND CALLS the teacher to come get the food, sure lets leave 30 kids unattended. So she gets someone to accept the food now our food is cold when we can actually eat it and when I wrote to let them know he said sorry that's the best we can do "" have a better day"". I will be sure to order from a ""better"" restaurant next time. To lose the business of a school order is a big mistake."

He let me know ahead of time the menu was new and to check it out!! When we got there he gave us some pointers and suggestions from the new menu as well as let us know if we had any old favorites they would still be possible to order! Pat and the staff are always so friendly and helpful especially when Alice was having a burger and we were all looking and asking her what she was having! Needless to say I had what she was having! After a great lunch that everyone enjoyed Pat convinced us we needed to end w some cookies! 3 suggestions from the table of 5 better lovers lol...1-pickles 2-mustard 3-bring back peanut butter cookies!!!!

Later that night we all suffered from the sweats, diarrhea, and stomach pains. I was not going to write this review, I was only going to call and let a manager know to see if anyone else reported getting sick. The ""manager"" was very rude and insisted that it had to have been from something else I ate that day and that no one else but me got sick. I told her that ALL 3 of us got sick.

Drive thru line can be long depending on the time of day you go. My suggestion is to not try to enter by making a left from Northern Blvd. and to instead get in line on the side of the road Wendy's is on. I have seen some silly folks causing a bottle neck of cars as they were stuck behind a car already waiting and now in oncoming traffic on Northern Blvd.

The cashier seemed very over being at her job. Glad that the spicy nuggets are back. There's lots of seats here. Wish they'd turn on the heat! We came on during the 'winter storm warning' day, and quickly ate our lunch because the inside of this place was cold. There's a birthday cake frosty promotion right now, but if you don't order it as a sundae, then it'll just come as vanilla ice cream. This was not specified during our order."

There was only one cashier and I counted like two other people in the back...very short-staffed since it was also a drive-thru. Nice Wendy's added a Crispy Chicken BLT to the 4 for $4 menu...I ordered that for my dad and I got the Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger then replaced my drink with a Vanilla Frosty. I didn't get a receipt because she didn't bother to tell me the receipt machine was broken after I asked for my copy. Wow the wait to order vs the wait for your food is ridiculously long and slow =( The cashier was putting my order together and kept forgetting to give me a cup for my dad's beverage and my Vanilla Frosty. Finally we got our food and the temperature of the burgers was cold. Are you kidding me...I waited more time for a new order of the burgers while my fries and nuggets were getting cold. I can't win even when I sat down to try to enjoy my food. The burgers seems to be the ones that I told the cashier about which the staff probably microwaved because the lettuce was soggy not crisp...SMFH! Not once was anyone apologetic.

376,tD2l7pW7DxiyDPLlZ9URcA,9/27/2022,4 star rating,Expensive but worth it. They serve up some of the best breads and pastries I have ever eaten. From the poppy seed roll breakfast sandwich to their chocolate rugelach everything is so finessed. I almost always get a fruit tart and almond croissant when I visit. I'm a regular!
377,tD2l7pW7DxiyDPLlZ9URcA,9/8/2022,4 star rating,Breads Bakery have locations all over nyc and I don't really know what they are known for. The pastries looked fresh so that is a good sign. I tried the black and white cookie and wasn't the biggest fan. It had dark bitter chocolate and a different preparation than a normal cookie. The croissants were fresh and flaky. I will go with those next time.
378,tD2l7pW7DxiyDPLlZ9URcA,5/20/2022,5 star rating,"The chocolate babka and rugelach is of course famous but branched out to other things this visit especially given May cheesecake month (what a wonderful month).I had never gotten any savory food before and the egg salad on their roll was so tasty - the roll was excellent and fluffy as befits the name. We also got the pashteda, which they describe as a savory cheesecake, but is essentially a quiche and was just alright.We got their rhubarb and basil cheesecake tartlet and chocolate cheesecake tartlet. Both were excellent and the 4 of us were divided as to which one was better. I personally liked the chocolate more because there were so many different textures and had a strong dark chocolate flavoring and wasn't too rich. The rhubarb for the other was very present but didn't really taste any basil."

We've tried a number of baked goods and always go back to two favorite items: the baguette and the black &white cookie. Other goods are mostly standard (good but not special), I.e. the croissants are comparable to many others in the city. We will continue to be regulars and stick to what we enjoy."

Yes, you're in the area because you just had a one night stand or booty call the night before and you're desperately trying to leave their apt. No, if you're looking to try these due to some overhyped social media post where you are going out of your way. They are good but not out of your way good. And if you are looking to secure some, make sure you go at 8 or later. They aren't out of the oven and iced until then."

I'm a fan of several of their baked goods including their chocolate rugelach, black and white cookies, potato bureka, spinach bureka, and feta bureka. If you're interesting in snagging black and white cookies, especially on a weekend, you'll want to go early in the day. I will say that these black and white cookies are very different from the traditional light and cake like variety. These are flaky and buttery. Aside from the icing on top, there's a layer of chocolate and vanilla underneath the frosting.I prefer their rugelach to their babka personally. The bureka make for a good snack. They aren't too big but the puff pastry is flaky and the fillings are good. I wish they were a little bigger. As a warning, the prices are on the higher end."

385,tD2l7pW7DxiyDPLlZ9URcA,10/18/2022,5 star rating,"4 &1/2. This review is very much specific to this location insomuch as it is primality focused on lavishing praise on it's brilliant, completely revisionist take on the cities most undeniably iconic of cookies, the black and white.    Correct (to some degree) to all the haters who have pointed out the obvious fact that this version deviates from the classic in countless ways.  Duh, and who cares, it's delicious and manages to pay homage to the classic cookies precisely for the fact that it honors it in a completely original way.  In short, B&w's here get the cronut treatment, with the dense, cake-like foundation of a classic B&W getting swapped out for a decently deliciously and buttery, layered lamented crust akin to the type of the finest of French delicacies.  The classic thick, fondant style crackly black and white topping is likewise swapped out in favor of a more delicate vanilla glaze atop the white side and rich cocoa powder and dark chocolate chips baked into the black side.   I covet and treasure a classic b&w as much as any NYer (and for my money Ridgewood's great Rudy's bakery is a strong contender for best in the city in that category) but the updated version here is as great as any of those to be found, while again being brilliantly completely different from all of those.  Seinfeld famously said of the B&W, ""look to the cookie"" and the innovative version here are worthy of nothing less than a hard stare.   I can't recall if I was actually ever at any of the previous location of this establishment before checking out this branch upon hearing of its new school b&w, which I believe is still only on offer at this location.   I've seldom sampled much beyond that when here, but I can legitimately say the few other things I've tried, namely the spinach-stuffed bureks  and bec variants, have all been uniformly delicious and exhibited a similar brilliance in showcasing creative homages to classics.  Bonus points for extra quick and efficient streamlined service that really keeps the constant line moving.    Sure it's on the pricey side, but you are literally smack dab in the middle of Manhattan and getting an elevated NYC experience, so quit ya whining haters!"

They also sell pre-packaged sushi and have a fruit far. The only negative I've found so far is they don't have enough seating, especially during the busy lunch hours. They definitely have the space for more tables and should fill it."

Staff behind the counter is frumpy and my past four online orders all had some mistakes. One was lost entirely, in others the sauces I ordered weren't added to the bag, were incomplete or got mixed up - with no explanation.I will keep ordering empanadas here - at least for now, but I sincerely hope that the expansion in delivery doesn't result in the quality of the local service degrading any further."

Their extensive menu of over 20 different empanada fillings may have you believing they are a jack of all trades and master of none, but I tried a medley of fillings and thought every bite was a party in my mouth.They delivery quickly and and the empanadas always come piping hot when they arrive, wafting the amazing smell of fried  dough through the room. Each crispy dumpling is stamped with their store name but also the filling of each so you don't have to wonder about the fillings and confuse one for another. Their filling offerings include BBQ chicken, shrimp, codfish, pizza burger, and broccoli & mozzarella, among many others. I love that they offer multiple vegetarian and even pescatarian options, so there's something for every palate. I particularly enjoyed the really flavorful shrimp empanada and another filled with guava and cheese.I'm chuckling remember someone posting a photo on Yelp at a different business of the inside of an empanada that lacked any filling and called it ""empty nada."" These are anything but empty nadas and is very much like a city full of the best empanadas you can get your paws on."

Last Sunday (11/20) my boyfriend had ropa vieja empanadas and got the worst food poisoning either of us have ever seen. He started experiencing horrible stomach pains about an hour after eating them, and was vomiting incessantly for quite some time.  We had to take him to the emergency room because he was so dehydrated. While there, he experienced temporary paralysis throughout his entire body and could not stand or feel anything. The doctors attributed this to the severity of his dehydration from the food poisoning. He had to spend an entire night in the ER and was given fluids and medication to combat the sickness.I cannot go back knowing that someone made such a reckless oversight and served food that was clearly contaminated."

The space itself stood out immediately with its cute, colorful, modern exterior on a mainly monochromatic block. We went inside to salsa music playing and employees have a lighthearted chat. At first they seemed a little gruff, but we would soon see an influx of pickup orders customers revolving in and out. I ordered the apple pie one and returned immediately to order 2 ""plain chicken"" (Def not plain,  very savory). There was a small wait, but it was only because these treats are made to order! How nice!!! A freshly fried empanada without being in a cuchifrito state of being, lol. The apple pie one was a little disappointing, the apples were hard and a little plain. I wish they were at least a little cooked. I throughly enjoyed the chicken ones, the chicken was savory and tender. The crowd died down by the time my chicken empanadas were ready and the ladies all were smiling and friendly, sending me off with good day and come again wishes. See you all again soon!"

Wasn't a huge fan of pastelon cause there was too much plantain and not enough meat so it was very sweet. Also the empanadas are on the smaller side, 3 was just barely enough to get me full and I definitely could've gone for a 4th. Would highly recommend getting the avocado sauce and the heat sauce.

I had both the guava and the applied pie and honestly, I can eat like 40 of them if I had the chance lol the menu is extensive so there's no way you can try them all in one sitting, I mean I guess for some people you can but that was a challenge I did not want to take on. I had the 100% beef which was just that, only ground beef, no seasoning, no salt and pepper, garlic, onion, nothing-- so brace yourself for that. The chicken, shrimp, steak and onions were all amazing though. Well seasoned and perfectly fried. I will definitely be back here. Empanadas are always the defect snack or meal"

I honestly couldn't even pick which one was my favorite, because they we all THAT good!!I was a little disappointed with the rice and beans though. It lacked in flavor and was bland. My beans were also on the harder side and could have been cooked through more. The empanadas are made fresh, so expect to wait a few minutes.

400,tZVN5tsprJpUOF953jcg1w,1/7/2022,4 star rating,"To celebrate the New Year, we ended up getting a ton of pasta as well as some calamari! We also got some free garlic knots due to our order being over $21 as well as some bread slices as well. Garlic knots: In hindsight, I think I would have paid for these because these were fire! The bread was so fluffy and had the perfect amount of garlic and herbs in them. Bread: This was kind of questionable? It was a bit too airy for me, and the sesame seeds seemed mismatched for this type of bread. We ended up throwing this away as soon as we took a bite. Calamari: I feel like sometimes calamari from Italian restaurants can either be a hit or miss, but this was delicious! Surprisingly the rounder pieces tasted more delicious than the super crispy ones that look more like squid. Adding the lemon also made the calamari delicious as well! Spaghetti Bolognese: This was probably the best pasta according to my husband! This was such a classic having spaghetti pasta paired with ground-up meat sauce. It tasted super home-y and comforting!Fettuccine Alfredo: This pasta was the one I thought would taste the best, but was actually my least favorite. It was super creamy, but that was the only substance this pasta had. Drowning something in creamy sauce doesn't necessarily make it flavorful. This one came with a ton of sausage, which was a positive on this pasta.Pesto Pasta: The pesto pasta was probably my favorite out of all of the pasta choices! It didn't feel too heavy and felt super easy to eat. This one also came with a ton of sausage, which paired well with the pesto! Overall, we had such a great experience with Libretto's! I've also seen a lot of great reviews on their pizza, so I would love to try this place again for their pizza!"

Not typically an area in town I hang out in and thought I would grab a drink before I headed to a fashion week event I was attending. My friend and I showed the female bartender ID and vaccination card happily but she was looking at us like we were doing something wrong. She definitely did not like us based on how we're were dressed and I felt very uncomfortable. My friend wasn't sure what to order so I went ahead first and asked if I could have a vodka Red Bull (not my typical drink but I needed some caffeine) and she retorted extremely rudely that they didn't have Red Bull like I had asked her for the most ridiculous thing in the world and seemed to mock me. Judging from other reviews it seems this woman is very unpleasant, not sure why she has a job in the service industry and I wouldn't be inclined to come back again."

We found space at the bar and sat down to ice cold drinks and good conversation.  The bartenders were friendly and the atmosphere was light and fun. 2 college games were on the TV and someone from the French culinary academy made them a cake and while we were there they offered us some which was nice. The only thing negative I have to say is that is smelled a bit like a frat basement but that's ok and it is kinda what you expect when you go to a pub. I really enjoyed my time there and when I go back to the area and have some time to kill, I'll go back!"

Similar to an ice cream parlor this place lets you sample the plethora of flavors. Vanilla, Panne cotta, chocolate, caramel, and many more. I went with the caramel and it overall tasted like a good caramel pudding with rice inside. The taste itself was overall well done but the texture is not my personal favorite. All in all, good service, trendy decor, and objectively good rice pudding."
421,HxC2ZN010NxAFwjTqUVpzw,2/24/2023,5 star rating,"When I first heard of rice pudding, in my mind I thought that it would taste horrible. But this restaurant, this place, is an example of ""You may like it if you try it"" I got myself a Banana Coconut Rice Pudding. And it was delightful. The environment was cozy and friendly. The employees were friendly and helpful when it comes to the choice of flavors. I highly recommend the Banana Coconut Rice Pudding. I enjoyed my stay. I couldn't help but chuckle out loud at the quotes that they have. I have taken photos of the ones that made me giggle. I find this to be my number one place for rice pudding. This is a good place for them to sell rice pudding... if you don't want that, you can have rice pudding, and if you don't want that, you can have rice pudding. I am definitely coming back. I will be telling my friends about this place."
422,HxC2ZN010NxAFwjTqUVpzw,7/2/2022,3 star rating,"The rice pudding here tastes better than it looks, but that's not saying much. I got the cheesecake and cookies and cream flavors. They were both pretty mediocre; they didn't really taste like the flavors as advertised, they were too sweet, and the pudding was too mushy for my liking. The cookies and cream one was better than the cheesecake one though. The portions are pretty large so I'd recommend sharing even their smallest size -- maybe if it was tastier I'd say otherwise. The decor of the shop is very interesting as they literally call you out for being fat and say that you're going to die soon so it doesn't matter if you eat a lot of calories. It's funny but a little uncomfortable given that these types of signs are all over the store. Regardless, I disagree with the sign; the pudding is not worth the calories because it is not that good."

Quite a clever concept, easily appetizing flavors and decent prices. I was initially skeptical of trying R2R as am not a big fan of rice based desserts. But one bite into their cheesecake flavor and I was instantly taken aback by its deliciousness. It's perfectly balanced taste wise - right amount sweet, creamy and fluffy rice enhance the texture of this amazing dessert.

426,HxC2ZN010NxAFwjTqUVpzw,10/22/2022,3 star rating,There are a total of 21 flavors of rice puddings. You walk into a very highly decorated place. The design of the storefront is very busy and bold. The owners must have studied a marketing class and figured out word of mouth and making a very pretty design is the best way to get customers in.This was another nice concept based on a very simple dessert. I do think that the cost is a little extreme for rice pudding (although the containers are reusable). They should give a discount for either return the containers or reusing the containers (similar Just Salad Reusable bowls).Also $2 for a little drizzle for toppings is not a great price either.Finally Customer Service is average.

430,RwFS9iF0fo9XrJuvduQdFg,7/15/2021,5 star rating,"Checked in last Sunday. Clean room, big bed, walk in shower and nice bathroom. It's close enough to multiple train stations such that you can get to most parts of the city relatively quickly and far enough from the bustle and chaos of Times Square. They provided 2 bottled waters on arrival and also had a hot water dispenser in the room (not that I used it). The bathroom had at least 3-4 towels, body wash, shampoo, and hair conditioner for your use. Oddly enough, they didn't have hand soap but that's relatively minor. The gym is all the way on the lowest level of the Hampton Inn and had a few treadmills, dumbbells, and a few other exercise equipment for resistance training. My only gripe is that they have two elevators (and a stairwell) to go up and down. If you are up at 6AM in the morning when nobody else is awake, you will get to the desired floor level in relatively quick speed. If you are checking out at 11:45 or so from the 20th floor (they have 21 accessible floors), the lack of elevators can become a hassle as you are competing with other hotel guests and housekeeping (who are cleaning up rooms that have been checked out) on your way down to the first floor which may mean waiting a little longer than you want to get on the elevator. Overall, good hotel for staying in Manhattan."

The ac wasn't too loud and the area seemed rather quiet to make sleep relatively easy. For New York, the room is pretty sizable and did not feel cramped.The breakfast dining area was fine, though I did not eat much here, save for some yogurt and fruit. However, the spread looked like the typical Hampton Inn offerings, with generic baked goods, waffle makers, eggs, and some breakfast meats, along with cereals and yogurts.The lobby is a bit small and it's crowded during check-in/check-out time. The staff was okay, though sometimes a little flighty and you just have to be a bit patient. However, the spa water and chocolate chip cookies were nice touches. Plus there is an area for coffee or tea for any time of the day. There area two (slow) elevators and one was broken at periods of time. So I often took the stairs."

I have stayed in many, including others located in Manhattan, but never encountered so many challenges as this hotel threw at me. First the good news. The staff was unfailingly polite and responsive, my wake up call was on the exact minute and my car to JFK arrived one minute early. Room was clean and in good order. Perfect. Unfortunately there were a number of problems with this hotel. First, there seemed to be only one elevator (out of two) operating or the other was in constant use for other reasons than for guests. Needless to say safe distancing was impossible. They did not request vaccination cards or masking at breakfast, a universal practice in NYC restaurants. The alarm clock in my room was defective, I was not able to set the alarm time. Upon arrival there was no internet service available (this lasted for hours) and for some odd reason Verizon wireless service is extremely weak at this location, so no hotspot. The landline phone in the room was difficult to figure out as you needed to initially use the speaker function in order to get a line. Finally, there was no guidance (oral or otherwise) concerning where the ice machine was located,  what time and where breakfast was served and other hotel services. Sorry to say, I would recommend against staying here if other options are available as these problems suggest poor management or oversight."

We were gone all day long and when we came back they had put a Happy Birthday greeting on our door and left a muffin and come cookies for us. I was blown away! We didn't expect that. The rooms are small like New York but very nicely decorated and clean. I've had much worse rooms and hallways at more expensive high end brands. Good water pressure. Free breakfast that isn't just bagels and doughnuts. Eggs, sausage, waffle bar etc etc. Really good and great to save on one meal in NYC! They stocked it quickly and dealt well with a crazy breakfast crowd. They had some free water with lemon in it in the lobby most times and even cookies at night. When we needed something like extra towels we had them immediately. So fast we didn't know they were at the door. LOLWhen we left for World Pride in our crazy makeup and costumes they took our pics and were excited for us. They had a few tables and chairs outside (not in the pics here) which were great to relax in. We ate breakfast there most mornings to avoid the crazy breakfast people.Conveniently located to Grand Central station with easy transfers all all locations like Times Square etc. It was nice after being in crowds and crazy NYC to be a little off the beaten path in some peace and quiet.

I would say that the prices are a little expensive. Not the type that'll break your bank BUT I would of thought it would at least come with sides you know. My flautas were good I didn't mind them. Good amount of chicken inside of them as well as the sauces on top were good. I also think that it should put at least come with sides. Some lettuce/sour cream/etc for the price. The margarita was good. I had the tamarindo one. My husband had the blueberry one. That one was ok. I would still try them again. He ordered the tacos. One pastor, one shrimp and one beef. He said that they were all delicious it would recommend the pastor since that was his favorite out of the 3. Service was good considering it was slow today (Saturday).

The salad comes in a tortilla bowl which is also edible. It has lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, cheese, pickles and jalenpenos. It only costs $6.00 and its definitely filling.

And after reading some of the reviews here, I want to say that the people who works in this location were very friendly to me and to my niece. They let us taste 4 different flavors before we decided which one to go with.It is a nice place with nice people. Maybe not the best ice cream in the world (which I think can only be found in Argentina), but definitely worth a visit."

This manager has no people skills, its no wonder he's never taking the orders, or speaking with customers. My boyfriend ordered a milkshake, we brought it to the car and realized something was off. It tasted funny, it tasted sour and just overall not good. I convinced my bf to go back inside and just let them know that something isn't right, hoping they would make it right. We've been customers here for years, we live nearby and never had a bad experience with their quality before. So when we brought it up, the manager straight denied anything was wrong, we suggested maybe the milk was rotten. So he took it out and tasted it himself.. he went through all that work just to prove nothing is wrong, and yet... our milkshake tasted wrong! It was a simple shake, a twist milkshake, nothing else in it. Very plain. How could one mess it up? You can't, unless the ingredients are rotten. In the end, i thought the manager was rude with no respect for his customers for not trying to make things right."

(My two faves - there is a god!) I am home recovering from an ankle injury/surgery so cooking is out of the question. I decided to treat myself using a Seamless gift card gifted to me and after searching multiple food options I decided on A Taste of Seafood. Since it was my first time trying it (or the flagship location) I rationalized to myself ""even if it's not very good, it technically isn't my money!"" Lol.I got two orders to hold me over for 2 days (although I was able to stretch everything out to 3 days!) The portion sizes were very generous - you definitely get your money's worth. More importantly, the fish and shrimp were cooked to perfection, the fried chicken was on point and the sides were very tasty- especially the baked mac & cheese and collard greens. The potato salad was a bit on the sweeter side for me, but by the second day it actually tasted better. (The ""leftovers"" effect, if you will.) I will definitely recommend A Taste of Seafood to my circle AND order from here again."

Tonight when I went into order my food since I recently moved nearby (this is really going to hurt my pockets ) and I was shocked. I never seen so many people that looks like me running the kitchen. It made me feel ecstatic. None of the extra unnecessary fake smiles that you tend to get in most establishments and also none of the rudeness that can happen either. Another thing I really appreciate is they've never messed up my order. I love it there. And having experience in the culinary field, I would love to work there too. But anyway.

However, I had to deduct 2 stars for their completely unacceptable packaging for takeout and delivery. I've never dined at the restaurant, only ordering delivery, so I cannot speak to the dine-in experience. My hot meals repeatedly came packaged in a thin, clear plastic clamshell container that is ONLY SUITABLE FOR COLD FOOD. What happens when you put hot food in such a container is that the plastic begins to soften and melt into your meal! I completely stopped ordering from them because of this and its a shame because its yummy and cheap. Plastic melting into ones meal is definitely a carcinogen though, so its a no-go."

Again I try to support ""Black owned small business "" and receive disappointment with this one."

I've been a longtime customer from way, way back in the days, when the restaurant was on the corner of 125 & Madison Ave...that place was literally a whole in hall with often a line outside the door and no one really complained about the wait time because you knew you would be eating good soon. Anyway, back to the food...it's good, pretty inexpensive with decent size portions: 4 jumbo shrimp, 2 pieces of fish & 2 sides is about $14. Trust me, you will be pleased and your belly will be full.

You have a person working the register touching dirty money and then she turns around and touches all the food in the bags with bare hands. The staff will pick at their weaves or braids or whatever. When they aren't doing anything, they pull out their cell phones and then go back to the food. -Chaos - This location seems to be the place where the neighborhood elderly hang out, the teenage thug wanna be's are here, kids running around, homeless people begging for money. -Mess - Half of the time one or more of the order taking kiosks are broken. Do the staff do anything about it? No. Or the machine is out of paper. Do they do anything? No. Oh ya, by the way, you have to order using a kiosk, even if you are paying with cash and then walk to a register where an annoyed woman takes your money and hands you a receipt. They are slow. You can be waiting forever. On their 'order' screen your number comes and goes while you still wait. -Rude - The staff here in general act like they are doing you a favor to serve you.

My partner and I really enjoy the Yogurt Rice drinks that have become popular in Asia and can only find options in Flushing.Our go to at Duomi is their Yangzi Yogurt drink which has a good combination of mango and pomelo with yogurt and sago. It's the ultimate fruit drink for fruity lovers. The wait is usually pretty long because the drinks are like smoothies and take a while to make, so definitely give yourself some time when purchasing a drink there. Overall, 4.5/5"
490,hTgz6L9PbB5f5fGF5lMWUA,4/8/2022,4 star rating,Been wanting to try this place a while and it was pretty good! I haven't had a yogurt drink like this before. I got both the Purple Rice Yogurt as well as the Red Beans Oats Yogurt. I definitely enjoyed the Purple Rice a lot more. The Red Bean one was a lot more tart if you're into that.The price is pretty steep at $6.50 per drink but it's a good healthier (than bubble tea probably) treat to have once in a while. It would be nice to know how much sugar is actually in these drinks. The cashier couldn't really speak English very well which was obviously not a problem but caused a bit of confusion when I brought up how the Red Bean (D4) drink was listed differently on their paper menu as opposed to the menu on the screen.

We've never had rice yogurt before, but found it to be refreshing, light, and not too sweet. A worthy (and apparently healthier) substitute for bubble tea. There was a pretty long line when we were there, but it moved  quickly and the staff was very efficient. I ordered the mango pomelo sago drink (mango-ey and refreshing) and she ordered the jujibe purple rice (tart, somewhat creamy, with pieces of purple rice in the drink, which I actually loved). The drinks aren't cheap - about $7 per - but they have good portion sizes. You can also customize ice and sugar levels. I would recommend!"

I sat outside for a few minute, open my laptop and within 10 min the same owner came outside, cut me off from the conversation I was having an someone else to tell me ""you can't use your laptop, no laptop, no wifi"" very rudely. When I said "" oh I don't need your wifi I have my own"" she proceeded to get even more rude and say ""I said no laptop or leave"". I then told her ""well that's weird"" and she got even snappier then decided to stand behind my table and watch me my entire visit and stand outside. She's probably watching me type this out because she was very adamant about NO WIFI - which is so sad because this place has potential to be a great working cafe.So needless to say, I will NOT be returning here and anyone who treats their employees like that does not deserve to own a business.

She is rude as can be, fake as can be, and she can't even hide how awful and disgusting she is.  Shameless, unrespectful and irate are some of the ways she greets  blacks customers who patronize her business and she treats her employees as if they were nothing. How dare she comes to Harlem with such atittude? Those are the people who are feeding her, putting money into her mouth and she has no consideration to the community that's is keeping her alive. The other day I stopped by for breakfast with a friend and I witnessed how enraged she is when a person of color comes to her joint - I was embarrassed by her disdain toward blacks and her staff. The way she acts and behaves is very conniving. I always try not to be judgmental but clearly the owner seems to be a racist big time. Her bigotry must be stopped! This joint's location is ok and the food is pricey and mediocre to say the least, and the portions are small and tasteless. Skip all the dead pastries and cakes and soggy breads.

I enjoyed their coffee as well.What struck me the most was how friendly the lady was. I believe she owns the cafe or she's just always there when I visit. But she was so sweet! I had a casual conversation with her and she ended up giving me a free soda. It was very sweet of her.This cafe has a very cute charm to it if you sit outdoors.

You don't expect for people like me to even have a Yelp account to vocalize miss treatment."

First they were NOT friendly you say hello ( and I said it in Spanish) they looked at me like I had two heads.I ordered 3 beef tacos for $7.50, On the menu it says ONIONS OR GUACAMOLE I placed the order at the bar and told one of the waitresses I was staying. I waited 1/2 and hour for 3 beef tacos ONLY (I was alone the place was empty only two men by the bar drinking at 12:30 PM)When I finally got my order they were (1) DRY as hell! Only meat and cilantro plus a few limes that they give you! (2) I asked where's the guacamole? The girl says there is none WTF?????? (3) They are cold the tacos the meat was cold!!! The corn outer shell we call tortas was cold!!!!NEVER AGAIN!!!I left NO tip see photos!!!! Stay away from this place! The girls are mean and rude! AND the BEST PART???? Ready for this they rushed me out! YES the mean girl came to me ask me if I was done could she remove the plate ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I was chewing my food!Worst place EVER!!!

They have a good size menu with plenty of options and seven days a week they have a ""lunch buffet."" Essentially, for $5-$7 (depending on the meat) you can choose from about a dozen options on their buffet cart for your plate. They also have happy hour options! Don't speak Spanish? They always have someone on staff that is bilingual.I've been here twice. Once I ordered from the menu: Bisteca y cebollas (steak and onions) and got a side of maduros (sweet plantains). The steak was excellently marinated and spiced and the onions were a great complement to the meal. It made two meals for me, because the portions were large. The maduros were soft, shiny, greasy, sweet, and tasty and just makes me drool thinking of them and the experience. Another time I ordered from their ""buffet."" I looked at what they had there and told my waitress that I wanted the rotisserie chicken, mixed rice, and maduros. Unfortunately they gave me tostones by accident, but I still enjoyed them. The chicken was tasty and enjoyable to the very last bite. Too much food meant leftovers again. The staff here is friendly, efficient, and is easily accessible. The restaurant never seems to be packed as most people do takeout or sit by the bar. You can get out of here for lunch for $5 or so and for dinner not much more than that. Expect large portions and takeaways."

I asked him can you deliver it, he said O we are busy at that time so just pick it up. I said OKAY then I will pick it up have the order ready by 11:45am so we can complete the transaction he said okay. I arrive at 11:45am and I ask for the order, they look at me like Im crazy and then I said I called it in like 3 days back. The guy said O yea I took your order but I didn't prepare it, I asked WHY? He said O I wasn't sure that you want it. I SAID What???? He said yea. I okay, okay can you prepare it now, he said we are very busy and cannot do it right now. I said Okay can you try he said I might be able to do just 1 platter which will feed like 8 people and mind you the meeting is for 30 people. I said Okay, you don't have to do it, but I would appreciated it if you would of called me and informed me what was going on, the guy just looked at me as if he didn't care.

I was told my order would be given to me in 22 seconds. Very specific right? So I said okie doke. I didn't realize that I would be made in that 22 seconds because my sandwich looked a mess. It was burnt and half of the sandwich bread was nowhere to be found. The salad I ordered was super dry...no dressing found. Panera on Adams we gotta do better. For real, for real."

I've never seen this at this location before. COVID can't be blamed for service. I ate my cookie as I waited in a little corner. The manager was pacing the floor looking angry and everyone that asked him a question he scowled like he had regrets about being at work that day. I laughed and said this guy is a nut. You can look at his staff and see they were afraid of him. He rules with an iron fist. I asked him for a refund and he gave me back my money. I told him I ate the cookie and he said that's fine. Because his tone was different when I requested a refund I walked away smiling. God knows I wanted to contact corporate on him for his TONE which I heard with my own ears.

By the way, he was snapping at anybody that asked him a question...He answered, with an attitude,  that I needed to wait still and to speak to the lady in the front.  3 minutes later, my name disappeared from the screen.  I went to one of the ladies in the front, the first one ignored my question. The other lady in the front, with a nasty attitude as well, told me that there is nothing she could do. Finally,  I got annoyed and went back and told the manager how ridiculous this was.   He got really passed and went to the back, and guess what, there is a bag with my soup.   Had i not asked and showed them I was annoyed, I probably would still be there. 50 minutes to get a soup and a bagel!!!!Needless to say, this was my last time patronizing this place.   Zero in customer service. Maybe they don't want to spend money hiring qualified employees with a better attitude.  Never again. Corporate should pay a visit to this place."
539,LPgX8syJ79eFTCEAJHffLQ,2/24/2021,2 star rating,"I've been to this location several times, mainly for coffee. Whenever you order coffee through their ordering terminals, the people preparing the food ignore the order until you wait for several minutes, even if there are no other outstanding orders, and ask them to hand you the cup. It's self-serve so it's not as though they have to pour it. The most recent time I went, I ordered a cup of the dark roast. They eventually gave me the cup, but when I went to the coffees, everything was empty except light roast. So I filled my cup with light roast. While I was walking to work and drinking the coffee, about two thirds of the way into the coffee my mouth filled with coffee grounds. Not just a few coffee grounds like when some of them accidentally get in while brewing, but more like a whole scoop of coffee grounds that all went into my mouth at once. It was disgusting and even after a ton of spitting onto the sidewalk, my mouth still had a ton of these grounds in them. I had to walk for a while before I managed to walk by a bodega where I could buy juice and wash the grounds out. It was such an unpleasant experience, worse than it sounds."

Staff is friendly and doesn't take too long to pick up order except during the height of lunch at times. Dining inside - there is seating upstairs after you pick up your order. Bagels are ok - tried many of them and still favor the cinnamon raisin and the cranberry walnut. This location you still can get preserves for free as Manhattan locations charges 50 cents plus tax.Pastries have changed and gotten smaller - usually get the bear claw now since the pecan braid has shrunk.

While everything related to this establishment is generally mediocre, this past visit was horrendous. The staff is consistently rude and unhelpful (so I generally use the electronic kiosks, of which one is always broken/out of service. The food preparers nearly always miss an item, to the extent that if I amtaking out food, It must be thoroughly checked before leaving.  When you ask for the missing item, the response is either ""sorry we were out of that"" or they just say ""here!""This location has a convenient upstairs area with an abundance of tables and seating. Yet, the tables and cushions are ALWAYS dirty. Further, if you thought you could sit down and eat your food AND ALSO speak to someone or read something, think again--The music is blasting!  Lastly, the floor is just so dirty, it's nauseating to look at. Now let's get to the food. I don't expect much from food that comes out of plastic bags, but at least get the ingredients right. I ordered the steak and arugula half sandwich (picture attached). The bread was soggy, the ingredients were not neatly packed into the sandwich, the steak was not edible (mostly tough pieces with cartilage or some other inedible part of the steak), and they didn't even use arugula-- not living up to the sandwich's eponymous name! There are so many other places to eat around here that it's truly not worth the money to step into this establishment. Did I mention that half the people are not even eating Panera in there!"

Atmosphere is lively, there are plenty of seats to pick from, and there is a spacious and clean bathroom in the back.

This is a little dessert spot located inside the Plaza Food Hall (along with a TON of other eateries to try). They make VERY small donuts, which you can get customized and top with an assortment of options. I bought a dozen and was able to pick four different toppings. You should plan to eat these right away when they are warm as they will get hard if you save them for later (they reheat okay). The flavors sounded pretty good but aren't as obvious when you're eating them. For instance, a few of mine got mixed up and I couldn't distinct the flavors at all. Note, they are pretty small but I guess that helps portion control for those of us who have a sweet tooth :)For the size, they are definitely overpriced (I think it came out to a little more than a $1 per donut) but it's something to try once or take a friend to while visiting Central Park. You can buy a few and walk around and explore the rest of the Plaza while munching away! I probably won't go again but glad I tried it once.

Oh so many flavors but we ended up trying , fruity pebble , cinnamon , vanilla frosted and the banana monkey one? I believe that was the name but all were so yummy. My favorite had to be the vanilla frosted with sprinkles , I highly recommend that one. There are seats and tables available around the food court. We will back soon to try all the other flavors you have to offer :) Happy yelping and satisfy that sweet tooth !"

This is a little dessert spot located inside the Plaza Food Hall (along with a TON of other eateries to try). They make VERY small donuts, which you can get customized and top with an assortment of options. I bought a dozen and was able to pick four different toppings. You should plan to eat these right away when they are warm as they will get hard if you save them for later (they reheat okay). The flavors sounded pretty good but aren't as obvious when you're eating them. For instance, a few of mine got mixed up and I couldn't distinct the flavors at all. Note, they are pretty small but I guess that helps portion control for those of us who have a sweet tooth :)For the size, they are definitely overpriced (I think it came out to a little more than a $1 per donut) but it's something to try once or take a friend to while visiting Central Park. You can buy a few and walk around and explore the rest of the Plaza while munching away! I probably won't go again but glad I tried it once. They also sell coffee but beware, the Plaza is usually crowded with tourists or by the corporate crowd during lunch/HH time."

He loves the cake bun, so our group all had to try it. It's exactly what it sounds like, a piece of cake wrapped in a bun. The cake has condensed milk on the inside so it's a bit sweeter while the bun on the outside adds some firmness. There were a bunch of other pastries that you typically would find at a Chinese bakery, but I didn't order any of them. Place is very compact and narrow. Cash only."

(I still walk pass it and return to find the front door sometimes these days XD)Over 30 years of business in the heart of busy Flushing, there must be more than one good reason! They are one of few oldest bakeries sell authentic Taiwanese stuffs. There are meat buns, veggie buns, Asian style milk custard buns, toasts, cakes, milk tea, and other delicious pastries and other sweet buns. I recommend milk custard bun. The sweet hinted crust fused with soft raisins, together with inside the enriched milk custard when you bite down, flavor so solid making me see cows... Best go with black coffee!They sell nigiri rice balls in tuna and pork flavors.  Tuna has hint of spicy, which I find it helps appetite without over spicy. Both types of rice balls are good, and with reasonable price.There are few Chinese festivals in a year. And in each festival we celebrate with different pastries and food. Autumn Festival we have pastries in moon shape (round), and Dragon-boat Festival we eat rice and meat wrapped in bamboo leaves, ... Apollo offers these festivals year round.They have these delicacies in the daily basis!I have to say they did a great job keeping the food quality consistent.

It was as if my sweet Chinese step-grandmother (that I don't have) baked all these breads for me with her love. They have a lot of the typical pastries that you would come to expect (like shengkee) and a few cool cakes that were unique. I would definitely come back.It's cash only, and a very small establishment.OrderedCake bread with condensed milk - pretty cool bread/cake hybrid with a sweet kick.

He loves the cake bun, so our group all had to try it. It's exactly what it sounds like, a piece of cake wrapped in a bun. The cake has condensed milk on the inside so it's a bit sweeter while the bun on the outside adds some firmness. There were a bunch of other pastries that you typically would find at a Chinese bakery, but I didn't order any of them. Place is very compact and narrow. Cash only."

They are one of few oldest bakeries sell authentic Taiwanese stuffs. There are meat buns, veggie buns, Asian style milk custard buns, toasts, cakes, milk tea, and other delicious pastries and other sweet buns. I recommend milk custard bun. The sweet hinted crust fused with soft raisins, together with inside the enriched milk custard when you bite down, flavor so solid making me see cows... Best go with black coffee!They sell nigiri rice balls in tuna and pork flavors.  Tuna has hint of spicy, which I find it helps appetite without over spicy. Both types of rice balls are good, and with reasonable price.There are few Chinese festivals in a year. And in each festival we celebrate with different pastries and food. Autumn Festival we have pastries in moon shape (round), and Dragon-boat Festival we eat rice and meat wrapped in bamboo leaves, ...

Although it's a bit on a smaller portion, it did keep me full throughout the work day. I had their tofu drunken noodle. I did it as medium spicy but it was not spicy at all. If you want spicy, (and can handle spice) maybe it's best to do it as spicy instead of medium? Unless they accidentally made mine mild. Their Thai iced tea was good, their Thai iced coffee was too sweet for my liking. The spring rolls were good as well. Crunchy and flavorful. Free delivery and they deliver really fast.

Waitress returned $3 and took a $5 tip without my consent which is ridiculous. I tipped her more than 5 dollars but the pettiness had to be noted. On top of the $5 dollars that she took for her self I gave her $2 and change. She received $7+ even though she didn't deserve it. It's a fake Thai restaurant. The food is pretty week. The very small chicken wings were regular breaded wings American style. The sweet chili sauce is like watered down to the max. Pretty bad experience. Save your money. The funny thing was the waitress asked if we wanted change like the food was amazing or something when we handed her the money and got shortchanged. There's better Thai food a couple blocks away.

He makes ordering your lunch the most intimidating experience. Dare to ask a question or even ask how many ingredients you have left and he will immediately snap at you. I do acknowledge that he is very efficient which could be the reason Cafe R keeps him but I know Cafe R lost my business which is the equivalent of $2,880 (based on daily consumption of a large salad for most work days with a drink).

True story, the owners were part of a team - together they opened the first ""Jook-Fun-Mein"" eats right in Bensonhurst - what was called the OG ""86 Wong"" on 86th Street & Bay Parkway.  They were the first of its kind in this Italian hood and made a killing, until their fierce competitor Fu-Kee opened across from them.  Then the business struggled with internal conflicts and those damn DOH grades! ""Mo' Money, Mo' Problems""... the owners parted ways and apparently split the staffs too. So now you have ""New 86 Wong"" on Bay Parkway and ""Han Wong"" on 20th Avenue.  If you listen carefully when they answer the phone... it sounds like they both claim the name of ""Sun Yue Wong""... ;) OK - food is decent here, certain dishes are better than others - they make a killer ""salted fish/eggplant with dice chicken"" clay pot! Also the roasted garlic chicken (better than the traditional crispy chicken. (Dine In).  For take-outs, my goto are the roast meats! Their roast pork is better than Fu-Kee (yes! I think so!), and I like when they make the baby suckling pigs! Not too salty! The service is much better than its competitors! The owner is so nice to his customers and he makes it a point to say ""Hi"" to loyal customers... it feels homely... :) IMHO - I like Han Wong over the rest... including Kings Kitchen... except for the claypot rice & maybe the curry squid (somehow Kings Kitchen got me hooked!). #happyfoodhunting"

We had a large bowl of congee, lobster noodles, roast pork with rice, fresh steamed ginger scallion fish, fish fillet with black bean and string beans, and Peking style pork chop. All that for $49?!

This location is not as convenient for me, but I will come here instead of Fu Kee for the roast pork over rice with a fried egg. The egg this still runny when I get home with this place and there's that fried egg taste that you really only get from a Chinese restaurant wok lolI'll be back!"
671,X5wTIxiKmRk-dd1bjRLBfA,2/23/2020,5 star rating,I would definitely come to this place more than once. The  lobster dish was delicious and all the other dishes as well.

672,X5wTIxiKmRk-dd1bjRLBfA,3/5/2018,5 star rating,"I came here with my family this past weekend for a late/early birthday dinner and Chinese New Year celebration. Since we all lived in Brooklyn, we figured this restaurant is the most ideal.We also heard great reviews from our in laws so we decided to try this place out.We had to call ahead and reserve a table since we were a big group and we were going to get the Alaskan King Crab. When we arrived, we were seated right away. Our table was set up right in front of us.We were given the menu quickly and our tea. However, it was hard flagging down our waiter here and there since we barely knew where he went half the time. They brought out the crab for us to take pictures with (they suggested this, not us) and it was quite funny seeing everyone take pictures with it. The crab came in at over 8 lbs which is small for Alaskan King crabs. Anyways, as they took the crab away, the waiter started bringing out our dishes. We ordered a soup with some tofu and veggies, noodles, 2 vegetable dishes, fish, duck and the king crab. We could have ordered more dishes but I don't really remember. The king crab was cooked PERFECTLY! It wasn't salty or ""fishy"" tasting and was extremely fresh. My mom enjoyed it so much, I'm pretty sure she ate a pound or two of it. I would recommend coming here if you're in the area. Even though the service wasn't up to par (at least in the beginning, which I understand because it was rush hour) it got a lot better once the restaurant died down and everyone left. I would also come back here again because everything was extremely affordable as well!"

However, the graffiti in the bathroom did not for some reason (RIP). Drinks were still great, but you do still have to buy a cracker or some shit to have a drink. I'm not sure if that's even still a rule but they're definitely doing it last time I went (about a month ago). Great to see them survive. Few big changes: Table service now , it's cleaner , you need to sign in with your info. Still the dopest bar in the East Village."

We thought they didn't survive the pandemic!On our first night back, our bill was unusually high even though we only had two drinks each. We thought maybe they just gave us top shelf tequila or something, so we didn't think much more about it.The second time we came back, my friend paid the bill but also noticed it was a bit high for what we ordered. This evening, we ordered two well drinks and three beers. The server told us the well drinks were $8 each and the beer was $7 each. So... 16+21=37 right? When I closed out, she only gave me the credit card receipt, for which the charge was $45! I was a bit tipsy at the time so I didn't do the math at that point and gave her a 20% tip. I don't want to accuse anyone of wrongdoing without knowing their intention, but it seems like even with taxes, the pre-tip charge should not have been that high. There was no mention that gratuity (or a Covid recovery fee) had been added. We will not be coming back."

When I was younger, I wanted to expand my divebar love and headed to DDS across the street. I instantly felt unwelcomed and left.8 years later, my friend and I are doing a Christmas crawl, and he suggest DDS. I begrudgingly say yes.All ratings of this place are warranted because it's KING dive bar. It's an absolute pile of shit but it embraces itself, and is exactly what it wants it to be.If you're looking for a real dive bar, skip out on Lucy's and just head here. The place is pretty big and even has a backyard. They're a bunch of tvs that play weird things -- usually niche porn (Japanese BDSM, Little people) and vintage porn.The seats are sticky, and the back area smells strongly of piss. The bathrooms are truly disgusting and don't have locks that work all the time.Beer are cheaper if you pay in cash. Bartenders have a ""fuck you"" attitude.It's dressed up to be a punkrock bar, but I think the spirit of punk, punk rock, and metal have left long time ago."

I've been to LA and LV kind of clubs using pornography to provide a hedonistic atmosphere, but this place was essentially a pool bar with porn on the TVs. I won't return or recommend somebody go because it was such a terrible atmosphere, and I don't want people to view me negatively after their visit.

She was passive aggressive and decided right after we placed an order to take out a prop and do some kind of skit. Seriously.. you're going to take out a whip?? The act was tasteless and uncomfortable to watch and completely killed my mood. The thoughts running through my head during this was W T F. I immediately knew I just had to leave this place and will not spend anymore money in this establishment. Who in the right mind would treat their customers like they're garbage. Every interaction she had with customers was an opportunity for her to make some sort of nasty comment. This place is a hard NO from me. Save your money and spend it elsewhere."

The spot is absolutely perfect for a quick lunch, with convenient seamless kiosks right when you walk in. They were super easy to order from! Once your order is ready, a worker would call out the name you inputted. You would also receive a text message since you left your phone number. There's plenty of seating, both indoor and outdoor! Utensils and water are self serve.The Hawashis looked so harmless and flat on the outside, but they really pack a punch on the inside! You really have to eat these fresh! My boyfriend's Spicy Hawashi ($9.50) was hotter than mine. As a result, the beef patty was extra tender with the heat, and the peppers were a great complement. The spice can get to you the more you eat!The Cheese Hawashi ($10.50) had more ingredients and was so so fresh! With arugula, corn, and tomatoes, the inside was like looking into a rainbow. Not to mention, they tasted delicious intertwined with the stringy cheese!The Dukka Fries ($4.75) were super fluffy, and coated in the housemade spice blend really well. The Tahina, our choice of sauce, didn't taste like anything to me, but was simply grainy. For my first dive into Egyptian food, I am impressed by Zooba! With fresh selections, plentiful seating, and advanced kiosks, they have gotten me excited to try more of their other food options!"

Why is one girl behind the counter wearing gloves and a hairnet but this short girl with glasses not wearing ANY of those things, while working with FOOD?!? I ended up not eating what we ordered and gave it to the homeless and I just drank the hibiscus limeade which was HORRIBLE, medicinal sweet syrup and the Mint limeade tasted weird. Then I see that same girl with the disgusting long nails getting someone's drink ready and her fingers were deep in the plastic cups, I got so grossed out I just dumped the rest of my drink. What a shame, when a place doesn't care about hygiene and cleanliness it's a HUGE turn off, we won't be going there again."
687,euqvuleuiGyMffTR23eeYg,5/9/2022,4 star rating,"Zooba is a breath of fresh air for those who eat healthy, don't always have the time to cook, and don't want to eat Chipotle everyday. Zooba is my initiation to Egyptian street food and I was excited to try it without paying a huge price in case I didn't like it (which is usually not the case). When you first walk in you can either order at the counter or at a digital kiosk. A kiosk was open so my boyfriend and I decided to order a cheese hawawshi, spicy hawawshi, an Egyptian grilled cheese, dukka fries with pickled lemon sauce, a mint limeade and a hibiscus limeade. The place was packed on a Saturday afternoon and people started to trickle out after the 12-1pm lunch rush. Luckily for us, this meant we could snag a table for ourselves. My favorite item that I ordered was the spicy hawawshi which was sweet, mildly spicy, and super flavorful. The texture is perfect with a slightly crispy bread and saucy interior. The carrot slaw  and the beef patty are married together in perfect matrimony of sweet and salty goodness. The sandwich is great with the mint limeade that provides a sweet and refreshing finish.The cheese hawawshi tasted more like a standard sandwich but still had middle eastern elements that differentiated this sandwich. It's a tasty sandwich I would get if I want a lighter meal.The dukka fries are thick cut and are nicely seasoned. The pickled lemon sauce with the fries was good.The Egyptian grilled cheese is very unique with a blend of cheese and olives. It's a combination I haven't tried aside from having olives on pizza and I was pleasantly surprised. The taste is something that catches you off guard if you're not used to a strong olive taste but it grew on me the more I ate it. I wouldn't get this unless I was in the mood for it though.Overall, I would come back for the spicy hawawshi and try some other menu items. Tasty food at an affordable price? I'm always down."
688,euqvuleuiGyMffTR23eeYg,6/10/2022,5 star rating,"4.5/5Zooba is definitely a fast-food establishment. The order is taken via kiosk but you can order at the counter as well. The establishment has amazing branding and the music slaps. The servers seem chill and it's a good vibe. We order the Sandwich, fries, and a Salad with some Spicy Hawawshi and Hibiscus Beetroot Tahina. I didn't taste much difference between the sauces which was disappointing. The sandwiches are a good size for one and the salad was big enough for us to have some leftovers even if I was really hungry. The fries didn't feel that especially but were a good compliment to everything else. I would like to point out that most orders were for takeout which might be the reason for the seats and tables not being that clean. Overall it's a good place to order delivery from or grab it to go."
689,euqvuleuiGyMffTR23eeYg,5/2/2022,5 star rating,"Zooba definitely takes fast casual to the next level. Their interior is fun and feels more like a place to sit and enjoy your food than most other fast casual restaurants. I love their open windows in the front, it makes for great people watching. It's also nice that they have a few good beers on tap for anyone interested in adding a beverage. It's very casual and your ordering is done through a kiosk. There's a kitchen in the center to grab your food when it's ready and seating in a dining area and at the kitchen counter. As for the food, my husband and I loved it. We had the Cheese Hawawshi and the Badawi Beef Bowl with salad as the base. The flavors on both were so good. We will definitely be returning!"
690,euqvuleuiGyMffTR23eeYg,5/8/2022,4 star rating,"I've been here a few times but the last time was a while back. This is as most other people note an Egyptian fast food joint but the food quality here is anything but fast food. They have a cool inside with some Arabic graffiti and the staff is nice. My favorite thing is the hawawshi which is a beef and vegetable patty. My preference is the spicy version which came with orange-carrot slaw, tahina, and sweet harissa sauce. The spicy sauce had a nice kick to it and there were some fruits of some type in it which added some freshness.The Badawi beef consisting of slow-cooked beef with pickled beets, hot peppers, pickled lemon sauce, and hibiscus tahina was also good with a good mix of flavors, While the portion size of the beef was a little bit small, it was tender and it went well with everything else. The vermicelli rice; most well known from their national dish Koshari which I haven't had yet from here; was of course tasty and the sauces were good.I have gotten a side of the taameya which is the Egyptian take on falafel and it is made of fava beans instead of chickpeas. They have a bit more of a grainy texture and I slightly prefer the latter for this reason but I can imagine it goes well in a sandwich (and they did go well with the pickled lemon sauce.) For other sides, the dukka fries I tried from someone were excellent which the bessara was a bit bland outside of the chickpeas on top which added texture. The Egyptian style mixed pickles are not as recommended as a side unless you just want to have a little bit more spice as it's a bit pricey for what it is.In terms of sauces, the harissa raisin and pickled lemon are easily my favorite with the pickled lemon being something that I am very accustomed to from other Middle Eastern spots. The beetroot tahina is a bit bland but it's looks pretty and the hot sauce is good as noted. For drinks, the hibiscus limeade is perfectly fine and they have a good little selection of beers as well as wine. My preferred Egyptian soft drink is Fayrouz but they don't have it here. Good spot."
691,euqvuleuiGyMffTR23eeYg,6/11/2022,5 star rating,"Really enjoyed this!! While I can't speak to authenticity (not Egyptian) but as many cool and new places pop up around the city I would def revisit this spot and proudly show it to my friends visiting the city.CHEESE HAWAWSHIThe bread is pita-like but crisp, a bit of a crunch, thin like a pita but not pillowy soft; like a shell. It's got a nice wheat-like flavor and the meat is thoroughly seasoned, fragrant and flavorful with the melty cheese, refreshing arugula. Not super greasy like other burgers and def represents the lesser known Egyptian seasonings/flavors that lie in the meat. Harissa sauce is not too spicy , could even be spicier but not too mild.FALAFELI was taught that good falafel crumbles easily and is richly green inside. While I've had better falafel i enjoyed that these were coated with sesame seeds and the inside had whole herbs as pictured. EL AROSA ICED TEA Not too sweet and so refreshing, has this sort of herbal taste that if you're familiar with the Chinese drink Wong lo Kat, it's somewhat reminiscent of that. Hard to find something like this elsewhere!"

Hawawshi sandwich comes in different flavors, the cheesy one does not skimp on the cheese and is pressed upon order.The spicy falafel sandwich is still haunting my dreams (in a good way) I will definitely be back for this dish, mainly! The spicy sauce is perfectly tangy and hot. The sandwich is packed to the brim and the falafel is cooked perfectly, super fresh.They have a limited selection of craft beers, which complements the meal perfectly. Hummus and fries are perfect for sharing and not to miss.Will be back."

I have been a very frequent customer for years and I have just become too fed up with there rising prices and total lack of caring for any complaints from customers. I wanted to use a coupon that they give with the menu and they denied me the right because although I did order 10$ of food, since I had ordered three sodas and 1 plate of food, they told me I couldn't use it. The coupon didn't state anything about a requirement other than it couldn't be a lunch special. I ordered this evening at 9:30pm. I really feel that I will no longer put my hard earned money into a business that has there interest in making money before supporting the people that have the power to make them successful. I'm sick of the lack of respect and feel that this sort of treatment would never be given to me if they were located downtown. I'm sure they will be forced to change how they deal with customers if they ever plan on being successful when this neighborhood becomes more heavily gentrified. Competition will move in and rent will get higher. Then they will need us customers. Sad facts, and I won't tolerate this anymore."

The service was so amazing - the servers were explained to us the history of the restaurant, gave us great overviews of the dishes and drinks and overall so attentive during our meal. The dress code is definitely more formal than casual (we felt a bit underdressed) so be prepared. Definitely a place that has regulars and it makes sense why. In addition to the service, the food was a cherry on top. The bread and butter maybe isn't necessary, but it was a classic way to start the meal. I got the steak and my boyfriend got the lobster and both were so delicious. The steak was cooked to the perfect medium rare and with shallots together, it was such a rich flavor bomb. The lobster was so tender and with the pasta was so amazing. The desserts were also great, but I was so enamored with the main dishes. Also, the presentation of the dishes was beautiful. Everything was worthy of that Michelin star here and I definitely want to come back :)"

While far better than the second iteration and the new -- lighter and brighter -- decor is excellent, I sadly must come to the conclusion that Gotham without Alfred Portale is simply not Gotham. While executive chefs come and go at many great restaurants, Portale was the executive chef from day one at Gotham Bar & Grill and he stayed for 35 years. So now, no Portale, no Gotham. To its credit, the food is nice, as are the cocktails. The service is great. This is a terrific neighborhood restaurant, in a great neighborhood, but no longer a destination restaurant."

It was as fabulous as it's ever been, and our wonderful and thoughtful server Maria made it a special night to remember."

779,wejLjvNQxkVfV4OGgMXgog,7/13/2021,5 star rating,"- came on a saturday at peak dinner time without a reservation and was seated at the bar- ordered their signature t-bone for 2 (approx $48 pp), came out perfectly rare/medium rare, wonderful marbling throughout, so flavorful and very tender, one of the best steaks I've had in years (better than Charles Prime, Peter Lugar, Palm, etc), came with creamed spinach and choice of potato EACH, so we ordered the fried potatoes (aka french fries) and mashed potatoes, highly recommend getting both-  can't remember what the name of the wine was but it was the only cab blend they had by the glass and it paired with the steak very well- it took us almost an hour to get our order in but the bartender was up to her ears in customers so totally understandable and it's not like we were in any rush - I'm kicking myself for not coming sooner, it's been added to the regular rotation, we're going to make it a once a month stop"

The jalasco sauce may be overwhelming for some so request it on the side. Besides the celebrity sandwiches they have salads and wraps ect , something for everyone. The workers are polite and fast! They offer delivery, pickup and an app ordering as well."

It came out with pesto- which I am allergic to. I asked if it was pesto and he told me yes- and I pointed out it wasn't supposed to have it...that it was supposed to have just basil. We then had the most ridiculous exchange where he told me I didn't know what basil was and that pesto was in fact basil and I should just take the sandwich. At this point I accepted I couldn't get my sandwich fixed and took a refund."

Definitely needed a break and a pick me up. This monstrous sandwich more than sufficed.I walked in and was immediately greeted by the deli man behind the counter. He was incredibly helpful in crafting my custom made sandwich, down to the toasting of the entire sub -- something I have not had during my time in NYC. I ordered a pepper mill turkey sandwich on sesame seeded bread with lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, mustard, and hot oil, all toasted like a panini. This sandwich came with a free side of macaroni pasta and I also threw in a mixed greens large salad because, why not? This sandwich was so fire, the perfect amount of mayo and hot oil to create an irresistibly creamy and satisfying mixture with the turkey. Yum.Unfortunately, I couldn't eat ALL of this in one sitting and ended up munching through dinner and lunch of the following day. A superb deal for a one stop shop. All under $20. Super impressed by the selection of sandwiches, deli meats, and appetizers. I've been back at least 3 times in the past 3 weeks and don't see this new ritual stopping anytime soon.One star off because I've come a couple times requesting for the entire sandwich to be toasted to the perfection that it was the first time and each time they have forgotten. Next time..."

Their sandwiches are topped high and they go heavy on the sauce, so mind that. Their menu is really overwhelming, but honestly, everything is good. I love the Cyber Sex sandwich. The burgers are on the dry side, so I'd stray away from those. The service is nice and efficient."

The lady at the counter was very friendly. I ordered everything to go. I got a blueberry and cream cookie, birthday cake truffles and a slice of the birthday cake. I got the cookie for my daughter. I tried it and didn't think it was anything special but she enjoyed it. The birthday cake truffles were also nothing special. The slice of birthday cake was actually pretty good, but still far from the best I ever had. Overall, I found everything to be pretty average. The prices are not as bad as I would expect, I paid around $20 for all that. But I think I would try somewhere different next time I go to New York."

Not sure if it just wasn't fresh or if they've changed the recipe but I didn't think it was as good as the last time I had it. Not worth the $$$$Plus the 8-10 was a bit small. There was 6 of us and we had smaller pieces but there was no leftover. The service was fast though.
796,u4VGf3gIEtNx6_35cilQLA,2/22/2021,4 star rating,Glad to be able to get a warm baked cookie even during covid. The restaurant/seating area isn't open but you can order through the window. Within a few minutes you can have a warm treat handed to you through the glass. They sell a lot of their merchandise here too. The blueberry and white chocolate cookie wasn't my favorite. They're definitely known better for their confetti or compost cookie- and it's so much better than the box they sell at target!

""We don't change online orders"". Okay.Son said the pie was delicious. Cookie and truffles were average. For $15 it's not much and not really worth it."

799,u4VGf3gIEtNx6_35cilQLA,3/20/2022,2 star rating,"I'm also in the same boat of having wanted to try their birthday cake and was... disappointed. I do think they have the art of a standard cake down, nothing too moist nor dry. It was just a birthday cake slice and nothing more. You're probably better off buying the birthday cake mix from Betty Crocker or just boxed brands and making it yourself. The frosting was interesting, it was buttermilk like but it wasn't anything so special that it sold the cake. Additionally the cakes crunchy elements were interesting but once again, not a seller. Would not recommend, though if you're a curious soul, try it because you probably just need to get it out of your system."
800,u4VGf3gIEtNx6_35cilQLA,2/8/2022,2 star rating,"I was enjoying a night in and decided to order some sweet treats. I bought the sample pack where you get a slice of pie, three of the truffle balls, the cereal milk ice cream and a cookie. I paid $25 not including tip, tax or delivery. The slice of pie was really flat and thin, and the truffle balls were tiny. The cookie and ice cream were a good size. Unfortunately I didn't like any of it. As other reviewers have noted it was all really sweet and the texture of everything was very dense, sticky and wet. Like dessert cement.  The Compost cookie was okay but not any better or worse than a cookie you could get at a supermarket. I had never heard of Milk Bar before, it just popped up in my TryCaviar recommendations, but I was so disappointed that I found them on Yelp to leave this review."

Yes the pho is still served in a paper bowl for now and the utensils are disposable, but I'm sure that will change with time as Coronavirus becomes less severe. Don't be afraid to stop in for lunch or dinner if you are in the area and looking for somewhere to sit down for pho. The rib eye pho was excellent and the indoor vibes are not bad at all. It felt warm and cozy. If you are very hungry definitely get the ""big bowl"" of pho for an extra $3. I would absolutely come back here if I were in the area, and probably order take out.

831,Jh6wMPv4IK9jUpWMGj4J9g,2/4/2022,5 star rating,"I know this operates mostly as a take-out restaurant right now (February 2022) but you can still dine in. I had a great experience eating in today. Yes the pho is still served in a paper bowl for now and the utensils are disposable, but I'm sure that will change with time as Coronavirus becomes less severe. Don't be afraid to stop in for lunch or dinner if you are in the area and looking for somewhere to sit down for pho. The rib eye pho was excellent and the indoor vibes are not bad at all. It felt warm and cozy. If you are very hungry definitely get the ""big bowl"" of pho for an extra $3. I would absolutely come back here if I were in the area, and probably order take out. But dining in for pho is by far my favorite choice.The fact that this restaurant is open 24/7 is absolutely incredible."

836,Jh6wMPv4IK9jUpWMGj4J9g,10/17/2022,3 star rating,Solid 24/7 spot for pho delivery. Like the other reviews say - double up on the meat if you're hungry. Came to eat once inside - the food definitely shines better when you can enjoy it in the comfort of your own home. I always order from here either as a backup to my regular spot in crown heights / prospect heights or when I'm at bf's who lives down the street.
837,Jh6wMPv4IK9jUpWMGj4J9g,8/17/2022,1 star rating,"If I can leave a ZERO for this place... I would. I've had chicken pho in many restaurants so ordering one would have expectations. Let me start off with something simple. I ordered their coffee, which is amazing but I ordered a large (valued at $8.00) and what I received was 3/4 of a cup and mostly filled with ice. Secondly, I order a chicken pho. Just by looking at it, it looked pretty pathetic to be called Vietnamese. The amount of noodles is for a child, the chicken wasn't even a whole breast, it looked like it was 5 shredded strips. They added cilantro, which I've never had in a pho, but the amount was beyond measures... not even for a Mexican dish. It was completely destroyed and I ended up throwing it out. What a waste of money. Furthermore, let's end it with the staff. I walked in for this order and even with trying to say hello loudly, I was ignored for 10 minutes. Horrible in all aspects. Don't bother with this place."

Honestly wanted to like the place more than I did but some things turned me off about it. The inside looked like it was dressed up to be a nice cocktail bar and the outside had a completely different vibe so it threw me off. The service was super duper slow, and the place was mostly empty. The beer selection, however was quite decent though they were out of a bunch of beers.I think the place is a bit of an odd gem that's a cool neighborhood spot but nothing I'd ever seek out. I'm curious to see what it's like on a busier night."
842,ND97mueQmRiUKiN3HZ4vcA,3/4/2020,5 star rating,"Great new addition to the neighborhood. It's a giant space (that used to be Half Court), with the bar area and then a whole other seating space. Lots of seating, and they have board games!Their cocktail selection is pretty solid, but they were pretty overwhelmed by how crowded it already was a few weeks after opening. I guess word spreads quickly!They also have a very respectable beer menu, so swing by for some delicious fancy crafts.Good place to bring a date or a smaller group! Or Mitch E."
843,ND97mueQmRiUKiN3HZ4vcA,3/6/2021,5 star rating,"We've spent a lot of time here due to its proximity during the pandemic, and it's easily the best bar in the neighborhood. They have a strong rotating selection of local craft beer and reasonably priced cocktails. The casual, no-frills food menu is consistently good and very affordable. I particularly enjoy the soft pretzel with beer cheese and the BTLP (bacon, tomato, lettuce and pepperoncini on ciabatta). The decor inside is warm and inviting - just like the service - and Vincente and Noé (spelling?) are standouts for their friendliness and attentiveness."
844,ND97mueQmRiUKiN3HZ4vcA,2/20/2020,5 star rating,"Having finally done something with the old Half Court space (it was a sports bar) The Barlow gives you a full court press, with tons of reasons to come back. The space is nice. Large cocktail bars are nice. There's lots of room in this dimly lit joint. There's couches for a group. Small tables that are perfect for a date. And a nice sized bar   The people working here are friendly, knowledgeable about drinks, chill. Every interaction I've had the bartenders were cool. My drinks were stiff and even when I managed to spill one on me a bit, they were kind enough to poor me a little more. The drink selection is vast. There's over ten different beers you can get at a time. Some bottles. And a cocktail menu with some of their house made concoctions as well as the classics. The prices are better or standard of what you'd normally see around the neighborhood. The place is new enough for now where you can get a seat. And while me and my friends might be the only ones to have played (I opened the box and pieces and when we went back it was still all intact), they have Stratego! Taking me way back. The Barlow is where I plan on shacking up on those cold nights."

Some of the staff is really great, on top of orders, engaged and have excellent suggestions. But several seem like they had no training or simply don't care. And it doesn't seem to matter how busy it is, if you're there at the right shift you can expect great service. If you're there at the wrong shift, and you've already waited 15 minutes to be acknowledged... it's not getting better from there - come back another day (or don't)."

We got the brisket and pork chop, which were both good but i preferred the brisket as it was more tender. For 10 bucks it's a really massive portion that could probably feed 2 people. We also got the sautéed green beans and the garlic pea shoots. The green beans were delicious and very flavorful. I feel like the pea shoots have a very delicate flavor that get overpowered by the other Hong Kong dishes, but they were still made well. Only downside is that the dishes are more expensive, but they give a pretty generous portion. Overall would recommend if you're in Chinatown and craving Hong Kong food!"

Most of the items on the menu are authentic Chinese dishes with a few exceptions dishes that are the creation adopted to the western taste.To find the best dishes, just look around what are on other people's tables - steamed fish, black calms, etc - and you will get excellent food. Now come the best part, the great value. If you come here before 4pm (lunch), you will get an extensive menu of $10-12 dishes that are good portion and tasty. I would recommend anyone to come here for a fantastic Chinese meal without breaking the bank."

Only caveat is the vegetable dishes are pricey but come on large plates so a bang for your buck if you bring a few folks to share family-style! DISHES TRIED:1/ HK style Pork Chop with rice: broccoli, black pepper gravy and lightly breaded pork chop topped off with an extra crispy chicken leg. Filling and fun with the various textures2/ Baked brisket with tomato over fried rice: your standard frozen veggies like peas and carrots, scrambled egg combined well with the rice. Brisket was fork tender and tendon added a nice chew!"

You can always call ahead to reserve the fish.Veggie portions are huge. We like the Chinese Broccoli with oyster sauce and the stir fried pea pod leaves with garlic.Eggplant  with chicken  casserole is good too. We prefer it without the salted fish. Gotta watch the sodium. If you sit near the back of the restaurant, you can hear the roaring of the woks being fired up. It's all about the heat of the wok (wok hay) that makes the food taste so good."

It's in a tiny strip mall and there's lots of parking space, but it's always so crowded, so you'll likely wait for free spots, even on weekdays. Once inside, you'll see that service is hit-or-miss. Sometimes, I've been wowed, and sometimes, I've been appalled. Depends on the day and the crew. One guy who deserves positive mention is the manager, Rob - he's so welcoming! The short Asian woman is very fast. The older Hispanic woman is so mean. The teenage black guy is sweet and helpful! Coffee is standard; the coffee snob in me says it ranks above Dunkin and below Pret. They have light, dark, decaf, and hazelnut. I prefer the light. They have unsweetened almond milk out on the counter. Lots of tables and chairs. It's a long location, so noise is evenly distributed. Fast WiFi. Very few outlets. Music is on low volume. Other patrons are sometimes so loud and disturbing, especially when they're there with kids, like weekend afternoons. But on the other hand, tables are spread out, so decreased fear of contracting coronavirus!"

Panera is a great healthier option for fast casual food.  I like their lobster roll (when it's in season) as they pack in alot of lobster meat.  They also have realty great coffee here.  I would say their baked goods are a littler pricey ($3.50 for a plain bagel!) but it's always fresh."

I've been going to this chipotle for months (by force unfortunately its near my job and there's not a lot of selections) and always thought the staff was super slow, and undertrained. But TODAY was the day. I ordered my typical order, same order i've been ordering there (and every other chipotle),  so they rung my order up wrong. I stated my order was rung up wrong, and one of the managers who was working the line tried to tell me i was incorrect and thats how they ring it up. So i say "" no, that's incorrect, ive ordered this meal at other locations and they've always rang it up the same way. You're ringing my order incorrect""  .. Might i add, i use to work for chipotle for 4 years so i know how it should be rung up. The cashier proceeds to chime in and tell me the policy changed (a lie cause i literally ordered the same meal a week ago), so eventually they ring it up the correct way, to avoid an argument, and this Cashier PALMOA made the comment "" NEXT TIME YOU CAN GO TO A DIFFERENT CHIPOTLE THAT RINGS IT UP THAT WAY"". At this point, she f**ked up because I'm really like that, and I dont think she knows. So here we are YELP. Here we are.

Wrong.  We arrived pretty much close to closing so there were only one or two patrons left [read: no line].  The staff was winding down but were still courteous and pleasant as ever. The radio buzzing the usual radio stuff. As soon as it hit 11, the phantom DJ employee hit the bachata and salsa and our little spot transformed into a private dance party.  Song after song after song, employees and patrons were putting in WORK.  I would have never guessed this little joint had it in them.Moral of the story: don't sleep on these little 'Mexican Grills' ...I want to shout out the entire staff ... or should I say dance crew at this 200 Varick Street Chipotle."

They barely look at you when you order, and once you do they act annoyed as if they're doing me a favor. They don't have basic manners, such as saying ""you're welcome"" after I say ""thank you."" One time I even asked what teas they have and the barista just said ""here."" and pointed at the options while rolling his eyes as if I asked him for a free ride to the airport.To be honest, solely due to the staff, I go to Irving farm a block over now. Coffee isn't worth the unpleasant experience, especially in the morning."

I came here to detox for about and hour so after work and before meeting up with friends and I'm so glad I did. The seating is limited, but it's got some chill vibes and the staff are super friendly! I had an iced latte and it was made to perfection. I also tried one of their almond croissants and it wasn't bad- I am not a huge almond croissant person and wanted to try something new and was pleased. They definitely have their regulars and you could see how the baristas knew individuals by name and k ew their orders as they came in. If I was closer to this spot I would definitely consider it as a regular spot."
887,rd0VGG_d_qNp_aBW_HJM4w,10/6/2018,3 star rating,"Too pricey, even pricier than comparable drinks at other cafes. A regular-sized, iced soy latte with a one dollar tip comes to.......$7.00. The espresso is also too strong. I'm a regular coffee drinker--an aficionado, some might say--but this was just excessive. I was jittery for three hours. Third Rail Coffee is very good coffee but you'd get just about the same quality for two bucks less a block away. Also, SWARMING WITH LAW STUDENTS AT NEXT-DOOR NYU SCHOOL OF LAW. BEWARE!!!"

My first Yelp review.I should preface this by saying I work in a restaurant and I am sympathetic to the grind (pun somewhat intended). It is hard out here! There are days I would rather stab myself in the eye with a Bic pen than talk to anybody. And maybe the concept of ""hospitality"" in the service industry is entirely fraught to begin with, and a disingenuous expectation to walk around with, especially from hourlies who aren't exactly printing money. But good lord. The disdain. It must get exhausting. The coffee is very good, but it is very good a lot of places, and I see no reason to keep subjecting myself to this."

The latte itself is pretty good, very creamy and smooth espresso. Cozy little spot!"

What I had here was special. Unlike most coffee, which I find needs lots of sugar to counter the bitter, burnt notes that overwhelm my palate. This was just so rich and flavorful. Excellent job and friendly service too."

You will need to place your order ahead of time online (Taco.Menu) and then you'll get notified of when your order is ready. They have some chips + dips, some tacos and some alcoholic + non-alcoholic beverages. It was a busy, beautiful Saturday and Joe Biden had just become the president-elect. NY was ALIVE and Domino Park was no different. Yet, Tacocina was thriving and had quick and attentive service. We got the chips + guac, one pork and one chicken tinga taco, & I got a paloma. I was thoroughly pleased with everything. The guac was amazing & the paloma was quite flavorful but yet light and refreshing as it should be. I would add this to anyones list if they are in the Willamsburg area and want to sit on a lawn chair in the park and enjoy great, fair priced tacos."

This is such a great spot to hang out in the weekend!We had the Chicken Tinga, Roasted Pork & Pineapple and Shrimp tacos. Chicken and shrimp tacos were decent. What surprised me was the pork & pineapple. It was tangy, sweet and flavorful. Each taco costs you $5. This is the reason why I wouldn't be returning. I have had better and cheaper tacos elsewhere."

They have outsode seating with a spectaclur view of the city.While I found the menu limited only having 4 tacos we tried 3 of the 4. Tacos were badic and cost about $4 to $5 each. Ordered a strawberry slush and a berry refresher, both drinks were real good especially on a hot day. Tried the chips with guacamole and another with queso. The guac was fresh and the queso piping hot!. Last we ordered a tasty treat...churros!!!...this was a miss for me, too much sugar and the carmel dipping sauce tasted burnt.Overall it hits the spot when needed."
896,eCD1l-Xx3QqnhrSsoccgMg,3/21/2021,3 star rating,"Stopped by on a busy Sunday while wandering Domino Park. Ordered chips and guac, side of salsa, and chicken and cheese tacosPros - great location, fun snacks for the park, not exorbitantly expensive (feels like they could charge a lot more since they have a monopoly on the location), easy online order process (love a place that takes Apple Pay!). The salsa was delicious and I would come back for the cheese taco - tip: add protein for $1, it's worth it.Cons - pick up communication was poor (my order took longer than the estimate, and they said I'd get a text when it was ready but I never did), chips were so salty it was unpleasant. They also weren't enforcing the ""no outside food or drinks"" rule so the dedicated tables were overrun and we had to search for seating outside in the park.I would come back but wouldn't go out of my way."
897,eCD1l-Xx3QqnhrSsoccgMg,11/2/2019,4 star rating,I mean ... a million dollar view!  Very authentic Mexican taste with a touch of modern. My only complaint is the prices- $7 for the chips and queso was a it extreme when you see the portion. But great food. Tacos have a base cheese shell along w the corn tortillas and are a bit on the greasy side but in a good way - so yummy.
898,eCD1l-Xx3QqnhrSsoccgMg,9/3/2020,5 star rating,This place is smack in the middle of Domino Park. It's one of the only sit down food options in the park. I only saw a few food trucks in the area. It's a really cute taco shack with bright blue colors. They have little picnic tables you can sit at and some standing tables. But most people just eat anywhere in the park. The ordering process is pick up at the moment. You go in and scan a bar code on your phone which opens up a limited menu. You order on your phone and pick it up when it's ready. If you want to order alcohol then you have to order in person. I got the Crispy Cotija & Jack Cheese taco (my fav) for $4. It has cheese inside and outside (hence the crispy part). I also got the mushroom taco for $4.50 which was really well seasoned. The chicken taco for $4.50 was good but surprisingly not as good as the other two. The tacos were a little smaller than average but getting three per person should fill you up. We also got the Berry Agua Fresca for $5 which has a very strong strawberry flavor but it wasn't sweetened heavily so it was a little sour. There's nothing crazy or out of this world here but it just hits the spot and it's a very aesthetically pleasing. I would definitely recommend going if you're in the area!

I was a little discouraged once reaching here and seeing you had to order online but it's crazy how u order and in less than 10 mins your food is ready, there was no logging into apps etc to do or anything so I appreciated that.

Basic setup with lots of outdoor seating for groups, couples, and even the dog.Menu is kept simple to keep the line moving along, several light eats to go along with some drink options. Settled on the Chips & Guacamole ($8) and a Paloma ($10). Drink is a mix of tequila and a bottle of Squirt; fairly refreshing if not overpriced. Guac and chips are your basic fare - a solid handful of hearty tortilla chips and a chunk guac. Dip was pretty good, more on the limey side if you like that kick.Since the seating is in the dirt, the area can get messy (and crowded). Fine spot if you want to stay in the park and have a bite."

I was very happy with my frozen margarita. Staff were kind and friendly. Only issue is that the music is SO LOUD. Do not come here if you are looking to have intimate conversation with others. You literally have to shout to hear the people at your table. I would understand if it was a lounge but it's not- it's a small restaurant with no space for dancing.

It's a great date night spot or even just a dinner spot with friends. It's one of the few places in NYC that has pretty good tacos. As a vegetarian, I've only got the impossible taco as an option which is disappointing compared to other places in the city. However, the impossible taco is delicious and they have great vegetarian appetizers as well. I like their honey empanadas, a very unique appetizer for sure. Their beans and rice are also vegetarian friendly which is a bonus. Their cocktail list is like most typical places but the drinks were good. When we've had Conmigo delivered to us, I was very impressed with the packaging. Out tacos held up and the food was still somewhat hot and tasted just as good as in the restaurant. I do think the prices are a bit steep for the quality and quantity which has contributed to my star rating."

951,zzrm1Da_CuUU-X0wzPTCCQ,11/25/2018,3 star rating,"Andrew and I had a brief breakfast at this place after shopping at BestBuy. It.'s funny that we didn't actually buy anything but obviously we walked enough distance to make me hungry. We shared the combo I before we headed to a beautiful sculpture park. I probably should have followed other yelper's advice and chose a Columbian dish, but I went American... the eggs are fine, potatoes needs more salt and crispier, which requires either more oil or shorter time on the stove. The beef sausage are very good and in fact I was surprised that it was not salty like all these other places. The bread on the side is fine but maybe keep the butter as optional instead of letting it melting all over. People like to make their own food decision and you can at least give them that. Last but not least on the French toast: probably too much soda in it and probably the liquid egg has to be more dense, i.e. more powder. It feels like the French toast is soaked up...Service is fabulous!"

The cook is amazing from his french toast to his Colombian calentado, which is a typical Colombian breakfast of eggs scrambled with tomatoes and scallions accompanied by rice with beans  and a choice of either a grilled steak or chicharrón (crispy  pork belly).  Their breakfast's are so great we have them all  the time. Thank you for the  great meals."

We ordered an omlette and something called the ""lexus of queens"" hero, which was described as a grilled chicken, mozzarella, roasted peppers, lettuce, tomato and balsamic. What arrived was pastrami sandwich of some sort. When I called to tell them it was wrong, they told me that Delivery.com had their menu wrong so what they sent me was the ""right"" Lexus of Queens. Then they were silent. I said, well... this isn't what I ordered. They kept telling me that it was right on their end. When I asked them if I was going to get the sandwich listed on the delivery.com menu they said they would HAVE TO CHARGE ME AGAIN! WHAT?? Are you serious?? After a lot of back and forth, they finally agreed to send me the new sandwich but I would have to return the sandwich I got ...... Are they going to give that one to someone else? Absolutely ridiculous. On top of that, when I called delivery.com to tell them about my experience, they said the restaurant hadn't contacted them yet to fix their menu. Side eye. I will not be ordering from here again. At least the DELIVERY GUY was apologetic. Because he was THE ONLY person who was."

When the plate was brought to me I thought they had made a mistake. The sauce was orange and runny and resembled something like an orange sauce with a few pieces of onions in it. There was little to no seasoning and none of the rich flavor of real tomatoes. Neither did the refried beans have the beautiful coating of cheese present in the menu photo. The rice in the menu picture was saffron color and speckled with cilantro, but I was given plain white rice.I juxtaposed my plate and the menu picture for the server. She shrugged and said, ""the picture always looks better."" Alas, here was the crux of the problem! I suggested to her that the diner should either strive to live up to that picture or use a picture of the huevos rancheros that they actually serve.  I have provided said picture below.The coffee was very good and the eggs were suitably runny; however, I don't like deception, so I won't go back."

This time I got to try a blueberry filled cake, a kimchi fried bun, apple tart, and a strawberry short cake. Everything was good except I found the shortcake to be a bit dry!

Go here to primary purchase birthday cakes, however they do have pastries as well. Usually order from the same cashier when she is there...good that she knows me and service is good. Have ordered from newer folks lately and have to remind them that I requested writing on the cake ...(it's on the receipt).One should order at least 2 days in advance esp if you want writing on the cake. Light whip cream is good, however strawberries are seasonal so hit or miss most of the time...they used to use strawberry preserves inside (which I prefer), but now use real strawberries... Cakes are made fresh daily along with bakery items. Have to try some of the other items.Have tried the rolls before - sometimes moist and other times dry.Overall good bakery in Chinatown."

Someone else came who didn't speak much English, and the other woman who knew Chinese helped her out. When they finished, I asked questions about the different fillings in cake, all of which were pleasantly answered.I ended up getting a rectangular peach & cream cake (NEW) and a circular strawberries & cream cake for $69. Both were packaged nicely, I was given a pack of free candles, and I got two cake cutting knives with free matches. Both the cakes were delicious! Fed 18 people 8 hours later, most of whom were able to try both cakes. People noted the white chocolate flakes on top the peach & cream cake as being not overly sweet and quite good."
966,3BGG2nlFs_TOkRCC2j3m5Q,6/16/2019,3 star rating,"I've seen a few of these Tous Les Jour bakeries pop up all around the city, but have never tried them before now. Everything in the bakery looked so good and I couldn't make up my mind as to which one I wanted, so I purchased a variety to share with my coworkers and try a little bit of each.  The sweet buns and cakes are not overly sweet, which I like. Quite a few of them are filled with some type of cream or custard. They seem to be big on this. The buns are nice and pillowy soft. They're so light you would have no problems eating more than one, and you won't feel like you ate something heavy afterwards. Although they have a nice selection of sweet buns and cakes, they are woefully lacking in some decent, savory edibles. I do not have much of a sweet tooth, so I searched high and low for anything savory to eat. All they had were cold stored sandwich wedges, so I grabbed a couple of these to try, as well. The first sandwich I tried was a turkey club that had a wad of turkey, unripened avocado, bits of bacon, lettuce, tomato, and I think a kind of honey mustard dressing. Firstly, I must point out that they package their sandwiches to look really robust against the cellophane window of the sandwich box, and they do not label the boxes with the ingredients of the sandwiches. After taking the sandwich out, you'll notice that all of the contents are pushed up against this cellophane window, and the rest of the bread has nothing. I get that it's a marketing tactic, but it's really annoying to try to eat. Secondly, what I thought was honey mustard, was so sweet, that it rivaled the sweetness of their buns and cakes. I really could not enjoy this sandwich because of it. The other sandwich I bought was a BLT with a hardboiled egg. Unfortunately, the lettuce and tomato made the bread so soggy that it was just  inedible. I ended up throwing the sandwich away after the first bite.So the verdict is:  yes, try their sweet buns and cakes; and no, don't go in there for anything savory."

We told the waiter and he said that's how they always serve it? Have never been served such little meat on a philly.

This was the only okay item we got.-beef sausage: only 2 halves were given, other diners usually serve 3.-french toast: made with standard sliced bread so very light and not your standard thick/challah style bread.

The French Toast was made well; not too overpowering with the cinnamon. Another great thing about this place is the price! Most dishes are under $10 which I feel is a rarity in Brooklyn.

The food was very subpar. -The philly cheesesteak: it was on a roll which was not stated on the menu and dinnot have any peppers, only sprinkles of onion. On top of that, it barely had any meat! We told the waiter and he said that's how they always serve it? Have never been served such little meat on a philly. Waiter obliged and ordered more cooked meat from the kitchen.-Grilled chicken deluxe: had a nice grilled taste but could have used more chicken. They also could have used a slightly thicker bun so it wouldn't fall apart as the one used was of the lower grade kind carried in a standard supermarket. This was the only okay item we got.-beef sausage: only 2 halves were given, other diners usually serve 3.-french toast: made with standard sliced bread so very light and not your standard thick/challah style bread. Slightly cinnamony but mostly bland. In addition, one of ours had a large piece of eggshell in it. To top it off, the ambience is below average.I feel bad saying it but this is one of the worst places I have been to. Would not recommend."

The food was mediocre, grits bland, ham blah and the toast cold. My bae had a western omelette which has always been my favorite, that was okay. My daughter had pancakes, which back in the daze was always a top choice at Mike's...they still ranking pretty high with that.One last piece...while I enjoy all music, consider your customers please.

Also I love the panels in their bathroom LOL"

If you don't have reservations, they accept walk-ins. Which then makes this the second stop on your night out, because the wait is usually pretty long. Long enough for you to get a drink, if not two, at a nearby bar. But I promise you it's worth coming back. My boilermaker drink order that night was not the best choice. I'm going to venture a guess and say it was the ichi-mas. It came highly recommended and was told it was a blend of a beer and a Japanese whiskey, which in theory sounds great, something I'd enjoy on a warm summer night but not exactly what I was looking for at the time of my visit. Nonetheless, the food more than made up for the lackluster drink. The nori fries with Japanese katsu curry is the poutine I didn't know I needed. The fried chicken sando was delicious. The chicken was fried to perfection and got along famously with the aioli slathered bread. The Katana kitten staff are more than just staff, they are like family to each other. It happened to be a staff members birthday when we were there and they actually had a mariachi band come in and show him and us the best time. I will be back here to try the other drinks and most definitely for the nori fries!"

This place is known for its highballs, which in hindsight I regret not ordering as I had the Fancy Ramune instead. The Fancy Ramune was pretty interesting as it's served with a lemon daiginjo and a glass of IPA, which I confirmed you're not supposed to do as a sake bomb but rather sip instead. Next time I come here I'm definitely getting one of the highballs!"

The perfect sweetness and not a single hint of alcohol, although there is some. We also ordered the Nori fries to grub on as we spent a good 2 hours hanging out here. The service was great, they checked in on us often to make sure we were good and hydrated. Worth the visit if you're in the neighborhood!"

The Meguroni #2 was a nice balance of flavors with the shochu, genever, umeshu, and bitter. The Panda Fizz had a refreshing taste with the combination of vodka, pear, calpico, lemon, and pandan, and the lava salt added a nice touch. We visited on a Sunday night and the atmosphere was perfect - not too crowded and plenty of open seats downstairs around 11pm. While we didn't order food this time, I look forward to trying it on my next visit. Overall, I recommend Katana Kitten for a great cocktail experience."

Katana Kitten has Golden Gai vibes, where you feel like you're wandering through Tokyo to find a very cozy alleyway bar. The drinks are incredible (!!!)

Funky retro Japanese American decor makes this a unique place to grab drinks and catch up with friends. Although it's named one of the top 10 bars in the world 2022, it's not what you would expect from a place with such a ranking. The unique homage to Japanese culture creates a ambiance/vibe that makes it stand out from other typical bars in the area. Cramped tables with precarious seats gives it the dive bar charm. Be prepared to wait as it's a popular place, but there's seating both downstairs and upstairs. If you have the chance, ask to get seated at the bar upstairs! Based on other reviews, food/drinks can be a hit or miss. Everything we ordered was great and I would recommend! Drinks 10/10Beautifully made and all delicious. Our table tried a couple of different ones. Hinoki Martini- a must order. The presentation is phenomenal!!Amaretto SourMeguroni - a close second to Dante's Negroni which are arguably the best in nyc Food Deviled eggs - great presentation Nori Fries - curry dip is amazing and basically like crack. ServiceStaff was super nice but service was what you expected of a busy night. It took a while to get second rounds and she also brought out an incorrect drink. If you're looking for a unique bar that's different from the standard cocktail bar, give Katana Kitten a try! I can't say if it it lives up to the world class ranking, but it's for sure a must visit bar in New York."

I believe it's 3 rolls for $11-$12....Other than that there sushi is far from the best I've ever had but it was ok. I also ordered the sweet potato tempura. When it came in delivery it was pretty soggy and not good. I just think if your going to deliver give it 110%. Online ordering via grubhub was a breeze.

For the location and price, the food is decent. I've been ordering from them for years and honestly, this review is based on delivery and communication. I normally stick to what i like when it comes to sushi- spicy tuna and California rolls (i know, basic but don't judge me. I like what i like haha). When *I* order from them, the fish tastes fresh (because I've seen the complaints) and it tastes good. I had their specifically Odessa roll too and it was also really good. Plus, their spicy Mayo tastes good. Some places have weird spicy Mayo (which tastes sweeter and i hate that) but i like theirs. Also, i recently adventured towards getting edamame! I think they put too much salt but overall, when it is delivered, it is still good and not mushy. Plus, delivery is great! They are super quick and always listen to my contactless delivery instructions! So i will continue to support them because I haven't been disappointed yet!"

There is one lady that works her butt off there everyday and she is constantly juggling delivery phone orders and waitressing if there are people inside. I normally order from the maki combination, great prices if you're looking for something on the inexpensive side and is more filling. I always order spicy mayo because it's a perfect addition to any sushi roll. I love the way they make their spicy mayo because it is filled with more spice than mayo. I personally think too much mayo in a spicy mayo is nauseating with fish. Which is something they do a great job at. Soy sauce is a little too salty for my taste. Otherwise, the food is always on time, the fish is fresh, their food is reliable, and does the job. Their shrimp hibachi fried rice is delicious. My suggestion for the people who stick to only California rolls is to order a California roll with cream cheese and soy paper. (Don't knock it until you try it). Love this place!"

You could probably get better food at Olive Garden. The meatball appetizer was not tasty at all to me. Watery sauce that didn't stick to the food and weird seasoning. The bread given to the table was cold like it had been sitting out. I had the pappardelle bolognese which had the same watery sauce that didn't stick to the food. No flavor at all. I couldn't finish my food because I wasn't enjoying it.The service wasn't great either. The water glasses were so tiny that they could be finished in one sip, yet no one was coming around to tables filling water. Server made it feel like he was rushing while taking our order. The whole place feels like a Greek diner that's trying to be Italian. For the price you could definitely find better food in the area. I'm mad I spent so much money eating here. We only went because it was so close to MSG... for Billy Joel fans looking for ""scenes from an Italian restaurant,"" you won't find it here."

The interiors were really nice with the booths and the Italian art deco posters helped create a pleasant ambiance. The restaurant is really big and is able to hold huge parties which is great for private events/company dinners/ parties, etc. The staff was attentive and made sure everyone was taken care of. However, I ordered a mojito, but they didn't tell me when I was placing my order that it wasn't available. I ended waiting a long time for a drink that never came and I instead got a peach cosmo that was really sweet and gross. I thought the food was pretty good, but not great. For the appetizers, we got meatballs, calamari fritti, and Italian cured meats The appetizers were good and I did like the peppers on top of the fried calamari which gave the dish a nice kick. For the main course, I got a filet mignon cooked medium-rare. I like the meat, but I felt it was a bit tough to eat. Also, keep in mind that it's just the steak and nothing else so you might want to accompany the meat with sides and butter. I also tried the Thyme Baked Salmon and chicken parm which were both good. I liked the desserts a lot. We got the dark chocolate ganache cake, NY cheesecake, and classic tiramisu. All were very good. The chocolate cake was my favorite because I enjoy a rich, thick cake but if that's not for you, the cheesecake was also very good. Overall, I think the food is just ok and prices are typical for New York, but I think there are much better Italian restaurants in the city."

Definitely a ""dine-in"" restaurant (they do not deliver), so you can add extra 20% for the dine-in tip.If you pick up your order and must return for items they left out, they simply add those items to your bill - no courtesy discount, coupon, travel reimbursement etc - to compensate for your time and inconvenience.  Not generous."
1034,YmUKLOG4sTAShvyURuq2zw,9/6/2021,4 star rating,"Mixed opinions about this restaurant. it started off so great but then declined as the night progressed. 4 stars only because of the appetizers and the staff, who were all great. Going right into it: The meatballs were tender and delicious. The calamari was basic, the cheese and fig jam was incredible. Soo tasty would order again. The chicken parm was not the best for the price, the sauce was watery and the breading disintegrated as the meal went on. The baked salmon was really good and flavorful. Paired with the mashed potatoes, you can't go wrong ordering it. The steak was alright. Not worth the price tag and a bit chewy but not inedible. As for desserts, the cheesecake was basic, pretty good. The tiramisu was alright and the chocolate cake was my favorite of the three. Drinks were pricey but hit or miss, atmosphere felt casual and fun."

But you will still have a good meal at a reasonable price. Service was very good when I came for lunch with a friend and my daughter. The clientele was mostly business men/women at lunch time.

They are quite affordable for the location and their salad is filling for sure."
1043,6vfFBzI1Q-rh-5v9ndoyIQ,9/7/2017,3 star rating,"I went to another spot in the area with amazing salads and they were closed, so I came across the street to just salads.  I was confident this would be a phenomenal salad.  Well, I was wrong.  They are missing many regular salad toppings, like regular onions, shredded cheese, green peas, and bean sprouts.  There was no shredded cheese either. Weird. The majority of the staff were helpful and friendly, salad maker was dry and seemingly bothered by my choice to diy instead of going for the menu ready selections.  The chopper was very friendly and brightened up the experience immensely.   I headed over to the cashier with my loosely packed, lightweight, salad.... rang up at $10 something and I did a triple take. Lettuce, edamame, tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, pickled onions (.59 extra), croutons  (.59 extra), shaved parmesan ($1 extra) and ranch dressing.  I quickly got into it, and was taken aback by the lack of any flavor!  I fought through this oddly flavorless salad and got out of dodge.  Before I left, the very friendly greeter/manager chatted me up again and told me the new menus would be coming soon.  I smiled and left.  New menus? I'll pass.  The basics aren't firing on all cylinders, so no gracias"
1044,6vfFBzI1Q-rh-5v9ndoyIQ,1/25/2021,5 star rating,"I been working down in the Financial District for several years now, and Just Salad is one of the mainstays of my lunchtime routine.  I order 3-4 times a week, which translates into hundreds of visits over the years.  The consistency of both the quality of the food/ingredients and the service is as high as any comparable restaurant I frequent.  For reference, I always order ahead using the app, and have not had any issues with my orders.  I would also like to commend the staff working during the pandemic.  I am one of the few working in the office, and Just Salad is still the place I order from the most.  Despite the overall uneasy atmosphere, the staff continues to be upbeat, friendly and accommodating.One recommendation, pre-pandemic, this outlet is one of the few salad places in the area and it used to get slammed during lunch.  When we get back to normal, give yourself extra time to account for the lunch rush, especially if you order online."

Yes, I dropped it. It's my fault. I was told that another tiny piece of bread will cost extra. Really??  It's soooo not worth it.

But I must admit, I was wrong.If you wait till after the lunch rush, you will find two of the most AMAZING customer service people I have ever met. The first one is Tiana; always smiling, always happy works super clean and makes you feel like you're home. The second one is Trevor; with his Leonidas beard and fast hands, this guy can chop vegetables faster than a blender.

A young African American woman greeted me as normal, When we got to the avocados, she dropped a bad half in my salad Quickly, meanwhile there's no line..... Once the avocado was in my bowl, I asked if that avocado is even good, she responded with an attitude stating : ""the avocados are all like that..... unless you want me to pick through all of them"" why would I want a bad avocado in my bowl especially if I'm paying extra for it ? I used to work at a similar job, if the avocados are all bad like that, they're supposed to be THROWN OUT, not placed in someone's bowl for them to eat .... She continued rushing through making the bowl . If you don't like your job, just quit ...I've been to Just Salad's where the service is so good. Not this one."

1055,erGMeWsTisZNrKzfFWCoWQ,3/28/2021,3 star rating,"Just Salad in general is the ugly stepsister of sweetgreen, both of which I think are ridiculous chains that should have died out with covid but somehow are still hanging in, but I guess paying $12 for a pretty average bowl of arugula, chicken thighs, and cherry tomatoes is some people's thing, so whatever.I happen to be extremely lazy, so while I recognize that I'm leaving my apartment to pick up a salad that would have cost me $3 to make at home, I'm also not making it at home.Rant aside, this Just Salad is fine but pretty bad with pickup. Last time I went, I ordered the pumpkin bisque and when I got there, they said they didn't have it and asked it broccoli cheddar was fine. It's like yeah whatever but also I never would have ordered that to begin with. They also forgot our bread and the lemon wedges that the salad was supposed to come with.Anyway, will probably order again out of desperation."

Lol anyway...I walked in about 5:15PM, place was empty. The employees in the back were blasting loud music.The front end employees were mostly goofing off and talking shit. I placed my order and the woman making my salads was a little rude/curt with me. She would laugh and joke with her coworker in front of me and then when she would talk to me, she turned ice cold. Sorry, I am just a customer trying to place an order! Sorry to bother you! She was bumping and grinding to the loud music while preparing my salad. She was talking to her coworker about how small the new chicken they got was. I love hearing about how stingy the company is while I am paying $12 for a salad, lol.I have worked in the service industry. It's hard and it sucks. Of course you want to let off steam and goof off with you coworkers. Of course you want to talk shit about your company and the job. I understand all of this. However, my coworkers and I knew 100% you never do any of that shit in front of customers. It's rude and it also makes the customer feel awkward.Ultimately, this kind of behavior comes down to management. If management is communicating their goals and standards effectively, this kind of stuff doesn't happen. Either the manager here doesn't care or they are simply friends with the employees, so the employees don't take them seriously. 3 stars because the food is good, but don't expect too much service wise."

I went in to try to find out what their personalized pizzas are all about. It was on the menu and only one lady was working. No one was in there so it felt a little odd but that was no big deal. She explained to me how the personalized pizza works and I got the one in the photo for about $5. To be honest, it was frozen pizza dough reheated in the oven but it was delicious and it helped with me sudden bbq flavor pizza craving, so I gotta give it some credit despite all the negative reviews."

1173,PqX9bDlDCc6qOZd2vw4tYw,7/6/2022,3 star rating,"Stopped by here on a day trip to the city. I was curious about the Japanese Mexican fusion concept but was a bit let down. It seemed like two cuisines existing separately on the menu rather than a melding of both. Bento Box- You get two tacos and a side. I got the spicy tuna taco, carnitas taco, and the takumi slaw. I enjoyed the spicy tuna taco wonton shell but there was barely any tuna in the taco itself. It was filled with veggies instead. The carnitas were soft and the tomatillo sauce was flavorful, but the tortilla didn't taste homemade. The slaw is actually a side salad. Loved the sesame dressing but felt a bit misled by the description. The chips were really a bummer. They weren't crunchy and tasted a bit stale.All in all disappointed with the place. To top it off when I asked the employees about what options had dairy in it for my lactose intolerance, they couldn't give me answers. Probably not the best place for dietary restrictions. I don't plan on coming back."

The chicken adobo with the kick of sweet from the mandarin was amazing. New lunch inspo idea!Recommend this place even if the line to order can be a tad long."

I was impressed by this place because they offered a mix of Japanese and Mexican cuisines that caught my attention. I got the coconut shrimp taco and the chicken taco served with a side of corn salad and nachos. My favorite was the hard shelled coconut shrimp that melted right away that went perfectly well with my Brooklyn lager. I highly recommend if you enjoy the cuisine.

The slaw was decent but I wasn't super impressed, but the tacos were good. I liked how the chicken wasn't dry and the tuna had a solid amount of tuna. On the pricey side for my taste and the ""worth it""-ness, but I think this price to value is normal for NY."

1180,PqX9bDlDCc6qOZd2vw4tYw,12/23/2022,4 star rating,Supposed to be a mix of Mexican and Japanese. The influence is predominantly Mexican. The taste was delicious and the texture of the Japanese curry beef in particular was tender. I find it could've been hotter/spicier and the Japanese influences shouldn't get in the way of that. Delicous and worth a first try but plenty of options both in shop and at other places to choose from.
1181,PqX9bDlDCc6qOZd2vw4tYw,12/27/2021,4 star rating,I tend to be wary of some fusion places in food court areas but was pleasantly surprised with Takumi Taco. We were just walking around the area so wanted a snack and ordered their nachos with carnitas and their lychee iced tea. Overall the nachos were pretty tasty. The carnitas were tender and was a nice snack to hold us over. They're not the largest portions so you probably want to order some tacos or other sides if you're a little more hungry. They have some bar seating and a table but they are highly coveted so be on the lookout if you have a larger group as the space doesn't allow you to sit on the window sills or stairs. Would highly recommend their lychee iced tea since it was super refreshing and perfect for a summer day! We ended up ordering another one since it went so quickly.
1182,PqX9bDlDCc6qOZd2vw4tYw,8/6/2022,3 star rating,Always skeptical of Asian fusion places but this was decent. I got the tuna and beef curry tacos. They were very filling. The beef curry taco was super flavorful but the tuna taco was disappointing. The tuna mix was good but there was mostly jicama in it and not enough tuna. Wouldn't get it again. Service was very fast for how busy it was.

The vibe was great. Good music, and the space is very pretty. The only reason they don't have 5 stars is because the service was slow. It took them a while to bring the food. We ordered some drinks which were absolutely delicious! Also ordered the tomahawk steak for 2, creamed spinach (which never made it to the table until our meal was done). Fries, asparagus and crab cakes. The crab cakes were good, but some still had pieces of shell in them. They gave us 3 balls for about $19 i think. The asparagus was delicious. Idk what kinda glaze they put on the asparagus but it was sooo good. The fries were regular. The steak was pretty good. I felt it needed a bit more seasoning, but all in all it was good. It was served beautifully and the fat on the plate was great for dipping. All in all, i would return here. They have a dope brunch menu which i would love to try. 4 out of 5 cuz they forgot my spinach and the service was a bit slow. It's also black owned, so that's always a win win for me. See pics below"

I ordered the spiced budgie drink which was delicious! For anyone who likes spicy Marg type drinks, this is the cocktail for you. 10/10! For food we got the KFB, Potato Au Gratin, and Buffalo Maitaki Bun. The KFB was so good! Perfectly crispy with the right amount of spicy and sweet. Never thought broccoli could taste so good! The buffalo maitaki bun was probably my favorite, wish I'd gotten 2 orders of these! I'm not a huge potato person so the gratin was my least favorite but it still had good flavor. All 3 of these dishes were plenty for both me and my friend. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a vegetarian/vegan spot with fantastic drinks and a great ambience :)"

Enter Ladybird, which makes that so easy! We were able to get an easy reservation online for weekend brunch. Once we got there, it wasn't overly crowded and we snagged a seat outside in the patio area on a beautiful Saturday morning. Service was quick, efficient, and very accommodating. He had a nice surrounding ambience with a colorful patio. We ordered the trio of BEC buns, matcha waffles, and brunch potatoes, along the regular coffee. The BEC bun trio was excellent - that mushroom bacon and chipotle aioli? Yum hit the spot, so satisfying. The matcha waffles had an excellent matcha butter easy to spread on the waffles and mixed with the berry compote was an excellent sweet breakfast treat. The brunch potatoes with the garlic butter were another new favorite, it was crispy, savory, a perfect blend of flavors. The coffee was decent but next time I will probably order the whipped coffee (although $12 for that seemed a big tough to swallow). Overall, the food was amazing, with a great ambience and great service, and while the prices were a bit on the higher side, still an enjoyable time for an aesthetically pleasing brunch in the East Village. It is also nearby a nice park to walk around to digest the food!"

You definitely want to make a reservation if you want a table. We got lucky to even get 2 seats at the bar as we didn't have a reservation. They only serve wine-based cocktails, which is nice and feels healthier. This was my first time trying bao buns and I wasn't disappointed. The bartender was nice and attentive. I wasn't wowed by the food/drink so can't say I need to return but it's definitely worth a try.Go, enjoy"

Our friend had suggested close toe shoes, but we found many seated in the restaurant with flip-flops, so its fairly casual here, just how we like it!While they have an impressive cocktail list, note that they don't serve any hard liquor. It's primarily wine and beer. I ordered one of their overpriced $12 pilsners, which came in a can, so nothing to review here!Our order consisted of a few things which included Buffalo Maitake Bun ($7), Ceviche ($16), Truffle Mac & Cheese ($20) , Grilled Cheese ($16), and Potato au Gratin ($16). Food was good, powerful flavors, but price to portion size ratio was definitely off. Could definitely use some improvement here!Service was good; just 1 thing to remember.

First off the decor is so feminine and pretty, we loved it, make sure to use the bathroom, gorgeous!I am not vegetarian but I like anything if it's delicious and this place did not disappoint. First off the cocktails were amazing, then because it's tappas, we ordered a whole bunch of things. Started with all 3 buns (tofu, mushroom and cauliflower) all 3 were very tasty. Next we had the mushroom onion toast, KFB fried broccoli and the potato au gratin. These were all amazing, as a meat eater I loved them all! We also got the eggplant and that was the only thing I didn't love, the ""ricotta"" had a weird taste to it. Last but not least we got the brownie sundae, it was very delicious, the ice cream wasn't quite creamy enough but with all the toppings it was overall pretty good. Even tho it was written on the menu, we didn't realize it was $25, I would have maybe tried the creme brulee instead with was only $14.

Highly recommend the baos, especially the buffalo Maitake, and the po'boy. They're on the smaller side, but so good! Will have to come back to try the crispy tofu. The KFB or Korean fried broccoli is overrated in my opinion. The broccoli itself is mushy and dense, but the sauce it's covered in is pretty good. I also really liked the mushroom and onion toast, highly recommend if you like mushrooms.The cocktails are all wine based and very good! The lemonade is meh and overpriced.

It was my first night ever in the city, wandering the streets with my vegetarian friends and came across this cozy vegan spot. We were disappointed at first because they didn't have a full bar but their wine based cocktails were absolutely delicious and satisfying. We sat at the bar and still received excellent service. The winner of the night was the buffalo bao bun oh my goodness. But that Mac and cheese also stole the show. Highly recommend!"

The decor is romantic with floral arrangement wall arts, but absolutely can be for girls date night as well!  The staff are friendly and welcoming, our waiter was amazing! His recommendations were on point and we enjoyed a delicious & gluttony (in a good way) dinner. My sister got a wine and I got their strawberry mocktail - refreshing! Starters, we got the crudo with caviar (MIND Blowing good!), and the octopus (this was good but the caviar dish was better!).  We shared the blue crab spaghetti and the risotto with bits of lobster.  Definitely get the BLUE Crab Spaghetti - OMG. Devine.  The risotto was sadly undercooked, flavor was missing a notch, and made it hard to eat. Then secondi, we split the poached lobster dish and it was absolutely the right choice.  If I'm redoing this meal - I'd skip the octopus & risotto, replace it a fish, maybe the snapper (table next to us got it and looked yumFinished our meal with... an adult Affogato (yep, there's liquor)... which my foolishness, I didn't pay attention... bc I was doing the gram... so I couldn't really enjoy my espresso.  My face was on fire after just sampling the ice cream...  my body cannot process alcohol, hence why I ordered a mocktail. So pay attention to what you're ordering!  Sister got a complimentary cake dish for her birthday and it was good!! Very Nice touch!  #chefskissOverall, a deserving Michelin star and would come back for another meal.  #feasting#pastalover#yelplife"
1204,bEXTA_Gwo2oVg4gnFd9fNA,10/4/2022,5 star rating,"I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday last week and deeply enjoyed the pasta here. Service was top-notch and I appreciated that there was a friendly sommelier in-house to help my inexperienced self choose a wine for the dinner. We asked the waiter about whether she preferred the famous trofie nero pasta or the spaghetti because my boyfriend and I were torn, and she said it's pretty 50/50 across the staff. She preferred the spaghetti, so I made sure to steal some of my boyfriend's when he ordered it. I can see why the trofie nero is popular. While it's not going to fill you up completely, it's a satisfactory portion and cooked beautifully. You will be able to taste all the scallops and seafood flavor, and the small crumbles on top added such a nice textural element. BUT... I think the spaghetti was the winner for me. It was such a unique dish that balanced the clean, tomato flavor with creaminess of the roe and crab. The spicy kick to the pasta was so memorable and what made this yummy dish unique. I would come back just to eat this again. This dish + the lobster soup appetizer was simply chef's kiss. Yet another amazing Michelin star experience in NY!"
1205,bEXTA_Gwo2oVg4gnFd9fNA,10/13/2022,4 star rating,"This place has an amazing bar, staff, and happy hour.A lot of drinks were $4 off for happy hour, which softens the blow that they all start around $19. The bartender made me a Mai tai, but I didn't like the dark rum so I switched with my fiancé. He really liked my drink and I liked his tequila, pineapple, and cranberry. To eat he got the squid ink pasta and I got the blue crab pasta. His entree was good, with a crunch but not as good as mine. The blue crab pasta was fantastic and I haven't eaten blue crab in years. All the pastas are $15 during happy hour, but they are very small portions. I recommend ordering more than one if you're hungry and definitely try the blue crab pasta. The staff was attentive, but not entirely knowledgeable about the happy hour. Plus I had to ask for the happy hour menu, which switched the mood slightly. This place was pretty empty around 5pm on a Tuesday, so finding bar seats was easy. Also, we made a reservation for bar seating or close to the bar beforehand. The bar area is really nice, especially with the small seating behind the main bar. The music was lively, but not obnoxious. I probably will return, but hope the staff is more aware of the happy hour menu. One of the bartenders was awesome! Happy hour is from 5-6."

1207,bEXTA_Gwo2oVg4gnFd9fNA,9/24/2022,4 star rating,"We had the four course prix fixe menu and could barely finish our food! Started off with appetizers. We shared the lobster soup, the crudo and the octopus. All were excellent!Next, the risotto and blue crab spaghetti were cooked to the perfect al dente. The pasta was slightly better than the risotto as the flavors and texture melded together really well without being overly rich or creamy. The duck breast entree was amazing but by this time, we were too full to finish our food. Finally for dessert we had the panna cotta which was just okay. The severs kept mixing up our orders and served dishes to the wrong diner twice, which was very surprising. Other than that, it was a pleasant dining experience, perfect for a special occasion."
1208,bEXTA_Gwo2oVg4gnFd9fNA,9/24/2022,4 star rating,"A 1 Michelin-starred restaurant, Ai Fiori is a fine dining restaurant located up a beautiful staircase from the Langham hotel lobby. Dining here, you feel like you are in the center of New York with the huge windows looking down on 5th Ave and being surrounded with generally nicely dressed clientele (although they have no dress code and even let people in wearing shorts). I had a nice meal here, but I'm not sure if the high price point can be fully justified.We ate some complimentary bread as an appetizer and for my main, I got the Trofie Nero, which was a squid ink pasta with scallops. I was a bit underwhelmed by the dish's size and the number/size of the scallops. Since the restaurant intended the pasta to be only one part of a multi-course meal, I guess the dish is a reasonable size but I have seen better  scallop to pasta ratios in other reviews so that's harder to justify. The pasta was a unique coil-shape and the seppia spiced mollica (which tasted like breadcrumbs) were tasty too. Overall, the dish was good but felt like it was lacking something as I was basically eating pure carbs.I shared the Panna Cotta and Cioccolato for dessert, which ended up being the highlight of the meal. Both dishes were beautifully arranged and surprisingly filling. The Panna Cotta, which was topped with gold flakes, has a surprisingly complex and nutty flavor. The Cioccolato had a more familiar chocolate and banana taste and was also delicious.Service-wise, the service was a little less attentive and slower than expected. However, they do get some bonus points for cleaning up the table crumbs between dishes and giving us some complimentary basil bonbons (very strong basil taste enclosed within white chocolate) to cleanse our palette at the end of the meal.I don't think my high expectations for my expensive meal -- not to mention for a Michelin starred restaurant -- were completely met but it wasn't completely off-base either."

We were limited on time and only ordered two main courses - I had the pan seared Halibut and my friend had the pan roasted Monkfish. We had a side order of Funghi - Wild Mushrooms in a savory sauce. My halibut was delicious - tender and flavorful. While it's served with its own caramelized onion jus, I smothered the fish with the side dish of those Wild mushrooms, having it with every bite; it's a must. I had a piece of the Monkfish; while it was very tasty, I overwhelmingly preferred the Halibut!"

The service is good, although the restaurant is located inside of the Langham Hotel on 5th Avenue, so the area can be a bit touristy / chaotic at times. The service is generally good albeit a bit slow. The 1st time we came, one of the guests in our party asked for a non-seafood substitution to the menu, and they forgot to do so. I would probably come here again."

Breakfast menu was underwhelming. Le Pain is 10x better than this pretentious bland place. My frittata was dry, soulless, and I gave up after two bites. * I'm editing my review because the service was great and our server overheard me trash the frittata so they removed it from my bill. Thank you!"
1212,bEXTA_Gwo2oVg4gnFd9fNA,6/21/2022,4 star rating,"Sort of 3.5 but mostly because I feel like they might have included too much food in their 12 course meal!! I couldn't finish the lovely dessert at the end because I was so full. For the astronomical price you definitely get your money's worth at the end. There is so much food and you would want to finish ever single one of them. Don't even bother with the bread on the table (my rookie mistake). I honestly don't think I would come here again. Maybe for a significant event, but it is just too expensive, and the crowd over here seems less friendly than your average restaurant. Do I want to hear someone name drop a former President because they claim to know them? Not really. Table next to us was talking about crypto, pretty sure a table across from us was a young woman with a much older gentleman/sponsor. Not sure what I expected but I was kind of turned off by the clientele. You're paying for the artistic display of the food, the interesting vibes, and classy decor. It definitely attracts a certain group of people and the food is good, but I will not be returning. But by their clientele... honestly they wouldn't miss me!"
1213,w3t0p9aamiYGjn_Uubu2WQ,11/12/2019,3 star rating,I personally did not like this bar. It was a Random Thursday night. $9 for a ketel one and sprite. Seems a little high for me. My coworker is female and stared at the whole time by the three other people at the bar. They looked like regulars and maybe we obviously were not.  So not a reflection of the bar just creepy to be stared at the whole time. Waitress who was also the bartender was super nice and did stop by a few times.  But than disappeared.  Possibly went to the back to get something but never came back out. Couldn't order more drinks or get the tab if we wanted to leave. Why I personally didn't like the bar.  The drinks were ok.  Not hard to make but they sprite tap tasted funny like it had tonic still in it.  At most ten people total at the bar for this random Thursday night.  But when it got hard to flag the staff down. I get a little annoyed. I hope maybe they just had a short staffed off night. As it's roomy and when the waitress was available she made it a point to keep stopping by which I appreciate.  I'd go back again to see as the other reviews are very positive so hopefully just a one off

This place exclusively uses a device to pour an ounce maybe an ounce and a half?  Plus they charge 8 bucks a drink in Queens for this.  I'll stick with regular pubs in Queens which may pour you a little more say a half of an ounce per drink,  and I'll sit there all day drinking lots and being merry, buying drinks and tipping well.  I always avoid bars who have cheap owners. And just so you know,  this is a BAR pub like place not a restaurant. It's got a pool table,  that is the only redeeming quality.  However cheapness on the owners part will make me only buy one drink.   You got my eight bucks and no more,  enjoy it."

Winners Bar is a stone's throw away and you can bring in your own food, so hey - perfect. Perfect in theory, anyway.It's a bit expensive given it's location (a $6 bottled beer in Elmhurst?) and the regulars are downright scary (I could feel myself being stared at from every direction). But on the bright side, they did have a pretty nice jukebox and three brand new HD TVs with soccer playing above the bar. This could be a great place to catch a futbol match, but I'd suggest doing research before arriving with another team's uniform on. It seems like the kind of place where trouble could find you if you're not on the same page as the other patrons...For your dive bar fix it'll do the trick."

I pulled up my trusty Yelp app and bagel places kept popping up. We were in the Bronx and I'm like, okay let's just do it. Bagels on Bartow was it, we found parking at a meter out front and walked in. Super hole in the wall joint and right up our alley. We asked all the questions and the girl behind the counter was So helpful. We picked our two breakfast sandwiches and got a free bagel for checking in with Yelp, yay! My total came to like $8 or $9 and that made me jump for joy! Such a cheap breakfast and I was so full after. I went with the pumpernickel bagel and boy was that a win. Guys, I wish I could eat that bagel every day but I live in Ohio! This was such a wonderful find, if we head that way again, I'm stopping and getting a dozen for the road!"

The food tastes like its been using the same oils over and over. After certain degrees the oil can be damaging to your GI system. We've all had bouts of diarrhea in our home after eating from here in the morning. They simply need to be on top of this.They need better quality bacon and not fry it to death. Bacon, egg and cheese is a morning staple. The bacon is hard/burnt and tasteless. I would pay a few cents more for better bacon and cook that wont burn it to a cinder.Taste, after all is important.More variety of bagels would be appreciated. They know their business and know what sells and what doesn't, but some more artisan and varied flavors would be highly appreciated.They are a friendly bunch and when the store was open before Covid the vibe was a good one. Delivery for the most part is fast and friendly. However, the few things I mentioned above are serious infractions in my book. I cant blindly recommend a local joint (as much as Id love to) when they cant get the fundamentals straight."

For those that don't know, my wife is proudly from the Bronx, NY and she and my mother-in-law have timelessly introduced me to the life of Bagels on Bartow, Inc. I typically get the turkey sausage, egg & cheese! Or the everything bagel toasted with cream cheese. Did I mention their bagels are baked fresh everyday??!! Yup! They also have a section of Boar's Head meat section. Plus the desserts on top to close out the meal. When I came this time, I noticed the art work of the menu was gone and their presentation game has stepped up tremendously! The menu has lost that community - we-create-it-here feel, BUT we all need to evolve at some point. They're business growth is fine by me if it means they keep the quality of their food and the high level of engaged service to their customers. Within the first few seconds of me being in this establishment, I noticed the menu on the top wall gone and said, ""what happened to the beautiful art wall menu?"" and one of the employees joked with me saying ""the customers need to see the beautiful new paint."" That type of involvement means something to me. And I was glad to experience that today."

I've been getting fresh, hot, delicious bagels from them since I was a young girl running rampant in the streets of Co-Op City. They have always had the freshest bagels of anywhere else I've traveled. They are always freshly made on the premises. I used to always get a hot garlic, everything or raisin bagel with butter to go. They've never disappointed me. Not as a youth nor as an adult. The quality hasn't  even gone down over the decades of service they have provided. The staff continues to be and always has been AWESOME!!  Hence, the 5 star review.

1249,gosjtZsjmPTIBY4eB4qD2Q,3/15/2021,5 star rating,"As a vegetarian, the options at most bars are limited to fries and pizza, and if you're lucky, a veggie burger.  Bravest has one of the most extensive vegetarian (and vegan) selection I've seen for a local neighborhood bar.  Food:  the nice thing about Bravest is it actually has vegetarian / vegan options that won't leave you feeling grossly heavy afterwards.   the vegan crunchy tortilla wrap is amazing.  Made with vegan chili and vegan queso with crunchy tortilla stuffed inside a soft tortilla wrap, it's just divine.  The Buffalo cauliflower wrap is also excellent.  The Buffalo cauliflower is flash fried, dressed with Buffalo sauce and then combined with lettuce, shredded carrot and cheddar.  The cheddar melts nicely and doesn't feel overdone.    Service: especially for a neighborhood bar, the service was excellent.  Our waitress was attentive and very responsive to requests.   The ambiance is nice and laid back.  Highly recommend this place not just to grab a drink but for food as well!"

I consider this as an assault. It is unacceptable in this neighborhood. This is an international neighborhood and if you don't like it go back to your shithole.

For starters the only red wine they had was Merlot, then the waiter we had did not now what vegetables they had, and was completely unfamiliar with the menu. I ordered an entree to take home for my wife and asked if he could bring it out after we ate so it would be fresh but it came out with our dinners anyway, so far the service was sub standard. I had the cavatelli with sausage and broccoli rabe with was tasteless and the broccoli rabe had the texture of under cooked kale, a total fail of an anticipated good meal. The New York Cheesecake was okay but my coffee was so weak it tasted like dish water. I guess another restaurant that was very good in the past has joined the ranks of many failing businesses."

I had the seafood platter which was overflowing with clams, mussels, shrimp and calamari. Sauce was perfect as were the seafood. My wife had the linguine and clam sauce which, again, were plentiful and delicious. We got there early and it was great to see the room full up quickly. A great place, for us , well worth the trip."

The antipasto salad was amazing, the sourdough bread very fresh. We then had penne with vodka sauce--basil was so good, then the tossed salad, followed by the main course. I chose the veal. The service was great considering how many folks they had to service. I wish and pray one-day real Italian food will come to Virginia, but I have been here since 1978 and am still waiting.

I go out of my way to support black-owned businesses and being vegan, it's hard to find food in this area that is healthy. My first time visiting I got a smoothie and the owner Pascal along with a woman that works there had a great, brief conversation. Because the service and smoothie was so good I decided to call and order a veggie burger with fries a different day. The short bearded man took the order over the phone. He said it would only take 10/15 minutes. It took 30 minutes . When I got there he was having a conversation with a customer. When I mentioned that I was there for the order over the phone, he continued to talk to her until I told him that I was on my lunch break. When I got back to work, my burger was burned. 3rd visit: gave them 30 minutes to make my burger and it was ready in tht time (on this day the woman that was there on my first visit was there working the register. 4th visit today: I called 30 minutes before going. When I arrived the man said it wasn't ready and left. When he came back he repeats my order to me. When I tell him I'm paying card/Apple Pay he tells me the machine is down. Luckily I had cash. DID I MENTION IT TOOK AN HOUR SINCE I CALLED?!?? Anyway, I was so focused on getting out of there I didn't realize he overcharged me. (What was normally $10.89 for 1 order was $26 for 2 orders). Then I get back to work to burnt burgers and burnt fries. Also, I asked for extra sauce and somehow received less than I normally get (this is a part of my order that he repeated to me). Before leaving the same bearded man tells me that he didn't have everything and that's why he took so long. I'm going there after I get off of work to get the overcharged amount back, but I'm not going back after today. PROS:*good smoothie consistency *vegan options*tasty vegan sauce*black-owned business *good portions for the price"

I was feeling a smoothie but then I saw a picture of a beautiful acai bowl. I immediately decided to et the Acai bowl. BIG MISTAKE. First it took 20 minutes!! 20  MiNUTES *Big Drako voice*. I should of known immediately however I was patient. Once it was done he put the bowl in a brown bag and of course I look in the brown bag just to make sure it was my order it was. However when I take it out the bag I was so disappointed this wasnt even an Acai bowl it was basically a smooth drink not even a smoothie. There were some banana slices & maybe two strawberry. It was very disappointing. Oh and the smell of bacon and meat in the site made it very hard for me to wait 20 minutes, but I wanted to support Black Business but now I know I wont be supporting this one."

Everyone here is nice and accommodating, even the young lady who took my order. They make the food to order so you may have to wait for a bit but it's well worth it. The salmon burger was great, not dry. The sauce was a nice addition as well. The fries were well seasoned and not salty. I'm happy this place is here so hopefully people in the area support."

If you leave a review and make a food purchase, you get a free margarita so who wouldn't want a free $12 cocktail (I'd assume they'd want you to leave a 5 star review, we didn't get our drinks comped lol).Found this spot on Yelp since I was going to a Broadway show nearby. The reviews and ratings looked good and it looked like this spot was recently opened so I thought let's give it a try. The beginning was going well, I arrived earlier than my friend and I was able to sit at a table as I was the only person in the restaurant. Where things went downhill was after we ordered our food. We waited 45 mins to get our food, not once was it communicated to us that there was a possible delay or even an acknowledgement. The two workers tonight were Eric the bartender and Leasia the waitress. We asked about our food after waiting over 30 mins when we noticed all the tables that came after us received their food already before us. We didn't even order anything big or apps, just 2 tacos and a chicken sandwich. By the time the food came out, I had to rush and scarf down my chicken sandwich and fries within 15 mins so that we could make it to our Broadway show."

The service was great and the drinks were very good. The chicken Bamh sandwich was a very good portion esp with the large side of sweet potato fries! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends."

The only thing missing is actual French  food on their menu. Nonetheless the food is very good and quality. It is pretty standard for a semi-casual expensive sit down restaurant in a trendy area."
1314,Ig4LSE3TRPs5nSsfTgnniQ,10/15/2022,5 star rating,"No longer the lost neighborhood hideaway it was pre-pandemic, and still every bit as much fun and tastier than ever. Cluny is a buzzing but intimate French spot that is great for dinner and for lunch. Tables are packed together and the music is ON! and yet your conversations are private, your neighbors won't bother, and you won't be hoarse afterward. The food shines brightest where Cluny's sauces and dressing are involved -- the frisée salad with runny egg, the chicken with jus, the steak au pôivre are delish. Good wine list and well-made cocktails. Best spot you'll find downtown for a leisurely rainy-day lunch."
1315,Ig4LSE3TRPs5nSsfTgnniQ,7/31/2022,2 star rating,"I wasn't too impressed by Cafe Cluny's tiny drinks, high prices, and lackluster flavor. I came on a Saturday night with a decent sized party and we were seated immediately, which is already a red flag. The decor is cute, but a bit cheesy with striped shirts of the waiters and there was no music playing. I ordered an espresso martini, probably the smallest I've ever been served (all drinks were in the same small glass). I was between the tuna burger and sticky rice, and ordered sticky rice. I was underwhelmed by the lack of flavor and the tiny amount of avocado. Someone in my party got the tuna burger and complained it was a bit fishy, so I didn't miss out there. Service was proficient, nothing wrong. I understand the high prices since it's a prime West Village corner lot, but I definitely won't be back."

They were very helpful with what I could eat considering I need to be gluten free AND dairy free (which I know is annoying, damn autoimmune disease). I had the purple sticky rice bowl and it was very tasty and unique. My husband had the lobster roll which he liked but said it was a little small and our friend had the burger. For dessert my husband and our friend split the ice cream sandwich and I got the raspberry sorbet which was delicious. I just loved the atmosphere here. It felt very NY. Haha. Which is nice when you live in LA."
1318,Ig4LSE3TRPs5nSsfTgnniQ,4/2/2023,2 star rating,I've always enjoyed my visits to Cafe Cluny until last night. The restaurant was lively but had a few open tables. Our server was attentive at first but after she forgot to put in our order it went downhill from there. Once our food finally arrived we put in a drinks order-two beers and a glass of wine (nothing complicated) and we still had to ask our server twice before getting our drinks. When the drinks did arrive we were all but finished eating. No apology. No reason for the delay. Just poor service. The food was yummy but we won't be going back any time soon. I emailed to share my shabby dining experience directly with the restaurant but didn't hear back from them. All in all the dinner left a bad taste in my mouth.

Our server really knew how to banter well with my family, and made nobody ashamed for ordering extra fries (which are excellent, btw.) Drinks were all very solid- I got the nonalcoholic one and everybody said it was good. Don't skip dessert, the beignets and the sticky toffee pudding were standouts."
1321,Ig4LSE3TRPs5nSsfTgnniQ,3/27/2022,4 star rating,"4.5 stars for a nice, post-barbershop outdoor breakfast on a cloudy spring morning. Café Cluny was buzzing on the inside, but outside's dining kiosk offered more space and quiet after a prior late night of March Madness celebration.This is a good quality breakfast at Manhattan prices. I had the three eggs special, scrambled with cheddar and onions folded in. The eggs were tasty but perhaps could have had another minute in the pan. The breakfast potatoes were well prepared and the toast was toast, accompanied by the smallest jar of raspberry jam. I wasn't in a lingering mood, so no mimosas or coffee, and just orange juice today. Service was strong, with a friendly host stand vibe and a server who was thoughtful and attentive. Judging by the clientele and the snippets of conversations overheard from neighboring tables, this is a precious neighborhood, with many very particular and older, moneyed people. From my own waitering days, these types of people can be annoying, but the server did a great job."

To be honest I have only ever got the tuna burger when I go there as I always think it's really tasty. A bit on the salty side though. Great fries.Nice service and not too rushed.
1323,kMljfja7weqfl_lzspjzHA,1/2/2018,3 star rating,"This McDonalds is OK - much better than the one on West 4th in term sof customer service and efficiency. The interior is pretty clean with lots of seating on the lower level. The upper level used to be open all the time but in my recent visits here, I've noticed they closed it off. I guess it makes sense to save on the cleaning. One thing that annoys me is when the customers form one line down the center and we get yelled at to form 2 lines. This makes NO sense because often times, the in line you choose out of the 2, you end up behind someone slow and frustratingly watch people who arrive after you on the other line order before you even do. Just let us make the 1 line and everyone can be fairly served based on when they get on line. Overall pretty standard McDonald's in the area with the regular menu items and the ability to use physical coupons or coupons off their mobile app."

Definitely not the worst I've seen but can surely be cleaner or at least smell cleaner. Staff wasn't too friendly and kind of cold but wasn't too rude either.

And starts cooking fries at that moment, literally 15 minutes after I ordered.Unreal. At that point I walked out and lost my $2.09."

I came here last night for a soft serve ice cream cone (like $1.80 or something) and they gave me the biggest ice cream I've ever seen in my life. It was absolutely humongous, and I actually dropped the first one they handed me because I wasn't prepared! Honestly it's too much ice cream to eat in one sitting (health-wise), but fantastic for the money. Props to that guy who hooked it up."

The cocktails we ordered weren't the greatest, a little harsh from lower quality liquor I assume, but they got the job done. We all ordered some kind of pasta dish and were satisfied enough. Amazingly, the garlic bread with Calabrian chili may have been my favorite part of the meal (it was really good!) while the arancini were a decent app as well."

As another reviewer stated, the average clientele does seem to be on the older and white side. My friend and I are two younger Asian women and as we looked inside it seemed like we were the only POC there, so I was slightly worried about being out of place. However the service was very good -- our waiter was very friendly, and every other server I encountered inside was great as well.We ordered the spicy garlic bread ($6), their risotto (around $29), and steak (around $33)  to share. The garlic bread was very good but very spicy, so be warned. The risotto was also delicious, and there was a generous amount of shrimp in it -- in 2 scoops I counted 6 small shrimps. I thought the steak was cooked well but nothing amazing. For dessert we got the tiramisu to share ($8) and it was also very tasty and satisfied us both. So overall we were pretty happy.This place only takes cash, and the total for us after tax and tip was $100."

But the reason why I still think this place deserves 5 stars... I've been here before a few times and their pasta dishes, especially gnocchi is everything and more! My suggestion if you do decide to pop in... call ahead because there are lines out of the door and get some type of pasta dish!"

On my way home this evening, I grabbed a Artisan Grilled Chicken Sandwich as a snack before I went out this evening. When I got home and opened up the box, I found a prize inside my sandwich and not one of the fun ones you get in a Happy Meal.What I found was a strip of paper towel--marked with blood--hanging out of my sandwich (see photo). Which means that, at this location (at least), (1) workers are prepping food bare-handed and (2) when they have an open wound on their hands, they apparently wrap it in a torn piece of paper instead of bandaging and gloving the hand to prevent contamination of the food. So, yep, now I'm done with this location. I can't trust the food handling at this location and I'm not keen for a special prize that isn't a Hot Wheels."

Luckily, this location is open 24hrs Th-Sun, so they're here to quell your late night Mac attack. The location itself is fine; two levels of seating and modern enough to have the touchscreen ordering systems in the front. Don't be fooled though, while it might be empty in here late in the eve and while you'll see plenty of people working in the kitchen, it will take an eternity to get your food. Maybe it's bc they have to make it to order this late (lets hope it's that), but it's probably due to the fact that the workers are often engaged in a (very loud) war of words and decide they have something better to do. So, can you get some late night McD's in a safe atmosphere here? Yes. Will you be in and out? Nope. Still, you need that Mac, so suck it up and get on over."

Note that we had to cause a scene and be a total Karen in order to have a manager take over and then we had a better experience. Restaurants should be checking in with their wait staff to see if they are mentally sound to be interacting with their customers cause ours surely was not.

1365,Ps0cOZevNA1M9M5_z7W3oQ,10/4/2019,4 star rating,This review is only for the bar and drinks as I tend to stay away from eating at a bar. I've visited Lonestar basically every night of the week but the only night I did not enjoy was Tuesday night which is Karoake night. Friday and Saturday nights tend to get busy but getting drinks doesn't require a long wait as the bartenders are pretty quick and efficient. The bar and restrooms are always kept pretty clean.Lonestar is a great local bar with friendly staff.
1366,Ps0cOZevNA1M9M5_z7W3oQ,5/14/2020,4 star rating,This is the best go to place especially during quarantine. The food always arrives hot and isn't greasy at all which is hard to come by especially with bar food. I must say my favorite thing on the menu is Philly cheese steak sliders! My one complaint is that they don't always  have liquor when you call to order food but other then that I recommend giving them a try.
1367,Ps0cOZevNA1M9M5_z7W3oQ,7/7/2019,4 star rating,"I'm surprised I've never done a review for this place but it's a pretty cool local spot.  Local Bay Ridge people hang here, so if you're intimidated by that, just keep that in mind. Witty banter fly's around the bar when they get rolling.  On holiday's these guys do a big backyard BBQ and it's just a fun place to hang.  On cooler weather they keep the front garage door open.  The bartender young ladies are cool and friendly.  Coldest Bud light, on ice that I've had in a long time."

But I guess at the end of the day, I really don't care either way because it's a solid sports bar.Tons of TVs, though when I was there, they tuned them all to the same game while others were going on.There are definitely regulars who come here, and you'll be able to spot them from a mile away.The back of the bar has some old quarter slot machine style games, which is pretty retro.Surprisingly good beer selection too."

Yes the Yankees are playing but it's only half full but there's no way I should be waiting an hour and counting for 3 dishes of food. Finally 1 hr 13 mins I get my food. Food is VERY good tasting and nice portions but when you order sliders for kids and you notice molded bread you tend to be upset. Food- great. Service- mediocre cause wasn't there fault. Wait time- TERRIBLE. Molded bread- TERRIBLE

It took two hours to get to me and when everything came it was cold and overlooked.  I called to speak to a manager and was very polite about it.  I was put on hold so they could take my information and no one ever came back.  I called back from a different line and apparently there are no managers there when the restaurant is open..  DO NOT EAT HERE!  It is pathetic food and completely overpriced.  Way to go Lonestar.

1374,eNNx2BSmwcvjpA0QJUT1nQ,11/14/2021,4 star rating,I was spoiled growing up in Brooklyn and the numerous pizza joints in and around my Italian neighborhood. It's hard to find a pizza place that isn't complete trash that slaps cheesy crusty oil together here in Queens. Rosa's Grandma Pie however definitely holds up for a Queens pizza joint and I've never been disappointed ordering from them. Their pizza is the perfect amount of thin and it's extremely flavorful. The sauce isn't too overpowering yet it packs a delicious punch. Would recommend stopping by for some solid Astoria pizza.

Food: I usually get there ravioli slice which is really great but super heavy, so only eat it if you are really hungry. The vegetable slice is great and veggie packed. The spinach ricotta slice is not my favorite Bc the spinach tastes raw. The baked ziti was ok, wouldn't order again. Price: reasonable prices - regular slice is $3 Service: quick friendly serviceAmbiance: done outside seating but no heated seating. More of a takeout place until indoor seating opens"
1381,eNNx2BSmwcvjpA0QJUT1nQ,7/11/2020,4 star rating,"While I would still give the upper nod to the Maspeth and Ridgewood locations, Rosa's of Astoria is certainly no slouch in the pizza game. Given the expansion of the Rosa's empire, I am actually really jonseying for one to open closer to me. If I still lived in Astoria, I'd be very pleased to patronize this location often.And yet, I still find myself here more often than not. 21st is not riddled with great eateries, so when I'm in the area and it's late and I'm hungry (#1), I'll knock out a couple of slices when I get a chance. Unlike the other locations which look like they're stuck the 80s (#2), this location is the newest, hence it's updated with lots of seating, an open kitchen, and a TV playing in the background.Who doesn't love Rosa's signature inside-out sicilian? While I still love the slices, I find it to be just a tad saltier than the ones I'm used to. Grandma slice is also quality and I could get down with the ravioli or margherita anytime. And like any good pizza, this stuff is still rock solid when eaten at room temperature.The guys who are behind the counter are friendly and courteous. They are really good with the delivery and are fast about getting slices out to folks. One advantage the Astoria branch has is that it takes credit cards, which is a big win. I'll keep coming here as long as they keep serving pizza, which I hope is for many years to come.____________(#1) Which happens a little *too* often.(#2) That is a compliment. Really."

Turns out CD purchased the store next to them and expanded - the inside has been revamped with a lot more seating! When you enter there are two registers - one for donuts/ coffee/etc and then the juice bar counter. From the looks of it they have a very extensive menu - different fruit bowls, juices and smoothies. I ordered the Go Green - which is spinach, kale, cucumber, celery and lemon. This was super fresh and you have the option of two sizes (16 or 24 oz) - I went with the 16 oz. One of the guys who works there, Dennis, was very friendly and gave a recommendation for the next time I come in. I stopped in again today and ordered the Wide Awake (almond milk, espresso, coffee, banana, peanut butter and vanilla whey protein). This was also delicious. I'm so glad there is a juice bar so close to home! If you haven't been there in a while, it's definitely worth checking out."

I grew up with a true Italian grandma making me food every day, and this place is like stepping into a time machine and tasting it all again. Everything is fresh and made from scratch in a way that no other place around here can touch - especially not for affordable prices. The meatball sandwich is ridiculous - I have a hard time not ordering it every time. But I want to try everything! They are famous for their rice balls, and they really are great. So good that I signed up for the class to learn how to make them.This place is a unique neighborhood gem and I am so happy it is here. Keep doing what you are doing!"
1394,B1Bf8SnkYPEKaqcUepwfTQ,5/28/2018,5 star rating,"I knew there had to be a place like this somewhere in the city. I'm glad I finally found it. My wallet may not be so glad about it. Archestratus appeals to three of my senses immediately, sight, smell, and taste. It's very well organized, with a large section on New York City cuisine... but I guess the world does end at Yonkers, because not so much on other parts of New York State (a selection of Moosewood restaurant cookbooks would have gone well here) - not that I can't find those books in upstate New York anyway.  I was also surprised at the relatively small number of African cookbooks. But those are minor compared to the wealth of styles of books offered here, and my ethnic cookbook collection appreciates it. But I think I need to buy another bookshelf before returning here."
1395,B1Bf8SnkYPEKaqcUepwfTQ,10/18/2015,5 star rating,"Absolutely LOVED this fabulous new cookbook store (!!) in Greenpoint. We read about it in the NYTimes and had to check it out for ourselves. We love to cook so this place was heaven. Books are organized well, with sections for different countries/backgrounds (e.g., Italian, Jewish, Caribbean, Nordic), different techniques (e.g., pickling, farming, baking), as well as by memoir, etc. We spent an hour perusing and could have stayed longer. What was most fantastic was the collection. Yes, all the newest, most up-to-date cookbooks were on display but also community coil-bound cookbooks and other unusual gems. Used books are also included among the mix so that you can score some really great deals - I found two copies of a huge, fantastic grilling book in very good condition for $11 each! Can't wait to visit again and bring friends. The woman at the front counter, who I'm assuming may be the owner, was friendly and very sweet. Cafe in the back with drinks and snacks, too."

And complimentary giftwrap. That's a win!"

Check.This place is a neighborhood gem that I'm almost sorry to be writing about because I'm afraid it will become too popular and I won't be able to squeeze into the weekly Thursday night dinners anymore.

1401,B1Bf8SnkYPEKaqcUepwfTQ,9/7/2017,5 star rating,I think I'm officially obsessed with this place. I popped in here once a couple of years ago during the day and loved browsing all of the foodie books. I also remember getting a rainbow cookie that blew me away. Fast forward to now- I just got home from their Thursday night eggplant parmesan dinner. OMG. The food was amazing. Everyone who works there is awesome. They let me taste a couple of wines before deciding which glass to order. The amount of food was insane. I took some eggplant parm home but still did manage to clean my dessert plate of peach cobbler with a generous scoop of homemade whipped cream. The vibe of this place is so unpretentious and incredibly charming. I will definitely be back. It's worth a trip to Greenpoint!
1402,B1Bf8SnkYPEKaqcUepwfTQ,5/17/2017,5 star rating,"So many cookbooks, it's a wonderful place to browse and take home something new, whether you're looking to master a new challenge in the kitchen or just a need a toolkit for quick weeknight dinners. They also have food memoirs, chef's memoirs, used cookbooks, and ones illustrated with comic-style drawings. In addition they have homemade cookies, coffee, food specials by the day, fountain pens, journals, cards, and a great seating area in the back. There's also a nice selection of food magazines and lots of the Short Stack editions, which are little pamphlet-like cookbooks, impeccably designed, each focusing on only one star ingredient. The last one I bought featured chickpeas and now socca is my go-to treat."

Theres plenty of seating available in the restaurant, when I went around 4pm on a Friday, there was only one other table occupied. There's meter parking on the street but its a busy street so you may need to wait. I ordered a chicken kabob with rice, a chickpea salad, a firni dessert, and both the vegetable and chicken samosas which I was delighted to see were heated in the oven not a microwave. They have 3 different types of sauces on the tables to try with the food. I wasnt a big fan of the chicken samosa, I found the chicken inside to be dry even with the sauces, but the potato samosa was okay. I must admit, I had the chicken and rice when I got home after a few hours, so I had to reheat it in the microwave which may have dried it a bit but I did like the chicken kabob and rice, it was flavorful, and a generous portion, also I smothered it with the green and white sauces, my favorite Afghan sauces. The chickpea salad was lemony and fresh, I liked that as well.  however, the dessert firni wasn't to my liking; it was pink not white as usual and the texture was like jello not the usual firm creme brulee-like and it didn't have pistachios sprinkled on top like most firni.  Final verdict, the food was good, I would go here again if I'm in the neighborhood. HAPPY YELPING!"

The cooks are laughing and coughing on top of your food. Let's start by the owner said something degrading about women thinking I didn't hear. Unfortunately, I did. There are tons of better eats out here! I waited an hour for 3 wraps that were never made-- and instead of being apologetic his response was too bad. Apart from that the food is gross I watched as the food was prepared for 30 mins as I sat there. Disgusting. No kitchen sani bucket no gloves- food and money handled with the same hands and the lettuce that was chopped came right out of an iceberg lettuce bag-- not washed or dry.

I got food with my bro tonight and was overcharged by as much as 40% above the menu price. At a minimum a similar meal everywhere includes a bottled soda (drink), but was charged separately, other items are way overpriced as well (stay away from the fries). The prices are similar to being in Times Square Manhattan. 2) Poor quality. The chicken tikka was dry and the rice was over-seasoned. The chicken tasted like it was made three days ago and it was just warmed up in the microwave. The rice was stale with a poor under-quality taste.3) Bad Taste. I can tell the food (including the fries which were very greasy) is made in a hurry. The poor quality with high amounts of grease and oil gives the food a bad taste because it's not prepared with the right ingredients, I can tell the meat is cheap and very under quality.Stay away from this place!AK"

I got a subway sandwich with a crazy amount of I don't even know what kind of sauce on it, and chicken kabobs.

Named after an influential group of Philadelphia journalists from the late 1800s, this is an excellent spot to grab a drink with a friend, frenemy, friends with benefits (you get the gist).Dining in the back is fun as there is a neat fireplace and a more tranquil vibe. Wouldn't recommend sitting by the front entrance as the tables are close together and it gets loud AF. A few pro-tips:- If you're a deviled egg fan come early for these bad boys. They do sell out.- The cocktails are excellent. I've tried everything from the Sunkist Sour (Chili pepper-infused blanco tequila, watermelon, lime, blanc vermouth, pink peppercorn) to the Clover Manhattan (Wild Turkey Rare Breed Bourbon, house sweet vermouth, cherry, Angostura bitters). Btw, the little dish they give you is parmesan cheese. Not dried fruit. Learn from my mistakes before you dump it in your drink *facepalm*.- Happy Hour is M-F 4-6.

I couldnt put my finger on it. Asked the other person in our party who ordered it as well. Told me detected cucumber and dill. The last drink I got was a Ramos Gin Fizz. It was delightful! We were seated in a booth. It was a Tuesday night. Pleased I could drink here. The waitress bringing our drinks was great.

But many others have opened and the service/food/drinks quality have quite honestly declined.I've frequented place over the years but came in for some drinks recently. The service was so bad. We literally waited 40 mins per drink. The food was okay. I went there again, for a night cap with friend. The bartender was totally ignoring us and catering to their friends at the bar. So yea, I think I'm good for now."

But, the lack of lighting be damned. The atmosphere is pretty great overall.The issue? For some reason the waitress seemed to hate us. Like despise our very existence. She rarely checked to see if we might need a drink. I asked for salt. She was probably thinking about her next tattoo and forgot. When it came time to pay the bill, there was no eye contact. No warmness. Just a snatch and grab (I felt so used). The hostess and food runners were lovely and delightful. The location is fantastic and, again, the food was so good! I can't help but think the Clover experience could be better without a waitress who seems to be wishing her table died in a fire."

While the downstairs was beautifully decorated and had the moody lighting going for it, the private room was pretty bland. When we first arrived into the room there was a small open bar set up. The bartender was great. He was friendly and personable. They also set up some small snacks before coming in like an onion dip, chips and popcorn. I tried the dip which was pretty good and also the chips which were very stale for some reason.For our dinner we got some dishes to try family style: MIXED GREENS SALAD: Good mix of items and a nice salad. MUSHROOMS A LA GRECQUE: Mushrooms were average. They came with some giant crostini baked with cheese. The whole dish was just ok. The mushrooms were so overpowering and the crostini was just bread and cheese. It didn't flow well together at all. ROASTED COD: The cod itself was well cooked but super bland. And they put some blacked oil on top of it that just did not add any taste apart from burnt bits? The creamed corn the cod was sitting on was really good. And there was also some steamed clams on the dish as well that felt extraneous. HANGER STEAK: Hanger steak's flavor was good. It was pretty chewy though. Additionally, it was covered with peppers on top that were actually cooked pretty well as well. BROCCOLI RABE: Everything was completely charred. No flavor except for burnt. ROASTED HEIRLOOM CARROTS: Perfectly cooked carrots. Flavor was good as well. The brown butter really elevated the dish.DOUGHNUT HOLES: Yum! Really good donut holes and the chocolate sauce it came with was really great and really added to the dish. CHEESECAKE: Great cheesecake with a lovely crust. The strawberries and honey were also a nice topping. Additionally, the servers told us they are unable to give us boxes to take food to go which was disappointing since we did have lots of food left and it is sad to see it all go to waste like that. All in all, food here was a complete disappointment though there were some good items that popped up here and there."

Located in FiDi, in the six floor atrium of The Beekman hotel, once home to many of the great publishers of classic writers such as Edgar Allen Poe, lies Temple Court; A truly suberb drinking and dining establishment. We were greeted by our host, Raymond, who gave us a wonderful history of the building over almost 200 years! Not only EAP but Thoreau, and Emerson and more!We were seated right next to a wonderful portrait of Edgar Allen Poe next to some curated bookcases right next to the atrium opening six floors up. It was aesthetically beautiful and modernized in only the way it needed to be; the lighting and decor still held an old world aesthetic. Edison bulbs, wood and leather furniture, curated decor on the shelves, etc. very nice. Other rooms had beautiful stained glass and chandeliers. The entire hotel is a historic work of art to be honest. Our party of 4 tried a wide selection of the cocktails and they were all good, but the party as a whole definitely gravitated toward two of them in particular. ""Osaka at 6PM"" with Vodka and Passionfruit, and the ""Jessica Pressler"" with Fruit Punch Liqueur, sparkling wine, and a select apéritif from the bartender. By the end of the 3 hour visit, we were all drinking Osaka's though. Thats how good they were. We started our meal with a 1/2 dozen oysters and the crispy onion dip with kettle fried house chips. The chips were salty and crispy, and had a delicious thin rind; The dip was sweet and tangy with little house fried onions on top. Very good.We all shared different mains. My partner had the mussels, which had a wonderfully tangy-sweet and hearty tomato sauce, along with delicious toasted and oiled bread. It was good I would love to see just the bread and sauce as an app! I also tried the Red Snapper which had a wonderfully fruity sauce (mango, I believe) and was served with an array of delicious sliced vegetables (mostly squashes). Very tasteful and hearty with a light fish flavor that very balanced with the accompanying sauce/puree. The hangar steak looked good, though I didnt try it. Our guest loved it though. For my personal main I had the Crispy Pork Panchetta on a bed of Creamed Polenta with Cippollini Onions with an herb salsa verde. I will say the description the waiter gave was a but different from the menu, and the menu description was a bit off too, from what I eventually got.... But it was completely Ab-Fab! Presented on a bed of creamy polenta, it was a slow braised pork with a fine crispy skin (they described it as a sausage when it was really more like a cutlet or porkchop with a light herb mix rather then straight verde salsa that you might expect.) It was fabulous. I think I only got about half of it after everyone kept sampling it, which is a sure compliment to the chef. We ended the night with the peach profiterole with caramel and candied nuts; and carrot cake with vanilla ice cream. Both desserts were great. One of our guests also had a dish deliciously dense chocolate cookies and ice cream. I had only a small bite of the cookie and ice cream with the ice cream accompanient. My mouth has been yearning for these flavors and all my cocktails have been found lacking ever since. Anticipate 2-3 hours for the full experience being all courses and 2-4 drinks. But if you can do it, I highly recommend. Superb from start to finish. It was a wonderful experience. Do yourself a gavir and come here on another quiet Sunday."

Thankfully, we dined at this restaurant during Restaurant Week, otherwise the restaurant would have seemed very expensive for what it was.""What type of water do you want?"" was the first thing our waiter said when we got to our table at Temple Court. No ""hello"" or ""how are you."" It really exemplified the service we experienced the rest of the evening. The service culminated in two waiters getting into a verbal alteration, in which one of them told the other to ""shut the f up"" in front of the entire dining room. One waiter walked off in a huff and hit one of the diners at a neighboring table, whose husband then had to turn around and say ""excuse me, you just hit my wife."" No manager showed up and the maitre d was too busy chatting with tables of regulars and people standing outside the restaurant. Overall, our waiter was gruff and inattentive.The appetizer course was the best part of the meal. The tuna tartare was delicious, one of the better iterations in recent memory. The agnolotti was also great - the pasta was perfectly cooked.The entrees were inconsistent. The chicken was overcooked but the sauce was tasty. The halibut was good, but arrived to the table lukewarm.For dessert, the buttermilk tart was very good. However, the cheese plate was deposited on the table without any description or explanation of what was what.The sommelier was knowledgeable and attentive.Overall, would not rush to return. There are several other superior options at a similar price point in the area."

1427,4MqJOLaeqCgBFQmMFPfe3g,4/3/2022,2 star rating,"This is an ""expensive even for New York"" Tom Colicchio restaurant.For starters, the waiter served me a complimentary "" amuse bouche ""  of fluke with rhubarb and onions.  It was good, but the dry dinner rolls that I spread it on tasted similar to those of a  supermarket-made brand.  For the price that I was paying for dinner, I expected hot, moist and freshly- baked Parker House rolls that instantaneously melt smeared butter!I ordered the stuffed quail appetizer, which had a Thanksgiving feel.  It was stuffed with plain-tasting croutons, raisins and fennel, and it came with an overly sweet side of red cabbage.  It did not taste anything like the made-to-perfection one that Tom Colicchio baked over 15 years ago when he was co-owner and Executive Chef at the Gramercy Tavern.My side order of puréed  potatoes required salt and flavor.  I could have done a better job at home.  This is how I do it:  Bake the potato and scoop the insides out.  Then add some warm milk, salt, white pepper and a dollop of fresh parsnip or celery root.  Mash the mixture lightly to keep it lumpy. Then drizzle some extra virgin olive oil , melted Irish butter and caramelized scallions on top.   Gail's puréed potatoes is a winner for dinner!For dessert, I had the Feuille de Brick.  Brick is a cooked mixture of wheat semolina, warm water and salt.  The finished product  looks similar to filo dough.  Brick is sold cooked in circular sheets whereas filo is sold raw.The stuffed pastry has its origins from the Anatolian ""borek"".  Variants of borek (stuffed pastry) are:  the Tunisian brik, Turkish borek, the Greek boureki, the Israeli bourekas, the Indian samosa, the Cuban empañada, the Jamaican patty and the French Feuille de Brick.Influenced by the popularity of the Tunisian brik in France especially during the month of Ramadan, the French make pastry leaves (feuilles) and purses out of the dough.Feuille de Brick is certainly trending on the Instagram pages of French pastry chefs!  The popular pastry's purse is stuffed with apples, almond cream and caramel ice cream.  Tom Colicchio's version left a lot to be desired because the Brick was too sweet, and only a scant amount of apples were at the bottom of the purse, but ice cream was tasty and tongue coating.To wash down my meal, I had some club soda, but it was flat, so exchanged it for one opened from the can instead of the one on tap.What should have been an extraordinary dining experience was a mediocre one.   An amateur chef must have been in the kitchen that evening.  My money was made wasted.  The meal was too expensive for its worth.I recommend that foodies abstain from Temple Court.  You will not have as heavenly a dining experience as you would at Craft.I have been going to Craft since it opened over 15 years ago.  It is my favorite Tom Colicchio restaurant."

The ambiance at entry and throughout is great. It's got an old New York feel, dimmer and intimate lighting. Vintage and library type accents. Picturesque views inside. Food was full of flavor, menu had some classics as well as some uniquer combos and ingredients. Ingredients felt fresh and well put together. I didn't have any complaints. I started with the tuna tartare. Pretty much what I'd expect but with a nice, uniquer twist with the uni add. Scallops were meaty, well cooked and seasoned. Protein and accompanying veggies were all fresh. Carrots side add on was a table favorite. Apple dessert was nice. I felt the plating was also great. Service was good. Helpful with all requests and didn't over fuss us. I'd say give this place a shot!"

Had reservations for Le Gratin, but husband wanted to eat here so I canceled... wish I hadn't.The space itself is breathtaking... as a lover of all things Victorian, it is romantic and soaring and beautiful.However...Sat at bar around 11:30am, only 2 other parties who left shortly after we sat. (Heard the bartender tell one that their meal ... of croissants and fruit had been comped... was a warning signal.)Ordered espresso with a side of steamed milk... 20 minutes later, it arrived. Not so hot... temp OR service.My husband asked how the 'Farm Egg' in the Brussels Sprouts with Black Trumpets  dish were prepared... he didn't know.A server came over to help, told us the eggs were served scrambled over the sprouts with baby eggplant? (Nope. No baby eggplant to be seen... nor would we have wanted it. I think she honestly didn't know that black trumpets are MUSHROOMS.)I ordered the breakfast sandwich, eggs medium.Came out eggs hard, sausage pink on the inside and undercooked...Bartender was a bit brusque and definitely harried... and obviously new to brunch as the waitress who told us there were eggplant in the eggs said 'welcome to brunch.'I apologized as I asked for the sausage to be cooked more (I shouldn't have.)Out comes another plate for me ... my $23 egg sandwich... made anew, but this time egg still hard, sausage burnt on outside still pink inside AND a burnt roll.I was especially disappointed as I'm a longtime old school follower of Tom Colicchio, and I expected better. I GET that good help is hard to find... but cmon, guys. Your staff should know the menu. Coffee shouldn't be cold unless it's iced. It's not that hard to cook an egg medium, sausage till it's not pink, a roll toasted nicely.STILL regretting canceling that Le Gratin resie... Now I know better."

But for some reason a couple of weekends ago I was wandering around the Atlantic Terminal (really, let's not kid ourselves, I was buying more than I needed at Target) and smelled that smell. It smells like cake that's still in the oven and cheese mixed with dairy and rainbow sprinkles. Something to that effect. I went with the smallest size possible of their birthday cake remix thing concoction. Really its just cake batter ice cream, brownie mashed up, syrup, sprinkles. Walked part of the way home with it and can honestly say while it was great going down this ice cream for some reason never settles well. It's almost too rich and I never say that about ice cream ever. My friend has watched me with complete revulsion house more than one should ever consume in one sitting with ice cream and this wee itty bitty cup sent me over the edge. Also it costs you around $7 for the smallest size and that's robbery. I'd rather just go to baskin robbins or carvel."

I love the fact that Atlantic mall has this spot for at least 7 years I have known. Chocolate devotion and Cheesecake fantasy, love it size, with waffle were our picks last Sunday. No need to mention how good is chocolate devotion but the berries of the CF were all frozen and it kills your teeth. As they melt ice-cream gets watery. Maybe skip that one and try another signature choice.They have 2-3 tables, even the line was long, they manage well and serve you while you are in line so you enjoy your time while waiting to pay :) 2 med. size with waffles are about $14."

This most recent visit included them being out of fudge, caramel, graham crackers, and whip cream!-all of which seem kinda like staples in such stores.Furthermore, I asked for a Frappe and was informed that they don't serve them there when they had at least 3 signs advertising them around their store.  What's worse is that they said they could do a shake instead--now maybe I'm just being overly judgmental but it doesn't seem like there is that much difference in between the ingredients.Unfortunately, I will not be returning to this establishment again."

Big mistake. I don't know how anyone can eat this. It was SO SWEET! And mind you, I have a sweet tooth, but eating this felt like I was just asking for diabetes. The first few bites were good, but after that, it was just too much.The flow seemed kind of weird to me. So we ordered the flavor we wanted near where the ice creams and ""cold stone"" was, which is basically right by the entrance. The guy told us to go pay while he made it so we went. But then we had to walk back towards the entrance to get our ice cream again. They put up dividers to separate the line to order from the seating area so we had to push our way past people still waiting to order to get our ice cream again. Not the most efficient set up here.Also, not sure if the ""cold stone"" where they mixed our ice cream was working properly or not but our ice cream was basically melting when we got it.

It was such a good decision! The berry napoleon is MASSIVE, and definitely meant for two. It comes with layers of fruits, pastry cream and pastry dough and dollops of whipped cream. It wasn't too sweet for me, but the cream was definitely heavy.The real winner with the vanilla chai latte. It had the cardamom-y spices of a warming chai latte on a cold day but well balanced by the light vanilla flavors. 10/10 would definitely get again."

It was perfect and warm and pairs so well with the ice cream and whipped cream.The apple crumble cake was also so good too, all the layers make sense, the crumbly top which seemed like it was made out of cinnamon and hardened sugar was so good.

My cousin and I took our desserts to go, and the staff was very friendly. I really liked their blue velvet cake. It was very moist and I liked the nuts in it. The fruit tart and the banana cream pie were also good. I wasn't a huge fan for the Oreo cupcake because it was very dry. I would definitely want to come back to try more desserts, and possibly chill in the dining area."

Of course one always want everything. Literally every time I enter I feel like a kid in the candy store.Forego the cheesecake and ordered the oatmeal raisin cookie.. I was informed it now contains pecans I was a little put off but decided to go for it. I honestly felt it wasn't as good as my plain oatmeal raisin of the past. I wish there was a choice. But I ate it and drank my coffee.Staff very friendly and efficient.  Glad I checked in as I received a 10% off coupon for the bill.Definitely if you have a sweet tooth it will definitely be satiated. Martha's always a good time.My party also enjoyed, my friend did mention the apple pie wasn't as sweet as he would have thought I suggested adding the whip cream to each bite.

It was such a good decision! The berry napoleon is MASSIVE, and definitely meant for two. It comes with layers of fruits, pastry cream and pastry dough and dollops of whipped cream. It wasn't too sweet for me, but the cream was definitely heavy.The real winner with the vanilla chai latte. It had the cardamom-y spices of a warming chai latte on a cold day but well balanced by the light vanilla flavors. 10/10 would definitely get again."

It was perfect and warm and pairs so well with the ice cream and whipped cream.The apple crumble cake was also so good too, all the layers make sense, the crumbly top which seemed like it was made out of cinnamon and hardened sugar was so good.

My most recent experience at this mcdonalds was the worst i've seen in 25 years eating at mcdonalds. I order two breakfast meals #4 and #6. I said it 5 times and she charged me for two sandwiches without the meal. I don't understand how you can get this wrong. The menu says #4 or #6 meal. I did not say bacon egg mcgriddle, i said #4 which is the meal picture on screen. Then to make things worse, she told me she cannot cancel the order, so i will have to order the drinks and hash brown separately. Okay fine, i will order them separately. Then she tells me i cannot use the same credit card to purchase this meal. I was like WHAT???? I never heard such thing... fine forget it. I use another credit card. Now everything is ordered in two receipts, I wait for my food... I got my food and then drinks, but i ordered a large coffee... they try to stiff me with a small coffee. On top of all this, they forgot to add Apple pie to my order... but whatever just like i did not order it.I don't know what happened after the renovation. Maybe the workers pissed because all their coworkers got replaced by the new fancy ordering machines that was put in place. This Mcdonalds establishment definitely got way worse. I was fine dealing with service with no smile. I'm not big on customer service, i just order and go, but this is ridiculous!!!"

How about just take it off the menu? Either they don't give a flying f or they can't read. Don't even bother trying to call either. For a Mcdonalds to have 1 star it has to be really bad.

Besides being one of the least expensive bakery compared to its competitors, it has my favorite roast pork bun. It is fluffy as can be, with a good amount of sweet pork filling. Unlike other roast pork buns, this filling is made without a ton of chopped up fat. Instead, it is filled with delicious pieces of meat with a bit of fat tucked in for flavor. However, go early or they sell out, sometimes as early as lunchtime.The creamy egg tarts are another item that I buy regularly, along with their mango/green tea mochi. All other baked goods are quite decent too. Service is always friendly. Please go support this neighborhood gem from being another victim of covid."

And they also have other options like egg tarts, green bean bing etc. everything is good and this is my top 3 bakery in chinatown. Service: cash only. Very nice lady!Overall: 5 stars.

Others in the area (which might be more famous/located more centrally) are okay, but a little overhyped. Tao Hong is SO underrated and it's hands-down my favorite right now! They have decent egg tarts at a steal (2 for $1.80). My favorite unique dessert here is the taro roll cake, which is a soft heavenly floof of spongy cake, with sweet taro filling in the middle.

Besides being one of the least expensive bakery compared to its competitors, it has my favorite roast pork bun. It is fluffy as can be, with a good amount of sweet pork filling. Unlike other roast pork buns, this filling is made without a ton of chopped up fat. Instead, it is filled with delicious pieces of meat with a bit of fat tucked in for flavor. However, go early or they sell out, sometimes as early as lunchtime.The creamy egg tarts are another item that I buy regularly, along with their mango/green tea mochi. All other baked goods are quite decent too. Service is always friendly. Please go support this neighborhood gem from being another victim of covid."

For $30 or so I had a piece of pork with egg on rice, and a separate piece of miso cod. Pricey I guess?The pork bowl, while tasty, could have used a little more sauce and the egg wasn't consistently mixed in. The rice beneath the pork wasn't very flavorful. I loved the onions and the lightness, but couldn't really finish the rice because there just wasn't enough favor. And I wish they put a little more care into mixing the egg into the rice bowl (as you can see, it wasn't even)."

No guacamole on one bowl even though we paid for it, chips were cold, both bowls were cold, ie meat beans and rice all cold - had to microwave it.  I had double steak on mine and light lettuce, heap of lettuce on the top, just an awful way to end a Sunday and chipotle is usually the best.  Not this time.

I asked for the usual, a three-pointer bowl, which is a chicken and lettuce bowl with cilantro. When we finally got down to the lettuce section of the line, the person preparing the bowl started adding lime on top of the lettuce. I asked the person not to put lime on it, but when I did that, she looked at me strangely and told us that the lime is what killed all the germs off of the lettuce. That's why they don't have to clean it as well as everything else.WOW  if that is how they think  I'm not going back. Ignorance isn't contagious but germs and bacteria are."

We're all familiar with chipotle and it's highs and lows, and yet, given all the negatives we still somehow find ourselves back here craving more. I personally love a nice chipotle bowl when I'm craving ""fast food""--consider it a guilty pleasure. While the overall quality and taste of the food remains the same across chains, it is the service that determines how good the certain location is. I've been to this particular location several times now and I always experience terrible customer service. Either it's getting my order wrong, being way too stingy with the rice (like half a spoonful...really?), or making me repeat my order 4-5 times before anyone can process it. Like yes, I get it, it's a fast food chain but I still think being polite to the customer should hold some value. I've experienced better customer service at other Chipotle locations..."

Fine.On Wednesday I go again at around 8pm and they are out of hard shell tacos again. So I end up walking to the location on 53rd where they are very nice and had hard tacos.

And the line was at the door when i entered. The down side was that they gave me less food comparer to Chipotle in brooklyn. As the was preparing the food state thats a small portion. The server ignored me. He continued to just fix my food. A small amount of rice and chicken on a bowl. The food was good however i was disappointed in the amount. Normally i can not finish my food. Today i finished had nothing to take home. Chipotle in brooklyn take longer. I guess that is the difference.

There is a variety of different flavors, almost to the point where I had choice overload (good thing!). I tried the orange soda and vanilla combo, cherry flavor, and pina colada. They were all decent, but I didn't particularly love any of them. The main downside was that you can't do split flavors in one cup. When asking the worker which were the popular flavors, he basically lists out almost all of them haha. If I were to come back, I would try a fruity flavor."

Pretty good Chinese food(I've had the shrimp rolls and shrimp  with broccoli) or at least what I've sampled was decent. The place is small, with only 3 or 4 tables, and like Chinese fast food hole in the walls, negative on the ambience scale. The efficient and professional cashiers all seem like under-aged daughters of the owners, and all the staff, cooks and cashiers, seem to be wearing worn and ratty baseball caps. I felt so bad once I wanted to donate some of my unworn caps  but was afraid to insult  them.My tip, unless you live here, weather permitting, do take out, and bring the food by the concrete benches on the terrace by Costco. You get a magnificent view of the river and some hearty, quite delicious, Chinese food Cantonese American style."

I had to walk to the restaurant to get my food,since I already paid for it thru the app. When I get to the restaurant the nastiest lady, that looks like she hates her life,and treated me with horrible service said she tried to call me once but no answer(once,really lady)Also said I didn't leave my apartment number. The app automatically put my address on the order with out the apartment number. When I got home with my food. The food had been cooked twice and was saturated with oil. Tasted like it was seasoned with dried peanut oil. Disgusting!!! Never again,and thanks Yelp24 for your no help. Once you had my money you didn't care. Terrible experience Yelp24"

As a fail asian girl, I still haven't learned to cook all the food that my parents make, and living on my own, sometimes that craving can kick in at about.. oh, say 10 pm when I'm walking home from the train station. Got their Sweet& Sour Chicken one day and it wasn't too bad. A little weird that the sauce was put on the side, but I did have it as take-out. Not the greatest, but I didn't mind considering the options up here. It satisfied the craving for the moment."

That's how all food should be sold, by pure volume or weight. This is America, dammit, it's time we stepped it up like Teng Dragon does.

My experience here has only been to pick up my Mealpal so I can't really comment on the dining in service. The chicken milanese through Mealpal and is just very bland. It's like they use not even a hint of seasoning and just coat it with flour. The portion is pretty generous and I really like that they separate the chicken from the salad so that it doesn't get soggy but the chicken is just severely lacking in flavor. I'm not someone who ever adds extra salt or pepper to my food but I had to add some in order to make the chicken taste like something. The place is usually pretty busy so I'm definitely open to trying out other dishes here that might be more flavorful."

The staff are all helpful and friendly. Two recommendations, the portion of the foia gra we received was 1/3 less than the table next to us, please consider portion & the whipped cream vs. The ice cream ratio was 2:1. Would recommend the other way around.  All in all, I plan to go back and would recommend it to my friends."

Indoor dining was still closed at the time, and I didn't look at outside pictures before coming to Pascalou, so I was ecstatic to find out it has a heated outdoor structure to shield us from the harsh wind! Our friends were running late, but the staff of Pascalou were kind enough to let us sit down at an outdoor table while waiting for our friends!I ended up ordering the french toast here. I was craving something sweet and brunch-y and this helped satisfied my sweet tooth! The french toast had a slightly strange aftertaste to it, but it paired well with some of their syrup. I don't think they put butter on the french toast, so this felt more like eating bread and syrup. The fruit was delicious, but the majority of the fruit were melons, so I wish they added more of a variety to the fruit cup! Overall, I had a great experience here! I don't think I would eat their breakfast again, but Pascalou has such a wide variety of food on their menu, so I would try something else from there! I would come back again for their excellent service and hospitality!"
1580,TAm8Eauo0NQNHpjOAWXo2A,9/5/2022,2 star rating,"Just OK in general and definitely NOT recommended for anyone with a food allergy. We chose this restaurant after a day at the Met bc we were looking for a nice French experience and it looked cute in the pictures.  It wasn't that great.  The food was under salted and average, and more importantly to us, the staff and kitchen absolutely did NOT know how to handle a basic food allergy situation (We dine out a LOT and have literally never had so many problems.)  We told the waitress that my young-adult daughter is allergic to nuts and she said she would make sure there were no nuts in our food.  Not only did she not do that but there were hidden nuts in literally everything:  Pesto in the mushroom tartine that we asked for without the accompanying walnut salad so it would be nut free (and were assured it would not have nuts). Pesto in the escargot (?) (We've eaten escargot all over France and never experienced this). Nuts on the caesar salad (??) which they did manage to successfully remove.  Pine nuts in the spinach that was served with the sweetbreads, again not disclosed on the menu and the server denied that they were there.  Nuts on the asian eggplant which my daughter ordered (the kitchen realized this one at the last second and took it back and made it again). Just overall a total disaster, course after course.  By the time they re-made the eggplant and brought it out we were so uncomfortable my daughter didn't want to eat it (not to mention that it was unappetizing with half a head of iceberg lettuce sitting on top drizzled with orange sauce.)  When I mentioned how disappointing and stressful this whole thing was to the hostess she seemed shocked and then the waitress came over and repeatedly told me she had ""done her best."" To the restaurant's credit after I returned to my table they talked to their manager and comped our meal.  Overall, though, it was very disappointing.  More-so than a free meal we were looking to have a nice experience together and it was mostly derailed by the constant scrutiny and worry over the food plus the fact that we had to add salt to every dish to mask the blandness and really just did not enjoy it.  As an aside, the outside hut was cute but from where I was sitting I was looking out the hut's window at a large pile of garbage and recycling they had accumulated there and had to pull the little curtain closed to have some semblance of a nice ambiance. We would not go back or recommend this restaurant."

The menu you see out front is not the exact menu of the day so I would ask what is the menu for that day. I got the mushroom pita but instead of sour cream I opted for non dairy tahini! Definitely recommend!! It was packed when I came but it was prime tourist season so the line was a bit outrageous and you can tell the service was overwhelmed but the food came out quick."

Don't get me wrong: it was perfectly tender without being overly mushy, and I have no complains about texture. But somehow I felt the tahini and cilantro chutney served on the side failed to bring out the best in its flavors. Perhaps it would do better with a squeeze of lime and sea salt, as works wonders on tempura?"
1588,5XQgZQF-5N94bkQ2d_PJIQ,1/5/2023,5 star rating,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Miznon and was thoroughly impressed by the unique and delicious take on traditional falafel and pita. The falafel is served in the form of a large patty rather than a bunch of tiny balls, and it is absolutely insane - in the best way possible. The flavor and texture of the falafel were perfect, and the patty was a great change of pace from the traditional small balls. The pita bread was also top-notch and paired perfectly with the falafel.While the run over potato dish was just okay, the minute steak in pita with tahini and spicy green peppers is why I keep coming back to Miznon. It is absolutely delicious and has become one of my go-to dishes. The steak is tender and flavorful, and the combination of tahini and spicy peppers adds an extra layer of flavor and heat. I always look forward to indulging in this dish when I visit Miznon.Overall, I have to say that Miznon is by far the best place for falafel and pita that I have ever been to. The food is fresh, flavorful, and unique, and the service is always top-notch. I highly recommend Miznon to everyone and can't wait to visit again in the future"

Miznon offers a new kind of Mediterranean street food in Chelsea Market which is an indoor food and retail marketplace.I ordered the Rotisserie Broken Chicken and it came in a pita with tahini, za'atar, spicy green peppers, and scallions. The verdict is in and it was phenomenal. The chicken was absolutely delicious, very tender and full of flavor. Each bite was spectacular and I found myself savoring every morsel.The tahini, za'atar, and spices all blended perfectly with the chicken and added a depth of flavor that was unmatched. The pita was soft and warm, providing the perfect vessel for the delicious fillings. The spicy green peppers added a nice kick, making it a complete and satisfying meal.Overall, I highly recommend Miznon in Chelsea Market for anyone looking for a delicious, casual dining experience.

I added sriracha which really set it off. $11 for a modest sized bowl of soup, a single serving of sprouts and a soft drink seemed a little pricy to me but at least I didn't eat a gross cheeseburger.

The Smoke Thief has some really juicy pulled pork and some great vinegar slaw. There is also BBQ sauce slathered on there, which makes for a slightly messy yet very excellent and satisfying sandwich.The Italian Combo was also awesome - all the meats you know and love, arranged very neatly in a delicious, compact hero. As most people are complaining, it's a bit on the pricy side (which brings to mind The Bomb Sandwich from Sal, Kris & Charlie's in Astoria, which is at least 4 times as big for a few bucks less), but that's the premium you should expect to pay these days for a sandwich made by a guy with a beard in Brooklyn.Next time I need to go to Baked or Ikea, I'm definitely coming back here to try the Steak & Eggs Hero."

Tropical Jerks is a very popular take out restaurant in this area due to the lack of Jamaican cuisine. You would think that in an area populated with Caribbean culture, there would be a restaurant worthy of 5 Stars right? Wrong.This location is one of many in its franchise scattered throughout Nassau County and Queens. The line is sometimes outside of the door on weekends. You would think they are selling newly released Air Jordans. The main problem with this location is the service. Maybe their understaffed ? Maybe culturally, good manners are far and few in between? Mind you, my Grandparents are from Kingston, Jamaica. Clearly, as the other reviewers have noted, this is not just 1 unique observation. I've visited a few times primarily for Jerk Pork dinners, hot porridge, Cow Foot Soup and Curry Goat. The Jerk Pork is very good here. Spicy and moist. A nice charred outside to the pork. Big Up to the chef for that. However, The patties were mostly dough and a tablespoon of filling. They might as well take it off the menu. The same applies to the roti, Pea and Rice(singular) and Jerk Chicken. All in all, if you're in the neighborhood, this is your only choice."

1616,-4wt4Uau_zC5ilPMrIayxQ,12/30/2018,1 star rating,"This place is horrible, very bad service.  I just went there today to get some lunch and the lady at the counter has no level of service whatsoever.  She didn't speak well at all, has no clue about speaking to people, no professionalism whatsoever.  When placing the order, the TV in the front is very loud and poorly placed near the counter.  There is also music playing in the back kitchen area, right behind the counter.So the lady at the counter couldn't hear me well, but she was very impolite when she asked me to move and place my order in another spot.  After about 15 minutes, my order was ready, which is a rather long wait.  I originally asked for the sauces to be on the side (2).  So when she is bagging my food, I saw the guy who brought the food put them on the counter next to my container with the food.  But she didn't put them in the bag, so I politely asked her if the sauces on the side are in the bag.  She saw the sauces there and rudely picked them up and threw them in the bag.  I said thank and you have a nice day.  The food was just OK, nothing special.  I've had better Jamaican food at numerous other places.  I will never go back to this place ever again.  Furthermore, I've been noticing Jamaican women are increasingly more and more rude.  The person at the counter is who the public is contact with and the owner of this business needs to replace her.  Ironically, this restaurant is only a couple of blocks away from my train stop and it would've been great to grab dinner here on my way home."
1617,-4wt4Uau_zC5ilPMrIayxQ,11/17/2015,3 star rating,"I like their food, I get the jerk chicken, rice and peas and the oxtail often. A couple of times I've noticed that the jerk chicken is a little dry, but when it is moist it's absolutely delcious. The rice and peas are good and you can definitely taste the coconut and seasoning. I always get the oxtail gravy on the rice and peas for extra flavor. The oxtails are consistently good, but it is expensive as they do not serve it in a small. My only hangup with this place is the customer service. The cashier can be a little dismissive and sometimes I wonder if she wants to work at all. As to the actual establishment and its dine in qualities, it isn't appealing. I haven't eaten there because the lines can be long, the tables and chairs arent inviting and I dont want to be grilled by said cashier.Four stars for the food minus one for the service."
1618,-4wt4Uau_zC5ilPMrIayxQ,10/13/2015,3 star rating,"This Tropical Jerk is an ""ok"" place. I agree that the service can be better. These businesses need to realize that customer service is EVERYTHING. But anyway let's get to the food. My husband is obsessed with jerk chicken so he ordered that. He's American and I'm West Indian and I agree with most of the reviews, the jerk chicken is wack as hell. Soooooooo dry. Barely seasoned which is so unfortunate because it looked tasty. I ordered the oxtail which was reallyGood and well cooked. I mean this isn't the first time I ordered the oxtail. My eyes lit up when I sad that they had pepper shrimp but there was nothing peppery about it. It was S A L T Y my gosh! So pretty much Tropical Jerk, please re evaluate the seasoning for your jerk chicken and make sure it's not dry. And the customer service, PLEASE fix that. Thanks"

1620,-4wt4Uau_zC5ilPMrIayxQ,8/5/2017,4 star rating,"Wow! Based on the food I've had I'm actually surprised at the low ratings. I've been coming here about 2 years and because I'm a picky eater I mainly stick with the same thing, curry goat or oxtail. Always fresh, always piping hot and always prepared to order. My boyfriend loves the oxtail and the jerk pork. I've noticed a lot of people said the cashier has a bad attitude. To me she just seems more of a straightforward person. Place your order and go on about your business. No, she's not going to talk about the weather with you but I wouldn't call her rude. Keep in mind this place gets very busy, which means a long line/wait time. In my honest opinion if the line is out the door it's a good sign. The food is worth the wait. - star because, well that's life."
1621,-4wt4Uau_zC5ilPMrIayxQ,1/19/2019,1 star rating,Topical Jerk. I will not go there again. I am a bus operator I pass by this place many time. Wanted to try there jerk with rice and peas. Well I was in for a surprise Rice was HARD I could hear it hit plate like rain drops on a zinc and the chicken was Dry like the tropical sun.  Go elsewhere.
1622,-4wt4Uau_zC5ilPMrIayxQ,8/3/2019,1 star rating,"Nickle and Dime. This place is a joke, I've been here a few times and never had issues when  requested the lil cups of sauce for the jerk chicken just like all the other jamaican  restaurants in the queens area but today was different. I went in and when I asked for the sauce the guy bagging the food said 50 cents each !!! What a damn shame, that's what they are doing now. I paid it because it's not about the money it's the principle of not nickle and diming your customers and I like my chicken with extra sauce (so I wasn't going to deprive myself since the food was already orderedand paid for) but I wish I knew that before I put a tip in the jar. Lesson learned and that will be my last time there. Hopefully the extra $1 was worth it."

Second, they have a clover machine! Yep, it's here. Come and get it. Just don't ask me what it is, though, because I'm not quite sure myself! I think it's some sort of drip coffee?

The place was relatively empty, just a few people hanging around at some really nice tables. The staff is very friendly. I ordered my drink and it was ready super quick. The biggest thing was people had left their empty cups and paper on the tables when they were done. It took away from the cleanliness of the place. I know it's not the staff's fault, just rude of people to leave their trash behind. And it wasn't just one table, it was several. Just before I grabbed my drink I saw the lady who was working the register come out and start cleaning up."

This particular location is nice and spacious, and the interior is extremely clean. It's also got the benefit of being extremely well located right outside of the ACE subway stop. This Starbucks is slllooooooooow though. They seem to usually only have two or three people working (including cash register) even through theres a steady stream of customers, and the staff is pretty fumbly - this is the only place I've seen someone drop a drink behind the counter. Pretty regular location, with clean and nice interior. Service is a bit lacking."

I often see people come in and charge their electronics without buying anything, but I promise you I'm not that tacky. I bought a grande caramel iced coffee that was delicious. The super nice barista made it perfectly and he even asked me if I wanted some ice water (New York is HOT in the summer!).

I contacted seamless to correct the matter and they refunded me for the order. Replaced the order. Shortly after replacing the order for the correct items the restaurant calls me and starts being real disrespectful. Telling me I am bad people and flat out being rude!!!! That I only wanted items for free. Why would I want four of one order! It's nachos for crying out loud. Even if you felt something was wrong you still do not call you customer and yell at them. If you had a question or an issue about the refund contact seamless, they are the ones who provided the refund and felt I was correct for what I said. Never doing business with them again."

It's hot and the baguette size is always generous. I don't deal with the staff as I'm usually in and out. Today was not a good day. I ordered a chicken noodle soup bowl. It was ready within 5 mins of ordering. I grab it and get all the way back to work to eat my soup and it's friggen tomato soup! I double checked the receipt on the bag to make sure I didn't grab the wrong order. But no, it was most certainly my order and it said chix nood soup. So I had to wait until I left work to return the food since I'm allergic to tomatoes. When I tell the cashier she was so rude and unapologetic.  She treated me like I was the one who messed up! She handed the bag off to another worker and said you have her the wrong soup then asked if I wanted to keep it. No! Give me what I paid for! After that I was honestly disappointed they didn't try to makeup for the inconvenience.  Typically when a food establishment fucks up they offer something complimentary.

I came here to study, this is why I gave two stars. This place is noisier than the Mets stadium when they are up by one point.

They finally decided to change the order but in the meantime the supervisor, Katy was yelling at her employees in front of us which made us feel uncomfortable. When the supervisor noticed I was talking about her to my family member, she came at me and asked me ""do you have something to say"" in a very nasty attitude and I told her I did have something to say, I said her attitude was disgusting and that she shouldn't be talking to customers like that if she is a supervisor. Her attitude was threatening and unprofessional. Panera, do better with your customer service."

I don't know if you changed the turkey that you usually use for this sandwich or what, but the turkey was cut almost a half inch thick. It was disgusting I had to throw it out. Like a big slab of rubber. Also. I got the broccoli Mac and cheese and the pasta was so soft it was gross. Had absolutely no texture or taste. Very disappointed I wasted my money here.

It's hot and the baguette size is always generous. I don't deal with the staff as I'm usually in and out. Today was not a good day. I ordered a chicken noodle soup bowl. It was ready within 5 mins of ordering. I grab it and get all the way back to work to eat my soup and it's friggen tomato soup! I double checked the receipt on the bag to make sure I didn't grab the wrong order. But no, it was most certainly my order and it said chix nood soup. So I had to wait until I left work to return the food since I'm allergic to tomatoes. When I tell the cashier she was so rude and unapologetic.  She treated me like I was the one who messed up! She handed the bag off to another worker and said you have her the wrong soup then asked if I wanted to keep it. No! Give me what I paid for! After that I was honestly disappointed they didn't try to makeup for the inconvenience.  Typically when a food establishment fucks up they offer something complimentary.

I came here to study, this is why I gave two stars. This place is noisier than the Mets stadium when they are up by one point.

The prior pizzeria was not successful and the owner Tony and his family came in and redid the place over completely. In my opinion it's one of the best pizzeria's in the neighborhood. They have brick oven pizza and plenty of other dishes to choose from. I have not had a bad dish ever. The employees work very well together right down to their delivery people. It's nice when businesses remember your name and you get to know them on more of a personal level. A great sign of a business is to see the owner present. Tony who is young is there most of the time and works hard behind the counter. Gabe who I believe has been with Tony since the beginning is very loyal and represents the business well. There are only two spots in Bayridge I go to for pizza and Nonos is one of them. The restaurant is clean, has great food, extremely fair prices, and has fantastic customer service. I would highly recommend them1/5/2019Stopped in for some home made soup and grilled chicken and vegetables. Everything is very, very fresh!

A few tables outside and absolutely no one inside during late lunch.While looking through the menu, was given a bowl of chips and side salsas for each person. Good flavor in the salsa and the chips are hearty. For the meal, ordered the BBQ Duck Burrito ($18) and a Spicy Margarita ($12). Burrito is split into two stuffed tortillas, topped with a pineapple sauce and rice/beans on the sides. Meat is bountiful and slathered in BBQ sauce, needing no extra hot sauce on top. Spicy margarita balanced out the sweetness while the rice and beans cleared the palate.Service here is great as we got refills quickly throughout.

Located in Kips Bay not too far from the movie theater; Baby Bo's has warm, zany vibes and a menu with all the classics. Like any standard Mexican restaurant, they'll serve you a basket of tortilla chips and salsa. They serve their chips warm, which is always nice, and the salsa is pico de gallo style - my favorite! Wonderfully seasoned with a nice acidity.I had the Suizas Enchiladas with chicken. It was two enchiladas in a creamy salsa verde served with rice & beans. I will say, they have some of the best refried beans I've ever had. I think they may mix in some sort of tomato sauce?"

We didn't have reservations, but they were able to seat us.The drinks were average, nothing spectacular, but it was happy hour. $6 for margaritas? I am so game! I got the beef fajitas and it was fine. Nothing out of ordinary. It did what a fajita ought to do. It is nice to spend less than $50 on meals and drinks so no complaints whatsoever. Definitely recommend this place if you live around the area. Note: Just because I was able to be seated without a reservation does not necessarily mean this is a place that you will be seated all the time whenever you go. The place is small and there were ppl pouring in as time went by. I didn't feel rushed out or anything, but you can tell this place is pretty popping.

Baby Bo's is a small restaurant but I think that adds to the charm of the place.Baby Bo's Cantina is a nice place to enjoy a taco Tuesday night or just an amazing authentic meal.  Immediately, my friend and I were invited to sit at a table or the bar and we chose the bar. The bartender was amazing and our drinks were so delicious and on point. As we sat and gobbled down our amazing chicken.. pulled pork ... and steak tacos, we admired the traditional art on the walls.

The inside's pretty spacious which was nice. There were maybe 3 tables and also bar seating area. It's pretty pricy, but comparable with other fruit tea stores (like Debutea).

Yes, but it was quality!! I ordered one of their specials, Taro n' Taro Smash, with 30% sugar. It was like a slush almost, not milk tea, and fully real taro at the bottom. It was very filling and I wish they mixed it together because it got really starchy and like I was drinking potato at the end lol. My sister and cousin got the Taro Bobo and Brown Sugar Milk Tea, which they both said were average. Quality ingredients, but I think recipes/execution could be better, especially given the price. Plus, I docked another star because I tried to be friendly with the baristas, but was met with unsmiling faces. That definitely is something that could be easily improved."

I had the Four Seasons Oolong Milk Tea and it was really good. It was a bit pricey, but I really liked it. It's honestly one of the best random boba's that I've ever had.

The cups and shop was aesthetic and the drinks are good quality. We got the Lychee Dragonfruit, Mango Pomelo, and Rose Jasmine Milk Tea. Lychee Dragonfruit - refreshing and sweet enough to satisfy any sweet tooth. The dragonfruit was perfectly understated and a good balance to the Lychee. Mango Pomelo - Pretty standard, the mango taste was a bit light but it was still a decent drink. Rose Jasmine Milk Tea - Extremely fragrant, the rose mixed well with the jasmine tea and didn't taste like bitter rose petals, even at 50% sugar. Overall, I really enjoyed getting drinks here and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for quality boba drinks!"

I don't think the mango sago lived up to the hype and price, but I'll certainly be back to try their more normally priced milk teas. 3/5 mango pomelo sago: I'm so torn on this one. On one hand, interesting drink with textured bits from the sago + mangos; on the other, I was initially very disappointed it costs ~$8 after tax and it wasn't an immediate ""wow this is good"" at that price point. I grew to like it as I drank more of it, though. It wasn't very sweet or refreshing at first, as they used raw mangos and not ripe ones for the drink. I have a sweet tooth so this was a miss. You also have to mix very well before drinking (which is hard to do with a plastic straw in a tall, narrow cup) otherwise you'll get mouthfuls of flavorless sago. 5/5 service: nice staff who answered questions and minimal wait time."

There's some busy art on the walls, presumably for sale if you favor the Black Magic Marker School of painters.When you order espresso, they give you the lemon wedge and the cup of fizzy water. I'd take a star off for not having any kind of rubbish bin inside or out of the store to dispose of the very disposable cups, but charity begins at home; likewise, I do not provide a garbage can for random passers-by to throw out their shit, so I get it. On the other hand, I'm not selling flavored hot water in paper cups out of my front door, so there's that. Bottom line, I always round up for myself, so I do it for everyone else, too."

And a few years ago, I discovered Terremoto, just close enough to Chelsea Market, yet tucked away on 15th St.I immediately fell in love with their coffee aaaaaand the coffee shop! My go-to drink is the purple rain latte. Every sip is always rich & smooth. There's always a consistency of flavor & texture, regardless of which barista makes it. And I completely adore this coffee shop! It's elegant with a classy ambience & a touch of character. I'm big fan of supporting local artists & Terremoto does exactly that by hanging original artwork done by locals. And another thing I love about this shop is how they bring in a bit of South American culture into the mix. :)If you don't swing by while in the area, you're truly missing out. And it's shops like Terremoto that make you want to come back for more."

Definitely do not judge this book by its cover... after a curious pondering, my first visit was a surprise of artsy ambiance and chill weekend vibe (instagram worthy... I'm not an IG cool kid but if I were, this would be my summer photo dream!) The prices are a bit high but it's new york, high quality ingredients, and the staff seem happy... so I'd gladly pay $1-2 more for a relaxing place with good business owners.It's also pretty greek, in an authentic Astoria way... meaning it's just real people doing real things, speaking greek along the way.

Why can't I order my morning goodies without being met with a look of absolute confusion. I'm sorry but you are running a business and way before you moved into these parts, this was my old neighborhood where everyone knew everyone. I respect change, however, new business owners should also be humble and cognizant of their surroundings. I mean isn't that the whole premise of business. Know your customer. After all it's their wallets that's bringing you your income. Any business owner that doesn't understand that in my opinion is foolish. I get their silly thinking. There's a certain demographic that's frequenting your establishment and you feel like that's who you must cater to. Wrong answer! A lot of the old neighborhood is still left and reflect a significant population here in Sheepshead Bay. So don't be foolish, man! Back in the day you went to the morning bakery, ordered your cheese danish and morning coffee without complication. It feels as though they are only cordial to their own kind. If you come in and speak English, they are very short and seem to lack patience if you ask about their treats featured in the glass. I asked this morning what a particular goodie was and I got Beezgotty as she looks at me like a fool. Bear in mind... this was resembling a flat sheet cake. No sweety, it's Biscotti!!!! I'm not that person that pokes fun if someone pronounces something wrong. However the arrogance on these people is amazing and uhh I just cant‍ Those of you that know me know I might tolerate this if the product was amazing! Their stuff is just okay and there's not much competition here. Today I got a semi raw blueberry muffin! Not cool!"
1836,dscslnybf6U6T8NNaiQ6lw,8/25/2020,1 star rating,I went in to get coffee & breakfast today & left without ordering anything once I saw that none of the staff were actually wearing their masks. I'll skip getting COVID & go to another cafe instead.
1837,dscslnybf6U6T8NNaiQ6lw,4/3/2019,3 star rating,Stumbled in for some coffee before going to the bank.  It's a tiny place with a waitress and a few dessert options if you wonna sit down.  The dessert didnt look too appealing to me but the coffee was good.
1838,dscslnybf6U6T8NNaiQ6lw,7/31/2020,5 star rating,I have never had a bad experience here. I would say my only qualm is the staff is a little rigid and it wouldn't kill them to smile or be a little more hospitable but I think that's cultural. Otherwise the food is always fresh and delish! The shnitzel is always amazing!
1839,dscslnybf6U6T8NNaiQ6lw,9/18/2016,4 star rating,"I stop by here every morning for a coffee. Its a very cozy cafe that also serves breakfast options like egg & cheese sandwiches and well as the usual muffins and croissants. It was another warm day today, so I opted for a tall iced coffee with a shot of almond flavoring. Definitely stop by here if you're ever in this part of Brooklyn."
1840,dscslnybf6U6T8NNaiQ6lw,12/3/2018,5 star rating,The mushroom barely soup is the best in Brooklyn if you ask me. They always have a great selection of fresh homemade soups. Their wraps have the freshest ingredients and very delicious. The ladies at the counter are always so polite. It's a cramped little spot and seems stressful to work here but they ladies are always smiling and welcoming.
1841,dscslnybf6U6T8NNaiQ6lw,5/2/2018,1 star rating,"I used to love this place a lot. Me and my friend used to order their soups, sandwiches and bakery stuff all the time! I even had to go to the atm because this place accepts ONLY CASH.One day we ordered soup and the person who took an order was the owner. While we were waiting, the other girl(she didn't know we were served) simply asked us if we need help. When the owner heard that and he started yelling at my friend with such an attitude like ""I TOLD YOU TO WAIT"". WTH?! Honestly I'm disgusted and disappointed that the person who runs this place doesn't know how to treat customers. I also noticed that they hire new people all the time. But whatever because their staff as rude as the owner.Ok so bottom line : food is really good but IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO GIVE US AN ATTITUDE BECAUSE HEY WE PAY YOUR BILLS."
1842,dscslnybf6U6T8NNaiQ6lw,3/29/2021,2 star rating,"Been going here for over two years now and I love their pastries, however their coffee is always a hit or miss. My biggest issue with this place is that no one, literally not a single staff member wears a mask. They keep it on their chin which is ridiculous cause there's little to no ventilation in the cafe and they're breathing down on the drinks and food. The place was one of my favorites but I literally feel like covid is breathing down my shoulder whenever I attempt to step inside. Also, they have a sign outside that reads ""wear a mask"" and they literally let anyone in, maybe 1 out of the 5-10 people who are on line there are wearing a mask. It's so upsetting. I loved this place and still do but I'm not going back until they start abiding by the safety regulations."
1843,VexbNobbahnCexe693zWCA,11/22/2020,1 star rating,I was sick for 2 days after eating here. Very upsetting because I used to like it but I can't take a chance to go back in the future after this experience. Be careful if you eat there cause it's good but risky
1844,VexbNobbahnCexe693zWCA,3/1/2018,4 star rating,"I have to say that when I'm hungry and just want something cheap and fast, I've stopped by here a few times. For me it's good and it satiates my hunger. I like getting the hard bean tacos or the shrimp burritos. It's very budget friendly - I never pay more than $10, with a few seats inside if you want to sit and eat as opposed to doing takeaway."
1845,VexbNobbahnCexe693zWCA,1/3/2021,5 star rating,"I used to order from here all the time in the mid 2010s and forgotten it was around. It is not authentic Mexican food but as long as you accept it for what it is, it is delicious. I particularly like the quesadillas which have a nice crisp."
1846,VexbNobbahnCexe693zWCA,10/16/2020,4 star rating,"I thought this place closed, bc of the pandemic, but I was wrong!  They were just renovating!  The place looks great!  And, The food still taste great!  My favorites: the chicken burrito, super fajita & their chili!  I can eat this everyday!"
1847,VexbNobbahnCexe693zWCA,10/12/2021,1 star rating,"Nasty. Chips were okay but fairly stale. Quesadilla was gross -- mushy,  so small (like not even enough for a 12 year old) cheese was almost flavorless and the tortillas were literally mush as if they were raw."
1848,VexbNobbahnCexe693zWCA,4/22/2021,5 star rating,I actually really like Taco Today. Very friendly service with a great atmosphere. Every thing here has very good flavor and taste. Fantastic customer service! Taco Today: Super happy.
1849,VexbNobbahnCexe693zWCA,10/10/2021,1 star rating,"This place is disgusting. Regardless of the type of meat you choose, it gets put in the deepfryer and then thrown into a tortilla, grease and all. Go literally anywhere else. Also say they close at 10 but its really 9. Incredibly rude staff too"
1850,VexbNobbahnCexe693zWCA,7/2/2020,1 star rating,I wanted to give them another shot and try them when they reopened after being closed during Covid. The food  is just so bland. No flavor or seasoning whatsoever. I can make a better quesadilla with Kraft cheese at home.
1851,VexbNobbahnCexe693zWCA,7/11/2020,5 star rating,Looks like they just reopened after some renovations and I'm honestly liking it. The place has a nice clean vibe and the food is great for the price. Would definitely continue ordering from here.
1852,VexbNobbahnCexe693zWCA,6/29/2020,5 star rating,"I love this place.  If you haven't try it.  You must to try it ,    The food is good and the place it's new ,  Fresh tortilla home made   I recommend it.  And they just reopen."
1853,EzKvmyYk-7xQZ47Me-NDwg,1/11/2022,4 star rating,"Peach aloe fruit tea is the bomb!!! It tastes fresh- it already comes with toppings so no need to order more. Only one size (L). Sadly, they don't have jasmine milk tea but their Vivi bubble milk tea tasted good. The boba was a little overcooked though. Boba prices are getting darn high now!!!"
1854,EzKvmyYk-7xQZ47Me-NDwg,12/2/2022,3 star rating,Drink was okay...maybe I ordered wrong but I don't love blended up lychee. Made the drink bitter
1855,EzKvmyYk-7xQZ47Me-NDwg,4/13/2021,4 star rating,"buy 3 get 1 free promo, made to perfection. If you're hungry, try the popcorn chicken (basil). It's taiwanese style if you've ever had it before and def on point. I like that they use the plastic sealed covers on the cups here. Makes a big difference especially with today's risk of Covid."
1856,EzKvmyYk-7xQZ47Me-NDwg,8/24/2021,1 star rating,"Holding a board at the door says Boba + Chicken cost $10, then cost me $13, denied the fact I requested them the Combo. total. I spoke to them no ice for my Boba due to I cannot take ice, handed me a cup of ice cube with Boba. As for the cups fell on the floor, they simply wiped and put them back, DURING THE COVID19 period!I watched them this whole time and make sure these cups wouldn't be my order. This my first time I felt so wasted in a Boba store.I don't know what's going on on the service, if they were not trained kids there, you'd better let customers know so they won't get themselves sick from buying drinks there."
1857,EzKvmyYk-7xQZ47Me-NDwg,6/27/2021,2 star rating,"The two stars is for the young lady behind the counter, she was very helpful. When I asked what was popular, she said taro and lychee. I've had a taro  milkshake before, and it was delicious. I figured this would also be delicious, it was not. The best thing about the drink,  it tasted cold.. which helped because it was very hot outside. Apart from that, we didn't drink it. My son said he also didn't like his strawberry float. He was so disappointed, this was his first time trying bubble tea. I told him not to be disappointed, we would try another bubble tea place."
1858,EzKvmyYk-7xQZ47Me-NDwg,7/23/2022,1 star rating,"Purchased Popcorn Chicken Bento and  Pork Chop Bento on 7/22/2022.  I can taste the chicken was repeating fried, not fresh."
1859,EzKvmyYk-7xQZ47Me-NDwg,12/14/2019,4 star rating,I usually come to Vivi to get their popcorn chicken and not any of their drinks. They have some bomb ass popcorn chicken and I'd highly recommend anyone to give it a try.This location is pretty puny with limited seating. The place does get packed at times so expect a wait. The highlight of this location is the mirror that they have set up on the right side of the wall as you walk into the shop.
1860,EzKvmyYk-7xQZ47Me-NDwg,12/22/2021,1 star rating,"I'm sorry but this is the worst boba place Ive ever been to. We ordered the coffee, taro, and taro creme brulee. The coffee and taro are so bland. The taro creme brulee did not taste like what its supposed to be. It taste like sand. I guess the only positive thing I can say about this place is the honey boba itself weren't too bad."
1861,EzKvmyYk-7xQZ47Me-NDwg,6/16/2021,5 star rating,"Recommend. Quick and kind service. Good flavors, would definitely buy again. I was able to taste the coffee and lychee!"
1862,EzKvmyYk-7xQZ47Me-NDwg,2/27/2021,3 star rating,"I really like TS's coffee latte so I wanted to try other bubble tea shops to compare. Wow. I know it's not the same drink and milk teas are generally very bland, but it has such a weird taste. The extra toppings didn't help either. I ordered the tea with regular amount of sugar, not that I could tell since it was pretty watered down. All the toppings, except for the boba which had a slight flavor, was so bland. It's cheaper so obviously it's not the same quality as TS, CYT, etc. I probably ordered the wrong drink. I should've gotten a slushee or fruit tea or that brown sugar milk tea."
1863,WxNlqGSsj_2TCodkx9Sa4A,6/15/2019,4 star rating,"This store is a small deli that serves hot and cold food. The prices are reasonable for manhattan food. I have tried the breaded chicken ceasar salad, italiano panini, and chicken parmigiana. There are a few seats around the window area. The workers work at an extremely fast pace. You will never stand in the checkout line longer than 30 sevonds"
1864,WxNlqGSsj_2TCodkx9Sa4A,9/17/2020,5 star rating,Excellent food the sandwiches best to eat hot veggie and spicy roast beef were excellent portion size for the price definitely would order from here again great place just to order lunch from.
1865,WxNlqGSsj_2TCodkx9Sa4A,12/11/2015,4 star rating,"The best part of this place is the quick service and salad tossers. You grab a lettuce bowl and pick your toppings. The guys toss it in a large bowl with dressing so you don't have the awkward  situation where you're tossing your own salad in a tiny bowl and not getting all of the dressing on each of the ingredients. I can't vouch for the hot bar, but I usually stick with salads, mainly because of their lingering 'B' health rating that has yet to be revised after months and months. It's pretty inexpensive and a decent choice for the cafeteria style joints in the area."
1866,WxNlqGSsj_2TCodkx9Sa4A,1/15/2020,3 star rating,I came here a few times for breakfast mostly. The breakfast items are satisfactory and the coffee is good. The items are a little pricey and they have a few seats if you wanna eat in. Overall the place is good if you wanna grab a bite to eat
1867,WxNlqGSsj_2TCodkx9Sa4A,6/1/2018,3 star rating,"An average deli spot where you go around and put a certain amount of food into the cartons and they charge you per pound.I'd have to say that it's pretty damn expensive like any other place. I put like a piece of salmon, a scoop of rice and some plantains and that's already $9.But their food is pretty good, and they have some healthy options so. Average."
1868,WxNlqGSsj_2TCodkx9Sa4A,3/5/2020,1 star rating,"They have really bad customer service, from the the cooks to the cashier. I asked for a whole wheat wrap and they gave me stale bread. When I called for a refund they told me I would I have to come in and return the sandwich. When I arrived they gave me a hard time to return the sandwich.Go next door for better customer service."
1869,WxNlqGSsj_2TCodkx9Sa4A,7/22/2019,4 star rating,"Solid choice if you work within a short walk. Sandwiches are excellent, buffet isn't bad, but everything that isn't a sandwich is really expensive."

1871,WxNlqGSsj_2TCodkx9Sa4A,12/31/2018,4 star rating,Quality deli. Line moves fast even when crowded. Affordable for the area and many good lunch options.
1872,WxNlqGSsj_2TCodkx9Sa4A,7/3/2015,5 star rating,For downtown NYC they have decent prices and great sandwiches here.  I come here when I am in town for work and have never had a bad sandwich here.  I usually get a panini of some sorts and it comes with a drink for less than $8.  Pretty much a bargain in this area.
1873,BYKqlvwqYw9UTQcctMg4Ag,9/26/2019,4 star rating,Usually come here in the mornings. The staff is very caring with the food and they take care of individual tickets one at a time which does make it a little slower but the food is very fresh. They have ordering kiosks which makes it go faster if you can pay by card. Abdul is one of the friendliest staff there and he always remembers me whenever I go in. It is located right by the MTA HQ building.
1874,BYKqlvwqYw9UTQcctMg4Ag,7/7/2019,1 star rating,I'm giving 1 star because the only thing i like was the food was hot. They opened 5 minutes past 11 and had nothing ready. The food is overpriced and no refill on sodas. Only reason we came was because we were in the area..
1875,BYKqlvwqYw9UTQcctMg4Ag,7/9/2019,1 star rating,"Yesterday after our cruise we pop into this BK with my son I never see anything like this! After ordering our food we had to wait 24 minutes before getting served. They called my name twice, I respond and they made me wait and wait and wait again if was awful the staf wasn't helpful at all. My son wasn't feeling well so he was upstairs sitting waiting on me to show up he didn't expect me to get back after 24 minutes. For the manager something is wrong in your organisation so please see what you can do to make your customers get they order faster."
1876,BYKqlvwqYw9UTQcctMg4Ag,10/16/2018,1 star rating,"This location is the closest fast food joint to my office - literally the only reason why I stop by once in a while for a quick burger. However, it tends not to be quick.This location has no system how to manage the service in peak hours. Cashiers take orders and then randomly jump off the registers to wrap the orders and leaving next customers to wait. No dedicated person for wrapping and giving away the orders, no system of the lines or orders tracking. All registers are shared by all cashiers, who obviously don't remember everyones' face and if they have received their orders. Two of my last times they literally forgot to hand me my order, it was just sitting in the kitchen.I have been a restaurant manager before and I see they have more than enough staff, it's just the matter of managing the workflow, and I refuse to believe, the management of this company does not know, how to do this."
1877,BYKqlvwqYw9UTQcctMg4Ag,3/10/2019,4 star rating,"This is the best run Burger King I have been to. Fast service and fresh food. Good job, manager!"
1878,BYKqlvwqYw9UTQcctMg4Ag,4/12/2017,1 star rating,"Renovated but still the same slow service. It seems that unless you go to this establishment every day, you can wait up to half an hour for your food. I went there for breakfast this morning and I saw people come and go while I still waited for my order. Same thing with lunch. Seems that roles in this place are undefined. I would avoid this place."

1884,I-tX4VWJJrrwBQ6E7_wwYw,6/24/2017,3 star rating,"This was one of the most mediocre bars I've ever been to. They had a selection of unremarkable draft beers. The service wasn't the best, but wasn't terrible. I made the mistake of getting the pretzel sticks with cheesy dipping sauce. I'm pretty sure that the pretzel sticks, which were soggy on the bottom and wrinkly on top, came straight out of the freezer. What a waste of $8. The baked potato, for $5, was a much better deal.The front of the bar was pretty crowded, but there was more room in the back, so my party of 6 was able to easily get seats on a Thursday night."
1885,I-tX4VWJJrrwBQ6E7_wwYw,6/10/2016,4 star rating,"Great pub for casual comfort food dinner.  Kid and family friendly. We were walking around looking for a place to have casual comfort food that would make both me and my picky son happy ... and stumbled upon murphys.Walked in and assessed : is this kid / family friendly or just a happy hour drinking bar ... Walking beyond the bar there is ample seating and a cute cozy little area by the kitchen, in the back, with charming painted walls - not pub or bar feeling ... perfect. The server was a sweet enthusiastic and accommodating Irish gal straight from Ireland two weeks before. Any question I asked she took back to the kitchen to ask- which I heard her asking w enthusiasm and sincerity - was very cute. After the many questions we had:- Chili- fabulous Both my picky son and I liked- Mussels, beer dressing - delic. I was apprehensive getting a seafood dish from a pub but the mussels were fresh tasting, plump and the beer dressing was great, sweet- corned beef platter with potatoes  - my very picky son loved it and I tried - very good - shepards pie . Very good. I am a shepards pie snob and am usually more likely to be disappointed than not but theirs did not disappoint.I asked for an after dinner licq and the server asked the bartender - came back with a list of recommendations - so sweet - and gave a sampling ... My son semi passed out at the table from carb overload as I finished the frangelica  ... Happy and full. Thrilled as any mom who sees their picky kid eat incredibly well. My experience here was beyond the pub happy hour and I would definitely recommend having a casual comfort food dinner here - head past the bar area to the back; leave satisfied, full comfort food happy."

I can't comment on the beer or burgers since I didn't try them but other people seem to like those menu items so if I ever go back I'll be sticking to that.."
1887,I-tX4VWJJrrwBQ6E7_wwYw,10/17/2019,3 star rating,"I've been here a few times since a lot of my other favorites in the area (Alley Way and O'Flannagan's) closed. It's a typical Irish pub. Decent beer selection and serves typical bar food.They have specials every night of the week of apps and drinks. Drink specials are decent (Wednesday is $5 wine which is a good deal). The food is okay. I had the sliders and they were pretty bare bones (no cheese, lettuce, onions, etc) as it was just a piece of meat in a bun. Still tasted alright. Boneless wings were a little oddly shaped but decent. I had their tacos at happy hour last year and they were surprisingly good.Not a bad place, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. A good spot to pregame though with their drink specials and some okay food (I would stick to their specials though since the other food seems a little overpriced)."
1888,I-tX4VWJJrrwBQ6E7_wwYw,5/30/2017,3 star rating,I stopped in here for a casual bite to eat with my boyfriend. The bar is pretty close to my apartment so it was perfect. When you walk in it's a typical bar but opens up in the back to a more of a sitting area. I walked in and was told to sit in any seat in the back. The food is pretty standard bar food. we got jalapeño poppers to start along with a beer. The beers are about $6.50/$7. For dinner my boyfriend got a burger and I got the Buffalo chicken wrap. The Buffalo chicken wrap was okay. Someone ordered chili cheese fries and they looked pretty good. I think if I came back I would stick to mostly apps to eat.

I was greeted by a hostess or waitress or just a worker who was there tonight  so not recommend .... Not the first time here they I Ku cook the food to the point that they just see food to the table ....

I LOVE myself some good Mexican food and this spot def scratched that itch. The ambience is loud and trendy but still casual and non-intimidating. Plus the staff is super friendly and attentive. The cocktails were delicious, as was all the food we had. We ordered the queso fundido, tacos de pescado, enchiladas de camarón, and the VVVV good, camarones mazatlán. Loved em all.Go here fam."
1892,dYfJqwaQ0Z-7bPVveG1iQg,6/19/2022,3 star rating,"Quite authentic Mexican restaurant in a convenient location. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but the price is quite high even even though the food is good.The interior of the restaurant was very loud so we were glad to be seated outdoors. Started with the chips and guacamole, which was good but not spectacular. The cocktails took a while to arrive but were unique and tasted very good. The fish tacos are excellent and definitely recommended. The chicken tacos were OK but nothing special. Tacos are around $16 for two and they are not too big.For dessert, our server mentioned chocolate lava cake and it turned out to be a great pick. The texture of the Mexican flan was a bit harder than we were used to and slightly grainy. Service was very attentive throughout, they were great about refilling our drinks and cleaning up used plates."

My friend and I started with the spicy mezcal margaritas with cucumber and basil and loved them so much we had to get another! We split the carne asada tacos and the nachos. The tacos were some of the best I've ever had, but the nachos were lacking a bit in the toppings department. Food was delicious and the service was fast - just wish the nachos came with more on top of them."

They have a great margarita - not on the menu but they were super nice to accommodate our request. The nachos are delicious - it's topped with pickled carrots and peppers and adds the right amount of acidity to the dish. We followed it up with the carne asada tacos - it is loaded with meat, the beef is super tender and tasty. We finished the meal with their tres leches bread pudding which was delicious. Didn't get a lot of tres leches flavor but the bread pudding was soft, moist and the sauce was yummy. Happy to have found this place and I can't wait to come back and try the rest of their menu"
1896,dYfJqwaQ0Z-7bPVveG1iQg,12/2/2022,5 star rating,"New York has never been known for it's Mexican cuisine, especially traditional Mexican. This jernt falls in between somewhere but was very good. We actually shot a TV thing there and food was made especially for the shoot and our crew and actors. Everything was fresh, tasty, and we all enjoyed it very much. The chef knows what he's doing and the restaurant is friendly in decor and nicely laid out."
1897,dYfJqwaQ0Z-7bPVveG1iQg,3/18/2023,5 star rating,Excellent service and amazing food! One of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to in NYC. The guacamole is delicious. They also had virgin mojitos which were super good. My friends and I enjoyed our food - we got the quesadillas and huevos rancheros for brunch. Everything was brought out quickly and we never felt rushed. The staff were so friendly and attentive. Highly recommend this place.
1898,dYfJqwaQ0Z-7bPVveG1iQg,3/24/2023,5 star rating,I have traveled all over Mexico and the cuisine is always a highlight of the trips. Unfortunately when you return to the US you are hard-pressed to find the same quality in a predominantly tex-mex focused culture. So I was delighted to discover La Contenta Oeste's fabulous chef brought a bit of the authentic taste of Mexico to New York City. Every dish from the Guacamole to the incredible deserts were seasoned beautifully with rich and complex flavors. Pricing was very reasonable by New York standards and service was always spot on. The well trained staff didn't miss a beat. I will definitely be a regular and you should be too !

My stomach is too full to make rational decisions that will affect my home for the foreseeable future."

I think a lot of these reviews think this is a legitimate restaurant. It's a glorified school cafe and I'm fine with that. It's cheap, and fun. Everyone enjoys meatballs. Definitely skip out on the broccoli but everything else is pleasant. Have a meal before shopping and it makes the crowds tolerable."
1902,tvqtAjAyc7dplVVwhw3VZQ,9/16/2022,1 star rating,"I was extremely disappointed with the service provided by Ikea Brooklyn and the delivery provided by Lugg, the associate company that provides delivery services. I furnished my apartment with furniture from the store and ordered the delivery, but the floor mirror arrived broken at my place. I called Ikea's customer support department and the attendant told me I'd have to go back to the store in Brooklyn and talk to the customer service in the store (and I live far away from Brooklyn). Even so I went and Ikea attendant, extremely rude, told me that the store had nothing to do and I should contact directly  Lugg.As a result, it's been two weeks since I've been sending e-mails and calling both Ikea and Lugg and getting no positioning. I have already sent pictures of the damaged product and followed all the procedure that was oriented. Ikea's low price does not compensate when the service provided has such a poor quality, and in addition the price of Lugg's delivery is extremely high (about 40 dollars)."

When we come back, i was expecting major changes on food and atmosphere.I was wrong.The ribs are gone. No salad bar.On the menu, they put chicken and vegetarian meatballs.Their dishwasher wasn't working, so we had to eat on paper plates. Not that I don't eat on paper plates, but staff was clueless, what they are going to do. The place was filthy. Soda machines weren't working. There is true management problem here. The dishes we got, they weren't hot, they were warm. I ate it just because i was hungry."

There were no clean utensils, cups, or plates, so customers had to wait a long time to get those. After waiting for these items...we still had to ensure the long line to receive our food. I don't understand how a fully staffed kitchen can take so long to serve meatballs and chicken fingers. Once we got our food, it literally tasted so bad. I couldn't even finish it all. Beware"

Today though was the day that things went south quick for me with Ikea. Usually when i come here i overlook the chaos that comes with great deals. today it was hard to overlook the professionalism and customer care or lack thereof from the staff that works at the Ikea kitchen. the lines were absurd and the people were eating frantically and that is sure great for business, however they were poorly prepared to receive this amount of patrons in their restaurant as their items started to run out and that was very frustrating as we spent a good amount of time lined up to only get ton our turn and have what we wanted run out. the worst part was to see the almost joy in the face of the staff when they would tell the customers that they ran out of something without even trying to make sure that there was not any more of the items in the back. the staff of Ikea today changed the way i looked at the Ikea experience as a whole. i am really disappointed at this experience."

It is practically a zoo here. 2- Be prepared to see trays and dirty plates stacked. It is apparent that people do not put trays, plates, silverware away. It was filthy last weekend when I was here. Did not bother with the lines. Just walked out to use the rest rooms which was gross and unkempt. Do not know if staff regularly clean the bathrooms. Been to many other IKEA's and this one is plane gross.3- Is it me or the quality of the coffee has changed. The acidity is so high that my teeth hurts after sipping some hot coffee.4- First time came here was because it was my first visit. Second time was to bring a family member who never been to IKEA in NYC.I will stick with the other IKEA's. Forget this one."

Going to the line with less people had no dessert options available to take. Grabbed the more popular Swedish meatball with mashed potatoes gravy and green beans. Washed it all down with sparking pear drink.The meatballs were meh, weird after taste an hour later. Were warm. Gravy was good on both the meatballs and mashed potatoes. Although the green beans had a nice crunch, they were cold. I never add salt to food but the green beans needed it.I don't get what they hype is about with the meatballs. I nearby restaurant was slammed and I couldn't shop on an empty stomach so this was needed. For, 7.88 it is outrageous. $5 max. A halal cart offers more and better quality food in my opinion."

I used to like this place especially their best seller rolls, sushi and sashimi boat and lollipop chicken. Decided to order few things to go since I haven't gone back since COVID. I ordered the Katsu platter, best seller rolls, and stuffed octopus. The only thing that was good was the Katsu platter. I would definitely not order sushi and stuffed octopus again. Sushi rice was hard and bland. Honestly, all the rolls tasted the same and not the freshest . The stuffed octopus was burnt and hard; can't believe they actually serves it to their customers..."
1911,elYM_Q52kprd1DYN3ty3rA,7/14/2021,4 star rating,This is still the all time fav spot I always order take out from. They have raised the price a little but I still think it's worth it. I love the four combo sushi rolls for $13 and the salmon bento rice box $8. All their fried rices and fried noodles are only around 7$. Totally worth it since it's still on the cheaper end and the quality is still so good and fresh! Wonder if they will ever open back up their in door dining? We really missed it!

My family used to come here twice a week and now every time we come, IF we do, it's a gamble. Literally spent an extra $5 to make SURE we got an extra piece of scallop in our order but we didn't get ANY, PLUS they forgot the pieces that were supposed to come in the order itself. What exactly am I paying for? The amount of times I've dealt with stinky fish, missing dishes from my order, and overall less than mediocre food is sad"

I was craving sushi and I have seen how broad their menu is (Chinese dishes, Japanese dishes -sushi and even ramen-).Ordered their 4 rolls deal with the spicy scallop roll and fried shrimp roll for $12.95 (which is great because the spicy scallop roll was $6.95 by itself) and their curry potato croquette bento box $6.95 (comes with two pieces, a california roll, fried chicken pieces, rice, miso soup).Everything was delicious and I would definitely be coming back. They do not have indoor nor outdoor seating, only delivery and take-out. I was surprised how busy this place was and it was past lunch time. Good for them because their prices are great and the food was amazing!"

The place was busy but not terribly so. started with a glass of sangria which was delicious!  Nice and strong just the way I like it, much better than most places where I've had sangria.We started with an appetizer of Camarones Al Ajillo, shrimp in a butter and garlic sauce with a side of bread.  The first thing I noticed is how long it took to get the appetizer - we waited a good twenty minutes or so for it to come out. The shrimp didn't have any taste, but the sauce was good.  For entrees I had the Churrasco, my mother ordered the Ropa Vieja and I order chicken fingers and fries for my granddaughter.  I have to say I was so disappointed in the food......The chicken fingers and fries were fried so hard the chicken was dry - it was way overcooked (see picture below).  The churrasco,  although cooked to a perfect medium, again had NO taste, no seasoning, no nothing.  The sauce it came with helped it out a little but not by much.  It came with white red, black beans and plantains - they were ok.  My mother said her Rope Vieja was ok but she's had better.Although lunch was priced right, the meal itself was disappointing."

We had the appetizer platter (very good), ropa vieja (my wife's is much better), and a Cuban sandwich (nothing like the one from Versailles in Miami). They had a Monday night drink special running (great value). Our bill came to about $75 plus tip. It is dog friendly as you can sit outside with your pups). I have also been to the one on the water (Blend on the Water). I recommend trying the rocket shrimp at that location. We ordered 3 plates. It was that good. Overall, a nice haunt."

Service was friendly, attentive, and quick."

It's a pretty bright place with neon lights and fake palm trees. Overall the place is quite reasonably priced and the portion size is decent. I I got the Pennil which was a slow roasted pork in a very nice pepper based sauce. Awesome plantains as well. The drink selection was good with some nice craft cocktails and $27 sangria pitchers (highly recommend!). Not much for a beer selection but the cocktails and inexpensive wine bottles and sangria pitchers make up for it. Service was good and nice and quick. Overall I wouldn't say it's a must try but definitely a solid all around restaurant."

Luckily this spot was not only open, but had heated outdoor seating as well.Decided on the Guacamole and Chips ($8) to start. Moderate bowl of chunky guac with a handful of thick-cut tortilla chips. Could have been spicier yet the avocados tasted fresh. For the main course, ordered the Pernil ($15) - a combination of roast pork, sweet plantains, rice, beans, and a side salsa. Absolutely amazingly cooked meat - melt in the mouth and needing no extra sauce. Sweet plantains are also flavorful, not overly cooked and gave a balance to the dish. Beans and rice are nominal.Service did take some time as we were one of the only people outside, though very accommodating. Would like to try their brunch as well."

I shared this with my date and we were full by the end of it. I do wish the meat was a bit more tender, but it wasn't dry by any means. Rice + beans were great and sweet plantains were amazing!Mofongo- I really enjoyed this! It is a huge portion and the sauce around it is more tomato-y. I would recommend adding meat to it!Overall, it was a great experience. Their happy hour drinks are cheap and delish, and the service was so quick and lovely!"

Our waitress was nice but not very efficient or communicative given that we waited over an hour for the food. This location is smaller than all of the other ones I've been to so it does tend to get packed faster. Make a reservation on weekends ahead of time if you're a larger party. I stopped by for dinner during my most recent visit. We started with the guac and chips and a a round of drinks. The coconut mojito is my favorite! For my entree I had the pernil which comes with yellow rice, beans and tostones. It also comes with a garlic based sauce on the side that was delicious. My mom got the lomo saltado; a little salty for my liking but she enjoyed it. The churrasco is a solid choice as well. All of the dishes I've had have been really good and are well priced for the amount you get. We were so full we had no room for dessert. Great restaurant for birthday or even a casual dinner. If you like Blend on the Water but prefer a low key vibe check out this location! Their brunch is also *chefs kiss.*"

I am accustomed to the taste and what happens when I put half & half in the coffee - it turns a lighter color. I walked into this Starbucks for the 10th time this month, ordered a dark roast and paid. When I put the half & half in, the coffee turned a dull dark brown color, it was quite unusual. I didn't want to be difficult so I tasted it to make sure the taste was as off as the color, it was. I brought it to the attention of the Barista and not only did she give an attitude , she took a quick glance at the coffee and says, "" so what do you want?"" I reply, I'm sorry, but I'm sure you can tell something is off about this coffee. I had this exact coffee yesterday and many times this month - this color is not ordinary and the taste is off."" Again her response, ""oh do you want a pour over or something?"" Look, I didn't want anything special. I just wanted to enjoy the same cup of coffee I have been enjoying every day this month.

Then I saw the girl using milk to make my drink when I specifically asked for soy. Apparently the other girl at the cash register didn't write ""S"" on my drink to indicate soy. So she rolled her eyes and mumbled something. Rude. HELLOO...can you pay attention to what you're doing please?It's not like I'm drinking soy because I like the taste. I'm drinking it because i'm lactose-intolerant! So could you please not try to kill me or any other customer next time?

Based on the reviews below, I'm surprised management hasn't done something about their employees and poor work ethic. The staff is extremely rude and not only that, they fail to communicate with one another. I asked for a java chip frappe with soy, no whip. Then I saw the girl using milk to make my drink when I specifically asked for soy. Apparently the other girl at the cash register didn't write ""S"" on my drink to indicate soy. So she rolled her eyes and mumbled something. Rude. HELLOO...can you pay attention to what you're doing please?It's not like I'm drinking soy because I like the taste. I'm drinking it because i'm lactose-intolerant! So could you please not try to kill me or any other customer next time? Additionally, they blatantly complain about working ""10 hour shifts"" which is extremely unprofessional. Get your acts together people! Avoid this place at all costs!"

Restaurant said they knew nothing and it only takes them 5mins to make lo mein, chicken wings and egg rolls. Very sketchy ! Might i add restaurant is over 20mins from my house so it's very unlikely after placing an order it's been cooked annnnnd delivered in 15mins. Do not order from here !!!"

1973,301PydNifTta-G3YvnK4ZA,11/13/2016,1 star rating,"So I use to order from this place ALL if the time. The food was pretty good. I always ordered the same thing. They would even bring the food all the way upstairs. I only live on the 2nd floor. Flaws: I ordered one time and the food was spoiled. I had to throw it all away. I requested for them to make it fresh going forward after that and I did. I won't he ordering from here again because the last time I attempted to order was a shit show. As always, I requested for them to bring the food upstairs as my mom can not walk the greatest and would not be able to go downstairs and get the food. This was never an issue in the past. I've ordered over 10 times and they came up 8 out of 10 of those times. The times they didn't was because they couldn't find parking. This last time they called me and said they don't come up. So I said they always do for my mom and he told me they don't come up in the projects. 1. I don't live in the projects. I live in a 23 story building off of the river with security. 2. Discrimination much? I continued to explain my mom's situation and that they always bring the food up for her. He says you can cancel the order because they're not coming up. I said whatever I'll figure it out for my mom. My mom calls me and asks where I food is. So I called them. This fuck bag tells me grubhub called him and said I wanted to cancel the order which was a TOTAL lie. When I called grubhub she said that is false and cancelled the order. So I will NEVER be ordering from here again. Crazy, you come in communities of color to make your money and have the nerve to be biased about where you deliver. Unfucking real!"

The food is on the side of bland to overcooked. Take a pass on this place. You would enjoy a bag of chips with a juice more. If I could give no stars that would be more accurate.

Very simplistic. Not too much variety of sauces but simple and to the point. Drenched in sauce as requested. The cashier is friendly. The place is cash only so I had to make a run to the bank to get my bread but all in all, the wings are excellent. Fries are nothing special. I prefer their organic small wings over buffalo wild wings big strong steroid muscle 100lb curling chicken wings tbh. Been eating here for over 9 years."

1984,_WD-5-QpxTpOkRIBfrspdA,12/1/2019,3 star rating,These are quite arguably the best wings in town. They are crispy and taste like real chicken. There are also various flavors to pick from. Things that bother me include the cash only policy that has resulted in me going to the Chinese store next door for cash. The customer service which can be cold in person. It is like you are better off calling in your order as the phone get preference over anyone in person. Finally while the wings come with carrots a Anne celery it is not uncommon for the carrots to be dry as though they were cut the previous week in bulk and have just been sitting in the fridge... great taste but so much could be better.

Whenever I eat the wings, I know I'll be sweating by the time I'm finished because of the heat from the sauce. They need to get AC, though. It can get too hot during the summer. They can afford an AC unit. Nice place, though."

I  love the Spanish guy at the register. He is the sweetest and so patient. The honey BBQ wings and buffalo ones are good! Definitely one of the best places to get wings from in Brooklyn! I had wings catered for my 23rd bday party which was 8 years ago and they still never fell off! And the main thing I iike about this place is that the wings are not jumbo as if they're injected with something lol! I  wish this place of business more success to come

1988,_WD-5-QpxTpOkRIBfrspdA,10/9/2019,5 star rating,"Hands down, the wings here are AMAZing. The price is worth it and tastes much better than Buffalo Wild Wings or other wing spots.  Been here about 3 times and I try diff sauces. Favorites are honey bbq and honey mustard (not sure if that is the actual names there). You get a bargain for 10 wings, side and celery for under 11! Keep in mind, CASH ONLY! so be prepared or there is an atm nearby. My new go-to spot."

They have a great happy hour 5-8 mon-fri with 4 dollar olives and bar nuts and 7 dollar glasses of wine. And on Wednesday its half off wine bottles.I came here in 2018 and this year for the same thing- Halloween wine and chocolate tasting.Last year we tasted 5 wines and this year we only tasted 4. Also this year they gave one less brownie, not a full second chocolate bar and not a fifth piece of chocolate since there was no fifth wine. And all for the same 45 dollar price. I was disappointed at that. Also disspointed because last year they made that back room stunning with dim light and candle light on each table to really set a nice halloween mood. This year there was bright light and no halloween mood/decorations. Also none of the wines wowed me and if I wanted to buy one it would run me 35 - 45 dollars which is quite expensive for wine when I can pick up an excelllent European wine for 20 dollars. But I went again this year b.c I love chocolate and I thought it was a great halloween event. Upset this year it was not on par.But don't get me wrong this place is a great bar. Amazing food and a cozy hangout spot. Last year before the wine tasting we ate dinner here and got the baked brie and lamb sliders (which are not on the menu anymore). The baked brie was delicious I wish they still had that on the menu. This year we got turkey meatballs and the beet and white bean humus. Both were excellent. The humus was large and tastey and came with huge slices of bread, carrots and cucumbers for 9 dollars. For 10 dollars they gave us 11 small turkey meatballs bursting with rosemary flavor. Both dishes priced well. I find the sliders on the menu to be expensive at 17 dollars for two sliders. Despite me being disspointed at the chocolate and wine tasting this year, this is a great happy hour spot where you will not be dissapointed in the food!"

It's very small so the tour is quick but the experience of drinking all of the wine and discussing it was very memorable. I would say the wine did give me a huge headache though which is why I took away 1 star but it could be because of the sulfites (granted, most wine gives me a headache for this reason but for some reason my headache was especially bad here). Overall I loved all of the wines I tried here taste-wise & thought the experience was very memorable."

Many different brews and wines were available. Flavors ranging from dry to sweet wines, along with dark ales and light lagers. I personally Enjoyed a red Cabernet with a hint of oak. Cocktail hour was great. The lobster salad was out of this world. Fantastic seafood bar. Nice set up and presentation/decor.Enjoyed the hanger steak during the entree. Medium rare tender slices of well prepared steak. I would love to come back during regular hours to see how the operation runs when they are not doing private parties. Very nice experience. Definitely recommend going to this winery."
1997,yYT-Eo7LChczZs7YE_BL2w,11/19/2017,4 star rating,"This review is for a wine tasting that I attended with my girlies, Darlene P. and Melissa M. We bought tickets for $25 each, the week prior and arrived a few minutes early. They allowed us to wait in the main dining area until the event started. Once they were ready, they checked us in fairly quickly, handed us wine glasses and sent us on our merry way to explore! I was very happy that we got there early because the place got packed real quick.I sampled the white wines, rosés and champagnes first and then the reds. By the time I was ready for the darker vino variety, we were all elbow to elbow. They featured local wines from Long Island, NYC and Westchester which I appreciate, greatly; really good wines, locally sourced. The representatives were very knowledgeable and I took pics of the wines I would like to try again.They also had light spread for us to nosh on, such as cheese, crackers, fruit, seasoned nuts, pickles, crudités, charcutarie and sweets. There was definitely enough to hold me over while I sipped. The staff was attentive and kept the chilled water carafes full and I just loved the chic rustic decor of the space. I've read that people have had wedding receptions here and I can't totally see it. I swear I stepped into a Pinterest post with all of the reclaimed wood and string lights. I would definitely come back and my only regret is not arriving at least an hour earlier so that we could have sampled some of their) Brooklyn Winery's regular food menu items.We were all gifted with informational pamphlets describing what we sampled as well as a reusable tote after the event. The location was perfect, only 30 minutes from my home but traffic was a little hectic. Despite that, we found parking nearby so the night was a success."

Usually weddings equal mediocre food, unenthusiastic staff and getting really drunk because of the aforementioned things and boredom- not here. The food was amazing, and actually I'm only leaving a review today because I came to Yelp to see if some of what we ate is on their regular menu ( it is.) Have you ever done that after a wedding? The staff was fantastic- particularly Douglas, whom should run for president, or at least mayor of NYC because we need his energy right about now. Our cups were always full, be it wine, water or coffee- they even offered additional portions of the proteins during dinner (which I took them up on the fried chicken because it was amazing.) The place is super clean and we felt very safe COVID-wise.Their wines were delicious, although limited in varietals, most everyone will enjoy what they do have. There is also liquor if that's more your speed.Would highly recommend this place if you're considering an event or a night out.PS eat the brussel sprouts. They are ridiculous."

We mostly begged for attention to have our b'day friend's name called out but they were too busy attending their own friends. Very disrespectful for a tiny & uncomfortable place. Bad place!"

I have spoken to them in both Spanish and English and they don't pay attention. Ordering food here to go can easily take 10 min.  I have a serious problem with business who don't appreciate faithful patronage.  My family has ordered delivery from here consistently for over a year, I began coming by for pick up and I can't believe how lacking they are in courtesy and overall friendliness. I don't want to deal with it anymore. They have decent food, a great location and a nice, clean looking restaurant. However, none of that keeps customers, if the staff isn't respectful or attentive. They aren't. We're ordering from another Spanish spot now. Even though we've always been friendly when I've come by or my family has, the ladies behind the counter consistently have bad attitudes. We order food about four times a week. That money is going to another restaurant now."

They serve your typical Dominican/Latin lunch and dinner food, but they prepare it very well and good quality. I've never actually dined in, I always pick up some dinner or order delivery when I don't feel like cooking the same type of food myself lol (since I am Dominican); so I can't speak for dine in experience. They also cater which came in handy for a baby shower I was hosting. Everyone raved about the food, especially the pernil. My aunt is like the queen of pernil and even she enjoyed it, so I think that says a lot. I don't particularly like there potato salad, a bit flavorless and the potatoes and carrots are cut up in bigger chunks then i prefer. This isn't a place i would go completely out of my way to try out, but its a great spot to have in the neighborhood for the home cooked Dominican meals when you don't actually want to cook :)"

Came here to get a lunch special, I ordered the goat with white rice and beans. First the rude Dominican lady that works there that used to work in flor del paraiso takes the beans and pours it all over my rice. My plate began to look like soup. I tell her put the meat separately. BecAuse I do not want more juice on my rice. She tells me no problem. What she should of did was put my beans in a cup or something. Not all over my rice, but that's besides the point. I go to pay and they charge me $18. Meanwhile the lunch special was $8.50. She tells me because she separated it that's why it's that much. What kind of nonsense is that ? I had to seperate it because of the mess she made with the beans. Guess what. I paid $8.50 after arguing with her for 5 min. I had to talk to the manager. Never again will I come here. They only gave me like 5 pieces of goat anyway.  Over this place."

Helps warm you up real good!Tomato, egg and beef - my favorite by far; so silly, saucy and filled with flavors! A huge portion for lunch and only for 9 bucks?!?! Definitely worth it and will come back for more very soon! Double cooked pork - fatty and saucy, just the way you want it to be. A great balance between veggies and pork, paired perfectly with rice. Definitely try this! Xiaolong bao - Shanghai dumplings are delicious and filled with soup in every single piece. Very comforting and you can definitely throw down a few if not the whole plate!Spicy and sweet wonton - very interesting combo of sweetness and spiciness with a hint of peanut sauce to tie it all up neatly. A nice twist to your typical spicy wonton!This was an overall delicious meal and the service was definitely A+.

The nice man who dropped off my food wished me a good night after drop off. Opened my bag and food was still warm. Got all the salsa and lime i asked for. Food was delicious. Favorite was the bistec tacos but I'm probably biased because I'm a big ""asada"" fan. The al pastor was my second favorite and the Barbacoa wasn't really my thing but that was my first time trying barbacoa. Maybe it's an acquired taste for goat meat. My side of guacamole was delicious and I plopped some it on top of my tacos. So good! I see why they charge extra for extra green salsa. It's so tasty and just the right amount of mildly hot. I poured it on everything. The red sauce is more smoky than hot but still good. Would definitely re order and eat in from here. It's a nice place for tacos for sure! I'll have to try a torta next time."

The tacos weren't anything special and to be quite frank could've saved my $6. Last time I was here, I mentioned the lack of salt on the pork and again no seasoning. The addition of cheese, crema, lettuce tomatoes and hot sauce (which I added myself), masks the fact that the pork has no seasoning on it. However, seasoning isn't my complaint today. It's the blobs and blobs of pork fat and barely any meat (I counted two pieces in each taco) that's my issue with my tacos today. Again, last time I said there were bits and bits of pork fat. Today, guess the cook decided to just give me all pork fat. Needless to say, I had a ""vegetarian"" taco because I dumped out all pork fat. If I'm in the area, I will not return for any tacos. I'll return to redeem my check in offer. But at this point it doesn't even matter."

I then sat there for 10 mins and waited for for my check that never came but I can clearly see you in my line on vision at the register on your phone. I see you see me sitting here waiting.

Also, that's an ugly shirt you're wearing.As an added bonus, Taqueria el Fogon is a wonderfully friendly place. Por ejemplo:As I was uncontrollably stuffing my face, some guy walked in, clapped his hand on my shoulder, and yelled something unintelligible at me in Spanish. Then he looked down, realized I wasn't who he thought I was and laughed long and heartily at his mistake. This man is now going to be the best man at my wedding.That last sentence wasn't true.

I would've told my waitress but  they never came by, and I really wanted a drink. So after 30 mins of waiting (even though there was only 1 other table of 4 at the time I sat down), i flagged down another one. They apologized for the poor service but this continued to be a problem throughout the night."

Would give zero stars if I would got there at 10pm with my group of 5 first it took 35 mins to get seat on the hostess came told us the last seats are  the seats were all way in the corner in the balcony and just dipped didn't even lead us to our table but lead everyone else. There were people who check in later and got seated earlier with better seats and got leaded to there tables.Paying $25 per a person to reserve a table for that kind of service is not worth it.

2057,YzyHW3w0HUyaG8EvplNT1A,5/22/2022,5 star rating,"In my experience, restaurant reviews are unreliable.  People are more likely to post a complaint than a compliment.  Stuff happens.On my first visit, I was treated well by all staff.  Had a nice conversation with one of them.  It was quite clear that they had adequate and competent staff.For popular shows, like the one I attended, the table seating is very compact.  It's Manhattan.  If you don't like being in a tight crowd, move to, or stay in,  Oklahoma.Food is fine and well-priced.  Drinks are bar-priced.  No one is forcing you to drink alcohol.The website makes it quite clear that table seating has a $20-$25 minimum order requirement.  Honestly, if you think you can go to a supper club in Manhattan for $20 something, with no extras, you are delusional.  And we don't want you here.Oh, and things don't always start on time.  Again, don't come to this city if you want everything to start at the precise ticketed time.  No one who lives here expects that, yet somehow they deal with it.GREAT venue.  Very fun!"

But on the other hand the waitress Madeleine was very disrespectful, rude and slow. At the end of the night my bill came up to 96.90. I paid my bill with a credit card and left a cash tip. Madeleine stole 20.00 extra dollars from  my credit card. Instead of paying 96.90 I was charged 116.90. I've called this establishment twice and spoke to Susan, who said the problem would be fixed and still it has not been rectified. She should lose her job, because how many other people have she done this to that missed it. Check your accounts if you go to this establishment and keep your receipts"

I hadn't heard of this french bistro but when I walked in I was instantly impressed by the space. The ceiling itself has a hand painted mural and the bar area is very appropriate for the neighborhood. When it came time to order i decided to get the namesake burger with a side of their house fries. A solid burger with no complaints! The service here was amazing and the vibes as the night continued here was also great. I'd recommend coming here for dinner with a small group for a guaranteed great evening.
2060,rkPpLoJKMUTNmd-uyqfq1g,10/17/2021,4 star rating,First time visiting this restaurant after passing by it several times. It's always packed day and night. I happened to come here during brunch. I got the mussels in garlic and cream (moules marinieres) and it was OK at best. There wasn't much of a cream aspect. The spicy lamb burger on the other hand was fantastic! I switched out the goat cheese with gruyere and so glad I did. I would definitely get this again. This is definitely a place for burgers no so much French dishes.

They Really flourished in the pandemic by mastering the Art of turning outside area into a cute comfy comfortable and desirable set up. The menu isn't huge and doesn't change a lot and I'm sure over the past few years I've had everything on that menu but I've never had a bad meal there. And I really love their drinks. It's also nice that because of their extra seating outside (with heaters) you can almost always get a table.

The eating utensils were dirty we had to ask for new ones. Famous lamb burger was just OK. Their Choice of a burger bun is bad. When the buns toasted it's very dry and hard as a rock. The vegetables for the burger was very OLD and tasted like the refrigerator..The Crab cake was the best thing about that place, it's also OVERPRICED and it just one CRAB CAKE. Don't recommend"

I started my meal with the Caesar salad. I was taken back by the sardines, however, it was an amazing combination with the salad (I recommend). I was in the mood for some mussels and that is what I got with the garlic spinach and fries. My overall in-person experience was great. I also left with a Togo order of the steak frites and oven roasted chicken for my friends. They did enjoy their food, however their one critic was the lack of flavor. Which is why I gave four stars."

We were seated immediately, there doesn't seem to be too much of a rush. The place is really big, with one side for the bar on the other side for the restaurant. Plus the space is really cool very well laid out lots of cool colors I love the artwork on the wall which is like impressionist African-American portraits. The wait stuff was really helpful and accommodating and recommended the Stay in lime for me cocktails as well as the go overboard. They were delicious and really different. The stay in lime was smoky with mezcal and the go overboard was a bourbon cocktail but tasted very different because of the lime and ginger in it. For food, We tried the mussels which were not that great, but the truffle fries were outstanding. we also tried the grilled octopus, which was truly outstanding and I will definitely recommend this and will get it every time I go. We tried a special for the night which was a mushroom risotto with grilled shrimp and that was really well-made and the risotto itself was delicious. We got the cheese platter but I don't really recommend us. And for dessert we tried the flourless chocolate cake which was very decadent and something I'll always get but to be clear it's really rich. We tried the key lime pie as well it's a good pie, it's just not something that I would personally get again. I'll be back again for sure."

We ordered 2 breakfast sandwiches, one with and one without cheese (my wife cannot eat dairy). For starters, we sat at the table for over 15 minutes until we got a buzz signal (and the restaurant was not busy at all). When I went to pick up the sandwiches, I saw that both had cheese. I tried to tell the kitchen staff that the order was wrong. They pointedly ignored me for 5 minutes (chatting with each other, relaxing, and not cooking anything, since there were no customers). Then one of them said rudely that she doesn't know what I'm talking about. I walked away and returned with my wife who explained dairy would make her sick. At that point one of the staff said they'd re-do her sandwich, accordimg to their order, which they did in about 5 minutes.I think paying $5 for a piece of bread with scambled eggs and really bad, rude service is not an experience I'll ever want to repeat.Even before pandemic we had multiple incidents with this particular Panera location - the food was clearly not fresh, smelled terrible, and had to be returned."

She took her time to explain the combos to my mom and what certain items contained. My mom ordered half steak & argula sandwich with a small lobster Mac & cheese. I ordered a full bacon turkey bravo sandwich.Once we got home we decided to dig in. My mom couldn't stop raving about her sandwich. She liked her Mac and cheese sans the lobster claw. It was extremely fishy and salty. We were both under the impression that the Mac and cheese would have  sliced up lobster pieces mixed in, however we were sadly mistaken. She also stated that the Mac and cheese was a little too cheesy for which says a lot because she loves cheese. My bacon turkey bravo sandwich was on the bland side. I couldn't enjoy it because it was dry and lacked condiments. I tried jazzing it up but I ended up tossing it."

Even with plentiful seating, there doesn't seem to be enough. A socially anxious person like myself would see an empty seat as if it were a refuge. It's not their fault.However, what is their fault is the lack of commitment to cleanliness. Also, picking up an order can be a pain in the ass. You hear your order somewhere in the loudness, you go over to pick it up, and food that may or may not be yours just sits there for a moment as you wait for one employee to be available for just one second to confirm that this is indeed your order. A lack of communication is always an F in my book.The food has been mostly above average; the quality is there. The cheddar broccoli soup is to die for (4 / 5) and the sandwiches here and there have been delicious. However, my most recent order was a steak sandwich which was underwhelming. For a $10 sandwich, there wasn't enough steak, and the little steak that was in it was dripping a little too much blood.Still, not bad. Will I return? Occasionally, as usual."

There probably two dozen tables here so plenty of seating. They have larger tables as well for groups bigger than four people.You place your order at the counter and then the pick up window is to the left of the counter.

Although it was empty when we were seated, we realized it's because there was a ton of takeout being prepared and delivered. The service was great, and I ordered the Volcano Roll as well as the Shrimp Tempura Roll. I absolutely LOVED the rice ratio, because it helped bind the sushi without being too much. The fish and flavors were also very very delicious. The shrimp tempura was amazing, and for some reason my friends and I thought the avocado in the rolls were some of the best we ever had. Overall, I highly recommend this place for sushi!"

It contained lots of fish, mainly tuna and salmon.  Except for one piece, it seemed fresh, but it was served colder than it should have been.  This huge plate of fish was $17.  The lunch also came with miso soup, which was not very tasty.  I also ordered a large hot sake, which was good.The restaurant itself, with high ceilings, was like a barn and freezing, almost as cold as outdoors. This was despite a heater 3 feet away from me.  It is kind of hard to enjoy your meal when you are so cold.  The service was fine, and the servers were friendly.  I arrived at 2:45, and they stop serving lunch at 3:30.  The thing that really turned me off was that, shortly before 3:30 I wanted to order another sake, and they refused to serve it, saying the kitchen was closed (Side note: sake doesn't come from the kitchen) .  I wanted to chill for a few more minutes but, when I asked if I had to leave at 3:30 I was told:  Yes.It is totally ridiculous that I couldn't just sit there for a few more minutes.  Some Japanese restaurants are notorious for just throwing you out when they want to stop serving.  I can understand this late at night when they want to go home, but at 3:30 in the afternoon, they had to be there anyway, and they had given me the check before I even asked for it  (They are definitely efficient.)  This totally turned me off, and I won't return.  There are many sushi restaurants in NYC, but not many that are both reasonable and enjoyable."

Popularity based upon thin options, no competitor within many a mighty stone throw. One employee performing every duty speaks of cheapness, (prep, cook, buss, register) the dice of the steak for my quesadilla spoke of cheapness. Its possible that a mincing is traditional for the cut, to me it was a way to cover for quality and  sell smaller portions. A 6"" quesadilla is minuscule and way over priced at six dollars.More of a bottom line business approach where the food plays second fiddle to the bottom line."

First off, this place is run by VERY RUDE PEOPLE!!!! I can tell they do not like their jobs by their body language and actions. The energy that they project towards me and my friends is very unsettling. Secondly, when I order food from an establishment, customer service is always a big part of the experience for me. I believe that customer service plays a huge role in creating a returning customer. Today, September 25th, I ordered a Chicken Quesadilla and a Shrimp Taco. When I was paying, the lady that served me acted as if she was in a rush to get me out of the building. As I got my food, I looked into my bag and realized there was only 2 very small containers of salsa (Approximately 1 oz in each).I kindly asked for a second one because I there is no way I can eat a quesadilla and taco with just 2 oz of salsa. The lady behind the counter immediately got upset with me demanding that I pay 50 CENTS for another ounce of sauce. I have been to this place many times and never experienced such a rude interaction here. I wasn't mad at the fact that I didn't get sauce, I was upset with how angry she was getting with me over a small salsa cup from a valued returning customer.After what I experienced today, Taco King on Union Turnpike will NEVER get another dollar out of me!!!!!! I would never recommend this food spot to anybody!!!! NEVER EVER EVER EVER BUY FROM THIS PLACE!!!"

The sushi is the best you'll get from a takeout spot in all over NYC (specially their spicy combo and yankee/met rolls) and their chicken teriyaki dinner boxes + chicken katsu curry are *chefs kiss.* Its a small business and they are very hardworking, so definitely go and support!"

2108,7j6CGUCw93gEsYqSetCstw,9/6/2020,5 star rating,Ordered luncheon from this restaurant during pandemic. Delivery was incredibly fast. Within 30 minutes (despite my home is over 2 miles from it) Food was fresh. My MIL loves the sashimi tray I ordered for her. We love the salmon teriyaki and chicken katsu lunchboxes which come with salad and steamed shumai(dumplings). I would definitely order from it again whenever I don't want to cook lol
2109,FC0F7sp7vPMpKxMDTqQcaQ,12/14/2019,5 star rating,Cute spot in Williamsburg for wine. I also enjoy their grilled cheese and tomato soup! Perfect spot in the summer because there are seats outside. Indoors is always warm and welcoming.

The mignonette was decent, but I prefer more horseradish with my cocktail sauce.While I would love to give this place 5 stars just because of the well priced crustacean, I docked a star because the place was more shabby than shabby chic.Still, I would come back and recommend it."

It's basically one small room with a cute tiled floor, a small bar, and dim lighting. Really nice for some one-on-one time with a friend or partner. They have a chessboard you can use, which is fun, but I also like to bring cards with me. It's been pretty empty every time I've been there, which I love, but I've never gone on a weekend night so I'm not sure if it ever gets really busy.Food: The food is minimal. Think of it more like snacks than an actual meal. Drinks: The drinks are pretty self-explanatory, mostly wine. They have a nice mulled wine for around $8 which is great for the colder weather."

I read someone mention below it's a little more shabby than shabby chic.... I wouldn't go that far, but it's definitely a low key neighborhood spot. Is the service sometimes mediocre? Sure. Just sit down, enjoy who you're with, and don't stress it. This is the kind of place where you feel like you want to be a regular. It has its own charm you can't eexactly put your finger on. We love coming on Friday's after work for oysters and sitting at the bar. If you  live in the neighborhood, definitely check it out."

It's a cute and cozy little wine bar with outdoor patio seating available. They have good wines at $20 a bottle which the beau and I shared, plus they have $1 oysters (east and west coast available). So we had a half dozen oysters plus some raw clams which the beau insisted I try. Everything was top notch and we truly enjoyed our lovely romantic date night here.The only thing that annoyed me was the bartender who spilled our wine, not once but TWICE. And didn't even offer to replace it even though we paid for the whole bottle. Other than that, if I lived in NY, you'd probably find me here often!"
2116,FC0F7sp7vPMpKxMDTqQcaQ,7/29/2018,4 star rating,"All I have to say is...$1.00 oysters!!! We came here on a Sunday evening and enjoyed about 2 dozen oysters and ceviche with a bottle of riesling- all of this for under $100! It was a romantic little spot but also had a very casual atmosphere- there are menus at the table but you need to go up to the bar to order both food and drinks. The server only comes to the table to deliver your order. We actually really enjoyed this process as there were no interruptions during our meal and we felt that we had alot of privacy.I would have rated Pinkerton 5 stars but they lost a star because of the interior decor. Although the booth seating looked cozy at first, we quickly realized that the leather seats were ripped to the point where the springs were visible and not comfortable to sit on, at all. Once we moved our seats, we enjoyed the rest of our evening but I just can't understand why they wouldn't put in the effort to repair the ripped seats."

They are widely known for their Oysters, sells out quickly too; And yes they are addictive especially when paired with a bottle of Wine!"

We waited 5-10 mins for him to at least welcome us but that didn't seem like it was going to happen so we just walked out. Pretty disappointing because we were looking forward to dollar oysters but I can only imagine how slow the service will be to get food considering we received no service to get a table."

It's was 6 o'clock in the evening and they said they ran out of pernil. And they bought out a chicken soup without chicken.  They didn't say anything until questioned and then decided to tell the customer that  they were out of chicken as well.  Yet they served the soup that way.  The taste of the food that they did have wasn't bad, which is why they got the two stars.  But we asked for three dishes before we were actually able to get a dish."

The place overall is clean . The music is great as well. But the food is the main deal it is very dry the rice is dry and the baked chicken is ridiculously dry I asked the lady for sauce for the baked chicken and the lady in her words exactly said "" sorry everything is dry there is no sauce "" I was shocked when she said that I mean to say it with such confidence that the food is dry I mean how it's just ridiculous.  I wish they would work on it"

I won't order from here again because the delivery driver didn't want to come in my apartment building, he had the owner call and tell me to come outside like his life was in danger.  lol that's funny!  I live in an high end apartment building in Silver Lake your safer in there, then you are where this restaurant is located. Next time ... I'll order from the many other Spanish restaurants in this location that have better food and would be happy to deliver to me. Ciao Campo Bello!"

They carry on their own conversations while there is a line of customers waiting to place their orders. Delivery takes at least an hour and the delivery man has a nasty attitude as well.

Don't expect much from the store front or costumer service, but the food is delicious! Can't get enough of their spicy oil sauce. Recently when we came here they only wontons available. Maybe it was because it was almost closing time. But we also got some frozen dumplings. The price is a bit more pricey than I remember... inflation sucks. This place is still a great go-to!"
2130,5jPaUdIjz_5u3N1gpUbwmA,2/28/2023,4 star rating,"So this place opens at 10. We got there about 10:15 on Monday and ordered at the window as there was no wait. Parking kinda is a nightmare but we got lucky and parked right in front of White Bear. We ordered the infamous #6 and Dan Dan noodles. I tried to get dumplings but they didn't have it. #6 was wonderful, definitely a 5/5. $10 for 12 wontons was definitely worth it. It's not heavy feeling, just the right amount of chili and comes out steaming. We are glad we ordered 2 of them. The Dan Dan noodles were just okay. I'd probably give it a 3/5. None of us were super impressed. After we ordered, we walked to the corner to get pasties at Tous De Jours. We probably spent less than 10 minutes in there & by the time we got back the food was done. Service was super quick. They take cash only. 2 orders of wontons and Dan Dan noodles cost us $30.We ended up eating in the car since it's definitely not a place to sit, eat & catch up. No chairs/tables. If you're in flushing, it's certainly worth the hype. Definitely give it a try if you're around there."
2131,5jPaUdIjz_5u3N1gpUbwmA,2/24/2023,5 star rating,"Quite possibly my favorite place for spicy dumplings in NYC. And a good deal for the quality I think too! $10 for 12 dumplings is not bad. I like these spicy dumplings better than the ones from Vanessa's dumplings (Vanessa's dumplings stans please don't come for me). It's a super small no frills place, literally operating out of just a window. There's no seating so we stood outside and ate them but I wouldn't hold that against this place at all. The service was good and the lady who took my order was very nice. I think I'd make the trek to Flushing from Manhattan solely for these dumplings."
2132,5jPaUdIjz_5u3N1gpUbwmA,2/21/2023,4 star rating,I've been coming here over the past couple decades and it's changed hands a couple times and even though I still like coming here for the classic red oil wontons although it's not what it used to be. This was my most recent visit and I found the wontons tasted like they had more dough than filling. I asked for light sauce but the flavor was still good. I think the service is not as good as it used to be. they closed indoor area and is only doing take out but it's classic hole in a wall ambience and a staple in Flushing for sure.
2133,5jPaUdIjz_5u3N1gpUbwmA,4/1/2023,4 star rating,"We got the #6 and it was delicious! The filling was great & it wasn't spicy at all. Although it is cash only, so don't forget!"

It is a small hole-in-the-wall shop in the heart of Flushing, with take-out only and no seating. The chili oil wontons were ready and piping hot almost immediately and were coated in a delicious hot chili oil sauce and a bit of chopped scallions.Overall, it was pretty good. They were not the best chili oil wontons I've ever had. It definitely could have used a bit more chili oil and spices/seasoning overall, and maybe a bit of garlic, but overall it was not too bad for the price and amount of wontons you receive. It was perfect to eat on a cold day. Solid 4/5 stars!"
2137,5jPaUdIjz_5u3N1gpUbwmA,1/31/2023,4 star rating,"A hole in the wall spot in Flushing thats definitely worth a try. They are currently doing take-out orders only. Ordered the chili oil wontons (#6). Overall, they were good, but I wish it was a bit spicy. They were wrapped with the right amount of filling. Definitely hits the spot if you're ever craving wontons!"
2138,5jPaUdIjz_5u3N1gpUbwmA,2/3/2023,3 star rating,"Hmm.. not sure what the rave reviews were all about. About the place, this is a tiny takeout window on one of the busiest streets in Flushing. They only take cash. Parking can be a pain but little planning could go a long way. I ordered #6 (Wontons with hot sauce). They freshly made it in front of me while I was waiting. To start off, the sauce is not hot/spicy as others noted. It's a lot of chili oil with maybe some scallions and beans. It was decent but nothing I would remember after I'm done with this review. Wontons were juicy and plump but outer layer felt thicker than ideal. Meat inside was tender and succulent. The quantity is great (12 wontons) for the price ($10). Overall, it's a decent snack to try if you are in the area but I wouldn't recommend a dedicated trip for this. Not mind-blowing but recommended!"

It has a lovely design and each dish is presented great, but the flavors did not match the look.Quality: Bangkok Degree was a bit more style than substance. Each dish was presented beautifully and the space is lovely, but I just did not love any of the food items. The Homemade Spring Rolls were my favorite bite, but the sauce dumped on top and bottom did not make sense. The Chicken Pad Thai was fine, but it lacked that sweetness needed to pull the flavors together. I did not like the Crispy Duck Rice. I thought it was going to be presented together, instead of do-it-yourself. The duck was also overcooked and tough. The Mango Sticky Rice had good flavor, but the decision to leave it in the skin just made it tough to eat.Quantity: Decent sized portions.Value: $8 for Homemade Spring Rolls. $16 for Chicken Pad Thai. $30 for Crispy Duck Rice. $10 for Mango Sticky Rice.Ambiance: Bangkok Degree is a Thai restaurant located in Park Slope. It has a very colorful and chic design. Lots of greenery, decorations, and neon lights. There is a large bar towards the back of the space, which almost gives the impression they are a cocktail bar first. The music selection was not my favorite, a weird techno mix. They also need to do something about the front door, which does not automatically close, and no one follows the sign. Every time someone comes in or out a cold gust of air fills the space.Crowd: A couple of other guests, lots of take-out orders.Service: Friendly waitress, and food was out quickly.Parking: Plenty of street parking nearby."

And as you can see from my 5 star review, the rumors are quite true.The crispy duck with massaman curry was a 10/10. The duck was deliciously tender and juicy with a nice crunchy, crispy skin on the outside layer. The curry was also so good since it was a mix of potato, onion, peanut, and coconut milk. You can taste a bit of the coconut come through in the aftertaste. Unfortunately the lychee iced tea was terrible - it had the weirdest taste ever. Just avoid this and you're golden."
2141,sMwo18huDJ_KmKoLwcrBUQ,4/1/2023,5 star rating,Best food in town. They are always nice whenever we go and the food absolutely tastes like a grandma made it with years of refined experience.
2142,sMwo18huDJ_KmKoLwcrBUQ,9/10/2022,5 star rating,"Friend and I stopped in for dinner. No wait and almost every table was taken. It look some time before our server came by to take our order and it took awhile for the food to come out.Appetizer: golden tofu (1/5)The tofu wasn't seasoned so it was just tofu and sauce. I expected it to have some sort of seasoning on it or some sort of pizaz. At least fry it with a coating so it has a nice texture. It came out really hot and really crispy (super different texture from the inside) so it was a little difficult to eat at first for those reasons. After it cooled down it was difficult to eat because it was so disappointing. Entree: drunken noodles (5/5) Ok this was good. Not much to add. Didnt finish it though, packed up the rest to go. Was still good later.Entree: crispy pork rice (5/5)Friend ordered this and said it was good. She finished her whole plate and was quiet while eating. Even though the appetizer was disappointing, everything else was good. Service was a little slow but understandable- they had a full house. The decor was beautiful. They're one of those places that plays pop songs that have been covered in one specific genre. I couldn't pinpoint the genre but the owners put some effort into setting up the vibe of the dining experience. It felt pretty calm. I didnt feel rushed. Wanted to note that their drinks looked fun and some other tables had ordered drinks. Next time I'm in the area i may come back for dinner and also try their drinks!"

We met up and went together for dinner the other night. The atmosphere was small, cozy and very nicely decorated. I wanted something with caffeine and I love Thai iced tea, so I ordered the boozy version on their cocktail menu, it also looked gorgeous. Started with the homemade spring rolls, I usually don't love these but my partner insisted and boy was I loving them, so good. Then we got wonton pad Thai and drunken noodle with crispy pork, both were delicious! The table next to us got the whole fish and it looked amazing, will definitely come here again soon."

I've been here more than 5 times since I found out about it from a friend. The roti and crabmeat friend rice is my fan favorite, never fail to order it every time I come!

We had a 7pm reservation but arrived around 6:50 and didn't have to wait. Immediately after sitting we were given menus and water and about five minutes later, our serve came back to ask us for our order. Although we weren't ready (mainly because we were chatting) I love how prompt they were.Ambiance: Its a very cute space. Wasn't too loud and nosey where you couldn't hear your conversation over dinner. I loved the grass background behind the bar as well as the florals hanging from the ceiling. Drinks: We order the Prosecco Rosé and it was delish. Food: Best edamame I've ever had. That garlic butter sauce, still licking my fingers. The calamari missed the mark a bit because the batter needed some salt BUT the dipping sauce that comes with it heavily makes up for it. Sooooo good. I ordered the BD drunken noodles which were so tasty. Spicy so if you don't like spice, skip it. My partner had the regular drunken noodles and not even an onion was left on his plate so safe to say he enjoyed it. Definitely would come back!"
2146,sMwo18huDJ_KmKoLwcrBUQ,10/24/2022,5 star rating,Bangkok Degree has to be one of the best Thai restaurants in the city. Traveling to Flatbush Brooklyn was far though it was worth it going to this place. It's a small restaurant with a few tables. It wasn't too busy on a Saturday and I was able to eat in a corner. The service was good and fast. On the menu I ordered the spicy basil fried rice and chicken Pad Thai. The fried rice was delicious and spicy indeed so order to your preference. The pad Thai was the main course I was most excited to taste. Mmm. This pad Thai was unlike any other I've tried because it definitely has that sour note that most pad Thai from other restaurants lack and the noodles were amazing. Definitely recommend Bangkok Degree.

We ordered the pad thai with squid and I was pleasantly surprised that instead of frozen squid rings, we got squid pieces that didn't taste frozen. We also got the green curry with shrimp, which was plump and on the larger size. Both dishes were well seasoned and delicious.Finally, they were very accommodating in getting us warm Thai tea instead of iced because my wife prefers warm tea. They served two portions of the tea in a tea pot and the tea was one of the better tasting ones we have had in the neighborhood. Although there's minimal outdoor seating here, they fully opened their large windows to let fresh air into the restaurant."

Hubby really enjoyed his ""Discovery"" whiskey tasting flights which included rye, scotch, Irish, and Japanese whiskey. For food we ordered the steak frites, short-rib burger, and the enchiladas. The enchiladas were my favorite- bursting with flavors. The short-rib and steak frites was decent - wish it was warmer. The steak was cold by the time I took my second bite but the sauce was delightful. We finished with the 28 layer chocolate cake. The cake was super moist and not overly sweet but we couldn't finish the big slice as you can imagine."

This place is known for their whiskeys and they had so many different options to choose from including a flight which I was tempted to get but didn't. Beautiful decor and the booth seating for me was very comfortable however the tables were close together so we got real friendly with the couples sitting next to us.

We were seated directly in front of the stage (live music), and were able to listen to a great jazz concert. I didn't feel the music was too loud at any point where we could not have a conversation.For dinner, I ordered the Miyakazi wagyu steak (with a Japanese whiskey sauce and potato gratin), and an oaxaca express cocktail (mezcal, jalapeño-agave nectar, cucumber basil juice, lime juice, with a cayenne pepper rim). I thought the steak was tender (not too much fat), but wasn't a huge fan of the whiskey sauce. I also thought the side of potato gratin was minuscule, way too small. The staff was both professional and friendly. Cool experience that I would recommend to others."

I was invited to birthday dinner and was looking forward to hanging out with friends.Establishment is very chic and upscale. Reason for my lesser stars as a foodie the meal was ok. Was expecting much more. I know I'm picky but others  in the dining party agreed. For drinks and appetizers you will be pleased. Huge book of whisky options. However the main course was a bit lack luster in flavor and mediocre in taste. Additionally I get the swanky decor but it was entirely too dark for my liking. I like ambiance but I prefer to see my food more. The desserts were also a bit disappointing. Our waiter was amazing. Very engaging and pleasant.All in all for spirit forward drinks, appetizers and live music you will enjoy.

It's not always easy to find good, or even great service at restaurants anymore here in NYC. Well, that changed for us tonight. Anthony was above and beyond with his whiskey knowledge, not to mention his service the entire time. He prepared us for each course, and even acted as our guide through the 28 layer chocolate cake that was and is...Devine. Such a great experience. You must go, and you will enjoy. Guaranteed"
2156,ZybTcEwBUeQqiiyyBpoiPQ,11/26/2022,3 star rating,"Went to Flatiron Room on a date and while the experience was good some parts could have been better. The ambiance is good, good lighting, professional looking servers/bartenders, the acoustics were good and I enjoyed the performer. I ordered the bone marrow, pork belly, Mac and cheese and a couple drinks. It was our anniversary so we got complimentary dessert which was nice. The food was good but the pork belly was almost mostly fat, there was barely any marrow on the bones. The mac and cheese was delicious and so were our drinks. But the limited menu and the less than favorable appetizers were not the vibe. I guess the focus of this spot is whiskey and music but the food was not great."
2157,ZybTcEwBUeQqiiyyBpoiPQ,3/25/2023,4 star rating,"Came to The Flatiron Room around 1am with friends and we didn't realize the kitchen closed (the kitchen closes at midnight). A friend had to take off his hat, due to the dress code, but we were able to come in even though we wore jeans. We came to enjoy drinks since we were out in the city, and coming to the Flat Iron Room was very enjoyable. There was no seats but there was a stand up table, so we gathered around to order some drinks. We ordered Casamigos Tequila shots with salt on the rim and lime and they were almost too gorgeous to drink! There was also a live band that came out and played right around when we arrived which made it a very chill environment. They were playing soft rock and the atmosphere was classy. We needed up ordering another round, but I ordered The Morning Dram Espresso Martini, to wake me up a bit since we were bar hopping. This martini was the smoothest and lightest espresso martini that I ever had. I would come back here instantly just to have another! The only reason I gave this review four stars was because we were trying to find our waitress for 10 mins, and after I told her we wanted to close our tab, she brought drinks out to the table next to us and slowly poured whiskey into glasses right in front of them...for half an hour, AND still forgot to bring us our check since she disappeared. It was very frustrating, but it was only because of that experience with the waitress. If you are looking for a classy but fun atmosphere that's not too loud, and love live music, I  really recommend the flatiron room, definitely one of my new favorite bars in the city now!"

The prices though reflect the location and ambiance. The restaurant is medium sized for NYC and very clean. The staff is professional though they don't go out of their way to serve (consider this a step up from normal Chinese service).The food is good, but not outstanding. The soup dumplings are adequate but nothing spectacular. I didn't care much for the wonton soup (a bit bland). The duck was good but a bit salty as was the bacon scallion pancakes. Overall we spent nearly $100 and it didn't seem worth the price for the quality."
2201,i6UIu3QC2aESANgOR9aycA,10/29/2022,5 star rating,"Tl;DR - Food was great, nice interior as well as has outside seating. Good service (might be because they assume we were Chinese and spoke Mandarin to us). A bit on the pricey end compared to traditional soup dumpling shops in Chinatown. Overall a great experience with delicious food.Overall Ratings - Factoring in taste, presentation, portion, and costTraditional Shanghai Pan Fried Soup Dumplings (4 Pieces) - 7/10. Tasted great and had good presentation, lost points because of portion and cost. Crispy texture with a bit of soup inside. Prefer the thicker skin and the soup was flavorful. Grandma's Pork Soup Dumplings (6 Pieces) - 8.5/10. Tasted great, nothing to really say about presentation as it came as expected in a steamer. Portion is to be expected at 6 piece like other soup dumpling shops I have been too. The price is higher than expected (compared to Chinatown), but given the area, not too outrageous. Thicker skin than normal soup dumplings and the filling of pork was really hefty, definitely more than other shops that I went to. House Special Fried Rice (Beef, Chicken, Shrimp) - 10/10. Tasted amazing, nothing to say about presentation as it came in a normal bowl, but the rice was glistening. Portion size was big enough to feed at least 2 maybe 3 hungry people. Rice was soft and light with amazing flavor, also came with multiple pieces of shrimp, chicken, and beef. It also have pieces of cha sew fried with the rice. I think this is a must have dish if you decide to come to this place. Hot & Sour Soup - 8/10. Great flavor with nothing to say about presentation as it came in another normal bowl. Can fill 3-4 small bowls. There were a lot of shitake mushrooms and it was normal hot and sour soup. It was a great balance of the spicy and sour as you can taste a hint of sour that's not overpowering. Included in the soup were mushroom, wood ear, and tofu. Would recommend this dish for family style where you can share it with multiple people."
2202,i6UIu3QC2aESANgOR9aycA,10/8/2022,4 star rating,"Love the play on word with ""Bao"" and ""Bodega"". Don't take it the wrong way though, as this ain't no cheap deli on your neighborhood block. It's pretty upscale and a bit pricier compared to the spots in Chinatown.Amongst the four of us in our group, we split a variety of items:Dan Dan Noodle ($12) - Gotta mix this bowl up as soon as it is served (after you take all the photos of course). Gotta love a good mince meat with noodles. I don't recall this being spicy, as Dan Dan Noodles at a typical Chinese restaurant is known for being spicy.Crab Roe Soup Dumplings (6 pieces) ($12) - They offer one pan fried, but two pieces less, so if you want the most bang for you buck, stick with the regular steamed ones. They're actually pretty decent as well.Hot Pot Fish ($25) - You want spicy, this is it. They serve this with it's own portable flame stand, so you know they're serious about it. It's a cute presentation besides that. Super tender fish, but if you want it to be spicy, make sure it's submerged in the broth.Grandma Braised Pork ($23) - My favorite primarily because I love pork belly. Great sauce flavoring, the pork is phenomenally made (just like grandma would), and the Bok Choy complements the pork really well. Make sure to get some of the white rice too!Overall the food is great. The service could use some work. We also had a baby with us and the person coming out of the kitchen serving these hot food, especially the Hot Pot Fish, was not being very cautious. He acted like the baby knew to get out of the way, while we all know that ain't gonna happen.Also worth noting that they charge a credit card fee of 4%."

Every dish was incredible and full of flavor. My favorite was the mini peking duck baos - crispy skin, juicy meat, and tangy sauce!

2204,i6UIu3QC2aESANgOR9aycA,10/14/2022,2 star rating,"Great location, nice environment and good service. I had a good lunch here. There are only two disappointments: the food and the price.This is located at an expensive place and the dining environment is good, so the expensive price can be justified. The food here tasted far away from what their name 小杨生煎 would suggest.  The meat in the noodles and the baos tasted a hint of vinegar, reminding me of my childhood in Northern China: when we had to cook non-fresh meat, instead of throwing them away, we used vinegar to cover the bad odors.  The soup of the noodles lacked the umami taste, and was too salty.  The meat ball inside the bao was too tight and tasted off.  The sauce for the bao was also a mystery.I would recommend this place if you need to have a generic upscale (meaning expensive) meal without expecting to have Shanghai food, or if you have no idea what Shanghai food should taste like anyway."
2205,i6UIu3QC2aESANgOR9aycA,10/15/2022,4 star rating,"Baodega is a restaurant that serves dishes that are so homey.

2207,i6UIu3QC2aESANgOR9aycA,1/22/2022,4 star rating,"Great spot for a variety of authentic Shanghainese dishes in a clean, open space. I came for dinner and tried 4 different dishes: 1. Roast pork bun ($7.50)- This was a large bun with a savory filling of pork and onions, and the bun itself was nice and fluffy. 2. Steamed shrimp crystal dumplings (4 for $8.50)- Classic dim sum option, which did not disappoint. 3. Braised meat ball noodle soup ($19)- Noodles were cooked well and the soup was flavorful; meat balls were large and tasty. 4. Egg tarts (2 for $8.50)- Had to order this classic delicious treat; this one was a bit more egg-forward rather than custard-tasting compared to others, but still very good. As a whole, I'd say the prices were a bit high, but still somewhat reasonable.The restaurant interior is quite large and very clean. It also has some elegant decor with a casual atmosphere. I came on a Friday night, and there were only a few other people dining in. The owner was the one who seated us and took our order, and he seemed friendly.Overall, I would recommend Baodega if you are looking for high quality Chinese food (especially if you're looking for Shanghainese food) in a nice setting. Compared to other Shanghainese places outside of Manhattan (like in Flushing), Baodega might be a little pricier (still quite affordable though), but as a result, you can dine in a quieter, cleaner setting without the typical hustle-and-bustle surrounding you."

When you get there you will see they took very seriously the no-contact pickup! They've built a door frame to make sure you don't come in contact with anybody, a speaker system to place your order, an outdoor card reader, and a drawer to provide your order.I tried their cappuccino because it was too early for their bubble tea (I went right when they opened, they said the tapioca would be about 45 min) and was not disappointed. Their plain croissant was forgettable."

One of them was a lemonade black tea that was really tasty. The other one was their regular milk tea which also is very good. They have super friendly service here as well.Parking is tricky, but the same can be said about getting with your mother. Now that's some parking that's truly tricky. And yet everyone in town has managed it.So this is one of three very good bubble tea shops in Astoria. This neighbourhood is definitely spoiled for nice little bubble tea shops. Williamsburg should take a memo from here. Tea & Milk is the gold standard but Teapsy and Infinitea are both yumz AF.Now in my infinitea wisdom I'm ending this review."

However, their delivery service and quality is abysmal. One time a couple weeks ago, the poke I ordered smelled horrible. I was so hungry so I tried a few bites and found out that the bean curd is stale and should be thrown away. So I ended up throw the whole thing away.Today I ordered delivery and the delivery person called plus texted me when he arrived. I searched everywhere in my building and no food is found. I then called the restaurant and a very rude man picked up the phone to tell me that this order was never received and hung up, even though I said that I saw in the app for confirmed delivery. Long story short - It's a great experience and food is fresh when you dine in. But be careful when you order delivery because the food could be stale and you may have bad experience with delivery."

What I love about Astoria is that every few blocks, there is a cute sit-down / work cafe situation. Pre-pandemic, Infinitea was that place near Astoria Blvd and 21st. During COVID times, they've been takeout-only, but the order and pick up window is super efficient and creatively done. In addition, I always come here when I need a bubble tea fix. They also have poke, sushi, and ramen, which I have not tried but plan to in the future. Their drinks are really pretty AND delicious! A little bit on the pricier side, but good for an afternoon pick me up or if you need to treat yourself."

Had no idea they had gone above and beyond when it comes to no-contact pickup! They've built a setup including a speaker system, outdoor card reader, and a drawer to provide your order. It is 100% the best no-contact setup I have seen so far. That said, the slush was also great! Will definitely be back to try more of their menu."

They have way more than tea which was unexpected: avocado toast, poke, sushi burritos, coffee, acai bowls, smoothies, you name it. I got the rose milk bubble tea at 50% sweet, and it was life changing. My friend got the acai bowl, and it was well worth it apparently. Another friend got the avocado toast, and it was loaded with avocado, seeds, and feta. The shop itself is so cute too!"
2216,i6UIu3QC2aESANgOR9aycA,5/30/2020,4 star rating,"While the bubble tea flavor options are not as infinite as I had hoped, they have a number of varieties  as well as pastries and sushi. Plus they are open at 9 AM, perfect for an early weekend treat. To note, sushi is not available until after 10:30 AM. I tried to get a sushi burrito at 9:45 AM and was disappointed. Sushi for breakfast should definitely be a thing!I got the taro milk tea and the passion mango slush. The passionfruit mango slush actually had little black specks of passionfruit seeds, a good sign. Both were flavorful but balanced - the taro did not have the fake flowery taste that some taro milk teas have and the slush was not overly icy or sweet. I was most impressed by how they had outfitted their business to adapt to COVID restrictions. Ordering is done outside, with a window between you and the staff. The order window has a sliding tray so that there is no contact between customers and staff in retrieving the order. I also saw the employee sanitize the drawer several times while I was waiting. The only suggestion I would have is to make it clear where the ordering line begins, there were 5 people already waiting when I got there and I could not tell who had ordered or who was next in line."

I bought a small size of double layer carrot cake in the tin container they sold on the refrigerator along with a small portion of Fran. The carrot cake dough was very dried with not much taste of carrot. The heavy frosting was super sweet and gave me a taste of stale margarine flavor aftertaste. I am very disappointed. The Fran was ok, but not overly high praised. On top of that, this place will charge you 4% fee if you use credit card. Thanks god, I got cash! Not sure this extra fee to customers is legal."

The cake is so yummy and there's rarely any leftovers at the end of the day. I love this cake mainly because the nuts that line the outside of the cake are a nice touch. The cake itself isn't too spongy or dry and there's just the right amount of icing on top. They do not make you pay extra to have a message written on the cake. The carrots muffins are also a good option for a snack or for smaller groups when you don't need an entire cake. I love these because they give you a generous amount of muffin top, which is my favorite part about any muffin. However, it doesn't come with icing and nuts. Maybe I've just been lucky, but every time I've ordered a carrot muffin, I always get a warm one and it pairs perfectly with coffee."

They don't skimp on the walnuts, or icing, both of which I really appreciated. I also got the flan. It had a nice, smooth and velvety texture with a butterscotch caramel taste like the sauce is supposed to have.

The pastrami looked like store bought lunch meat that they sliced and then tossed on a grill. The sandwich was very dry and nothing better than making one at home with supermarket deli meet. I'm giving it a 3 star because it wasn't severely overpriced and my wife and kids enjoyed their bagels. Not a lot of options in Times Square.

I work here (wah) and there are very few delis to grab a quality sandwich. This place does a good job - chicken cutlets are great and their toppings (avacado, cheeses etc.) all seem fresh enough. Their bagels seem subpar for NYC but they do serve breakfast sandwiches all day which is an A+ in my book. Also anyone complaining about a $10 sandwich is clearly not from Manhattan.... I don't even think there is a times square premium in there - seriously where do you all get your sandwiches for less!!? This is a no seating/no frills spot where I can quickly order a decent sandwich and leave with limited hassling/contact from tourists. For times square that's good enough for me."

I ordered an ice cream cake for my husband's birthday cake a few weeks before his birthday, and went to pick it up the day of. I had ordered it for a 1 PM pickup, and I asked when it would be ready in case I sent someone else to pick it up. They said it would be ready the night before. I ordered a special cake with a vanilla-vanilla interior, since that's what my husband prefers. We got there at close to 2 PM to pickup our ice cream cake on the day it was due and the cake still wasn't ready. We had come later because our child was in the car, and he was screaming in the parking lot while my husband and I were running in and out of Carvel trying to figure out why the cake wasn't ready. She apologized profusely and I asked her why it wasn't ready when I was told it was going to be ready the night before. She apologized, and said I know it was. She also took our receipt for the information, so it seems as though they had lost their copy of the receipt and this was why the cake wasn't ready. The thing that bothered me most, though, was that I said this cake was for my husband (aka a man), and there were hearts drawn over the cake. What man in his 30s wants hearts drawn on his birthday cake. Not one, unless it's maybe made by their child."

However, when I stopped in to purchase a cake recently, I was extremely disappointed by the lack of options. The freezers that were once full, had only a handful of cakes in them. The customer service I experienced that day was also terrible. My questions were met with one word responses & the girl who wrote the birthday message on my cake looked like she could've cared less about being there. In addition to that, when I cut into the cake in the evening, expecting to find even layers of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, I found that most of the cake was chocolate with only a thin layer of vanilla on top, and there were barely any crunchies. It's safe to say I won't be coming to this Carvel location again."

Service is trash the person who takes your order and makes the order is one of the rudest individuals I've encountered in the food service business. I'm not speaking off one experience it's been two isolated experiences.1) SMALL BILLS- My family and I came to order ice cream and upon giving our order we were scolded by a lady claiming that ""it's ridiculous that you don't have small bills"" she went on to explain the owner is going to yell at her because we had given her a $50.00. This is not an exaggeration it happened. The customers behind had to tell her to calm down and switched two 20 and a 10 so she could calm down. She thought it was ok to spazz our in a customer. 2) just left carvel for the last time. Today the same elder lady decided to spazz our because I itally she asked for my order upon giving her three orders she said ""stop let me make this and hen go on"" so as she's making it I'm telling her I want hot fudge and she didn't leave enough room and decides to start to spazz out on me because it's inconvenient for her. Mind you that's all carvel does makes ice cream and today there was no one behind me.Moral of this story this lady is the rudest most disrespectful individual. Don't believe me read the most recent reviews others feel the same way. She's an elder dirty blonde hair lady. Everytime I've come she seems so upset to serve ice cream if you don't like your job QUIT! Being miserable and treating others like that is disgusting. The Service is HORRIBLE, she'll see you waiting and ignore you till she has to ask your order then exhale like she's carrying the world on her shoulders. Relax it's ice cream you're not running the country To the owner we've come here all our lives the standards have dropped since we've encountered her way of working hopefully you fix it cause a lot of other people that we see when we go there are as disgusted with her way of treating customersYou lost a life long customer today."

Pepperoni, pepper turkey, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, roasted peppers, oil, salt, and pepper. Nothing special about the flavors but definitely hit the spot! My dad did a custom sandwich with pesto chicken, Swiss cheese, roasted peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, lettuce, tomato, and oil. Also on a torpedo. His was actually better than mine! Still nothing special, but definitely a solid sandwich.We also got a piece of red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting. The guy said it was cheesecake on top, but definitely wasn't. Still good, just expected cheesecake. The actual red velvet cake was super moist and delicious. Would I go back?

2251,vEKp_0567-O40OGriIUaHg,5/12/2017,4 star rating,"This is a 3.5 star review..This place opens 24/7.First off, it's tough to have restaurants that are open  late in the evening. I stayed at a hotel nearby and needed to have a late meal. This place was a few blocks away from me so I decided to give it a try.When you walk inside, you will see a display of fruits (bananas, apples) in front of the store. Walking inside further, you will as a cashier, grill and assortment of grocery like items. They were serving soup even late into the evening. Kudos to them for having soup available. We had the chicken noodle soup, Phillips cheesesteak, fries and veggie omelette. The chicken noodle soup is a late night food that will satisfy your needs and hunger. The Philly cheesesteak is okay (lack of seasoning) but their fries are hot and crispy. Definitely loved the fries. Their veggie omelette is a thumbs down for me. It was very bland that lacked seasoning such as salt and better.Also, their prices were a bit high. Just make sure you avoid their omelettes. They also sell various drinks here to satisfy your thirst. The staff here are very nice which is surprising as they work through the long late night hours. At the time, they only had 1 staff working the grill area and another staff working at cashier. So it was a 2 person work environment.Overall, this place is good for late night eating. You will see tons of working professionals coming here late at night after getting off work. Their chicken noodle soup and their crispy fries are one of the reasons why I will come back. One thing I would work on is seasoning your food. At times, we needed to put salt and pepper to our food as there was no flavor in their omelettes and sandwiches."
2252,vEKp_0567-O40OGriIUaHg,1/17/2020,5 star rating,"This review and rating is based on the numerous deli options in the immediate FiDi (East of Battery park & west of Fulton st) as I believe we have about 8-10. Since there the only one that's open 24/7 with delivery that is in house (way better then Grubhub supplying the delivery) as they always have someone in the area. Usually under 45 minutes except on Friday and Saturday night since it's the best option in the area, it gets busy. Since they are so busy the food is always fresh, specifically their deli cuts which are bores head. That speaks for itself in terms of deli meats as it's typical yet top quality. I generally get chicken cutlet sandwich's with the works and customize the hell out of my order whiCh they legit get right 100% of the time. I recommend their curly fries as a side as it's a small feel for a legit potion of crispy ass curls of heaven. In terms of breakfast I'd go with their flatbread sandwiches over their bagels (what some places call a European flatbread aka a bomb pita). Also ""garlic bread"" your hero's as it's hands down the best sandwich option they have. Can't speak highly enough of these guys as they are A+ in terms of their customer service. One issue is they don't always hear the phone as it gets busy and generally have two guys working the counter (cook and register) with everyone else out for delivery.  Keep it up and thanks for the lunch to 4am goodness!"

They really pack on the meat and toppings for you for a good price. I enjoyed a roast beef sandwich (including a pickle!) for $7.95 which is the deli standard, however, I didn't realize how much meat I would get for that amount! I was very please and full from my lunch. They rebuilt this place a few years back after Hurricane Sandy and the inside has plenty of seating.Along with sandwiches they have salads, soups and hot dishes that you can pick up anytime. They deliver too which could be convenient if you can't (or don't want to!) leave your desk or bed."

Gyro platter came with lettuce, tomato, red onion, very thin grilled chicken, cut up pita slices... and my fries. The chicken was not seasoned, and it was extremely dry.

We had the chicken noodle soup, Phillips cheesesteak, fries and veggie omelette. The chicken noodle soup is a late night food that will satisfy your needs and hunger. The Philly cheesesteak is okay (lack of seasoning) but their fries are hot and crispy. Definitely loved the fries. Their veggie omelette is a thumbs down for me. It was very bland that lacked seasoning such as salt and better.Also, their prices were a bit high. Just make sure you avoid their omelettes. They also sell various drinks here to satisfy your thirst. The staff here are very nice which is surprising as they work through the long late night hours.

2291,zjks9r34-5cw9FrONfpsCg,1/4/2021,4 star rating,"Drinks review only, late night adventure in Williamsburg and a not-so-unusual bubble tea craving.Last week, we were in the area trying to get some desserts from Milk next door after a run to the birria taco truck down the street. One Yelp search later, I discovered that Savory Thai has a good pre-made Taro milk tea and overall milk tea selection. The boba or tapioca bubbles leave something to be desired. I would suggest not chilling them in the fridge to keep the tapioca starch balls from solidifying.Service is great, host even brought our drinks outside as we waited.Would want to try the Chicken Thai fried rice next time."
2292,zjks9r34-5cw9FrONfpsCg,5/7/2022,5 star rating,"Great food ! Great service. Ann was the sweetest and so accommodating. Me and my friends were insanely hungry and Savory Thai did not disappoint. Between the 3 of us, we ordered the fried tofu, Thai wings, curry puffs (amaziiiing), yellow curry, pad see ew, and the drunken noodles -- ALL fantastic. Definitely looking forward to coming back here."
2293,zjks9r34-5cw9FrONfpsCg,12/28/2020,4 star rating,"I'm basing this review off of a one time visit, but, because it was so good, I went back for a second order later in the day :)The food was absolutely delish, fresh and prepared very well.  We had two orders of duck, the second order was a little more fatty than the first. The cold Thai tea was so good! And I've ordered Thai tea before, which never appealed to me, but this cup was something I'd order again in an heartbeat. The spicy fried rice is just that, spicy.  SO, if you don't like the heat, make sure you are very clear that you want mild.  I'm knocking a star from this review for two reasons, one because they did mess my order up by giving me spicy and not mild, which I asked for; the other reason, I can't attest for consistency.  Sometimes we all luck out on a great meal our first visits. I live in NJ, but the next time I'm in Brooklyn, I will make my way over to Williamsburg."

You can choose an entree which comes with a free appetizer and a drink for $1. If you check in on Yelp, they actually give you a free drink (Thai iced tea or iced coffee). I ordered the basil sauce with chicken as the entree and the egg rolls for the appetizer. For the drink, I ordered the iced coffee. The basil sauce was flavorful and there was a good ratio of vegetables to chicken. The egg rolls were okay, I would try the Tom yum soup next time. The iced coffee was very sweet and tasted like a mocha drink. My meal came out to be under $11 which was really affordable considering how much food they give you. I'm looking forward to trying some of their other entrees the next time I go."

Anyway, knowing this and usually avoiding McDonalds altogether except for their occasional breakfast trips, I decided to come here out of desperation due to hunger. Though their breakfast menu is available all day now (something I always maintained they should've done), I don't trust ordering breakfast at any other time from most locations, because they'll tend to half ass it - so I was glad this was the morning when most of the options are already there.Coming inside, this place was crowded and noisy. It's fairly sizable considering it's Manhattan location (about 2 blocks from MSG). I just wanted a simple bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit, with a hash brown, and a small orange juice (served now in bottles). I saw their banner and while I wasn't expecting anything less than a standard McDonalds experience, I was happy it was there when I needed it. It was very busy inside. While standing in line, there were at least two customer issues with something and whether or not they were actually right or not (1 was, the other wasn't), they insisted on yelling as loud as they could and one of them almost seemed aggressive. While the employees here were not the best I've ever seen, they seemed to handle these customers well despite the customers' behaviors. They remained calm, though some of the other ones were distracted from their own jobs away from the customer issues that they'd stop what they were doing to gawk at their coworkers getting verbally harassed. Most of the employees though seemed to handle the madness pretty well. While McDonalds is McDonalds, this location was very loud and a lot of customers were acting like they were in their own living rooms instead of in a public space. I would question taking younger kids here with some of the very loud and vulgar talk that a few of them were engaging in - not to mention the two customers in line shouting at the employees with little to no regard to anyone else. I get it, you're frustrated whether you're right or not, but just because someone is behind a counter doesn't give you the right to talk the way you're talking - even more so when there are kids in line. Maybe I came at the wrong time, but I can only go by what I experienced in the time I was here. There was someone cleaning the tables quickly as people were leaving, which is always a plus. Some of the seats had cushions instead of that hard plastic that most locations have. A nice innovation was the monitor showing your order and when it being made and served. Whether it was fast or slow, depends - though mine was simple enough and the wait time was minimal. They still shouted my number anyway. The breakfast was as standard McDonalds as could be, but I knew what I was paying for. All in all, just an option in a busy area with a lot of likely better food choices.

2340,aUGq0Cy4yNkBlwzDP2OTbQ,10/22/2018,3 star rating,"I come here a few times a month. The salads are good, and you get a lot for the value - usually around $10 for a salad. Depending how hungry I am, I can sometimes split one into two meals. My go to is usually the California salad. In the spring, I love their wasabi caesar. I tried the buffalo caesar once but wasn't too crazy about it. I recently tried the Thai chicken crunch and surprised myself how much I liked it. The spicy Thai peanut dressing was an interesting flavor and different that what I've typically ordered in the past. Their ingredients have always been fresh in my experience, unlike some other salad chains that I've tried.If you buy one of their reusable bowls for $1 and bring it back each time (clean of course), you will get 1 free premium topping (cheese, nuts, avocado) or two free regular toppings. I really wish they had a list of the toppings posted and what category they fall under because it can be hard to remember sometimes.They also have wraps, warm bowls, avocado toast, soups and smoothies but I haven't tried any of those yet. They occasionally do smoothie deals in the afternoons so I plan to try one eventually. One thing I don't like is the chaotic atmosphere. I get that it's popular, and thats great for the business, but I always feel a bit anxious every time I come here. The line can often be out the door, but it moves fast. Whether it be trying to locate my salad maker or checking out, it's never a completely smooth process. It's also so loud in there that I feel like I'm yelling my responses to their questions. Maybe they just need more locations, like Starbuck's!"

2342,aUGq0Cy4yNkBlwzDP2OTbQ,11/6/2019,4 star rating,"Good habits die hard sometimes, and after years of going to to this Just Salad on almost a daily basis I fell out of the habit and had not gone for quite some time.  Upon my return recently I was shocked at how much had changed.  Physically the entire space had been renovated.  Gone were the orange, white and green colors of the past.  Now blues and whites dominated the decor with a dash of grey.  Not just that, but the counter that once wrapped around the restaurant in an ""L"" shape, but now the main space is wide open with the counter pushed towards the back of the restaurant.  There is seating along the front window and off to the side.I have been going after work (they are open til 10PM) so I have not had to deal with any crazy crowds like you would see at lunch time.  Still, a lot of changes have been made to the process of getting a salad.  In the past you either ordered a pre-set salad or put together your own.  The person behind the counter would then chop it up and add in the dressing etc.  Nowadays, all the ingredients are pre-chopped.  Also, if you are using one of their reusable bowls (worth it!) they will no longer put the lid on to prevent potential cross contamination.  You have to do that yourself.  They are very careful not to use their hands to touch anything with hands, using utensils and tongs.Unfortunately, my favorite salad (the Turkey Health Cobb) was eliminated from the menu a while ago.  However, I have found others I like including the California.  Add on the Smokey Poblano dressing (thank goodness they still have that) and it's amazing.While much has changed my affection for Just Salad remains the same."

Today out of all days uber eats decided to send my order to a different location. When I went downstairs to pick up my order which was not there, Steve totally hooked me up-knowing that I was pressed for time-he immediately took charge and made my salad and my soup which I am now enjoying! They have always been great with me and everyone at my firm! We love this location and unequivocally recommend it to anyone! Thanks Steve-you're the man!"

Recently started coming to the Murray Hill location and I'm shocked (in a good way) at all that has changed. The menu is completely revamped and expanded. I absolutely love the new ingredient options - especially the chicken thighs (more flavor). My go-to salad is the Chicken Pita (pictured). Chicken poblano salad is also great. They offer a lot of vegetarian options now as well. The place is clean and the staff are super friendly. Like most chains of course, the salads are overpriced, but at least Just Salad is slightly less expensive than SweetGreen. Salads come out to $11-12 with tax."

2348,aUGq0Cy4yNkBlwzDP2OTbQ,2/26/2019,1 star rating,Seriously this place just needs to get their shit together on getting the ordered correct. Been a couple months since I have ordered here and I thought I would give it another shot... Well lo and behold give me the WRONG DRESSING AGAIN.....What's worse is that now to ask the restaurant to send in the correct dressing need to text some random number and let them know what wrong. Took me about 15 minutes to get my point across...Would be better to have a direct number to the store itself versus texting back and forth for 15 minutes just to get the right dressing for the salad. Essentially lost my appetite by then.
2349,aUGq0Cy4yNkBlwzDP2OTbQ,8/1/2022,5 star rating,Best place in town!!! I went to the location on 39th and Third AVE. And got my self a delicious chipotle cowboy salad and the staff was amazing. Shoutout to Alex who was excellent taking my order!
2350,aUGq0Cy4yNkBlwzDP2OTbQ,10/22/2018,3 star rating,"I come here a few times a month. The salads are good, and you get a lot for the value - usually around $10 for a salad. Depending how hungry I am, I can sometimes split one into two meals. My go to is usually the California salad. In the spring, I love their wasabi caesar. I tried the buffalo caesar once but wasn't too crazy about it. I recently tried the Thai chicken crunch and surprised myself how much I liked it. The spicy Thai peanut dressing was an interesting flavor and different that what I've typically ordered in the past. Their ingredients have always been fresh in my experience, unlike some other salad chains that I've tried.If you buy one of their reusable bowls for $1 and bring it back each time (clean of course), you will get 1 free premium topping (cheese, nuts, avocado) or two free regular toppings. I really wish they had a list of the toppings posted and what category they fall under because it can be hard to remember sometimes.They also have wraps, warm bowls, avocado toast, soups and smoothies but I haven't tried any of those yet. They occasionally do smoothie deals in the afternoons so I plan to try one eventually. One thing I don't like is the chaotic atmosphere. I get that it's popular, and thats great for the business, but I always feel a bit anxious every time I come here. The line can often be out the door, but it moves fast. Whether it be trying to locate my salad maker or checking out, it's never a completely smooth process. It's also so loud in there that I feel like I'm yelling my responses to their questions. Maybe they just need more locations, like Starbuck's!"
2351,aUGq0Cy4yNkBlwzDP2OTbQ,7/20/2022,1 star rating,Half star if I could. Order on Uber eats a few times now and not once was it even close to what I ordered. Otherwise this place could be good.
2352,aUGq0Cy4yNkBlwzDP2OTbQ,11/6/2019,4 star rating,"Good habits die hard sometimes, and after years of going to to this Just Salad on almost a daily basis I fell out of the habit and had not gone for quite some time.  Upon my return recently I was shocked at how much had changed.  Physically the entire space had been renovated.  Gone were the orange, white and green colors of the past.  Now blues and whites dominated the decor with a dash of grey.  Not just that, but the counter that once wrapped around the restaurant in an ""L"" shape, but now the main space is wide open with the counter pushed towards the back of the restaurant.  There is seating along the front window and off to the side.I have been going after work (they are open til 10PM) so I have not had to deal with any crazy crowds like you would see at lunch time.  Still, a lot of changes have been made to the process of getting a salad.  In the past you either ordered a pre-set salad or put together your own.  The person behind the counter would then chop it up and add in the dressing etc.  Nowadays, all the ingredients are pre-chopped.  Also, if you are using one of their reusable bowls (worth it!) they will no longer put the lid on to prevent potential cross contamination.  You have to do that yourself.  They are very careful not to use their hands to touch anything with hands, using utensils and tongs.Unfortunately, my favorite salad (the Turkey Health Cobb) was eliminated from the menu a while ago.  However, I have found others I like including the California.  Add on the Smokey Poblano dressing (thank goodness they still have that) and it's amazing.While much has changed my affection for Just Salad remains the same."

My dining companion said that theirs was too sweet, but that's easily fixable because they have different options for sugar levels. My poke bowl was also delicious. Everything tasted fresh which is sometimes a hit or miss with poke places. Trutea was definitely a hit! The perfect amount of everything in my bowl, so each forkful had some of everything. The protein I got was spicy salmon (it was a purée kind of texture which I didn't expect -usually I see more of a cube texture in poke). Still soo tasty. You got to choose 2 proteins for medium size (3 for large), 5 toppings (for medium), and unlimited crunchy toppings! ALSO, we got free miso soup with our poke!!! Amazing  Through their promo, Our meal was buy one get one 50% off bubble tea + 15% off poke! It's their deal of the month which is such a good buy, I recommend!"

However, I was disappointed with my experience here yesterday. My boyfriend and I both ordered large strawberry lemonade punches with bubbles on our app. We crave this drink and it's always perfect, refreshing, and sweet on a hot day. The bubbles make it nice and filling. Well, our punch was good, but there was a very sad amount of bubbles in our drinks. Usually there are so many bubbles and we are drinking a bunch of bubbles at the end by themselves. In these drinks, we both agreed that the quantity of bubbles was way less than what we were used to and it was really disappointed because 1) we each splurged on a $6 drink and 2) the bubbles are the best part. As customers, we appreciate consistency and there was a lack of consistency here. I don't think I'd go back to this location again. :("

It happens to be right around the corner from my apartment, so I'll stop in from time to time when I need a boba or a fruity drink.As a fairly consistent customer over the past 2 years, their boba fluctuates from very good to okay depending on the visit. On occasion, the tapioca has been undercooked giving it a firm/gritty texture. When the boba is like that, it really ruins the experience of the drink. Other times, the tapioca is perfectly soft and chewy. I will say, the flavor of the tapioca at Kung Fu is by far my favorite boba flavor wise.The flavor of the tea is good. I usually get the typical milk tea. The milk (i believe it's all alternative milk) always looks very pale, and like there's not much tea. I wish it was richer in tea flavor and less creamy.All around, it's definitely a good place to grab a drink if you're walking around the hood, but I wouldn't call this a destination for boba connoisseurs."

There is good bubble tea and I really like the pork buns but the last time I went they added something to my drink that I've never had in it before and it tasted very bad. It's was probably a mistake but it was just awful. Usually it's great tho.

I ordered the honey milk tea with boba and pudding at regular sugar and regular ice. I didn't drink it until I got home and I thought that it was pretty good but too sweet. I figured that it would be enough ice (I've gotten this one several times at different locations). I think next time, I would get less sugar and keep the ice at regular. Also, this location has macarons and Asian snacks--I don't recall seeing these at other Kung Fu Tea locations. The employees were polite and offered to help if I had questions. I will say that this place is pretty small--I don't recall seeing a place to sit, so I would plan on carrying out.I look forward to coming back and maybe venturing out and trying something different--we'll see."

There is a tiny bar up in the front room and saloon-style seating (think wooden chairs, barrels, etc) and tables in the back. I was pleasantly surprised to see drinks were in the $10 range. Score!  But found that the drinks were just okay; there was nothing really special about them.  I wouldn't venture up here just for this bar, but might be something to peruse if you're in the area."

2422,Hm69skfQVxxToBm_VeZuVg,5/8/2015,4 star rating,"Want a good example for ""quiet greatness""? Look no further than the Guthrie Inn. There's nothing fancy about this speakeasy-esque spot. There's very little in terms of decoration, dim lighting, only one bartender, and a menu that doesn't exactly scream ""high end cocktail bar"". But don't let all of that deceive you - this place is, wait for it, QUIETLY GREAT!Came here on a Thursday night to find it quite empty. I went with a fellow cocktail nut, so when he recommended the Guthrie, I figured his word was good. We quickly got two seats at the bar and started quite the journey of a night.We're both the type of person who loves to schmooze with bartenders. Not in a weird/stalky/creepy way, just out of general interest/curiosity. This guy, Francisco, was awesome. We talked all things Manhattan drinking culture. And eventually, after studying the menu for a few minutes, I participated in said culture. And though the menu doesn't stand out as being exceptional, the drinks were still close to top of the line.I can't remember the name of the first drink I ordered, but if I'm remembering correctly, it had bourbon, amaretto, sweet vermouth and brown sugar in it. Thick and syrupy sweet. If the combo souds generally appealing to you but you're not into sugar rushes, our new friend Francisco recommends passing on the sweet vermouth, or just adding a little splash. BUT the star of the evening was the Sharpie Mustache. I remember the name because.....how could you forget a name like that? I was wary of ordering it because the base seemed so outlandish to me - gin and rye. I mean, I'm not saying I'm an expert mixologist or anything, but I would never think to combine those liquors in a cocktail. At least not if I'm intending on drinking it....But our pal Francisco assured me that this drink was THE drink to get. He told us that he drank so many of them when he first started working at the Guthrie that he's sick of them at this point. I don't know how you could possibly get sick of this drink, but then again, I'm not a bartender. As the name suggests, this is SHARP. Like, eye-poppingly sharp. Like, I think my eyes actually did one of those cartoon-bulge type things. Okay, I wouldn't be a good Yelper if I withheld one of the negatives. At one point, our new friend left. I'm not exactly sure where he went. And by our new friend, I mean the bartender. As in, the only person working there. So...be glad I'm not a klepto?Lastly: We ended up befriending another lovely individual that night, who was none other than Francisco's girlfriend. You know when you have one of those nights that seems like one of those classic New York experiences? Thursday night was just that. Sometimes I forget that New Yorkers are not just balls of animosity that don't give a damn about anyone else but themselves - it's easy to get jaded here. The purpose of that little musing is to say that we befriended an awesome couple, and before the night was over, we did shots of Jack with them. Cheers, New York!"

You may need to add a little gusto to get it open.The Guthrie Inn is a virtual speakeasy, all dim lighting, light seating, and a definite lack of obvious signage. And they serve cocktails. It's a short walk from the 96th Street Lexington station; you'll be sipping fizzy there faster than you can bat your eyelashes.We ended up here accidentally while lamenting the early close of a neighboring bar[1]. I don't know what inspired us to check next door, but luckily we did. During our inaugural visit, a lone bartender[2] served us at the bar, introducing me to a whiskey I've never had. His pour was mean. He might've told jokes.Stop in solo, with a date, or with a few friends. It's that kind of place.[1] Earl's Beer and Cheese, if you're curious. It was a weeknight, so it probably wasn't fair to lament as hard as we did.[2] I've since forgotten the identity of our mystery bartender, but the current bartenders are just as welcoming."
2424,Hm69skfQVxxToBm_VeZuVg,3/16/2018,3 star rating,"A little unclear what kind of vibe this place is going for or what they want to ""be known for"" -- not that every place should strive for that -- but it's strange how unmemorable this place is. Putting negative connotations aside, I mean that in neither a good or bad way. When it's empty you might have a shot at getting the shuffleboard at the back, which is fun.When I asked the bartender what stouts or dark beers they had, she responded with ""We have Guinness and a new IPA"" ...It's an okay place to drop in for a drink at night if you don't want to go farther away from this area."

2426,Hm69skfQVxxToBm_VeZuVg,4/28/2018,3 star rating,"Great cocktails and a good atmosphere. The service has been a bit hit or miss for me each time I've been, which is why I give it 3 stars. The core menu of cocktails is delicious, and if you go when it's warm they open the window out front which is really nice. Good for small groups (in the back) or a date. I wouldn't go here solo, as the vibe isn't as much of a meet & chat one as it is at Earls next door."
2427,Hm69skfQVxxToBm_VeZuVg,9/22/2014,4 star rating,"Speakeasy type bar on the nether regions of the UES that you can occassionally find me face down at. In a good way! Not much up this way other than the terrific Earl's Beer and Cheese. It's right next door and the area it's in looks like an underdeveloped country. The views across the street are basically of the subway heading underground and some apartment buildings. That being said it's a nice reprieve to hide away in this dark and seemingly obscure spot for an exceptional cocktail.The Guthrie Inn, though small in stature, packs quite a hefty punch when it comes to proper libations. You might find me sprawled out on the cozy leather couches in the darkly lit back room sipping on a Sidecar, Old Fashioned, and even a Sharpie Mustache. The classic cocktail list is one that takes a page out of the Roaring 20's to Maltese Falcon era of men wearing fedoras and the ladies in demure vintage dresses. The bartenders are quite the mixologists with a wonderful encyclopedia of drink recipes stored away and ready to go at your request.Every drink I have encountered here has been excellent, and never have regretted any choice that passed my lips. The place itself exudes a relaxed vibe, and the patrons here reflect that as you won't find the frat boy crowd that populates a lot of the UES bar scene. Cocktails are in the $10-$12 range, and the menu of options reads more like quality over quantity. Decent bourbon list to choose from too. Great choice to bring a date if up this way. Not much by way of seating but the front area also opens up a bit to let in some fresh air. Chill atmosphere. Quality cocktails. A bit sexy and seductive. Earls Beer and Cheese next door. Whoa! What is happening up here on the far Upper East Side? This strange new land actually has some good things going on all of a sudden."
2428,Hm69skfQVxxToBm_VeZuVg,1/26/2017,4 star rating,I like it. Chill atmosphere. Intimate neighborhood bar. I feel like this is the kind of place where it's just small enough that you could be recognized as a regular. The prices are on par with other bars in UES. $7 a pint on average. Selection is decent and changes month to month. They'll make any cocktail you want. Close to my work place. The locals all chat with each other. It's like my very own dimly lit hipster Cheers.

We came for the drink specials as well, but those don't start until later in the day, so we paid $14 for a Craft beet and a tall boy tecate. Not bad but for the price, we probably should have gone somewhere else.The place is a cool dive bar vibe and lots of fun stuff to look at, I'm sure it's even more fun late night, but we came around 2:30pm and it wasn't very busy.We will have to come back and give this place another try. Mainly came here because it was dog friendly and the bartender was really sweet with our dogs so that's a plus! Until next time! Cheers!"

Bartenders are super sweet and takes the time to tell you what's good, and aways around when you need a refill.Sadly they don't make any old fashions but I settled with a gin and tonic.

She took a photo with the window unicorn and I, even plugging in the lights! We chatted about the Happy Hour rules, and I thought about coming back when it was Happy Hour.I did. However, in changing my watch back/ahead to Happy Hour time, it was ahead by five minutes. Thus when I placed my order, it was 4:58. I was charged $16 by another bartender, don't know her name. I paid, but politely protested, and this chick shrugged her shoulders, and took my $20, giving me no change.Yet Nicole came to my rescue. I told her what had happened, and she honored the 2 for 1 special. So... my take is the local guy/boys/men get the best service. But seek out Nicole and play by the rules. And tip."

Despite the bar not being extremely busy, members of our group stood around the bar for 15 minutes waiting to catch the bartenders attention for a drink. After a while, only 2 of us were able to order a drink. Bartender was extremely rude and commented from across the bar that a tip had not been left on the credit card. Very inappropriate, especially considering my group/table had not yet left the bar, and we would have tipped collectively at the end of our night. As I removed cash from my wallet to tip (as the bartender requested I do immediately), the bartender walked out from behind the bar and practically took the tip out of my hand and said ""thank you"", and returned to behind the bar. Our group decided to take our business elsewhere for the remainder of our night."

The library is a relatively calm oasis amongst a sea of overcrowded clubs and bars with lines halfway down the block. We didn't have to wait to get in and we easily found a seat. The Library definitely has a more low-key atmosphere than most other bars in the neighborhood--its walls are covered in shelves of old books and they were even playing a movie on Saturday night. It has a great vibe if you're more in the mood to talk with friends than to dance in a crowded club. The bouncer was also super friendly which was a plus!"

The breads and cakes looked too heavy at the moment so we ordered halo halo, the quintessential  Filipino summer dessert. Their version came in a large (about Venti Sized) cup for $9. It was made very traditionally with a topping of ice cream, Frosted Flakes on a bed of vanilla shaved ice hiding an inlay of pandan, nato de coco jellies, red bean, and flan cubes. I couldn't really tell what flavor the shaved ice and ice cream were but it tasted similar to pandan. The coconut strips and ube swirl added to the refreshing experience of eating the milky shaved ice with the sweet mix ins. There were so many differnt textures and jellies that each bite remained exciting to the very last. Although I have enjoyed halo halo with ube ice cream, I think this version holds its own.

I heard this was one that sells out quick too. Pork asado buns: 5/5 nice surprise to find an egg in there haha! The pork is savory and it reminds me of pulled pork but not as saucy Avocado shake $4.5 - one of the best, so creamy I definitely am coming back haha, it's such a cozy feeling - very cute cafe interior too, also very popular amongst the locals"

Ube is a purple yam grown in the Philippines and it's delicious. I had a slice of their Ube cake and it was dense and not too sweet.  I also tried their ube pandesal with cheese. It had an interesting taste with the cheese but still yummy because of the ube."

The cafe is a small space along the service road of Queens Blvd near the mall. The space was well organized and brightly lit. Ordered 3 cheese and 3 ube. Wasn't impressed, the filling was scarce and the bread itself felt dense with not much flavor. It looks very nice, especially the purple ube so if you're looking for a dinner roll for a table that stands out then It euros be a good choice."
2459,RRE98DxIdCYZ0msCCDNW4Q,11/14/2021,5 star rating,"Probably the best szechuan food I've had in nyc! I ordered the sliced pork with fresh garlic paste, a twice cooked pork and the chengdu fish (less spicy). One of the biggest problems when I get szechuan food is that the food is just super spicy but has no other flavor. Some restaurants think that just loading peppers in a dish will make it authentic szechuan. I love that even tho a lot of peppers are on the food here, theres still so much flavor in the food thats not just unbearable spice. I love everything we got. Everything I had here was better than the super popular and basic szechusn places in the city. I especially loved the chengdu fish. The soup that the fish is in is thicker than usual which i found to ensure theres a lot of flavor left on the fish. It also came with cabbage, tofu and lots of peanuts that gave everything a nice texture. Will 100% be coming back here soon"

Portions are small and are substituted by a lot of tofu and cabbages. Taste is not good, need more flavor, not feeling thst Szechuan spicy numbness. Not worth trying and the price is expensive for the portion sizes and authentic taste."
2463,RRE98DxIdCYZ0msCCDNW4Q,1/14/2022,4 star rating,"While their Sichuan dishes weren't made the way we most prefer, we love the Sichuan chef's take on Americanized Chinese food. Pedestrian standards like a beef with string bean can be bland, steamed food, or soggy bites in brown sodium sauce.  But the Sichuan touch gives it a flavorful sauce on better-marinated meats and more wok flavor. The only issue we have is that the rice is often delivered Al Dente.  I can handle a little bite to my rice.  My spouse, on the other hand, starts biting. Their Mei Fun is perfectly fried and has that wok-fired taste.  But the vegetables are strangely cut for the dish, and are too wet to be left in the dish.  It comes with more beef than needed. Rather than all these toppings, this dish would be better with long thin slices of carrot and snow pea, maybe an 1/8th of inch thick by 2 inches.  perfect slices.  The beef would be better with less, cut less haphazard and more uniform into similar 1/4 by 2 inch strips. We used to order the mei fun as is, but the large chunks of steamed cabbage damage the finely seared noodles during transit.Eggplant with garlic sauce is nice and middle-of-the-road, being neither too sweet or tangy."
2464,RRE98DxIdCYZ0msCCDNW4Q,11/29/2022,5 star rating,"Grand Sichuan House has continued to get better and better over the 10 or so years we've been fans. It's a lovely, family-run business that really cares. The lady at the front of the house is the hardest working person in the food business - always there, always moving, always gracious. It's the best Chinese restaurant in the area, in my opinion. The cooking is consistently excellent, bold and often surprising. Dishes you may have had and loved before, like DanDan noodles, are head and shoulders above the competition here. Flavors and spicing are not dumbed down here, though they will adjust spice levels if requested. Guizhou Spicy Chicken is probably my favorite dish, a multi-layered flavor bomb with, for some reason, a few french fries thrown in. Not sure where that comes from, but I don't care - it's a spectacular dish. The Guizhou Spicy Beef version is OK, but not at quite the same level as the chicken. Pickled cabbage and shredded pork soup is deceptively simple, yet deeply satisfying; my go-to when I have a cold. The space is simple and comfortable, the service quick but graciousYou. (not the fawning ""yes, sir"" sort, but genuinely kind) Tea and water are refilled quickly, and at the end of the meal you can count on some delicious leftovers   expertly packed to go. Happily, they survived the pandemic and are firing on all cylinders. I love this place."

It looked more like a Chinese takeout than a sit down restaurant. We had the spicy fish pot. It was a huge aluminum pot of soup. It can get intimidated when you see if not because of its size but because it's covered by a blanket of spicy peppers. One will think it's too spicy but the peppers are for flavor. It has a nice kick but not overwhelming (at least not for me). My mom got scared when she saw it but as she was eating it she loved it even though she can't really eat spicy food. The fish is cut very thinly and it has a mixture of vegetables (tofu, cabbage, cucumber, leek, etc). Service was ok."

It's small but cozy and quaint and excellent wine & food selections. Love the dim lighting!! We grabbed a glass of wine and ordered a cheese plate ($19 for 3 cheeses - which were fantastic - and came with yummy toast & a side of jam). Definitely hit the spot for the cheese craving we had and the wine was delish and great pricing. Great service too - our waitress was helpful with cheese selections. Looking forward to returning to order some food - lots of options on the menu.Great date spot for a quick drink - especially if you're heading to The Ribbon down the street after (it's less than 1 block away on 72nd). Not suitable for large groups - essentially all bar tables and bar tops - perhaps could seat 20-25 people in entire bar, at most - but a great neighborhood gem nonetheless!"

Enough that we shifted our seats to allow a few others to join our large high top family style.We met a nice young couple (with their 10 month old) who were regulars.  We tried the smoked blue fish pate and a couple of glasses of Malbec.The flaw I would gig them on is my glass was poured from a bottle which was open ( they poured a taste which was great ) any then they poured my wife 1/2 a glass from that bottle and then open a new bottle to finish her pour.1. Never do this without tasting it2. The difference between the 1st and 2nd bottle was dramatic 3. The glass with the end of the bottle was full of the dregs We did each have a glass from the second one so we weren't too upset but a wine bar should know better.  The difference between good a great is the details"

Bin 71 is a small place, its outdoor seating the major draw in the summertime, indoors is nothing but a bar, no tables at all, which I find odd.I wasn't greeted at the door, had to make eye contact with someone and see if it was ok to sit at one of the tables outside. Was brought a glass of water and had my drink order taken by a waitress, but I guess her shift must have ended because I never saw her again. Someone else took my friend's order and we had to flag someone down to put in a food order. He wasn't too thrilled to give me his opinion when I was trying to decide between two items. I was disappointed that my trout was indeed a smoked trout, must have missed that in the description and it was indeed an appetizer portion. If you're hungry, don't come here because you'll leave hungry. And the menu is limited and has an assortment of weird things that seem to lack a theme or rhyme or reason.Back to the bad service - not once did anyone come by to refill my water. And we had to flag the guy down again to get the check and wait forever for him to come pick up our credit cards. Bin 71 is good only if you want to sit at a cute outdoor place, people watch and have a small bite and a glass of wine."

The large salad is truly huge- more than enough to feed 2 people, and the pita is really good. I didn't really like the hummus which tasted off.

There used to be a really cool Playplace outside for the kiddies, but that has been long gone and replaced with more outdoor seating. The indoor seating has also recently been re-done with new chairs, tables, and booths added to the back section. The seating area is always clean and there's always plenty of tables available. The only McDonalds I can recall having amazing customer service must have been in Kentucky or someplace like that. Otherwise- this location is a grab bag. But I can't imagine having any interaction other than ordering food and receiving said food. The Drive Thru leaves a lot to be desired, so I usually park (in their parking lot with a ton of spaces) and walk in myself. If you've got a craving for McDonalds- this is a great location to visit."

Waited so long by the time my niece got her ice cream it was soup and they wouldn't change it! Cold fries. Cold food. And they didn't supply us with any utensils even though we ordered a salad and ice cream. I had to make several trips to the counter to ask for things and the employee looked like I was bothering her, when herself and the staff obviously messed up the order! If I choose to spend my money in a fast food place the least you can do is make my food how I ask for it!!!! That's why there is a customize button on the kiosk!

As I stood there and waited for the cashier to take my order which turned into a 6 min wait cause she was handling orders coming through over the phone. I watched the Korean woman who was making the food with the same gloves on to come up front and touch every single surface up front. When I watched her do that I proceeded to tell the cashier that was on the phone to ask the Korean lady to change her gloves. Now the Korean woman sees me standing at the front not being assisted by the cashier so she takes it upon herself to take my order with the same gloves on. This woman took my cash and gave me my change with the same gloves and went to the back to continue to proceed to make food. When I seen that of course I made a little scene and asked for my money back. This is how people get sick!!! And it's just sad that everyone was looking at me like if I was wrong for asking for myMoney back. The funny thing is ppl behind on the line still went ahead and ordered food. Lmaoooo They can get E. coli or whatever other disease from this restaurant.

I had the beef and pork tacos but tbh I think they were both beef (which was totally fine). The tacos were good though they were not birria tacos. As good as they were I can't justify buying 2 tacos for $12 so I doubt I'll be ordering again. Additionally, La Lupe is listed as Birria Hands on Uber eats ONLY. There is a no known hard address for ""Birria Hands"". 3 stars due to pricing and Uber eats location."

I also have to add the food isn't even that good, the drinks are solid but the service has never been what it should be. Lastly, I can say my time of walking around the corner to sit and read at La Lupe and okay food is over. I will never go back or recommend the place to anyone again, I'll go elsewhere and get better Mexican food."

Glad I did.My visit here was fairly quick, but here are my thoughts.Options for tacos are plentiful and reasonably priced. I had an al pastor taco and a chorizo taco. The al pastor was just ok, but the chorizo was pretty good. Note that if you get the chorizo taco, it's going to be spicy. I appreciated that considering I really couldn't work out which hot sauce to use. They're all in squeeze bottles in a mini fridge and can help yourself. The problem is that they're not really labeled well. As much as I wanted some hot sauce on my taco, I didn't want to roll the dice and up with Da Bomb.Staff was friendly. Self service water in the back. Good options for spirits. Plenty of good seating. Bathroom has a communal sink.If you're in the area and hungry, I'd recommend stopping in. For sure it's going to be better than some of the fast food options surrounding it."

2556,HsFv6pTnpIGya6Yf5ztn_g,4/30/2020,3 star rating,"This location IS STILL OPEN for delivery. I called to confirm and then I placed an order through Grubhub. The food is very good, however I'm a little upset at what i received at the price i paid. The tacos are great in flavor but you only get 1 tortilla so the taco does not hold together and it falls apart and makes a big mess. That's totally not how I eat my tacos. The corn is super delicious. Here's where my jaw dropped, when I opened the Flautas i found 2 small rolled up taquitos. I couldn't believe I received ONLY 2, with some lettuce and a little guacamole. That is a complete rip off for $9. You mean to tell me I paid $4.50 per taquitos? It is great tasting but totally not worth paying that much. If I would've known it was $9 for 2 I would've just got 2 more tacos. Long story short, don't order Flautas unless you don't have a big appetite because you only get 2 for $9. The tacos only come with 1 tortilla so it'll fall apart into pieces and you'll end up finishing it with a fork. You don't get a Big Bang for your buck here but the food is good."

I really liked the general tsao and rice combo. $6.50 with an egg roll was more than enough food for lunch. The chicken was small, but crunchy which is the way I like it, and not overly sauced. Rice was a bit flavorless.  Adding a soda was only 50 cents.The real star was the scallion pancake. The lunch was bigger than I thought, so I brought them home and toasted them... but they were nice and thick with a lot of scallions.  -1 for no dipping sauce."

Decent side dishes, but some weren't as fresh.. so do take a small bite of them before eating a lot. My friend and I came here because we were craving some Korean broth/stew, and The Kunjip had a decent amount of selections. The portion is a little small compared to the other stores (or was I just more hungry that day..?) and I think it is a little pricey for its value. Still, it's one of the places I would come as my friends and I usually don't have to wait as long to get a spot! Would love to try their meat some time."

I can splurge elsewhere that would treat me nicely.  Now that Ktown is semi-bustling again, with people back in the office and tourists galloping around midtown, I would like to see Ktown back to its glory days and serving up delicious food! I ordered a small portion of fried man-doo... comes in 4, deep fried... it was crispy and tasted good... sadly no dipping sauce? Not sure if they forgot but it's my first time having fried dumplings w/o any complimenting sauce.  Also got my favorite... Yuk-Gae-Jang! The soup flavor was on-point.  Sadly... there's just too much fillers like 65% scallions... and the rest was not substantially satisfying for anyone craving that spicy shredded beef goods... and like a few strands of noodles.  I did like that they served grained rice with it. I was absolutely and completely disappointed with the lack of ban-chans... I was so confused upon seeing what they gave me... no kimchi or radish or sprouts in sight!  I thought. ""Wow... is this for tourists??""... then I saw the couple next to me... upon ordering, their ban-chans were filled with yummy eats such as kimchi, radish, sprouts...! WOW. Guess it sucks to dine solo at Kunjip. lol Never have I ever experienced ""ban-chan"" envy.  All other Korean eats never discriminated against solo diners... needless to say, I'll stick to my usual spots. #supportktown#yelplife#midtowneats"

The food came out pretty quickly - the Bibimbap and soondobu were all pretty good, but nothing special compared to other Korean establishments in the area. They refilled the banchan mostly unprompted, and water bottles as well. Overall, pleasurable experience and would absolutely return when it is (hopefully) less busy."

2577,v7hwkFxrz2pORrT9Fiiovw,1/14/2023,1 star rating,Been here many times with no issue. Made a reservation and arrived on time today. Was told to go upstairs and I waited around standing there for 5 min and no one seated me. I even tried asking one of the bus boys to get help and he just shrugged and walked away from me before I could finish my sentence. Finally one of the Korean staff looked at me and then proceeded to seat the Korean group that arrived AFTER me. I asked what was going on and they told me to sit down while they seated another Korean group. I'm not Korean and I wonder if that has anything to do with me not being served. I'm never coming here again. Never.

I am absolutely obsessed with their massaman curry, it's one of the best things I've ever eaten and I get it at least once a week. I've had their fried rice, pineapple fried rice, curry puffs, beer battered short ribs, vegetable rolls, and calamari. All of it is 10/10 and I will continue to only order Thai food from them.

I took it back and explained to the young man (who never gets my order right) that it was not spicy. What does he do, he goes in the back and just mixes in some nasty chili paste all sloppy looking and hands it back to me. Whenever I go in there to place an order and the young lady is there she always gets the order right and she is very pleasant and polite. The guy (MORON!!) he never takes the order properly!!! Complete IDIOT!!!"

Highly recommend the crispy duck rolls ($6 for 3) as they were pretty generously filled with juicy duck and they were perfectly crispy. The pad thai ($10) was great, and came with a huge portion for the value. The red curry ($10) was tasty, but was so full of bamboo shoots that there was more bamboo than curry. Overall, great prices and I've never had delivery come this quickly!"

The crispy duck over pineapple fried rice and basil dish with beef and white rice are all I ever order from here and over the past 6 months, I've only had 1 dish that wasn't up to the standard. They are easily forgiven for that for being my favourite Thai restaurant in this part of Brooklyn. The food is always hot when delivered and the employees are courteous. This is my comfort food place in the neighborhood because the flavours make me contented after my meal."

I've really loved everything I've tried. Personal favorites are the fried tofu (so fresh!) and anything with pineapple and cashew, of which there are ample choices. I just tried the steamed dumplings and they were also A++ Some examples of the great service here: My boyfriend gets very sick from gluten and everyone I've interacted with from GT has been really clear when I've asked about ingredients and requested small substitutions, which is not the case everywhere. I especially appreciate their patience with me after I tried to order food with a bad migraine and got my own address wrong... -_- Thank you Golden Thai!"

On my way home I missed my turn for my fav local Spanish spot and saw the bright lights of a GOLDEN THAI on the corner of Jefferson & Irving. Thank you dear Jesus for redirecting my path!!! I'm so excited to have a new place to eat that's CLOSE and that's GOOD! I popped into this cute little quaint spot and got myself some Thai fried rice with shrimp. It took about 10 minutes for my order to be made. Got home and opened it. I was pleasantly surprised by the portion and even more surprised by the FLAVOR! So so soooooo so YUMMY! I will be back for more soon and very soon!!

I ordered the basil stir fry extra spicy with tofu, added carrots, and sub brown rice. I will say for the added cost of subbing brown rice, I expected it to come with a lot more. However, the flavor was great and they really did amp up the spice for me. I will definitely be adding this to my list for a quick pick up."

From the looks of it, the store retains a lot of loyal regulars, and I can see why given the welcoming and friendly service.  The L1, the typical Special Rice Noodle Soup with Beef ($11.95), was on the salty side, if that's your preference. But other than that, it was a solid pho. Their Beef Eye Round was really tender and soft! And they sure gave plenty of it! The LBC1 Bun Combo 1, which was a Rice Vermicelli ($15.75), shook me with how delicious it was. We usually order pho, so this was the change up we needed. The beef was tightly wrapped and was kind of burnt in an almost un-edible way unfortunately, BUT everything else though. This dish was a nice way to sample the deliciously crispy spring rolls, and say what? A taro cake?

While eating dinner here on 2/19/2022, an 18 year old was having a birthday dinner here and the owners plated up a dessert that they brought and then started a birthday song on their sound system. I've never actually seen an entire restaurant voluntarily join in to celebrating a stranger's birthday. It was really fun. I had the L1 pho and my husband had the L12 pork chop and it was a nice meal in Manhattan Chinatown."

The prices have gone up over the years, so you will pay slightly more, but it's reasonable.  Oh and get their chicken curry pho when feeling under the weather."

It's usually very busy but they do a great job of preparing the drinks quickly. My favorites are the Kung fu tea, taro, and the new addition of Thai tea. If you don't like very sweet drinks, makes sure to tell them to add less sugar as they typically add a lot. Make sure to download their app for rewards !"

She said with an attitude "" I will not be changing it for you every day and I don't even recognize your name"". There are right ways to approach it and the there are wrong ways. Any other coffee or tea shop would gladly change it for you especially for a one time mistake.

Well in this case, it must've been a FRAUDULENT PROMOTION. Tried to claim the free drink as a new app user. The workers said to buy the drink first then it would deduct on its own. So bought the drink and they said it charged the credit card. Asked about the deduction and they said there's none.Got SCAMMED into downloading a new app and paid for a drink otherwise wouldn't have gotten. Made a detour for this too."
2634,ki9q3O-qk1YE-e2Uw1b5tA,8/6/2017,3 star rating,I visited this place often when I was younger. I stopped by today and they had redone the layout. There's more space for customers to stand while waiting for a drink. I got the pudding milk tea with half sugar and half ice. My total was $3.81 since the pudding is a $.50 up charge. While waiting for the drink I noticed the front area hadn't been cleaned in a while. The drink was okay. The milk tasted different than what I was used to. There was a really big portion of pudding which I cannot complain about. I probably won't come back for another drink though. Feels like the recipe has changed.

It was absolutely disgusting, leaving me in utter disbelief. The last time I walked in here was when they first opened a couple years ago and at that time the store was much nicer. I believe they had a larger counter and you can see them making your drinks right in front of you. Now.. The counter is squished all the way in the corner of the room, completely blocking off what is going on in the back when they're making your drinks.. They can literally do whatever they want back there. The other corner for a huge useless garbage can and another corner for merch. Like no one will buy your merch COME ON. The girl that took my order was very condescending. If someone orders the wrong thing maybe it is your JOB to help them and not CORRECT them like they're some stupid idiot. Finished ordering my drink and THIS PLACE DOES NOT TAKE CREDIT CARD. How do you have a QR scanner but not take credit card. Are you still in the 1900s?!!!! She gave me the receipt with a number on it.. and naturally i just threw it away. I mean theres two people in the shop if you can't remember what these two people ordered maybe you really should not be working here. She calls the number.. and i clearly see that it's my drink. I walk up to her and ask her if those were mine and she acts like she's never seen me before... DEAR LORD i just ordered from you like 5 minutes ago. WAKE UP?!! I will not be coming back here. Please take some time to properly train your incompetent staff."

I told her I did empty the bag and there is nothing else in there, she said I'll just refund you the dressing. I told her please refund me the salad and I would send it back. She rudely said she couldn't and hung up. People like this shouldn't be working, especially not during a pandemic such as what we are going through. She should be thankful she has a job and she should do it well. Sorry excuse for a worker. Soho should shut down."

Last week I ordered pea soup, got beef stew.  Just ordered chicken breast platter that was supposed to come with fries, greek salad and pita bread.  I received chicken on lettuce and peppers.  My friend recently ordered a chicken salad sandwich.  The menu says white meat chicken, not one piece of white meat on the whole sandwich.  Straight in the garbage it went.  So sorry to have to have leave this review.  This is certainly the last time I order from here."

I asked for grilled chicken on top and if it could be warmed. The lady at the counter said it could be warmed up but I still got cold, rubbery chicken bits instead. Service is very non-chalant. I think the breakfast here might be better than lunch or dinner options, but I'll probably stay away unless they make some serious changes to the quality of their food."

I came with my friend for Restaurant Week and had an amazing time. We started off with Salmone with beets. I loved it. We split the Risotto and Tagliatelle. Both were delicious, but I'm definitely coming back for the Risotto. Next, we had chicken and fish. It was also really good. For dessert, we had the Cioccolato, Tiramisu, and yogurt with sorbet.The service here was impeccable. Everything was on point. No empty water glasses, clean silverware for each course, and I really didn't have to ask for anything--even directions to the bathroom. Michael saw me looking around and before I could ask, he already assisted me. My napkin was folded each time. I just have to say it feels good to be back and feel this in NYC. Michael did a phenomenal job at giving us a great first experience at Armani Ristorante. It was such a great experience overall."

The food is light and flavorful, the service is impeccable, lovely set of choice wines, and a beautiful intimate setting...who can ask for more? The salmon tartare was extremely fresh, and the accompanying sauce was light. The pasta was cooked to the perfect texture, and the Ragu sauce  was a perfect compliment. I paired my meal with Brunelllo wine (my favorite!) and capped my meal with their tiramisu. Their tiramisu was also light (thankfully) and had the perfect espresso to mascarpone ratio. I highly recommend, as I know I will be back."
2653,KReqHbkgAb5_FhGAK7HDyA,6/14/2021,5 star rating,"I knew Armani as a place to purchase high quality, couture clothing; I had no idea it is also a place to enjoy a high quality, couture culinary experience! The fashion forward, opulent interior was no surprise given the Armanni name. Not only is the stairwell leading from the shopping floors below to the restaurant above a spectacle of modern art, the flatware and glasses are equally upscale and beautiful. The food is also an artful masterpiece. We dive in with a refreshing pallet cleanser starring hamachi crudo and fresh, sweet watermelon. It's paired with what I'd have to describe as a pork rind/chicharon dusted with a sweet and spicy red chili. So they basically combined fat, spice and sweet with a satisfying crunch...ie high addiction level here, eater beware! The table bread consists of crispy, flat bread wafers baked to perfection with toasted parmesan cheese and garlic. Do your best not fill up on it; it'll be hard, but you can do it.The steak tartare is a vision, reminiscent of a beautiful floral arrangement with its bold and bright hues. Adorned in colorful radishes, beets, onions and a generous portion of truffle flakes, it is as delicious as it is dazzling.Next the pasta dish. Admittedly, expectations were high. I figured if I was going to stray from my normally pasta-averse diet, an Italian restaurant where the executive chef was previously recruited by Italy's formula one racing team as Chef de Cuisine and whose stints at other European restaurants resulted in ""Best Italian Restaurant"" awards in each of their respective countries, is probably a good place for a pasta cheat day. And I was right! The pasta dish, comprised of housemaid fresh spinach taglioni with tender, flavorful langoustines, meaty and buttery wild mushrooms, and seasonal truffles was phenomenal. This is how pasta is done.As an aside, I was most impressed with the customer service as both my dinner date and I initially failed to note that the pasta dish included langoustine which he is unable to eat. Once it was pointed out, the wait staff promptly and quickly replaced his pasta dish with another equally delicious option that fit his dietary restrictions. No fuss no muss.More deliciousness ensued with the meat course. The veal cheek was thick, yet tender, with a sizeable portion of fat providing additional succulent flavor. The tomato-based vinegar sauce was tart and a great contrast to the savoriness of the meat.Finally, for dessert I enjoyed a variety of artisanal cheeses with assorted preserves, complementary macaroons, and a dessert pastry that was similar to a funnel cake. Appropriate, since my taste buds had just enjoyed a carnival of fun flavors. Next time you're treating yourself to some retail therapy on 5th ave, continue pampering yourself and visit Armani/Ristorante"
2654,KReqHbkgAb5_FhGAK7HDyA,6/10/2021,5 star rating,"Omg I absolutely love this restuarant. This restuarant usually participates in restaurant week but unfortunately I never made it there. In the meantime I am in my tasting menu phase and I came across the Giorgio Armani tasting menu, which is 7 course meal for $135 per person. It was definitely a splurge but so worth it for the taste and experience. I went inside Giorgio Armani store to hop on the elevator to get into the restaurant on the 3rd Floor. What I learned at the end of the night as I was leaving is that the restaurant had its own street entrance. I arrived at around 6pm there were very few local diners so I get to enjoy the amazing ambiance while feeling like a regular. However prior to being seated the hostess checked my temperature and had to complete an electronic contact tracing form. When I was seated I had the perfect view of 5th Avenue from the 3rd floor. The menu was served in a tablet. I loved the table set up and I was constantly thirsty so I kept drinking water the whole time. I must say that if you're doing this tasting menu be prepared for a three hour course meal experience. The service overall was amazing there about 5 people constantly pouring water when it was half full, scraping off the crumbs and changing utensils for every dish served. Dennis the waiter was amazing and very knowledgeable. He is originally from Italy and he was my curator throughout my meal experience up until 7pm-7:30pm when the restaurant started getting busy.Now to the food:The chef served two free appetizers for their summer menu which changes every two days.1) Zucchini Tarragon and Italian Parmesan tart. The tart was made from rice flour. It was light and it was a perfect bite. 2) Custard with fish eggs and truffle - this dish was ok definitely a sample of a luxury appetizer. Now to the seven course tasting menu:First dish: LATTUGA E PISTACCHIOBaby lettuce salad dressed with white balsamic vinegar, Sicilian candied pistachio foam, matcha powder and yogurt powder. First impression: love the dressing and the salad tasted good when you combine all the components to the baby lettuce. Second dish: VITELLO TONNATOVeal tonnato with Pantelleria caper leaves and homemade vegetable giardiniera. The veal is braised and served separately from the homemade pickled vegetables. This dish was interesting and to really appreciate the dish you have to take the pickled vegetable and wrap it with the veal to get that perfect food balance. What I did was I ate the veal first then chased the aftertaste down with the pickled vegetables. Ultimately when you combine the two it is the perfect bite. Third dish: POLPOGrilled octopus with fermented blueberries served with a purple corn cannolo filled with mantecato. This dish was also served separately. The octopus was cooked to perfection but it had an interesting taste with the fermented blueberries. The corn cannoli is filled with octopus blended in olive oil, that was also interesting. Definitely a dish I never had, probably my least favorite yet the taste of it is  memorable. Fourth dish: TORTELLITortelli filled with buffala milk robiola,fresh green pea puree and black seasonal truffle.  This dish was to die for, I have no words but I would eat this dish again if it's available a la carte. Fifth dish: RISOTTOCarnaroli Riserva ""San Massimo"" Armani Milano with safron and Parmigiano fondue. Another amazing dish, very rich in cheese but deceivingly filling. Definitely worth trying a la carte. Sixth dish: MANZO35-day dry aged angus served with confit potatoes and oven roasted mushroom. Since I was getting really full from the two amazing previous dishes, I didn't enjoy this dish as much as I would have liked. The meat was cooked Medium and I had to force myself to finish the 3oz serving. I loved the confit potato, grilled scallion and picked rhubarb. I wasn't thrilled by the mushroom. I would have the dish more if I was more hungry.  There was a break between the sixth and seventh dish because I needed to digest all the savory ingredients I ingested.  So for the pre dessert the chef served a coconut sorbet with homemade strawberry fruit roll up. This dish was very refreshing especially after eating the savory dish. Seventh dish: MELA VERDERobiola and goat cheese mousse, cake topped with green apple sorbet. This dish hit the spot to end my night. The mousse blended perfectly with the green apple. The sorbet with the cake tasted awesome. I devour this dish. Definitely worth ordering a la carte. On top of the food listed above, there was complementary fresh baked sourdough bread which I will reheat plus breadsticks and cheese crisps. In addition, the were petite fours but was too full to consume I took it to go. Favorite dishes: tortelli, risotto and mela verde. If you able to splurge or treat yourself with a tasting you should check this place out! Dennis was an amazing waiter and food curator."

We ordered a la carte and enjoyed the incredible service: warm hand towel at the beginning, helpful tips, delicious selection of breads with an amazing herb butter and olive oil, the palate cleansers served between every meal, the gorgeous bathroom. My entree (the spinach tagliolini with langoustines, wild mushroom, and seasonal truffle) was PHENOMENAL. Every bite I took left me wanting more. It was beautifully rich without being TOO rich. Each dish was an art just to look at (and photograph, of course). We enjoyed the tiramisu dessert, just wished there was more. Overall, definitely a pricy meal, but worth the price tag!"

What I would do, is: 1. Drag your offspring to meet up with some close friends you haven't seen since pre-pandemic times in the somewhat charming, somewhat ramshackle outdoor dining area Shanghai Heping has erected, and...2. Order entirely too much food and beer.If you need suggestions on food:Get all the soup dumplings (at least two more orders than you think you need), all the noodles, the boneless crispy duck if you want to get weird with it, and the Spicy General Chicken (for some reason they don't want to give Tso his due). One of your friends may pretend not to want the latter because it's sweet and inauthentic, and if he really insists then don't let him have any of the deliciousness. It's the most popular dish in America for a reason."

The food was great, service was pretty quick, staff was friendly and helpful as best as they could be. The soup dumplings hit the spot. I wanted to get another order or two but was too full! Yummy walnut shrimp and bok choy as well! I would like to try more of their menu.Only issue was trying to find food options for my celiac wife. We knew it would be iffy of whether anything would be safe for her to eat, and it's fine when a place can't provide those options. It happens all the time. But the trouble here was that no one understood what gluten was, talking about wheat didn't help either, and we just had to assume the whole menu either had soy sauce or wheat thickeners or contamination.Again, we did anticipate this, but hoped the staff might understand or be able to communicate allergy info at least. It's all good though! We got her some food nearby afterwards."

It's been a long while since I had some (non-Trader Joe's) soup dumplings. I didn't have a specific Shanghainese place in mind. I just searched for options nearby and this was the first one I came across while walking. They had both indoor and outdoor dining which was great. I ordered regular soup dumplings and Shanghai style stir fried rice cake. Soup dumplings were great. Rice cake was probably the best I've ever had. It's a dish that I like, but am not crazy about. I enjoyed it more than I ever had from here. Service was ok, maybe a bit awkward. Anyway, definitely recommend if you're craving some Shanghainese food in the area."

2706,z6HMM_cSraJFkQFvSjWGDA,8/5/2019,3 star rating,"OK Shanghainese food. There were definitely some hits and misses during our meal.My wife and I came here for an early Friday evening dinner at around 6pm and the restaurant was pretty empty. It was early after all, so there was nothing surprising about that. With the amount of space they have and the number of Shanghainese restaurants in the area, I'm doubtful that the restaurant gets really crowded. Plus, tourists tend to flock to the restaurants south of Canal Street instead of north.The menu was like your average Shanghainese restaurant menu - Shanghainese appetizers, cold dishes, seafood and meat entrees, rice cake entrees, vegetable dishes and noodles. And there were plenty of options in each category. Since everything is practically the same here as it is at most Shanghainese restaurants, we pretty much ordered what we normally order to compare it:SMOKED VEGETARIAN MOCK DUCK- One of our typical cold appetizers to kick start our Shanghainese meals. We weren't big fans of the way they made it here because it was too smoky. The top of the mock duck was burnt and the smokiness of it overwhelmed the flavor of the mock duck. On the plus side, the serving size was above average, but it might have been attributed to the fact that it was cut into smaller pieces, so it felt like the order was bigger than it is.KAU FU- The other typical cold dish we start with. Like the mock duck, we were disappointed in this. First, it was a bit on the warm side for a cold dish. Second, the Kau Fu was too dry, which resulted in a lack of flavor.CRISPY PAN FRIED NOODLE (SHANGHAI STYLE - shrimp, chicken, pork and vegetables)- I have to admit, this felt like a guilty pleasure because it was so ""saucy"", perfectly pan fried and 100% unhealthy ....  but it was so damn good. To be honest, we ordered this by mistake, thinking that it was the thicker Shanghainese pan fried noodle, but nevertheless we were glad it was a case of mistaken identity. The noodles were extra crispy and just enough of the thick beef sauce covered the noodle so that it didn't collapse out of sogginess. There was plenty of the main ingredients as well, so it was very well balanced.  Let's just say it was one of the best mistakes I had made in a long time.STEAMED SOUP DUMPLING WITH PORK & CRAB MEAT- There were 8 pieces in the order and it was good. My wife actually liked the soup dumplings here over many of the previous Shanghainese restaurants that we had been to lately, so they did something right. The skin was a bit thick, but there was plenty of soup in each dumpling and the pork was flavorful. It didn't hurt that they gave us a ton of vinegar, so I put all it good use.From a service perspective, everything came out very quick, which was a little concerning and pretty much verified to us that it was mostly prepped ahead of time. Even the pan fried noodle came out unusually quick, but it was still good. The only dish that took some time was the soup dumplings. Shanghai Heping was OK. It's as no-frills as it gets and pretty much your average Chinatown Shanghainese restaurant."

Looked for the email and found it [didnt respond to the email] she then went on to tell me it is easier to just order online.... okay We went online. And my boyfriend wasn't comfortable so he went IN PERSON to order the cake. You would think if you go in person, talk to someone, there is no way to fudge the pooch-- wrong! After showing them a whole picture. [although they had it in the email] They messed up the cake sooooo bad. It's like they didn't even check for quality before they let it leave the store. The number 12 was bigger than the cake itself. NOOO decorations just one symbol on the cake. It was like a horror situation of what I asked for VS what I got. I did call and express my concerns and frustration. They then allowed us to bring the cake it to be fixed. The fix was doable. But you spend 200$ on a cake. You shouldn't have to go behind them and tell them how to do their job. Cake tasted good. I give them that. Red velvet. One star for taste"

2711,z6HMM_cSraJFkQFvSjWGDA,11/26/2021,1 star rating,"I ordered a cake to pick  up for my daughters birthday. On Tuesday Nov 23 2021, I went to pick up a cake for my daughters birthday dinner. On the way there, and prior to arriving I was calling BCakeNy for 20 minutes, and I received no answer. The phone just kept ringing and then went to voice mail and at first I decided not to panic because I was on the way there anyways and according their website hours they were open and it was possible that they were busy fulfilling other orders. Once I arrived at BCakeNY things took a turn for the worst. As I walked up to the door I realized that no one was in the store. I stood outside in the cold for 20 minutes  anxiously waiting  for someone to come to the door and assist me , their paying customer. As I waited I called for at least 10 minutes and got no one on the phone. At this point my anxiety is through the roof, I am running very late and very low on time to take my daughter to  her birthday dinner reservation due to me waiting on them and I am freezing. It was extremely disheartening to be left in the cold as I waited on the employees to finally arrive (after leaving a staff thanksgiving dinner a couple doors down) and accommodate me by providing me with the cake that I paid for and that THEY KNEW I WAS COMING TO PICK UP ON NOV 23 2021. 20 minutes after me waiting in the freezing cold, 5 of the employees later came strolling down towards the  BCakeNY store to then  sarcastically tell me that they were sorry for being late due to them being at a thanksgiving staff dinner.This was just the beginning. Not only was I waiting in the cold for the cake I paid for, but I didn't even receive the actual cake I wanted and paid for!! The top half design of the cake was missing causing the cake to look bare and plain and as though it was designed by a amateur. As a parent not only did my heart break, but also as a great customer I felt as though this company did not support me at all. The company was very sarcastic with their apology and later offered me  $46 gift certificate which doesn't even begin to compensate for the way I was treated as customer by an established company. It seems as though this company does not feel the need to give proper customer service to clientele that aren't celebrities being that celebrity clientele is where they obtain their worth as a company. BCakeNy gives celebrities luxurious complementary cakes to build their establishment and as a result they feel as though because they've obtained some sort of credit that they don't need to treat their everyday customers with proper care or service.  The location I've had this terrible experience with is at 702 Washington Avenue. Brooklyn, NY 11238.  After speaking with employee, Justine, on the phone who claimed she was going to reach out to the managers Donna and Kate in regards to this mishap,  neither of the managers reached out to me with an apology for the cake. They simply sent a email with the gift certificate of $46. This is despicable and I do no recommend this company to anyone in hopes of finding good cake along with good customer service. A waste of money and a waste time.*Attached is a picture of the cake. On the left is the cake I ordered and on the right is the cake I received."

I've followed BCakeNY Social media handles for years and saw how people raved about their cakes. I also was excited to see that they had a shop in BK and even better within walking distance to my parent's house. I also noticed that in addition to cakes, one can purchase cupcakes, cake jars and some of the cake jars are also spiked with alcohol. So I decided to walk to the shop and try the red velvet cake jar. The shop is on the tiny side and allows for only one customer at a time which I'm extremely grateful for since we are it's been a year since we are in a pandemic. They were very efficient so I didn't have to wait too long outside. As soon as I walked in, they greeted me at the door. Although they seemed extremely busy, they had a nice system which I could appreciate. I think I saw about 4 cakes leave the shop in the 10 minutes that I was there as it was Valentine's Day weekend. Fast forward to me at my hotel and I'm biting into this red velvet cake jar....Absolutely divine. Extremely moist and the icing was super buttery. I look forward to partnering with them at my next birthday event for sure."

So I was super excited to go in to get a new cake made for her. I normally go in because I am visually impaired and doing it online is a bit difficult and I also enjoy sitting with them to get her cake all squared away. I have been to the location before the pandemic and during so I understand the concern for personal distance and personal safety.  When I arrived to the location I was excited to design the cake and to sit with someone to get it done. Walking in I was greeted by a young lady who was sitting down doing some paperwork. I told her I wanted to design a cake for my daughter's 3rd birthday, told her the date and she began to point at the cakes behind her on display. I explained that I did not see very well and if I could get closer, she hesitated, and told me we really doing want people to come to far inside of the shop. I understand and still explained that I did not see very well and if someone could help me. (I understand that Bcakes has display books but I didn't not see them out nor was I offered one.)  She then suggested that I could do it online for a set price. It was not about the price, it was about the customer service that I required to complete my order.  I live in the Bronx, I purposefully came to Brooklyn to design a cake and to get some treats.  I also came for the personal service that I have received in the past. I asked again for assistance and she asked a young lady from behind the counter to assist me. What bothered me was not just this exchange; but that they didn't suggest a tasting. I understand if there was a fee that's fine, but how do you choose a flavor you want without trying them. Even if we were able to take it home and call in to modify the invoice. It was suggested that I purchase a cupcake... I'd rather the tasting instead but I felt as though I was a bother this whole time so I didn't want to push. When she came to me to assist me I had some more question and the original lady decided she would sidebar and answer my question all by doing her paperwork and no looking at us. Meanwhile that was no where to sit inside all the seats were occupied by staff on laptops. The young lady and I stood up and worked from my phone. I finally took it upon myself to walk over to the display window to see what I want.  The young lady who assisted me was very helpful in understand that I did not see very well and she inputted the information on my phone from their website. Overall the experience with the youg lady from behind the counter went well. Moreover, the owner walked passed me twice and did acknowledge me or other customers but spoke with her staff. She has done this before.  The last time I was there I had to stop her to say hello to her after she passed me three times. During this occasions, however, I was more taken aback by the fact that her staff was more interested with getting me out of the shop and not assisting me than anything else.  I absolutely love the cakes that are prepared there; they look and taste amazing. I am disappointment at the customer service I received. I hope that they can do better. We love the cakes and we love designing them with the staff its unfortunate that they were lackluster about it."

2722,n1elkLPlnQX_PArLvuVVIg,8/17/2014,4 star rating,"Food here is pretty darn yummy to me. Today, my order of chicken and shrimp with yellow rice tasted really fresh and clean. My small order was rather large and served to me piping hot. My shrimps were pink and crud free. Not usually a fan of dark meat but Yummy Taco makes me happy to take a ride to the dark side. Wish we had a Yummy Taco or any type of tasty Tex-Mex takeout on the Fulton/Nostrand side of town. Good food, dirt cheap. I can dig it."
2723,n1elkLPlnQX_PArLvuVVIg,11/18/2011,3 star rating,"Alright, all these previous terrible reviews must have their taste buds in a twist. This is the only place you can get a grill taste off the steak/chicken. I have to admit their tortillas can be a bit chewy and thick but for the price and portion size this place is good. Good: Awesome grill taste, big portion sizes, good prices, fresh sour creamBad: Chewy tortillas, long lines and slow service, and the cashier kind of yells at you. 'WHAT KINDA SODAHH?!'"
2724,n1elkLPlnQX_PArLvuVVIg,5/18/2019,1 star rating,The worst customer service...I went there on lunch break...i ordered a tostada salad with shrimp as i dont eat meat so being that i only had a few mins left on break...instead he gave me chicken...i called the store to get the right order delivered and told him he can have the incorrect order back but he's going to tell me he  had too many customers to remember who I am...I told him I had a receipt but it was left in the store I also told him I was there 5 mins ago if that and have him a full description of myself ...in which he responded he gets 300 to 400 customers so he can't remember...keep in mind I told him what he and his other female worker in the store was wearing and in the 5 mins that I was there he only had 1 customer...so in 5 mins you cannot tell me it was so busy that you can not remember who I was...no more service from me

It was disgusting, chicken was dry and bland. The sauce was watery and didn't cling to the chicken. It was not worth the price. That's what I get for being inpatient and not waiting in line at my regular place. Stay away from this place."
2726,n1elkLPlnQX_PArLvuVVIg,4/17/2012,3 star rating,"Cheap ""Mexican"" food cooked by people who are definitely not Latino in any sense of the term (I'm going to go with Asian... specifically Chinese...).That being said, I can get two grilled chicken fajita entrees delivered hot to my door for $20 with tip in under 20 minutes! Now that is freaking amazing. The serving portions are pretty decent too. I always save half for leftovers the next day. Is it the best food ever? No. Is it satisfying? Yes.Notes: Make your own guac since theirs is awful. Oh and use your own hot sauce. If you really want to be a freak like me, use nonfat Greek yogurt instead of their sour cream and swap out the white tortillas for whole wheat ones at home. Ta da, a somewhat healthy dinner in a hurry when you have no energy/time to cook!"

2729,0iQn4DlREs7ma8OQxnU_1w,10/4/2022,2 star rating,"The inside of this place is decently-sized, so it would be good for larger groups. It was pretty empty on a Tuesday night, and I can definitely see why, despite it being in a nice location. The service was fast and friendly though. There's a happy hour until 7 pm, and we got a pitcher of Sangria for $19. The sangria was not particularly tasty, but I can't tell if it was from the wine or the fruit. A pitcher is definitely more than enough for 2 people though. The setting is cute though, with a candle-lit table. Pad Thai w/ Chicken ($13) - This was super dry and lacked any flavor. There were definitely too many noodles and not enough sauce. The portion size was massive though and had plenty of chicken.  Red Curry w/ Pork ($15) - This also lacked a lot of flavors. We asked for it extra spicy and it was anything but that. Again, the pork was pretty good but everything else was disappointing flavor-wise. The portion size was pretty big but there was not enough rice to go with the curry."

My friend got pad see ew which was also fine but not super memorable. Loved the drinks though, Sapporo for $3. But, I wish it was colder!! Staff were more friendly after we ordered but they were a little unapproachable when we were asking about wait times and availability. To be honest, it's not a place I'll travel for but if I'm in the area I'd try a different dish."

I was going to pay the waiter a dollar for every beer and $2 for cocktail.. but if the management wants to be sneaky like this and pay staff less money.. that's not my problem. they get 2 stars because the service was fast.
2732,0iQn4DlREs7ma8OQxnU_1w,3/20/2023,4 star rating,"I was short on time for lunch and I figured I'd be able to get some good thai in NYC. This place was a few blocks away from my hotel and had some pretty good reviews. I ventured over, but I couldn't find the entrance. The restaurant is next to the dumpling place, you can see the signs for the restaurant, but no signs for where the entrance is. So, for those who plan on visiting, the entrance is to the right of a stair case that goes up. There are 2-3 steps down that lead to the entrance. Anyway, like many places, I preview the menu so I don't waste too much time. And with most thai places I go to, I usually get the massaman curry. This was no different. But, I didnt realize they offered a lunch portion, on a Sunday. I got it with crab rangoons, as an appetizer was complimentary. These were lunch portions, as well. 2 round rangoons, which were fine. Don't let the yellow interior color throw you off. They were pretty good, along with the chili sauce they were in. The massaman was interesting. A different flavor than most massamans I have had. This one seemed to be on the sweeter side, almost tasting like nutmeg. It threw me off for a minute, but the taste grew on me. It was pretty good. And the portion was the perfect size. The entree also came with a free soup or salad, but I declined, even though it was free. And an even better part? This meal cost me $13, plus tip. Not a bad deal for NYC.."

Both were super good, but I saw that their lunch special was $12. Also, atmosphere is dark and romantic which is super super good. The service was very efficient and really good. I would come back again to try other items."
2735,0iQn4DlREs7ma8OQxnU_1w,8/16/2022,3 star rating,"Decent food, good for groups and pre night-out.Food (4/5) - I ordered a special that night (it's no longer on the menu now). It was a fried rice dish with mangoes, shrimp paste and grilled chicken. Was pretty enjoyable. I really like shrimp paste and this did not disappoint.Perhaps I was expecting a spicier dish but would've preferred if there was more spice and perhaps even shrimp paste in the dish.Price (3/5) - For St Marks this was a little steep, closer to $20 and for a slightly smaller sized portion than I'm used to. Drinks seemed a little more reasonable than usual, however.Service (4/5) - Prompt. Not too overbearing either.Ambiance (1/5) - Wayyyy too loud (both music and acoustics). Had to shout to hear my friend across the table, and we were already sat near the entrance / away from the speakers. By the time we left, it felt like we had just been in a club / bar of some sort. This was also a weeknight. It was also pretty dark inside, so I had a bit of trouble reading the menu."
2736,0iQn4DlREs7ma8OQxnU_1w,7/29/2022,5 star rating,"As a part of an incredible $12 lunch deal, this dumpling and salad was provided as complements to the main pad thai. Steamed Dumpling (B) - The steamed dumpling is incredibly flavorful, with the balance of fish sauce, palm sugar, and tamarind mixed with herbs to create a harmonious balance of thai flavors. Unfortunately though, the actual dumpling is dry inside.House Salad (B) The house salad is driven by a sumptuous peanut sauce, which emphasizes authentic flavors. Besides the peanut sauce though, I found the salad to be a bit mundane and the tofu to be weirdly cold.Pad Thai (A) - Another Pad Thai from a Southeast Asian restaurant on my account lol! this Pad Thai was impressive as it had a lot of pork that was cooked tenderly, and flavored well to have the sweet, salty, and sour balance, while being plated rematively well. The restaurant interior also looks really nice, but the exterior is wet and undersirable."

We got the chicken satay, calamari, taro spring rolls, tofu pad thai, and shrimp green curry. It came out really fast, but kind of suspiciously fast and it was somewhat lukewarm/cold. I wished the tofu was crispier or something but it was really just large, unflavored tofu chunks. The flavor on everything was also a little bit lacking in my opinion, but we liked the taro spring rolls the best out of everything. We also got a lychee mojito pitcher and it was really good!! The aesthetics of the place were really nice and I think I would come back for drinks, but maybe not for food. Another side note is that I was not a fan of the frosted glass doors on the bathroom, it's mildly uncomfortable."

I will not be eating here again. The service was horrible."
