We started with the omakase which was honestly very disappointing. The sushi was very tiny and the fish they served was nothing special. It was very fresh but as a chef's choice course it seemed very ordinary. A few of the pieces actually tasted pretty awful... the scallop with smoked sea salt was the worst and left a very bitter after taste in my mouth. The chopped mackerel with sesame and ginger was also a really weird combination and left a very unpleasant taste in my mouth. Everything else was OK and not memorable. On the other hand the cooked dishes were phenomenal! The grilled octopus was melt in your mouth and cooked to perfection. The oxtail pappardelle was really amazing. Loved the fresh pasta and the mushrooms paired with the oxtail ragu. The milk and honey ice cream was really awesome but the sesame parfait was a miss for me since the sesame ice cream was way too strong.Beware that portion sizes are incredibly small here!  Overall a really nice restaurant for a nice date and I would come back but only for the cooked items."
1,MM5P9cKlzovYLcf5qf2SwQ,7/30/2018,4 star rating,"Though I love sushi, I've never been much of a sushi snob... I'll even eat the pre-packaged stuff sometimes (don't @ me). But I have to admit it's a lovely treat to enjoy the high quality stuff once in a while, especially in the creative and unique way that 1 or 8 does it. Though I didn't take part in the omakase, my dining partner and I still got a VERY full meal thanks to the many small dishes we ordered to share. We got the karaage, shishito peppers, kale and seaweed salad, grilled squid, the yellowtalk temaki (which comes with ingredients to make two hand rolls), and a spicy tuna roll. Oh and some rosé of course. If that sounds like a lot for two people, it was, but we demolished it all. Oh yeah, and the sesame parfait for dessert. Out of all of those dishes, my favorites were the kale and seaweed salad (which I thought seemed overpriced on the menu but it's so delightful and a very large portion) and the sushi items. I love the temaki and the cute way it's presented, with those little discs of rice. Eeep! Makes me think that if I return, I'll definitely want to do the omakase as the sushi is really where it's at here. As for the ambiance, it's so much larger than I thought it was going to be on the interior, with a modern white ambiance and open space. It was super quiet and chill on a Friday evening, with some families and couples on dates. The service was great, as well!"
2,MM5P9cKlzovYLcf5qf2SwQ,7/6/2016,4 star rating,"This place was super cool and trendy with an all white interior, it actually felt very Miami to me. I thought this was a fun experience since Omakase tends to feel very proper and formal, this on the other hand felt like fun Omakase for a younger crowd. My group and I made a reservation for the sushi bar since doing Omakase at the table seems a bit silly to me and our sushi chef Kei was very interactive and was fun to talk to. I enjoyed my meal but the one issue I did find with all the pieces, I felt all the pieces were on the small side and my group left not 100% full. I did the $120 Omakase which came with a little over 20 pieces.The food:  Striped Jack or Shima Aji- This is one of my fav fishes and this piece was very nice, I really loved the flavor and the texture was great. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Salt Marinated Blue Fin Tuna- I was a little surprised that this piece was just good. I normally really like blue fin tuna.Golden Eye Snapper or Kinmedai- I really liked this one a lot, this had excellent favor and was a fav.King Salmon from Tasmania- This was another favorite, simply amazing.Horse Mackerel or Aji with Fresh Ginger and Scallion- I normally love this piece but the one here was just good, it was surprisingly more mild in flavor than I am used to.Hokkaido Scallop or Hotate with Shisho and Yuzu- The scallop was so perfectly sweet and the texture was amazing. This was a fav.Medium Fatty Tuna or Chutoro from Spain- The Chutoro is a fav and the one here was really good. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Jumbo Shrimp Liver Sauce- This was a unique dish, it was the crab liver on top of a beautiful jumbo shrimp, I enjoyed the flavor of this one but it does have a sea funk that could be off putting for some.Big Eye Snapper with Yuzukosho- It's basically Big eye snapper with a yuzu pepper paste. I thought this piece totally worked, it had great texture and flavor.Santa Barbara Uni with Ikura and Shisho- This was so good, it was perfectly balanced. I liked how the salty Ikura paired with the sea urchin, very good.Japanese Fresh Water Eel or Unagi- I normally love eel and the texture here was nice but I couldn't help feel that the eel was a tad fishy.Grunt Fish- I eat a ton of sushi but I never heard of Grunt Fish but I am a fan. It was really nice, it kinda looked like Striped Jack to me.Sockeye Salmon- Great as usual, so velvety. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Yellowtail Belly- This was excellent, this was a fav and it tasted like butter, no it actually tasted like butter. Nom nomJapanese Snapper or Madai with Shiso and Sesame Seeds- This was such a perfect pairing.Butter Fish- This had really nice texture, the flavor was good but it kinda reminded me of eel for some reason.Amberjack Belly or Kanpachi- One of my favorite fishes and this was exceptional, this was a fav.Baby Sardine or Shirasu with Quail Egg- I don't normally like any Sardine and this was no exception, this was my least favorite. It was really fishy to me. Chopped Chutoro with Otoro Pickled Radish and Scallion- This was so unique and I really enjoyed the flavor, the pickled radish pops with flavor and pairs well with the fish. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Japanese Striped Bass- It was really nice flavor and texture, but it was more chewy than I expected. Baby Sardine with Crumbled Egg Yolk- It was unique but any sardine is fishy and I am not a fan. Second piece that I didn't care for.Hokkaido Uni- Not the prettiest piece of Uni I have seen but the Hokkaido Uni was excellent. This was a fav.Tamago- The last piece was the sweetened Japanese omelette and it was good, nothing amazing but good."
3,MM5P9cKlzovYLcf5qf2SwQ,12/7/2015,3 star rating,"All I wanted was to think 1 or 8 was great. Not just because I love rhyming, but because I prefer fantastic dinners to mediocre meals.Don't get me wrong; there were definitely highlights to our meal: The large space hidden behind a seemingly small bar is gorgeous. It's clean, and vibrant, and we felt primed for a stellar meal. Our appetizers were also excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed the fried chicken, the dumplings, and more...all satisfying and delicious.Unfortunately, the sushi is supposedly the star of the show here, and it was nothing if not underwhelming. I suppose we could be somewhat at fault because we didn't opt for the much-praised omakase option, but if the place is high quality, that excellence should extend to the maki, the nigiri, and across the board. Even more frustrating was that the service was perfunctory and inattentive. The servers simply forgot about us on multiple occasions. I can appreciate that they might be extremely busy on a  Saturday evening, but we were forced to actually flag someone down after 15 minutes to order. When we finally did, the woman who I suppose was slated to be our waitress got visibly angry at the man we tapped, took back the table...and then proceeded to again ignore us for the rest of the meal. Quite simply, especially at this price point, I have to expect both the sushi and the service to be much better."
4,MM5P9cKlzovYLcf5qf2SwQ,6/17/2018,3 star rating,I was a bit disappointed after hearing the hype for this place for many years. The food was decent but not necessarily worth the trek from Manhattan. Food:Hokkaido uni - goodOh toro - ok Red snapper - ok  Aka ebi - okDuck taco - okOden - was good
5,MM5P9cKlzovYLcf5qf2SwQ,2/9/2020,5 star rating,"Just had the omakase at the new location on DeKalb. They escort you to the secret back counter with 6 seats. Here the sushi chef will prepare the best fish from Japan. I would say this is the best sushi I've had in Brooklyn. I've traveled to Japan and this is on par with some of the best. The service is fantastic, and the chef made sure we were happy. Highly recommend!"
6,MM5P9cKlzovYLcf5qf2SwQ,10/1/2020,5 star rating,"One of the best Japanese restaurant in Brooklyn. Price to quality ratio is very good. The Karaage (fried chicken) is delicious and not greasy.   The Japanese staff were friendly, hugely accommodating and efficient. Overall, this is a solid Japanese fare experience. I highly recommend"

8,MM5P9cKlzovYLcf5qf2SwQ,12/16/2019,5 star rating,Came here for a quick snack in the bar area. There were a lot of families and kids coming in through the door on a Sunday night which means this place must be family friendly as well! The inside area is partitioned away from the bar. The bar area in the front was very classy. The most memorable were the oysters as the oysters themselves tasted amazingly fresh and the sauce was such a unique flavor. Rather than the standard sauce provided for oysters they created their own miso blend
9,MM5P9cKlzovYLcf5qf2SwQ,4/14/2017,3 star rating,"Read so many good reviews and was extremely excited to try their omakase. When the first half of the omakase came, I almost stood up and walked out of the door. They were the tiniest nigiri I've ever seen in my life! Are they made for barbies? Each piece was like the size of my thumb! (Btw-I'm petite) and I started looking for other restaurants nearby that I can go afterward during the meal. The quality of the fish was good though and the seasoning was simple. The yellowtail collar was pretty big though (but it was $24), and it was pretty tender. I especially love the radish dipped with soy sauce. We felt that the food wasn't enough and flipped through the pictures on yelp and decided to order the fancy ""1 or 8 roll. It was NOT a good decision at all. Besides the uni and salmon roe, the flavor of the roll itself was not right. The vegetables inside sort of threw it off. The food isn't bad, but I bet you can find something better with similar price range in manhattan."
10,LyCE268_fz_MAZieFZY1lA,6/13/2022,4 star rating,"it was good but the prices have gone sky high.  Can't blame the restaurant as all prices for food whether bought to cook at home or for eating out have greatly  increased.  Hello, inflation.WhIle the prices are now higher at this restaurant and the portions smaller, the quality of the food has not decreased and the service remains excellent."
11,LyCE268_fz_MAZieFZY1lA,6/26/2022,2 star rating,Sweet waitress but the food is terrible and really overpriced. 2 insanely greasy/oily chicken burritos for $20 each and the smallest portion of guac for $16 ‍
12,LyCE268_fz_MAZieFZY1lA,10/24/2022,2 star rating,Way overpriced - $20 for the worst enchiladas I've ever had. Service was good but not enough to make up for the food quality and price.
13,LyCE268_fz_MAZieFZY1lA,12/14/2019,4 star rating,"Four solid stars for this long lasting downtown institution. I remember going to this place in high school with hopes of somehow sneaking past the bouncer to head upstairs to the lounge. They are pretty stringent with their carding process so I never did get to live out that dream until adulthood.Nonetheless, the upstairs lounge is also where the bathrooms are located so you can always scope out the scene that way if you'd like. The lounge offers dancing, hookah and drinks. If that's not your scene, grab a table in the dining room and eat some average Mexican-American fare perhaps paired with a pitcher of their Sangria or Margaritas. Whatever your libation, know that it will be strong. Service is super efficient and friendly.  You can't really go wrong if you're in the area and want a laid back atmosphere for casual fun times."
14,LyCE268_fz_MAZieFZY1lA,7/25/2021,3 star rating,"This is what the restaurant considers as ""Nachos"" $9 but hey at least they served it with a fresh cucumber! Make sure to savor every bite mmm"
15,LyCE268_fz_MAZieFZY1lA,7/3/2021,3 star rating,"We ordered a quesadillas which came with rice and beans (very, I mean very small portions) we also ordered guacamole with chips and a steak Fajita plate. The food was ok. The drinks are strong if that's what your looking for at $12-$17 you get your money's worth. The top floor is the party seen, but be safe up there! It gets super crowded, no mask and it's impossible to social distance in this place. Oh, and one very small restroom which is crazy since they have outdoor dining, first floor indoor dining and top floor bar and dance floor."
16,LyCE268_fz_MAZieFZY1lA,8/9/2020,4 star rating,"I have been here numerous times since 2006. I've never been here regularly. It always seems to be a couple years in between visits. But it's been consistently solid. I'm not gonna tell you the food is amazing, but it's definitely good. It's really a good spot for any occasion. Great for dining with friends or a date. Love the vibes. Favorite spot is the rooftop patio area. It's enclosed, so you can be seated there in the winter as well. Was just there a couple of weeks ago for covid outdoor dining. They have a good seating situation. Definitely worth the visit for Mexican food in the area."

20,rPXlTqHLYKcXyADOeqzwbg,8/9/2016,1 star rating,I come here every morning since its very close to where I attend class.  The lady behind the counter is extremely rude on multiple occasions.  I realize that service doesn't have to always be good but there's one lady who always have a very rude tone with the customer.  There's too much to write about the various incidents but I hope Starbucks can see this post and take action to investigate.  I would hate to not come here to get my coffee every morning.

27,rPXlTqHLYKcXyADOeqzwbg,1/21/2018,2 star rating,"Starbucks is Starbucks no matter where you go. There is consistency is tastes and flavors so it comes down to service. This particular one, the people were nice enough, but even in the slow down time, they forgot my order twice and I had to remind them about my food and drink since people were just standing around and talking and not multitasking. Maybe it's that I'm used to getting Starbucks in other parts of the city where people are able to handle both."
28,rPXlTqHLYKcXyADOeqzwbg,9/10/2013,2 star rating,"The slowest Starbucks I have ever been to.I typically hate Starbucks so the fact that my coworkers like it and I was in need of a walk and decided to go and get some coffee for the office made me 1) angry because it's Starbucks and 2) okay feeling because it meant I got to take a walk.  When I arrived, the line was already beginning to go out the door....At 4PM.  I stood in line, tapped my foot, and waited and waited until it was finally my turn.  The barista was okay but the person handling the register needs to learn to swipe cards faster and give back change quicker than counting one penny at a time.  Verrrry slow which is verrrry bad when you need to get back to work.  Good thing I'm not a fan of burnt coffee."

I stood there for a while watching the scene as she spoke because she was so engrossed in the conversation that she did not seem to realized I ordered.I said, ""can you please make my drink I have to go."" She went over and poured milk into the cup, and the next thing I saw was her (staff member) speaking to the women again. I said, ""can I please get a refund."" Staff (young woman) did not seem to hear me. I walked over to the cash register and asked the young man for a refund. Staff (young woman) called out to the staff (young man) and said ""no don't do it"" while lifting a cup of coffee that she walked over to after I said I wanted a refund. Staff (young woman) walked over to the cash register where I was standing and in my face said to the customers behind me on the line (direct words)- ""if anyone has an attitude like her, please let me know."" I told her that I have to go, and you kept talking to the women. Staff (young woman)- ""I am here by myself"" with a negative tone and some other verbiage as I walked out of the store. I was refunded $5:17 by the (staff) young man and was charged $5.72 by the (young woman). I noticed this at home on my account statement.

I asked for a Tropical Mango (mango, pineapple, yogurt) smoothie. I watched the girl place in a few tiny chunks of pineapple and mango into the blender with a splash of some liquid yogurt. You're a freaking froyo location, and you can't even put in... I don't know.. ACTUAL froyo? Then in comes the ice. Oh my lord. She filled that blender to the brim with ice. 90% ice. 10% fruit and liquid yogurt. 100% what the fook. Did I mention, she added a leaf from a spinach. You read that right. LIKE WHERE DID THAT EVEN COME FROM?? She didn't even have the audacity to take it out or whatever. I can't even.I'm so mad. My smoothie wasn't even smooth. It was iced. All I did was chew on ice.

One was more welcoming when I stepped up close to register and smiled and signaled me to the other girl next to her, but the Russian girl when she came up to register and saw me looked at me like ""I have to take care of you?"" The music is loud for such a small place and she spoke so low, have to think purposely like she didn't really even want to attend to me, and kept looking at me so weirdly. Like a long stare. She looked annoyed to assist me. She didn't even want to give me a kid when I asked for it and looked at me like I was crazy to ask for one. Maybe I didn't need at that moment but what about if I needed later. What would have been a pleasant lunch break and treat, turned into a WTF?! Just for ice cream. :/Secondly the cup was way too expensive. I had a regular vanilla small cup with less than half full ice cream two slices of kiwi and three slices of strawberries and chocolate chips topping like a small spoonful. $9!!!"

Not as many options as other places may have, but the standard ones are there plus some extra. The taro froyo is my favorite. They also have a new dark chocolate flavor which is absolutely delicious. I also like the nutella and cookie flavors. Toppings are pretty standard, fruit, lychee, and some chocolate. They have acai bowls that I have been wanting to try. As all Red Mangoes are, the bowl seems to ring up fairly pricey, I can't seem to get my bowl to be under $6 (unless I have zero toppings)."

I'm not talking about skimping a little I'm talking about you can see the ridges and stick quarters in the center of both of the cups and the quarters not even touch the froyo which only lined the edge of the cups. I posted photos to show what I'm talking about. Disappointed.

I TRIED to quit Dunkin' Donuts for Starbucks. That didn't work out at all. Starbucks is just too trendy and trying to be cool with their ""tall grande venti"" sizes. Why not just call it small medium and large like everyone? Then the prices are ridiculous. I usually ordered a ""tall"" light caramel frappe and it came to almost $5! Last time I went to the Rego Park location, I waited 10 mins for my drink and it was way too watery. Usually most Starbucks I wait 10-15 mins for my frappe. So I'm loyal to DD because I get a small caramel iced latte, pay about 3 dollars for it (even the medium isn't over $4) and I get it in 2 minutes."

Instead, there were two teenage workers completely ignoring the couple of people waiting for service. They were maskless (in a health store!) and it took a good 15 minutes for them to even acknowledge my presence.The store has a digital menu. The wheatgrass shots are listed as one for $3, two for $5. I asked for two shots and was told it would be $6. I pointed to the menu to show the girl the correct price. She turned around, looked, shrugged, and said it's $6. I walked out.Everyone who works at this store should be fired."

What I liked about the smoothie is that it used whole ingredients and I was able to have protein powder that fit my needs of being gluten free, soy free, and lactose free. My issue is the type of protein powder they use....it was NOT good. I'm usually not that picky but it tasted like chalk. Would I go back and try other things on their menu? Absolutely! But, for my GF, LF, and SF people just understand that this might not be the best protein smoothie...Also not sure why there was LOUD music at 9 am (I could barely hear the nice person taking my order)...but it might just be me getting older lol.Customer service is a 10/10 and I will always be a repeat customer when customer service is stellar."

Ordered said Wontons with noodles, straight up. Probably ~$8 for the bowl and it nets you 5 gigantic wontons. Wontons are filled with pork and an entire piece of shrimp. A more discerning palate might call it dry but the texture of the filling was passable and flavorful enough for me. The egg noodles were pretty standard. Broth was on the thinner side and a little bland. Their kitchen is open aired and you can see that they have an extra large vat of broth in the main island. This vat isn't very accessible therefore I imagine that minimal seasoning occurs. The thinness also indicates that they don't simmer it over a long enough period of time to really develop the favors. Interestingly, they serve everything is disposable bowls and dishes so workers are constantly lugging out trash. The tea that they serve you was delightful and very much welcome on a cold early evening in mid April. Workers are quick to take your order and the food comes out fast. The Chow Fun looked like it had been pre-made as I did see workers pull many hot entrees out from a warmer. The beef chow fun was still delicious despite this. A solid spot for wontons and Cantonese food in general especially when you are in a hurry. They welcome take out orders as well for an easy grab-and-go experience."

Efficient, fast, and kind.5/5 price*: for noodle soup, it's pretty cheap. $8.75 for just wonton noodle soup. If you want it with a protein (duck, pork), then it's ~$11. Still pretty fair if you're craving wonton noodle soup. I recommend the duck to add some more flavor to the broth, but this can be oily cause of the duck fat.

I call in and score a res for 4 of us on a Saturday night. He says something along the lines of you got it and I'll call you or you call me to confirm. I knew we were in for a treat. Day of, I called and left a message which he returned saying hey, come on in I'm opening a little early. OKAY! The classic Sicilian trattoria is COZY with maybe 8 tables. Immediately welcomed, you feel like you're home in the best way possible. Coats were taken and hung, and we were immediately seated.  The CAULIFLOWER TORTINO was out of this world. The ARTICHOKE was standard but good. Can't go wrong by ordering the CAPRESE e PROSCIUTTO... I mean, fresh mozzarella, tomatoes & prosciutto. Yum. The GNOCCHI is something straight from heaven. They are soft pillows and melt in your mouth nearly immediately. The gorgonzola cream sauce we selected was phenomenal. It's as though all previously eaten gnocchi (elsewhere) has been some sort of joke; a poorly-executed simulation of what gnocchi CAN be. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. For some reason, I ordered the VEAL CHOP MILANESE as my main dish instead of pasta like everyone else, but I'm sort of glad I did. It was delicious. Perfectly breaded, seasoned, and covered in a mound of chopped green beans and tomatoes. It was a dish I'd never had before so it was an adventure in expanding my horizons (said the girl who eats sweetbreads and the like). That said, I snagged a bite of the SPAGHETTI CARBONARA and it too was fantastically creamy and dotted with pancetta. Passing on the solid recommendation, should you find yourself in Manhattan, head to the upper east side. It'll be worth the journey. Oh, and bring CASH - no credit cards accepted.  I've seen a lot of mentions about it being expensive... but I didn't think so. Maybe it's the Silicon Valley in me or simply eating at/supporting really good local restaurants, but dishes ran $15-40. Pasta dishes were all about $17. The value is definitely present.I will 100% return time and time again when in New York. It's now one of my favorite restaurants."

Recently we went by on a rainy Tuesday evening with my mother, who had a walker. The manager ""greeter"" looked at us and told us, ""first of all, it's cash only, and we don't have room for the walker.""

88,iV5yy8EbjsPoYWtjRhB61Q,2/16/2019,5 star rating,"I've eaten at Nica multiple times, tonight being the most recent.  They deliver a consistently great meal all around for a reasonable price, my girlfriend and I have it as a go-to for an nice dinner out (like Valentine's Day, dinner with friends, etc.).  Note they are cash only (and will tell you this when making the reservation) and have a general time limit of 90-minutes per table (which is very acceptable when you know in advance coupled with the quick service I'll speak about below) which is listed on the menu.The food was great, tonight consisted of the stuffed mushrooms, red peppers with anchovies, and lamb chops.  Both the mushrooms and lamb chops (including a side of roasted potatoes) I'd had there before and were as wonderful as ever, but I was greatly surprised how excellent the peppers were and how the anchovies really worked with the flavor!  A glass of red wine was had as well, however I can't recall which one I got, only that it was well suited to the rest of the meal.  Portion sizes are generous, but not overwhelming so, you'll leave happily full but will have room for dessert if you don't have too much bread or too many appetizers.  If you do have too much bread (which is fresh and very tasty) prepare to leave stuffed.The service was prompt, the food arrived quickly and was cooked perfectly to order (medium rare for the lamb chops), and the staff was able to answer a question on the menu quickly and accurately without a second thought.  They also called earlier in the afternoon to confirm my reservation, which is a nice touch (they've done this every time I've made a reservation).The restaurant is very small, but not uncomfortably so, it's simply limited in the number of tables so reservations are a must along with promptness for your time.  The menu is also only 2 pages, with a 3rd page of specials for the day, and a nice wine list (wine & beer only) for bottles and some by the glass.All in all, you really can't go wrong with anything you order here, you'll be tempted to ask what the disk someone else ordered that you just saw come out (and there's no shame in asking).  It's a great spot for a date, dinner with another couple, or adult family (parents, siblings, not children) and friends."

Your table won't be able to fit and honestly the prices were pretty high for a diner.I sat down and wasn't greeted for probably 10 minutes. Which I thought was weird until I saw a wonderful performance and she came to our table right after. So it makes sense why we waited so long, our waitress was prepping herself for her performance! It was so fun to hear and see everyone singing and dancing and enjoying their job.I ordered the eggs benedict and first it was $19 which I do think is very high for what it is, but I can't even lie it was delicious! I can't remember what my friend got but she wasn't disappointed either, just surprised when we got the bill. But I suppose for a show and meal it was worth it!I do think the owner coming around and asking everyone to donate to the servers college fund was a little ridiculous. If we wanted to donate we would have, I mean we're tipping them for the meal anyway (which is also included on your bill). The pressure to donate money was uncomfortable and not for me, but the food and performance was good!"

Make sure to plan ahead as there is typically a line to enter. However, they seat according to party size to maximize space and efficiency. So the line moves quickly. Food is amazing in flavor, while higher in price, you make up for it with the show and entertainment.  Highly suggest this for musical fans and non as there is something for everyone."

As for the space, neat but very crowded and tight, which made for a very loud environment. As for the management, terrible and rude.  My hope is that they aren't taking advantage of the workers/singers who are trying to make it, but given what we know about people and business, that's likely the case.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed the experience and would definitely go back."

Now, I am not usually an ice cream fan but I ate the whole darn thing! On top of the amazing food, the performances were jaw dropping which caused my friends and I to stay well after finishing our meals.

The food quality was not great.  On both visits, I had to wait almost thirty minutes for my order to come to my table.  I understand that businesses get busy.  However, on both visits, it was not insanely busy.  There was no reason that my food needed to take that long.  I understand that things happen that are out of their control.  But once the food came to me, neither the appearance nor the long wait proved to be worth my time.  On both visits, I ordered from their breakfast menu.  Neither plate tasted great.  When I am in the New York area and in the mood for a meal, I will not come back here again.  I do not feel like I can count on them for overall customer service satisfaction."

My friends and I got in early on a redeye and were desperate to find somewhere to eat and came up with this place. We got there around 7:30 and were greeted with  waters and OJ on the house which is always a good start. We enjoyed everything we ordered and sat around for awhile just chatting and planning our next move while people watching out of the giant windows. They checked on us regularly for refills and we were never rushed out which was great. Close to Central park if you want to stop in before or after a long stroll.

When we arrived, despite the early hour, there were quite a few people, some travelers, a few drunk partygoers who were probably heading home after. They were really rowdy and the restaurant managers didn't stop them from climbing over the booths so that was unpleasant. The waitress we had was very nice. In terms of food, we all know the quality of diners isn't the best but for breakfast, it gets the job done. Boyfriend had pancakes with eggs, I went with eggs florentine which is basically eggs benedict but instead of the canadian bacon it's spinach. Hot coffee was a must, and they were pretty quick to refill our cups which I appreciated. Overall my experience was good considering. This is probably the better choice amongst the remaining diners in Brooklyn. I'd recommend stopping by if this is the fare you're craving, but honestly otherwise it's nothing to write home about."

It was exactly what I wanted and pretty dam healthy too. I'd say it was a great meal but service by my standards was meh.

Decided to try this one out for a change of food options after our yoga class. We walked to the diner, but there's a convenient, if small, parking lot right next to it. The exterior and interior still have an old fashion decor, but it lends to the mom-n-pop feel of the place. It was a busy Sunday morning, but they were able to give us a table right away. Service was prompt and gracious! Food came out fast, offers of hot coffee refills were frequent, and they have no problems customizing your order to taste.I ordered the corned beef hash with two fried eggs and replaced the home fries with French fries. It also comes with your choice of toast on the side. I was ravenous that day and wanted something sweet after my already huge order, so I tacked on a Belgian waffle topped with bananas, and whipped cream on the side, to share with my friends. Everything came out quickly, and all at the same time. My corned beef hash and eggs came out delicious and cooked right. Fries were hot, but not all were crispy. My friends enjoyed their bacon, egg, and cheese on a roll, and their customized broccoli and mozzarella omelet with sausage and pancakes. It took us a little while to finish our main dishes, so by the time we got to the waffle, it was no longer crispy, if it was crispy to begin with. I think of it as a personal error, not the diner's. We should have ordered it after finishing our main dishes, or asked them to bring it out later. It also doesn't hurt to ask them to make sure the waffle is cooked crispy.Overall, I enjoyed dining here. I plan on returning the next time I'm in the mood for diner food."

The nicely grilled skin and the dark meat made up for it. Also, dousing their BBQ & hot sauce masked the dryness. The side of rice and beans was just ok.

I got a table and sat next to the door. It was chilly when people walked in so remember, sit closer to the counter. The meal was pretty good. Tastey chicken, rice and beans were ok. Just a little pricey, i guess it's because i had to pay a little bit for the 1/2 chicken. She charged me the wrong amount, i guess. Anyway, they get a 4 star from me only because the food was ok.

137,zKWki9qwaWU7zcB-zVR_kA,8/11/2017,3 star rating,"Cafe 52 had all the makings of greatness when they first opened: It's small and quaint, has limited but decent outdoor seating, a fabulous location just across from the 52nd Street station, and a menu of diner classics with a healthy slant to it (not common for this part of the hood at the time). They were reasonably fast in delivery and the place was clean and solid for a lunch date or solo WiFi session.Then things started taking a turn for the worse: Deliveries were slower. The preparation of the food for takeout and deliveries were sloppier and generally unappetizing. Eventually the food itself began to suffer, my burgers were overly salty, breakfast plates were skimpy, mac and cheese options were bland, and the kale salad was more of a sad plate of greens than a vibrant, feel-good option. Sadly, the upkeep on the interior was taking a toll: the grimness of an open but small kitchen lead to a small film (sticky) feel to the tables and menus; the place was no longer as clean as it used to be. To make matters worse, the staff had a slight overhaul resulting in lots of incompetence which turned into messed up orders.I've begun patronizing less and less in fear of additional disappointment. I want to give them more chances to see if they fix some of the aforementioned issues. For now, the breakfast is decent and they've managed to add hashbrown patties as of last year. (#1) and there is a nice little TV in the main dining area.__________(#1) There is hope after all."

Usually  I have just ordered take-out, but I wanted to try something new for a change. I ordered blueberry pancakes and sausage and my husband ordered one of the egg dishes that came with bacon, toast and home fries.The atmosphere  was very hectic (no peace and quiet here) and the service was a tad slow, but they are making the most of the small space.The food was really good. My order came with two pancakes, and they were incredibly thick and fluffy, I don't think I'm exaggerating to say almost an inch thick in the center. I ate one and brought one home. The sausage was a single patty, thin, very flavorful and just a little too salty but good. I'm really picky about home fries because so many places put paprika on them which I can't stand but these were small red potatoes roasted and tasted super fresh!  They also score points because they have soy milk for coffee, and they brewed fresh decaf for me!"

I like that their items are of high quality, but as they tend to be low on the amount of proteins they offer, I end up eating a double portion of carbs, usually bread, and then I'm hungry again in an hour.  The price/value is just ok and service is generally slow at most locations. Overall, a great spot for lunch if you're looking for something light, however, their breakfast & dinner menus are somewhat limited on options that keep you full. My favorite items are the ham & cheese Quiche and the Avocado toast, but, better to come here for coffee and pastries as those are very good and well-priced for what you get."

156,9eZrG8nANKuoyGSqdj_gew,3/4/2019,2 star rating,I had hoped for my 1000th review to write about a 5 star find but unfortunately I can't. I tried three dishes which I took out from Ashoka with some friends from India. We were all disappointed. The best of the three was the Lamb Jalfarezi which had a nice smokey flavor. It was the only dish of the three that we enjoyed and finished. The lamb vindaloo was very spicy but lacked the subtle flavor of a well made vindaloo sauce. It was like tasting straight hot sauce. The chicken korma was poorly seasoned and had an after taste. It was in our collective opinion not well made. It reminded me of school cafeteria chicken ala king - not a particularly good thing. Overall the food was seasoned more like Bengali food than Indian food. The accompanying green and tamarind sauces were very watery (see photo) and smelled old. The white rice that accompanied the order tasted undercooked.

The lamb vindaloo had the perfect amount of heat and spice for me. I'm kicking myself that I didn't order more, and especially that I forgot to order naan. Oh well, a reason to make this a repeat place."

One of the better place I've been to, the chicken was seasoned much better than other places I've had, and the chicken bites were big and portioned. I will say that the prices are a little bit higher than other places I've been to, but I would say it's worth it. Would order form here again, and would recommend to anyone in Flatbush!"

Their lunch specials are awesome and even if it seems pricey, the portions are more than enough to feel full from!I ABSOLUTELY love their Chicken Tikka Masala. I literally dream about it. No other place compares. However, I am not overly familiar with Indian food and can't speak on authenticity or how close it is to other tikka masala but it is AMAZING regardless. The chicken Vindaloo, samosas, garlic naan, and rice are also great!GrubHub delivery sometimes takes a while but when I've ordered over the phone it's been very quick! Always worth whatever wait there is though.Now go try it and thank me later!"

Ordering takeout from Ashoka is always a pleasant, simple and satisfying experience. I have never had a problem and the food always arrives, quickly and delicious. It's almost just as good as being there and eating in the restaurant. I have sampled many of their dishes and I truly can't complain about one. The chicken tiki masala is amazing, the curry dishes are all amazing and samosas and nann bread are always perfect. You wouldn't expect that with delivery but like I said they definitely take pride in their food and it shows. The price point is fair but for what you get it really doesn't compare. Everything here is perfectly seasoned never too spicy or bland but just the perfect amount of spice in every dish. They also have the option to adjust the spice level when you place your order which is really great! If you are bored with your Friday night wings and pizza, give this place a try you won't be disappointed. ***UPDATE***I recently actually came into the restaurant to eat and it was so wonderful. The manager was the sweetest! I felt as if I had been invited into his home. He even brought out free appetizers and deserts for us to try. The food as always was fresh and delicious. If you are in the area and want Indian this place is definitely worth the try."

The food here is delicious and thoughtfully prepared as I have asked them to modify dishes to my liking before and they were more than happy to accommodate me. I love the naan bread and large selection of vegetarian dishes that they have. My only complaint is that the service is a bit slow, which is not completely  a bad thing because they take the time to prepare great food but If you are in a hurry between classes or on a lunch break from work I suggest taking it to go."

The Catskills Rainbow Trout was the best main dish of the evening, but the off-menu spaghetti marinara made for a bambino took us all back to our favorite pasta place in Italy. Dessert is not to be missed. The Truffle Warm Dark Chocolate Lava Cake perfectly balanced sweet and bitter as arguably one of the best lava cakes out there, but it was the Meyer Lemon Tart that was metaphorically licked clean off the plate.  Several dishes were good, not great; My Grandmothers Ravioli was rather left to ""No, you have it. No, you."" Portions run smaller, so order more than usual. The bonus is you get to try more goodness.Our server was patient and made excellent suggestions. The cold evening outside sparkled with the twinkling fairy-lit trees and columns of incandescent office windows, which made for a wonderful contrast to the warm, cozy and elegant interior.

It was light, fluffy, and came out piping hot!   Scrambled eggs toast with leeks and mushroom salad was great.  I thought leek and mushroom were in the eggs as the description didn't mention the salad but the salad was great and I just put the salad on top of the toast to eat.  It also comes with speck but we asked to not include it.  The service was attentive and professional.   The root juice was amazing.  The ginger kick will wake you up.  The regular coffee came out nice and fresh.  Nothing I didn't like about this place."

Although we waited 45 minutes for our table with a reservation, we still left very happy. The service was excellent, the decor was charming, and the food was incredible. We ordered the following:-SHEEP'S MILK RICOTTA-STEAK TARTARA PIEMONTESE: prime-aged wagyu beef, hazelnuts, black truffle. The truffle really came through and I loved it. Definitely an unique take on the classic tartare. -TONNARELLI CACIO E PEPE: may not be for people that are sensitive to salt. The pasta is simple but very tasty - reminded me of Italy. -MEZZE RIGATONI: lamb bolognese, sheep's milk ricotta, mint. The pasta was al dente and the sauce was mouthwatering. -DRY-AGED NY STRIP STEAK: served with polenta fritta & salsa verde. We were pretty full by the time steak was served but we still took a taste. The steak was cooked to perfection but needed to be paired with the polenta and salsa verde in the same bite to capture a burst of flavor.Oh, we also ordered cocktails just cannot recall the names right now. They were great though. We are really happy that we chose this restaurant for our celebratory dinner."

They also have great specials that are always worth a try. The staff is always very helpful and are good at making suggestions on menu items. I've found the sommelier to be helpful in picking a good wine within your budget as well. The atmosphere is perfect for either a date or a dinner with family and friends.

The eggs were perfectly cooked and the kale salad paired together with the spaghetti squash was heavenly! I would highly recommend this place if you visit NYC.

The vibe of the staff didn't feel particularly welcoming. It felt like the person sitting us and the person taking our order were in a high-stress environment, and you could tell by the way they spoke to us. In my head, I was thinking ""okay, as long as the food as other reviews make it out to be, then it's all good!"" However, I personally found the food to be underwhelming. The schnitzel was nice and crispy, but I didn't identify anything special about it to justify the price point. The peri peri wings didn't really have any flavor and neither did the peri peri kebab. The salmon burger was mid also with no distinguishing features. In fact, the only thing that I genuinely enjoyed was the spaghetti, which I neglected to take a picture of. The sauce and the pasta combined so well for a flavorful bite. I don't see myself coming back here again, and I'd list this spot as another one of those widely shared NYC restaurants on social media that just didn't meet expectations. I can get a better kebab from a NYC halal truck for 1/3 the price."

Especially in Chelsea as you have hungry entitled people that can't understand why they're not getting a table right away.So I've never commented on my constant annoying interaction with the hostess. Until today I'm over it.But this does  not mean as a hostess that a simple ""hello welcome! I'll be right with you!"" isn't a basic thing to say when you're busy.It simply sets the tone and you're the one and only person who's greeting everyone that comes in through the door. I always come in for pick up since I work a few blocks away and I constantly debate on actually going because I can not stand the hostess nasty attitude . She's just not welcoming and has the most serious I don't want to be here face.  She deserves a vacation because it's been months and I've never once got a ""welcome! Or hi! With a positive attitude""  ANYWAYS, FOOD WISEThe duck bacon egg sandwich is amazing.It's perfectly toasted with fluffy buttery soft scrambled eggs. Tomato jam and a bomb homemade hot sauce.  You can either do fries or a salad. The salad is bland just arugula so just go for the fries they're always good.But the sandwich alone is honestly fulfilling.I love their cantaloupe juice it's fresh and great. I've also had their waffle it's pretty nice.The  chicken sandwich used to be my favorite but I've just had it too much is the past few years.Their steak and eggs are pretty good too! Fresh steak nice and juicy never dry. I failed to mention the servers are on top of the tables when I've dined in. They always always greet me and ask if I need help and hand off my food.The soho location is also great never had an issue !"

When my party showed up at Jack's this morning to request a table, there was not one host, not two, but three hosts busily chatting it up at the front of the house. When they eventually found a break in their conversation, they turned their attention to us and guided us to a table outside.After getting seated, it took more than 20 minutes before somebody came to take our order. I wish I was exaggerating, but I am not: I took out my iPhone and started a timer. When our orders were finally taken, it was yet another 25 minutes before our food arrived. This is definitely not the type of place you want to dine at if you're in a rush.The food here is ok, but definitely on the expensive side. I was still quite hungry after I finished my $18 plate of two poached eggs, small slice of sourdough bread, and two slices of tomato on baked halloumi. I was ready to grab more food elsewhere after I finished my meal.When everyone had roughly cleared their plates, it took another 20 minutes or so before we realized nobody was coming to bus our table, and we had to flag down somebody to our table to ask for the check. The owner/manager/GM of Jack's Wife Freda should honestly fire two of the hosts at the front of the house, as they literally stood around doing nothing to help speed up the service or improve the dining experience for guests.I won't be stopping by again for a meal here."

Took my mom out for brunch, we ordered Mediterranean Breakfast (Furthest from camera), Duck Bacon (Center), Madame Freda (closest to camera), and 2 Bottomless drip (2 coffees)First, the Madame Freda: served with duck prosciutto, cheddar béchamel, Swiss cheese, and a sunny side up egg with a choice of fries or salad.  Aesthetically, it was very appetizing. The flavor was pretty good. Duck prosciutto was very salty but it complimented well with the egg and bread. Basically, tasted like a prosciutto, egg & cheese sandwich. But still a good brunch option!Second, Mediterranean breakfast: served with 2 eggs any style, chopped salad, greek yogurt, and avocado and pita bread. Very healthy and well balanced meal. The greek yogurt tasted almost like cheese. The salad tasted light with tomatoes and seasoned well with salt and pepper. Avocados and pita bread made a great combination.Third, side order of duck bacon. The duck bacon portion size was very small and not worth $9. It was about 2-3 strips. It tasted very similar to the duck prosciutto in the Madame Freda sandwich. It was relatively salty and has more meat than normal bacon. Would not get again.Overall: the brunch experience was pretty good. It's a nice, casual, and quaint place to enjoy brunch.  Service was perfect even though they seemed overwhelmed."

Even though notices are posted on the doors that masks are required, we saw staff interacting with guests without them on and they did not say one word about it. Coming down from our room to go out for the day, we saw police in the lobby. Upon our return several hours later, they were still there. We talked to some residents of the neighborhood who happened to be outside and one of them shook his head and said the presence of cops was a regular occurrence and the hotel has been nothing but trouble for the block since it opened. Beginning at 1 in the morning, we could hear a loud party through the vents. We called down, concerned about both the noise and that the hotel would allow gatherings of over 10 people. The hotel staff member said they would take care of it, but the noise persisted. Finally my partner-at 3 in the morning-went to the source of the noise on the floor above us. He reconnected with the hotel staff and was told that they broke up a party on the floor below and did not realize there was another party on the higher floor-a surprise to us as the hallways on our floor as well as the one above were saturated with both noise and the smell of weed. So to sum up, gentrification and unhappy neighbors + heavy cop presence + lax COVID protocols = 1 miserable star. Actually, the one star is just for the food because Beebe's the restaurant was pretty damn good."

I picked this room specifically because the tub was the it factor of the room. Check in was a breeze. Their check in desk is unlike a traditional one. The table is low and they have chairs in front of the table which felt very conference like. The woman checked me in and gave me my key and off I was.My 9th floor room was spectacular! The room was enormous! It felt like my own little apartment, no lie. I loved the minimalist decor, the soft wooden floors, the balcony and bathing in the tub was such a treat. This is seriously one of the coolest and most amazing hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. And for the price I paid it was a steal, this type of room feels like it belongs in a $300 a night hotel. The downside: the room was very cold, they brought me up a space heater but I was still freezing. There were no wash cloths in the bathroom, only small towels. The bed was okay but the pillows were amazing. The lighting was also really dim. Customer service I felt could have been better. They didn't seem to really go above or beyond.  Also it's in a section of Long Island City with nothing to do and the surroundings are pretty ugly. I didn't leave the hotel because I didn't feel too safe walking anywhere alone and it was a dead residential area. Lastly, the Wifi was terrible!Definitely come here in the summer or spring, I was sad I couldn't utilize the balcony due to coldness and rain!"

For someone who is familiar with the subway system from my previous visit it really doesn't take too much to get from this hotel to somewhere like Time Square. From the hotel to  the 39th subway entrance it took about an 8 mins walk. I picked this hotel for its amazing view of the Manhattan Skyline and it definitely was worth it. Rooms were very minimal and had an industrial feel to it. Lighting in the rooms are minimal however it was sufficient for myself and my boyfriend. Amenities such as a microwave, iron, ice bucket are not in the rooms but can easily be requested. Everything was clean upon arrival and as nurse I am super OCD about these things. Bed  was very comfy and I was able to sleep well.Some cons: no drawers to put clothes in, we mostly worked out of our suitcases. There's was a little area for hanging coats and a tiny drawer for maybe intimates.Some things that made this hotel worth it was the View from the balcony, comfy bed, accessible to the subway, and an amazing restaurant (Beebe's) locates adjacent to the lobby.I also like to mention before arriving I noticed a lot of reviews stating the check in process felt impersonal and ""cold & dark"". However, I did not get that when checking in. Staff was really nice. I will be coming back."

We both enjoyed getting to explore Queens so much! That being said, the customer service and amenities left much to be desired. Being a boutique hotel during such a tough economic time, you'd think the staff would want to provide a more pleasant experience for guests. Sadly this was not our experience.The rooms (I'll get to this later) were nicely decorated and a decent size for New York City. The restaurant on the lower level smelled delicious every time we passed it. Towels and ice both arrived quickly when requested. We also had a lovely view from the balcony of our second room. It's not often you get to face the boroughs (Queens and the Bronx in this case) so I really liked getting to see that skyline for once. We ran into problems with our first room, which didn't have a working lamp or shower head. The body sprayer worked but would not convert to the main head, meaning we couldn't realistically shower in the space. We checked in with an hour and a half to go before a planned outing, so we were dismayed to find no practical shower. When we called down to the desk, the lady there brushed me off about our time constraints and told me someone would come to ""fix it"" right away. Fifteen minutes later she curtly told me that maintenance was on the way and hung up. After another fifteen minutes my boyfriend got involved and she finally offered us another room. This was too late to solve our problems, so we arranged to change rooms upon our return. She then called back twice asking us to allow maintenance in the room anyways because he was ""about to leave for the day"" and she wanted to have the room fixed while we were gone. We agreed and left.Upon our return we went to the desk to ask for our new room keys. The person there told us our old room had been fixed and asked me if I was sure we really wanted to change rooms. I assured her we did, and she slapped two new room keys onto the desk for me without another word. We went up to collect our luggage from the old room and found nothing had been touched or fixed. We ended up with a room on a higher floor with a small balcony, which our first room didn't have. I'm glad we decided to stick to the original plan to change rooms but was dismayed with how we were treated overall. Both rooms only had one side table and a general lack of good lighting. Both beds were also lumpy with creaky bed frames. Things were dented and/or broken in places throughout. Our first room didn't have enough towels for the both of us. This hotel has a lot of potential, but the staff downstairs and the interiors of the rooms could both use an overhaul. Our close friends are getting married in Queens next year and asked us to scope this hotel out as a potential option for a wedding block of rooms. Needless to say we cannot in good conscience recommend it after the experience we had!"

Everyone has there days but this is a job and is wasn't just her it was everyone at the front desk, very sad looking people. We got a room with a balcony which we where originally scared of choosing due to the cold weather. Hoping that the heat in the room would be great, it wasn't. Super cold, we stayed for 2 nights and left the heater running but no improvement, we had to sleep with the hot water running with the bathroom door open. very disappointing granted the amount of money we spend on the room. Very sad like hotel. No one greats you at the door, not even to help with bags. Me and my husband traveled to our car three times in the COLD weather to get our bags. This hotel shouldn't be considered as a 4 star hotel if someone cant even help with your bags . If your looking for a great place to stay your better off at a motel, save your money , time and energy."

There's no draws for your clothes. But definitely was a cozy stay the view was beautiful. Balconies are the definite plus for this hotel, location was convenient about a 15 minute drive to most of my favorite restaurants - Los Amigos Chimichurry to be exact"

The room was $219 per night & also had a late check out of 3pm. I had to check out of this hotel at 10am the next day. I booked a private massage session in this room for my boyfriend & I. The room was freezing cold from the moment we walk in & our entire massage session although we set the heat up to 83 degrees when we got into the room. I went down to let this issue be known to whoever was on duty & instead of moving us to a room that the heat actually worked, they sent one space heater to my room which barely did the job. I tolerated the cold & everything  until I woke up the next day & noticed a brown stain in the sheets that i slept in.  I don't know if it was dried blood or what but I'm disgusted. The look on my partners face left me mortified & embarrassed  ! We immediately got dress to check out of the hotel. The hotel supervisor refunded me the $19 hotel fee & offered a %15 off credit for my next stay. The supervisor on duty told me that she would speak to housekeeping because the situation was unacceptable and as much as I wanted to accept that as an apology, I cannot. The sight of the stain is living rent free in my mind. I WILL NEVER stay at this hotel again over this experience. I'm completely disgusted & disappointed & embarrassed !"
194,dS2dWAIU7p9rKdAgOvzVkQ,7/5/2020,1 star rating,Absolutely horrible experience. We stayed less than 24 hours and I will never stay there again! The rooms are NOT noise proof and there was a huge party happening upstairs and hotel staff did nothing when I called them 3 times at 2am!! They did not handle the experience well and this speaks volumes about an establishment. The only good thing was Kostantinos at the rooftop bar- he was super friendly and pleasant. Otherwise- the entire place was a bust. Don't stay here- plenty of other options nearby! **UPDATE: management wrote me back and refunded my stay. It was a very prompt response especially for a holiday weekend.

The room itself $160 but it came to around $200 with the upgrade and it was $240 in total with the taxes for the one night. The floors were wood and clean. The shower was huge for no reason, but there was no bathtub which was a shame. They had a lot of extra things that could be brought to the room like microwaves, robes, an iron, etc. The whole place had a clean and industrial look. All the workers were friendly and professional. They even had conversations with us in passing and in the elevators. The location was w a c k. I know it's in the not city part of Long Island City, but there was nothing nearby besides industrial companies and a car scrap yard. There were broken down cars all over the place. My boyfriend advises that you Uber from the hotel. It's a $12 ride to Midtown. It's still not a fun place to walk around though. If the hotel was in a nicer area, it would have been a 5 star review."

I'm allergic to a lot of fruit and they even offer to take the time to clean out the juicer for me before they make anything for me. I'm moving to Maryland this summer.

I was very disappointed because it tasted like water and I literally found an ice cube inside my bowl. I was Very disappointed and when I mentioned it to the person behind the counter they said to me no way you found an ice cube? Like I was lying or brought an ice cube from home. Was Very disrespectful and insulting to say the least. I always go to the other shop around the corner but figured I will give this place a try but I will never go back there again.

I've made a report to my police precinct. If you guys go here be very careful and definitely check your charges.

204,_WXCEFUGj50TXHU5cQ38Og,1/30/2018,2 star rating,This was my first time coming here. I've had DELICIOUS acai bowls before from other places so my expectations were high. Bomb number one...the acai was frozen--not fresh. Bomb number two.. Because the acai was SO COLD it actually made it difficult to eat because I kept getting brain freeze. Bomb number 3..the acai was EXTREMELY watery. So watery that as the acai was melting it was almost like I was drinking a watery fruit juice. All in all I probably will not be returning to this location and will give the Bay Ridge location a shot since there are so many great reviews. Very disappointed. I gave it two stars because the staff was friendly.

206,ZQJar03Q1n0oWgGA3ip3nw,10/1/2021,4 star rating,"There's a lot of skepticism surrounding vegan pizza, with many asserting that plant-based pies aren't the real deal. Screamer's, however, definitively puts this debate to rest. A medium pizza consists of six slices, large enough to share among three (or two very hungry) people. The Clean Slide has a relatively standard base, except that they mostly use specialty ingredients - sesame seed crust, non-dairy cheese, and tomato sauce. The selection of toppings is where things get interesting: long hot pepper pesto, broccolini, and seitan sausage form a pie that checks multiple boxes: spicy, veggie-lovers, and ""meat""-lovers. The broccolini's mild sweetness balances out the spice, and the seitan is a solid stand-in for actual sausage. If you've never had vegan pizza before and you aren't sure which to choose, the Clean Slide is your best bet.I opted for delivery instead of takeout, but wouldn't pass up the chance to stop in for a slice or two if I'm near their Manhattan Ave shop. Because it's specialty pizza, Screamer's is pricier than an average slice at your local pizza joint, but in my opinion, it's well worth it."
207,ZQJar03Q1n0oWgGA3ip3nw,9/10/2021,1 star rating,"This was seriously the single worst slice of pizza I have ever had. The pizza was just inedible. Just take a look at my pictures to see for yourself. I took a couple of bites and just had to throw it away, which I never do since I hate wasting any food. I'm hoping this place just had a bad day but I surely won't come back to find out. It is crime to serve such low quality of pizza in New York. Eat here at your own risk."
208,ZQJar03Q1n0oWgGA3ip3nw,11/17/2020,5 star rating,"Love that Screamer's offer vegan pizza - sometimes it's a hit or miss with vegan cheese because of texture and flavor but Screamer's has somehow mastered it. Our group consisted of two vegetarians and two meat-eaters and it was a hit all around. We ordered the Screamer's pizza (named after the restaurant! Of course, had to try it) which came with garlic oil, variety of mushrooms). The crust - by far is the best part of the pizza. It's not overly crispy - it has a good chew and crunch without it being burnt at all. Without marinara sauce, it can be a little too creamy for some but we didn't mind it. The cheese, the longer you wait, starts becoming more gooey so eat it while it's fresh! Will definitely try them again to support a local business!"

My favorite were the buffalo and pepperoni.These slices are a good portion too."

215,ZQJar03Q1n0oWgGA3ip3nw,10/30/2021,5 star rating,"Since I went vegan a few years ago, I've really missed pizza. Most of the vegan slices I've tried weren't even close to real pizza and they just didn't taste right.Enter Screamer's. The pizza is amazing; it's so good in fact that half the time you can't even tell it's fully vegan!!! I tried the regular slice, the white slice, the mushroom slice and they're all amazing. The vegan cheese that is used on their pizza is creamy and flavorful and the crust is really good. I highly recommend trying Screamer's, whether you're vegan or not. It's definitely worth a trip.Keep in mind, this location is very small and there is no indoor dining. There is a bench right in front. There are some drink options that include different kinds of fancy soda. Service is more or less what you would expect at a small pizza shop staffed with teenagers.Highly recommend!!!"

221,DEFteMOu1-bGCs-9bdL6-Q,7/11/2018,4 star rating,"The first time I went to Harlem Blues Cafe, I was a bit thrown off by the owner's demeanor. It felt abrupt. I ordered a mint lemonade and sandwich. The mint lemonade was $4.50 which I thought was too expensive. I was getting ready to pay when the owner said ""go sit."" I was totally thrown off. I said ""but I need to pay."" He said ""fine."" I am a stickler for good customer service so I felt rather annoyed by his demeanor. However, after sometime I realized that the owner had an accent (French, I think) and I've traveled abroad enough to know that sometimes courtesy is perceived differently in different cultures. Just recently, I went back to Harlem Blues Cafe because it near me and I needed a place to work. I'm glad that I did. The owner's demeanor was the same. He told me sit and pay later. I paid at that moment. But I also got to see him interact with other customers and he did the same thing. This time around, I ordered the croissant and it was SOOO good. Nice and fluffy. The owner also came around to offer made in-house roasted nuts. He seemed to know some of the customers who came as well (the regulars).The cafe is spacious which is rare to find in Harlem based on the cafes I have visited. A little overpriced for me, but definitely worth a visit if only for the space and croissant. ;-)"

All I got to say is delicious. If I could pick this place up and move it I would bring it back with me to Portland.

Now I knew this place existed and have been meaning to come back - the first time was a stumble-upon, right at closing - so I figured this would be a good time to go.  When I arrived, it was full, but not crowded, yet it was quiet and the music did all the narrating. I didn't walk in knowing what I wanted, but I knew I came at the right time.I ended up having the Spinach & Fete crepe, with a green mint tea.  How delectable was the crepe, you ask? Well allow me to divulge:  I was quite pleased with the experience. Such a perfect balance of flavor - because too many times in other places, the feta overpowered the dish.  It was so good that I was tempted to order another.  This is not to say that one isn't filling, I just love to eat.  After the dish, I took some time to soak in the atmosphere and just be. Better believe I will be coming back here; most likely every week."

I can't remember the price at the moment, but I believe it was under $15, great portion size, ready very quickly. It was delicious! The lamb was so tender and very flavorful. The green sauce that it came with was a perfect pairing. The vegetables were cooked in a flavorful sauce - see picture. I can't vouch for the falafel, but if this is a good indication of the rest of their menu, I highly recommend paying a visit or grabbing takeout from here!"

Very high quality and reasonably priced wine and food that you'll love eating. Rare find.Because of COVID, the wine list was a little more limited, but anything we tried was really drinkable.The food menu covers a lot of French staples and do them very well (beef bourguignon, croque monsieur, French onion soup, etc.) I can see this being one of my casual go to dinner spots in the area.I had the beef bourguignon and the poulet a la crème (which was my favorite). The meats were so tender and the sauces were so rich. Even though the portions look small, one cassolette to one person is not unreasonable because the food is hearty.The ambiance is really intimate - the lighting is low and it's a smaller spot.

He actually steered me to a different wine that was better AND cheaper. The food was out of this world. The tartare, ratatouille and cheese sandwich were perfect. A super relaxed vibe. Can't wait to come back!!"
238,CsZLG1VpdFAZiT_qRRmJ2A,3/15/2022,5 star rating,"I don't typically seek out wine bars but we decided to stop in after needing a place to seek refuge from the frigid weather. We went around 5 PM on a Saturday and it was busy but not packed which was good as I'm still getting slowly acclimated to dining indoors once again. The wine selection (to me) was fairly extensive without being overwhelming and our waiter made excellent recommendations for those of us who were unfamiliar with wines. We also ordered a combination board with 3 fromages and 3 charcuteries. The choices on the board were all delicious and served with a basket of bread. Definitely a place with a lovely vibe, yummy food, and great service!"
239,CsZLG1VpdFAZiT_qRRmJ2A,1/25/2023,4 star rating,"Good food overall and nice ambiance-- though it is more of a wine bar. Waiters were generous with tartine and bread servings, which were much appreciated. Would come back for a glass of wine!"
240,CsZLG1VpdFAZiT_qRRmJ2A,10/8/2022,4 star rating,"We ended up at the Flatiron's spot as the one in the East village doesn't carry croques and hot meals anymore. Croques were there and good, the marinières mussels were however disappointing. There was almost no broth (see the pic... no more than what was at the bottom) and the mussels were over salty. Also some items missing from the wine list"
241,CsZLG1VpdFAZiT_qRRmJ2A,12/25/2021,5 star rating,"Great wine with great ambience. My friend and I have been here many many times this year. This place is great for wine and small bites. We really come here for the mussels. Both the red and white sauces are good, but we definitely love the white sauce more. You get a huge portion of mussels with bread on the side. Dip the bread in the sauce and it's magic. This is one of our regular spots in the area."
242,CsZLG1VpdFAZiT_qRRmJ2A,2/16/2022,5 star rating,"Great vibes great music great staff. Perfect place to come on any night and enjoy a glass (or glasses) of wine. Wide but not intimidating list of wines and the food looked delicious. Very lively, on a weeknight. Highly recommend"

244,CsZLG1VpdFAZiT_qRRmJ2A,1/7/2020,4 star rating,"4.5 stars only because I haven't tried any of the food menu at Vin Sur Vingt (VSV).As most other reviewers have noted, Vin Sur Vingt is the perfect bar to start or end your night with a diverse choice of wines by the glass and a massive, 250+ bottle wine list in its entirety.  I've stopped in on multiple occasions, usually before going to a big dinner in the area or finishing the evening with the glass of wine I wish the restaurant I had chosen had offered.  The building itself has a bit of a mildew-y smell, which is somewhat unavoidable in some buildings in Manhattan just due to their age or other circumstances, but could be an area of improvement for the wine bar.  Conversely, my friend remarked ""smells like Paris,"" so maybe this is an authenticity issue.  Regardless, the scent is not the best first impression of the bar (and you eventually get used to it).  The bar is never uncomfortably packed and is perfect for someone, like me, who does not see a point in loud, uncomfortably populated bars where no one can hear anything and no one REALLY cares what they are drinking.  There is plenty of standing room and some limited tables in the back, all of which make VSV a perfect, casual, ""stop in for a glass of wine"" type place which can be difficult to perfect.Trust your bartender on their wine selections, assuming that you've come to the French wine bar for some kind preference for French wine.  They have all been knowledgeable and willing to discuss the wines with me.  On the other hand, if you know your wines and what you want already, they likely have both a glass and a bottle to get your fix.  For me, VSV has a bottle of Pinot Noir from Alsace (usually from Willamette Valley, Oregon or other US West Coast areas) that is terrific, and for only $54 a bottle, a steal for a bottle of good wine in NYC.  Paired with a three cheese (sorry, fromage) plate, this is a perfect start to an evening.  VSV has made me a repeat customer for sure and will be my casual bar choice in Flatiron unless something radically changes."

I'm not sure what it is about those teeny little burgers that have made me a fan. I do appreciate the different options of meals that one can choose from. I am a fan of the jalapeño cheeseburger, that little hint of spice takes a lackluster burger to a level of appetizing. I also like to order a side car of cheese for my fries. I think the cheese does have a hint of jalapeño as well.

294,8po0WRavzx7nwwOSXK7Yhw,8/31/2016,2 star rating,"As people have stated in past reviews, the food here is consistent and fulfills the ""craving"". But thats all the good I could say about this place. Employees here are rude and lazy to the point that every time I come here I do not get napkins unless I ask for it! And the drive-thru is a parking lot at anytime of the day. The drive- thru intercom is muffled so you can barely hear the attitude of the employee taking your order. The funny thing is that they are always well staffed so how is it that it takes so long to prepare the food? They are also open 24/7 so that I must say is an added plus, I guess!?!"

305,0cgtOfYGHv3stIZb7C9wHQ,10/13/2013,5 star rating,"Some of the best burritos that I've ever had.  The tortilla is crispy which makes it different from most burritos.  I also love the sauces, the hot sauce is the right amount of spice without drowning out the flavor and the other sauce has a garlicky flavor that's fantastic, although it stays with you all day.The burrito is also large, it's a solid meal but not too huge to take away from the burrito.  I prefer the steak (which is the same as the beef) but the chicken is good too.  The price is right, the burrito is about 6.50 which is prefect for a meal. At another restaurant the same meal could be $10-$12 easily.  The actual restaurant is very basic, but what do you want?  It's essentially a take out place.  The staff are very friendly and helpful despite being constantly busy.  It's also open fairly late into the night closing at 11 I think.  Would definitely recommend this for lunch or an informal dinner.   Especially with the limited options in the area"

The alligator bites are my favorite, I always get them when I come here.The shrimp was cooked a little too much is was a little hard but it was still good. The crab legs are always delicious and the scissor they give you is the best to get into them. The sauce was flavor full and enough to dip in it you would like."
308,1x2hn3e9sCCZca1cnRTpEg,6/17/2022,3 star rating,"I did not try their seafood boil. This review is only for their appetizers/happy hour. I heard so much about their $1 happy hour deal and finally had a chance to try it after monthss of wanting it. The happy hour is the whole day until 7:30pm I believe and it includes $1/raw oysters, $1/plain chicken wings and $1.50/grilled oysters. I came specifically for the raw oysters since I'm an oyster fanatic and I'm always looking for the best places. Fortunately, the oysters were nice cold and fresh. The only problem was their cocktail sauce. It was just not it for me. I don't know what it was about it but I didn't like it. I was so disappointed. It's just not the same without a good cocktail sauce. The waiter said the chicken wings were cajun seasoned, but it was just plain chicken wings to me, lightly salted. The grilled oysters were good, I recommend that but it is a little greasy/buttery. We also tried their creamy seafood pasta. That was good. Overall, I think I just had way too high expectations coming here which led me to be disappointed. I think I would come back to try their seafood boil next time and give their oysters another shot."
309,1x2hn3e9sCCZca1cnRTpEg,4/19/2021,4 star rating,"Such good happy hour deals and great seafood! My friends and I were in the mood for seafood and cajun food and we made a reservation for a Sunday afternoon, right before their happy hour ends at 5. We tried their $1 oysters, $9 adult capri-suns with soju, and their crawfish and shrimp seafood boils. They provide you with gloves, bibs, and hand wipes so that you can keep yourself clean while you dig into the yummy food! $1 OYSTERS (5/5): Super fresh and delicious, even tastier when considering they are only $1 a piece for happy hour!Crawfish Seafood Boil with Cajun seasoning in Spicy (4/5): Solid but I'd rather order a different seafood like shrimp over this one since crawfish is quite small and there is not a lot of meat. The corn was a good addition!Shrimp Seafood Boil in Insane Spicy level (4.5/5): I loved the shrimp-- big and juicy, well seasoned in the sauce. But please do not underestimate how spicy the Insane Spice level is because it is HOT. I can handle my spice pretty well so I thought it would be light work but even I was sweating. It hurt. Still good though.Adult Capri-Suns (5/5): Super yummy and very STRONG. I barely finished mine and I felt buzzed. The Sweet Georgia was my favorite flavor of all the ones we tried: honey citrus fruity soju. Excellent accompaniment to the meal. Overall, the meal was very satisfying and the service was so nice. Everything came out quickly and the vibes were great. I'd definitely come back or even visit their Manhattan location in the LES if I'm craving seafood, especially for their amazing happy hour deals!"
310,1x2hn3e9sCCZca1cnRTpEg,3/29/2022,2 star rating,"The place is hyped up and I'm here to tell y'all the truth. Do not come here for a seafood boil because it's just not it. Coming from a seafood fanatic, this place just doesn't make the cut. But let's start from the beginning shall we? Host experience? 0/10. That's also coming from someone who has held the exact same position. My sister in law and I planned to get some dinner on a Wednesday at 5pm. She ended up making us a reservation for 5:15. I was running late so she got sat before me. Keep in mind, they open at 5. When I arrived at 5:40, no one was at the host stand. From the stand, all you can see is the bar and a doorway leading into what I assumed was the dining room. A young woman walked through this doorway about 2 mins in to me arriving to greet me. This was 2 days before 3/7 so the vaccination mandate hadn't been lifted. I showed her my cards and then she started to walk me over. Immediately I noticed that the place was empty. So I was really surprised that we were sat smack dab in the middle of a bunch of empty 2 tops except for the 2 people right next to us, when she could have easily sat us in a corner, or a booth. So after putting my stuff down, I asked my sil why we didn't get a booth or a corner and she tells me that she did ask but was declined and was even given a hard time over being sat with the ""entire party not being present."" For a party of 2 in an empty ass restaurant? Weird. Usually that's only done for large groups or when a restaurant is overbooked. Again, weird.I walked back over to her and asked if she could accommodate us with a booth. I have a huge pet peeve with sitting with my back turned to the open. There was only one other party of 2 seated inside of the very first booth and the party of 2 next to us. For some reason, she tells me she can't accommodate my request because booths are only for 4 people. Okay.. so I mention the 2 people inside the first booth. She tells me that's her manager and a new hire. Okay. So now I'm annoyed. Y'all literally just opened, it's empty as hell and it's not like this place is going to be packed on a Wednesday, would it have really killed her to give up a booth? I mention this to her and she pretty much tells me that it's not going to happen. I could tell she just wanted to say no. That set the tone for the entire dinner if I'm being completely honest. Not to mention, we left around 8:30-9 and not one 4 top came in after us. So she did all of that for nothing.Service was extremely slow. For a place that small? If your servers can't handle 3-4 tables at a time then you need to find better servers. Everything took forever to touch our table. We had to go searching for him every time we needed something. Although he was extremely sweet, our server definitely needed some work but I forgot his name. The drinks were on point, but again, took extremely long. I remember thinking to myself ""the bar must be packed"" but when I went to use the bathroom, I saw that clearly wasn't the case. They just couldn't handle it. On a slow Wednesday. So I can only imagine what it's like on a weekend. Now for the food. The grilled oysters were my absolute FAVORITE and it was my first time trying oysters in general so I was very happy with that. They were extremely flavorful and the happy hour prices are just great. After walking out, we both agreed that we would come back just for the oysters and drinks but maybe not this location because of the service. The seafood boil was not worth it. Their menu doesn't have many combo options for the boils. Only the ""Seafood boil for one"" which is what we both got. It comes with 1/2 lb of snow crab, mussels and shrimp. The mussels were not good quality and undercooked. Extremely mushy and soft. The sauce was probably my least favorite concoction out of all the boil spots I've tried. The table was also super small compared to the amount of food we had on our table. Honorable mention for the deviled eggs, if they added seafood to it, they would be bomb. This is the truth about this place y'all, I would never steer y'all wrong."

I am from California so grew up on Boiling Crab and thought their sauce was the best I had had, but now the Claw Daddy's Special sauce is by far my favorite. I even asked to take my leftover sauce home to try to cook some of my own shrimps in it. I have been here several times since and it never disappoints. The shrimp seafood boil with Claw Daddy's Sauce is a must-order here. Other foods that I really enjoyed here were the grilled oysters (only $1.50 for happy hour) and the jambalaya. The drinks are a great price for happy hour, though they are a bit too strong for me -- it's good to know you're getting your money's worth."

Food for 3: 1lb of Snow Crab Legs w/ Original Cajun sauce and mild spice, Potatoes & Sausage - 1lb of Snow Crab Legs w/ Garlic Butter Sauce & Corn - 1lb of Snow Crab Legs, 1lb of shrimp w/ Garlic Butter Sauce Spicy - 1 dozen Oysters.Drinks: Mardi Gras Mocktail, Just A Dream Mocktail, I like Beer, still drink beer...Verdict:  Love the East Coast version of the cajun restaurant.  The intense and savory flavor of the seafood is something worthy of coming back for on a monthly occasion.  Opportunity For Improvement: Shuck the oysters when ordered.  Fresh oysters are worth the wait...  Worthy of another Visit?  Yes.  If I was local I would be there a minimum of every 4 weeks."

Every piece of our dinner service had a very long wait.. lobster bisc was good.. ceased salad had to much salt in some parts. But definitely was a great amount. Full lobster was a bit under cook to my liking. The sauce (claw daddy's) need so work. It wasn't a hit.

I've been ordering and going here for years but this is the LAST time I'll ever order from them again. I ordered food a couple days ago and after eating almost all of it, I found a huge fly inside one of the rolls. When I called to complain, they had the nerve to say they'll repay me back with a new order. Why would I want any food from you after I seen a bug rolled up in my food. Luckily it broke apart or I would've never knew there was a fly in there. This place should get closed down."

Always fresh, and their sauces are amazing - they just make rolls so much more special. Snow Mountain roll is my favorite, so as Kiwi. From appetizers, shumai and spring rolls are good choice (again, with perfect sauce to pair!), Mango kani salad is good, but not always consistent, I guess depending on a chef. They deliver, too, and often have specials running on rolls. Most of the times I order a take-out instead of eating in, so I cannot comment on dining service, but delivery service is fast."

I will confess to not being fully hungry when we came here for lunch, but on a cold day the fragrant tofu mushroom clay pot really hit the spot. There is a distinct herbal flavor that I found refreshing compared to similar single-note vegetarian clay pot dishes that I've had in the past.The real highlight of the meal, though, was the elegantly-served Vietnamese coffee, with a generous reserve of condensed milk."
327,f_OiLWqldSmNy1MAvtWlPQ,3/20/2022,4 star rating,Cozy spot with plenty of outdoor seating as well. We came by on a relatively hot day so neither of us wanted to get the pho but we tried:- tilapia vermicelli 8/10: the tilapia was indeed freshly fried but seemed a little toooo fried. The portion size was quite reasonable and the sauce was great- clay pot chicken 8/10: i enjoyed the mildness of this dish but might not be for you if youre looking for something a bit more stimulating. Chicken was also quite tender

My sentiment remains the same... But I will focus on todays delivery experience. The pho is extremely overpriced. I know it's in LIC but it's absolutely ridiculous. The portion is down right disrespectful. They have the audacity to give not even a fistful of noodles?! I attached a picture to show how small the portion is. And they have the option to add ""extra"" noodles but of course at a cost... ($1.50 more to probably not even still make up how much a normal portion should be) The taste itself is nothing spectacular either... I need to stop ordering from here out of desperation to find some good pho in the LIC/Astoria neighborhood..."

But as for Peaches service was probably the best part of this spot. Impeccable. Very helpful server and the hostess was lovely.As for the food, the chocolate cake was subpar and did taste a little stale/old. I masked it with the fresh fruits and the ice cream that was probably some basic grocery store frozen food isle carton. I would skip it. The portion was great, otherwise it just was not very good.I actually liked the mac and cheese which took me aback. There was an oniony taste to it which I liked quite a lot. And the cheese pull was spectacular. The pasta had a little bite to it which was great texturely. I would suggest this item for sure.All the food came out at once which I don't think was the best move because the ice cream was half melted by the time I'd gotten partly through my mac and cheese. Made me feel a little rushed to finish my mac so that I could avoid drinking ice cream soup. I don't know if there was any air conditioning but it got very hot in the space. If there were other items on the menu I was into I think I'd give it another shot but it's probably best to avoid dessert."

The distinction comes out in the taste of the food.To start- Rum punch taste like a bad fruit punch from grocery store.Collard Green's are good, not great, lack flavor.Mac n Cheese is basically cooked noodles in a cast iron pan with cheese melted on top of it, say what?Sad as a local, I won't be coming back.

Normally the croquettes come with a black bean salad that is so good and compliments the croquettes and then when you add the aioli it all just goes together so we'll !! But this meal i ordered was missing the salad which in-tale makes my meal dry and just undesirable to enjoy the way i wanted to !! I finished my meal but i wasn't thrilled about it !!  Quick note : as an avid Peaches Patron it would be nice if y'all take the care into your takeout orders like the sit down orders cause this was very lack luster  SB: the guy who answers the phone is so lovely and inviting with his phone demeanor

My French toast was killer, and my grits and eggs were perfect. Bacon fried to complete crispy heaven! I had three drinks and I could of honestly kept drinking.

345,OYKNRBU-unLF-r0bRZwY3A,9/11/2022,3 star rating,Service needs serious work and food isn't that good. They don't take reservations (except for parties 10+) for brunch. Rather than be sensible and have a waitlist on arrival try just ask guests who was next. An hour wait later and we were seated. They gave completely done away with social distancing leaving about 3 inches between tables. Our waitress came to take our order fairly quickly the first time but after that it was near impossible to hail her down. She messed up my friend's order such that she had to add a side of grits later. Grits were a horrible puréed mess that we 100% should have done without and it was again too difficult to get the waitress's attention about this. Yes partially bc she was busy but also would hang at the front of house when she wasn't. I got the chicken and toast. Chicken was well seasoned but oddly had a lot of fat and extra skin. Toast was a bit dry but good and I liked the fresh berries. I tried my friends house potatoes and they was probably my favorite. I told our waitress early in the meal we were celebrating my friends birthday and we saw several other tables receive a happy birthday ding hug hers never came so we asked for the check and left. The hospitality is certainly missing from this southern spot. I would not return.

Play pen is routy and sometimes it's even hard to find a spot to sit and eat. But overall it's a decent establishment and the employees seem to have well made manners. Other then that everytime I go there I see the same customers it's almost like they live here geez Louis. They have Apple Pay so that's good, it does take too long to even do a mobile order some times therefore it defeats the purpose of making a mobile order. It does have its quiet but moments but the worst of it all is the drive thru. Endless lines of cars filling up till the side of the street you can barely hear what the employees are saying in the microphone and it's like I said before, too many customers not enough workers."

Bartenders have always been friendly.When I've come here it's usually been later when we want to play a game of pool. There is always  a list and it can take a while to play. Sometimes when I've come the pool players love their game and take it very, (way too) seriously - I can usually diffuse competitiveness by making it clear I'm a rookie but there are some who definitely are regulars and take their game seriously here. A typical scenario: I approach the pool table to write my name. See some friendly faces and some guys very clearly into the game giving ""the look"" as I approach their competitive arena - you know, like ""who's taking me on..."" Recognizing ""the look,"" my thought: ""ey - chillax - it is just a bar game and lives will not be lost; can't we all just get along."" My typical approach is to ask who's playing next and then ask that person if it's going to be a friendly game if we play because I'm a rookie and just there to have fun. "" It has ALWAYS  been a fun friendly game, never any drama, and usually among the best regular players are coaching me on and cheering in their cool tough way when I make awesome IPA inspired  (lucky) shots . All good - not there to steal anyone's game or thunder . They also have IPAs I like.Added bonus: one of the only bars open Christmas night."

It is almost becoming a unique gem in the Upper East Side as more and more dive bars are disappearing here. I can tell from coming here multiple times over the past few years that there are die-hard regulars here. It really is a great spot for some casual beers and sports watching. The bartenders and owners are super nice and friendly. Drinks are inexpensive. They don't sell food which is kind of great because you are then free to bring in food from elsewhere (like the burger joint down the block or some good New York pizza)! For entertainment outside of sports watching, they have a pool table in the back and some darts. They also sell Brady's shirts in which proceeds go to charity which is super awesome. I definitely have great respect for this place and hope that this place stays as the neighborhood dive bar."

They have a dart board that is free to play which is fun and the tables are giant barrels which adds to the fun atmosphere. Kind of grimy, but again, adds to the charm/feel of the dive-y ness of it! It is a dive bar, after all! The bar tenders are all really friendly, and the crowd tends to be too! It's a pretty small space though. Pretty sure they don't offer food or anything like that. Also not wheelchair accessible! There's a small step to get in."

My family came to town to visit so one of my cousins thought it would be cool to bar hop on the Upper East Side, more so on Second Avenue. I am more of an East Village kind of person, and I knew the bar scene here would not be as lively as my fave neighborhood.  Boy was I right. The crowd here is older, which means music from 2000, which they probably thought was ""hip."" Singles at the bar watching the game and sipping their beers. I think I saw an empty pool table toward the rear end of the bar. Bartenders eating fro-yo and serving customers. The only thing I enjoyed was my $6.50 tequila cranberry, because it was $6.50. After one drink, we decided to head over to East Village.This is just not my type of scene."

It has its hit or miss nights just like any other local bar , perhaps I happen to walk in on one of their definitely Missed nights .After hitting up the other local spots that are known to be a little more alive on a Thursday night , they too were dead so we decided to go back to hombres since its right around the corner from my apartment .  We walked in to what appeared to be a contest for ""mrs tequilazzo"". Don't know what that title means or what one obtains with such honor but it must be something really big because everyone surrounded the packed stage listening to an old drag queen , read contestant scores , crack a couple of bad jokes , shut people up because she was talking and running the show. Silly if you ask me . So for those us who don't follow or partake in such hobbies we were really turned off . No music , no dancing, no good vibes . Just cheers and chants from the crowd. Just when you think it doesn't get worst ,the time that they do have to play music , they choose to play the saddest, most depressing music one would want to hear at home alone with a glass boxed wine and and old cat . Who ever there dj is he must be fired immediately because of His lack of judgment and Bad,bad song selection  I can only imagine the amount of money this bar lost by hosting these silly shenanigans . Not only are people walking out but those that are there aren't spending money. Blah to top it off the restroom are a complete disgust, no soap , no hand towel, no hand dryer and filthy toilet paper everywhere SO GROSS. This place needs to seriously needs to reconsider who they have running this place because at this rate this place is either going to be shut down by the health department or go broke."

I was originally at IHOP but left because it was packed with kids since school was out that day. Angies was busy but not overly crowded. I sat at the counter and enjoyed my order of eggs with cheese, grits, turkey bacon, toast and hot tea for a whopping $6. I didn't wait long for my meal at all. It looked like they also get a lot of phone orders because that phone was ringing off the hook. I felt very comfortable and homey in their little diner.Now to the food, it was just okay. I tried my best to spruce up my grits but just couldn't get it right. LOL. Next time I will order the home fries. I saw this big carton of juice one of the servers was pouring into a small cup and asked what it was, and she said ""oatmeal juice."" I screwed up my face like omg and then decided to try it. LOL That ""oatmeal juice"" wasn't too bad. Next time I will try a full cup because it did have a little kick to it. The staff were super friendly and this place definitely seems like a neighborhood gem where the staff knows their regulars and vice versa. I heard so many customers calling the staff by their first names which was cool. I will definitely be back for some other breakfast items and to try some more of that ""oatmeal juice."""

The food is not super amazing but sometimes it comes out fast without any major issues.  My only complaint is that service can be a little sluggish at times.

The chickens savoriness paired beautifully with the sweetness of the marinara sauce that just kept me wanting bite after bite! I primarily came here for breakfast so for a lunch item to be the thing that blew me away is the reason why this gets three stars instead of the four.

My friend asked for 3 eggs over easy and only had 2. We where upset by this time and decided we wanted a refund. It took 20 mins to process that.

Despite having reservations, we still had to wait a bit which was somewhat of an annoyance but the hosts were really nice. They took our coats and checked them. It annoyed me more that the other guests waiting for tables were not considerate of others. There are very few chairs on which you might be able to sit while waiting for your table and some of these people were literally on top of us, with their bags and bodies far too close for my comfort. If you're near strangers, the least you could do is to respect their personal space and quite preferably, not touch them.When our table was ready, we were lead to the dining room. They have so much space and they utilize it well. I loved our table. It was in a quiet corner where we could have some conversation and enjoy our meal while socially distant.Our server and all of the staff that assisted us were extremely pleasant. They made us feel very comfortable and welcomed. We enjoyed a tasting menu and I had a wine pairing. All of the food was exceptional. The complimentary bread puffs were to die for. I loved all of it. We had a wonderful night and I would to go back. This is definitely a splurge worth every penny."

I love my man and we are both fans of Tom Colicchio. My man had the pear Japanese  whisky cocktail and said it was the best cocktail ever, I tried it and also loved it. I got the tomato martini which was pricy at $25 but it was really amazing! The flavor really surprised me, just a subtle hint of tomato. The people eating at the bar next to us all had food that looked delicious. This one man was eating creamy soup with the most delectable soft cheese bread of some sort. I really wanted a bite! Chill, trendy servers and really beautiful decor. I will definitely be back for dinner.UPDATE, came back again and got the tomato martini and celery root soup to spit with my man! Martini was even better than the last.Soup was silky and delicious. I will try to make it at home."

We went for lunch at an odd hour (2:30pm) on a Saturday and was able to get seated at a table right away with no reservations.They started us off with a blueberry tomato foccacia. I loveee warm bread. It was an interesting (and surprisingly delicious) flavor combo. The blueberry/tomato was actually very subtle.We got the beef tartare appetizer. It was not the traditional steak tartare, but this version was very well made & flavors are balanced. I came here because I heard amazing reviews about their tavern burger - and yes it's good. One of the best burgers I've had. Besides the fact that it is well cooked, I appreciate all the fine details to this burger. They crisped up the bottom bun so it didn't get too soggy to hold from all the delicious juices that seeped out of your medium-rare patty. The potato chips are also suuuper thin. Came with a smokey relish-type sauce... I wasn't sure if it was meant to dip my chips in or if I was supposed to put it on my burger, but it tasted great on both lol. I'm pretty sure they smoked the sauce too.We ended dessert with vanilla beignets. I had gotten it because it was different than the traditional NYC dessert. I will say that this was 10/10 delicious, but idk I feel like it's an overpriced dessert lol. Waiting staff was wonderful.Ambiance 10/10.Amazing one Michelin star restaurant.

405,veq1Bl1DW3UWMekZJUsG1Q,3/14/2023,5 star rating,"I chose to  visit on a solo date while visiting NYC. Because I was alone, I made a reservation for the more casual tavern area, and opted out of the area offering the tasting menu. The cocktail list is straightforward and approachable. Being an Indiana native, I was pleased to see the only non NY beer offered was Three Floyds Gumballhead, which is a classic hoppy IPA. The atmosphere is warm and cozy. It makes you feel welcome while still being elevated. Service was great, as I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. Not being super hungry, I went staight for an entree and chose the Grilled Black Bass over parsnips and a smoked oyster chowder. The first bite was pure bliss. Flavors expertly balanced and it had just the right touch of salt. I do wish the skin on the fish was slightly more crisp, but it didn't take away from the overall dish. This was a lovely experience and I would definitely come back again solo or with a group."

I ordered the Parma Benedict (Brioche, cheese, prosciutt, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce) it was with a side salad and roasted potatoes. The Benedict it self was good, although there was not enough sauce, and I swear to you, there were only 5 potatoes on my plate... small fingerling potatoes... for a meal that cost over $20, I was expecting more. The service was good, and staff were friendly."

I got the duck & waffle ($18) and a mimosa ($12). If you want a refill it costs ($5). My friends got the prosciutto Benedict ($19) and crab cake Benedict ($20). The portion size was pretty big and I was pleasantly surprised. The waffle was soft and they gave me a decent size duck leg. The eggs were still runny and they have the syrup on the side. The mimosa and bellinis were good here, can definitely taste the champagne. Overall it was a good spot for me and my friends to enjoy a nice brunch."

No customer deserves to be talked down to!!She forgot to give us our check.  When we asked a second time, her response was....completely unprofessional and downright unacceptable. The owners/manager better train their staff to speak to all guest with respect. We demonstrated respect for their profession by leaving a decent tip in spite of the very poor service.  Btw, I rarely write reviews on the same day but this one deserved it. Foodies, there are so many good Italian restaurants in this area with much, much better service."

Was actually heading to another nearby Italian restaurant but noticed the menu outside, liked it, went inside, liked the vibe and so ate here.  Was so happy that I did, best food I have had in Manhattan in a long time. Wanted vegetarian so had the artichokes, rapini and rosemary potatoes.  Best potatoes and rapini I have ever had, and I eat a lot of potatoes.  Sublimely seasoned, not too much salt, the rosemary permeated the entire small potatoes somehow.  Ate at the bar and the bartender had a great vibe and the entire ambiance of vibe of the restaurant was warm and inviting.  Wow, going back every time in NYC."

I could visualize the chef cook the chicken straight from the freezer on to the pan . There was one fried onion ring and some slaw with mayonnaise and no salt.

There's plenty of outdoor seating right now. It's spacious and people are generally pretty spread out. I can't speak to the food here, but the coffee is awful. They also can't make an Americano....which is about all you need to know about their coffee offerings. There are much nicer spots at this intersection, but Soho Park consistently has seating availability (for a reason). Come for the location and the convenience.$10 credit card minimum."

I hardly ever write poor reviews at a place but I couldn't have had a more disappointing experience. I only came here because it was 4pm and most restaurants around were closed until dinner. A girlfriend and I had high hopes as there was plenty of seating but it also looked busy. I ordered the Tuna Niçoise salad and some fries, she ordered the Roast Beef Sandwich. My fries and dish came out about 10 min ahead of hers. The salad was a poor excuse to anything fresh!! Airport food is better than this! The greens were lame, the tuna was from a can, there were about 4 olives, and some tomatoes. The sandwich was a ""like a philly cheese steak out of strip mall In Nebraska"" the meat tasted bad, the cheese was gross, the bread was unpleasant... she only ate half... I didn't dare try a bite it looked so unappetizing. When we asked the waiters for aioli or ketchup, or to wipe the table they literally glared at us!!! Overpriced and unappetizing. Save yourself the money and the stomach ache later! We both had stomach aches after and wasted $30 each on the dish fries and a pepsi."

Lately they have been missing the mark on food quality, the service is always good. My review is only on the food and how it's served. I ordered a western omelet on a butter roll. Well here's what I got;  very stale roll with no butter, the western omelet looked like throw up. They couldn't even take the time to scrabble the omelet. It's obvious they cracked the eggs and threw every in. Let me remind you my omelet has no cheese that's just the lack of care of scrambling the eggs and Cooking the food. That alone makes me question the kitchen, and the care of food that's ordered. In the end the whole sandwich was a disgusting mess, the half and half container was filthy and I was out the money I spent."

""Due to credit card fees""Meaning, If you choose to pay with your credit card there is no opportunity to add a tip to the receipt.So your 5$ tip is going to run you almost $10 if you choose to use the ATM that is conveniently placed by the entrance.

I was expecting to get much better service as we get at the Annadale Dinner (affiliate). This dinner needs improvement with its service, without a doubt, My client ordered ""Grill chicken over salad"" no where in that sentence it said pork.. but we did get bacon bits chopped up in the salad. The order took not only forever to come out.. I had my Cheeseburger deluxe much faster.. both items needed to be grilled. He customer changed order and then asked for ""Grilled chicker over rice"" that came out right but took forever! ""sorry"" the waiter said again. We didn't stay much long as we needed to get going & couldn't stay.. we paid & left. The food I ordered didn't have any problem & it came out perfect. I did order a 2nd dish to take home (hence the 3rd star). I hope my next visit will be worth the trip."

It's good for casual meals like wraps and salads (more on that in a minute) but they also have really great dinner entrees like lamb chops and steak. Sounds crazy but the entrees are better than many restaurants. The dinner entrees are about ~$30 but well worth it. It comes with a soup or salad, entree, dessert and coffee. Some of the entrees, like Chicken Carbone, are big enough to share. I recommend getting chicken Carbone with rice as a side. Their weekday breakfast and lunch specials are great - very reasonable. The star of the show are really the salads. I love their salads and each comes with a robust amount of grilled chicken, if you get the chicken."

I ordered two rolls for $13.95 and they tasted so average. The rice was cold, flavorless, and overcooked. The fish had no taste. It was quite disappointing. And the eel on one of the rolls was extremely salty. However, the reason I give this place 3 stars is because their appetizers are awesome. They are also buy 1 get 1 free. I ordered the Hawaii island which is basically and assortment of salmon, tuna and yellowtail mixed with lettuce and avocado with their house sauce. It was really good with generous portions of avocado and fish. The Star Wars salad was fried shrimp with avocado and lettuce which was also good. Both appetizers only cost $8.95. Also, my mom really enjoys their mixed tempura udon. Their tempura is crispy but I cannot comment on the udon noodles. Overall, I come here only when my mom wants udon and I am forced to eat their subpar sushi."

I seen Lenwich before in lower Manhattan but never went as everything now a days is too expensive. Walking in here I was a little overwhelmed as they had a lot to choose from with pictures so the hunger definitely kicked in. The lady at the register was very friendly and professional. I ordered some steak sandwich(may have been the cheese steak) and a carrot/ginger soup (I never order soup). The sandwich on Brioche bread was very good and the soup omg was sooooo good. I was upset I ordered a small. The place was clean and all the staff was friendly. Yes the meal (without a drink) cost me a little over $10 but was it worth it? Hell yes it was. Definitely will return if in the area.

I love sandwiches, and nothing beats a Publix sub (though I haven't had one since I moved to NY), but this place comes pretty close! They give you a generous amount of ""stuff,"" and it tastes fresh. I'm a weirdo and don't like mayo or mustard in my sandwiches, and would rather have it ""dry."" I've come to find that there are varying degrees of dry, based on the type of bread and meat. Some sandwich shops are so dry that I'm basically choking on it if I'm not downing water. But Lenwich has the combo where the meat is juicy enough for it to be eaten by itself without any beverages (although why would you want to bc you're making your saliva glands work extra hard). Other than that, there's really nothing else I judge a sandwich on!"

Anyway...I love this place. They have salads. People go and eat these said bowls of lettuce. They have sandwiches. They have bagels. This is how I stumbled upon this great place, getting a bagel and then letting my eyes dance across the menu to the best thing ever: The Lenny's Fishwich. O.M.G.Let's start by saying that it's very hard to find a good fish sandwich almost anywhere outside of Bed Stuy, at least not in a pub (where you would pay close to $15), so when I saw that they served a proper fish sandwich, not tuna, on brioche..omg, I almost fainted. The sandwich can be served on any bread, but get the brioche...along with lettuce, tomato and tartar sauce..they add a beautiful layer of potato chips. Potato chips. Potato chips to the top. It's heaven. Did I also mention they serve fries? The fries are sooo good and cooked to order and is served in a huge paper bag. I actually need a Lenny's intervention. I do. I've planned not to visit this location for a long while because I know the people who work there too. That can't be good right? Especially when I have never bought a salad!!!"

It's raining and the sign outside said 99 cent coffee.Any size was 99 cents i wasn't even taxed.The female associate who assisted me was nice and pleasant.She made my coffee correctly.The coffee itself tastes great especially for the price. I would come here over dunkin donuts just for the coffee.I have been sitting in here for about half hr drinking my coffee. It's not overcrowded. It's not overly noisy. Pretty pleasant atmosphere.

486,2DJjJu3sqaBCN7w4CwR5Dw,2/19/2017,5 star rating,"I have found my new favorite bar! I would live in this place if I was a resident of downtown Brooklyn. We were bar hopping since we only had one night in the area, but loved this place and my drink so much that we came back for our night cap. When we returned there were 4 bar tenders instead of the three earlier. The vibe coming from this place is fantastic. It seems inconspicuously tucked away, because it has a great little porch before the entrance. The front wall is a large door and huge windows with seating on both sides. When you enter you will see there are multiple options for seating with five high tables and a concrete bar that stretches the length of the space. In the back is more seating and another small outdoor space. The lighting is uniquely industrial. I drooled over the large circular antique mirrors that balance the wall behind the bar. They play a mix of music that I appreciated. The bar tenders were very friendly, had great smiles, and fast for creative cocktail place. They were good at multitasking as would make a drink and take your order at the same time. They had an impressive cocktail, beer, wine and food list.  The prices are normal for a nice cocktail bar. I sipped on, well tried to sip on, the Corner stone. It was a red currant infused vodka with cognac, fresh lemon, cherry jam, topped with Prosecco. I am a sucker for a cocktail topped with Prosecco. My hubby enjoyed the local gin with tonic. Since we were only staying for one round and nibble we opted for the deviled eggs. They were scrumptious. We liked addition of frishee greens, pickled fennel (?) and green sauce. We saw another table get the veggie sandwich which we were eyeing on the menu and it looked delicious as well. The people  who got it didn't leave a crumb on their plate so I think I can assume they enjoyed it."

492,2DJjJu3sqaBCN7w4CwR5Dw,11/5/2017,5 star rating,"There happens to be a staggering number of figures in early American history named Robert Livingston, all of whom are bound by knots in the blood. The town for which this bar is named, as well as the street just beyond, are both named for Roberts Livingston, who were cousins and contemporaries, yet not the same person. One ruled over an anachronistically feudal estate in the Catskills; the other was the master mason who swore in George Washington as the first president, a singular act marking the beginning of centuries of uniquely American paranoia.The Livingston bloodline tangles into those represented by many other New York streets: Bleecker, Cortlandt, Clinton, Van Ness, and so on and so forth, concrete threads of conspiracy. Outlandish legends readily spread of a population of escaped crocodiles making their home beneath them, as well as of lizard-like beings secretly controlling American politics while wearing human skin. Such stories seem absurd until we remember that the reptilian cortex underlies all of our higher brain functions; that every supposedly rational belief of man is built atop the thrashings of a terrified, skull-shelled tortoise. That being said, the Illuminati are real. You can often find them on commuter planes between LaGuardia and Logan, as well as throughout the Under East Side, holed up in bars run by the troglodytes of antiquity. These establishments are torchlit and densely-packed, accommodations intended to compensate for their ectothermal nature. There they decide on the taxes in blood that each earthly nation shall pay while devouring handfuls of tempura-battered cigarettes like popcorn.Fortunately, this is not an Illuminati bar. There are no exchanges of mermaid fingernails for drinks, no ice blocks congealed from the tears of endangered species. This is a place for the warm-blooded.Weaving spiders come not here."

We were meeting some friends before a movie at Alamo, and needed a place to unwind before we went in. We could have, of course, gone to house of wax (which is an OK bar in its own right, and is located inside Alamo), but wanted something different that night. They suggested Livingston and we agreed. Happy we did, as we found a new spot that we will be sure to return to. Walking up, its hard to miss how dramatically the neighborhood is changing. Huge new residential buildings are really taking over, and its starting to feel a lot more like downtown Manhattan than ever before. Leaving aside if this is a good thing or not, it really is interesting to see how Livingston fits in. The space doesn't feel new (like its neighbors), but it also doesn't feel out of place. Its cool that a place like this can fit in so well in a space that is so fluid. The bar dominates the interior (as you might expect...at a bar), but there are plenty of tables and booths to be had (not a bad choice for a larger group). The staff was friendly enough, and their HH beer prices are not bad at all for what might be considered a pricey neighborhood. I didn't try a cocktail, but the one's I saw being made looked pretty solid. The bar was pretty full on the Friday we went, but considering the options of the neighborhood, that wasn't really surprising. That said, if you're coming with more than four, I'd make an effort to get here early for one of the larger tables. If you're really lucky, you can grab one of the small tables outside (and if you sit long enough, a new building might spring up in front of you...)All in all, this place is a solid call; I've no doubt this will be my new go to if I'm in the area."

Decent food, decent drinks, decent prices, but nothing that left me with the urge to head back.Quality: Livingston Manor is a pretty standard bar. Falling somewhere between cocktail and dive, it serves up drinks and a limited food menu. I went with a few beers from the happy hour selection. Nothing crazy, but a few local options and okay variety. I also shared a Meat & Cheese Board. They leave the compilation of your three selections up to you. We went one cured meat, one soft cheese, and one hard cheese. The options constantly change, which adds some variety. What came on our board was good, though I think they could have made it look a bit prettier.Quantity: A fair sized Meat & Cheese Board and solid beer pours.Value: $26 for a Meat & Cheese Board. $2 off Draft Beers during happy hour, leaving most options between $4 and $6.Ambiance: Livingston Manor is found along an alley in Downtown Brooklyn. They have a tiny patio outside, which was occupied by smokers our entire visit, and then a decent sized indoor area. The bar sits on the left wall, while high tops spread around the front space. The back area of the bar is a bit more cozy and private. A mix of brick, concrete, and wood, industrial accents, and a classic rock playlist should all be expected. Unfortunately, nothing that really stands out.Crowd: A good sized crowd for happy hour. Always a few seats available, but busy enough and a fun group.Service: Quick and helpful service. Appreciated the bartender who went out of his way to get us drinks even after we moved to a table.Parking: No easy parking in the area."

Came here for happy hour and was pleasantly surprised. An excellent array of beers, cocktails, and wine. All at an excellent price. Playing some good tunes, sippin on some whiskey, and hanging out with my girl, I couldn't be happier. Happy Hour does get a little crowded so make sure you come a little earlier to find your nook. I still would like to come by and check it out at night, I've heard great things. Maybe you should too."

I did finish the meal but was slightly offput.  This place is not cheap $18 a glass of wine, so I expected some gratis item taken off dessert etc.  When I received the bill it was full price. I spoke to the owner on the way out and his response was ""It happens"".   WTF????I guess he is doing well and has no need for customer service. I am not a high maintenance customer, but this sort of arrogance bothers me. I have never written a yelp review."

Except this is right in our backyard in Park Slope! Add in a cappuccino and a pastry? Bellissimo.They've got a few tables outside (sidewalk seating for those with dogs!), and a nicely-sized, bright and airy interior. Owners are extremely friendly, and are always there. I've also come in once for lunch and had a lovely prosciutto panini, served with roasted red peppers and olives on the side. Also worth noting their olive oil here is the good stuff -- and thankfully, they drizzle it on basically everything (or so it seems?) Anyway, it's so flavorful. Ina Garten would most certainly approve."
498,ddyYKrNWkdc5mudrmLaTvA,9/5/2020,5 star rating,Just amazing. The foods are superb! We had pasta and sandwiches. The pasta was cooked just in right seconds and mushrooms on top really matched it. Definitely one of the best Italian in the city:)
499,ddyYKrNWkdc5mudrmLaTvA,7/3/2018,4 star rating,"I'm totally perplexed by all the 5 star reviews!! I wanted to give Flora 3 to  3 1/2 stars but Yelp doesn't have a half point rating system, so I gave 4 stars which is generous. I wanted this experience be great since Flora is in my neighborhood,  and I've passed by numerous times without stopping in, I should have listened to my intuition. As I entered Flora the waiter was cleaning a table, we made eye contact and I sat down, and waited, and waited....Finally he came over, placed the water carafe on my table and left. Then I waited, and waited again. Finally the owner came to my table and handed me a nenu..The owner is a friendly and attentive gentleman. The owner went to each table to address his customers which is nice. By the way, he's the owner, I inquired.  As I waited for my waiter to finally return to my table, the owner returned and took my order. I explained to the owner I wanted coffee, and the breakfast option on the menu. The owner first returned with my coffee and a small bottle of cream which appeared to be curdled. I attempted to pour, and yes, it seemed  a bit thick for me. I didn't  dare touch it, and I pushed away the feeling I began to experience. Once again, the owner returned with my food. ( where was my waiter?).....Poached Egg, Potato, Prosciutto  Cotto, Asiago  cheese, Bread and one Olive. The white of the poached egg appeared to be a bit runny to me, but I ventured on. After two bites I knew the egg was undercooked for me. One thing about my eggs, have to be fully cooked, even poached eggs must be fully cooked.At this point I knew I should stop. I began to feel nauseous. Then I cut into the Italian ham and cheese, my taste buds were not impressed. I cut into the cold potatoes, was disappointed as well, cold tasteles potatoes not my thing. I thought perhaps the saving grace would be the bread, nope. The bread was drowned in oil and looked like someone ripped it apart with their bare hands. The best thing about my meal was the one freaking olive!!! I explained to the owner( still waiting for my waiter), I would like everything except the egg, to go. The owner offered to cook my egg a bit more, but I was done, I'm fussy about my eggs and just wanted out.  I told the owner it's not him , his food, or the female cook who came over. I was very particular about my eggs. Besides I felt like I was going to be sick and had to leave.I told the owner I'd take two of his pastries to go, (fig tarts), and was at the counter waiting for my bill, when a familiar face appeared, my waiter! The owner rang me up, 30 dollars and change for my breakfast plate, coffee, and 2 tarts. I then placed the tip on my table, which should have been handed to the owner since he ended up being my waiter! Now I have to say, I wasn't going to review Flora due to my experience. I was going to give them another try. However, when I arrived home and opened my "" to go"" container, I was shocked. I'd never seen any establishment thtow all my food into a plastic cup when I ask for my food "" to go"".I cannot recommend Flora at this time, and unfortunately will not be returning. I do want to say thank you to the owner for his attentiveness and friendly demeanor!"

It's probably not a ""let's actually eat"" brunch place because it's main attraction seems to be imported charcuterie and cheese, which is nice but that's not what brunch is about. The food doesn't seem to match the atmosphere or the small, boutique feel. The tables are surprisingly short so it feels like you're drinking tea with Barbie while friendly servers tower over you.The ""uova in camicia"" is your typical brunch vision but there's nothing special ($16). The food portion is definitely not enough.The ""frittata di spaghetti"" is downright strange. I didn't really think it would be the spaghetti pie and that was my mistake to think otherwise. It really is a circular form of bland spaghetti molded by some weird egg magic. If you do want to take this road less traveled, then you're going to have to ask for salt and pepper and bring your own hot sauce because it honestly tastes like you shouldn't have paid $16 for it. The salad underneath is good. Service was wonderful. The tomato sauce has chunks of garlic and that's probably the best part. Coffee was good."

The food is not exactly authentic tasting but it is cheap. Like most of these types of places, they serve stuff like california rolls, chicken teriyaki, udon and tempura.For these sort of restaurants , this place is slightly above average. The place inside is very clean with a mostly wooden interior and several wooden tables, with waiter service. They also have a very cheap lunch special. For $5.15, you can get a lunch entree that comes with miso soup and salad. For the entree you can choose among several things, like a combination of several sushi rolls, or the chicken teriyaki (which also comes with a california roll)."

I had ordered from here before so I knew the food would be good either way.   When he did come, he was so unbelievably rude and over an hour late that I honestly won't be ordering take out from here again.  So to those who want to give it a try, just go and pick up or eat at the establishment but stay away from delivery."

Today the young lady behind the register said I was the 4th person to come in and ask for dressing and complain that they were all out. She actually laughed at the situation. I didn't find it funny. To my understanding the dressing is made at the restaurant. So if they are all out someone just hasn't took the time out to make it. Lazy workers."

About 45 minutes after we ordered, the customers waiting outside started getting really angry, and the security guard finally let us in. Once we were in, people ordered in-person contrary to the security guard. The workers seemed to stop working for a while, with one worker just eating cheese and another pushing the vent above a food preparation area with a broom.

They only have a tasting menu, but I love it because they specialize in a few dishes each time. Although, if you are a picky eater, I would check the menu since it changes every so often. Each dish was amazing - so flavorful and well thought out. You would think that with the size of each dish you would leave hungry, but it was actually quite the opposite.

The ambiance was romantic and the experience was decent but not perfect. The French & Korean fusion food was overall delicious with reasonable portion, especially the 3rd course Chilean Sea Bass. The crust on the top of sea bass was crispy, flavorful and greatly matched with the softness of fish. We could tell from each dish how the chef Soogil cares about what they serve. We were surprised and impressed by the heart shape made from puff pastry on the top of Beef Wellington. However, we were disappointed with their indoor environment. We did the indoor dining reservation due to the low temperature but it was extremely cold and we even needed to have our coat & scarf on while dining."

Basically from dish to dish our waiter kindly explained every single part of it and was very funny/friendly. Service was super speedy and the food always came out on various types of bowls/plates with decoratice elements (one dish was on rocks!) I don't want to rant and spoil it here, but it is by far one of the coolest, fanciest and unique experiences I've ever had. If you have the means, I highly recommend dining here at least once. As a Korean-American who has a father from France, this felt like home. Thank you Soogil for a once in a lifetime dinner with my girlfriend. We were floored and had a perfect night!"

The first two courses were pretty good, a creamy soup and scallops with a salad. I did not like the foie gras - it was too fatty for my taste and I couldn't finish the whole dish. The short rib was perhaps the best food item of the day. My favorite course of the night is the dessert - crispy churros with black sesame gelato. It was the best sesame-flavored ice cream I've ever had and it went very well with freshly fried churros. This one takes the entire meal from a 3 to a 4. Overall the food was good but a little underwhelming. Among all the creative Korean spots I've tried in NYC, I'd recommend Kochi and Atoboy for better food with the same price level, or Hortus as a more affordable option."
535,q-QEwZi32JCnjb7zbY-PQw,2/8/2020,5 star rating,"Soogil's Restaurant Week menu sounded so fantastic that it became my most anticipated visit of the winter season.The question: Would it live up to my expectations?The answer: It absolutely did.Let's start with the appetizers. We got the beef tartare and sprang for the uni ($5 supplement). The beef tartare was great, wonderfully marinated with a refreshing crunch from the Korean pear and pickled chayote. It loosely reminded me of poke. The uni itself had that perfectly creamy, lightly sweet flavor that I was hoping for. The spinach flan was okay, but the cauliflower was very buttery. Too buttery.We both couldn't resist getting the scallops, and while the dish only came with three, they were perfectly seared and tender. The Korean chili paste crust on top, which I thought was actually flavored bread crumbs, added great flavor to the scallops. The sauce was addicting and I found myself trying to swirl up every last bit. The pickled sunchoke slivers were a bit too tart, but they weren't a big detractor.We tried both of the desserts. The Jenga Tower with sesame gelato was a great combination. The pastry sticks (or as I call them, ""chewy Asian churros"") were really fresh and tasty. They went perfectly with the cool, nutty black sesame gelato. The chestnut panna cotta was the real winner though. I loved the layers of panna cotta, and the actual bits of soft, sweet chestnut in the bottom layer. The kumquat sliver on top was juicy and sweet, and the rice cracker puffs added a nice crunch and slightly savory element to the dessert.I'm a little disappointed that I wasn't actually full by the end of this meal, but the flavors and execution were so good that I didn't mind all that much."

Given that it's on 7th Ave that's no surprise, but wasting 15 minutes of my morning for an iced coffee is a little ridiculous (that's 6 mins in line 1 min taking my order and 8 mins waiting for it). The line usually wraps around the store in the morning and not enough employees are on hand to keep up.

552,l7xJlfmn8N4DD1oxfR_rIA,7/22/2021,1 star rating,"Horrible experience at the Starbucks on 6th Avenue and 36th Street. Almost every day for the past month I get a medium coffee with almond milk in the afternoon. The price is $3.21 with tax included. Today, I go into the store and they wanted to charge me $4.08 for the same order. I asked why did the price go up and they said that for 3.21 I can only get a ""splash"" of almond milk. So, I asked to speak to the manager. The manager came out, clearly annoyed that she had to speak to a customer. She wanted nothing to do with me, nor had any desire to help me. I explained my situation. She told me that today (and only today) she would make an exception and charge me $3.21. I gave the associate a $20.00 bill, and he proceeded to give me change back from $4.08. So, now we're back to square one, me trying to explain that it should have been $3.21. At the end, I took my $20.00 bill back and walked out without my coffee. I know that in the big picture this is a small issue, but I simply do not want to deal with employees and/or managers who do not want my business, they don't care about customers. So, now, I will no longer buy coffee at Starbucks any more. I am sure they do not care about losing my business, so I am posting this review to share with others how I feel."

However the staff in the location is terrible , not all of them, but consistently forgot either your drink or pastry , though they will never forget to charge your money. I happened couple times already , and I gave it a shot again thus morning, there are very few guests so there is just no excuse to mess up the order. Guess what , the staff she forgot and she did apologize very casually while chatting with others .  Location wise it is right across my office , BUT I will never stop by this location anymore .  TERRIBLE !!!!"

You suck."

The manager Sam is great, I always order through the app and the servers here are usually very prompt, friendly and accommodating.

I used their restroom to find there was NO soap dispenser and no soap in the bathroom and the roll of toilet paper on the floor. How do the employees wash their hands to serve customers?! I didn't buy anything and am so grossed out.Plus tables or the space still has garbage everywhere. I guess there's no Maid service..........I'd give them zero stars if I could"
592,l7xJlfmn8N4DD1oxfR_rIA,7/22/2021,1 star rating,"Horrible experience at the Starbucks on 6th Avenue and 36th Street. Almost every day for the past month I get a medium coffee with almond milk in the afternoon. The price is $3.21 with tax included. Today, I go into the store and they wanted to charge me $4.08 for the same order. I asked why did the price go up and they said that for 3.21 I can only get a ""splash"" of almond milk. So, I asked to speak to the manager. The manager came out, clearly annoyed that she had to speak to a customer. She wanted nothing to do with me, nor had any desire to help me. I explained my situation. She told me that today (and only today) she would make an exception and charge me $3.21. I gave the associate a $20.00 bill, and he proceeded to give me change back from $4.08. So, now we're back to square one, me trying to explain that it should have been $3.21. At the end, I took my $20.00 bill back and walked out without my coffee. I know that in the big picture this is a small issue, but I simply do not want to deal with employees and/or managers who do not want my business, they don't care about customers. So, now, I will no longer buy coffee at Starbucks any more. I am sure they do not care about losing my business, so I am posting this review to share with others how I feel."
593,l7xJlfmn8N4DD1oxfR_rIA,2/12/2015,2 star rating,Stereotypical Starbucks. Line that wouldn't move because the cashiers were too busy talking to each other or messing up on the order. The people making the coffee were always waiting on the cashiers. After getting my drink I had to have it corrected because the cashier didn't write it down correctly. But the lady making my coffee was very nice and corrected it quickly. This place has potential but I spent 15 min in line and 1 min waiting on my drink. Not a very good flow of service.

From the cashier and the barista to the manager I have never seen people actually cursing customers at a coffee shop. Amazing that Starbucks allows this sort of illiterate and unsavory people onto their team. First thy  forget to make our order then when we ask them what happened , they curse us out for Not asking after our order sooner. The manager did not do anything to correct he situation: instead of offering  an apology, he impersonated a deaf mute mime. Which was better Han the cashier who cursed us to our face. The 2 star rating of this location has to be chalked down to the kindness of strangers"

I'd love to check out drag brunch sometime, though!We ate outside as it was just warm enough to do so, and nowadays we prefer to whenever we can. There were a few other groups outdoors as well, and I think some additional groups eating inside. The service couldn't have been prompter or nicer. Our server seemed happy to offer recommendations and also seemed to genuinely care what we thought of our dishes and drinks. We both started with margaritas on the rocks: Mine was a tasty cream of coconut margarita and my friend's was a spicy version of a classic marg with a hot pink salt rim. Both were good, but I think I'd give an edge to the delicious spicy version, which featured a hot pink salt rim and a noticeable but tolerable spice level from the fresh jalapeno. I ordered the Cubano al Pastor tacos, which comprise tender pulled pork, sweet pineapple marmalade, and a luscious cilantro crema to top it all off. They were great and reasonably priced. My friend got the fajita platter with chicken, which came with rice and black beans, a pepper and onion mixture, and sauce toppings. I tried a few bites and thought the peppers tasted incredibly fresh. I also appreciated the addition of maduros. Love those sweet, sticky plantains to death."

602,zNcDCPiUsE5aT6jyaCVtmA,4/17/2019,5 star rating,"I thought that this would be brunch with a little drag show action on the side. Instead, what we got was a full out drag show with a side of brunch. And ya know what? I'm here for it.The drag show was nearly three hours long, and it was entertaining and impressive the entire time. We were treated to a medley of live song + dance performances, ranging from everything to disco, broadway show tunes and pop. There were props, costume changes and lots of audience interaction to keep everyone on their toes. I was here for a friend's birthday celebration and this was the perfect setting. Oh, and shouts to Gloria Swansong + Golden Delicious who were both pretty darn amazing.Drag show aside, the brunch deal here is solid and the food is tasty. For $35 dollars you get an entree plus a large carafe of either sangria or mimosa. I went with a chicken quesadilla which was cheesy and delicious and came with guac, pico and sour cream. I also opted to order a mojito instead of a carafe and it was super fresh with lots of mint and lime. My only complaint is that it took a long time for our food to come out. We sat at noon and didn't eat until around 1:30. But the ambiance and drag show is so great that it really doesn't matter too much.At the end of the meal they also brought out a cake with sparklers for my friend who was celebrating her birthday which was a really nice touch!If you are looking for a super fun brunch experience with above average food + drinks and an amazing drag show, look no further. Fresco's Cantina is where it's at."

I love Mexican food and I'm always looking for great tacos and elote ""Mexican street corn"". This place did not disappoint. We made a reservation and were seated as soon as we walked in. Our server was very attentive and assisted us with any questions we had. Food came out at a good pace. For appetizer we started out with the esquites al fresco which is Mexican street corn and it was off the cob so no mess! It was delicious the cilantro cream on top really gave it that extra touch of flavor. We then got the chicken flautas ""taquitos"". Came with shredded lettuce tomatoes and sour cream and were nice and crunchy. For entree I got the Phuket shrimp tacos which had sweet chili sauce and were different  then usual shrimp tacos I go for but they were delicious and I added some hot sauce and lime for an extra kick. My sister got the pollo robado tacos which you can choose crispy or grilled chicken. She chose the crispy and it was topped with lettuce tomatoes and cilantro cream which I love. We both exchanged a taco and I was pleased to say I usually don't go for chicken tacos but these were so flavorful and not dry. For drinks we got two henny coladas and they did not hold back on the liquor! All in all great experience,  great food, great service and great location. The place was very warm and welcoming and I heard they do private parties! Definitely would think about doing a Private party here! Thank you guys! It was so worth the travel to get here! Everything was so good I wasn't able to take great pictures since I remembered while already digging in but I did attach the ones I took!"

Wasn't sure how my visit would turn out with Covid and all. It was 8pm and I was praying for indoor seating because it was too cold for any outdoor set up (even with a heated lamp). Lucky for my date and I, the seating was indoors. First, we had to get our temperature taken and then leave our information for contact tracing purposes.We were happy to see that there were barely any people dining at the time. Just one couple. We sat to the back of the restaurant because I figured it'd be super cozy there, which it was (really close to the kitchen, lol). My date and I both ordered stuff from the Specials menu. He had a fried rice beef stew which smelled super delicious (too bad I only eat seafood). I ordered the sautéed shrimp and grilled vegetables with noodles. It was scrumptious and finger licking! I literally cleaned my plate until it almost flipped over on my cute, silk dress. We had two glasses of Merlot which came in big wine glasses but I sure as hell wasn't complaining. The more, the merrier! Man I didn't realize how much I missed Joya's fresh, piping hot dishes. I hope to be back whenever outside dining comes back."

Nothing eccentric but it's definitely worth popping in. Grabbing a bite to match your hunger size and enjoying the energy from the fellow patrons.The location is of moderate size. The backyard seating is a nice touch. It'll have you looking forward to enjoying some summer evening company there."

I had the red curry noodles with chicken as my entree and my bf got the chicken pad thai. I can never choose between curry and pad thai so the red curry noodles were the perfect solution. Sweet curry with the perfect amount of spice and very well cooked chicken and noodles. Chicken pad Thai was very rich and I loved the bean sprouts in them. Also, get mango sticky rice for dessert. Necessary."

We arrived at 7:15pm and were seated outside. The waiter immediately asked us to order, so we got pad thai and spicy noodles. I didn't have time to look at drinks so I ordered a lager, the first thing I saw. We then waited for over an hour as the clouds overhead started to drizzle and then picked up into a steady rain. A father with his son next to us, and I, ran inside to see if there were tables available. They said no. We sat outside, some parties huddled against the sides of the patio where overhanging plants were collecting some of the water and we could stay dry. Our papaya salad collected rain water as we laughed at how ridiculous it is that 2 years into a pandemic and a month after a hurricane, this busy, mid-sized restaurant doesn't have an outdoor set-up.Still, this is NY, and some people were willing to stay outside and continue to eat as the rain crescendoed.After a while, they moved us inside, but it still took from 7:15pm to 8:15pm to receive our noodles. I felt bad for the waiter, who seemed to be the only one serving all the tables. Seems like a management issue for SURE. Added a star for the spicy noodles, which were hot, with fresh vegetables and doughy fat noodles. Papaya salad or som tum - piled high, ripe, decent taste but not esp flavored, some peanuts and cherry tomatoes on a bed of iceberg."

We were thrilled to discover Caviar can deliver to us out here in Flatbush. Placed the order at 6:10pm & it arrived at 6:48, quick! The food was top notch. The spring rolls were a little greasy but they're fried, so of course. The Som salad was crispy & had a lot of dressing pooling at the bottom. The ribs were so darn good! Good crunch, caramelized snap to the bite with moist flavorful meat. The Pad Thai & Spicy Needles were fantastic with both the Red Curry & the Tom Yum Soup which had a powerful spicy flavor."

After moving to SF a few years ago, I make sure to squeeze in at least 1 meal at Joya. My recent trip to Joya was SUCH a disappointment and I finally understand the reasoning behind so many negative reviews. The calamari was all breading and soggy. Our curry dish was cold. The server seemed so annoyed having to serve us and was super unfriendly. He didn't bother to change the dish or just head it up. I don't think I've ever had cold Thai food, but somehow Joya managed to make that happen. I truly hope they listen to the reviews and make some serious changes! My 2 stars are def for the decor and the clean bathrooms."

The food is always fresh and made to order. Another plus,  Joya always has the best dinner specials. Their drink selection is great as well. On this particular outing, I was able to dine outside and I enjoyed that experience. On a block that has many options, Joya is definitely a hit and will remain in my Thai food rotation for the foreseeable future. I highly recommend it."

Just parking outside was really awful because the guy cleaning decided to tell us where we should park since we had a family van. Then he proceeded to stare us down till we went inside. When we were inside, the people that come all the time were served first and when we finally got served our drinks, the dish for the creamer had jam on it. From where? Who knows. The food was okay. Each breakfast set came with coffee and juice so we didn't have to choose between that. I felt like our waitress was much friendlier to the table in the back than to us. Sure, maybe they frequent this joint more than us, but it doesn't mean we deserve any less. Based on the other Yelp reviews for this Diner it looks like there's a lot to work on as far as providing better service to customers."

For a medium they charge $3 and then large is $4 which is a normal small/medium at other coffee shops. I don't drink a lot but even I had to get their ""large"" size for my morning coffee run. They say they use La Columbe beans but the coffee was a bit bland.. I'd rather pay $5 at La Columbe than paying $4 at Corvo. Also, when I make my coffee with oat or almond milk, it becomes around $5 which is pretty much the same as other coffee shops. But even so, I think it's still a pretty cool concept where in NYC they can charge as much as $6-7 for a cup of coffee. And staff here are very accomodating and working hard."

I loved the interior design of the restaurant, very festive? and warm. I ordered the fish katsu and it came with two large fillets, vegetables and rice. It was the perfect portion, not too much, not too little. They also gave me three sauces on the side and I was so happy about that. I love my sauces and many restaurants skimp out on sauce!!! The fish katsu was perfectly cooked, not too oily or too much breading. The vegetables were also great to have on the side to balance out the katsu. The service was also really great. Both the waitress and waiter? bus boy? were so attentive and prompt with their service. I will definitely be back to try their ramen!"
637,O9WmKufAUqDM0j2HpgLVlw,2/11/2023,5 star rating,First time in NYC having ramen. They did not disappoint. Serving size was great and the prices were good. Even had leftovers. Next city trip I will definitely be returning. Yum!
638,O9WmKufAUqDM0j2HpgLVlw,9/26/2022,3 star rating,Came here with friends to try. Since my friend always ordered here for delivery. Might as well try it in person. It's just a normal ramen place. Nothing special about it.
639,O9WmKufAUqDM0j2HpgLVlw,1/2/2022,3 star rating,"Stopped by for lunch with my boyfriend and a few other friends. We ordered takoyaki, ebi potato, a chicken katsu and 4 ramens. My kara veggie ramen was just ok. I'm not a big fan of pork broth and was disappointed that they didn't offer a chicken broth option. For a veggie broth, my kara veggie was light but slightly salty. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food. Not sure if I would return for their veggie broth."

You're seated right away, the order comes out so quick, and they constantly refill your water as needed.I ordered the chasyu ramen which was a big bowl. It comes with extra meat which is a big plus for me. There was also a lot of noodle and not just broth. I can't wait to try other ramen dishes."
641,O9WmKufAUqDM0j2HpgLVlw,1/12/2023,5 star rating,Wow. This is truly one of the best meals I've ever had. I was sick at home and took a chance on this on Uber Eats. Truly some of the most delicious food I've ever eaten. I only wish my stomach was bigger so I could have more. Unfathomably good!!!
642,O9WmKufAUqDM0j2HpgLVlw,5/8/2022,5 star rating,"I ordered through Grubhub and it arrived on time and everything was delicious. Food arrived nice and hot. I ordered the Katsu andPork Bao along with Ramen. The Katsu did arrive very soggy which was disappointing. If you're ordering anything Katsu ask for sauce on the side. That was my mistake for not adding it in the notes. It was still delicious and enjoyable. The Bao was out of this world delicious. The pork was tender, juicy and the bun was so soft and sweet. By far my favorite. The ramen came dried with wet broth separately. It was actually really good. I'd definitely order again and again."

The Champon wasn't spicy even though it was supposed to so I had to ask for more chilli which made it so much better. I gave 4 stars because the mussels in the Champon weren't cleaned (see image) so that was a bit of a turn off. Despite that, I will go back to try other dishes, hopefully their mussels will be cleaned moving forward."

646,P-qjkvDDyQprOWj1yV8ZYA,1/7/2017,4 star rating,"A solid 4.5 star hotel in an excellent location!We enjoyed our four-night stay here for a long weekend birthday trip. Our first room on the 8th floor didn't have much of a view, and we were quickly moved to a higher floor by Nicholson, a very kind and attentive staff member. We headed out for the evening and upon entering our room we were greeted by a pleasant dessert surprise - it's little details like these that make for an enjoyable hotel stay. Our room was on the small side (not surprising for NYC standards), but very clean. The bathroom was generously sized with fresh flowers, large towels, and upscale toiletries. The hotel offers amazing food, but there are plenty of more reasonably priced options in close proximity to Sofitel - juice bars, coffee shops, diners, and more upscale dining. The little pizza place across the street was pretty good - truly authentic NY pizza. I would happily stay here again - and hope to in the near future!"
647,P-qjkvDDyQprOWj1yV8ZYA,3/10/2018,4 star rating,"The actual hotel was nice and located in a prime location (if you're looking to be near Times Square). I was not -- but I was working nearby so I didn't really have a choice. The whole vibe though, wasn't really my speed. If you're looking for young, hip, and cool -- this isn't it. The majority of the people who stay here are an older crowd and perhaps some families on holiday. It felt a bit stuffy. And also for the price of what you pay for the room, it's pretty basic. The bathroom is really nice though. The mirror has perfect built-lighting. And it's walking distance to Times Square if you want to catch a show or it's your first time in the city."
648,P-qjkvDDyQprOWj1yV8ZYA,12/21/2017,5 star rating,"We had a wonderful stay for 3 nights in an executive suite. I read alot of reviews beforehand and requested a fridge, coffee maker and that the minibar be locked - due to our 3.5 year old who liked to check everything out. We booked this suite as our child could go to bed earlier and we could close the doors to the bedroom and hang out.Top tips for booking is join the free Accor hotels loyalty program and you get a further 10% off the price offered by the hotel/various websites . We also ordered breakfast in advance which was free for children under 12 if the adults were ordering it. We had it in our room each morning which was a great treat and just paid the additional taxes and gratuity. It is much cheaper to preorder rather than itemize when you are there. Breakfast was very generous so we often put some leftovers in the fridge for later in the day.The staff were lovely, the room was very spacious for NYC. We were on the 21st floor with a great view of the Chrysler building.The only complaint was the Keurig coffee maker and sugar/milk was never replaced despite requests."
649,P-qjkvDDyQprOWj1yV8ZYA,5/23/2018,4 star rating,"I love this hotel for what it is....a boutique hotel that is as close to times square as you can get without being directly in it.But, it's quiet, secluded and literally a block or two away from EVERYTHING.Service was top notch but no pool and you literally are staring at a wall for a view. Also, room service is not 24/7 and ends at 11pm.Upside? The guests are all mature and the bar/restaurant was a nice alternative if you want to eat in."
650,P-qjkvDDyQprOWj1yV8ZYA,11/28/2015,4 star rating,"Trying to find a consistently good hotel in Manhattan that doesn't break the bank is hard.  What $250 a night buys you often disappoints and bargains in the $125-150 range are down right horrible so I splurged a lot and tried the $350 range for a night in mid-town Manhattan.  Sofitels are always top rate in terms of service, location, and rooms.  This one did not disappoint.  I was upgraded to a king from a queen which was great.  View was solid if a little dull.  Really quiet room, a killer bed that you nuzzle into and it just swallows you up.  Feather down duvet!  I was in heaven.  Great location blocks from Times Square and subway, bus, cabs galore.  Not on a super busy side street.  Definitely stay here again.  Great place.  Would give it 4.5 stars if it wasn't so darn expensive."

652,P-qjkvDDyQprOWj1yV8ZYA,8/31/2019,1 star rating,Had to change room 2x... first time the window was broken. Second time the bed sheets were wet in certain spots- gross. Stayed at other Sofitel's before and this one def doesn't come across as Sofitel worthy. Finally got a third working room but was smaller than the other two. Personnel did not seem surprised or apologetic...likely  not the first time it happened
653,P-qjkvDDyQprOWj1yV8ZYA,9/6/2017,4 star rating,"There is a lot to love about this hotel. The rooms are spacious, the hotel itself is beautiful, the location is superb. But we're trying The Knickerbocker on our next visit to NYC. Why? Hotel Sofitel is professionally run, but I would not say the staff is personable. Case in point: Anytime you approach the elevators, you walk by the front desk--which is about 15 feet off to your left. My daughter and I always looked over and smiled (usually giddy from being out and about in NYC) and not once did a staff member even look up, make eye contact or in any way acknowledge our presence. And we were there 5 days! That's a lot of trips back and forth to the elevator. Acknowledging every guest every time is certainly not doable, but a quick glance up, once in a blue moon, would help counter the general feeling of indifference.The concierge on the other hand was helpful and friendly. And room service staff were on time and lovely. (Coffee is great by the way.)Another thing. I am paranoid about bedbugs. Every hotel in NYC has experienced them, through no fault of their own, including Sofitel. Before our trip, I sent an email to the manager expressing my concern (paranoia) and asking for reassurance. Nada. No response whatsoever.The hotel just really doesn't go the extra mile in terms of attentiveness/friendliness to guests. I don't need staff fawning all over me, but a smile and a little more warmth might have encouraged us to rebook here. As it is, I am looking forward to seeing what else mid town has to offer in terms of hotels :)"
654,P-qjkvDDyQprOWj1yV8ZYA,7/10/2015,3 star rating,"Overall, my experience here was very positive. This is a fantastic hotel. The location can't be beat: it's in Midtown and is super close to everything, but it's on a relatively quiet street. Rooms are huge and super luxurious. The beds and pillows are ridiculously comfortable. The blackout curtains are freaking FANTASTIC. There's a shower and separate tub in the bathroom, and it's stocked with Lanvin toiletries, which is a nice touch. It's also very quiet. I was up on the 17th floor and didn't hear a peep for the first couple of nights. After that I could hear people in the neighboring rooms a bit, so the walls are thinner than I'd have liked, but it really wasn't bad overall. So why only three stars? I had two poor experiences with the housekeeping service. One evening I was in my room getting ready to go out, and a housekeeper opened the door, without even knocking. It alarmed me and also made me wonder what she was doing there, as my room had already been cleaned earlier in the day. Second, I left a bag of souvenirs in my room after I checked out. Admittedly, that was my own fault. But I called the hotel several times that same day and the housekeepers never turned the bag over to security, which is the hotel policy. So that was a major bummer. Not sure if I'd stay here again because of those two instances, which is a shame because otherwise, it was one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had."

We stayed on the 14 floor and we're pleased with the overall package. Our kids felt like they were at home, very comfortable and welcomed.We will definitely stay there again."

The empanadas was pretty good, the toast was okay not that much flavor. Also had the strawberry latte which was pretty sweet but still good. Loved that the servers were very friendly and nice!"
657,VLMxyAe_l9vvyFd5vEPZ4g,12/23/2022,2 star rating,"This review is based solely on their drinks (non-alcoholic). I live a short walk away and only ever have time to order from their coffee menu. I don't have a coffee machine in my house and I usually splurge on a coffee when I'm working in the office or out with friends. Since this cafe has opened I've been ordering different types of caffeinated drinks to try, but I'm never fully impressed. In the past year I've ordered: - small iced coffee (with simple syrup) twice- small iced cold brew (with simple syrup)- large iced matcha latte (as is) - small iced cappuccino (as is) - small passion fruit boba (as is) Simple syrup and milk (or alternative) are extra unless your order comes with these things already. In the times I've placed my order, I always ask for a small pump of simple syrup, and I'm always walking out the door with a cup of coffee with a thick visible layer of syrup at the bottom. Not everyone is a huge fan of sickly sweet coffee, but I've learned my lesson after three attempts at ordering coffee from here. I'll stick to adding sugar on my own. As an avid iced coffee drinker, I've ordered many cups of iced coffee and have never been given so much simple syrup as I have from this cafe. I think if you prefer simple syrup in your iced drinks, keep this in mind. Matcha latte was not worth the price I paid for it (can't remember the exact amount, but it was over $6). From experience, many cafes stick to using lower end matcha but you can sometimes still taste the flavor. My drink tasted mostly of milk. The green color is the only thing which indicated that it's matcha flavored. Iced cappuccino was fine. If anything, just order a shot of expresso and go home and add your own milk/ice. By this point I knew not to ask for a pump of simple syrup, knowing I'd be walking out with an overly sweet drink. Boba drink was also overly sweet, and the tapioca was hard. Would not recommend these types of drinks from here after reading other reviews about the same issue. If you're not fussy with your coffee, I don't think it's worth ordering anything other than a regular coffee. For me, this cafe is walking distance from my house and it's convenient."

We ordered the burrata toast, and after we were served, a lady came out to ask us if we wanted to warm the dish up since sitting outside makes it cold fast. We told her it was okay, but I much appreciated the gesture. We also had the chicken panini...So GOOD."
659,VLMxyAe_l9vvyFd5vEPZ4g,3/7/2022,5 star rating,"Came here over the weekend for a morning hangout and was very impressed with this coffee shop. When we got to the shop, we noticed it was right next to a laundromat and thought- wow everyone who needs a quick bite or a cup of coffee can easily get something from the cafe next door! To our surprise, I think both coffee shop and laundromats are operated by the same owner- there is a ""door"" between the two inside so you can walk between the cafe and laundromat. Anywho, just thought this was a smart idea! In front of the cafe is a outdoor seating that is self seating as long as you made a purchase or a customer of the laundromat. Very cute decor, comfy looking seating and very spacious! We went to sit at the back in the beer garden that had heated lamps (even though it was really nice out!) and again, another VERY cute outdoor-ish seating that is super spacious for hangouts! I think I saw some games as well- either way, the space is very nice. They offer food options, your regular coffee and tea options. I got a croissant and hot chocolate. Croissant was warmed which was a nice touch and hot chocolate was just a tad sweet but overall, ambiance, food AND the service was spot on. The lady who greeted us was very nice, smiley and very welcoming. I am not in the neighborhood often, but would be back if I am!"

Very serene, green everywhere you just feel that fresh vibe when you enter this cafe. Their out door is one of the best I have seen. They have one outdoor in the front and another one at the back which you will have to go through. They also have fine wine and beer. I have tried coffee, love their coffee. Shirley(I hope the spelling is correct lol) makes great coffee and she is always welcoming.

Dining in is always a really nice experience, the atmosphere is really calming and the staff are so pleasant and want to make your experience great. I highly recommend their vegetable samosas, naan and poori bread, and lamb or chicken curry meals. Leaving four stars because my most recent take-out chicken curry meal was really oily/greasy. After having eaten here countless times over the years, this has been the only time I've ever been slightly dissatisfied with the food. This place will continue to be my go-to for Indian food. :)"

672,T1CRoZ-f-hwrjdkBvt7_kg,1/22/2018,5 star rating,"A gem of the UWS, and one of my favorite Indian restaurants in the entire city. The storefront doesn't stand out at all, and the inside of the restaurant is small and rather quaint. There are no fancy decors, and everything is just incredibly simple, including the food. However, the taste of the food just speaks for itself.I've been here about a dozen times, and more than half the time I order the shrimp vindaloo (including this time), and it has never disappointed. This is the only place where I can order vindaloo, don't specify spiciness level, and it comes out perfect (and spicier than most places when I order extra spicy). They insist on using baby shrimp, which might be disappointing to some, but it keeps prices low (especially for this part of town), and really it tastes amazing. I might even argue that it tastes better than larger shrimps since it mixes much more easily with rice.For those of you getting takeout: please give dining in a shot. The staff is truly exceptional and really do their best to make your experience pleasant, in a casual and home-like atmosphere.Love this place, and I'll be a regular for as long as I am in the city."

The wait times are also super long regardless of the time you go, or what you order.

Beyond the myriad of problems this overpriced and under-attended ""restaurant"" poses by its mere existence, is the fact that its food is really, really bad.When this place opened there was a line around the block for the grand opening, but since that one fateful day I've seen maybe a total of 15 people EVER grace this horrible spot with their presence. It's the foodie version of the concession stand at a middle school marching band competition.  Recently, I found out just why this was the case.Upon entering the staff didn't seem to care much or notice that anyone was even there trying to order food, much less provide any service. The two employees couldn't have been more apathetic or rude and clearly couldn't wait to get out of there themselves.I ordered a cup of chili and a bacon wrapped hot dog (both hilariously pictured here). My girlfriend ordered a single burger and cheese fries (both, also hilariously pictured here). The staff proceeded to loudly scrape what was clearly burnt cheese scraps off the sides of the heated cheese container and slop the gelatinous mess into a tiny cup.....and then let it sit out on the counter for 10 minutes to get cold - after which he did the exact same thing to my chili. BAD.The bacon wrapped hot dog was over-salted, overcooked, and overpriced dog food. The chili was basically inedible. The hamburger was simply raw....not medium, not rare, but RAW and completely uncooked on the inside. The fries were deftly overcooked. Lastly, the cheese. The burned gelatinous mess was also absolutely inedible.Don't go to this fake mom and pop disaster - there's got to be a different concession stand in the neighborhood worth giving your money to."

I called tonight to figure out what that was all about and was told to call after 7pm, ""when the boss gets in"". I called a handful of times thinking there was something wrong with the line because, get this, I guess the owner must have gotten in and literally just started hanging up the phone like an 11 year old.

Our waiter never asked if we were satisfied with our dishes nor did he our empty glasses of water from our large bottle of water.. Though we are quite capable of pouring out own glass of water we expect to served and waited on. That's is the true fine dining experience."

For that, I would have walked to the deli myself!The food arrived cold (my plantains, eggs AND fried cheese were all solid hard)I asked for extra onions and got NO onions.They forgot my longaniza and refused to bring it to me (tried to remedy by giving me a $1 credit towards next order.) yea right, as if I would ever order from this place again!DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!I would give them negative 5 stars if i could"

Not to mention they forgot my water. All I had was a glass of ice. They also forgot my spoon. My knife and fork had stains on it as well.. I ordered white rice and beans and chicken. I barely got beans. Mostly bean juice. The chicken was cold and pink. And when I first walked in it smelled like something died. I'm so upset and do not want to pay for this. PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY. I usually love el Valle restaurants but this is beyond the worst place I've been to.

The store was empty so it wasn't store traffic or understaffing I also noticed that the utensils I was given were still dirty, as if barely washed. I left my plate full and I refuse to come back. I'm asking for my money back. Also, as we first walked in we were overwhelmed by the smell of dead mice. My partner and I were too cold to leave immediately but never again will we eat here."

They recommended a high chair except we got it there was food in the high chair seat and the whole thing was sticky.   Menus were sticky. Plates and silverware weren't that clean.  Had residue on them.  After we ordered food 4 peoples came out within 2 minutes. The other 3 took 20 minutes.  Best thing I had there was a coors light.  The food was not great but very expensive.  I was looking forward to another coors but the waiter never asked if I wanted another. Bad food.  Bad service. Bad hygiene.  Had to take two showers and order food when I got home.

Jasmine rice to make sushi? Little to no vinegar? To make things worse, the seaweed was extremely chewy. I had to really grind at it to break it apart. Conclusion: rice is wrong. seaweed is wrong. fish tasted normalThe sushi gets one star (I'm being extremely dangerous here already). The cleanliness of the restaurant gets another star."

The food is overpriced, and either bland, sickly sweet, or waaay too salty. No quality control in the kitchen, that's for sure. There is no pride or care in the food prep. The dishes taste inconsistent from one order to the next.  It is so disrespectful to charge so much and serve people food that is at best, subpar.

The food came about 30 seconds after we ordered it indicated it was obviously not made fresh. My chicken was raw and my husbands duck was completely dry. I asked to change my food and while I waited I saw a huge cockroach running on the floor. When I told the waiter he started running around chasing it, the entire scene ended with a cracking sound as the waiter squashed the roach under his shoe. U can't make this stuff up! 2 meals with a groupon still was over 50$ we didn't eat our meals and just paid because we felt bad and vowed never to go there again."

They have a number of many nerdy themed shots, so when you order them, the bartender puts on a little show an, badabing, you got yourself a drink! And it won't break your piggy bank either, which was especially nice after you've been drinking for hours at a rooftop (whoooops).The bartenders are a blast, lots of energy despite having to put on the little. I can't remember what our first shot was, I want to say the Winter is Coming, But whatever it was, it was delicious. I definitely remember the second shot being the Harry Potter shot, which was very good. I highly recommend that. You get to wear a​ scarf too. The bartender first game me a Gryffindor and I was like, aw shucks, I'm Slytherin, and he was all, I got you. And he did. This happy Slytherin felt recognized. Thanks, dude.While this is a pretty small establishment, it's pretty good to bring a group of friends because​ they do have minimum shot orders (especially for the LoTR shots and such). So maybe I'll be celebrating an event there in the near future."

They also have musical and prop shots for $8 which require a 2 shot minimum because it involves a whole performance with props and music. There's a musical shot for everything! I wanted to see the performances so I ordered the Winter is Coming and Harry Potter shots. The Winter is Coming shots had fireball and the Harry Potter shots tasted like butter beer and were sweet. They were both really easy shots but the best part was the performances. Big shoutout to the bartender Jason who performed both of them which involved a crown, a sword, a wand, a sorting hand, and a slytherin scarf. I took a video of the bartender Jason performing the Harry Potter shots and he just went for it.If you drink 100 shots in a year you get to create your own shot and name it and they sell it which is so cool!

But, it was a great test of their service. Can't say enough good things about them. You can order through GrubHub too but the order minimum is higher. They will deliver for $10.

It's pretty good and decent I'm not gonna lie the hash brown could use a little more flavor. I ordered myself the chocolate chip pancake lumberjack deal and it was really good. It tasted amazing especially the pancake stay nice and soft and fluffy.I have yet to try their lunch but so far their breakfast actually taste really good my boyfriend got an omelette the two times we got we went he actually got them at different ones to try it out they're pretty good and they are a lot bigger than we was expecting I actually ended up ordering out since I was too lazy to cook and I haven't had any bad experience with them. The staff and the waiters are very helpful and very polite. They do an amazing job and even if they're busy the try to keep the customers happy especially rush-hour in the morning.

I've had a bowl of pho with brisket and also the pork banh mi. I preferred the banh mi - although pricy at ~12+ ($14 including tip) they give you a lot of meat and it'll fill you up! Note that there is no restroom for use.
730,1Z030QuMVjMvs2SWZ1zYTQ,5/5/2022,5 star rating,"As a self professed pho connoisseur, I've been meaning to try this place. Been to most of the Vietnamese restaurants in the UES (from Pho Shop to Vietnaam and everywhere in between).  Took the family here on a Sunday afternoon. Small shop. Limited fast food style seating (ie sit wherever you want). Fast food style ordering but food is brought to your table.  Nice and clean decor. Owner is young, friendly and passionate about delivering a great experience. This is the 2nd shop with the 1st in the UWS.  We tried the Pho Dac Biet (with all meats), vermicelli with grilled pork, Chicken wings and summer roll. The owner was kind enough to give my kids a small serving of the fruit smoothie (always smart business to make the kids happy at immaterial incremental cost). Most important part of Pho is the broth and is very good here. Rich and flavorful. Bowl size is a little smaller than other areas in the UES and certainly much smaller than those in Chinatown.  Standard ingredients and sauces but noticeably fresher than other spots. The beef and meatballs (small, cute but flavorful) were good. The brisket is torn into strips which is atypical for Pho. Overall B on Pho. Kids graded it an A (have a suspicion the brilliant fruit smoothie had an influence in their grading). Chicken wings were an A. Definitely highlighted the visit. Not a traditional Vietnamese dish at all places but was very well fried and seasoned here. Summer rolls were B+. Very fresh and delicious but not tightly wrapped as you would normally expect so it falls after a bite hence a little messy. Vermicelli was delicious as well. A. Overall, fast, friendly, casual spot for good food. Will definitely visit again (kids have asked for it again )"

I love viet food, and I'm always looking for the next viet spot especially for the pho and banh mi. I ordered the spring rolls and the classic banh and man was that a huge sandwich! I literally ate a whole baguette and it was just the right amount of food too. The meat was juicy and tender and the sandwich wasn't overloaded with a lot of veggies. With every bite, it was a perfect balance of meat and veggies and a nice crunch with the bread. The spring rolls were pretty good too, but there wasn't anything special to them and I wish I got more of them in one box.The aesthetic of the place is amazing. There are huge plants in between seats so you can't really see the people around you and the wooden stools and tables gives a pretty cozy vibe. Overall, if you're in the area and are craving Viet food, I would check this place out and order the classic and definitely dine in."

738,1Z030QuMVjMvs2SWZ1zYTQ,9/10/2021,4 star rating,"So glad there is a new(-ish) Vietnamese restaurant near where I work on the Upper East Side and that they have a couple things that are vegan-friendly.I'm a big fan of vermicelli noodle bowls and they have a vegan tofu option, and instead of the Nước Mắm vinaigrette, there is the option of choosing the peanut (and almond?) hoisin sauce that is vegan (according to the staff).I love that they give a nice portion of tofu (a lot of places don't give you much), and the tofu is lightly battered and fried, making the outside lightly crispy.The only minor issue for which I would take half a star away from my review is that the second time I came to get a vermicelli noodle bowl for take-out, they must have been using an overly ripe cucumber because the skin was extremely tough and could not enjoyably be eaten. Normally I love cucumber with the skin, but this cucumber wasn't good eats.Also, the peanut (and almond) sauce seems to be mostly hoisin sauce with just a little bit of ground peanut and possibly almond on top? Or maybe there's a tiny bit of peanut butter in it?One of these days, I want to try the parmesan truffle fries (with vegan parmesan!) and the Vietnamese crepe that looks like it could be vegan with the tofu."

However I think these may be the only redeeming qualities of this place. The food is very average, and especially for the price, I was expecting it to be better. Can definitely find a better brunch spot - don't let the number of reviews fool you!"
746,JYNBy2r3LVhJbLHE1bASfg,10/27/2022,3 star rating,"Indoor and outdoor seating available. There is generous seating here, which can be good for large groups. However, it is quite loud. Service was ok, but the restaurant seemed really busy.The mac and cheese is $21, and can serve as a generous entree. However, there was not anything special about it except that it was served in a cast iron pan. The taste was good, but not something I would say is worth the price tag. The brussels sprouts had an interesting taste to it. It was oddly sour, so the flavor combination was a little off-putting. The sprouts themselves were well roasted though.Overall, this is a pretty average place with typical American fare with slightly higher prices than expected."
747,JYNBy2r3LVhJbLHE1bASfg,1/29/2023,4 star rating,"Definitely worth a visit. The food is fresh and creative. Our service was very good. People tend to linger here because the atmosphere is really lovely. So your wait at the door may be longer not because of the staff, but because people just love it here. We were slightly disappointed in the avocado toast order, which came with only one slice of toast.  And not a very big piece at that. So we asked for a second piece and they charged us three dollars which brought the total cost of an order of ""avocado toast"" to $25. That was a bit disappointing. There should be two slices of toast in this order."
748,JYNBy2r3LVhJbLHE1bASfg,1/22/2023,4 star rating,"This location is always busy because it's close to Central Park and Lincoln center and is popular for both locals and tourists.  The menu is expansive and should cater to everyone's palette.  I've been to the other locations as well and my go starter is the warm potato chips with blue cheese.  Simply amazing !  I decided to take the hostess recommendation and had the schnitzel (the vegetarian version ).  For someone who's a meat lover, I enjoyed the dish.  I would recommend the tartare served on top of crispy rice as well. Be Warned that this place is super busy and it feels more like a food hall ( like eataly meets a french bistro).  If you're looking for a quiet restaurant, this may not be it but if you're out with a group of Friends, this is the right place"

The pork belly bao is perfectly seasoned, tender, and juicy. The dim sums are super flavorful, fresh and juicy. Really! If you bite into one, it's an explosion of flavors. Try not to get juice everywhere else. Try not to eat it on the walk home from picking it up. Super stuff!"

I'm curious if they're BYOB because didn't see booze on the menu. The title ""Snack shop"" is fitting. It's Not 5 star vibe more casual lunch vibe but would 100% go back."

Thank goodness it lived up to the hype!Dry aged beef potstickers ($7) and the gwaco pork belly bun ($5) are a fab combo for a quick lunch. Not gonna lie my initial thought was $5 for one bun is pricey but honestly the pork belly was SO good. I'm scared to say perfect but I don't know if ever had one more perfect. :)Staff is fantastic, and space is clean although it can fit only about 15-20 people.I'm so happy I can just hop on the subway and make it here in a few stops!"
757,9FwX2ye1eCxnPVoQOHHr3g,2/2/2020,4 star rating,"The ""Shanghai belly"" noodles with melt-in-your-mouth pork belly, garlic, and ginger scallion sauce was my favorite. The sweet chili ribs were slightly crunchy and just the right amount of sweet. The vinegary pickled cucumbers on the side were a refreshing touch. The pan-fried pork dumplings were very juicy, but overall it was a tad salty (though I'm a bit sensitive to salt). But overall I enjoyed every bite and need to come back for more. The shop is inspired by old Chinatown teahouses and the walls are lined with Asian snacks like Yan Yan and Pocky. There are only a few tables at the Windsor Terrace location (the entire restaurant probably only seats 10 people max), but it's worth the trek out there. They serve everything from boba to Hong Kong hot cakes to pork belly bao, so there are plenty of things to try! Giving it four stars because the price point was less than ideal for a place touted as being ""cheap"" ($40 for the noodles, ribs, and dumplings) and because they may have oversold themselves as  ""best dumplings"" in NYC."
758,9FwX2ye1eCxnPVoQOHHr3g,12/4/2020,1 star rating,"Im not the type to leave food reviews no matter how much i dislike ones food. I would simply just not go back. But i felt the need for this one, grew up around sunset park foods there are great, not the best but for the price you can't expect 3 star Michelin. Came across this dumpling store while working around the area, Saw all the awards posted in front of the door stating how good the dumplings are. So i gave it a shot, knowing i could get 6 dumplings for $2.50 from a very notable restaurant, but that was a 25min drive and since i was working around the area I can't risk spending 30min looking for parking after. But if it tastes good, hey I wouldn't mind the price for good food. Upon receiving my order i felt robbed, and scammed. Had i know $7.50 would only get you FIVE bite size dumplings, i would have went across the street for a slice of pizza instead. I was pretty disappointed at the portion cause i know this isn't enough, and that i would still be hungry after. But I'm like good foods always comes in small portions, nothing to complain here right? WRONG!!!!!!!The amount of salt, and the after taste of the pork, you would need to drink a full bottle of water to even wash it out, i was stuffed alone from drinking the water. Like I said I usually don't complain, but if you're paying $1.50 per dumpling that leaves a very strong porky after taste, plus the salt. I don't know, maybe i got a bad batch, but i still would not be coming back, cause its not worth the price at all, $7.50 would have bought me around 20 dumplings."

I get it: this is an old standby and it is something of a pricey and discreet little red sauce haven. It has rules and time-tested ways. I respect that. That is what makes these classic New York institutions special. As a lifelong New Yorker, I personally appreciate that. But still. I had a full course meal and cocktails to the tune of a substantial bill. As I was leaving the bar, I snapped a quick picture of the place to keep a memory. To my surprise, I got a very stern and condescending finger wag declaring ""No"" from the host: Do not take that picture. Cmon man... A respectful and paying customer isn't allowed to snap a picture? This isn't the Pentagon."

They were supposedly ""quiet"" for a weekend night because it was during spring vacation and a lot of people were traveling, but it still felt full to us. The restaurant attracts an older crowd, and boy do they get rowdy! It is fascinating to watch people leave dinner, after one or two too many drinks. The food was very good, I got the spaghetti bolognese and my boyfriend got the veal parm.  We enjoyed every last bite, and we even got a side of string beans which were obviously lathered in butter and it was so yummy. The manager did stare at us quite a bit, probably because we were the youngest ones there (30). I was a bit uncomfortable but I am not holding it against them. My only complaint is the cost. It is VERY expensive. But they do pour a large wine glass!"

I took my mother out to dinner on a whim; I figured I was doing something nice by taking her out to an Italian restaurant.Well, let me tell you we had one of the worst experiences I could even imagine. First of all, we walked in wearing what you would consider your ""Sunday best,"" and the stares we got were innumerable. SORRY I DON'T WEAR MY PEARL NECKLACE EVERY WHERE I GO. As we were walking to our seat, the UES b*tches were staring at us and shaking their head. When we got to our seats, there was an older couple sitting across and facing us. Well, I must say, we were the talk of their dinner. That is SO not a community I would ever want to be around. While all of this is happening, the server didn't even recognize we were there until at least 10 minutes into us sitting, THEN we got our menus. My mother and I were starving, so we figured we would just stay and eat. They were snarky at the fact that I didn't order a glass of wine. So, just to tick everyone off even more, I ordered a cheap pasta, and my mother ordered the least- expensive chicken dish. After our food came out, our check was dropped before we finished eating. Ohhhhhhhhhh honey, don't worry, I wanted to get the hell out of there faster than you wanted me out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR TIME and GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

Now they are the most popular eatery in the food court (and the only edible food)  and that is to their detriment.The lines get long but go very fast and that's the problem. They take your order very quickly and don't even give you your utensils now. And the food is now produce en mass, reducing the quality of the preparation. They must put heroin in the teriaki sauce though, since I will swear on everything I love that it's the best I've ever had.I will keep on coming back as long as they keep up the good work.

Don't talk down like that to me. They did the same to the person in front of me as well. The girl complained that they gave way too little chicken and the cooks said ""you want more chicken, pay money"". This is why they work the jobs they work."

Came out on a platano which looked amazing. Tasted good. Calamari came out on the chilly side. Had to send it back. Smh. Not a good start Viva.They brought back another one quick and it was hotter. Obviously this is not made fresh. Probably some frozen calamari. However it tasted okay. Not bad. We ordered a pitcher of Margarita on the rocks. Just regular. Ughhhh just nasty! Hated it. Tasted like a headache waiting to happen!! No thank you. I let my friend have at it. Entrees: I ordered the chicken enchiladas. Which I have to say was delicious BUT it wasn't hot. More in the chill side and I didn't send it back because I was starving. So I sucked it up. My boyfriend hated his fries which I mean... come on... who messes up fries???

After departing from an appointment that was well received only to be mere feet of distance on Metropolitan Avenue to be electrocuted by eye witnessing electricity dangerously spewing from a live wire of a utility line, I quickly sought the nearest indoor shelter for substance. Disappointingly from memory Arby's had the most flavorable chicken cordon bleu sandwich, which has been discontinued. I do love their very mild spicy curly French Fries and their market fresh Turkey wrap. Service is efficient and attentive for clients to be reference by first name basis in a fast food restaurant is unknown for this Arby's #7737.  Facilities is full operational and clean with a airplane style lock ""vacant"" or ""occupied"" indicator on outside of door.  There is a Captain's Bell bell (originated by Long John's Silver who Arby's later copied in their franchise chain) to be rang upon exiting for clients to loudly voice their appreciation of a good experience, which is much better than standard written comment cards to be easily lost or never reaching its final destination to the corporate headquarters lair."

Drive through service is usually pretty quick and efficient. Food is prepared as you expect from an Arby's. One nice touch is they have a bunch of pictures of the old Restaurant it replaced, I guess as a concession to people in the neighborhood reminiscing about the past."

811,lnrlmxRwXwx5pru2iPKx1w,3/14/2021,5 star rating,"Came across this adorable coffee shop on Yelp. There were a couple of outdoor seating with heater lamps, and a slidable door for privacy. The cafe store itself was small yet cozy (with a lot of Nutella), and an extremely friendly owner explaining the desserts and bakeries they have and answering any questions I had. We ordered cappuccino, matcha latte, and zeppola. The owner elaborated that the zeppola is an authentic Italian dessert, made typically for Italian Father's Day and other occasions. The zepolla crust was crispy and had a texture similar to cream puffs. In between the crust, there were vanilla flavored creme with a hint of lemon flavor, balancing perfectly with crunchy yet not too sweet dessert. The cappuccino was fantastic. I could smell the strong coffee bean aroma once it was served to our table. The matcha latte (which I replaced with oat milk) had really good foam, but the matcha flavor was a little light. I provided feedback to the owner and he received it positively and we ended up having a fifteen minute conversation about the cafe. I would definitely come here again for the friendly owner, authentic Italian dessert and coffee."

The bakery opened in 2020 and one of the employees told me that they were still in the process of setting up all their marketing and social media outreach activities. At present, they only have an Instagram account.Ceresella is one of the better Italian bakeries in our area and appears to have a tradition in baking Italian pastries.Cerasella is a hole-in-the-wall bakery, perhaps one of the smallest bakehouses in size in LIC/Astoria? I ordered a chocolate Nutella cheesecake which came out of the display fresh and ready to eat. The cake was delicious.If you are looking for something authentic on a sunny day, they are a must."

We both had the Greek cake for dessert. Everything was delicious and filling. This location overlooks the Hudson, so you have a beautiful view. It is also in the same building as the Edge.

I came on a weekday lunch for a business lunch, and it seemed like the whole restaurant was in business casual attire as well. We went for the lunch set menu, which was just under $50 per person. For that you get one appetizer, one main, and one dessert. I got the calamari for appetizer. I thought this was great - they were light and crispy and paired well with the sauce. For the main course, I ordered the grilled fish of the day. This was tender and moist, and the charred skin was super flavourful. For dessert, I had a spiced cake. It was a bit on the sweet side for me personally, but the flavours were all great. Overall, I enjoyed this meal! Just be warned that service might be quite slow - we spent over 2h for our lunch here."

From walking into Hudson Yards, the decor was absolutely beautiful, and it was so festive for the holidays. It is an absolute must see even if you're not going to eat at Milo's. But Walking up to Milos, the entrance, there was a very modern white winding staircase, with great lighting to take pics on. And then upon arriving at the dining area, is an overview of the entire restaurant which is very pretty. I was there for dinner, but had show tickets, so we had to cut our dinner short and had to forgo the dessert, but our appetizer and main course did not disappoint! We started out with the fired eggplant and Zucchini with delicious Tzatziki sauce. Then we were undecided what to get for dinner, so our waiter suggested we pick out a fish and they would broil it for us! So that's exactly what we did. They brought us over to the fresh fish ice bar area, and we chose the most delicious white fish ever!We paired our meal with the fingerling potatoes as a side dish, but I have to say they were a bit tasteless. Next time I will definitely try the french fries instead. Again, since we were short on time and had to make it to a show, we did not get to have dessert. But I absolutely would have loved to try one of their desserts."
825,hU1ajPmHi-kU6iNbowoEZg,2/5/2022,2 star rating,"4.5 for the service, 1 for the food. I personally think this is a place that's selling more of its view (the vessel) than the actual food.  We came here for lunch on a Saturday. Didn't like the hostess's attitude downstairs. Once we got upstairs, we were welcomed warmly and were seated right away. Supposedly everything on the menu is family style and meant to share. We ordered octopus, Greek spread, and grilled whole fish of the day, plus spaghetti with butter sauce for the kids. First thing first, spaghetti was unbelievably bland, my kids usually eat restaurant pasta and they wouldn't take more than one bite. I tasted it and it's the worst kids pasta I've had anywhere in the city. Greek spread was okay - nothing amazing, in general lacking flavors. Octopus was very well cooked, came with hummus and onion, it was honestly the only good thing we had the whole lunch. Grilled whole fish was overcooked, period. Throughout lunch, service was very attentive and they kept on checking if we got everything we needed with kids. Overall, overpriced and very mediocre food (close to $200 including tip for above mentioned food). The opportunity cost is too high. We wouldn't come back here."

A very modern, clean, upscale vibe. Definitely very pricey and I'm not sure I'd go on my own (their online menu doesn't even have prices) but a good spot to go to when the company is paying. The fresh seafood selection is quite impressive and expertly/simply prepared as they let the quality of the fish speak for itself. The menu can be a bit overwhelming/confusing as there are so many options and many priced by the pound (and some must be shared) but I was happy to share the loup de mer with my colleague when that's what he wanted but they only had a fish for two. Sides need to be ordered individually (we had the broccoli and potoates) and while there is nothing special to the sides themselves, I find it necessary to have something on the side of a piece of fish. The Milos Special appetizer was impressive and tasty. A good spot to go to when you are looking to impress someone."

It was $39 for 3 courses - appetizer, entree and dessert.The view of this restaurant is amazing - overlooking Hudson yards on the 6th floor.For appetizer, got the oyster and mezze plate - oysters were quite good (especially the West Coast ones). The mezze plate had some pita but they gave us a whole basket of pita after they realized we had run out (so thoughtful)!The entree were a little underwhelming though. The fish I had was a little bit fishy and the meat felt a little brittle compared to other fish I have had before. The chicken was okay, the side of eggplants that came with the chicken was great.For dessert, I really liked the Greek yogurt - it was super rich and not super sweet, that was great!Overall, service was fantastic. Appetizers and desserts were good. Entree was just okay but for the price tag I definitely expected a higher taste score."

The place was decked out with Halloween decorations and had pretty good music playing without having it on blast. This is the ultimate spot for comfort food, especially on a dreary day. I shared the Mini Shepherd's Pie with my coworkers and we all thought it was really good. The mashed potato topping really hit the spot. Their Grilled Salmon was also very nicely done. They put it on top of spinach, which ended up being a bit sautéed from the oil. The onions also gave it a nice crunch as well!"

My girlfriends and I decided to start our Saturday off with bottomless brunch, and had read online that their bottomless cocktails are only $15 to add to your meal. For New York City we were shocked and thought we'd check it out since it was just around the corner from where we were staying. Boy am I glad we braved the cold and came!To start off, the staff is super friendly and attentive. As soon as your glass started emptying it was full before you even noticed as they had filled the pitchers quickly for mimosas and bellinis. I even had a Bloody Mary to start and a beermosa. We definitely got our money's worth in drinks. They kept checking in on us and were quick with everything. The brunch menu also had a good selection and I have to say our food was delicious for breakfast type food. There wasn't a bite of food left on anyone's plate. I had the salmon scramble and it was full of flavors. The salad was simple with arugula and a light dressing, but it worked very well. The toast helped make the meal feel full. The portions are great for the price. Our food also came out quickly, which is good since we had a few drinks already :)I'm surprised to see this place isn't packed more on the weekends. It's a shame, but maybe my view isn't as accurate since it was the coldest weekend in NY. This would be a great place for happy hour and their bar spans 3 walls full of alcohol! The entire space is huge and I would love to rent this out for social gatherings. It is also very cozy inside with the decor and furniture. This is on my list of places to come back to when I'm in NYC again. There's no better way to start a boozy Saturday with friends!"

I'm not sure if the cabins are just for the wintertime or year round but nonetheless they are a nice addition any time. Just a note, you reserve the cabins for a set timeframe so keep that in mind because if it's busy you won't be able to extend your time. They have a nice variety of dishes from traditional American fare to bao buns. I ordered the steamed mussels, which were lacking flavor. They would have been tastier if the bowl wasn't fulled to the point where you can't access the liquid/ sauce at the bottom. The mussels tasted great with the sauce, but you can't access it until you get halfway to the bottom. The truffle potato curls were tasty, but you can't go wrong with truffles on anything.

We were here for a birthday dinner and someone came and took photos of the group which was awesome! It was a chilly night and it seemed like our waiter was not mindful of that and kept opening the door to our glass house letting a lot of cold air in. Nonetheless, we made the best of it. I really enjoyed the Serendipity. Pretty drink, not too sweet, and great to sip on with dinner. The Spanish Octopus was disappointing; I'd skip it. The Steamed Mussels were actually delicious but I felt that it being served with a bread basket was unusual rather than fries which either seems like an oversight on their end or a way to save money.

For a party of 6, they seated us immediately and it was on a gorgeous front by the water. A perfect warm Autumn day with a slight breeze. Our waiter was very courteous and took our drink orders and food choices quickly. This place so far was a win. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Nachos because I wasn't too hungry and just needed something with flavors to snack on. This dish surprised in so many good ways. Points go to the creativity of this dish where instead of nacho chips and cheese overflow. Instead it goes to using Asian ingredients such as the wonton crisps as chips, wasabi and avocado spread, some Napa cabbage for the green salads, sesame oil and the ahi tuna as the protein. I enjoyed this dish so much that it was all me who munched on it. Also ordered the blueberry frosé but was not a fan of it, just stick to the strawberry flavor. The blueberry one had a tint of bitterness more than I'd like in my alcoholic beverage. Very pricy place with a good view, as expected of a restaurant on South Street Seaport. But my reason for deducting a star is because of the weird bathroom structure. There were two doors but both doors led to the same room. It was a hollowed out bathroom with lots of confusion and how to form a line when waiting for the stalls. Granted I've been hit by the doors (plural) a few times just waiting for a free stall. This was an interesting experience and I understand the need for open space but it was quite weird.  Aside from the bathroom, everything itself was nicely done. I will try dining indoors to experience the cozy comforts next time."

We also started with the ahi nachos which the guac and fish were perfectly fresh!   Service wasn't too bad for a weekday lunch time, and I loved the atmosphere. They even have these mini igloos outside which would've been nice to enjoy if it wasn't cold and rainy that day but definitely good to know for the future."

The delivery was always a challenge to due to the location of my home.  I ordered the soft garlic butter shrimp tacos with the following toppings: Guacamole, Verde Salsa, Roasted Corn Salsa, Shredded Cheese, Shredded Romaine, Lime Wedge, and cilantro.  I also ordered the mango verde sauce and lemon herb sauce on the side.  There was no additional cost for the toppings and two sauces on the side.  When I opened the package, the portion size was generous and very filling definitely worth the $12.95. It's also better to order or dine in directly to avoid the service fee from Uber Eats. I have definitely returned to this spot for a Yelp Elite Event earlier this month, the link to the review is below:yelp.com/biz/elite-week-…."

I ordered a Nachos & got delivered - No quacamole, smallest amount of corn and salsa I have ever seen in a nacho and NOOO nacho chips. I got double portion of black beans and here I am eating my Nacho that I paid $12 for with Ritz crackers for the crunch. Im going to say that what i got was flavorful but I will probably not do uber eats from here anymore. Maybe i'll try walk in and see what the experience is.

Had to beg him to play something crappy so I could take a break from dancing. I danced so much that my body ached the next day. Will definitely visit this spot again.
901,tb4jjBjjyVmoaVvdcj2HEA,2/13/2016,1 star rating,"Smelly, dirty, verbally abuse bouncers. Generally not a good time...  I was there with a group for my friend's birthday.  One of the bouncers Mike miraz?, apparently a manager, kicked me out of the bar because I politely asked him to not call me ""sweetie"".  I think my exact words were ""sir, I would prefer it if you didn't call me that because it's a bit condescending"". Not only did he not apologize to acknowledge my statement, he repeatedly called me sweetie on purpose several more times after that just to instigate the situation, then finally, as I was walking away, he was obviously not done with the conversation so he pulled me back by my jacket hood, which choked me bc it was zipped up tight.  He also did it so hard that now a chunk of fur on the collar is missing.  Although this type of demeaning behavior may be typical of bouncers, especially at dodgy places, it is hardly acceptable... I probably would have brushed off his rude comments in my college days but now I'm older(over 30) and a bit more accomplished.  I think perhaps I just have a lower tolerance for this type of behavior.  I have the good fortune of being treated like a professional at work and respected equal in my personal life so I'm just not accustom to harassment like this.  Hopefully others have a better experience when they go."

Cocktails are not horribly priced ($13 each) and they also serve beer and wine. Bouncer and bartenders are friendly.

The dance floor was very crowded and some nudging is expected, but not this kind of violent behavior. He has been celebrating his birthday there for 3 consecutive years, and always has 30+ people.

Wait, I retract that statement. I do like dancing until the sun comes up, but not in this kind of setting. The place does have an interesting layout, that I can say honestly. There is a downstairs area which is cozy and snug, but just way too many people on a Friday night. When you start seeing bottles of champagne, you know someone is having a party and their whole posse is in tow. Oh man, be prepared for an evening of expensive drinks, top 40s jams, and shouting. I am sure this place would be OK on a weeknight, so I am wiling to come back and give it another try. But for now, definitely not coming back on a weekend."

I do not recall what the crowd was like upstairs but downstairs was mostly people in their 20s. The space is really small and it gets really packed.Music: Mostly hip hop (old and new school) but they throw a some reggae here and there. They even played one salsa, and yes, you know I was on the dance floor for sure! Service and price: No cover; The bouncers were ok. Drinks are expensive $13 a popThis place is chill but I would rather go to bOb because the music is better and the crowd is more diverse."

Since no utensils given, one of our companions stirred her coffee with a straw which melted. That was the straw that broke the camels back, no pun intended.

My first thought was I really like the cool concept of the outside needs some work but really love the diner feel. Once you walk inside the doors barely close all the way, and right away you can tell this location needs a lot of renovations!! The mirrors are cracked and dirty, the booths needs some updating as well as this place on general needs a new fresh paint job. It's also a very small location so just the wait time is many times between 15-20 minutes on a weekend around 11am. Me still looking pass the looks of the place, we still sat down and ate. Our waiter Chris was very friendly however was a bit shaken with the hands dropping the creamer. As always I ordered my infamous double berry banana pancakes, that comes with hash browns, eggs, and bacon. I also ordered a coffee. And if you know me you know I LOVE COFFEE!! The coffee they made was burnt! I tried to drink through one and had asked for another one, and even the second cup was burnt as well. Which was super sad for a coffee lover like me.The hash browns, eggs and bacon came out first while the pancakes came out five minutes later. The chef with my breakfast was not the best of Denny's.  The pancakes instead of being super fluffy it actually had CRUNCHY edges. when my foodie partner told me to try his hash browns his was super oily and gross! I honestly was very disappointed with my breakfast. I even told my foodie partner in crime I would of rathered traveled the extra 6 miles to the one in Long Island. I hope the owner as well as the business shapes there business around for the best, because this is a fabulous locations to have an amazing establishment."

They nicely introduced me the menu and made some good recommendations. We tried naju gomtang and suyuk. Tasted pretty authentic. I liked how suyuk was on a portable heating device so it stays warm. It was served with kimchi, white rice, raddish kimchi. The only part that I didn't like was raddish kimchi. I don't think they go well with rest of the food but everything else was great! Recommend to visit"

Some people might not like that, but I loved it. It is super crunchy and not that oily. The soup with rice was okay. I personally didnt really like the rice just dumped into the soup like that. But the flavor of the soup is on point. The meat was tender. The staff are really nice, filling my side dishes when I didnt even ask for refills."

I went around 6pm on a Thursday and they were quite full. Service is super fast, they seated us immediately. There is a side drawer where you help yourself to extra utensils and napkins. For the banchan side dishes, they keep it simple with kimchi and radish kimchi. We ordered the special gomtang, haemul pajeon, suyuk, and jjajangmyun for a group of 3. They give a good amount of seafood in the pancake. My mom was impressed by the color of the gomtang broth and said it tasted really clean. The jjajangmyun was a bit salty for our liking. The cartilage pieces from the suyuk order was bomb with the sauce. We left super full. I wouldn't go out of my to come with friends but I would come back if I were eating with my parents again."

Good music playing but not enough room to dance downstairs we ended up making our way upstairs since it was easier to dance here.Plenty of space to sit below more for lounging than dancing upstairs u have another bar some seating & a little more open space to dance.

Shout out to DJ Lloyd because the music was fireeeee all night. On the day of the party, Alex was our bartender (another incredible guy, who also DJs! If you come on a Friday, you can listen to his tunes!!) and Karen, the bar manager was helping to manage everything. This is an all star team folks. They knew exactly what I wanted and helped me make it my dream bday celebration. The party was EVERYTHING I wanted and I couldn't be happier. Everyone in my crew was asking how I found this gorgeous venue with incredible staff and I feel incredibly lucky that I did!!If you're looking to grab a few drinks at any time, Madame X is a must visit and if you're planning a birthday and want a private space, it's even more of a must visit!Attaching some photos of the incredible space.

Though they have excellent chicken salad & often (but not always) their bagels are great, I find that more often than not, I'm disappointed. At best, I leave happy 50% of the time. Today, my bagel is over-cooked and not soft at all. This happens frequently when I skip the morning rush and get an  afternoon bagel. Last time I was there, my $9 (plus tip) order was wrong. I got home to see that my chicken salad bagel was actually tuna. So disappointing! And like other reviewers mentioned, I too find that they play around with the prices. Not cool.

An UMAMITACULAR experience. You also get 2 sides so naturally I opted for the usual low simple starch veggies, baked mushrooms and carrots. 4yrs ago, prices used to be $6.50 + tax w/ a free soda & soup. Prices are now $7.95 + tax, nothing included but half a kaiser roll. Portion sizes are still enough to get you full.

She claimed I only gave her $13 to which I replied, ""no, I gave you $14.

This place is a little hard to spot if you aren't looking for it, but I am so glad I stumbled in here. The service was extremely fast, I was out in five minutes. The burger was phenomenal, meat was juicy, the veggies and the bun were fresh. The price was a deal for the area as well: $6.95 for a burger with fries and a can of Coke. The only misgiving I had was that they didn't make the fries as I ordered them, they just grabbed some that were already made. I guess they do that when its busy, since there was nothing wrong with them. I settled on 4 stars since I haven't tried anything else, but I will definitely go back."

You get a sandwich/burger/gyro/wrap whichever you decide and it comes with fries and a cup of soup! Super affordable and guarantee you probably won't be able to finish it all. It is your best bet for good food at a great price. I usually end up spending around $6 - $8 there. There are cheaper options but I think you get a lot of bang for your buck. I haven't tried their other hot foods yet but I will let you know what I think when I do. The ladies at the cashier are super friendly. My first time there the guy didn't remember my fries and the lady asked if I had wanted them. Even when I went vegetarian she asked if I wanted a salad instead. Great Service. I usually take out and I never had delivery but I have read other reviews that delivery time can take a while. Nevertheless Traders Express has become my go to lunch place!

Desserts are priced between $3-11, which is reasonable in comparison to other shops in the area. Their variety ensures that there's something new to try every time you come here.It's a small shop that seats about 11 people in a mix of bar and desk seating. Decor is school-inspired with six elementary classroom desks and there are coloring pages and crayons for guests to use. I would avoid coming here with more than 2-3 people during peak hours if you want to sit and chat. All in all, a cute shop serving good desserts. Not my favorite but a welcome addition to 86th Street nonetheless."

Inside those desks you can find paper and crayons to color with, as well as a small set of Connect Four to play with your friends. The staff was nice and went out of their way to move stuff toget an extra seat for us to accommodate an extra person at our table. I got the mango pomelo with taro balls. It was delicious! The mango was fresh and the taro balls had a great chew to it. It was a refreshing meal with the cool mango pomelo. I would get this again. Minimum $15 for credit card.

The classroom aesthetic is super cute and complete with school desks with coloring sheets inside for something to do while you wait for your food. Another great point is that the combos are highly affordable to sample a few items while still being much cheaper than the nearby Mango Mango and Prince Tea House. I ordered Combo C which comes with your choice of crepe cake, a drink and mango milk noodles. The crepe cakes are on the smaller side but the passion fruit cake I ordered delicious. The tartness of the passion fruit was perfectly offset by the sweet cream. I also ordered the honeydew bubble tea which was pretty standard but the bubbles were delightfully chewy without being soggy. Finally, the milk noodles were the most interesting dish. The mango juice was refreshing and the milk noodles don't have much flavor but they're very refreshing. It's topped off with fresh mango chunks that finish it off perfectly."

We ordered the ube crepe cake, milk pudding, rose bubble milk tea, durian pancake, and mango pomelo. After we ordered, the worker told us the ube crepe cake was frozen, and asked if we wanted another flavor instead. We chose earl grey, but this also told us their crepe cakes are not made in store and are probable pre-bought ): The earl grey crepe cake was okay, the crepe tasted more like an egg waffle than a crepe. The cream itself had very little flavor of earl grey. The rose bubble tea was very very sweet, and had a very strong rose flavor, but not overbearing where it tasted like perfume. If it was a little less sweet it would have been perfect! The durian pancake was very good, the durian was pretty fresh as compared to other places that serve this. However, there was a lot of pancake and not a lot of cream and durian. I removed the excess pancake, and it resulted in about half of it gone. The mango delight was alright, the mangoes were fresh but that's about it. The milk pudding, although definitely store bought, was the best thing we got. It was super light and fresh, and definitely worth the money.Overall, this place was okay. We could have gotten the wrong things, but probably would not come back."

The school desks transported me back to simpler, carefree days, they provide ""busy work - of coloring sheets and crayons - in the desks to occupy your time while you wait for your sweets, and I wish I could keep their spoons because of how cute they are.Getting to the desserts, I got a slice of Earl Grey crepe cake, a mango coconut aloe drink, and mango milk noodle, which was new to me.The mango milk noodle does not contain actual noodles but what feels like strands of tasteless white jelly. They provide good texture in the bowl of mango chunks and puree, but that's about it for its purpose. I wasn't too thrilled with it and would not order it again. But I should add that, even though it's not mango season right now, the mango's ripe, sweet, and doesn't feel like there's added sugar. The same goes for the mango in our drink. I got chunks of aloe as I drank it, but I totally forgot about the coconut component because I just didn't taste it. I thought the dollop of white cream in the drink was snow white instead. Overall, still a refreshing drink for summertime. And finally the dessert I was looking forward to the most as an Earl Grey fan: its crepe cake version. What a big load of disappointment! It's probably a bad batch because other reviewers said only good things. I expected light and airy cream between the layers but had what I would describe as thick gunk; I felt like I ate some opened box of store-bought cake that has been on the shelf wayyy past the date. The layers easily separated as I cut into it with the spoon. It was difficult to finish, and the server didn't even question why half of the cake was left unfinished as she cleared the table.Would I go back again? Maybe for a drink. I really wanted to like this place, but the items I tried today are making me hesitant :("

I enjoyed the mango juice part and the noodles was something different that I was excited to try. I was not disappointed.My boyfriend had the passionfruit mille crepe and he couldn't stop eating it (that means he enjoyed it ). They gave us two of these floral spoons which is SUPER cute and I think it made the cut of the crepe easier to eat than with a fork. (or maybe i'm just overthinking it)For the mango juice with aloe, they put it in a to go HOT cup with this cute heart accessory (it stops the drink from spilling through the mouth hole).I really enjoyed my dishes.

The pros: Nice brick interior with awesome photographs and artwork.The cons: Onto the less positive things...The omelet and egg scrambled were bland and didn't ""wow"" us.  We were hoping to have received a crisp mixed green salad, instead, it was wilted.  Asked for hot sauce, but it tasted like Buffalo wing sauce. Not enough of a selection on sliced bread (they only serve white.) Took a while to get a cup of coffee.  I found it odd that it was brunch and was told that coffee needed to be brewed.  Additionally, service could improve as well. Needless to say, we left feeling underwhelmed and would not return."

Even tho Google said they were closed on Saturday at 1pm, Daniel said it's because they just started doing brunch on Saturdays.I have told all my friends about this place.. I will definitely be returning, I must experience the live jazz on Sundays. My only complaint was the chairs were kinda restricted.. yes they do have booth/ bench like seating but the regular restaurant chairs are for ""narrow hip"" ppl .. lol. I am curvy and voluptuous so my hips was a bit tight in the chairs but other than that NO COMPLAINTS. I'll definitely be returning!!!!"

The restaurant layout is cluttered very minimal space in between seats and tables. I understand you would want to have more tables to serve more customers but there should be an decent spacing between the next. By cramped I couldn't even lift my elbows without invading the person next to me space. Food wise it was bland. No seasoning what so ever. I got the biscuits and gravy and the only thing that had flavor was the bacon. There was suppose to be pork sausage in my gravy and as you can see there was barely specs of ""sausage"". The amount of biscuits is way too much for the little amount of sauce they serve. I didn't even eat the biscuit on the left. There wasn't even salt or pepper on the table for me to give this meal some flavor. For the price they charge their meals in this place is ridiculous for tasteless food. My friends meals were also bland. Would not recommend or come back to this establishment."

This review is slightly overdue but, two friends and I visited for a much-needed little ladies night outing (in the midst of the pandemic) in October 2020.We were temperature checked, seated in a distanced manner, and served by a waiter wearing a face mask. It is comforting to local spots enforcing regulations while maintaining quality in the standard of service food and drinks.The portion sizes are pretty massive - and definitely can be shared and I had two Henny from the Blocks that hit the spot. My girls were also pleased with their libations.Thank you for always providing a perfect backdrop and wonderful time, Charlie's!"

We arrived at around 1:45 on a Friday afternoon. Only 3 tables besides our party of 4. 1 hostess/waitress and 1 cook/chef.  After 20min+ and no one taking our order we inquired.  The overwhelmed waitress said she had 6 drinks to make and would get to us soon.  (Wondering why the manager or owner wasn't there to help! Another 10+ min with no service, we then realised, with only one cook this was going to take way too long and left. Never an ""I'm sorry "". Just an ok.  That was a $15 Uber down the drain"

I made sure to read the website description to find the place prior to arriving and still wasn't able to find it so I had to ask people on the streets. The place is out of nowhere amongst warehouses but once you are behind the parking lot, there's this beautiful brunch warehouse filled with cute decorations and pink glassware/dinnerware.The place is huge and wide open with communion tables, bars and a few bench tables. Communion tables have really cute decors on all of them on top. Service is really nice too. I thought food was pretty expensive and overpriced but they were actually pretty good. The omelet was served with grilled tomatoes, avocado, sauteed spinach and huge toasts. The yogurt with fruits was so fresh as well. I thought it was definitely a place worth to visit but probably not a everyday brunch restaurant. They are only open for brunch so make sure to check the hours of operations before getting out there."

The food here is good - you don't expect much for breakfast food as it tends to be the same everywhere you go. It's a really fun destination, in a warehouse district and easy to walk right past without noticing. Once you get inside it's a huge space that was once a warehouse or workshop of some sort and they've done an amazing job of transforming it into a fun and airy spot. A co-worker took me here. I had no idea what to expect but was thoroughly surprised and happy. I ordered a fruit salad with ricotta cheese because i wanted something light due to me just eating a cream cheese bagel prior. The fruit salad was amazing. You could taste the freshness in the fruit and tell they get fresh fruit daily. Co-worker got a egg omelet that looked real good.  The staff and owners deeply care about pleasing their customers,and it shows in myriad ways. It's a fun and satisfying hidden gem. Emphasis on hidden!  But worth the slight effort. Food was absolutely delicious and the ambience was steller.Highly recommended!"

It has a mysterious hipster millennial vibe and I always make a point to bring friends here and they love it.  Finding the place can be confusing but once you enter, ambience and interior is eye catching and you immediately want to take pictures. I always get the parmesan not so scrambled eggs and I like it because it has a nice spicy but not too spicy kick/flavor and the eggs are cooked to perfection.The only reason its not a 5 star is because of their weird policy of not being allowed to take pictures. Still do not quite understand the rationale behind that. Other than that, a cute cool brunch spot!"
1013,ohOXikd87wCxzJXKPx7nGg,10/20/2021,5 star rating,The aesthetics here were everything. Had a very relaxing late breakfast during the week. The waitress was very helpful in navigating through menu items. I selected the option with multiple side items and did not regret it! It was the perfect sample of multiple items. My fiancé got the scrambled egg dish and selected the chili and rice; the bite that I had was phenomenal. This was a very curated experience. Because I went during the week I could not advise on reservations or how quickly the dining turn around is because our party did take their time in ordering coffee/tea's and then onto food. Also we ubered so cannot advise on parking but it did look limited. I will say that the neighborhood was worth a walk around with the graffiti/art all around the industrial neighborhood.

Honestly my expectations were not that high because the food didn't seem too exciting but I was wrong.First of all, the interior is really cute and artsy. You are not allowed to touch any of the center pieces or take photos unless you're taking photos of your food but even then they limit it to only one or two. My friend was taking a few photos and the server/owner told us not to but in a polite way.As for the food, we ordered the chicken sandwich box and not so scrambled parmesan eggs! The portions were quite big and you get huge pieces of bread. Everything tasted so fresh and healthy! We didn't even get to finish everything. We also got ginger beer to share which was yummy.They gave us some kind of chocolate coconut caramel sea salt dessert on the house which was so sweet of them. This restaurant had a lot of odd rules but honestly the service was great so I didn't care. It was also cool how server was breastfeeding her child."

But other than that, the restaurant it's very spacious, strict rules on very limited photographs, delicious food and cute baby walking around! Food: the restaurant is more of a vegetarian based menu, I only saw one dish that had chicken and other than that, all veggies. But don't get me wrong, it's super delicious! I ordered the sandwich box with chicken and my friend had the not so scrambled eggs, it was humungous! My sandwich box came with a bed of cabbage, blueberries, cucumber, cilantro, tomatoes and boiled chicken. To be honest, the flavor was excellent. And it came with 2 HUGE slices of bread. My friend's scrambled egg was very good, it came with 2 slices of big bread, tomato and some greens. We ordered a glass of ginger beer, it was very refreshing. Service: the owner/waitress came over to us and asked us nicely if we can only take 1 photo, and not a few of the food. We agreed because this is their restaurant and the rule is no photo lol... but she was very nice about it and gave us 2 free dessert cookie on the house. There's only 1 chef, two waitress (owners) and one cute baby!! The baby kept coming to our table and smiling at us :))) this is a very cozy and friendly restaurant, just make sure, no excess photos.Overall, I will definitely come back because the food is so fresh!"
1017,ohOXikd87wCxzJXKPx7nGg,7/25/2017,4 star rating,"Way off the beaten path for brunch on a Saturday afternoon; only way you'd be able to get to this place is if you already know it exists. On the plus side, there is plenty of room in this giant establishment.Quirky place overall - giant common tables in what seems to be an old manufacturing warehouse. Nick knacks along with utensils in the middle of each table, a coffee station to the left, dishes/napkins piled up along the edges - just a completely different type of atmosphere. For food: ordered the ""Summer on Toast"" ($18) and a Ginger Beer ($4.50). While the prices are high, they certainly put a lot of effort into each dish. The toast is GIGANTIC - two large pieces of bread covered by many slices of fresh tomato, marinated goat cheese, and chili flakes. Not the easiest thing to eat, but filling and loaded with different flavors. Ginger beer has a great kick and paired well with the meal.Atmosphere here is key, it feels like a community meal served by a neighborhood family (literally, the numerous waiters were carrying around a child while taking orders). It's a cool concept and way different than the boozy brunches that litter the city. Would be nice if they had smaller portion sizes for a lower price - otherwise choose a meal and an appetizer to split."

I could tell that the food here is made of good quality ingredients, and the burrito really hit the spot!Fast forward a few days, and I found myself in this same area of the island. I made my way in, hoping for another outstanding meal. And I got just what I was looking for.The second time around, I went with a chicken burrito (vs the chicken fajita burrito). It was good!

They have touchscreens that you can place your order on, although someone walked in and ordered directly at the counter and they were fine with that. I ordered a salad with kale, spinach, corn, red peppers, cucumbers and chicken. It's $7.50 for 4 toppings and $8.50 for 5 toppings. There may also be an option for 6 but I just went with 5. The salad is large and very filling. Even with just those toppings, they added a lot of each and were not skimp on the chicken either, which was flavorful and juicy. They also have wraps, tacos, and quesadillas so I'll try something else next time."

I had a grilled chicken sandwich, chicken fajita taco bowl salad, and a Caribbean Sunset smoothie. The chicken was well seasoned on both dishes, but the taco bowl salad was a better choice than the sandwich because it came with many more toppings (corn, guacamole, etc.) It seemed like the food was prepared for a while before being given to us, because the toasted bread on the sandwich wasn't crispy anymore, like when hot bread is wrapped up and gets moist because of the condensation. The smoothie was good, but more watery than I would like. It could have used some yogurt."

Yeah I get you're trying to go for a vibe. But it is obviously widely known that many people seek out coffee shops to work on their laptops. If you're going to so harshly control what people do in your coffee shop, maybe bring that up when someone is first purchasing a coffee? ""Oh sir, I see you have a backpack. If you want to use your laptop, we only have 5 cramped chairs in the corner for you to fight over with all the other guests. If you don't want to be touching thighs with a stranger while you attempt to do work, then I would advise you not purchase a coffee here and waste your money.""

So the coffee isn't hot.   Neither of the 2 coffees I ordered was hot.  No darker roasts here, and although I'd never step into a sundollar establishment, I was yearning for something strong and hot because the cup of Joe served at Sey was way too fey."

A lot of pasta so they brought some back home for lunch the next day!! Our server wasn't that pleasant and kept leaving our food at the edge of the table to we had to reach over to get it which I found to be very annoying.

Hubby and I shared the Thai Chicken (Thai peanut sauce with Mozzarella, hearth-baked then topped with crisp bean sprouts, julienned carrots, slivered scallions and fresh cilantro.) which we LOVED.Fernando, our server, was helpful in identifying the best dishes to order based on our personal preferences. The Passion Fruit Mango Iced Tea is best when stirred and consumed quickly before the ice waters it down.I appreciate the attentiveness of our server as well as the manager who also checked in to see how we were doing. I loved the decor, the bar, and being able to see the pizza-making process. I am definitely considering downloading the app because I anticipate that we'll be regulars. Keep up the great work!"

I don't want to say ""just your average bar"", but it's not a cocktail bar, not a foofy/pretentious/exclusive bar, not a dive bar, not a hookah bar, not a tapas bar, not a tiki bar, so I guess it's just...a bar. With cheap drinks! What's not to like?Came here on a Saturday night around 11pm with three friends. Despite being conveniently-located (right off the L line), it actually wasn't too busy at this point. This actually surprised me, because the space lends itself to decently-sized crowds. There's a fair amount of seating here, but the center area could easily be converted to a dance floor at any moment. At 11 I suppose the clientele was more tame/sober, but I wouldn't be surprised if polite conversation turned to drunken dancing in the later hours. Overall, I was very impressed with the drink menu. They offer a handful of specialty cocktails as well as a very diverse selection of beers. I had already started with liquor for the night, so I went with one of their specialty martinis (gin, grapefruit, celery bitters...maybe one other thing I'm forgetting) which pretty much tasted like straight gin. This. Was. STRONG. Not sure I've ever taken that long to finish a drink. If I return, I'll definitely opt for a beer. They've got your more typical craft beers (Delirium Tremens) as well as a lot of local ales/IPAs. Best guess is they've got at least 20 beers on tap, maybe closer to 30. So while I won't call this a ""craft beer bar"" or a ""gastropub"" or ""beer hall"" - I am still called it ""just....a bar"" - beer drinkers rejoice!Come here if you're looking for a chill, no-frills bar that's a step up from a dive. The four of us were able to find seating in a booth (actually across from a couple, which was less awkward than expected......for us at least?) so you don't need to be overly-cautious about party size here.

I went at a quiet moment for them so I think they were catching up on other stuff, took a while to get their attention. But once you place the order, they serve it up pretty quickly. They have three booths at the other end of the bar if you come with a group but otherwise its mostly bar seating, though a lot of people were just standing around in a group in the middle.

The fact that goes until 8 means even if you get stuck at work, you still have a shot at a cheap drink.Select beers are $3 for happy hour, and the selection isn't bad! Last time I got the lionshead IPA. It is an easy place to hang out. My friends got drinks without much of a wait even though the bar was full. They have a great staff!! If you can, score a table near the door because it gets a little toasty in the back. But it's worth it for a seat. The bar isn't too loud and isn't too quiet. The perfect place for a chill happy drink. Enjoy!"
1056,uFRbWHqcD3mh5HX_vkQm8A,12/17/2017,5 star rating,"I've been hunting for a place like Drop Off Service for months. Is that sad? I don't think so. I like good beer! I like a lot of choices! I like it to be near the L! Don't judge me!I mean sure, I sampled a few too many beers that one night. And MAYBE getting the neat bourbon to cap off the night wasn't the best idea. But they had so many good looking beers! And they had my brand of bourbon! You can't blame me for getting a little excited and ordering pint after pint. You can't blame me for only seeing that they had my bourbon as I went to close my tab. You just can't. You don't know what it's like.And if you do, then you needn't worry any more. I found this place for you to try. It's called Drop Off Service, and it's the answer to all your prayers. How do I know? Because you're like me! You enjoy a well poured brew, or three or four. You enjoy a place that has regulars but doesn't pressure you into becoming one. You enjoy opening with an ale, following it with a nitro lager, and following that with a pils, because nobody can tell you how to drink a flight!I mean, I guess I just did, but don't listen to me. I don't know what I'm talking about. I like this place though!"

Was hit with an hour delivery window, so ordered in advance to time it just right for dinner.Between two people, ordered the Vodka Eggplant Parm ($14.50), ""Oh Emm Geee"" ($16), Corn Fritters ($8), and Fries ($5). Thankfully, the food was still warm by the time it arrived, since it was efficiently packed together. The ""Oh Emm Geee"" is a hot sub packed with chicken tenders, fried, bacon, and nacho cheese. Sounds like a heart attack and it definitely is; good flavor in the tenders and bacon. I would have preferred mozzarella over the nacho cheese to make it less sweet. Corn fritters are large handful of well fried corn bites served alongside a tangy aioli. Easy to eat and not overly breaded; does get greasy after a few, so best to share. Fries are fantastic, crinkle cut and just the right amount of salt. Items are best eaten straight away as the food can get greasy if sitting around. Would go for some classic options next time around."

1066,5Iq46XSngo4RoUAedDxK5g,3/30/2022,5 star rating,"Got takeout here a few times. First time I got the Veggie Philly, which comes with roasted Portobello mushrooms and roasted peppers. The seasoning was just right and ingredients all worked well together. Bread made the sandwich very good. The second time, I got the Goat sandwich which comes with goat cheese, caramelized onions, fig balsamic vinaigrette, arugula, avocado, etc. The bread made this one great as well. I wish the ingredients were more evenly distributed though.. I hate having all the onions on one side and cheese on the other. I would get it without the avocado next time. It didn't contribute much to the sandwich in my opinion. I have also had the tater tots here which have been hit or miss. The first time, they were too salty and not that crispy. Second time was way better and spot on with the crispiness. Staff is friendly. Music is very loud in there so I waited outside for my order. They also have cheesecakes that I haven't tried yet. Overall, I recommend this place."

I won't say that this chipotle is any better or worse in terms of food, I just REALLY enjoy that this location is the host of the NEXT kitchen where you can try all of the restaurants new experiments.

They also have outdoor seating so that's nice if you're not comfortable eating indoors. The staff was very welcoming, but service wasn't that great. For me it's really the small things that mean a lot. I was seated and nobody came to pour me a glass of water - the bottle was just sat on my table and then next time the waiter came back was to take my order. I ordered a sake (which came in a can that was difficult to open) and had to call someone over to help. I just felt like nobody was really attentive, but when it came time to tip - they lowest pre-selected option was 20% -.- I barely got 10% service.Anyways, the food was okay. The spicy pork bone ramen taste good, not too spicy. The pork was dry though and the ramen lacked veggies, which I like. It was scallions more than anything. I asked for extra veggies like the ones that come in the veggie ramen and didn't get those (still was charged the extra $1 tho). The sake is okay. They don't have any hot sake. And it is a lot of sake for an order, but I don't think the sake is strong. Anyways, good for a quick lunch I guess, but not impressed."

The broth was flavorful without being too salty, which is something I take note of, as so many places have really salty broths and I always have to drink so much water while eating! The pork slices were kind of thin and I felt that there weren't enough when eating the ramen, and kind of wished they gave just... one.. more slice.. to make it perfectly balanced. The noodles were a bit more cooked than my usual preferences, but still pretty good overall. Pork buns were a littler overpriced but still enjoyed it! Tip: The bathroom inside is kind of camouflaged b/c of the wallpaper but it's at the LEFT of the kitchen! I made the mistake of just going to the open area and it was the kitchen..."

It's currently fall and the chilly November air has whisked me onto this shop in search of something warm and comforting. With heavy carb-loaded noodles I opted  to start off with some fresh greens and ordered a kale salad. The salad had roasted corn, fresh cherry tomatos, finely chopped kale leaves, and topped with a fluffy pile of Parmesan cheese. The greens were tossed in a light citrusy vinaigrette. So delicious and refreshing! For the star entree, I ordered the Uni mushroom mazemen. Wow! Even though I miss a soupy broth in my ramen, this dry version is a MUST try if you are a fan of mushroom, scallion, green onion, and truffle oil. The uni flavor gets lost in the bowl and is over powered by the truffle. However, it adds a nice creamy note to the noodles. I'd be curious to see what die-hard ramen traditionalist would think of this dish."

They have lots of outdoor seating and the little booths are well-lit and even has heating for those chilly nights. We got seated right away and the service was speedy and efficient. I tried their classic Tonkotsu ramen (my go-to when it's my first time trying out a ramen shop) and was very happy with it. The broth was definitely the highlight of the bowl - it was flavorful without being too salty or making me want to drink a liter of water after. They are generous with most of their toppings (menma, green onions, wood ear mushroom) but the pork slices were very thin and small. The half egg was a pleasant surprise though! Last but not least, the noodles were thin and springy but just slightly too soft for my liking. Overall a good bowl of ramen that will satisfy your ramen cravings!"
1084,xrnk8mgoV7up6fauVmugpw,10/6/2021,4 star rating,"The ramen here was pretty solid! Like what many others have said, the soup is creamy but light and full of umami. The pork (although tinier pieces) was super tender and well seasoned. I like that this already has the addition of mushrooms, eggs and bamboo without any added cost. Certainly hits the spot ! The sweet potato fries were surprisingly tasty! Maple syrup was drizzled on the top which was a nice addition bc it tasted like a cozy dessert but then you have this mayo (mixed with something) that's savory and really good too. I don't know what it is but everything about these fries were fire."
1085,xrnk8mgoV7up6fauVmugpw,10/7/2021,4 star rating,"Friend and I got the uni truffle and the spicy pork bone broth ramen. The uni truffle is a dry ramen, and packs a full truffle flavor. While it has a cream sauce, it's not overly rich and enjoyed this dish.The spicy pork bone ramen was good too, and the spices added to the deep meat flavor, rather than just making the broth spicy. I would get this ramen specifically for the spices, although it's not really spicy for anyone who's looking for high spice levels. The noodles were a bit thinner and more cooked than I ideally like though."
1086,xrnk8mgoV7up6fauVmugpw,3/6/2022,4 star rating,"The ramen here is good. The spicy chicken ramen is not spicy at all, so be sure to ask for extra spicy stuff to add. I highly recommend the crunchy shrimp appetizer. That was my favorite. I also enjoyed the pork bun, but my friend said he's had better elsewhere. Service is very quick. There were only two problems: it's really small inside, so every time the door opens (it was winter), freezing cold air rushes in and is quite uncomfortable. This happens even if you are not sitting directly in front of the door. Also, do not come close to closing time because the servers become very rude and hostile."

Rich, fragrant pork broth. Silky, but chewy ramen noodles. Tender chashu and al dente eggs. Topped with a drizzle of BLACK GARLIC OIL (their secret weapon)! Perfect combination of flavor and texture.

It was decent and great, but pricey, but considering it is in Chelsea which is what the price in this neighborhood. The noodles are not al dente, but more wheat like which I also like.

First time I went I got takeout (sushi deluxe) but I've since gone back for dine-in lunch (sushi lunch special) and dinner (chirashi).There's no outdoor dining, but they will occasionally open the front windows completely to ensure good air circulation (unless it's a sweltering heat wave). The prices are very reasonable and they have some good dinner and lunch specials too. The fish selection is great. And everything was fresh and well proportioned (I feel like giant pieces of sushi are always a bad sign). No alcohol yet but they look like they plan to have a modest selection of sake, wine and beer once their liquor license comes in."

Make sure you order from grubhub or doordash if you decide to eat here anyway, so you can get a refund if things go south. I ordered food and paid for it. They let me know it was ready for pickup, but when I arrived, my food was nowhere to be found. Perhaps they gave it away, who knows. They told me my order was not there. Instead of helping me get my food, they first had me wait 20 minutes, and then shooed me away. They seemed surprised I waited so long to find out what happened to food I paid for (I showed them the receipt from their restaurant). Terrible service, disorganized, and not worth it for blah food."

We ordered the whole chicken combo with pita, 2 sides (we ordered corn on the cob and Mac and cheese) and 2 sodas (we ordered Sprite). We also added a small order of nuggets. The whole chicken was very good and they placed it well in the packaging instead of just throwing it in like most places. The corn on the cob was good but they only gave us one. The Mac and cheese was gross, it tasted like Kraft Mac and cheese with extra elbows thrown in to stretch out the cheese. The chicken fingers were good but they were basically Purdue or Tyson nuggets which were deep fried. The soda wasn't the right soda, they sent us Sierra Mist. The delivery fast. The most important parts were very good but if the sides were better and the orders more accurate, I'd give them 4 stars."

I get it at least once a week, at most four :). I love their salad, rice and poke bowls. I always build my own, not because they have don't have good selection already but I'm just picky. I feel like that's the reason for all the negative reviews, it's all subject to taste. Those who left bad reviews should give health kitchen one more try and build their own items personal to their tastes. The only thing I don't like from them is their smoothies, I just feel they aren't fruity enough mostly milk. I am not taking a star off for that because I've gotten smoothies for my mom and brother and they've loved them, so again subject to taste. I'm about to order and build my own smoothie to give it one more chance though :)One thing I wish is they had more selection for the BYO poke.

The food was very fresh- even being fresh cut for the day right as I was ordering! Nothing was greasy or weird and the veggies were very fresh. The portion size was great- you definitely get a good serving and the price was reasonable. The restaurant was also very clean and modern- seems new.

We ordered from the ""Specialties of Spain"", I always try the specialty of any place I  visit. As this ha a Spanish restaurant , we had   paella a la valenciana  and matched it with sole stuffed with crab meat. Paella was served in a sizzling pot and could served 2. It was very delicious. The sole was so tasty . We were happy with our meal. Surprised though for our Sunday lunch price  was the same as dinner price where in there were less choices. We came very early for lunch hour and were the first clients inside the restaurant.  Never got the chance to try dessert. Too full with what we had but I heard of good reviews of their crepes. I'll try that next time.I recommend this place. A perfect place for any family gathering. The downside is looking for parking as it is located along a busy street."

And secondly after an 8 hr fucking bus ride with the 2 suitcases I have no hands to Cary a paper bag and a giant soda. I asked for either a soda holder bag or a bag with handles and was told they didn't have any. While I'm directly looking at paper bags with a handle n the dumbass cashier still said no.

Came in on Sunday night and went to order 2 bacon double cheeseburgers, the cashier (who btw was far from friendly), rung me up for 2 bacon DOUBLE whoppers ON A BRIOCHE BUN... I don't know where i mentioned brioche bun anywhere in the order but ok. I decided to take the L and just say nothing and leave a nice survey receipt comment online (the ones where you get a free whopper). Now here is where it gets funny, I open two wrappers to these sandwiches and i'm greeted by undercooked meat ON ALL 4 PATTIES . At this point i laugh and then to add salt to the wound, there is no bacon present on any of the whoppers!So here's where i had enough and went up to let them know that 1. My order was taken wrongly 2. There's no bacon on any of these wrong sandwiches, and 3. The dang meat is undercooked. At this news one of the workers came and threw the whoppers in the trash while another came with an attitude asking what were the sandwiches i wanted, to which i replied 2 bacon double cheeseburgers. Now to add, i'm being calm and nice to all of them because i just did not want to cause a scene in the place or create a huge hassle, which is why i took the L on paying for the whoppers in the first place. So this employee fixes the order and hands me the two fixed sandwiches, No apology or anything.All in all it was a hilariously horrible experience, the attitude, the miscommunication, all of that. I just ate my burgers (that were cooked, and with bacon, although it looked like a quarter slice of bacon was put in each burger) and left swiftly. Doubt i'll come back unless super desperate for a burger, but i doubt it'll be at this location"

The party starts late here so when we arrived around 11pm it wasn't uncomfortably packed yet. It's definitely a cozy neighborhood bar also known for great drag shows. Our old a** selves only stuck around around for the first set. The second one was after 2am! That WAY passed my bedtime. But so fun! The staff are super fun and friendly.  They also had a coat check which was a nice touch. A fun place indeed. And if you're a local looking for a fun and open to all bar....this is it!

The patio is cute, the drag queens are amazing and very talented. All around my fav Brooklyn spot. I'd go at the beginning of your night or very late to have the best time."

I love the live jazz they have on Thursdays through Sunday, and it's Free! So tip the band and tip your bartender so we can ensure the Jazz remains a key attraction. Ambience is chill and sexy. BUT the kitchen section / kitchen lighting is definitely a SORE EYE! It ruins the vibe, but it looks like once the proper kitchen is up and running that it will better assimilate into the interior of the space. Love the plants and booths. I think they could use some sort of soft spotlight over the mirror that is the drink lists. No one can tell that's where they should be looking for drinks and it's also waay to the left of the bar. Get a better spotlight!I'd also like to make a special callout to the bar-back who has been beyond attentive: every time I've been there, he is always bringing the band cold water and started bringing it to guests too! What an awesome hospitality detail that DEFINITELY did not go unnoticed.In terms of drinks, I'd stick with the classic cocktails for $11. The price is right!  If you're in the mood to splurge for a specially cocktail, try the one with Mezcal! Called Daddy's Water Burns."

So overall it's just an okay-ish French restaurant-- maybe 3 stars at best but giving 2 now.I don't think we'd go there again, nothing special. Also doesn't accept major credit cards (only Amex).

To drink, we ordered a bottle of the Californian Brut. It was a little on the sweet side, but not overwhelming. It was also refreshing for a warm day. To eat, we ordered the steak frites with peppercorn sauce. It took a little while to come out but it was awesome! The steak was juicy and seasoned well.The fries were hot and crunchy. I soaked up the excess peppercorn sauce with the slices of baguette they gave us. It was all so delicious.For dessert, we went with the famous French staple, the creme Brûlée.

I came here today and the noodles were alright not as great. I also got their breaded shrimp with walnuts and their orange chicken. The breaded shrimp was lackluster. Tasted really soft instead of chewy. The orange chicken was super filling. Service is on the rather slower side. They always give you a fortune cookie which I find cute.

The shrimp was soggy - not crispy AT ALL. and the noodles were overly greasy. I had about 3 bites and wound up throwing the rest out. What a waste of $10."

I asked so I don't understand when do you stop making food she said usually around 7, or 7:30. So I guess the food sitting out is almost two hours old and that's the standard? Gross.

This is a Taiwanese chain dessert parlor with their versions of sagos, boba drinks and other gelatinous desserts. It is a big location with seating, a gem to find in NYC as most dessert places are hole-in-the-walls. Taste-wise the desserts are average to me and the same goes for my winter melon tea. It didn't have that depth semi sweet tea kick taste, more watered down and their taro boba balls were chewy but tasted like water. Not the experience I was expecting as I love gelatin desserts and chewy pearls. Maybe it was this Meet Fresh location and should give another place a chance."

I've tried their other items and it was only okay, hence the 1 star dock. Price: They are bit on the pricey side but I don't get it often so it's okay. Service: 4/5 - I feel indifferent about their service. They don't really go above and beyond. They take your order, buzz you when your order is done and you clean up after yourself. Food: 4/5 - As I mentioned before, I usually get the same thing every time I come here because the other items were only okay. I've tried their Q Mochi Milk Shaved Ice, Tofu pudding with taro balls, a few of their drinks, and the Icy Grass Jelly Signature (my fav). Icy Grass Jelly Signature - As if you didn't catch on, this is my favorite haha. This dessert is perfect for a hot summer day! This dish based with half grass jelly ice and half grass jelly topped with taro balls, taro paste, creamer and ice cream. The taro balls have such a great chewy texture. Meet Fresh's taro balls are probably my favorite taro balls. Next time, I would probably order it without the taro paste. I was not a fan of the texture. It was too paste-y. I ended up taking it out. If they used condensed milk instead of creamer, it would make this dessert even better! Q Moshi Milk Shaved Ice - I recommend you share this. It's pretty big. I liked the toppings but the ice part lacked flavor. Maybe if they had less ice, you can taste the flavoring of the ice more. Tofu Pudding - I think this was only okay and overpriced. I can get a more authentic tofu pudding in Chinatown for a cheaper price. Drinks - Their drinks weren't memorable. It tasted like drinks I can get elsewhere."

While eating I feel like I was biting down on sand or dirt. I thought it was quinoa but the hard texture convinced me it must be something else. Unfortunately by that time I already ate 1/4 of the salad (I threw away the rest). What really convinced me that it was not a clean salad was that I experienced pretty bad stomach pain and diarrhea in the next few hours.

Their pastries are unique flavors and good across the board, plus not terribly priced (though they could be $1-2 cheaper). The matcha though - the best that I have had, maybe ever; And, it's served in a large, patterned ceramic glazed mug atop a matching coaster that was very cute and added presentational value.

It's one of many bakeries in the Woodside neighborhood of Queens but definitely a standout. I got the bunuelo and pandebono and they were perfectly warm treats on such a cold afternoon. Both were very crisp and the sweetness was subtle. When you split the pastries in half, you get a steamy aroma and each one was only $1.30!! The interior bakery was also very sleek and clean and provided a great environment to stop by and enjoy treats. I highly recommend stopping by Rico Pan bakery to get a taste of one of the many, many diverse tastes that woodside has to offer."

It's very smooth, not bitter and very fresh. At 1.20$ for a small it's pretty damn good. The pastries are very fresh as well. They do use a ton of butter in their pastries but I ain't mad at it. The Colombian cheese bread thing is delicious! They have many different types of croissants. The one with ham and cheese is my fave. I really can't wait to try their savory foods. The paying system is interesting... You pay the person at the counter across with a pink stickie as your receipt. I believe it's cash only but everything here is under $5. Great little spot."

I loved the ordering experience, really streamlined and low-contact, which is useful in the pandemic era but also nice for people (like me) who don't like social interaction much. The person behind the counter was really nice, offering to help me with the menu because I couldn't see very well with my glasses fogged up. The menu was pretty expansive, so I may update if I do back and try some of the more interesting sounding sides.This time, I got the hot tenders with fries, and. I really wanted to like it, but I was pretty disappointed. The tenders themselves were tiny and it felt like so few--if I hadn't gotten the fries as well it would have felt like nowhere near enough food. The tenders themselves were fine, though I found the breading itself a little dry and the spice blend a little overpowering. I think the best of the dipping sauces ended up being the one it came with, but I really liked the other two I ordered as well. I wish one of them meshed well with the fries as well, but none of the sauces felt fry-appropriate in taste or consistency. And then I passed on the bread entirely, it would have been cool to be able to switch that for a vegetable of some sort or cole slaw.The employee there was really really nice not just to me, but to the rest of the customers who came in while I was there.

Since a new branch is now opened in my neighborhood, I made a pit stop to warm up while shopping in the area. The store is cute in its design even though it's small. The chairs were comfortable, although the bench seating wasn't. There was only one person working the front and when a few patrons come in, it creates a backlog since she stops taking orders to make the drinks. There is another guy in the back making food orders. I ordered a hot Japanese Matcha Milk Tea with bubbles. I like that it came in this cute and durable cup and it was actually quite good. It had a milky and creamy texture but not too thick or powdery. I can taste the matcha flavor without it being too bitter. A solid cup overall. Next time, I may give the popcorn chicken a try. It seems pretty good. This place may give Kung Fu Tea some solid competition!"

By the time I got my drink (3 orders later), all the ice had MELTED. Think about being excited to take a sip of a refreshing cold drink on a summer day to find that it is room temperature!!!

Expect at least a 10 minute wait - fairly normal if you've been to the other locations.  They make them fresh and always tastes so good.  They have several different flavors.  My go to has always been the salt and pepper, spicy and garlic.  Quick and good snack, each order of popcorn chicken comes out to about 4$ (including tax).  **THEY TAKE CARD (w/ a minimum)** - even better - other vivis dont."

Came here after lunch nearby since they're having a BOGO deal on 5 of their drinks to celebrate their grand opening. I tried all 5 flavors and my favorite is still my go-to, the 3Q, which has tapioca, grass jelly, and pudding. I think they made it better here than they did at the Chinatown location. The one I had in Chinatown was too bland while the one here had the right amount of sweetness. The Red moo milk and Passionfruit QQ were also good but I didn't really like the Earl grey and Peach ice jelly. I also tried the Basil popcorn chicken and it was good. It's not as crispy as the one at Chicken V a couple of blocks away but I think the meat here tasted better. The place looks really cute and sort of looks like a house from the outside. The cashier was really nice but service was a big problem. It took us like 20 mins to get our drinks after we ordered because they were severely understaffed. I don't blame them since they just opened and since it's the first day of the new year. Hopefully they manage to fix this asap. Will be back :)"

They have Taiwanese bbq sausages. It's sweet and savory. They're 1 for $2 or 3 for $5. They're pretty good. They also have fries, corn dogs and etc snacks. I got their galaxy drink and it was gross at first, but then I remembered I was supposed to mix it. After mixing the drink, it was quite refreshing and delicious. I like their kumquat jelly drink. It's great for your throat! On the downside, they seemed understaffed. Sometimes the wait can be a little long. The last few times I came here there was only 1 staff managing the front."

One large pie to go I uttered to the dude behind the counter and a few more texts are coming my way , chicken parmesan hero , sausage roll, lasagna, garlic knots , 2 rice balls and a few scratch off lottery tickets as well.

When I got home I did grab a slice even though I was not that hungry and overall it was not that bad even if it was a bit  burnt on the crust part .

However the music was on point, mixture of reggaeton, hip hop, RnB, bachata etc. I find it to be a little overpriced when it comes to drinks and hookah, but I understand it's because of the location. Our waiter was attentive and brought everything out in a timely manner. The margarita pitcher was overpriced but tasted decent.

Being Chinese myself, it is at times hard not to to expect that every take out place serving Chinese be of minimum quality. Knowing that, this place is still very disappointing. I ordered a Beef lo mein, and got a beef chop suey on rice instead. I also ordered a young chow fried rice, a popular Chinese fried rice, and mysteriously got a fried (if you can even call it fried) rice that looked nothing like what you would normally receive at even the worst Chinese restaurants. The biggest offense is that they somehow find a need to put fake crab sticks in the fried rice, an oddity I had never seen until today. Additionally, it was totally bland and nasty. So I will say that I will no longer be ordering from here, despite the ridiculously fast delivery and relatively cheap food. It did not even meet my lowest expectations."
1281,Qj5Wvq6jufSFgJd4dDb_Sg,2/24/2016,5 star rating,"I never understand all the hate this place gets on Yelp and Seamless. I've ordered from many Chinese takeout restaurants in Astoria, only to get dismal food and measly portions. East Garden nails it and for such stupidly cheap prices-- I can eat for days from one order here. I'm a huge fan of the Beef with Broccoli, and always get the egg rolls which are flaky and flavourful. They also make a mean fried wonton. The food is always delivered fresh, hot, and fast, even though I live a pretty decent distance away. Never had any issue with missing food or buggered orders. Hands down the most solid, delicious, and quick Chinese takeout I've found in Astoria."
1282,Qj5Wvq6jufSFgJd4dDb_Sg,1/25/2015,4 star rating,"Gotta give it to this place. I saw a lot of bad recent reviews and was hesitant, but the $7 minimum on Seamless attracted me. I ordered the Hunan chicken lunch special. I'd usually order a sesame chicken but I was wary of ordering anything fried based on past reviews. My order came in 20 minutes, hot and fresh. Big plus. Also they give huge portions. Wonton soup was just okay but came with 5 wontons instead of the normal 2 or 3. The actual food had lasted me 2 meals. One con and that's that I ordered brown rice which they forgot but no big deal. As far as Chinese takeout goes, 4 stars, but probably closer to 2 or 3 in the big picture. It's a standard Chinese takeout."

I called to place an order for pickup. (Granted, it's the day before thanksgiving, I know it's busy)When I called to place the order, she immediately put me on hold. I was already driving to the location, and I timed my call at 9 minutes on hold. During this time, she was still answering the phone, AND taking orders from the people already there.  I hung up and called back and again she immediately put me on hold. I waited another 8 minutes on hold and when she picked up I said wow, 17 minutes later... I'm already almost at the location. Instead of apologizing, (which I would've appreciated!!!! I worked at a restaurant before) she said well the customers that walk in need to be taken care of first.My immediate reaction was, ""How is that acceptable to people calling in to try and place orders?"" She said, ""Well it's busy and I had other orders to take."" Her attitude was super nasty, she didn't even try to help and not ONCE apologized. So whoever is working this shift at 2:48 AM 11/28/19, you caused this 3 Star review. Will NEVER return to this location again. Better off going to another location or another empanada spot."

My friends and I got one of EVERY flavor, even the desserts (which I didnt like lol) My all tome favorites were the cheeseburger, cuban, and hotdog!!! They are so crispy on the outside with the perfect amount of filling per bite. I never felt like I had to portion control each bite and ration out the dough to filling. Everything from the price point, service, and flavor exceeded my expectations and it is now my new go to empanada spot!!"

I tried 4 different types, and they were all great. If you're in Queens, definitely try this place.I tried the Chicken de Trigo, beef w corn shell, bacon egg and cheese, and the pizza flavor. The green sauce is a MUST!!! The chicken was my favorite because I.T had a bit of curry/cumin inside I.T.I also tried the side dish of the chicharonn with arepa. I.T was cooked perfectly and everything tasted homemade."
1288,ZYWwYSXWyDlVYIjPgXmIQA,8/20/2020,4 star rating,"Love this place !! There's always you go to Colombian beef empanadas or even chicken but here there's sooo many options.  My only complaint is the corn dough could be a bit thick for my liking. However the fillings are tasty and you can be adventurous. The sauces are good and you get a few to try from. Flour, corn, baked, fried. All yesss! Aside from the Colombian ones my favorites are the Hawaiian and pernil. Also if you want to top it off with a dessert empanada. I highly Recommend the Arequipe and cheese. Heaven !!!"

Then eat them while sitting in traffic for the Queensboro bridge.  They are hot, slightly greasy, and delicious. The flavor selection is great. You can get either corn or flour. This is not low cal or healthy eating by any stretch, but they will make your heart sing. And the price is great $2 to 3 dollars per empanada (some are even cheaper!). They are worth the ride out to Queens or a slight detour heading in to Manhattan. If you live in the area and haven't tried them you should."
1290,ZYWwYSXWyDlVYIjPgXmIQA,12/29/2016,1 star rating,"Empanadas were decent, but they take forever to make!!! Quoted time: 10-15 min. Actual time: 45 min. It wasn't even a large order! (Ordered only 6 empanadas).I don't mind waiting, but there's nothing that pisses a customer off more than giving erroneous wait times. Oh and they call numbers at random. I got a similar size order as someone else and they called her number before mine.  I get that they have a lot of large orders but waiting more than 10-15 min for a small order is pretty ridiculous no matter how busy you are. If that's the case, either hire more staff or figure out a better system for taking orders.If I hadn't already paid, I would've walked out after the 20 min. mark. By 30 minutes,I really wanted to just get a refund and go home after a long day. Don't come here if you were expecting a fast snack. Go only during off hours. Suggestion to management: be really clear and accurate with the wait times. Misrepresenting wait times just to make a sale is really bad business."

I would recommend this place to everyone, I love the chicken parm and pizza empanadas, I usually get a bunch of different ones and the green sauce that goes with it is is amazing with the flaky layering outside of the empanada.

Or whether its Pat or any of the other bartenders you will always leave here feeling happy ,full and thankful for the libations. The kitchen delivers one of the best RibEye steaks anywhere in New York. My wife would testify its better than Smith & Wollensky or Ruth Charles. The owner and his family have taken the time  to not only serve the finest of eatables ,but hire a dream team to run this Queens Irish pub .

1298,xGwVfRSgkuuQGUSEa2d7uw,11/7/2015,2 star rating,"Been here a few times (not by choice obviously). Food is mediocre across the board. Wings are the standout here... specifically the Insanity wings which are verrrrry hot and delicious. Salads are large. The chopped chicken salad was an odd combination of vegetables... celery, carrots, lettuce, tomatoes, broccoli, mushrooms... It was just all over the place. Chicken pot pie was by far the worst pot pie I've ever had in my life. Chicken pot pie is something I cook frequently at home (and if I do say so myself, it's pretty damn good!), so I know a good chicken pot pie when I see (eat) one. I cannot even describe how disgusting this was. Oversalted, the puff pastry was oddly salty, and filled with what can only be described as fake cheese and fake chicken. I ate less than 1/3 of the pot pie. Waitresses are across the board slow with service. I say this having been here four different times that I can remember and having similar experiences every time. Drinks - good joint for beer, not so much for wine. They don't have a pinot noir or a chardonnay. Umm...what do you have then? How can this be considered a legitimate drinking establishment if you have two types of red wine? All questions that are still unanswered."
1299,xGwVfRSgkuuQGUSEa2d7uw,3/24/2016,5 star rating,Nice Irish Bar. Beers are fairly priced and food was good. Chicken wings were a little small but still good. The best part of the night was the trivia game. Go Team Frito's. Overall a great night.

We sat at the bar and ordered some food. I ordered the lobster bisque and cheese quesadilla and washed it down with water. The food was okay at most. But it got worse come 5 AM when I felt sick. I woke up with the worst stomach pain ever and ran to the bathroom. I like to think that I have a strong stomach and foods don't tend to bother me, but there was something about the food that wasn't right. I gave two stars because the bartender was cool and I like that they have trivia nights."

1304,yLqxASXt1i-JzYOhKpKFjg,11/25/2019,5 star rating,"Easily the best coffee in LIC/Astoria and probably the rest of Queens! I don't know what kind of beans they use, but they brew the best cup: full-bodied, well-balanced, rich, warm, heavy with notes of caramel. No burnt bitterness, ultra smooth, but still robustly flavored   Seriously so good. Their specialty lattes are fantastic, too. The rose latte and lavender latte have a pronounced floral flavor but it's not overwhelming, and it's balanced out well with the coffee; I thought it might be weird to combine floral flavors with coffee, but it totally works. And they aren't too sweet. The plain espresso drinks are also so good. Maybe the best part, though, is how friendly and welcoming all the staff are. Definitely worth going out of your way!"

I saw someone doing work, but I would probably rather socialize here because there are only 2-3 tables and glass windows (free WiFi though). If a meticulous teenage girl with Paris dreams decided to make her bedroom into a cafe, it would probably look like this. :) Coffee prices are standard, but I'm happy I can get a solid rose or lavender latte without having to venture out to Remi's in Midtown East! Service is good too."

After an online order, the app said my order would be ready in 30 min. I get there and get a receive a text that my order is ready. I kept asking them if they have it, to which they said no, while everyone including the people making food are goofing off and not being diligent about the hoard of customers outside the door waiting for their food. After waiting for another 20 minutes I go in and ask for my order and they magically find it sitting there for over 20 minutes. Whatever, I take my food and leave through the crowdsof people cursing at Shake Shack outside the door. I go home and guess what?They got the order wrong. Again, would have been my go-to, but nope not happening. I'll take my money elsewhere. Even the McDonalds down the street has better customer service than this location. I have filed a complaint with corporate on behalf of my experience as well as all the other people standing outside the door, starving, with the people inside ignoring them & not giving them the food that they ordered."

I think I waited about 15 minutes inside for my order - which really sucks right now during Covid times. It's also on the second floor with only one set of stairs going up to it, which is super annoying since I didn't want to use the elevators during this time. When I got my order, I dipped as soon as I could, and didn't check the order. I should've, because one of our burgers are missing from the order. I put in a service ticket to customer service and they made it right, but it was super disappointing because we had driven out from Jersey City to get Shake Shack (yes, I was craving it).

There's an employee that comes around and throws your trash, such a sweet ol lady.Food:-Shack Stack: It's a cheeseburger w/ a shroom burger, lettuce, tomato and shack sauce. I love the shroom burger! It's a fried portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese!. So yummy and flavorful.-Cheesy Fries: I'm not sure what kind of cheese sauce they use, but it's amazing!

Not today.There is a high school across the street and I understand that sometimes the location can get busy with kids, and with a mob of high school kids sometimes you have to be short and firm but there is a guy there who I think is either a manager or an owner who I think is just rude in general. Probably late 40s / early 50 Indian guy. When i walked in there were 3 kids leaving, and another 3 kids just sitting at a table being quiet. I walked into the non-existant line since there was 1 person in front of me, an Asian woman and her son getting sandwiches, and 2 employees. One was a normal Subway worker with the collared polo short uniform, and the older guy with glasses who had a button down shirt on so I'm gonna assume he's like a manager / hopefully not the owner. Anyway, I guess Subway is running some sort of 2 for 1 buy one get one promo thing, but the lady just asked the guy to confirm ""excuse me sir, but how much are the sandwiches going to be if I don't have the coupon?"" Mr Dress Shirt rudely snarled at her ""$6.50 ...you should know this you here all the time"" (Is he saying all asians look the same? haha) The lady was shocked and was like ""Sorry sir I've never been here before"" and he replies ""Where are you from?"". The lady is totally shocked at this point, and I'm annoyed because I have to sit here and listen to all this when i just want to get back on to the rooftop to finish my mural. She's like ""I'm from China sir, why does that matter?"" The guy goes ""China? I'm from China. I'm Indian China. Indian China. Me India China"" and the lady in her broken english was like ""well i'm sorry sir but do you speak chinese? I could speak to you easier"" The guy was like ""yes I speak chinese. Ching chong. ching chongggg""I looked up from my little bubble of instagram bliss...Oh word? Ching Chong?Mind you. We are in Chinatown. Also. I'm half Taiwanese and half German. I'm just shy of 6 foot tall and have quite a bit of gravitational pull. I don't look like a typical Taiwanese person. More like a Samoan or in NY, some sort of latin decent since people always assume and speak to me in spangish and shit. Tu sabe.He asks me what kind of bread I want. He starts making my sandwich while still saying ""ching chonggg ching chonggg"" to the other lady who's paying at the register. At that point, I'm thinking to myself ""yo fuck this place.""I'm pissed but i'm still pretty calm. At first, I say in Mandarin ""Excuse me"", but he doesn't understand me or acknowledge me, so at this point, I'm like ""ummm..excuse me sir, but I'm half Taiwanese. This woman you are speaking to like this, you could be saying this type of stuff to my mother for all you know. I'm not really finding this cool at all and frankly I'm pretty offended. You have high school students sitting in here and you should be setting an example for kids instead of being a blatant racist. I think you should just learn how to be quiet and do your job man and make sandwiches."" This dude starts back pedaling and is like ""I'm sorry brother. It's a joke. It's a joke brother i'm sorry"" and i'm like ""My man..you really fuckin suck at jokes then.""At that point it's mad awkward and he asks me if I still want my sandwich. I'm like ""Yes, this is why I came in here"" and he proceeds to make it. He asks me if I want it toasted and at that point I told him ""Nah actually, if you could wrap that up and shove it up your ass, that would be great you racist piece of shit. Fuck you. I'm not spending money in this place to support your racist bullshit"" He kinda just looked at me kind of shocked like he didn't understand the concept  and I told him again ""I'm not trying to spend my money in this place. You're a racist piece of shit and you need to learn some act right"". At that point I'm laughing at him and he's freaking out like ""you get out..you get out now"" and I'm like ""dude, didn't I just say fuck you, I'm out, fuck this place I'm leaving? I'll be outside, but if you would like to come outside and speak Chinese to me I got your ching chong right here.""I ended up going across the street to some other place to get a sandwich. When i walked in the lady was training some new dude on customer service and was like ""sorry sir, i'm busy I'll be with you in a moment"" then told him that you need to acknowledge customers to make them feel welcomed. She was cool the place was cool and i left them a 4 dollar tip on a 6 dollar sandwich just to say FU to the other dude.I'm boycotting this Subway for sure. Wish I could give that guy negative stars."
1335,SYQwo6Ikr38GqwKEHuDIpQ,1/15/2013,1 star rating,"Bait and switch. Let me start by saying that I used to work at a Subway. Not in NY,  but in Southern IL.  I know how Subway works, and how to order a sandwich, etc. Long story short, I ordered the $5 footlong special of the month, which was the chipotle chicken. I got buffalo sauce on it instead of chipotle. They charged me $6.25. I kinda flipped out, and argued with the guy, but still bought the sandwich. During our arguing about the price of the sandwich the person at the register (and older man w/ glasses) informed me that we had already had this conversation and that I yelled at him and didn't pay for a sandwich. THAT NEVER HAPPENED! I had only been there once, and had no such altercation. So I guess this happens a lot at this Subway.PS they keep there spinach under the counter, I'm guessing that is so you will not order it. Lame."

You can come here after a night of drinking since they are open Late Night.The place is surprisingly clean and well maintained. Good corner location too.

Said so on the commercial that it was buy one get one ANY 6inch sandwich, but when i was about to pay, I realize its all a scam ( or this store just don't want to do it)! I've been a long time customer to this location, but the service was never better (Or they're just don't like me, grr). But I continued to visit because it's one of the cleanest Subway! So I tried to explain to the staff that it does not limit to breakfast sandwich, but all he said was ""my manager told me so, breakfast sandwich only!""Ok, I gave up, and asked if I can just switch the sandwich to the breakfast sandwich, he said no. I asked why, he said it's less meat, so I said ok, take out the meat, he still said no. What pissed me off the most what was he said that made me walked out and never want to come back, this is what he said ""you take it or leave"". Ok... I'm in customer service area myself, so I thought why did these ppl even bother to work, they just seem like a bunch of animals and don't bother to solve problems. Why do they even bother to work in United States with this kind of attitude?( ok, I was being a lil mean in the last sentence, but that's what I truely feel like) Whatever, if there's a complaint hotline, I would totally dial it RIGHT NOW!"

1341,SYQwo6Ikr38GqwKEHuDIpQ,8/3/2012,1 star rating,"BEWARE OF THIS SUBWAY!Make sure you check the prices from the menu and ask for prices before you add anything to your sandwich. The manager/owner has a habit of adding extra to the bill. In one instance charging $4 extra for double the meat (seriously?) and yesterday the manger told me they didn't have any eggs with a straight face...over a full tray of it in plain sight next to the chicken breasts. I think to myself wtf was that rotting cheddar? So I point to it and with a look of confusion the manager tells me it will cost $1 extra to add eggs to the $5 foot long special...Yup that's right he had the balls to tell me it will cost extra to make my sandwich look like this month's $5 special (black forest ham+eggs+spinach on a 12"" flatbread).He then proceeds to give me FIVE spinach leaves, I'm sure the standard was four but he must have been feeling generous after shortchanging me eggs.Oh no it's not over, he then tops it off by trying to charge me the full price of almost $7...I point it out and this time he apologizes as if it was by mistake.I'm NEVER coming back to this money hungry branch and neither should you.There are tons of other fair Subway branches out there that lives up to their ads to satisfy customers."

I order breakfast with a hi-c orange drink which they gave me orange soda???? And ordered a white cheddar bacon McMuffin and received a egg McMuffin??? It's apparent they don't  care about what your order vs what you get and I can't even say they make mistakes because they are fast because it is the worst managed McDonald's I have ever been to.

We decided to order: --PORK XIAO LONG BAO: The soup dumplings were cooked perfectly. Nice thin skin, great savory broth and good amount of filling. The vinegar and ginger it came with for dipping was a great compliment for the dish. --Wonton Noodle Soup: A really large portion of noodles and soup. The noodle was cooked perfectly and the soup was yummy. The wontons were delicious and loaded; however, there were only four provided- I wish there were more. --DOUBLE SAUTÉED PORK: Very saucy dish so it goes very well with rice. Good amount of veggies and pork. All in all, a solid takeout place and definitely on my list the next time I'm looking for some quick and delicious dumplings."

While they added different condiments to make it special, it sort of deferred from the authentic type of yang Zhou fried rice. The potstickers were nice, but nothing special. Same for the beef noodle soup. Would not be opposed to coming here again if my friends want to eat here, but would not come for any other reason"

We chose this place since it also offered a vegetarian (non soup) dumpling option for someone in our group and it certainly delivered! Their veg dumplings were also well liked. The chicken dumpling soup was a surprise hit for the table. We liked that their scallion pancakes were more fully cooked than most places. The pork buns were the absolute highlight. I will definitely be back here! Location was great too and service was friendly and quick. Casual interior, typical Chinese restaurant with basic seating etc but the food was definitely worth the lack of ambience."

I would not be eating outside with the smell and it doesn't help the train station is right on the corner. Inside had power tools laying around and right by the entrance is there jug of water. Which is out in the open and that's what they are serving you. Bottled water only. Trust me. So I decided to eat in the car and see if this place was a hidden gem just at a bad location. Nope. I had ordered the General tsos chicken was not meaty at all and after a few bites I bit into ""something"" crunch , like a bone but trust me this didn't have bones. It wasn't cooked well and can be seen with the breading still soft and mushy. Pork Xiao long Bao was ok. By itself I was not impressed. It wasn't horrible but I would not be coming back here. They got two stars because I could see the staff really trying and attend to the customers."

Lunch specials are what we found interesting on their online menu only to learn that they don't have lunch specials anymore at the restaurant.The place was empty and we were the 2nd customer at around 12:30 on a sunny Tuesday afternoon. I got the Steamed Mushroom & Vegetable Dumpling (6 Pcs.) - $8.25 which weren't that excellent but weren't bad either/ I also got the Chinese Vegetable with Garlic Sauce Noodle Soup ($8.75) which was not that great because the soup was sweet; I was hoping it'd have been a little spicy. We requested our server to give us some spicy sauce which didn't really cut the sweetness by much either - that's how sweet it was.Food prices are reasonable, and overall service was good and quick."

One of my friends went allllll the time when she was living in London and raved about it so we had to try it out. We all got the same thing: a latte with vanilla milk and an extra shot. It was perfectly bold, not acidic, a little bit sweet, and very thick & creamy. One of the coffees came out without an extra shot, but the baristas were happy to fix the problem! The decorations were the best part, I would say. There was a little kitschy sign about avocados and how they are only perfect for about one second; they're either too hard or rotten. Lots of neon signs that made the productive, calm atmosphere inviting and youthful. If I lived near one, I would definitely be there often."

Lots of people lounging inside, so it seemed promising. We ordered a latte and the Iron Man.The guys behind the counter seemed in disarray. They weren't very welcoming, but that could be because they were running around like chickens who lacked communication. We waited for our order behind a girl who had been waiting for food, and she waited, and it turns out that they given her order to someone else, so we awkwardly watched two employees argue about it. One angrily asking the other what happened to the sandwich he had placed there and the other unsure of anything.Once we received our orders, we briefly sat. I didn't enjoy my juice one bit. It was very frothy, and I wasn't into the graininess, which I understand happens when juice is not strained. As we sat, our name was called again, so my bf went to check why and turns out amongst the employees' confused work flow, they had made both our drinks twice. They tossed the duplicated drinks. Leaves me wondering how often they make mistakes having witnessed and experienced two during our very short stay here."

It was a pretty small space and had random strings of lights along the bar and the outside window. It was cute but very divey - I'm glad I got to visit but don't really know if I'd take a date here or even suggest this place to hang out with a friend if I could choose.They had Lagunitas (currently my favorite beer), for the pretty reasonable happy hour price of $4 in a bottle.

They check your temperature before you sit and all the staff wore masks- very safe!For food I got the chocolate chip pancakes with eggs and bacon, and a hot coffee. The pancakes were the perfect size and had plenty of chocolate chips, the whipped butter and syrup made it! 4.5/5 I enjoyed them. The eggs and bacon were cooked perfect, 5/5. The coffee was good, not too strong, 3/5 because I like more flavor.My friend got the black and white milkshake and the Greek omelette.

On Saturday's, they have a DJ for brunch and on Sunday's, they apparently have a Drag brunch, which I'd love to come back for. The outdoor seating area where we sat was cute with floral, bright colored decor. It isn't that heated, so I wouldn't come back unless the weather is super warm or I can get a seat inside. The staff were very friendly and the kitchen was accommodating with swaps!The food was delicious and perfect to go with our bottomless brunch, which is a great deal. My least favorite part of the meal would actually be the Burracho Pan Dulche, which is the French toast. It's honestly just regular French toast with Dulche de leche sauce, fruits, and powdered sugar. However, the bacon was thick and juicy. I tried my friend's dish, which was the Chilaquiles Rojos, and I wish I got that instead! It was super flavorful. The Adobo Fries was tasty and perfectly crunchy outside and soft inside. The chips and guacamole were good too, but I wish the guacamole was spicier. My favorite dishes were the chicken empanadas and the churros. Since it was my birthday, they gave me a sparkler, which I loved! Overall, Toro Loco is a great place to brunch with your girl friends and dance to the music. The food is not authentic Mexican, but more of a Mexican/American fusion, and it's a nice departure from regular brunch foods!"

They were also quick with bringing the drinks.For food, we got Nachos for the table and I got the Avo Toast Loco Style for my main. Nachos were delicious (can't really go wrong with them).

1441,0LjGdHn5paLedudi6DAxDA,10/31/2021,3 star rating,"3.5 Decent first time experience and a good pick for a Halloween weekend dinner. Staff were friendly, helpful and in full makeup for Dia de Muertos (Day of the dead). The weather looked iffy in terms of possible rain, but their outdoor seating arrangements  were more than accommodating-- just in case (full roof and side shield of plexiglass).Only thing is that we had to move away from the awful stench of garbage emanating from an alley way next door to the restaurant. It was awful.Once we got settled, we pulled up the menu from the QR code and as I browsed it, noticed there were many dishes that included red meat ingredients. I believe there was the option to eliminate it for some dishes, not all. We placed our drink order (white Sangria for me) and proceeded to choose a main.I decided upon the Shrimp taco and was encouraged to order it. There were three tacos to an order and from the description, I was sold. My one friend ordered Chicken Fajita while the other selected the Cheese Crust Steak Taco.When our meal arrived, my Shrimp taco platter was underwhelming and small. My friend's selections were hearty and filling.Needless to say,  since I was hungry, I was disappointed. These tacos were teeny. When the waitress returned, I ordered a side of Yuca fries. Overall with the fries, the meal became filling and there were some good flavors going on.We shared the Churros dessert which were bite size pieces accompanied by two sauces--nutella and butterscotch--it was really good.If I had to summarize my experience and meal in one word, I'd say it was satisfying/solid.I didn't walk away raving about any specific part of my meal but it was pretty good.The ambience was festive, service--attentive and food was good.

1443,nrwOQSXoRXfAYhkdjiUk8g,11/30/2019,3 star rating,"3.5/5Delicacy Passion Patisserie was formerly known as Audrey's Concerto and the aesthetic of the cafe and its desserts seems to mirror Audrey's. Unfortunately, I have to say that the quality of their desserts doesn't quite live up to its ""Patisserie"" title. Although all their cakes and tarts are beautifully made and fairly priced, I wonder if they taste as good as they look.Why throw so much shade, you may ask? I ordered a 8"" mango mousse cake from here for my sister's birthday and was very disappointed. Visually, the cake was beautifully decorated. However, it fell short with its taste. I was told by the chef that the center would have lychee jam and green tea so this was not a surprise upon cutting the cake. The surprise was the bitterness of the matcha in the green tea portion and the weak flavor of the mango mousse, which is supposed to be the highlight of the cake. The lychee jam was good, but it couldn't save the other weak flavors. I understand that Asian desserts are usually not as sweet as their American counterparts, but I think the flavors in this cake were far too mild to be satisfying as a dessert. $45 for a 8"" cake is quite pricey, and certainly not worth it for something so subpar."

When you bite into it, there is a raspberry jam filing, it's like a legit medium rare burger. Some of my favorites: Mango mousse with lychee and matcha jelly: You can taste all the mango in just one bite. Lemon tart: it has the right amount of sweetness and sourness. The staff members are super friendly since I wasn't leaving yet, they left my deserts in the fridge until I was ready to leave. I'll be back to try their crepe cakes."

My son and I come here when we want to put a smile on our face and they never disappoint. Their prices are more than reasonable, the staff is friendly, they are very clean and meticulous and their display case is small but I prefer it to really be able to see each dessert art piece they have.  I hope they are around for years to come. Highly recommend!"

I ordered a 6 inch baby shower rat cake for my sis, it's totally not worth it!  I cannot believe I paid almost $150 for this cake! I have to give the bakery only one star because it's not only pricy but also looking kind of cheap. The day we went to pick up the cake, cannot believe they would put it inside of the carton, i think it's because of the size of the custom cake(a bit taller), they cannot use their regular cake box, but really? Put it inside of the carton during this COVID time? It looks not only dirty and dusty, but also couldn't keep the cake stable (as you could see from the pic, it already slipped after we opened the box). Also the cream tasted horrible... We should have got a much better cake from other places.. please stay away, especially for special celebrations!"

After a terrible dining experience in Manhattan, my sister and I needed some nice desserts to cleanse our palate and treat our tummy.To start off, I have to say their presentation very much like Audrey's, amazing and cute. Their first row of desserts on display were all made into cute Christmas ornaments. We had a slice of their chocolate cake and berry mousse. They were both very good and not too sweet. I wished the chocolate cake was a tad richer in flavor but it was still yum yum yum. The berry mousse on the other hand felt a little sweeter in comparison but was a bit tangy, evening it out. I am so glad we were able to make it before closing to treat ourselves to something nice.Will I be revisiting more frequently? I think so!!"
1448,nrwOQSXoRXfAYhkdjiUk8g,10/18/2020,4 star rating,"Not your average bakery.  I'm not much of a sweets person, however the pastries here are good. They aren't overly sweet.  They have a small variety of pre-made items to choose from. A lot of options are customized, which is their specialty and sets them aside from other bakery's.  Other places make their pastries super sweet with too much fondant, at Delicacy it's not like that. You can enjoy a cute pastry, without the overpowering sugar taste.  I'll recommend if you want something out of the box, or a cute treat to give as a gift."

I was here during the Yelp Elite Event Monday... and I can honestly say that my socks were blown off. Everything was fresh and beautifully decorated. There were so many selections and the customer service was great out of everything I recommend their Lemon Tart. It was fresh lemony without begin overbearing. The crust was buttery and had a great crumble. The runner up was the tiramisu, although it really lacked the coffee flavor I enjoyed it was a nice play to the original. If you're looking for beautifully decorated treats to end a lovely meal please stop by"
1450,nrwOQSXoRXfAYhkdjiUk8g,2/14/2021,5 star rating,"I'm back again (But this time for Chinese New Year and Valentine's Day festivities)!I contacted the bakery through social media to place my order for two cakes this time around and they gave me a 10% discount on each cake for preordering. Per usual, the customer service was stellar and they were very helpful with answering my very numerous questions. Okay back to the cakes:1. Chinese New Year Cake: By far, one of the cutest cakes I've ever laid my eyes on. The miniature cow head (which btw, is a miniature lychee mousse dessert) just tied the whole cake's presentation together. I requested that the base of the cake was Pandan/Jackfruit and Coconut flavor and it was divine. The little mango chunks was a great compliment to the overall creaminess and richness from the Pandan and Coconut. My family loved the cake and they barely give compliments so easily (especially my parents)! Overall, the cake was super fluffy and not overly sweet and dry whatsoever. 9.5/102. Valentine's Day Cake:This cake was especially for my boyfriend. The little roses are actually made up of small red velvet cupcakes with buttercream frosting. I requested that the base of the cake to be Matcha and Red Bean flavored. Compared to the last time I had their Matcha and Red Bean cake, I definitely tasted more of the matcha this time around! I thought it was really sweet and thoughtful of them to add in decoration lights inside the box which I could control with a switcher click from the outside. :)  9/10This gem of a bakery definitely knows what they're doing and I'm so happy that they're doing fine during these COVID times!"

1452,nrwOQSXoRXfAYhkdjiUk8g,10/8/2019,5 star rating,"I got 1 slice of Strawberry Cream Cake slice and Strawberry Peach & Vanilla Strawberry Mille Crepe each to go. I am happily eating them right now so I can review in real time.The Strawberry Cream Cake slice is fruity perky with a very enjoyable balance of sweet and strawberry slightly tart the cream is generous leading to being fit for NYC as it transported well after being on the bus for 40 minutes and my subsequent walking. Its excellent mixing of strawberry through the cream is as advertised.The Strawberry Peach & Vanilla Strawberry Mille Crepe cake slice ($4.25) is a bit less perfect since it was rather soggy, maybe from all the transit, but lacked the crepe being pronounced as contrasting against the creme layers which won over all.Many think of the famous chain predecessors Tous Les Jours and Paris Baguette as they are all very similar and I would say inspiration for this store. I left a review for the elite event held here today at yelp.com/biz/elite-event… which purposely keeps it separate.There are so many more dishes I will come back to try especially as I am nearby frequently. Thank you for now to the owners and staff for bringing us this new concept in Asian bakeries!"

We got the vegetarian and meat platters, together it was a great variety of food, but there was overlap between the two (like the meat platter has 3 meat dishes and 3 veggie options that overlap w veggie platter). Super filling for two people and flavorful. Rating 3 stars because they did some funny biz in charging our credit cards. We split the bill with two cards and they ended up over charging us $8 more per person, came over to tell us they'd void it but in a weird tone. Just super weird that they'd make the same mistake twice."

Small at first glance, you walk inside and the place is much bigger than it seems (more seating around the back.Between two people, shared the Avocado appetizer ($8), Vegetarian Combo ($17), and a couple glasses of Ethiopian wine ($7 each). The avocado is served inside injera bread with tomatoes, peppers and onions. A fine starter that's large enough to share. The combo is a slightly rolled injera bread with eight dollops of different veggie concoctions. Lentils are cooked well, lots of flavor in each dish, and even some tangy collard greens for some differentiation in texture. Was hoping for a bit spicier meal, yet the flavor is there. Wine is your standard fare - strong but not overwhelming the food. To finish, shared the strawberry cake slice ($3ish); a bit odd tasting - not as sweet as it should be.A couple of ladies were working the fairly busy spot. Despite that, we got our food pretty quickly. I would say the place is 3.5 stars, rounded up for solid atmosphere and friendly service."

Both orders were served on one platter and it was obvious the items supposed to be part of both samplers were not doubled to a two-person serving. Two tablespoons maybe of 12 items total, including a very dry beef and collard greens dish. That's $35 for one pale plate. Then we got an ""African Chocolate Cake"" thinking it might cheer us up. Smallest sliver of Costco cake I've ever had (attached), and priced at $3.90 to add insult to injury. Service was also slow, we seated ourselves and waited a few minutes for anyone who worked there to even appear after we gathered our own menus from the front.

This was served on the Injera bread with another whole Injera to eat it all with. This was a lot of food for one person - but for me a perfect portion - I would have been hungry if it was less, but then I eat pretty big meals for a vegetarian.Unfortunately delivery by eat24/GrubHub took a little longer than it should have, and so by the time the food arrived it was barely warm.

A few of the places that came in my search had a 'B' health score and a few others were marked not good for kids, so I ended up deciding to have dinner at Meske. Well, most of the restaurants in Mid Manhattan get so crowded during dinner time. So I called them up in advance and made a reservation. And we walked up to totally empty restaurants where we were the only party dining in throughout our entire dinner span. We got a vegetarian combo, nonvegetarian combo, a plate of samosa and a couple of wine to drink (they were out of cocktails). Though it took almost 20 minutes for the food to arrive, I felt like they just reheated some already prepared food. The combos tasted ok and samosa tasted very bland. The drinks were ok."

Started with the Harar which was  a fine pilsner.I never would think Ethiopia had a culinary side to it's county. All I remember is talk about the famine hitting the county hard. This has been the second time eating this fare and I absolutely love it and goes on top of Indian and Italian.The Veggie Combination includes eight different items. Miser alech (mild), miser wat, shro wat, vegetable #2, vegetable #1 and collard greens. I honestly do not know what they were but everyone had it's on distinct flavor. Some was sweet, some was smokey, some was spicy and some was garlicky. The bread is a useful tool and I am new to no silverware but it helps you to sop up all the goodies...you rip, make kinda a cup and scoop...Yummy!They also have meat but didn't try...It's worth a try but you better have clean hands..."
1487,kSX8M82uUAcw5vfhn8jMng,8/19/2022,5 star rating,"The Black Label burger here is one of my favourites in the city for sure. It's worth the extra few dollars. The burger is a must order every time, but if you're looking to have some variety, we've also enjoyed the Moules Frites, though I'm sure nothing on the menu will lead you astray. When we go, we both order burgers. They come default with fries, so we also have upgraded one portion to pommes anna, these beautifully crispy and buttery layered potatoes. I'd also recommend these if you're willing to pay a bit of an extra fee for them. The soufflé is the perfect way to end the meal as well. There was chocolate and Grand Marnier flavours to choose from, and we went with the Grand Marnier per our server's recommendation. It was divine and totally worth the extra wait. I would highly recommend stopping by! Everything I've tried here has been excellent."

After searching for breakfast, ended up doing breakfast and lunch here. We tried the croque madame, the belgian waffle, and the classic cheeseburger. Everything was very good - great service, fun old school vibe, and yes, the burger lived up to the hype. Definitely worth a visit whilst a New York resident..."
1489,kSX8M82uUAcw5vfhn8jMng,1/7/2023,5 star rating,"First visit to Minetta Tavern today for a 2 o'clock late lunch res. Very tough to get into this spot, the res was made well in advance but was absolutely worth the trouble. The inside vibe is awesome, real old school New York kinda feel. We sat in a corner booth and had an incredible experience. Our server/service in general was fantastic so hats off to both the front and BOH. We were seated immediately and put in our order swiftly. The French onion soup along with a baguette of Balthazar baked bread came out very soon after ordering. Both really delicious. The main event came with, of course, our burgers. I had the Black Label burger and my girlfriend had the Minetta burger. Both absolutely lived up to the hype behind them but we both agreed the Black Label burger held the slight edge due to the tenderness of the dry aged burger blend they use. The Black Label burger is unlike any burger I've ever had and for that, I have no problem paying $38 for it. It's one of, if not, the best burgers I've ever had. I love the simplicity and focus on the meat itself. I think some burgers can go a little crazy with the toppings putting a fried egg, bacon etc. on top. Dry aged burger blend and caramelized onions on a Balthazar seeded brioche bun is all it takes. Simplicity with a emphasis on the few ingredients themselves wins every time. It doesn't come with cheese which I'd maybe add for next time, but I wanted to have it for the first time the way the chef prepares it. 10/10 would recommend, everyone needs to try this burger!"

The food is always 10/10 and the buzz of this place is unparalleled. Everything from the bar to the ambiance and decor really transports you in time and sets the mood right to dine like royalty. I love the classic old school vibe of this place and keep coming back here year after year. We started off with the bread which was fresh and warm and rustic style. Butter and flaky salt is a stroke of genius, I have never seen that combo at a restaurant before and it really elevates the bread when you sprinkle that tiny speck of salt on it. For appetizers we had the escargot which were made beautifully, little morsels of what seemed like a risotto with escargot dotting the plate. Presentation was beautiful and the dish tasted amazing. I had the sirloin special with peppercorn sauce - absolutely to die for! My friend had the minetta burger - also scrumptious. Nearly everything here comes with fries and Minetta fries are absolutely amazing. Thin and crispy without being too hard. They need no condiment. We always get a side of their sautéed spinach. It is always perfectly prepared with garlic and comes in a skillet. The best side if you're having the steak. Another favorite of ours here is the coconut cake - an absolutely legendary slice of cake. Highly recommended."

I'd heard about their burger for a long time and decided to pop in one night.Got lucky and copped a seat at the bar, had a dirty martini in hand within minutes which was expertly mixed and very alcohol forward. Burger came medium rare with a massive heap of fries, melted cheese and caramelized onion on top. Simple but cooked to perfection. It isn't the most innovative but definitely worth trying at least once.The restaurant is not big and gets quite crowded, so the atmosphere can be quite loud and rowdy especially on the weekends. Servers are friendly and fun. Prices are definitely on the higher end, cocktails are $21 and the burger will set you back around $30."
1492,kSX8M82uUAcw5vfhn8jMng,11/14/2022,4 star rating,"A NY institution. Came here on my search of the best burger in NYC. Service was amazing. Got the Minetta burger. Even though it wasn't the black label, the quality of beef was pretty extraordinary. Everything else on the plate was perfectly fine but less extraordinary. Sesame seed bun, single piece of lettuce, tomato, pickle, caramelized onions, and a mountain of fries. The fries are your ubiquitous thin-cut crispy salty fries that are ubiquitous at all places that serve burgers now-a-days.The patty was really the standout, which almost made me want to just eat it on its own like a steak. The bun and veggies that came with it seemed almost like a distraction. An ideal burger for me is greater the sum of its parts, whereas this was purely about the beef. It was pretty damn good beef though."

Walked in on a Saturday night prime time and was able to be seated at the bar for dinner within ~10 minutes. Big Apple - 3/5 - Well made and has rye & scotch, decent amount. I think this was just personal preference but I didn't really like the apple syrup. Côtes-du-rhône Bois de Brignon (2019) - 5/5 - Would recommend! Bartender chose this to pair with the burger and I think he hit it on the nose. Great acidity profile. Roasted Bone Marrow - 5/5 - Enough for 4 people or more, but we managed to scrape off every bite between just us two. Bone marrow so soft, savory, with bread buttered to perfection and the cherry on top which is their shallot confit. It was very reminiscent of Au Cheval's bone marrow, and the patrons next to us mentioned that it's the same owner but I couldn't find anything online to confirm this.Steak Frites - 5/5 - Solid steak. The béarnaise sauce was better than your average. But the real star here is their FRIES! Quite possibly the best I've ever had. They were so addicting yet plentiful that I couldn't even finish. Black Label Burger - 5/5 - I've never quite had a burger like this before. The quality of the meat truly shines. I can't even put my finger on how many different notes of meats you encounter with every bite. You don't even notice the bread (made intentionally just for Minetta by Balthazar) or the caramelized onions because the meat really, truly shines here and they compliment it well.Chocolate Soufflé - 3.5/5 - Already stuffed at this point but I couldn't pass up soufflé. Although I will say this one was too moist for my liking. Maybe would have tasted better if I added ice cream on the side. Espresso martini - 5/5 - Worth mentioning that they make a pretty good espresso martini. Strong coffee flavor shines through.Shoutout to our calm & collected, knowledgeable bartender Stefano. Would visit again and to try different things like the gem lettuce salad and bone-in NY steak!"

The Black Label Burger was soooo delicious. The Roasted Bone Marrow - the portion size! Definitely enough for a group of four. Do yourself a favor and order the Soufflé for Two when you place in the rest of your order to time dessert perfectly. We got the chocolate one and it made me fool myself into thinking I want to spend time learning how to make it. For cocktails, I got the Murray Sour (not pictured) and the Rhubarb Sophie (2nd cocktail picture). We ate outside early Thursday evening of this week, and the team was so nice with helping us stabilize our table and turning on the outdoor fan. And they were so helpful with cocktail recs!"

We had a 5PM dinner reservation, which is when they open so if you have the same time, just a heads up that they did not open the doors until 5PM. Some other reviews said they opened a few minutes before so I think it varies but since the weather is a bit colder now, I would bundle up just in case you decide to go earlier. The service was honestly over the top incredible. Our waitress was so nice and offered so many recommendations that we followed her on. They also brought us complimentary champagne at the start of our meal since we were celebrating our anniversary which was such a nice surprise! We decided to split everything so ordered the below:Lobster Bisque - part of the daily special, it was very yummy especially after being in the cold!Truffle Mac and Cheese - part of the daily special, honestly this was so good, I wish I ordered one to take home haha it might have been my favorite thing but I'm a sucker for truffleBone Marrow - I meannnnnnnn OBVIOUSLY this was delicious AF. Our waitress recommended this come out with our burger and to put some on our burger which we did and it was incredibleBlack Label Burger - cooked to perfection and an absolutely delicious burger. The fries also were incredible which I don't know why, I didn't expect but they were just as amazing as the burger. We cleared the whole plate and left nothing behind.Chocolate Soufflé a la mode - okay I have no idea how I missed this but the soufflé is BIG LOL. In the photo's I'm not sure why I thought it would be smaller but when it arrived at our table I literally said 'holy f*** that's big"" and the waiter laughed haha just letting everyone know here in case you are like me. That being said it was extremely delicious and we demolished the entire thing.We loved everything about our experience there from the food to the ambiance and the service.

1501,PYcL2z9gHj6-ZTlViT9Nqw,9/5/2022,4 star rating,I've been ordering from here a lot lately. The pizza is pretty good but my only complaint is that they're pretty stingy with the toppings.

The pizza however was not great.  One of my biggest pet peeves is when the pizza crust isn't sturdy enough to hold the weight of the toppings -- you know, when you lift up a slice and it goes totally limp, and all the cheese and toppings slide right off? Well, that was my tartufo pizza. The crust looked underdone. Plus, it was supposed to have truffle oil somewhere on it, but i'll be damned if I tasted any.  Also, if you go during the winter months insist for a table as far away from the front door as possible -- they have no draping to block the cold from invading the dining room and have a very heavy door that doesnt close on its own. We spent half our meal getting up to pull the door shut. Brrrr."

Nice and crispy. Hot chocolate was served nicely with plenty of whipped cream and chocolate sauce.Now onto the real review. This experience was extremely disappointing. I ordered the Cypriot panini with Cypriot country ham, halloumi cheese, and tomatoes. The sandwich was warm and appeared grilled on the outside, but it looked like the halloumi cheese was haphazardly slapped on instead of nicely grilled. I removed it from the sand which because of how unappetizing it appeared. The rest of the sandwich was just dry grilled bread, ham, and tomato. No condiments, nothing. I ate about half of it because I was hungry. A panini is supposed to be hot all the way through, melty, and delicious. This sandwich was emphatically NOT any of those things.The other dish we ordered was the Prima Donna Crepe with Nutella, whipped cream, and vanilla ice cream. I may be wrong, but I tried some and the filling did not taste like real Nutella to me, and I know Nutella. The only good things on that plate were the whipped cream and ice cream.Unfortunately, I will not be returning."

They put all their money into fancy decor and simulating a lavish atmosphere and don't consider customer service/experience.Tonight I ordered a shrimp salad, it took 2 hours, 15 minutes to arrive, and it was dry as a bone. I really believe they should consider ramping up their wait times, because the food is good whenever I go; which is why I am not giving a one star review."

In other words, not good.Stuff either sits here behind the glass case for way too long and is never fresh, or I've just happened to pick the one old item 5-10x in a row. Going to go with option A. Maybe getting freshly made to order desserts would result in a better experience? I don't really know.Having also had the regular food here, I can't say it was worth it either. Everything we ordered tasted like it came from a pre-packaged frozen supermarket box and then microwaved.Service was also incredibly slow which really ruined the first experience here."

From the moment we walked in, it was spectacular.We went here on Friday 9th September for 9pm reservations. My bestie had secured a spot to celebrate my birthday the next day. We got seated right away and the music was priming us for what was ahead. First the food: we had oysters, the grilled octopus, charred Brussel sprouts, the crudo sampler and chicken. The oysters weren't the best I've had, they were pretty small but good. The star of the night was the grilled octopus. Do yourself a favor and order this you will not be disappointed, I promise! Although, the crudo came at a close second contender. Beautifully flavored it just melted in my mouth. Can't say anything about the cocktails because I did Prosecco the whole night. Service: our waitress never once smiled the whole night, she was efficient but seemed overwhelmed. If you're having someone work a Friday night crowd, they need to match the energy so that wasn't there unfortunately. My BF had an amazing server the previous visit and she happens to be working the table next to us - now her energy was everything. We will ask for her next time. The ambiance: I mean what can I say, this is what Kyma is known for! Halfway through our experience it started. The table (or chair rather) dancing. Every time a bottle or shots are ordered, they bring out the sparklers. It was fun watching everyone get LIT, they were up and dancing and waving their white napkins in the air.

He said that they have the best vodka slice. He's pretty right. We ordered a vodka pie to go one night, and while it's a pretty creamy and heavy slice loaded with cheese, it totally hits the spot. We decided to try to sit in on a Saturday night, they were super busy and we didn't want to wait so we decided to order takeout instead. We got spaghetti and meatballs, mild buffalo wings, and a rice all special. More than enough food for two people! Their portion s are big and pretty worth the price. The spaghetti was cooked al dente and comes with two large meatballs. The rice ball special is the rice ball split open, their rice ball doesn't have any meat filling like some other pizzerias. They bake it with loads of ricotta, mozzarella and marinara. Super filling! Their buffalo wing sauce had a slight taste of sweet bbq to it, which I enjoyed, not the usually orangey buffalo wings I'm used to though, maybe their hot ones are a bit different. I enjoyed these none the less, pretty juicy and not soggy. A pretty solid place in the neighborhood if you want good pizza and some solid pasta. portions are big! If you want takeout I would call in advance and pick up because they do get busy with takeout orders, delivery, and people eating in."

I'm not sure if it was because I'm not Italian or if she was just having a bad day but it doesn't hurt to say you're welcome. Not going back here. The food wasn't any special either for the price."

They have casual dinner options like pizza and calzones as well as fancier meat and pasta dishes. Last night we ordered delivery and the food arrived within 45 minutes (this is the usual time it takes, it's worth it for the quality). I ordered the Cappellini in pink sauce with sun-dried tomatoes and capers. The flavor of this sauce is seriously one of my favorites, very similar to vodka but less tangy and a bit sweeter. I recommend this place to anyone who wants a delicious Italian dinner."

That might be the most ridiculous thing on the planet . However I did enjoy the food 50% of the time , so I would walk out of my way to go get the food as take out most of the time . Yet today I didn't want to get out , so I ordered "" non contact delivery"" due to Covid-19 . Nearly one hour later I called casa Bella , the guy immediately asked "" what's your address ?? The delivery guy said there were no houses . Your address must be wrong ."" That literally pissed me off so much especially this is the forth time they did this to me .  Just because your delivery guy can't read the map within 5 mins walking distance doesn't mean I don't know how to type my address .  Finally when I saw the delivery guy , if he said sorry for the wait and inconvenience , I would not complain about anything . Instead, he said"" oh you didn't pick up my call . I didn't want to leave the food outside . This is a four story apartment  building . So many people . You know !"" That angered me to the next level . I live in a HOUSE! Two stories high . The store called me stated he could not find my house . And yet he was lying to my face saying he didn't just want to put the food outside . Mind you this was meant to be a "" non contact "" delivery .  As a middle aged man , he could not own up to his mistake that he could not read the house number , nor could he read the map . He chose to lie to his supposedly non contact customer . Nice !  All I got was room temperature pizza . The hot food was warm enough , not going to lie .I wish I didn't pay the food , delivery and tips  with my card up front . That guy didn't deserve a 18% tip. And of course , I would never order delivery from casa Bella ever again ."

Beneath the circus tent-esque awning, a small shrubbery of houseplants occupies the window. Inside, harsh fluorescent lamps light the whitewashed walls, viridian shiplap trim, and dirty brick-red tiled floors. Plaques of Absolute Bagels' accolades and bagel-related photos line the walls. The queue loops to the far back of the space, where the many bagel varieties are separated into heaps. Directly to the right is a coolly-lit display of spreads and toppings, and the cafeteria-style red-and-yellow font menu is pressed above the counter. Teeny bopper pop mixes with the aroma of baked bread to fill the air.My partner and I arrived early on a weekend, and there was only a slow trickle of customers. We opted for an iced coffee and 2 toasted Everything Bagels -- one with Lox Spread, the other with Strawberry Cream Cheese (unfortunately, Absolute was out of the Blueberry). After paying (cash only!), we waited briefly before being handed a nondescript brown paper bag.The bagels were immediately notable for their large size, a blistered and crisp exterior with a generous coating of salt and other everything seasonings, and the chewy, flavorful interior. Our heavy dollop of lox spread, salty and packing a punch of flavor, was as enjoyable as full lox slices for just a fraction of the price. In comparison, the strawberry cream cheese was disappointing, sporting some strawberry slices but tasting wholly unremarkable, and further exacerbated by Absolute forgetting to toast this bagel. Finally, the iced coffee tasted somewhat watered down, and undissolved sugar crystals crunched throughout it.Despite the hiccups during this visit, I was impressed enough with my toasted bagel and lox spread that I had to visit again for round 2. This time, I arrived on a Friday morning to a more substantial line going out the door. I braved it and had a brown bag in-hand within 20 minutes, and, fortunately, the quality was just as exceptional as my original experience. $6 for a bagel with spread does not immediately scream bargain. But Absolute Bagels' churns out a killer bagel and a decadent lox cream cheese, rivaling $15 smoked salmon sandwiches I've had in the city. I would emphatically recommend that any bagel lover go out of their way specifically for this item."
1564,YKsHo3V-PkeRQdLYOdG7ZA,12/12/2022,5 star rating,"Never tried the bagels NOT toasted but get them toasted if you can. It's an extra 10 cents. I've tried Tompkins, Pick a Bagel chain, and Russ & Daughters and think absolute is the best. It's not overly chewy that would make your jaws hurt. It's not sour. Not too salty nor too sweet. Perfect. (Haven't tried bagels outside of Manhattan and stuck with Absolute because why go elsewhere)Their fillings are alright. Pretty standard and their lox is expensive. Someone mentioned getting lox spread as a cheaper way and I agree with this suggestion. However, expect maybe a pinch size of real lox in the cream cheese (you can also get lox tofutti) Buttered bagel is also just okay... butter didn't really have flavor. So just get the bagels! Or bagels with some cream cheese (they give a lot!!) Service is average. You can get someone nice or someone with an attitude. Cash only with no atm."

I especially recommend the tofutti for the lactose-intolerant. While the bagel and spreads are not worth waiting in a long line for 20+ min, if you find a time that avoids those usual weekend lines, give absolute bagels a try. I did, and I'll certainly be back!MY ORDERx1 Everything Bagel with Lox Spreadx1 Sesame Bagel with Chives and Garlic Tofutti EVERYTHING BAGEL WITH LOX SPREAD: ($6.30) The everything bagel was a delicious, toasted bagel that was slightly hard on the outside, bouncy on the inside and toasted just right. The off-orange cream cheese flavored with lox was pretty tasty and generously applied (there was enough to eat with half of another bagel). SESAME BAGEL WITH CHIVES AND GARLIC TOFUTTI: ($5.30) The sesame bagel was equally as good as the everything bagel. What was really the focus of this bagel was the tofutti! A dairy free alternative to cream cheese, the chives and garlic tofutti was surprisingly delicious! While not as dense as cream cheese, the tofutti had the same level of creaminess you'd expect from a good bagel spread. It also tasted great with just a hint of soy and an aromatic punch of chives and garlic. ENVIRONMENT: small hole-in-the-wall with a small waiting area. You'll be getting your bagel to-go.TIPS:- they serve a breakfast bagels special from 6a.m. - 11:00a.m.- while there was a long line when I visited on a Friday, I believe that is an aberration and regular weekdays don't have a long line- cash onlyCONS:- if the lines are long, I don't think its worth the wait even though the bagels and spread are both equally good"

This is a good ice cream place that has Asian influences in a lot of their flavors.  I tried a few (with the matcha in particular being a good not so super sweet variant with a lot of flavor) and I eventually went with the Orchard Road.The Orchard Road is listed as: ""Pandan with coconut purple yam swirl"" with the purple yam being ube presumably. It's essentially a mix of everything good from South East Asia. The pandan flavor is well pronounced and the swirl added a lot of flavor as well. The size of the scoop was large and the price was worth it for the unique flavors. Good place. Nice staff also."
1570,JV5oa5-KGdiWnqrKPoxSug,4/23/2020,4 star rating,"Kaylee's is a utopia for sweet toothed folks who love their ice cream in flavors beyond the basic mint chocolate chip or rocky road. Though I would argue that when we are spoiled for choice in New York it is disappointing when an ice cream parlour doesn't even attempt to push the envelope with flavors even just a little bit. So with flavors like pandan coconut purple yam swirl and earl gray sriracha chili spice, Kaylee's met the criteria I set for an ice cream shop I'd patronize emphatically.Kaylee's has improved on their formula quite a bit from their nascent days. I remember finding the consistency a bit too stiff for my liking, but recent visits over the past year have always been a delight. They've now mastered the right level of creaminess and airiness I want in a scoop.During every visit I can't help but try one of their seasonal specials which have really knocked my socks off, but I find myself going back to their classic flavors again and again. Coffee Cake's pieces of cinnamon coffee cake streusel is a particular favorite, as is the delicious Cookies and Cream. I like when ice cream has good texture in it, and the pieces of graham cracker, cake, or cookie that they have in most of their ice cream really takes it up a notch for me.Can always count on a little Kaylee's for an afternoon pick me up when the workday is a drag."

There is a long line, so keep in mind when visiting but moves at a reasonable pace. I think I waited 20-25 mins to get my coffee. Also looks like they have plenty of seating available inside though we did not stay but were told it was only going to be an extra 15 min wait. We came on a Sunday around 3 by the way. It's right by Central Park, so great place to grab a coffee on a nice day and stroll in the park. Sure, there are probably better, cheaper coffee available but still a good experience nevertheless. The shop is also attached to their store, so you also drink you coffee while you shop there. The only disappointment thing is they ran out of chocolate chip cookies right in front of me and I really wanted to try one, but I guess it makes sense since it was later in the day."

My espresso tasted so acidic - so ignore that and go for the more beverage-y type coffee drinks, or iced coffee. The morning bun was a cinnamon twisted bun. It was tasty and fresh but good luck handling the cinnamon sugar fallout gracefully hahahaDon't get fooled when you see there's no seats outside - just enter and there's plenty seats. It was muggy that day and the indoor was definitely better :)"
1579,RGK1ASygW8Q4JeJJ-Az9Xw,3/9/2023,1 star rating,I came in at 8:45 am and asked if i could sit down because i had 30 mins before an appointment. I ordered my average coffee and pastry which can me quickly and  service was prompt. I asked to pay right away because I knew I was on a deadline and the tip options were 20/25/30%. I gladly tipped 20%. At 9:00 am the server came over to me and the table next to me and even though my coffee was half drank she asked if we could hurry up because there was a wait. There are signs to cap your stay at 45 minutes. I said i'm not leaving till i'm done and it's been 15 mins and she said okay - it was just a request.  I understand they want to rush people for more sales - but then please have signs saying max 15 minutes so i know to go somewhere else.

I ordered a vanilla latte and a chocolate croissant - the only reason why I gave it a 4 stars and not 5 was because the croissant was not very warm when I received it so the chocolate in it was chunky. Other than that, the aesthetics in here are so pleasing to the eye and the coffee is amazing! Definitely will come back when visiting NYC again."
1581,RGK1ASygW8Q4JeJJ-Az9Xw,6/4/2022,4 star rating,"Ordered:Iced Mocha (~$6) with Unsweetened Almond Milk (+$1)Aya's take:Did you know Ralph Lauren has a cafe!? Spent the day on the Upper East Side and stopped by for a quick caffeine break. The Iced Mocha is their most expensive drink on the menu but it is so worth it! Creamy, smooth, and a great blend of chocolate and espresso. Grab a drink, pastry, and shop around!"
1582,RGK1ASygW8Q4JeJJ-Az9Xw,5/15/2022,4 star rating,"This coffee shop is located at Ralph Laurent store, inside is nicely decorated very elegant, Match the store design. The staffs are super friendly. The line to the coffee might be long but they move fast. The price is very affordable it's fancy place but not overpriced. I got the cappuccino to go, I didn't wait long for the coffee, even with the to go cup they made a little foam art too. The croissant is not flaky tho, which is a bit disappointing, doesn't taste fresh made.I like to sit at the outdoor seats. If you want to use the bathroom is located through the hotel lobby and take the elevator to lower lobby, one of the elevator didn't work so some of us got stuck on the lower floor because there's no stairs to come up, the janitor was nice to take us through employee elevator through storage room to come out. If she was not there we didn't even know how to get out."

The greens were black after being frozen, and the sandwich was still very cold, and looked not fresh.So if I decide to come back here I will come only for drinks."

The pastries are cold and seem mass produced for local super market, coffee drinks nothing special. There are many other local options 1-2 blocks away."

It is truly so lovely and elegant inside, which is definitely what you are paying for. I ordered a chai latte to go with oat milk, which came out to $6.80. The drink took a little long to come out, but was warm and delicious on a rainy day. I will definitely be back to try the coffee and pastries dine-in!"

I've been going to the same few places in my neighborhood and I'm so glad to add this one to my list. Decently priced and the food is packed with flavor. Their garlic dip is to die for!
1588,qGvo8VHrY85b4Ze-JaIjYg,5/12/2022,5 star rating,Best restaurant in Brooklyn. They have the best food. Everything is always fresh. Highly recommend their full chicken with garlic sauce and tabbouli... exquisite
1589,qGvo8VHrY85b4Ze-JaIjYg,2/21/2022,3 star rating,"I work close by to this location. So I tried it a couple times. Most of my friends who are not middle eastern thinks this place is amazing and has the best shawarma. I tried both their chicken shawarma and the meat shawarma. I would probably give this place a 2.5 stars given that I have had amazing shawarma in the Middle East. The meat itself is really no bueno and dry. The flavor is mostly coming from the pickles and the sauce. Good shawarma should be able to have amazing flavor on its own without having to add anything to it. There are a couple good shawarma spots in NYC (one in bay ridge and one in Astoria). If you want the absolute best shawarma in the US, you need to go to Michigan though.. you can DM me and I will give you those recs if you ask nicely :p"
1590,qGvo8VHrY85b4Ze-JaIjYg,6/12/2022,3 star rating,"I've been eating here for over 20 years. Was always my favorite shawarma spot. However in the last year there's been a serious decline. I have the same order Every time I go, yet the last few visits have been a mess.  My orders are always mixed up or missing something. My last visit I Ordered two meat and one chicken, got all chicken. I've been a loyal customer for years and for the price of the food, you can't mix up orders several times and expect customers to continue to come back. Extremely Disappointed"

I finally went with him and it hit the spot.It has a cute little seating area very nicely decorated with Lebanese art. I got the mix shawarma platter and he got the mix gyro.Both really good.The service is great. Everyone working there is very friendly.Now it's not a fancy place, food is served on paper plates and plastic utensils. Good place to go with family."

1594,qGvo8VHrY85b4Ze-JaIjYg,3/5/2022,4 star rating,"Pretty good chicken shawarma! Really garlicky sauce, nice seating, juicy chicken, and decent prices. It was $11 each. They sell baklava for $6 and I was tempted to get some, but will save for next time!"
1595,qGvo8VHrY85b4Ze-JaIjYg,5/23/2020,4 star rating,"I've been a long time fan of Karam. They are my go to for a chicken shawarma sandwich. Their tahini or garlic sauce (not sure which sauce is in the sandwich) has a very strong flavor, the taste will linger in your mouth for a while, so be prepared for that. The large chicken shawarma plate which comes with two cold appetizers whereas the small is just the chicken with rice or salad is very filling. They are very generous with their portions. We ordered for pick up recently, they called when they had a question about the order and it was ready for pick up in time. I love their babaghanoush, I would probably choose this over their hummus (which is also good). Definitely a decent amount of food you get for the price. Their kibbeh balls are very flavorful. Their falafels are a good size but I do find them on the drier side. Definitely a good spot in the neighborhood, they never disappoint."
1596,qGvo8VHrY85b4Ze-JaIjYg,7/24/2019,5 star rating,"I can't believe I haven't been here sooner! I always pass by this restaurant when I'm in the area. This is a quick eat restaurant with about 6 dine in tables. Once you enter the restaurant, you place your order with the cashier and have a seat. They'll call you when your order is ready and you pick it up at the cashier. I had dinner with some friends here and we were completely satisfied with our meal. I had the shish taouk (chicken kebab) combination plate and it was VERY filling and delicious. It came with rice (you can also opt for a house salad), garlic sauce, pickled veggies and 2 thin pitas. The chicken was very tender, moist and flavorful. The garlic sauce is a MUST try. It was definitely the star of the dish and I would definitely come back just for the sauce. The staff were friendly and helpful and I can't wait to come back to dine here! Relatively cheap and really good compared to most restaurants in the area."
1597,DWR54ugpSThnDub4xeHWow,9/29/2022,1 star rating,"Corporate offices should really look into this franchise fiasco. I have eaten at a number of Paneras, and this is by far, hands down the worst. When I entered the mostly empty restaurant at 5:00pm on Wednesday, September 29, there was a group of employees (including the so-called manager!) gabbing around the register. When I finally caught the attention of one of them, I was just about to give my order, and he turned back to continue the conversation. When I sternly scowled, ""Is anyone working here?,"" they finally took my order. I waited for about 15 minutes (and there was just one name listed above mine in the order queue), and I saw my salad just sitting on the counter waiting to be bagged. I finally asked one of the so-called workers to retrieve it. Of course (and I was not one bit surprised), I got back to my office and noticed they got my order wrong. Come on, $15 for a salad and I have to put up with such misery. Never again. Go to the ETC across the street if you want a decent meal."
1598,DWR54ugpSThnDub4xeHWow,1/20/2020,4 star rating,"The service at this Panera is on par! I needed to grab a quick meal and to catch my train back before the snow started piling up. I ordered on the app and got to the location within ten mins. My order was already on the shelf ready for pick up, was neatly packed, and had all the correct specifications (utensils, dressing on the side, etc.). This location knows how to get customers in and out and is definitely one of the cleaner Panera's. It doesn't hurt that the employees greet you on the way in and out either."
1599,DWR54ugpSThnDub4xeHWow,3/22/2018,5 star rating,"I know Panera Bread is a chain but I really love it. I think they make really great sandwiches, pastries, soups, and breakfast options. This time around Adam and I went in the morning so we got two pastries and two breakfast sandwiches. Bacon, egg, and cheese on brioche and on regular white bread. They taste really good for how cheap they are. This location is two floors, the seating is downstairs. There was no one there at 9am on a Sunday so service was fast. It's close to the Empire State Building so if you like Panera Bread and are doing that activity, now you know :)"
1600,DWR54ugpSThnDub4xeHWow,8/4/2018,4 star rating,Got a reward for a free salad! Perfect way to start the week with a heart healthy meal.Store is conveniently located near Empire State Building and Korea Town. I got there right before 12pm to beat the lunch crowd. Line was short and I simply keyed in my phone number at the cashier which showed that I had the reward. Picked up my order in less than 10 mins.Strawberry poppyseed with chicken was great! Very  refreshing. PS: You can simply order on the app and pick up at the designated area in the back.
1601,DWR54ugpSThnDub4xeHWow,4/12/2022,5 star rating,"I order ahead my coffee through the Panera app. This store had my cup waiting for me. Now, you may think that's so simple, so what's the big deal. Well, the Panera north of this location on 5th Ave and 40th St consistently cannot place a coffee cup on the shelf with pre-orders. So, something so simple does get five stars from me."
1602,DWR54ugpSThnDub4xeHWow,2/13/2018,4 star rating,"I have never been to panera bread so I decided to give it a try. All my friends live this establishment and have been asking me to go.I encountered this location after sight seeing with a friend around times square/empire state building. They had spacious seating downstairs with a very relaxing atmosphere.I ordered the grain chicken salad and the chipotle avocado chicken melt. The food was very fresh tasting which is good, but lacked the wow factor. Since its my first time I can't judge entirely, so I guess I'll try something different next time(hear they're soups are really good).Overall a good relax time to enjoy my meal, good prices for the quality of food you are receiving. I will come back and follow up with an additional review."

1604,DWR54ugpSThnDub4xeHWow,9/19/2016,2 star rating,"This is the largest, most beautiful, cleanest Panera I've ever visited. And also the worst.We ordered a you-pick-two with a grilled cheese and Mac and cheese, and a French onion soup in a bread bowl. I ordered at a kiosk, which I prefer to ordering from a person, and I also think Panera's kiosk system is very usable. I ordered French baguettes with both of ours, and didn't specify for here or to go. It came to go, which was a little irritating because we had to drag our food out of bags and containers and assemble it ourselves. It created a ton of paper and plastic waste.They were out of baguettes apparently, as there were none in our bag, so they decided the only logical alternative was to give us no sides at all. It was only after we asked that they threw us a bag of chips and a piece of focaccia as a consolation prize (?). It was strange and I honestly don't know if I would have eaten here if I knew they were out. My bread bowl was cut poorly (I.e. Not at all) and my boyfriends grilled cheese was melded to the container. It would be a 1 star rated if it weren't for how huge and lovely the actual physical restaurant was."
1605,DWR54ugpSThnDub4xeHWow,7/30/2018,3 star rating,"Today I had the opportunity to do business in another Panera location. This location is very different than others I've been to visit. It appears at first to be take out only. When I asked I was told seating is downstairs. The three stars are for cleanliness and friendly fast customer service. My daughter had a free beverage for her birthday. The choice was soda, coffee or tea. They do not have a soda fountain at this location so her first choice was out. She opted for ice coffee. Their ice coffee is weak in her opinion so she has learned not to add too much cream. For free we made this stop. We aren't going to complain! Employees are smiling and friendly. The shift manager helped. The operation was smooth. I didn't go downstairs to the dining area. I saw the employees going up and down. I assume they bring your food down. This location is too far from home for me to be a steady customer. I will consider returning if I'm shopping in the neighborhood. I know and enjoy some of the Panera menu items. It's clean, friendly employees, and plenty of fresh baked goods. To be continued......"

The waitress was adorable and very helpful, and the food was exquisite. The portions were just enough as well - we were able to share some appetizers, finish our mains, and share a dessert... all accompanied by a creamy Thai iced tea. And the prices are very reasonable!Do not be deceived by the size of this place... it's a hole in the wall, but it is well worth the stop!PS - Be aware, the spiciness of the papaya salad is THAI spicy, not American! I would recommend mild, at the maximum...!!"
1608,0B3WbaM1hnn3Xut1bitSyw,10/23/2019,4 star rating,"Rounded up to 4 stars as it's very respectable that only a mum and daughter team operate the restaurant, their Thai iced tea was quite nice too ($3).Originally aimed to go to Khao Kang but saw that this place was well-received on yelp. Located in a very obscure part of Elmhurst which can make it hard to locate. I can't help but feel these guys would get a lot more service in a more visible location....Like many have commented, the interior in very unique and quirky, I like that they've recycled scrap pieces of wood. There is a small restroom just passed the counter, seating is enough for 12 people max. This place is a cash only too. We ordered chicken pad see eiw and their shrimp basil fried rice (this place does not charge extra for shrimp option! :D). Both dishes were wetter/saucier than I've had at any Thai restaurant, whilst this was a welcome change to my pad see eiw, texturally it was off putting in the rice dish. The basil fried rice (mild) had a good background heat to it and was abundant with shrimp and fresh basil which I liked. Another letdown though was that 2 of the shrimp were undercooked which can be potential for food poisoning. The pad see eiw had well-balanced flavours, noodles were deliciously chewy, I was digging the extra sauciness, there were good amounts of greens,chicken and egg. Portion sizing was on the smaller side, compared to the serving of the basil fried rice.Price-wise, this place runs on the cheaper side compared against the average Thai restaurant. They have a inexpensive snack menu comprising of waffles, fries etc. I'm assuming to cater to the school kids of the neighbourhood, they sell bubble tea too.*there is no high chairs, so not very suitable for children under 5. Too many decorative for little ones to destroy too."

Recommend getting it with the curry sauce. I wasn't really a fan of the chicken & shrimp dumplings because it felt like too much going on and there was no real flavor to it. Their pad Thai was also very good, not as greasy as other places make it and flavorful! Thai iced tea is a must with Thai food and this place did not disappoint!"

It has a earthly aesthetic with wood like tables & stools and lit with string lights and the location is mostly quiet as well as encouraged to keep it that with a sign saying ""Respect others & please be quite."" One thing most important to me is the lack of being able to use a card. It is a cash only location.

We ordered 2 pad thai's with chicken, 2 orders of chicken wings and steamed dumplings (it looked like shumai). The wings and dumplings were excellent and hot in temperature. The pad thai's were sad looking. My pad thai lacked true Thai flavors, noodles were clumped stuck together in a mushy noodle mess. It had a light, light brown sauce instead of the general brown, glossy, caramel-ly look of Thai pad thai. Go figure. I don't know what happened on their end."

Finally I had a chance to try it out today. My bf & I drop by for brunch. It is located in a residential area thats why not a lot of people know about this cafe. Theirs a lot of parking space outside & makes it easier for us. We walk in & noticed the cute decor. I really like interior. Cute & relaxing. The place is run by the owner. The one who take order & cook the food is the owner & makes me feel that its gonna be really good. Homecook type of food is always the best! Feels like my mom is cooking food for me. The owner is so sweet & smiling. Food:Papaya salad- spicy & juicy. The sauce is so delicious! I love papaya salad & this is really good. Beef basil- egg & chicken on the side. The best beef basil we ever had sp far. Its spicy, taste amazing & flavorful. Big portion of food! Grilled chicken teriyaki sauce- they have 2 more sauce like tamarind and another one but they recommended this sauce & it was exactly how I want it. I barely pick teriyake sauce because I don't like very sweet sauce but this one is perfect. Not to sweet & juicy. I'm glad we went & enjoy everything & thats not gonna be our last visit. My bf & I loves the food. I higly recommend! It was authentic thai food & big porting that will surely make you full. I didn't even finish my food & took it home. Definitely a great place to hang out & study! If you're in the neighborhood this is a place for lunch! Thumbs up!!"

It's probably the worse Malatang I've ever had in my life and it's not cheap either. I cannot believe they'd charge 17.95 for this... Why was it bad you might ask? The taste was bland (I got the fish), barely any fish.. And the few that were in there.. Tasted overcooked and old. As for the other ingredients...literally no where to be found cause it was mainly all soup and chili oil. Also there were no noodles either!!...What Malatang has no noodles....I ate everything cause I was so hungry and I was still hungry after...oh man I was so sad after this meal. I should have known.. And should have just gotten taiwanese stuff instead. Please go somewhere else other than this place for Malatang.Instead, just get what they are known for.. which is the fried chicken and porkchop stuff. I'm actually now scared to try their other noodle stuff cause I am so turned off by the pricing to quality of the Malatang. Literally it should have been a 5 dollar dish. It's that bad and disappointing.I'm giving a 3 star mainly cause their chicken cutlet was good.. Had to just eat that from my husbands dish. It has a lot of flavor and the chicken was moist. But even so, the fried chicken dish was filled with 3/4 rice and it's also $17ish."

Their beef noodle soup is on point!  The oyster pancake was made just right.. crunchy and a little gooey. They also offer a selection teas and desserts. Their portions are very generous.  Popcorn chicken and the fried pork chops were crunchy and nicely seasoned. I also ordered take out and tried their tomato beef noodle soup..at first I thought they forgot to give me the soup but it turns out to be creative and ingenious packaging..the soup was separate from the noodles on the top and in the same bowl..great idea! A bowl that sits on top of the bowl.. Service was quick. They are on Uber and Doordash for delivery. There is a kiosk to order or you can order at the counter. The place was very clean and inviting. I'm definitely coming back. Great food and great service. There's a small parking lot in front but there's local parking that you can find behind the restaurant."

1646,L-MYHMnRCIW6JytR8Ys2jQ,12/12/2022,5 star rating,A good beef noodle soup should give you a warm feeling like home. The soup is complex and flavorful without being overly seasoned.  You can taste the spices but it's not too overwhelming. The only thing was the beef was a little chewy.  It was closer to 4.5 then 4. The braised pork over rice. The pork fat made the rice a little greasy but it's pork was so tender. Everything was flavored as expected. I don't see too many taiwanese restaurants in the area as before. Its nice to have one so tasty.

It wasn't busy, so there was no reason for there to be any problem with time management. It took about over an hour to get our food ready, although we didn't order much- two orders. The lady who took our order was quite rude and had to be constantly reminded that we were still waiting for our food. Requests for the food to be spicy were forgotten. The food wasn't all that great either, which is a shame because it actually was a couple of years ago. We chose this spot to eat from because we thought it would be convenient, but that wasn't that case at all."

It is amazingly similar to regular Chinese restaurants, and taste amazing in comparison. We almost always get it delivered to us and they give a free can of soda if over $10. We almost always order the chicken with broccoli, but some times we get very small amounts of chicken, and too much broccoli. They give sauce packets, but they give so few packets unless you ask them for extra. All in all, this place has great tasting food with only a few flaws.

The chilaquiles had a balanced flavor of acidity, savory, and fat (from a runny egg). The salsa could have been a bit more spicy for my liking/challenge (I have medium tolerance for spiciness) and the egg could have been salted more evenly. I am peeved when food is salted but only in a concentrated area. Otherwise, everything like the ambiance and service were great!"
1661,4fQuriJ0mFzzG6RE1cRV5A,8/17/2021,5 star rating,"Incredible experience here. It's a small restaurant with seating for 16 guests. The service was outstanding. Our waiter was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. His service was on par and even better than some high end and Michelin star restaurants that we've dined at. He knew everything about all their menu items. The food was outstanding. We started with their special for the day - a carnitas taco and a scallop taco. They had blue masa tortillas which appeared to be hand made. They were topped with some cilantro and onions. We added on their green Chile sauce. The tacos were simple yet outstanding. The scallops were seared perfectly. They were only $4 and were way better than some of the scallops we've had a higher end steakhouses and seafood restaurants.Next, we had the sope and the chilequilos which are two similar dishes with the main difference being the base of the dish. The Sope had a blue masa bowl while the chilequilos had a bunch of chips. I ate more of the chilequilos. The chips at the bottom became intentionally soggy. Soggy usually has negative connotations in regards to food (especially chips) but these were great with the softer texture. The toppings were all great too with the chorizo standing out to me.We also had their French toast which was topped with bananas, strawberries, and whipped cream. Another fantastic dish. The texture of the French toast was on point. It was fruity and earthy without being overwhelmingly sweet.All in all, it's a fantastic experience and ultimately one of the best values for a meal New York!"

My favorite plates are Buttermilk Chocolate Chip pancakes and Strawberry Banana French Toast. The waiters are attentive and move quickly. The only area of growth is the wait time. I've waited up to an hour to get a table on a Saturday afternoon. They need a better system for keeping track of who's waiting for a table and making the line move quickly.

As long as you order early in the morning before 11:30am they usually are fine. The restaurant after that time is just severely under staffed. The employees try their best to accommodate but this is really a reflection of management. The food quality and taste for me has never been the problem which is why I go back. It's the chaos around getting your food. I generally call in and place my order 3/5 they will forget something. There is also no consistency as to how they package food. 1st time I ordered the waffle combo with eggs and bacon; they separated the waffle from the sides. This time I ordered they sat the waffle on top of the eggs and bacon. I like my eggs over medium so with the waffle on top pretty much cooked the egg. I also tried Uber eats from here... don't do it. They took so long preparing the food, the driver waited for 45 min and canceled my order because it still wasn't ready. I was particularly pissed because I received no warning that my food order would be canceled and even though he waited 45 min it was an 1 hour and 15 min from placing my order to being notified my food was canceled. There's definitely opportunity for growth here but it'll have to be a top down approach starting with hiring more staff."

1681,kCth1uap4j7uaXO0tUWf_A,8/24/2021,5 star rating,Not sure why some of these other ratings seem low! I personally rarely write reviews but this place is worth it! Amazing combo of Indian street food and more classic dishes! Every time I go here I get a sense of nostalgia as they also sell some of my favorite Indian snacks ! I would highly recommend going here for a lunch or more casual dinner - for either take out of dining in!
1682,kCth1uap4j7uaXO0tUWf_A,10/13/2020,5 star rating,"Desi Galli is an authentic Indian street food restaurant nestled in a little storefront just next to Tompkins Square Park.It serves reasonably priced authentic street food and also has some of the American Indian food classics like the plethora of Tikka masala variants.I ordered the Kathi rolls, the paneer biryani and the masala fries.The kathi rolls were incredible. I recommend the paneer bhurji. The filling was moist and the paratha was the perfect balance between crispiness and softness.The biryani was flavorful and not overwhelmingly spicy. The fries were also crispy and glassy on the outside, while being soft on the inside. For the price, this is one of the best quick Indian food joints on this side of the city.If you like this place you'll also like Thelewala in NoHo."

They would only communicate by text. After two hours, they texted me that the food would arrive in 45 minutes and they refused to provide a reimbursement or even credit for their terrible service! Ridiculous, a three hour wait to deliver within two blocks! Will dispute the ~$70 charge and find myself a GOOD  Indian restaurant.  Please beware!!"
1684,kCth1uap4j7uaXO0tUWf_A,2/7/2018,3 star rating,"Glad that the Alphabet City location opened up as I probably would never have trekked to Kips Bay to try this out. Tuesday evening and no one else inside the surprisingly spacious spot.Big Board off to the side displaying the plethora of options available. Decided to get the Chicken Tikka Masala Curry ($12), Paratha ($2), and the Palak Patte Ki Chaat ($5). While waiting, the lady behind the counter gave us free masala chai to start. A little lukewarm, yet a good starter to get the appetite going. Chaat comes out first and is layered nicely - chickpeas, pakora, onions, chutney and yogurt all blended together for a good bite. The chicken masala has a bright red color but unfortunately very sweet. Had to add some yogurt to balance out the flavor a bit. Chicken pieces were tough on top and more tender towards the bottom of the dish. Paratha is on the stale side, helped when dipping into the curry. Yelp checkin also offers a free Gulab Jamun side - 3 heavily sweetened treats that you can probably just have one of. Service here goes above and beyond, despite being more of a takeaway place. Food really depends on what you get here, would like to try the sliders next time."
1685,kCth1uap4j7uaXO0tUWf_A,5/26/2021,5 star rating,"I am so thankful for this spot and love that they are open in COVID 19. I think this is one of the more economical spots to order in from during the pandemic. And I wanted to stop by here to elaborate exactly on that 1)  this spot is economical for indian spots in the east village and Murray hill neighbourhood. I usually get1 of the paneer or chicken rolls which costs around 8 dollars per roll. The tricky thing is seamless usually has a delivery charge, which I don't super love, but for the price of the food itself- it's good value for money. 2)  from a food perspective, some of my favorite things that I highly recommend for an easy dinner are:A) Pao Bhaji - vegetables mashed in a onion and tomato gravy served with bread. It's a staple Indian street food and Desi Galli is the best spot to get it at in the city B) Paneer Roll or Chicken Bihari rolls- a paneer or chicken filling stuffed in a wheat or flour bread- so so good and spicy. C) Yellow dal with rice- this is what home cooked food is all about. I think it's priced relatively cheaper than other Indian restaurants and for the quality and taste, I think can easily become 2 meals for 13ish dollars the curry costs D) I love Rasmalali, I just don't always know if they make theirs fresh and is the one sticking point- but if you're craving it once and a while, I highly recommend getting it. Overall, the staff is extremely friendly and I do a lot of pickups from them as well- always greeted with a smile and a short wait!"

I had been tempted for months to come and eat the fried chicken sandwich with slaw here from a picture the business owner uploaded to Yelp. It was good, but it was lacking the spice I was hoping for in the slaw. The service was the best part to me. I dined alone and was chatted up by my server the perfect amount to make me feel welcome but was not ove the top. Nice selection of drinks but with just an OK happy hour. The environment here is casual but put together. It's very enjoyable. I plan on coming back to try some snacks and the burger. 4/5"

And I like that.It's dimly lit, cozy, and has comfortable seating. The tables are roomy and the cocktail menu is certainly interesting. I went with the Agua Fresca - tequila, mezcal (let me clarify, HEAVY on the mezcal), watermelon, lime, and jalapeno. In retrospect, this wasn't the best drink choice for someone who isn't crazy about mezcal, but it was definitely unique so I'm happy I gave it a try. I think next time I'd opt for the Berry White cocktail instead, or maybe just one of their beers.The best part about sitting here on a late night?

1694,Rk6TXh7nINbzJoGtI2C5cA,3/13/2019,2 star rating,"What item has greater potential to be the perfect, most versatile bar snack than a hot serving of salty, crispy french fries? A lesser venue might leave you longing for surprise with a meager offering of bar nuts, pretzels or goldfish. Bua's menu has 'bigs,' dominated by sandwiches, burgers and one taco offering, sharing space with 'snacks and shares,' delighting with buffalo sprouts, beer buttered fried pickles and onion dip. Even amongst these tempting options, the fries easily stood out as the crowd pleasing favorite that accommodated all dietary restrictions in our party. The prospect of a serving of fries to be shared with your friends during after work drinks is hard to resist. It promises everything you'd desire for both your taste buds and your social gathering. It's carb rich, it promises to be crispy, it promises steaming heat exhaling from every bite, it promises a comforting and familiar sting of the salt that ushers you home to your very reason for visiting at happy hour - your cold beer.A serving of bar fries doesn't need to aspire to much to be satisfyingly adequate. All they really need to be, is easily ignorable. To provide social and conversational lubricant between sips of beer and gaps in conversation. Perhaps they might steal attention away from your friends for just a moment, because they're just so good. At their most exceptional, you even might all be too busy wolfing them down to ever stop to comment on them. The silence testament to your companys shared mind and presence together.These fries distracted and diverted our conversation for all the wrong reasons. At a time of catching up and celebration, these hijacked our attention from one another and stole us away from ourselves. They were much too salty.(Try the luscious grilled cheese instead, I recommend the gruyere with tomato and onion.)"

Every time I place a Seamless order, the driver ends up calling saying that they do not have what I ordered, so I ask him to ask them why is it on the menu. Of course I get no response. So this time I decided to Google the phone number of the restaurant and call them and ask them before I place the order, I do and I press one for the team member, and I got another message saying press one for the team member, and I got another message saying press one for the team member. Clearly the chickens are running the asylum at this stupid franchise. So then I went ahead and placed my order again, and guess what? It was canceled."

We even had a mini photo shoot up there. Yea, photographers...do iiiit.Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast around 10 with about 10 other people. We ordered online because we weren't sure we'd make it in time to order off the breakfast menu. Turns out breakfast ends at 10:30 afterall though it says 10 am online. They just wanted us to have a heart attack is all. Why you gotta do us like that, NY?The restaurant was clean and well kept. They said ""my pleasure"" which was a pleasure.

If you used their mobile app, it will give you a code to enter into the check-in tablet in the pick-up area. Once your food is ready, an employee will bring out your food and call out your name. On one occasion an employee called out Emily instead of my name and was kind of mean towards me as she thought I was trying to take a girl's food! :)The food here was your standard Chick-fil-A food. It's the reason why there's always a long line at any Chick-fil-A. Eat mor chikin! :)Although I always took my order to go, I saw that this location had multi-level dining area upstairs."

I came on a Saturday afternoon around 4ish and to my surprise the line was almost hitting the door. No biggie, it's chick fil a. It's to be expected. There was employees coming to the line to take orders, which i assumed would make the line run quicker. surprisingly, it did not. As i waited in line for what seemed like forever, when i finally got to the register, she asked my name, which i told her, and she went to grab my order. After waiting at the register for what seemed like an eternity, my food was placed down, and the cashier ran off again to grab my drink. While my food sat by the wet ice that one of the employees just finished spilling all over the place while trying to refill ice bins. Neither that employee nor my cashier attempted to move my bag of food away from the ice that was now causing a puddle under and around my paper take away bag. The cashier finally came back after 5 mins to inform me that they were out of sweet tea for my half and half. Annoyed already, i asked for just lemonade, which took another 5 mins. The entire time employees are speaking amongst themselves laughing and paying little to no attention to the customer. (The joys of living in nyc) this location used to be better. The service needs to improve. Especially during a busy time like lunch rush. Also, it would be nice for everyone to get on the same page because i really wanted that half and half. The three stars are for the deliciousness that is chick fil a. The service blows. Probably will go to the others further uptown in the city. The customer service there is always top notch (which is what you'd expect from chick fil a) this location you definitely felt like you were in McDonald's. Horrible!"

I usually mobile order 5-10 minutes ahead.  My order would be ready in 5 minutes or less of entering the store as they have they separate pick up line for mobile orders. The staff are also very kind and don't mind going to the back to make sure your order hasn't been skipped. I always get a spicy chicken sandwich with Chick-Fil-A sauce and it always tastes great."

Between numerous tourists and NYC workers, I can imagine is must be tough to maintain a courteous, helpful, and professional demeanor. But the staff here manages to assume great attitudes across the board. Today I was helped by Michael, who ensured that my order was fully taken of immediately upon my arrival. The store was very busy, but he never made me feel as if I were imposing on his time - in fact, Michael helped me as if I were the only customer there, even as he was working with multiple parties.

Plenty of times here at Fulton Street, crowds are redic, redic but to be fair a lot of friends I know that work in that area do not like the average food choices around in this area in general.Chick Fil A does serve its purpose in that area to get a quick bite. Milkshakes in general are something you should get here. Salads are an option as well if you do not want the traditional chicken sandwich or spicy chicken sandwich. The place is huge, there is even a rooftop area which I have yet to see. Overall, the place just needs to improve customer service and reduce customer wait time. Good to have the place around or course it is just now open on Sundays to satisfy your chicken cravings. Grilled Chicken Nuggets are also very underrated, try this in the future."

I went about an hour before they closed and was pleased to experience friendly customer service by the person working there. He offered me samples to try of the different broths and shared with me the different options. The reason I gave Brodo a 3, versus a 4 or 5, is because of the product & price. I got the heart broth with turmeric, ginger and the seaweed/sea vegetable blend added in. I was disappointed that the ""freshly grated turmeric"" was actually chopped in chunks. It wasn't blended into the broth in any way, so I'm not sure I even got any health benefits from it floating in there. And biting into a chunk of turmeric isn't my idea of a great broth experience. When I finished drinking the broth there was an inch deep of chopped turmeric and sea vegetables. I ate some of them, but those are some strong flavors to eat on their own. The turmeric could be better off actually grated, so it is a bit more eatable, or even fresh turmeric powder that can really blend into the broth would be great. Or, if the turmeric is going to be chopped, then maybe stick it all into a blender for a bit, to mix it all into the broth, so that all the health benefits of these nutrient-dense add-ins can be realized!I got a small cup of broth for ~$10. It's definitely not cheap for what you get, but if you're really craving some bone broth, check it out."

Since that last visit, I've ordered from them numerous times. You can get a 96oz box of broth with many different condiments to make your own combinations. I am completely sold on this concept!!"

Although a restaurant is considered to be in the hospitality industry, I think it's important to remember the difference between a chain/large restaurant and a neighborhood joint. Old Baku just sort of does things their own way. You should know going in that this is not the place to complain that your food is cold, the meat isn't cooked the way you want it, etc. So a group of 4 of us recently went back, and we again ordered the assorted kebab platter. This is good for a few people because it's has 4 meats (chicken, beef, lamb, and liver) plus french fries. This time I asked for a beer but I was told they no longer serve alcohol - maybe they lost their license? They appeared to be BYOB though (there is a liquor/wine shop across the street). Also ordered a couple of salads to share and the bread, which was plenty for all of us.It was a Saturday, which I guess was karaoke night. There was a DJ setup but no DJ - just a karaoke machine where some drunk folks sang in Azerbaijani. Just go with it. And currently it's cash only.I think if you go in with an adventurous attitude, you'll like this place."
1722,2dkrCgx3h8hPRdkoj0QJjw,2/9/2018,4 star rating,"Had lunch here on a Friday.  I ordered the Piti, which was a decent clear soup with pretty tender lamb meat.  I also had the old Baku salad, which was mushy mix of vegetables and wasn't as visually appealing as I expected, but it tasted okay.  The bread was excellent and baked fresh.  I also had the lamb kebab, with the meat presumably removed from the skewer and provided with an assortment of fries.  The meat was excellent and not gamey, while the fries were not particularly special.  The service was excellent, as a friendly young worker who had the most English fluency was attentive to my questions about the menu.  I also was provided some complimentary Azerbaijani candy and tea at the end.  I asked for water and I was given a bottle of Pelligrino that was $4; I'd surmise it was more of a language issue that I didn't get tap water.  In addition, they imposed a 10% service surcharge.  Finally, there's an open courtyard in the middle of the restaurant where people smoke, so the indoor dining area immediately next to it will be overwhelming with the scent of secondhand smoke for those who are sensitive.  After a while it was too stuffy and I needed to step outside for fresh air.  In the future I'd definitely come back to try out other food but I might take it to go because of the environment's smokiness."

I just wanted to one little place to serve as my little secret, something stashed in Ditmas Park. That's selfish and now that others have written, I'll add my rave to the pile.From what I understand, the ownership here is an Azeri Jewish family who came to New York from Baku with a stopover in Israel. The food, however, didn't pick up many Middle Eastern elements, it's Azeri with a dash of some pan-Soviet cuisine.Unless you speak Russian or Azeri, get ready to either completely relinquish control over what you eat or do a lot of explaining. There is now an English menu (this did not exist for a while) and a couple of waiters on any given night who speak the language pretty well. If you call ahead for a reservation, better to have a Russian friend do this. You'll do fine letting them order for you, but I generally require some customization. First off, the rather ordinary salad that they will want to give everyone can be skipped in favor of more interesting appetizers. You'll also need more of the giant circular breads to accompany both the first and second courses.I also fiddle with the roast meat, which is the main attraction. The liver that comes on the main platter has to go, replaced with additional lamb. Stugeon, perhaps the single greatest thing on the menu, won't come unless you ask for it (do). And skip the dessert they'll want to bring - usually there is so much meat that it's completely necessary.What is ordered, keep your eyes open while waiting for it.

This time I asked for a beer but I was told they no longer serve alcohol - maybe they lost their license? They appeared to be BYOB though (there is a liquor/wine shop across the street). Also ordered a couple of salads to share and the bread, which was plenty for all of us.It was a Saturday, which I guess was karaoke night.

You can't go wrong with their variety of flavors and toppings. On this trip, I enjoyed the cookies and cream combination and I topped mine off with bananas and strawberries.

Minis Celsius is a neat small shop with very short and efficient lines. The staff are very nice, although they seem a little shy/reserved. They offer unlimited toppings with your ice cream too.We got the strawberry rolled ice cream with all the fruits as toppings. I'm a big fan of hard serve ice cream and this exceeded my expectations. The ice cream was very rich and creamy and the strawberries used were nice and fresh. The fruits on top were also fresh and all sweet.Would love to come back here again to get some ice cream!"
1750,cAcazXWgluB_2-n0KbDQXQ,10/14/2019,3 star rating,Very solid rolled ice cream place. The Matcha Madness was def yummy. Only downside was the topping was quite little. I had mochi and coconut flakes as toppings but there were like 5 mochi in total and small portion of coconut flakes. When I finished all my toppings there were still like more than half ice cream left.
1751,cAcazXWgluB_2-n0KbDQXQ,2/15/2017,5 star rating,"5 stars automatically because they give you unlimited toppings for free. No one does that. Especially in the city. You walk into all of these gimmicky new ice cream/fro yo shops and its priced per ounce or an extra 25-50 cents per topping. Go hog wild, kids, because they are free of charge. This was my first time having rolled ice cream so I have nothing to really compare to it than other ice creams. But, I really enjoyed it. Watching the entire process in itself is mesmerizing. They made me a puppy dog shape out of chocolate sauce. I ordered the Nut cracker. Vanilla ice cream with nutella and graham crackers chopped into it. My friend ordered the vanilla cookie creation with just an oreo mashed up. Flavor - really good. This tastes like real ice cream. Texture - yeah, wait a minute or two before diving in because it did just come off an insanely frozen griddle and is a little stiff at first. Those toppings! I didn't go too crazy. Mostly pocky sticks and chocolate chips. But I like that I can throw anything I want on it from fresh fruits to cereal to m&ms to a melty marshmallow that's torched in front of you. This place does it right, is incredibly nice and they have adorable penguins on their walls."

My first time was in Queens and quite some time ago but I'm pretty confident that my rolled ice cream at Minus Celsius was better. Better flavor, much creamier and who doesn't love UNLIMITED TOPPINGS! Usually ice cream spots charge .50-1.00 for extra toppings - here you can get as much as you like. Sauce drizzles as well. The staff here was friendly efficient and their space was super clean. Great flavors, awesome looking signature mixes and a variety of toppings with something for everyone. I would definitely come back here again if I were close by."

So when I saw rolled ice cream, I was intrigued. I'm a fan of eating ice cream when it's cold outside because I feel like you can get the true flavor without it melting everywhere. So knowing that I was going to eat ice cream that was minus ten degrees Celsius was super exciting.For $7 you get ice cream with unlimited toppings. I ordered the thai tea ice cream with condensed milk and mochi. The ice cream was pretty good but you definitely are paying for presentation. If I'm down by the area, I might eat here again.

1756,cAcazXWgluB_2-n0KbDQXQ,6/22/2016,1 star rating,"The place is empty. An employee was eating his meal by the window. Trash was scattered on the tables and floor. Starkness appeared to be the theme. A worker told us we can have up to 3 toppings for the matcha choice on their board. Hmm... But why are there signs indicating otherwise, words screaming UNLIMITED TOPPINGS! Not even kidding, their paper printed sign on the glass near the register and huge chalkboard on the wall have the words 'unlimited toppings' in caps. Why were we limited to just three?? The employee didn't bother to correct herself despite her hearing us lamenting over this occurrence. I suppose this is how they were taught to operate aka dispense poor information, proceed to halfheartedly execute the order, and pray for closing time.Starting off with the wrong foot, one can only hope it won't go further down. Well, one is wrong. It can get worse, it did, and it nearly broke that dang foot. The ice cream was barely rolled properly, probably due to the inexperienced staff and poor quality of ingredients. The ice cream was super dry, crumbly, and didn't taste good at all. The ""rolls"" disintegrated immediately after digging the spoon in; your dessert basically tumbles over in the bowl and spoon before you even take a bite. Lord have mercy, this place needs some serious help in management, hygiene, and general customer service skills."

Helen, one of the top notch bartenders at this seemingly ""locals only"" watering hole, makes this place the neighborhood gem that it is. She knows everyone by name, what they drink, and their whole life story. She always makes you feel welcome, and is the reason I have a slight beer gut now. Initially, I was bummed that they don't have a wider selection of craft beers (or any at all). But I quickly realized that would actually ruin this place. Ready Penny must remain what it is: An authentic, Queens style Irish pub. We don't want to become like Brooklyn, do we?They don't serve food, but I personally feel it's for the best. Just walk your happy ass to a nearby Halal cart. The prices are right, football Sunday's are super fun, I've met some really good people, and if you're not careful, you'll be a regular as well."

It's a true dive bar and will be best enjoyed with good friends or a may relaxes group of people. Ready Penny is a no frills bar and will probably have you feeling like you're in a bar from one of your favorite TV shows. There's a pool table, jukebox, darts, and a lottery ticket dispenser.  You can truly get lost in here; I completely forgot I was in Jackson Heights until I walked out onto 73rd Street."
1761,graCalOReFFFOaC0febodw,8/29/2013,3 star rating,"The dive bar oasis of Jackson Heights. We tried Ready Penny because everyone should have a go to dive bar near their apartment for emergencies. We showed up on a Saturday afternoon to test the day drinking potential of the place.Sandwiched between an Indian grocery and a Pakistani fashion shop, the Penny is noticeable for its heavy wood doors that almost make you feel like this is someone's house and not a business. Opening the door will take you back to every other Irish bar you've been to in America. It's dark, somber and just a little sad. There are always at least four people of a certain age here, reading the paper,  watching TV and  drinking whiskey. It's a place where people go so they can say they got out of the house but can still do the same things they do at home.The lady bartenders are nice depending on which one you get, and the drinks are small no matter who's behind the bar. Your drinks could be barely alcoholic to extremely strong depending on the mood of the lady. It's proximity to the train and it's lack kf convenient competition will keep me coming back but Penny won't have much appeal to anyone outside the hood.Have fun.G"

Helen is a stellar bartender! She is lovely, kind, hilarious and treats patrons like family. For the folks who thinks she's rude, guaranteed THEY are the assholes. It's no frills, and you can engage as much or as little as you'd like. I also enjoyed conversation with the regulars. Please do yourself justice and check out this bar, it will soon be your favorite."

Only problem was the bartender. The whole time she was joking around with everyone until she got busy. And drunk. All of sudden she became super rude. Why are you in the  service industry if you don't like people? I think that you're nothing without good customer service and that was definitely missing. If you want to hang out with your friends at the end of the bar, do it on your day off. I will not be returning and I would suggest you go to the million other bars that have liquor.

I've never had a problem with their drinks before, and like I said, I usually get a drink once a week so I buy a lot from here. But tonight I couldn't even finish my drink because I was scared a wood chip would hurt my throat or stomach!! Very disappointed, they might've lost a loyal customer tonight."

1775,E7bXW2tsCV4c8WCeeV8z_g,3/20/2017,5 star rating,"Real rating 4.5:Came here with my girlfriend because this place just opened and we love boba.The promotion of BOGO sounded was really enticing, except that it only applied to certain drinks (i dont think it applied to the OG milk tea w/ bubbles). My gf tried the oolong milk tea and said that oolong was n-oolong-er her favorite (haha bubbly puns). She said black tea was really good, so we got the 3Q milk tea. 3Q consists of pudding, grass jelly, and bubbles. I've had 3Q's at other bubble tea shops so I sorta knew what it was going to taste like.This place loses 1 star for the limited BOGO options, however it gains 0.5 stars for it being much closer than the 14th street branch."

There was an issue in the kitchen so food was late coming out, as soon as they realized our food would be late they let us know, comped a drink for each of us, and updated us regularly. Despite the kitchen issues, the food was amazing! And so reasonably priced, especially for the upper east side. Great with gluten free, a clearly labeled menu and they asked if anyone had an allergy prior to me getting a chance to tell them myself"
1778,wLXLrpQrPAZeUG7nd8MInw,3/8/2023,4 star rating,"Ordered lunch special, $22 - vegetable soup, fried chive pancake, massaman curry with crispy duck. All of the food was GREAT! Curry was not spicy at all and duck was cooked perfectly. Will definitely come back here. Please note - although the menu says the lunch special is until 4 pm, if you are ordering for pick up on the phone it is actually only until 3:45. I think updating the menu to state this would be helpful, as they almost didn't allow me to place my order."
1779,wLXLrpQrPAZeUG7nd8MInw,10/23/2022,4 star rating,"This restaurant's lunch special always leaves me bursting at the seams in a good way. It consists of a vegetable soup, a petite appetizer, and an entree. My favorite combo is soup with the fried chive pancake appetizer and spicy cashew nut chicken entree. The bland soup comes alive when paired with the saltiness of the chive pancake. The cashew nut chicken is flavorful and spicy and pairs well with a refreshing glass of Thai Tea Lemonade.I love the dimly lit dining room with the colorful lantern lighting display. Outdoor dining and bar seating are also available!Service is courteous and prompt and the location is only a two-minute walk from the 72nd Street subway station (Q line)."

We always get the pad thai and fried rice. All the other noodle dishes are good as well. I like their chive pancakes and am a big fan of their lunch set specials. The portions are huge and we never have anything to complain about."

Beautiful decor inside, lovely lanterns, wood panels and exposed brick.The platings were much larger than I thought they would be based on past Yelp reviews with photos. The steamed dumplings were better than your average ones. Pad Thai was delicious and par for what you expect. The pineapple fried rice was a great balancing act for the fried pork belly dish I got - Thai street food for the win!Nukie was such a friendly server, super helpful. Smile helped make the meal! Took my mom here while my father was recovering from surgery, and they will definitely be back!"

We ordered thai iced tea, pad thai, up thai fried rice claypot, branzino fish with sweet chili sauce, lemongrass lemon chop and green curry with duck. My favorites were definitely the fish and curry. The fish was cooked well and had a good amount of meat in it. and the curry had great flavorI will say that everything was on the sweeter side and I missed the classic Thai spicy/tangy flavor. sadly none of the dishes we ordered had that. I'm glad we all shared our dishes so I was able to try different things. prices were also good for the portions!"

The menu here is amazing- contained some more authentic thai dishes outside of your typical pad thai. we got a chicken dish, pork dish, and calamari to share and im glad we shared because portions are huge but trying more things is always the MOVEour chicken had rice wrapped in a banana leaf for extra moisture and stickiness - delicious especially with the sauces that came on the sidethe pork fried rice was a little more on the sweet side - i mixed in the sauce that came with the chicken for some more flavor but the veggies with the rice and pork paired well together and were so savory. all meats were cooked and seasoned perfectly well. definitely recommending this spot!"

You will break bread dining here but if you know that ahead of time, you'll be just fine.  Actually,  go on youtube and put this place in your search, try to find the episode on munchies, chefs night out and let the owner win you over. If you like the episode, you'll like this spot. Nuff said"

The chicken had the perfect crispy texture to it and the radish perfectly complemented the flavors. The legendary burger was juicy and I loved the sauce on it. The restaurant had a fun vibe to it. Next time when I'm hungrier, I would definitely splurge for the tasting menu."
1789,-OixbLnFLCzQclxCSbUQ8w,9/16/2022,5 star rating,"Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner. I think this is a new fusion favorite. Some supremely indulgent dishes and lots of killer flavors. After hearing Nowon was the new buzz in town, I had to go see for myself. I'm always... slightly disappointed... when it comes to American-fusion spots, but this was so far from disappointment.Legendary burger: 10000/10This was really, really, really good. Juicy drippy burger patty that tasted fresh, zingy flavorful kimchi mayo, tangy pickles and onion to cut through the grease, soft bun all tied with... AMERICAN CHEESE? Just... so awesome. I think one of the top burgers I've had.Chopped Cheese Rice Cakes: 1000/10Again... I don't really think fusion is swung well when it's American food + insert other cuisine. But this was insane.These rice cakes were so chewy and pillowy. Paired with the indulgence of beef and cheese and yummy tomato...  I would've never thought this would taste so good but here we are. I would go back for this. Spicy Coconut Shrimp: 9/10Filling for the size, these shrimp were sweet, tangy, nutty, and sour thanks to the lime and peanuts. I appreciated that they aren't breaded, so the dish was a little lighter than it could've been. The tomato and thai basil also paired nicely. Broccolini: 9/10OK this was like the only meh BUT it wasn't because of the sauce. The anchovy black sesame miso flavor KILLED it, but the broccolini could've been steamed or cooked a little longer as it was a little tough. That's ALL. It was still BOMB.The only drink we got was the ""THAT KUNG FU FROM JEJU - Plum Soju, Rum, Orange Blossom."" Our waitress described it as an old fashioned which I don't know if I agree but it was really great. Strong flavor but still light and not too boozy somehow. I'd get this again.Overall, you need to come here and you've definitely gotta get the burger and rice cakes!"

We did the EP tasting menu, and our favorite dishes were the chopped cheese rice cakes, legendary burger, and the lamb skewers. The flavors were incredible in everything  we ate, and the service was fantastic, too. We had a great time, and I am so happy we tried this place!"
1791,-OixbLnFLCzQclxCSbUQ8w,11/16/2022,5 star rating,"Nowon was amazing.  The food was excellent and for the price for the pre fix ($48pp) you get a lot for your money.  We decided to add the ricotta dip as an additional appetizer, which was delicious, as well as the shrimp skewer as an additional item because we wanted the salad instead of the skewer as part of the pre fix. But, you really don't need to order anything additional than what comes with the set menu as it is a lot of food.  For the items that you could choose between, we opted for the kale salad (which was phenomenal), and the Legendary Burger (also fabulous).  We ordered the extraordinary tots and got half of them curry flavor and the other with honey butter - both delicious, but I preferred the honey butter.  I would definitely come back!"
1792,-OixbLnFLCzQclxCSbUQ8w,6/30/2022,3 star rating,"First off, the Legendary Burger (basically the entire reason we came) is great. Smashed patties, juicy and filling with just the right amount of cheese and just the right spiciness level on the sauce. Sesame seeded roll was a little plain, but I didn't mind. On par with a burger I'd expect from Burger and Barrel or David's Cafe, two of the best in Manhattan. Cocktails ($18) were pretty hit-or-miss. Nothing that really wowed me. The ""What's Up Fatlip"" made with mezcal, pineapple juice, and anise was just okay. The ""Old Fashioned As Fuck"" included both rye whiskey and rum, combined with cinnamon. May have been too much there. Starters ($13-18 each) all had pretty small portion sizes. We had grilled octopus skewers, charred lamb skewers, Korean fried chicken (four small pieces), charred broccolini (this was decent; had a parmesan sauce I think), coreano corn cheese, and honey butter tater tots (too sweet). Service was friendly. I noticed that for most of the tables it seemed to take a while to get the food out, but that may be due to labor shortages given the unique macroeconomic environment we're still living in. It is a very loud restaurant. We were at a small three person table right in front near the window; despite our proximity to each other, it was still hard to make out what each of us was saying."
1793,-OixbLnFLCzQclxCSbUQ8w,6/10/2022,4 star rating,"Giving the place 3.5-4 stars as most dishes were good, but there were a couple of misses in during the entire experience.1.) The cucumber salad was tasty but it was entirely too salty and the crispy tofu was crazy dense. I thought maybe it could be some other weird starch.2.) The tater tots with curry were great. super crunchy and the curry stood out3.) The legendary burger is good, but it had no korean flavor at all from the kimchi mayo. The beef was crusty and flavorful but it also tasted mostly of ""american"" cheese.  4.) The kimchi fried rice was good with some crunchy rice from the hot pan it was served in. I think it could of used more kimchi for sure. Also it is weird that it is the second most expensive dish after the truffle burger especially given it's relatively small size. Also I prefer spam over mortadella, but I get it they are trying to be fancier."
1794,-OixbLnFLCzQclxCSbUQ8w,11/4/2022,4 star rating,"Finally visited this spot after seeing it on tiktok so many times! We walked in on a Thursday evening, and they were all booked with reservations. Thankfully, they were able to seat us at one of their outside booths for an hour till the next reservation! Even though they're outside, the booths are really warm because they have a strong heater inside, and you can close the doors. They also decorated it well and have nice lights, so it's vibey and private.We ordered the dry-aged steak burger and the 'chopped cheese' rice cakes to share, and my friend ordered the transverse draft autumn ale as well.Both entrees were good, especially the dry-aged steak burger. I'm personally really not a fan of dry burgers, so I liked that they didn't skimp on the kimchi mayo! The kimchi mayo itself was solid, with the kimchi flavor being more noticeable than I was expecting. The bun was also really great!The 'chopped cheese' rice cakes were satisfactory too. The panko crumbs really added to the texture of the dish. And make sure to take each bite with a jalapeño because the kick of the jalapeños really rounds out the flavor by balancing out the slight creaminess! Overall, good food, but am not sure if I'll be back because for the price, the portion sizes were way too small. So make sure to order more entrees than the number of people! But definitely worth checking out once or on one of those days you feel like splurging on a burger!"

My personal favorite dish from Nowon is the Chopped Cheese Rice Cakes. If you like tteokbokki or chopped cheese, this is THE dish. It's cheesy, savory, and chewy, and the tomato and lettuce toppings compliment the hearty sauce well. We had an incredible dining experience here at Nowon. Everything we tried was above and beyond delicious.Definitely recommend."

The shop has limited indoor seating (for WFH purposes) but has benches outside as well! Would definitely recommend their signature drinks - they're a touch pricy for coffee but worth the treat! Their pastries are also very tasty - I love their almond croissants!

When I chanced upon Bird & Branch. It was nothing short of a heaven opening over some and guiding me inside. In my state of tiredness, here was like finding a jewel among the dust. Coming from Seoul, I am not easily impressed by New York's cafes. They're often tiny, cluttered, prizing their espresso but neglecting their interior or comfort. But here, I felt just welcomed. They have an eclectic list of speciality drinks (I got the Robin) and the girl at the counter must have seen the blackness in my eyes, and she said ""we could add an espresso shot to that."" I perched on the bench by the window. It's not cold inside, not hot inside, not stuffy nor spacious.  There is outdoor seating for nice weather days. They keep their space neat and organized. They have cute little breads and sweets and the atmosphere is just NICE. I'm so happy I chanced upon this cafe  I needed it."
1806,fxi3le9ZoP75Lw51QBG6uQ,3/30/2023,5 star rating,Would recommend this place if you love matcha drinks or need a quick place to work or catch up. The croissant was kind of hard but the matcha latte was so good! The place is very nice to study and do work at if you can find seats. There are no bathrooms so you might have to find a different place if you want to stay long. They also made a cute heart on my drink!

The hubby ordered a vanilla latte with their homemade almond macadamia nut milk.  It was served in a very large glass, beautifully crafted and served with a stainless straw.  I had a glass of their iced tea, which happened to be a passion fruit tea that day.  I loved how friendly everyone was, how welcoming the baristas were and glad the group of us hunkered indoors got to watch the snowfall together."

The atmosphere inside is clean and bright, and the owners are two of the kindest people I have ever encountered. The food is absolutely amazing- you must try the peanut butter cookie and the miso hummus toast. Their recipes for drinks and food alike are unique and memorable. You really can't go wrong no matter what you order. The Nightingale is a favorite drink of mine. It's next to most Broadway theaters and is open late, so it's great for a pre-show pick-me-up."

I love finding little coffee shops like this - small, independently owned, and highlights the coffee. The menu is limited, but I loved that - classic coffees but with their own interpretation. Each day we tried a different drink and were not disappointed!Couldn't recommend Bird & Branch more to anyone (local or visitor alike) who is looking for high quality coffee and a cute spot to catch up with a friend or get some work done!"

I've never had a problem in the 7 years I've been living in this neighborhood but in the last couple of days it's been difficult to get service. They're closed Mondays. But twice I went this week (Wednesday and Thursday) before 8pm and they've been closed. The Wednesday I walked in and they told me they were closed even though they had a customer. Idk, maybe they ran out of pizza. Thursday I walk up to the door and it's locked. The owners are sitting inside reading magazines/books. Just looked at me and then back down at their books. The sign said Open but they didn't have any customers. Why not just close the store if you're not going to serve any customers. Very frustrating considering there aren't any pizza places nearby. Closest one is on the other side of Qns Blvd."

Their pizza pie may cost you $15-18, slices for $3.This place need no recommendation because this is one famous pizza house in New York and not just in Queens.

This place is extremely loud and not ideal if you're trying to catch up with friends and actually have a conversation. I'm not sure if it's always like that or because it was a Friday night. Our server was also unfortunately not very friendly and rude. We told him that we were waiting on our friend who got stuck in traffic and he didn't seem to care. Basically kicked us out saying that we can only stay for more than an hour an half. Mind you there were plenty of people on there who had been been there way longer. So when my friend was finally able to make it we had to pay and go to another spot. The sangria I had was good but nothing amazing and the carnitas tacos were average. I will not be coming back here!

1850,6VkEYaQphDVsWy3C5Sh1Zg,6/25/2022,4 star rating,"My friends and I wanted to grab quick dinner before the Yankee's game, so we stumbled upon Jackdaw. The other people in my group had enjoyed their bottomless brunch, so they were curious to see how their dinner would compare. Our reservation was for the patio, so we were seated outside for our meal.The patio area is very nice and cozy. The seatings were comfortable and I didn't feel like I was too close to the other tables. The service was also very solid as I didn't feel like I had to wait too long to be seated or for any of my foods/requests.To start, my table ordered the margarita picantes. Personally, I enjoyed the picante seasoning as the spice was not too overwhelming to me and added a nice kick to my drink. My friends disagreed with me, however, where some thought that the seasoning on its own was very solid while others thought the seasoning mixed in the drink was the best way to enjoy the drink. The margarita itself was very typical, nothing out of this world, but still a solid drink.We then ordered a side of chips and guac as well as hummus with chicken shwarma. The portions for both appetizers were relatively small. The chips and guac were nothing extraordinary, and I think that the guac definitely could have benefited with more lemon juice/peppers/cilantro as it taste pretty bland. The hummus and chicken shwarma was very tasty, and I appreciated how the pita that the appetizer came with was a little crispy, which added a nice texture to the meal.For my meal, I ordered the al pastor quesadilla. The waitress informed me that the quesadilla was not going to be a normal quesadilla that folds on itself, but it was going to be more like a pizza. Even though she gave me this warning, I still thought that the base was going to be a soft tortilla. However, whenever it was presented to me, I realized that the base was a crunchier tortilla. As a result, when I took a bite of the quesadilla, the interior would be very chewy while the exterior was crunchy, not to mention that the base was thinner than I had hoped. The al pastor and sauce on top were delicious, though, so I have no complaints about the flavor itself.Overall, I definitely enjoyed my time at Jackdaw. I'd say my favorite part of the meal was the hummus and chicken shwarma, but if the quesadilla had a thicker base it definitely would have won me over. The service and ambiance of the place were very solid, so overall I'd say I had a good experience."

They are many ramen spots but not all of them make curry ramen so when I stumble across this place, I was so happy. I made it a habit to go by on a monthly basis since I live in queens. I've never found another ramen place that could match the level of flavor. Hence why I decided to try this location and I was disappointed. The flavors are lacking big time. I think they cater to the neighborhood so the broths are not pork bones but veggie base. Let's just say the neighborhood must be filled with people who don't know how to experience spices and flavor. Just one big disappointment. Maybe if I never experienced the other place I wouldn't be so critical of this place but I did and now it's gone ."

Upon figuring out what we wanted to eat, it took forever for the servers to come to our table. Granted, this was during lunch and a lot of the waitresses were busy. That I can understand, but what I can't comprehend is that all the waitresses seem to be focusing on their task at hand facedown. The waitress serving food at a table served the food and immediately turned around; the waitress giving out check to another table gave the check to the customer and turned around - we sat at the corner but no one was really paying attention to usThe food -Given that it was a ramen place, in hindsight, I probably should have ordered ramen. However, I was feeling rice that day, so I ordered chicken katsu which doesn't usually go wrong. The chicken katsu I imagined would be crispy, juicy, with tender meat. The chicken katsu I received had the crispy breading on the outside, but the chicken actually tasted rubbery... it's been a while since I had an unsatisfactory chicken katsu. The miso soup was also slightly bland. I will definitely think twice about coming back here again - maybe give their ramen a shot."

Presented nicely with mixed veggies but I was still hungry after attempting to pick at the meat portions.Pork buns made with soft white bao buns were good. Meaty pork belly with a sweet sauce. My parents each ordered chicken teriyaki on sizzling hot plates that I should've tried-- they loved it! At least their stomachs were full before we headed over to Highline for a walk. Oh, salmon sashimi was fresh!Service was very attentive and friendly with lots of wait staff always around. That's a plus. Kinda wish I'd ordered a roll to make up for the rice bowl.

Even though I'd prefer to sit outdoor if I dine at a restaurant, it was way too cold to even consider that option. They were able to seat us (5 people) right away. They did temperature checks and got the contact info of one person in the party in case they need to inform us of any potential exposure. When we were seated, they provided sanitizer for the table. I went into the restaurant thinking it was solely a ramen place. Their menu has more than just ramen though. I honestly think their ramen selection is a little lacking but they have a lot of options with rice bowls. I got myself the normal chashu ramen. It was good. The chashu was cut oddly thick and was tough which was a little disappointment. The broth was still very flavorful though. Because it was such a cold day, I really did appreciate the warmth of the broth but in terms of ramen, this place would not be my first choice."

My friend and I ordered gyoza and ramen. The ramen was lackluster at best (probably a compliment). I politely indicated to a server (not my own), that I didn't enjoy the ramen and we asked for the check. My server, John, came back and proceeded to state: ""I told you my recommendation and you ignored it, so this is your fault. I will void it but no other place in New York does this. If you're going to do this again, you shouldn't come back here.""I told John that 1. We hadn't asked for the ramen to be voided in the first place (the irony is that we'd expected to pay for it!) 2. I'm sure people send food back all the time. 3. We likely wouldn't come back given his tone. John walked away yelling at me, calling me ""GARBAGE"" several times. (I found it interesting that he yelled at me, a black woman, and not my white male friend. Hmmm). Other customers walked in and became involved indicating that his behavior was atrocious and racist, and demanded to speak with the manager. So as all of us stood at the counter, practically demanding contact information, this is what happened:- John first indicated that he was the manager (later learned that was a lie). - John then refused to give his name, as did the other employees there. - John called me a ""STUPID BITCH"". -  John refused to give us the manager's contact information. - John threatened to call the police on all of us (that would have been interesting.- All of John's coworkers remained awkwardly silent and also refused to give anyone's names or contact information. Only after ten minutes of demands (and the servers having learned that we were all affiliated with NYU or working in law, in one way or another), did they manage to provide the name of the manager. Thanks. I, as well as the customers that banned along side me, left refusing to ever return. You should follow suit. Bottom Line:Save your money and buy packaged Maruchan Ramen Noodles from Space Market next door. Or go to Peng's Noodle Folk on the UES (seriously, best ramen I've ever had and no drama ..also higher rating on Yelp.)Note: After viewing previous reviews from other customers, this seems like a common theme for this place.

Our party ordered both the vegetarian ramen as well as regular ramen with meat but it seemed as if both were made with the same bland broth. The noodles were so eggy that it felt like one egg had been cracked open into my mouth with every following bite, and honestly this with the bland broth just made it so I felt like I was eating wet soupy eggs. It may be the neighborhood or it may just be the restaurant, but plenty of ramen restaurants in New York have so much more flavor and ""authenticity"" in flavor to actual Japanese ramen."

(it was supposed to be ""on ice"" lol).the waiter scurried off and re-appeared with our bottle, more than a quarter full. this is the end of our meal now, yiiiikkkkkessssss. ""sorry,"" he said, and i realized this was maybe the third or fourth apology we'd received for something. the somm obviously never bothered to inform the server we had a bottle of wine, a communication lapse more akin to a roadside diner than a major food group restaurant.anyway. nice to be back, but i've grown too, it seems, and i'm not as easily impresed as i once was."

The two choices she provided were not good and I asked if she could recommend perhaps another one, at that point she threw her hands up and said loudly ""I don't know what you want"" I was surprised at this outburst and said I am sorry about any misunderstanding but I provided you a description and it's ok if you can't recommend anything, I'll just try the Rose.  She doesn't respond and walks away at this point I just stood up and left. Luckily someone at the hotel staff saw what was happening and apologized and sent a complimentary bottle of champagne to our room which we appreciate.  I understand that people have bad days but that's no excuse for you to take out your frustration on innocent people.

But now post-omicron/delta, I am back for good. It may take some time to get a rhythm going again. Klay Thompson doesn't go on hot streaks with 3-5 minutes a time.Dirty French is a questionably named -- yet ambiguously so -- French restaurant that's attached to a swanky hotel. The decor is a mishmash of influences: Nic Cage's ""National Treasure"" franchise (a random sphinx is placed near the ceiling), midnight bistro decor, and upscale bar. We had the mussels, chicken, pommes puree, and the tuna tartare, plus bargain-rate deviled eggs. All were amazing except the tartare, which was oppressively overspiced and clouds out the taste of the fish. I also highly recommend getting the desert. Go for the beignets. We ordered them and a more standard chocolate cake, and I anthropormorphized (sp) the cake and felt sorry for how poorly it stacked up against the exciting beignets."
1878,nBkSqOhZMa1A7Yk3q8VPaA,3/5/2021,4 star rating,"Sushi Seki has traditional sushi layout with seating and tables surrounding the sushi bar/chefs (aka the stars of the show). The quality is top notch here -- from the fish cut to the rice and the ratio of sushi to rice is great. As I mentioned with the decor, the sushi and other menu items are very traditional, no curve balls or towers of fancy ish. Items are on the pricier side, but not break the bank level so thats plus. Staff is very courteous and prompt. Although this is open late, I would say enjoy this in the best state of mind to really take in all the goodness."
1879,nBkSqOhZMa1A7Yk3q8VPaA,12/30/2022,5 star rating,This is my second time here and the sushi does not disappoint. The best sushi I have ever had and would highly recommend to anyone staying in the upper east side.
1880,nBkSqOhZMa1A7Yk3q8VPaA,10/16/2021,1 star rating,"The best thing about sushi is no doubt eating it. At Seki, one of the more popular sushi spots on the Upper East side, you don't have the opportunity to eat the sushi.Supposedly the uni and tuna are fresh, but we wouldn't know. Made a reservation here for 830, and waited almost 2 hours for our food. Really wish that this location lived up to the hype of the other locations, but ultimately, this place is full because they coast off of a 10+ year old reputation and take advantage of people willing to wait. Go elsewhere if you actually want your food to come, there are some great hotdog carts that give this place a run for its money because they actually give you your food."

We go for either rolls, classic sushi (nigiri) pieces of the more unique ones, all are great, and we keep coming back to Sushi Seki after trying other local joints.We usually try some of the none sushi dishes, but those are hit or miss in our opinion.The dinner sushi option ~$44 and the more special alternative ~$54 are both a great deal for the quality in my opnion."

I ordered delivery from their UES location and to say that we were disappointed is not to say anything. The rolls were tiny and tasteless, sushi pieces were also tiny and the fish used was from last year! Needless to say, the price was high which would've been fine if not such a disgusting quality.Stay away!"
1883,nBkSqOhZMa1A7Yk3q8VPaA,5/29/2022,5 star rating,One of our favorite New York sushi place. Omakase is simply awesome with creative sauces and combinations. Still deliver after all these years. We prefer the first Ave location over the time square one.

1885,nBkSqOhZMa1A7Yk3q8VPaA,11/1/2022,2 star rating,"Kind of average sushi.   Why is the fish pre-sliced?   It shows the place is not a high quality sushi restaurant.   Only customers who sit at the sushi counter and really know sushi will even know this.  Their mainly gaijin customers don't know any better, perhaps?    There are many high quality sushi places in the city.  For the money, I recommend other places"
1886,nBkSqOhZMa1A7Yk3q8VPaA,8/31/2019,2 star rating,"If (1) you don't audibly moan, (2) your eyes don't roll back in your head in pleasure or (3) you don't look at your dining companions with wide eyes and complete silence treasuring the glory of sweet sweet sushi during omakase... the restaurant is doing something wrong. Unfortunately, none of the above (or even close) occurred during our dinner here on a Friday night at 8PM. Had to knock down stars for (1) a completely inedible piece of fish (see below) and (2) the ridiculously high cost - ""I've never walked out of a sushi place and felt robbed. That was straight up robbery"". We paid $350 (pre-tip) for the worst omakase / sushi I've ever had. Frankly, I'd expect this kind of sushi from Penn Station or delivery from a place you vow to never order from ever again. I'm honestly shocked that Sushi Seki has a 4 star rating on Yelp/9.0 star on Infatuation. There are SO many better sushi places in this city; Sushi by Bou/Sushi by M/Sushi by Bae or any of the newer $50/10 piece omakases where the quality of the fish is literally 100x better than here for 1/3 of the cost. SETTING: very ""no frills"" sushi restaurant with a 12 seat sushi bar up front and two small tables, slightly bigger room for dining in the back. FOOD: the sushi here was not good. Yes, there were the few pieces that were OK quality cuts but overall I did not enjoy the omakase here for a lot of reasons. (1) some / majority of the sushi here was either super chewy, super bland or tasted just like sushi you'd get from any mediocre sushi spot (that doesn't cost an arm and a leg);(2) the timing of the pieces were off (like waiting 15 minutes for one piece then having three in a row put down in quick tandem with no break);(3) the various ""toppings"" used to garnish the fish (jalapeño sauce) really did NOT add to the fish (like the seared tomato + salmon piece I was looking forward to- try Tsushima in midtown east. THAT piece is worth writing about. The tomato here tasted burnt and funky / detracted from the salmon);There was a piece of clam served that was so chewy and tough to chew or swallow that I actually had to run to the bathroom to spit it out. It made me nauseous and spitting out my food? That has NEVER happened to me before, eating anything. Says a lot.SERVICE: disjointed. The omakase chefs behind the counter are intense to the point of being unfriendly and, two people are serving the entire 12 seat counter as well as the tables in the back. There were multiple moments of confusion where they're not sure of who's getting what, or the back is so busy you're sitting there waiting for your next piece after eating a pathetically small cut of horse mackarel/yellowtail/scallop (all not good).VERDICT: I really didn't want write this review in any vindictive way as I realize how hard it is to run a restaurant in the city and how bad reviews can deter customers. If you look at my other reviews I've never given 2 stars to a restaurant before and rarely give bad reviews. I'll always find ONE redeeming thing about a restaurant.But I really really just don't think it's okay for a restaurant to charge its patrons $350+ for such terrible quality sushi. I write this as a warning for other people who are just looking for a good omakase dinner- this is really not the place to spend your $$($$). Like.... we actually walked away from dinner pissed about how bad it was. Try Sushi by BOU instead and thank me later. Trust me."

One of us ordered the Sashimi special and was quite pleased. Two of us just ordered sushi and rolls a la carte.

Do not order here if you expect to be treated with dignity. Reading other reviews on here, sounds like this manager is a real trip as she's yelled at other customers in person at the diner...not just over the phone.I used to order from here in the past, this all ended when I called back to discuss an order that was cold, incorrect and leaking. When I called the ""manager"" I spoke with was condescending, rude and even sexist. The woman would barely let me finish to let her know the slight issues with the food and even praise the restaurant's service in the past. She called me ""nasty"" and yelled at me on the phone, refusing to help me further. I tried to speak with someone else because hey she may have been having a bad day, but she said there was no one else available. I found out later that she lied - her boss could have taken the time to speak with me. I don't think any customer deserves this mistreatment. A shame too, because they had the potential to be a great delivery go-to. Hopefully they will read this review and re-educate management so no customer has to be yelled at for the restaurant's mistakes. No one pays to be yelled at and eat a cold, incorrect and leaking order."

Why don't more places like this exist in Bushwick. Their bagels are also DECENT and we all know how hard it is to find decent bagels in this neighborhood sometimes. My usual order here is everything bagel with cucumber dill cream cheese and sometimes I dream about how good that cream cheese flavor is. There is also a printer in here that is very easy to use in a pinch. Definitely has come in handy a few times and usually costs me just a few bucks. Worth it for the convenience!"

Absolutely worth it & would highly recommend!!! Forgot about the custom cake pops! Beautifully done.

I'm a sucker for gingerbread type flavors, and this gingersnap hit the spot for my craving.Apple Cider - my friend thought this was a bit sweet for him, but this was the winner of the bunch to me. Tart and chewy - it's apple pie in the form of a cookie. There's a reason why the tray was empty when we ordered, and they had to pull one from another tray. Any time I'm in the area, I am 100% going to grab one of these regardless of what else I end up picking up.Each cookie was $3, but decently sized for easy sharing, absolutely worth a visit if you're in the area! Sadly, I neglected to take photos with exception of one sad afterthought of the apple cider cookie, we had already started devouring the cookies before I remembered."

A step below Luke's Lobster. The roll we received had a lobster mince, for a mix of other flavors instead of only lobster. The lobster roll comes on two pieces of Texas Toast, so it is practically two servings. Please note there may be supply chain and price fluctuation issues with lobster. Call ahead to see if they have it, and be understanding if they don't. - ""QBD Breakfast Special Burrito"": Very Good (4 of 5). Large and delicious, and more than enough to fill two people.- Reuben Sandwich (with 1/2 lb Pastrami): Very Good (4.5 of 5). $18.75. More compact than expected, but delicious and heavy enough for two people -- if you're willing to share. - ""Mango Tango"" smoothie: Very Good (4 of 5): although more citrus than mango in flavor. - ""Tropical Paradise"" juice: Very Good (4 of 5): thick for a blended juice.Other:- Online prices may be outdated. - QBD is currently take-out only during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Firstly I did want to arrive to this location before a certain time to avoid traffic and the possibility of not getting parking. I went about 11am and I got parking directly in front which was great! There was a few people in front of me however it gave me sometime to scan the menu and make a decision on what I wanted to eat along with my pressed juice. I was undecided since they have so much to choose from however I did choose a vegan meal! I ordered a VEGAN sausage, egg & cheese on an everything bagel. I did want to order the lobster, avocado Munster however I decided on this instead. I know huge difference, I did have an issue with the eggs as I believe they were not vegan usually it's a folded egg and the cheese did not appear to be vegan also I did call and was told for sure the sausage was vegan however there's nothing that could be done at that point so on my next visit I have to double check. This error for me is a big deal since Its not what I ordered I am a pescatarian getting away from cheese however this would have not worked for a VEGAN at all! Must be careful! For my pressed juice I ordered a Tropical fresh which was the fruity flavor out of all of the pressed juices. The others were more on the green side but mine was tasty!!!There were many Elite yelpers snapping photos and placing orders so I knew it would take a little while before I actually got my food. Which I was okay with after maybe 10 minutes my order was ready. As they were making my food they did call out for me to let me know they did not have anymore everything bagels bummer.. There was not many bagels to choose from so I chose a plain for me it was doughy, very thick the sandwich in itself was very bland."

I can't wait to be back to try more menu items. A lot of the popular items were already sold out when we got there a little after 1PM on a Sunday, but I'm not upset at all. Everything we got was exceptional. Mac & Cheese - 6/5 WOW. When I say I'm craving mac & cheese, this is exactly what I want. The large carton of creamy shell pasta with the lightly browned cheese on top was everything I imagined and more. Chicken Cordon Bleu Hero - 5/5 I wasn't feeling too crazy hungry so I got the half-sized portion. Let me tell you, even the half hero was a feast. It was absolutely loaded with flavorful ham and breaded chicken with a nice layer of cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and mayo. Yum.To top it all off, the staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. All around great vibes and great food for sure."

Asked for a ""Bagel All The Way"". They claimed they took it off the menu and proceeded to charge me for each item. Lox, Cream Cheese, Capers Onion and Tomato. Instead of $13.75 they ask for $16.75. Ok fine. As I'm paying the coupon doesn't show up on their system even though I have proof. Ok fine mistakes happen. Then as I walk away I see THIS.... Now you know."

The person told me that it's usually an extra charge but that they will honor it. And then I look in the bag and they gave me a muffin on the house - little acts of kindness like this goes a LONG way. Going to order breakfast from here moving forward because they clearly have amazing customer service and the food was very good

I thought I made reservations for me and my friend but I guess I didn't confirm (mistake on my end). It was a busy Friday night and the place was packed and bustling but the host still accommodated us and sat us right away at the bar. The ambiance is sooooo pretty, romantic, moody, and whimsical. Got us in the mood for some deep meaningful convos.. maybe got us a bit too emotional hehe The service was SO quick and they literally read my mind so many times, bringing napkins and water refills when I needed it. Everyone was so nice and friendly. They came around often to check on us without being overbearing. The food was AMAZING. We got the shrimp fried rice and bon Bo hue. The fried rice was probably the best fried rice I've ever had in my life... it tasted like a super moist pad-Thai flavored sticky rice. They don't skimp out on their seafood portions. The bon Bo hue was also sooo tangy and flavorful. The soup wasn't oily or heavy, just perfectly seasoned and light. No complaints whatsoever on the food! I wish I lived in NY, I would come back here alllll the time. The cocktails were to die for... seriously some of the best cocktails I've had. But a little too weak because we didn't feel very buzzed. (Or maybe we just have too high of a tolerance to alcohol haha) After our 4 day stay in NY, we agreed this meal at OBAO was the best meal we had in NY!"

What a disappointment it was here. The meat was not tender and the noodles barely had any flavor. We also tried the short ribs curry, and that was by far the winner. That dish had the meat falling off the bone and flavored to perfection. I also tried the pad Thai and it comes with shrimp, and that also had a generous amount of shrimp added to it. Other reviews talk about being rushed, but this was not the case with us. Our server didn't rush us, but didn't really check on us either. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and would be great for a night out."

1940,rYl_R-UILYqA6vYsbNwLsg,11/17/2022,4 star rating,Delicious food near times square. It's a popular spot that gets all the crowds so be sure to come early if you want to dine in or just call ahead for pick up which is what I did. We had to wait ~15mins even thought we had to call in but we | WHAT I TRIED | + Steamed dumplings (meh - would pass on this one next time. Serving size was small for what it was)+ Papaya Salad (pretty spicy here so be sure to get it a little more mild if you don't like spice)+ Pho Bo (solid but nothing too special) + Lobster Pad Thai (decadent and would get this one again. The lobster won't be good the next day so devour this Ifirst)+ Crab Fried Rice (Nice option if you want rice but would want the rice a little more flavored) ___________________Overall it's a solid spot if you're craving thai food. Portion sizes here are good for the price for what it is for the location. Space looks cool to dine in but didn't get to experience it this time around.
1941,rYl_R-UILYqA6vYsbNwLsg,2/2/2023,3 star rating,"3.5 stars The decor drives home the Thai & Vietnamese menu: Buddha statues, lanterns, & a wall-sized depiction of Thailand's majestic elephant. Upstairs, every square inch of the ceiling is littered with paper hearts dangling from bell-shaped fixtures. The music thumps loud, filling the crowded space with a vibe to behold. Obao is efficient at getting diners in & out without making us feel rushed. We were seated promptly & service was timely. We ordered:-- steamed dumplings ($10): filled with mushrooms, chicken, & shrimp. I loved the flavor of shitake which was prevalent but not overpowering. A little on the dry side but fine with the sesame oil & chili soy sauce pool at the bottom of the bowl. -- eggplant tofu w/ spicy garlic sauce ($17): though the eggplant was a bit plain, the fried tofu soaked up the sauce beautifully. -- shrimp tom yum soup ($10) & steak bun ($18): did not try; both middling, according to my companions. Family style sharing here is out of the question due to petite portions, however, the prices are such that trying a handful of dishes won't hurt your bottom line. I'd come back to see if their cashew chili chicken & drunken noodles can make a fan out of me."

Also serves other Asian fusion dishes as well. Exceptionally friendly staff with high speed service. Portions were filling as well. For appetizers, Kimchi Fries are a must have. Beautifully crispy fries drenched in Sriracha mayo, scallions and spicy pickled cabbage. Main course consisted of Pho Bo - flavorful broth and thinly sliced beef brisket. Pad See iew, sweet flat noodles with beef was delectable. Also ordered the Green Curry, however it wasn't as flavorful as the other dishes. Almost bland to the taste.Recommended Dishes: Kimchi Fries, Pho Bo, Pad See Iew"
1943,NN3mOWF5e_pnR1ArqM2bHQ,4/5/2021,4 star rating,"Today was a beautiful day in the city! It was about 67 degrees, extremely windy, partly cloudy, with sunshine coming in and out throughout the day. I was hungry and wanted some lunch. I had to take my dad to the city for a doctor's appointment (I got a parking ticket, but that's a story for another time). I thought I found great parking, but I misjudged my parking and the sign. Anywho...I spotted Beach Cafe as I was driving, and my windows were down, and I kept smelling this food on the grill and followed the smell to them. Their outside setup is nice and chill. The ambiance is excellent; I love the color of the settings as well. It's a real beach vibe but on the sidewalk. I went inside to use the bathroom. I can't tell how the inside looks, but it seems like a typical regular restaurant. I ordered the Original BeachBurger - circa 1966 with a side of French fries and a coke. The staff was very nice! I enjoyed the burger and fries. I don't usually order burgers, and lately, I have been diagnosed with TMJ (so it's hard for me to eat anything, especially things like burgers, tacos, crunchy stuff, etc.). The smell and the menu convinced me to get a burger. I got it medium well with cheese and bacon ($3 extra). It was very satisfying, and I must say I was impressed. They offer a wide range of cheeses to add to your burger. I got American cheese. I would suggest this restaurant! It's a nice vibe, especially with summer and warmer spring weather approaching. One thing I can say is the waiters or not always available, and you don't know who your waiter is, honestly. They need to work on that a little more. I witnessed one lady get out of her seat and said excuse me twice before she can get someone. I had three different people help me. After I got my food, that was it. By then, I was over it. I would've got dessert and another refill of coke. But because there wasn't any follow-up, it was a lost."

She said no, store policy. I said but you're going to give me two boxes regardless. Can you put one in one box and one in another and the rest in pasty bags? If not it would be two slices per box... But I just want one. ""sorry I can't do that"" I was so fed up with trying with her that i just took the pastries however which way she gave them to me. She got nasty with me because i was clearly upset and she started giving me attitude by sucking her teeth and slamming things.I finally told her off and thats when she put her tail between her legs. I was embarrassed for her employees. They all mouthed to me ""I'm so sorry."" You girls deserve so much better than her as a boss. I hope her staff goes to Martha'sAt Martha's they provide a box, one slice of cake, a candle and happy birthday sign. The slice is twice it's size and it's only a dollar and fifty cents more.I understand these things cost the business money. But if this makes your clients happy why not just give in?

It was inside a white bag am like wtf am have to it like 3 world countries just like my childhood not happy about that . So the reviewer didn't over react .

After leaving a competitor moments earlier Saturday afternoon with my bestie we sugar rushed to La Guli. $140 later we were very happy to share it with friends. While waiting for our assorted Italian cookies & pastries I ordered 2 large iced cappuccino to go. As they were finally placed on the counter, my friend held them up to me and made me look at them commenting how xtra light they were imitating a crime colored milk shake. Oh, no, not a ""Martha's""  horror story here too. We pointed out they were was too overly creamed and the taste of the coffee was definitely submerged & drowned in liquid. The young server politely took them back and added 2 more shots of hot fresh espresso coffee in the large cups. Now we were able to taste the cappuccino as it's supposed to be. Not an imitation starbucks Frappuccino version (an embarrassment of an excuse). Make sure if u ask for extra espresso shots to go whether hot or iced and especially iced with milk. Keep both eyes on that xtra milk isn't added. The ice cubes waters it down anyway. Ask for 2 standard hits of espresso in your large coffee to go. It seems milking it down is done everywhere these days. Either because the staff wasn't taught correctly (saves coffee for the establishment but it's price is still high retail) or today's millennials are clueless or don't pay attention as to what real coffee should taste like. Don't make me go behind the counter to show you. I've done that already on a dare by the manager of a Greek owned luncheonette across street from the hospital on 30th Avenue when his Greek frappe coffee maker wasn't in. I Jumped at the chance dare as it's in my veins and showed him in 12 seconds how it's done correctly.  But, not to divert, the LaGuli server rectified the 2 iced cappuccino issue immediately. Bravo Nono LaGuli.  A must visit! PS: the iced cappuccino shown were the b4. Should b much darker. Should've shot a corrected version to compare contrast. Trust me, it was fabulous!"

The next day I took the entire cake back to explain to the owner what happened. She was very rude with a terrible attitude and insisted that I was wrong and everything was fine. She lacks respect and customer service ethics. Each time I would try to speak I would get eye rolling, head shaking, speaking under her breath to a worker and was getting spoken to as if I was a child.

Onto entrees.  My friend got the heirloom tomato and corn salad which she absolutely loved.  It contained chimichurri, arugula, ciabatta croutons, sunflower seeds, tomatoes and corn topped with a nice portion of queso fresco.  I had the crunchy cauliflower tostada prepared al pastor style, which contained super delicious sweet pineapple, queso fresco, chickpeas, pickled onion, sour cream, salsa verde and cauliflower.  So very tasty.  Would order ten times over.  We were so happy to catch up and spend time together and we weren't rushed at all.  We probably sat for four hours.  I was delighted that it wasn't too busy and they allowed us all that time.  Service was impeccable."

The Bonnie punch was excellent and they definitely didn't skimp on the liquor. The beer list is pretty limited, not much out of the ordinary, they do have a beer made specifically for the bar but I found it quite watery. The wine list is pretty decent however and prices are pretty standard.

We ordered a turkey club on a bagel and it was amazing! We also ordered a bacon, egg and cheese on a roll and that was great. The hazelnut iced coffee was fresh and delicious. There is no doubt in my mind that Terrace Bagels is my favorite bagel place ever."

1976,rrsjcQVLg2PkIkO_vPjOLw,9/18/2021,2 star rating,"Most days this place is good. Today I ordered a sandwich without onions. Got home - it's pretty much an onion sandwich. Grill onions, too, so they had to make an effort to get it wrong. This place isn't cheap. The sandwich was $12 plus tip. For that price they should make more of an effort to get it right."
1977,rrsjcQVLg2PkIkO_vPjOLw,12/4/2021,1 star rating,"Years ago...this was the BEST bagel store ...possibly in most of Brooklyn!!! Unbelievable  now. No way the same. Downhill. So, maybe not the most popular  item in a bagel store, but STAY AWAY FROM THE EGGPLANT. I am a major eggplant fan...and was just in the mood. It was probably the WORST eggplant I have ever tasted. Tough and salty. Stick with a bagel and cream cheese. Play it safe.Even some of the wraps....eh...oh well. Too bad."
1978,rrsjcQVLg2PkIkO_vPjOLw,10/21/2020,3 star rating,"Ordering through DoorDash, this place used to be my go-to place for breakfast sandwiches. I say ""used to"" because, after my recent order, I may reconsider, and here's why.  The high prices were no surprise and never an issue due to the quality of the sandwiches. Recently I ordered the same Bacon, Egg, and Cheese sandwich with extra bacon. I may get a little fancy and add extras (life's short treat yourself).  I noticed that the option to add extras (e. g. lettuce, avocado, tomatoes, etc..) is no longer an option. I also noticed that they now charge almost $3 for extra bacon. When I received my sandwich (mind you, I paid the additional $3 for the bacon), it looked a little on the skinny side. To my surprise, there were only two strips of bacon on the sandwich. Seriously! A huge disappointment for a simple bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich that costs $10. Get it together guys. (I didn't even take a picture of the recent sandwich for comparison)."

Best bagels in the neighborhood and so much selection! Regular, whole wheat, mini, flat, etc. Delivery is usually really quick too. I still have never stepped inside the place (some day!) but I still kinda feel like a regular. They also have an extensive selection of pastries, sandwiches, and other breakfast goodies. I can vouch for the bagels, pancakes, and bfast sandwiches all being delicious. I plan to branch out and try their deli sandwiches and salads in the future bc I love supporting this local Brooklyn business."
1980,rrsjcQVLg2PkIkO_vPjOLw,12/17/2017,5 star rating,"This is a fantastic spot to get bagels for the office. They have a great mix of bagels and offer some rarer varieties like blueberry. Even if you get a bakers dozen there will still will be some bagels types you won't get. They also offer a good variety of cream cheeses with some rare selections as well (their blueberry cream cheese pairs well with their blueberry bagels.) The bagels here are quite chewy, large and airy. I think that both the qualities of the bagels and cream cheese are fantastic and you can get a lot of good combinations together. The prices are pretty good as well.As I said before this is a good place to hop in and get a dozen or so bagels for a special group occasion or office event. Its close to the G/F lines and the service hear is relatively quick. The place is pretty popular but the line you have to wait in goes by pretty fast.Overall this is a fantastic bagel place and I highly recommend coming here for quality bagels on your way into the city."

1982,rrsjcQVLg2PkIkO_vPjOLw,9/21/2017,3 star rating,"Terrace Bagels isn't your average bagel shop, it's more along the lines of a gourmet market that sells bagels. I dropped by looking for a couple bagels and cheese. As it was my first time here, I scoured the place and noticed how large the space was. It reminds me of the La Bagel Delight on 7th Avenue, but without the clutter, and unfortunately, not as good a bagel.I ordered a buttered bagel for my daughter, two everything bagels and some Swiss cheese. The whole time I was waiting for my order, I couldn't take my eyes off the cakes and pies near the register-- that Apple Crumb was really calling my name, I sadly opted to forgo the cake because I've missed the gym all week. The service was prompt, the location was large, had seating, various options, but the reason for the three star rating, is the bagels simply weren't good. They tasted like day olds from The Bagel Hole, no knock on the Bagel Hole, you know full well what you're buying when you get day olds. Except, in this instance, they were supposed to be fresh bagels. I will certainly come again for the apple crumb, and maybe try them earlier in the day for a re-do of their bagels. Hopefully I'll have a better experience next time."

This is a cake shop and nothing in here is for the diabetic. If anything it'll make you more likely to head that way.I didn't get the little rainbow cake but Rather some cake balls. The flavor of the peanut one is good but the others suffer the cake ball trap of being just too sugary without real true flavor. It's like eating a blondie without the delight of eating a blondie.Still actually coming to this store is super fun. It'll take at least 20 minutes to pose for all the instagram shots you'll take.

Actually stumbled upon this place after shopping at Glossier cosmetics. To my surprise, I would be finding an amazing sprinkle filled cake!We tried their mini version of the famous sprinkle spill cake ! It was fresh, moist, and of course wonderfully rainbow. The cake itself is still quite sweet, but the experience is really worth it! They also sell other items like cake balls that I enjoyed more over the cake cause its bite sized and easy to eat. Gonna crab a few more tomorrow and also try their cool cake rocket pop which is just the perfect portion of the sprinkle cake! Good service and great experience !"
1985,T-JA9h3BIZfFNvjwHAAj9Q,5/26/2019,1 star rating,"I admit that I went to Flour shop for the gram. I purchased rainbow cake push pop. It was pretty. I got pretty shots of cake push pop and the store decor to post on Instagram. That's all the positive things I can say about this place. Speaking of the taste, there's nothing special to talk about. The cake was bland with overly sweet cream and it wasn't as moist as it should be. Also, $8 is ridiculous for such a small piece of cake. The size of the cake push pop is not even half of standard cake slice. To sum up, this place is for 1 time experience. I will never return. There are so many pretty places that sell decent food/ dessert."

I decided to give it a try last weekend since I was in the area.We got a small sprinkle cake and a few cake balls to share. I actually liked the cake balls more than the cake. The sprinkle explosion when you cut the cake is a lot of fun, but the cake was a little too much on the sweet and sugary side for me. I'm also a frosting person and there wasn't a ton of frosting on the cake itself. The balls, though, were really moist and the perfect size.I have to say the prices were on the high side. The small cake we got was $40 and served about 3-4. This place gets points for cuteness though. Inside is very spacious and colorful, and the desserts themselves are adorable. There are a couple tables inside to enjoy your dessert, as well as a cute rainbow wall for photo opps."
1987,T-JA9h3BIZfFNvjwHAAj9Q,12/6/2018,3 star rating,"This place is cute (for one time) because the little cakes are very expensive. (The small cakes are $39). I get that little candies come out of them (imagine a piñata spilling its candies out- its like having the piñata inside the cake). Its adorable for taking pictures as the colors that are displayed all over are vibrant (many rainbows) and all of the tweens like it. I treated my friends to the cake and bought a coffee here too. Unfortunately, they do not have a restroom, so we had to go down the street and wait on line at Starbucks to use theirs. It is definitely a fun place to visit in NoHo."

The icing was amazing!I needed a last minute cake for my birthday trip to NY and this place was recommended. It was $150 for the cake to feed about 15-20 people and everyone loved it. The candy in the middle wasn't too sweet either, so definitely edible.The store itself is cute and great for pics."

The cakes and desserts were visually pleasing, especially seeing the rainbow cake filled with sprinkles that is all over the internet!  My son and I shared a push-pop which was basically a sampler of that pretty cake. It was good, but other than being really rainbow-y nothing in the flavor or texture was that special and it was definitely a bit pricey for a snack. Definitely still a worthwhile stop for a treat and to check out the rainbows!"

And, surprisingly, they've got the right recipe for cake, too. Their sprinkle cake, which explodes with more sprinkles & candy-coated chocolates, actually tastes good! Each layer of moist cake was lightly frosted with a cream cheese icing. No cupcakes here; only cake pops, cake push pops, & a couple different sizes of explosion cake which don't come cheap."
1992,T-JA9h3BIZfFNvjwHAAj9Q,12/9/2018,5 star rating,This place is worth the hype! Is it expensive? Yes but that is expected in NYC and for the quality of the deserts you are getting.

I've been eating their bagels for as long as I can remember.They seriously have the chewiest and freshest bagels ever! I've tried the fresh ones in the morning a couple times and nothing brings me more joy than a HOT bagel from JK Bakery! They are boiled to perfection. Also love how it is run by Koreans. Who knew Koreans can make some bomb bagels! Woohoo! Definitely have to come and give a visit. It's right next to H Mart too so you can buy some groceries while you're at it! Six stars."
2000,D2fCCyWufWiBTvrt3nMxHg,2/21/2017,5 star rating,"JK Bakery has the best bagels that I've had thus far. This isn't just your typical bagel shop. It's unique (in a good way). The bagel itself is soft and chewy. It's hard to explain, but you must try it and you can definitely tell the difference. It's good enough to eat the bagel itself. It will make your mouth water with each bite. As other bagel shops, they do offer a variety of bagels such as plain, onion, sesame and raisin. It's especially great if you go in the morning and get fresh/warm bagels right from the back.In terms of pricing, the bagel itself cost $1. Of course if you get cream cheese/etc, it does cost more. According to my last visit, I got a discount for buying in bulk. I got 20 bagels for $18. I brought bagels for a group and I did get complimented on the bagels. JK Bakery bagels don't disappoint."

I'd get a bagel and a yoohoo chocolate milk and it would be the highlight of my week. Now in my 30's and having in Maryland for most of my life, I still crave these bagels. It's amazing how she still remembers me  and how good the bagels still taste. My friend was in NYC for the weekend so I placed an order for 2 dozen bagels and he came back with like 5 dozen.  Thank you  =)LITERALLY THE BEST can't find bagels that even come close to this in Maryland."

True ny style bagels. Once you hear how the bagels are made, the price doesn't seem so bad. My very picky kid who doesn't really like bagels requests these from time to time so I'll pick up a few when I'm in the area. Free parking lot behind the store with ample space. Others here have said to get it while it's hot but I actually don't make it here in time for that and the bagels are still great!"

That said, I will not return as long as the bartender Alexis remains there. She's rude, obtuse, unprofessional and full of herself. She's also a thief, as she added drinks AND A TIP to my bill, which had to be voided by another staff member. Friends and I had a VERY difficult experience with her on 2/19/22, and I was most hopeful that the establishment would have dealt with her appropriately. Having frequented this spot well over 100 times over the years WITHOUT INCIDENT, my friends and I were most heartbroken over our dust-up with said bartender."

I would order online and then wait an extra TWENTY Minutes in the restaurant . Ordering at tables for food takes forever. I used to love the quality of the food, it was a GREAT hamburger. Tonight, the bun wasn't toasted, was soggy and fell apart. There was no lettuce just a plop of tomato and cheese. There were none of the signature crispy onions on top. It was a soggy depressing mess. Consistent quality of the dish, and of service are prerequisites to any decent restaurant. Sorry Midwood Flats. Your staff needs better training."

I order with the Bartender even though I was sitting outside. I ordered a margarita catfish tacos and a burger. The tacos Was sooooooooooo good. Nice and crispy. My friend said the burger was awesome. The reason I gave this place 4 star is because I wish they had more servers to improve on the service. The host was also the server for outside. But overall the food was great and the drinks was bomb. Looking forward to returning soon.

The restaurant/bar is pretty spacious, and they were pretty quick with their service both with the food and at the bar.The bar menu had a pretty substantial list of IPA's and craft beers, and had a solid set of cocktails as well. The food menu was pretty typical of a bar- sandwiches, burgers, and wings.The food was very good, and in terms of presentation, was pretty beautiful. The wings were served on a skillet, and the burger was packed, but in a way that didn't take away from the taste.The location is right off the subway line, and is definitely worth a trip if you're near prospect park and looking for a bite to eat."

When my family comes to visit this is where I insist to take them for dinner. Today I ordered grilled onions as part of my order and there was an onion with a clear ridged bite mark in the batch. I was so disgusted. At first I couldn't believe my eyes I thought maybe it was just a cut part of a onion, but no at closer look you see ridged teeth marks as though they used left over onions from someone's plate and regrilled it to put it in a delivery order. I called to let them know, not to even ask for a refund but to tell them what was going on so they would fix it. The manager got defensive,  and told me never to order from them again. Disgusting.  Don't worry I won't. If I owned this restaurant I'd get a new manager and fresh onions."

We each had one of the vegetarian stews, and they were okay but one was over-spiced and the other nothing special. The dessert was a very small portion.

2026,Ey45ZiAN1TSVmvfM6DVZqA,5/26/2018,1 star rating,Went last night (a Friday) and they were charging$5 cover to get in. It's not the money it's the principle. Who does that anymore? Especially in NY where the gay bar and club scene isn't what it used to be. I went in anyway. It was crowded and my $13 glass of ice with a splash of Belvedere and cranberry couldn't make it better. I was treated to watching a very drunk woman incessantly tongue kiss her pretending not to be gay boyfriend. Rather than watch that my attention turned to the 7 foot talk drag queen in chaps sitting bare-assed atop The serving bar. Yuck on all counts. I hurried to draw the last wisps of vodka out of the bottom of my glass ( hey at least they served it in a glass!) And I left. Won't be going back.

The clientele is friendly and good looking. The djs and performers are top notch. Drinks are cheap and they have some unusual drinks you won't find other places like the Arnold palmer pint.
2028,Ey45ZiAN1TSVmvfM6DVZqA,2/22/2019,1 star rating,"The vibe is a cool old school dark gay bar. the happy hour $8 well drinks are not that special.  But when you consider they water down the booze, then it's a rip off.  Young twinks who have no idea, don't really care, and then this will be a fun hangout.  But when I want a Manhattan, even with well whiskey, I don't want it watered down.  I had a remake of my drinks, and STILL it was watered down, even when made as a double.  Not only is this an insult, it's illegal.  Too bad, as it has a nice vibe."
2029,Ey45ZiAN1TSVmvfM6DVZqA,9/1/2018,2 star rating,Went to Rebar last night and with 20 minutes of arriving the music and lighting stopped working. They had it back up and running for a couple minutes until it turned off again. The reason this is a bad review is because upon walking out I asked the doorman to return my cover and he refused. You can't charge people cover for a party that you then can't execute.

I asked the bartender why he had not informed me of that before I ordered drinks. He replied he was instructed not to tell me until he poured my drink, and also that his only job was to pour the drinks I asked him to pour... but directed me to the ATM to pull out cash there. He then said if you want to get cash that's fine, but if I didn't want to that was okay too.... wtf? He saw a card in my hand before I even ordered drinks. We peaced and won't be back. You suck, guys. Bye Rebar!"

As much as I loved G Lounge (the bar at this location before Rebar) and have many amazing memories, they were doing a horrible job at using the space and it looked pretty outdated. This place is great. They have good music and although it can get super crowded, there's enough space to dance."

They have the newspaper and a cute library of children's books to borrow and read while visiting. Blue Sky is a charming and special place with the best muffins in NYC.

I just had a strawberry blackberry muffin that was packed full of fruity flavor without being overly sweet. The chocolate croissant was a hit with my fiancé too. Can't wait to come back and try more muffins soon -- it's dangerous to live so close to this place."

Because then you can't see it, and the comparison becomes dumb.I finally went in here after missing their closing time 2-3 times on earlier food tours. I got a Blueberry Muffin because they remembered it. It was probably a 4-star muffin (i.e. very average, since I rate family owned places 3, 4 or 5 only), but because of all the hype and the fact that I was expecting the muffin from heaven to change my life forever, I'll keep it as a three. It was just a very average muffin that did nothing for me. In fact I may like the ones at Wegmans up in Buffalo better. Damn. That's cold.And if you sleep with a member of the Blue Man Group or Rebecca Romijn from X-Men, then you might hear a ""Blue Sigh."" If you're any good."

I bought the zucchini muffin with dark chocolate and raspberries. It's a hefty size and not skimpy with the dark chocolate and raspberries. I can argue that my muffin was still warm on the insides after my 10 minute walk back to my apartment. (yum)It's crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, aka muffin perfection. I'll be back, but to stay a little longer :) P.S. CASH ONLY"

If you're looking for a pretty hip place that still has the small business vibe, this is the place to be! The pastries here goes fast on a busy day and they pass them all out before it gets too far into the afternoon. The muffin I had was a bit on the drier side, but it was still extremely delicious. I suspect the dryness was from the fact that I wandered in late in the day, so I'll have to pop in early for a fresh treat! Prices are reasonable and I definitely need to explore this menu."

The combinations of flavors are fantastic - such as pumpkin apple walnut, or carrot coconut mango to name a couple. The store hours are short and they do run out, and their locations are not nearby, so I'm glad the bagel shop down the street from my home carries these muffins even if the price is almost double."

Note these wings aren't the hormone filled ones that are ginormous lol, so if you're really hungry i'd get the next size up order. it hit the spot for me, but i'll definitely be hungry again soon haaa. The taste was good, also note their mango habanero isn't anywhere near as hot as buffalo wild wings, so go for it, sweet heat was also mild to me.

I was expected to get my delivery at 6 PM but didn't get a delivery until 8 PM. The staff at the store as well as the delivery driver himself were very rude. Here's the turning point of the review though, the food was absolutely amazing. I got several different types of wings as well as tacos and I was completely blown away by everything that I got. I rated it so low because the service is really horrible and it seems as if there is no accountability at any level to make complaints or express your dissatisfaction. It must be family owned and operated, because my complaints fell on deaf ears"

Food took over an hour after I was told 20-25min. After 45 minutes I was informed they were out of one of the items I ordered which should have been communicated in the beginning. If they want to have a good business they should open up their own restaurant or take out spot, not run it out of an unruly bar."

2055,TM6JJwxRoZ9YXlp9MyGuIw,10/5/2021,2 star rating,"We have been ordering from Bagel Cafe for years. They have a large selection/assortment of options for both breakfast and lunch & everything is fresh and high quality. Depending on the time of day we will place an order for delivery or pick up. We've never had an issue with either. It's always prompt and the order accurate (we're never really ordering anything that's heavily modified.) Today we called and were forced to order through grub hub for whatever reason. It took twenty minutes to even place the order with the operator and she asked us the same three questions over and over again because she kept taking it improperly. After reading the order back to us multiple times she asks us for a form of payment and tells us we cannot pay cash. Which I understand for security reasons. However we have always paid cash in the past and it was never an issue. If that is now the policy she should have told us upfront before we invest 20 minutes even getting the order taken. We give her all of our information and pay via credit card over the phone. An hour later we still haven't received our food after only being quoted 30-45 minutes. We call back and another operator FIRST asks if we just want to cancel the order (to which we responded that we still want the food we've been waiting an hour + for) she then puts us on hold to reach out to the restaurant. She informs us it will only be another five minutes before it's here. An hour and thirty minutes goes by in total and we receive the food and one of three of the items is completely wrong. We love the bagels here, so I'm sure I will continue to come in and wait in line to order them but we certainly won't be ordering here as frequently as we use to. It shouldn't be this difficult to give local businesses your $ but with all of them taking on grub hub and seamless out of convenience, they will surely be making it difficult for you."

Right now I have no breakfast and I'm out of almost $60.  Never again will I order from them and I'm contacting the BBB to look into this. Very unsatisfied.

Don't get me wrong the food quality is good, but be ready to pay for it. I've never had a breakfast here that wasn't practically 10 dollars. A sausage egg and cheese on a croissant is like 8 dollars and today I bought a grilled cheese with bacon that cost me almost 9 dollars!!!!!! for a grilled cheese!!!!!!! Extremely overpriced."

We got the wrong order and called to tell them hoping they would politely fix their mistake she demanded that she was right and would not fix her mistake.

This place may be known for superb bubble tea, but the food was so incredibly lackluster, yawn-worthy, and uninspiring. I got seafood ramen and could don't have been more disappointed. 1) The egg was so hard-boiled it was grey, 2) the greens and carrots were a poor choice since both hold up really well to hot broth, so neither wilted/cooked and elevated the dish or melded into the ramen experience. The seafood: how do you cut up some imitation crab meat and throw into a bowl with some boiled shrimp. Do something, anything, to make this meal less sad and pathetic. Did I mention that I had to navigate my way though this dull ramen soup with just a plastic fork, since that's what I was provided rather than a spoon and chopsticks? Never getting food there again. Maybe just their bubble tea for me."

I think their drinks are all pretty standard in terms of consistency and decent balance of tea/sweetness. They have a good menu of nomming foods, so I tried the fries out of curiosity. It took a while for them to get the fries to me, and they were kind of bland. I've had good fries from another ViVi chain before, so I was kind of disappointed how plain they were. They were oversalted, and they didn't have much flavor. A little sad that there wasn't more to it! I kept thinking that I should have just gotten the crispy chicken because that's what Taiwanese PMT places are known for. Sads!"

There is a good amount of seating and although the staff can be slow with food orders, they get the drinks just right. I do however propose the team gets a bit more organized or an addition of one more staff as during lunch hours and other rush hours, they tend to scramble and have trouble keeping up. They are friendly otherwise and I just make sure I have enough extra time to wait when I order the basil popcorn chicken (my favorite snack!)."

It doesn't give off the most ""clean"" vibe, but it isn't, by any means, visibly dirty. In fact, all the tables were perfectly clean and a guy actually came around to throw away our trash (impressive).Bathroom: didn't use it (if there is one...)Staff: Everyone was pretty straight business but the guy who cleaned up our trash (not sure if he was going out of his way or they always do this) was very nice.Food: We all had the shawarma + salad bar and it was pretty solid. The sauces they had were pretty tasty as well. They seem to have a pretty extensive menu so I wonder what the other food is like...Value: You pay, and get a level of service, about what you would expect.It's definitely something different and will now be considered when thinking of where to grab lunch."

Side note: Coolest motto in midtown? ""Make your food kosher...but keep it deluxe."" That's just pure fire right there. Pure. Fire.When you order make sure to get the platter. They hand you a little plastic container and you can fill it till it's bulging open with whatever veggies you want. They have the usual Middle Eastern standards - pickles, carrots, peppers, cabbage, etc. Everything's pretty awesome so don't be afraid to pack it in there. If there's any air, you're going to be disappointed.It comes out to like 12 buck so not the cheapest thing in the world but you will be FULL! Come hungry or bring a friend.

The problem with that system is that NO ONE was taking orders for people who want to pay cash. I stood there for 10 minutes and I suppose the workers thought I was standing there for my health, because they kept walking right past me. I had to flag one of them down and ask for my order to be taken, which is absolutely ridiculous. Believe it or not, some people still pay with cash.I finally got my food, and looked for a table.

I made them aware of what I saw. The guy threw out the donuts but didn't move the raw chicken. Makes me wonder what goes on in the back that the customers don't see.

An hour goes by and nothing. My bf calls them because he wanted his money back for the waffle that didn't get eaten and the manager REFUSED to even speak with him over the phone and then refused to give us our money back but wanted to send us syrup over an hour later. Not even a new waffle but just syrup for a cold freakin waffle. Never ordering from them again. Overpriced trash food and trash service. Don't bother."

I understand there are rules and the area is known for its unsavory pedestrians, but if a customer buys from your business regularly you can bend the rules just a bit. I ended up sprinting to the Chinese spot where they allowed me to use the restroom, and yes I did buy from them. Word of advice, don't treat your regulars like common bums.

That in itself doesn't seem to be too bad, considering the good service + nice decor of the place. But I'm not sure the prices are justified. The beef Pho is tasty, with a decent amount of beef. It is filled with cilantro, so if you don't like that, tell them! The pad see ew on the other hand, being as expensive as it was, was a letdown. I was expecting something innovative and super tasty, but it was all right. The pieces of shrimps are more like prawns, which is great, but I just didn't think I made the best of choices as far as entrees are concerned."

Luckily, they had electric heaters for us. I liked that it wasn't too crowded. I think there was only one other couple who was eating outside a few tables down from us. The spring rolls were tasty, the salmon curry was good on the jasmine rice and the pork dish was interesting. I'm not sure that it was one of the places I would go out of my way to come back to because there are so many good places to choose from in NYC, but I'm very glad that we ate here."

Got the pork spring rolls and curry noodles. Loved the spring roll platter as I'm a sucker for anything crunchy and lettuce-wrapped. I was expecting the noodles in the curry soup to be long and thin, not short and flat. Flavors were ok to me, and portions seemed small for the steep price. Servers were nice, but service was so slow. Waited over 10 minutes to order, and even longer does the food to come out. Couple next to us were trying to wave over a server half the time we were there.Overall, great Laotian food experience but won't be back soon"

With Chef Phet being a friend of a member of our party, he came out from the kitchen to greet our table and asked if he could pick all of our food for the evening. And he delivered. I've never seen so much food for one table in my entire life. Every time I thought to myself that I couldn't eat anymore, three new dishes would arrive at our table. All I could do was shake my head and laugh and then dig in.There was so much food, I can't even recall everything that I ate! It seemed like he sent out the entire menu, and I'm not kidding. But here are my favorites:Pork Spring Rolls - crispy spring rolls, wrapped in lettuce leaves and dipped in a delicious peanut sauce.Crispy Duck Leg - Duck is always a risky thing to order. It's either spectacular or it's chewy and dry and a huge letdown. Chef Phet knocked it out of the park. It was perfectly cooked with so much flavor.Crispy Pork Belly Wrap - Sweet and spicy and c'mon. You can never go wrong with pork belly.Pork Curry Noodle. - My absolute favorite of the entire night. It was great to end our evening on such a high, even though by that point, I had food up to my eyeballs.  And it was a huge bowl. But it smelled heavenly even after the whirlwind dinner we'd just experienced.Chef periodically came out from the kitchen to give us tips. Like ""Try the sauce from this entree and pair it with pork belly from that one."" These tips elevated the entire experience. Thank you, Chef Phet. You gave me a night I will never forget."

However, our party of 5 was still relatively Covid cautious at the time and decided to forgo family style even though the menu seemed built for that. Each of us decided to forgo the big plates since they were on the pricier side. Amongst the small plates, most consisted of a protein with some veggies. I ordered the Berkshire Pork Spring Rolls, a favorite of mine whenever I go to Viet places. They were delicious spring rolls, and surprisingly filling when eaten with the carrot sauce drench vermicelli, lettuce, and bean sprouts. I also sampled my friend's BBQ quail, which had an inviting smoky honey flavor, but was a little dry for my liking.Although Khe-Yo didn't stand out to me too much, I suspect I would have enjoyed it more if I had sampled a few of their dishes."

The worse and to me, what really hit to the lowest, is, When I asked the owner (that stands by the register all day as to say, ""I don't trust my employees"") if he could please donate a dozen bagels to the program I work for through the DOE for a holiday ""on the go breakfast"") I am a long term substitute teacher, working at a program for student-parents that are in school continuing their education in order to receive their diploma.) I told him I would purchase everything else. He told me ""no."" I WAS a regular costumer. I gave him the information about the program to look up on line. Com'on! I was asking for a dozen bagels to be donated!!! Even if he had handed me the day old bag he sells for a $1.00 would have been sweet. I will not step foot in there again! I'm so disgusted!

It's the whole experience. I need to walk up to a window or a tiny shop that can fit two people. I shouldn't spend more than $5. And the pizza should be larger than my face! Kiss My Slice offered all those options a block from my hotel so we picked it up on the way back.My sister ordered a meat lover's while I had a supreme. The pizza is already prepared and they heat it up in an old school oven, a la Michael Scott's favorite pizzeria Sbarro. ;) They have a small counter to cover your slice of pie with the all important fixings (red pepper flakes, parm, etc.). The service was fast and the two slices were under my $5 price range. We quickly walked back to the hotel to enjoy our slices.The crust is thicker than a typical New York slice, but it made sense since these two pizzas were COVERED in toppings. There was a very impressive of meat and veggies for $2/piece. They were both very delicious and I was quite sad when it was gone, even though one slice is certainly enough for a meal!If I were in the area I'd definitely be down to kiss another slice - I guarantee you my pocketbook feels the same way."

Our pizza choices were quickly cooked and given to us. Prices were fair, and we took them to their little stand-up counter facing the window where we could people-watch, enjoy the warmth, and our pizza! Pizza is sold by the slice. I don't remember if credit cards are accepted, but it's a good idea to carry some cash on you when shopping around in NYC. Parmesan Cheese, Oregano, and Garlic powder are available to add to your slices. It was a tasty enjoyable experience and I would come back for more!"

A great deal for under $25 to feed our family--4 slices of pizza, one order of (4) garlic knits and a bottle of soda ($2). H and I both got a slice of the white pizza with spinach which tasted pretty good. Nothing fancy. Hubby got a slice each of pepperoni and supreme Little O got a cheese slice. All slices were large pizza slices and was just the right amount for a lazy day dinner in the hotel room.

Still don't get the hype over NY pizza. That being said the prices we're a little more reasonable than other stops like Joe's at about $26 for a whole specialty pie vs $33 at Joe's. Still not great (or reasonable) in my mind but much easier to swallow. They also do a nice deal where you can get two cheese slices and a can of soda for $5.50.I still give it four stars because the staff is super friendly and helpful and was nice enough to pack up utensils, napkins, and plates without me even asking.

I've ordered an egg roll twice  from them in the past and enjoyed it. Today while eating the egg roll a shrimp dropped out. I'm allergic to seafood and was very fearful. I went back to Lichee Nut and told the man at the front desk what happened he said  "" The egg roll has shrimp in it."" I asked to see the menu that says this. He said"" it doesn't say, for 40 years sometimes we mix with shrimp and sometimes we don't. Are you allergic to shrimp."" I said yes. He said ""then you need to be more careful next time"".I could've lost my life and his unprofessional behavior added to my frustration. Never Again will I eat from this restaurant."
2144,3Sm7_Nhnj12r5RhianvrbQ,12/22/2017,3 star rating,"This review is only for their takeout service. The prices are slightly more expensive compared to other take out Chinese spots. However, the food is solid and their service is great. The food always arrives early and they have never made a mistake on any of our orders. I love how paper plates, forks, napkins, and sauces are always provided for us in little zip lock bags- ensuring that sauce from the foods will not spill on any utensils. I would say this is probably one of the best Chinese take out options if you live around the area and are looking to order for delivery.Chicken lo mein- Pretty standard. Not overly greasy like some of the other dishes. I would recommend ordering this.Spring roll- Delicious and fried perfectly. The outer layer has the texture of  spring roll, but the inside filling is like an egg roll. Pretty interesting. Scallion Pancake- I would not recommend ordering this. The scallion pancake was too doughy. Tip: never order scallion pancake for take out, it needs to be eaten fresh.Minced Chicken Corn Soup- A must try! I order this every time! Beef with mushrooms- Delicious, their beef is tender and not tough at all. However, the sauce is very greasy.White rice- The rice here is not that good... It's too hard. As with most take out spots, the sauce can be very greasy! If you are health conscious, then I would say: steer clear. However, if you appreciate well fried crispy spring rolls and saucy food, this place has pretty solid take out."

When you're starving, the last thing you want to do is dine in and wait for your order. Surprisingly, our appetizers and entrees were delivered relatively quickly. I had the white rice with broccoli in garlic sauce alongside a side order of wings. Delicious! I'm all for great wait service, but it's a little difficult to enjoy the meal and ambiance when the staff is standing near the opposite wall and staring at you. It's okay to periodically glance over, but staring intently is a major no-no. My glass of water will not magically vanish, prompting a refill anytime soon so please feel free to tend to other diners or employee area.I always feel more at ease whenever I can glance over and watch the employees dine in on their break. It is great insight into the work culture and quality of the food."

We always choose the cold sesame noodles, General Tso's Chicken, and the pork fried dumplings. We always love it! One tip, and this seems to be more so lately, the General Tso's isn't that spicy. Best to spice it up a bit if you like it that way. We have also enjoyed the moo shoo pork and scallion pancakes.Recommend!"

Only in a Chinese place in Brooklyn Heights, if you get my drift! What we ordered:- Shrimp with broccoli price $14.95 - the shrimp was horrendous, it tasted like rubber. However, their special brown sauce was good and the broccoli was cooked well. - General Tao's chicken $13.95 - this was shockingly good! It was crispy, juicy, and coated in sticky sweet sauce - everything General Tao's should be!- Roast pork lo mein $9 - this was a pretty solid dish."

It's just really good! And every now and again when I'm in the neighborhood, this is where a stop by when I'm in need of a little grub.The flan is good too.

Sometimes they wouldn't even cut the bagels, or cheese sandwich. There hot chocolate is really really really really good!! I love it they don't use water , they use boiled milk. Just tell them to mix it for you. Basically this place you have to tell them what you want. They are usually friendly besides one person besides that this place is good.

I bought a few home ($2.25 each) and toasted it a little, and I devoured it immediately. I'm so glad I ate it at home because my carnage was not a pretty site. The guava paste was not too sweet, and the cheese was not too ""cheesey"". The pastry it self was flakey and perfect too."

Living in the LES for roughly 6 years allowed my SDB bond to really blossom. I can only imagine how things would have been better had I been able to habla espanol. Even with my pathetic attempts to win over the staff with my broken Spanglish I was never let down by tasty breakfast treats. I highly recommend the arepas con chorizo, arepas con queso, and the wildly popular arepas con huevos y queso. All for under $4.

Well, it's golden ""bun"" so I gotta order some bao. Their bao were good to enjoy but sometimes it's not that warm to enjoy even though they told me that they steamed it again. First time I had the lotus paste and 2nd time I ordered the pork bun. Pork bun was.. ""meh"".. but the lotus bun was pretty good.I like the lady that works there.

That meant fast service, but little room to move. The seating here is very limited and was hogged up by the workers, so I wasn't able to sit and eat. I really like how they sell mini buns by 3s. This makes it easy for me to try something new with friends. I only purchased the egg tarts during this visit and was very unsatisfied because it lacked the authentic egg tart consistency and flavor. The custard was too solid and the crust was not flaky at all. Because I frequent this neighborhood often, I will probably be back to try their other foods and update this review then."

I've had Loukoumi Taverna bookmarked for quite a while because of their high reviews so my friends and I decided to finally go. The restaurant was packed, every table taken + a large party of more then ten people with ONE waiter. The waiter was definitely overwhelmed at some points of the night. Apps: Tzatziki with pita (the pita was burnt) Fried Calamari (total of like 10 pieces) Greek Salad (small) Overall take: the app portions are very small. The Greek Salad didn't have much flavor that i had to add more oil and red wine vinegar. Entree: Grilled shrimp Lamb chops (on the small side)Shrimp in garlic sauceFor the sides, we ordered french fries and lemon potatoes. They messed up my order and brought me green peas instead. And the lemon potato was literally one potato cut in half. Insane!Was the food bad? No. Would I go back? No. But I can honestly say I left a bit unsatisfied.

I was in desperate need of coffee, so this place seemed promising--yet I ended up disappointed. The service was pretty awful, continued to forget my order and was chatting up a storm with a friend. My order ended up to be much smaller than what I expected, a tiny cup of an Americano, for nearly $4...little steep if you ask me...and then ended up tasting not that great. I was disappointed mainly because this place really has so much potential. They seem to have a really cool wine and beer selection, a long with a lot of other great coffee drinks.

We had brunch a few hours before so *maybe* my taste buds were coated with other flavors, but the coffee here tasted like potato water to me. I had a $3 drip coffee and I couldn't taste or think of anything other than potato water. Imagine boiling potatoes and drinking the leftover water. That's what I tasted.

The service is not friendly either.  The back patio is a nice green space to sit down outside and meet people but that's pretty much it.

This place is very cramped so get takeout. It has several kinds of pizza. Most popular of course is the New York style. The pizza is sold by the slice for about $2.75, which isn't terrible. It also has calzones. These are about $12 so kind of high. Offerings here are pretty average. This is not the best, but it's not the worst Wish I knew what Antoinette L. had here. She mentioned how good the vegan pizza was, but the owner said they never had any. Too bad, there's always Two Boots Pizza."

Leaving the station of subways there it was, not knowing what i was about to get myself into i said ""ahh whatever imma just eat there"" and man when i tell you i made the right decision we'll i'll be damned. After taking my first bite i was walking around the city of new york feeling like an Italian mobster, almost like if you looked at me funny i'd slit your throat. It was so good i wanted to go back in there and kiss uncle vinnie himself and join the family. I came all the way from sunny san diego and trust me im going back to NYC just to see uncle vinnie.

But I wouldn't choose to have this pizza sober, there are so many other pizza options in the city. They have a variety of menu items including pizza, salad, calzones, and I only tried the pizza so I shouldn't rule out the other menu items I didn't try.  The shop is very small, with only a few number of seats available.

Now when I emerge from the underground, I see Vinnie's Pizza staring me in the face. I grabbed two plain trial slices last week after work, and it was pretty lackluster. Not fresh, reheated, nothing special. They need more volume in order to be a good slice joint.However, I was intrigued enough to order a whole fresh pie this past Friday night. Now this was good. Freshly prepared, the good quality ingredients started to make their presence known, and I could appreciate the abundance of smooth sweet tomato sauce, and nice thin crust. I'll definitely order from here again."
2192,7E_aRWK6sx_jKm2LNmxpkQ,8/27/2017,3 star rating,"Stopped in here cause I needed a cheap lunch special for lunch. (!) WHAT I GOT: $5 lunch special ($5.50 with tax) which includes 2 plain slices and a canned soda. (!) HOW IT DID: It was alright. It was far from the best pizza I've ever had, Crust was very plain and it was... y'know, just fine. Standout of the pizza was the tomato sauce. All in all, it was $5.50 that I didn't regret spending. I'm willing to bet that if I had arrived when the pizza was freshly made, maybe it would've been fresher & better. But it was about 3:30pm and the slices I got were put into the oven to be reheated. (!) SEATING: Minimal seating. You're probably better of taking it back to work or back home.(!) SERVICE & AMBIANCE: I'm not looking for a long lasting foodie relationship with these guys, and I like it. They ask what I want and I let 'em know. They take my card and ring it up. They slid the pizza box over. This place shines on ambiance and it felt like an old-school shop--though word in the reviews is they opened up a month ago!(!) TIDBITS: $5 minimum credit card charge. There's an ATM in the shop too in case you need cash for a slice... though I don't see why people would use it if the minimum is so low. Lunch special goes until 5:00PM, which is great.Overall, if I need a cheap meal for work, this place is up for consideration if I'm not trying to walk too far and if I'm eating a late lunch. I think I'll be back, if only to see if the pizza will be better next time."

Not in rage at us but just because she was a mess.- Took a few minutes to remember she had to get us new drinks.- Poorly made drink. (Went with beer and shots the rest of the night)- She threw the Halloween candy we were eating on the floor.- Some guy called her a bitch as he left and she hopped over the bar and attempted to ""fight"" him.- She kept coming over and said ""I'm sorry I'm so drunk, can I get you guys anything?"" as if it was free.

Highlights of the bar: Free darts, $3 happy hour from 5pm-7pm, $1 air hockey table in the back, a friendly mascot to play fetch with, and a pool table for those who are the drinking/gaming type (although the table is somewhat falling apart and needs re-leveled very badly due to a slight lean on one side, but it's the only pool table in a 6 block span, so who cares). Downsides of the bar: Not an extremely large selection of drafts. They have about 7 or 8 taps, but luckily, they are all good beers and not your typical Bud-Light dive-bar scenario drafts. Overall, it's just a great, low key, relaxed place to hang out and have drinks. I always spend less than $20 every time I go, and I'm always satisfied by the overall enjoyable quality of the experience."

2197,jXcc7Ofp5b5Xwa3-NZc9Sw,8/4/2017,5 star rating,"I love this bar!!! What more could you want? The best 90s play list that sings to my very soul and an array of arcade games that sing the song of my adolescence. Best gin & tonics. Great bartender and great company! Seriously I'm having the time of life playing Ms. Pacman and air hockey. Spending the night jamming out to Weezer, STP, Bush, Smashing Pumpkins, and other great bands from from the 90s. This place is a gem. If you live in South Slope hit this place up!! Although I do like that there's only a handful of people here now. Sad that I'm moving a little further north but this place is worth a trip down to Brooklyn! This is what bars should be. End. Of. Discussion."
2198,jXcc7Ofp5b5Xwa3-NZc9Sw,2/26/2015,4 star rating,"Great little corner bar for those who like bars that look and act like bars. If you're looking for a handlebar-moustache twirling mixologist to assemble an artisanal cocktail this might not be the place for you. If you're into friendly bartenders, a warm and social crowd, nice low lighting, a pool table where I've had pick-up matches with strangers, honest beers and whiskies than this is most certainly the place for you! This is a really nice spot that deserves a shot.*If you're angry or loud in a bad way steer clear! If you're nice and only get a bit loud when you're having a good time bring it on in, pull up a stool, talk to the stranger next to you, and tip your bartender. I guarantee you'll walk out of there feeling even better than when you walked in."

I dunno."

It's changed drastically over the years. It's still a watering hole but the greatest dive to have a chat with the neighbors, play a game of pool, order a pint or well drink for $3 until 9pm. They also have a decent selection for a dive: Shiner Bock, Sweet Action, Kelso, Stella, Guinness. Go crazy. Wells from what I remember were super strong but it depends on your bartender. They also used to come in much bigger glasses. A few months ago they nose-dived to a C-rating and one of my friends refused to go inside when wandering the neighborhood. But this past weekend. . . .hoo hoo hoo, someone jacked that up to an A! Its my lucky day! I went inside and noticed the ski ball was gone. Frowny face. But they still have Big Buck, Ms. PacMan, and that pool table. The jukebox has a fantastic selection. I love Buttermilk. Not just strongly like. LOVE. It's barely noticeable when walking by because they don't have a flashy sign or any decor on the outside but inside its strangely warm and welcoming. I also made friends with a very enthusiastic Corgi pup that night."

The Maze is located on the 3rd floor up a steep flight of stairs, there's also an elevator so that wasn't really a problem. The floors were a bit sticky and the appetizer we ordered (jalepeno cheese bites) was mediocre.Drinks were good though prices were steep. However, I did enjoy the vibe as there was lively conversation, light music playing, and decent privacy at the tables: there was a screen that separated our table from the main walkway area. Service was great as our waiter came to check on us multiple times."

However, the drinks are truly New York expensive and placed in deceptive glasses with wayyyy too much ice. Please add more NA (non-alcoholic) drink options please. **Food 5/5: I enjoyed the food here. So much so I came back by myself the very next day and order the same thing (* pork belly meal & rice)  again. The chicken wings are legit and by 13 pcs yes it's a real 13, not the baby shower party wings (iykyk). AT AN ALRIGHT PRICE TOOO. Drinks 2.5/5: I'm not a drinker but work had me y'all. I order a lychee mojito and that skinny tall hourglass - glass (literally) with sooo much ice was $16. I took three sips and I'm done. To be realistic probably 5, and that was probably to get the water from melting ice. But the virgin lychee mojito. Mad ice but less than the one with liquor ......?¿...  but that's nyc I guess. But not for me, won't do that anymore.Service 4/5: seated promptly and given a menu. The server assistants are helpful in bringing water and if ready to order right away they'll typically always be around. The actual servers, when I did see them very nice. Came to follow-up and confirm an order, saw them to drop a check too. Very standard service practices and I appreciate them.  Jun, Rodrigo, the other nice server with the baby ponytail, very nice. Overall, would visit again. My preferred spot for a late night eat."

This was no different. The atmosphere is so instagrammable, beautiful decor everywhere. We were seated right away and within an hour the place was packed! The food is full of flavor. There was four of us and this was plentiful for us. If the fries are good you know everything else will be too. At least I judge based off fries lol now I'm not a kimchi lover but put them on some fries with cheese and I'm in!! The wings were exactly sweet and spicy, crispy and juicy. Both noodle dishes were exquisite, chefs kiss! My only complaint would be the service is a bit slow. We ordered and then a second person came and took our order again. It eventually got to us and it was amazing!"

We ordered a few bottles of soju that unfortunately we weren't a fan of (mainly because of the flavors we chose). We ordered a ton of food and it came out very quickly. We ordered the kimch-eese fries (amazing), sweet & spicy popcorn chicken (also amazing), the maze crispy sampler (decent), bulgolgi (really really good as you'd guess), sweet and sour chicken (great), anda  few other things I dont remember. Our group demolished all the food and were in and out in about 1.5 hours. It was a really good meal and an overall cool spot. The bar was really cool as well."

Be prepared to wait a bit to get a spot at the bar Drinks: We got the Maze Collins -- they offer two flavors: Mango and Lavender. Both very good, a little too sweet for my taste but refreshing. A little light on the alcohol which can be good or bad depending on your preference. Misc: Floors are sticky, there's only one bartender assigned to the bar (seemed like the other bartender was more focused on drinks for tables), generally a crowd builds up very fast with no good crowd control. Sort of a disorganized chaos with waiters walking around the crowd just trying to get people's orders to their table."

Be sure to bring your ID because they do check before you come in. The staff is nice if not a little overwhelmed at times. The soju is well-priced, and the food is good! I really loved the potato Korean pancakes. I think they are super tasty, and I LOVE the sauce they come with. I also really like the jalapeno poppers and the crispy calamari."

The first time we stopped in, we were walking down K town and noticed the super cute interior from across the street. This place is on the third floor of a building so if you don't know it's there or see it from the street, you would walk right past it.We got a cocktail, something suggested to us by our waiter, it was probably one of the worst drinks I have had in my life. So badly balanced, and just tasted like chemicals. So after one drink we left, recently that same friend and I decided to come back in and give it another chance. It was a Friday so the place was packed. They have people sitting and eating at the bar but still invite you to order drinks from the bar. We were not able to sit if we weren't ordering food it took us maybe 20 mins just for a bartender to even look up. I went with a sparkling Paloma this time, I love Paloma's so thought I would like this. NOPE. Either the tequila was the cheapest thing in the world or the champagne was bad. Two sips in I physically felt sick, and I couldn't drink another sip. And this is saying a lot, I was in a local sorority in college and have had to chug many a horrible drink."

Visiting from out of state, it was our first experience with restaurants on top of each other in the same building. When you go into the lobby elevator, it'll tell you what floor the maze was it. Elevator was tiny and would probably fit about 3 people max. When it gets to the floor and the doors open, you step into a whole different world. They checked our vaccination card and ID up front before seating.When we came around 8, it was quite empty. We didn't mind because service was quick and prompt. The table was pretty small and ours was wobbly.We got the nachos, crispy sampler and kimchi cream pasta. The pasta was pretty good, portion is good for the price as well. Sampler was a great choice. Can't go wrong with fried food + alcohol :3There was only 2 of us so we had some leftovers but i think this is a great spot for friend hangouts and gatherings.

Ess-A-Bagel is a local chain with three locations around Manhattan. They tend to be very busy, the line goes out the door and spills out onto the sidewalk during peak hours. You can place an order online to save time. If you only want bagels, they have a separate line for that which is shorter and quicker. There are several bagel varieties, schmears, and toppings to pick from. You can customize your bagel to your liking or choose from a list of preset combinations and signature offerings. Fish by the quarter pound can be purchased as well. Plain with Cream Cheese -  This bagel was humongous and cream cheese was generous. It was a good bread to spread ratio, which made each bite fantastic. The bagel had a thin, perfectly slightly crisp outer layer. And the inside was bouncy, fluffy, and fresh.Everything Bagel with Cream Cheese and Lox - Same great big bagel with a bit of seasoning to make it more flavorful.

2242,c3eMI4_o4dPDDhPV_ibBYQ,11/14/2022,5 star rating,"Having not been to New York in nearly a decade, I turned to a fellow Yelp Elite member and NY food guru (side note: is there a function to tag Yelp friends in posts? I don't think so, but her food IG is @tsaiduckeats) for bagel recs near our activities in Midtown, and she recommended Ess-a-bagel. It did not disappoint!As many have said, the lines can get long. On a Saturday around 9:45, the line took a little over an hour. However, the staff works very efficiently so they really are moving a lot of people through at any one time; I recommend grabbing a coffee nearby to enjoy while you wait in line. The wait was worth it for us because the bagels lived up to the classic NY bagel texture! I did a salt bagel with a banana nut cream cheese -- weird combo, I know, but I love anything salty sweet and  really wanted to try the cream cheese since I felt like it was a fairly unique flavor. The cream cheese did not disappoint! It definitely delivered on banana nut flavor and had small walnut pieces in it. However, I think next time I will stick to my usual of a sweeter bagel with a savory cream cheese (this was the reverse). As others have mentioned, Ess-a-bagel has a very extensive cream cheese selection, so you can get creative with your bagels.Overall, I am definitely eager to go back and try some more of their offerings! Just remember that the wait can be long, so don't choose this spot if you are in a huge rush (unless you plan in advance and order ahead)."

Definitely get the sourdough bread to accompany that so you can soak up the delicious seasoned oil from the olives! Atmosphere was intimate and welcoming; felt like a nice European bistro.

It's friendly upscale atmosphere delivers some great service and delicious food. Tiffany started with a funky orange wine and I had Rye. The beef carpaccio with Beets, Arugula, Parmesan, and Sea Salt. We had then had the bucatini and monk fish. The pasta was out of this world good. The texture was firm yet pliable. The fish was done well with an okay portion with a white beans and butternut squash. This $125 meal (tip already included) was quite satisfying."
2245,c3eMI4_o4dPDDhPV_ibBYQ,6/9/2019,4 star rating,"Roman's may be one of my new favorite restaurants in Brooklyn! The menu changes daily though, so maybe we just got lucky with what was being served that day. The atmosphere is easy going and not stuffy, but still a great first date spot. For starters, we ordered the Smoking Goose Soppressata and Ricotta (forgot what was in the ricotta - tasted like spiced tomato sauce and green beans with cashews). The soppressata was the best I have ever had - very thinly sliced, flavorful, and soft like the texture of prosciutto. The ricotta was not outstanding but still good; the green beans complemented the plain ricotta well and the cashews gave the dish a nice crunch. The pastas were excellent! We ordered the spaghetti with green garlic, bottarga, and egg yolk & paccheri with pork ragu and broccoli rabe. You can't go wrong with pork ragu ever but the spaghetti is unusual in a good way. It almost tastes like the white sauce that comes with linguine alla vongole, with the fishiness coming from the bottarga. It has a beautiful green sauce that you don't see very often in pasta sauce (unless it is pesto). My favorite dish may have been the pork Milanese with sweet peppers and green olives. The pork meat was high quality and banged super thin. It was not greasy. The greens that came with it were spicy and packed full of flavor. It paired perfectly with the simple pork. There were also bits of sharp Parmesan pieces that enhanced the dish with some savoriness. Only critique would be the waitstaff - they checked in a little too much but at the same time did not give us what we would ask for. Well intentioned but forgetful."

I've been in three times in the two months since moving to the neighborhood, and each time the service has been exceptional - so much so that, every single time, I've gotten home and said to my wife some version of this: ""I was just in Roman's. The person who helped me was so pleasant!"" I mean, it's almost comical how friendly and professional the service has been in my experience. (Also, it's been a different person each time.) These people complaining about unfriendly service? They're probably dicks and deserved it."

The dishes are original and fancy however a great bang for your buck, leaving you wanting more with every taste. We had the fava bean puree (too die for), green garlic mussels (so fresh), and an orange/pistachio salad (so unique! and delicious). We shared the cavatappi pasta with sausage and beans, where you can taste the homemade pasta that melts in your mouth. The shop stoppers were the octopus and potato with an aioli dip and lamb chops for the entree. This place is a must go on your next date night or cozy night in."

2250,c3eMI4_o4dPDDhPV_ibBYQ,2/25/2018,2 star rating,"Roman's has a really fun atmosphere, which is somehow both upscale and local neighborhood spot at the same time.  I also admire places that are trying to go tipless to give their full staff better compensation.  But Roman's has more issues than those positive aspects can overcome.  For one, the food is good, but not great.  I really enjoyed the suppli (arancini with some cheese inside, basically), but the pasta special and a roasted duck entree were nothing to write home about, especially compared to the food being turned out at Italian places nearby like Evelina.  Worse are the prices, which, even accounting for gratuity inclusion, are outlandish given the portion sizes.  The duck entree, which the server said was ""sharing size,"" was actually what I would call a small entree (or a large ""small plate"").  It was also $48 -- meaning $40 without the tip -- making it more expensive than all of the entrees at 99% of the restaurants in Brooklyn.  As egregious are the drinks -- $16-18 minimum for a glass of wine, $15 or more for a cocktail.  My wife and I split those three dishes with a drink apiece, and left very hungry with light wallets.  Add in slow and supercilious service, and I doubt we'll be back -- too many good spots in the area now."
2251,c3eMI4_o4dPDDhPV_ibBYQ,10/14/2017,2 star rating,"Honestly I would never go back here or recommend it to anyone. The only reason why I gave it two stars instead of one was because the food was ok. The menu is pretentious, you have to ask your server to decode most of it for you. Then once you've overcome the language barrier there are more surprises in store. We ordered bruschetta and instead got hard stale bread in little toast bites similar to the ones my mother would probably make into croutons. When we talked to our server about our confusion his snobbery was out of control about ""the meaning of the word bruschetta"" and ""how bruschetta is traditionally served"". Honesty sir I'm a world traveler and I've been to many parts of Italy and this is a load of crap.The wine list did not have one bottle on it under $60. For such an ""upscale"" place in terms of menu and price of wine , the decor and ambiance is minimal. It feels like a nice version of your local diner. I understand places being a ""hole in the wall"" or minimal or paired down or unassuming with decor like for instance Sushi Gari on UES but this is isn't the same thing. The decor feels comfortable and inviting but then the menu food and service is just the opposite. I felt bait and switched! I've eaten at the Diner, Marlow and Sons and other restaurants that are part of the same group as Romans, and I didn't feel the utter disappointment I felt after that meal. Two thumbs down!

One guy even said they serve whatever of the 3 bottles they have as house wines. They didn't want to tell me what kind of Burgundy I was going to pay $30 a glass for after asking 2 servers.

I tried getting the red ramen Take off pork and add veggies but server said no can do. However, I'm happy I got the veggie ramen. I just added garlic oil and spicy oil and that made the difference in flavors. The noodles were cooked perfect, the broth was not to thick and it was nice and hot.

Fried tofu has a lot of bonito flakes on top but in thick soy sauce. Chashu taco is a creative fusion bite. My kid loves it. As for three different kinds of ramen, I especially love black ramen full with black garlic flavor. The broth is smooth and rich. Their Chashu is fatty enough and very fresh. Miso ramen is decent as well. Tan tan ramen has minced pork instead of Chashu and it blends in the soup so well that we finished whole bowl before we realized. Beer is $5 that you can't find this reasonable price in Manhattan.A perfect place for quick lunch, dinner or late night eats!"

All in, a good choice for the neighborhood.  Got here at about 5:20 on a Sunday and it filled up promptly afterwards."

I said I was craving ramen and just found this place was close and we both were down for ramen. Physical Exam:Taste - The ramen was outstanding. Rich broth with great depth of flavor. The Black Ramen has a sensational aroma from the black garlic that made it hard to ever put my chopsticks and spoon down. The pork chashu here comes in longer bacon-like slices as opposed to the round ones from a rolled-up pork belly. It's tender, flavorful, and comes thiccc as far as ramen chashu goes. I added spicy cod roe to mine, which provided both a hot kick as well as some extra umami (not that it was necessary) to the bowl. In addition to our individual ramen, we shared okonomiyaki as an appetizer, which is as pretty to look at as it is delicious. The pancake itself could easily be a meal, but you can't not order ramen here. Service - Lovely staff with a 5/5 water-refilling time. Saw my glass of Asahi was empty from a distance and asked if I wanted a refill. Food comes rather quickly, which is great for turnover because the shop is quite small in size. Environment - The restaurant has a tight, izakaya feel to it. Cozy, with small 2-4 person tables quite close to each other and an L-shaped bar offering a direct kitchen view. Watching the steam rise from every table and coming out of the kitchen in such a tight space offers a warm dining experience in the NYC fall/winter. It's a cute date or quick meetup spot, but not great for big groups. Assessment/Plan: Nishida Sho-ten is immediately one of my favorite ramen places in the city. It's a small place I feel like I can get a quick, satisfying bite before heading back to work or home. The prices are affordable, the ramen bowl sizes are generous, and the service is quick. The menu has a variety of small/medium bites to pair with a nice sake or beer, as well as curry dishes over rice if you're not looking to get ramen. But, why would you not order ramen here?"

You really get good bang for your buck with the extra noodles. We both ordered the Black with wavy noodles. The broth is rich and flavorful, & is definitely 100% better than most of the ramen restaurants in Queens. The noodles have the perfect texture - highly recommend the wavy. Each serving comes with the perfect amount of onion, half a marinated egg, 2 pieces chashu, and bokchoy.

I asked the difference between the two even though it was obvious and she said it's the same thing. I'm not dumb. You're not gonna have the same item listed twice.

I was given my food minus my holiday pie that I ordered and I told her she forgot my pie and she said no, that I didn't order one, in which I did, AND she said that she gave me my receipt, in which she didn't. Basically telling me to look at my nonexistent receipt and I would see that I'm wrong. I had her look back at my order on the register and she saw that she indeed owed me a damn holiday pie. Don't play with me. I sat down and swatted the pesky gnats away again before I dug in.My friend went to the bathroom while I cleaned off our own table.

I should've gotten my money back when I was there since I was aware that it was dated after I finished my food. Now I'm mad because I really wanted that pie! Listen just because you have money, doesn't mean you should franchise a McDonalds. Dung!"

2286,MulJEe-IjptlsWI4H_oxNA,2/4/2020,2 star rating,"Went to get some food for my parents and I. They gave me old unsalted fries, and an old flat Sprite. I asked for Tropic Berry Sprite and I was given regular sprite that was sitting there so long there was no ice in it. They always give the wrong sauces, don't listen  when asking for preferences in meals/drinks and always have a nasty attitude."
2287,MulJEe-IjptlsWI4H_oxNA,7/23/2019,1 star rating,The sign says dine in 24 hours but the staff just stared and wouldn't let us in. Seems off to advertise as 24 hours. Had I known the advertisement was fake I would have walked to another establishment. Very disappointed (which is saying a lot because in the wee hours of the morning my expectations were already low for any eatery).
2288,MulJEe-IjptlsWI4H_oxNA,8/3/2017,3 star rating,"Food is just like any other McDonald's. We came here for breakfast 'cause we didn't have much time to eat. There was a lot of people around 10am and there weren't much seats available either. We got lucky with our seats. We had no problem ordering our food and the cashier was nice. Tables and floors were pretty dirty though. But overall, it's a good place to hang around and if you need to grab something quick to eat."
2289,MulJEe-IjptlsWI4H_oxNA,4/22/2017,1 star rating,Hate to leave negative reviews but the service was unfortunate. The employees were rude and my grilled chicken salad took 20 minutes to produce instead a bacon & ranch crispy chicken salad... I understand being busy but no excuse to be rude to customers.
2290,MulJEe-IjptlsWI4H_oxNA,6/12/2019,1 star rating,"Everyone is miserable at this McDonald location. The staff are very lazy, rude, and inconsiderate that you just feel like you're not even welcomed to this location. So long story short, the line is very unorganized that it's scrambled everywhere and believe it or not, many tourist people are in this location a lot because of course, it's time square. So I was taking my order, the cashier is very rude towards me and her tone was like she doesn't care about her job. And then as I got my order, the staff had messed up my order and I realized that something is missing until I notify them that I'm missing the order until they gave me an attitude for no reason as if I bother them. So they threw the order at me rather than giving it by hand and they gave me this dead stare which I thought, ""wow, what kind of business and management are they running?"" I'm telling you, they need a better management, teamwork and more because the place is a total mess!  Absolutely not! Bathroom is dirty and I definitely won't be coming back to this location."

I confronted her and she lied straight to my face and waved me off as to dismiss me.I'm definitely calling to help department to have them reevaluate their current rating of A!I used to order every week from them.. I am never going back there and I strongly suggest that no one should ever go there again.
2295,f0VJirNbBXsS8Ihvv-Rs1g,9/5/2016,3 star rating,Nothing crazy. I got the general tsos chicken w white rice and broccoli. The broccoli had a wierd smell to it and the chicken was cut in such tiny pieces. The staff was really nice though from the lady that took my order to the delivery guy. But I doubt I'll get my go to Chinese delivery from them again.

2300,f0VJirNbBXsS8Ihvv-Rs1g,9/14/2015,4 star rating,"I would give 5 stars but they are not kind or make you feel welcomed, also because I said in person to the lady no vegetables and she put vegetables anyway. The food was really good and when my family tried it they loved it and asked where I got it. I got the general tsos chicken with pork fried rice. They have lunch specials for under 6$ but dinner time is over 8$"
2301,f0VJirNbBXsS8Ihvv-Rs1g,6/6/2017,3 star rating,"This place is hit or miss for me. The first time I ordered there, I had their boneless ribs. On appearance, they looked juicy and succulent. But when I had my first bite, they were completely bland. I was disappointed, but had no choice but to finish them. I know some would argue that I need to use a sauce, but I prefer to taste meals as is without adding additional seasonings on my end.The second time I went, I had their beef fried rice and the flavor more than made up for their bland boneless ribs. The meat was tender and juicy. And the rice didn't feel overly greasy at all. It was perfectly cooked. I'd give this place a higher rating if their food was great across the board. At the very least, their customer service was polite and prompt."

I ordered the Pappardelle con Funghi which has goat cheese and truffle oil - the flavors were good and the portion size was around what I expected. There is a side of bread given as well. The dessert options are also tasty - I tried the chocolate cake and it was super rich.
2304,CIV1wpkbmpdMPDCl1lNWhQ,11/18/2020,5 star rating,"This place will forever hold a VERY special place in my heart. After proposing to me, my Fiance brought me to San Marino's and surprised me with both our families being present for dinner! The owner was so kind and attentive to our very large party. They were accommodating and even allowed us to perform a few small religious ceremonies. They also allowed us to bring our own outside cake. The staff was also so patient with such a large party. I was too excited to thoroughly enjoy ALL the food. But I did have bites of the cheese pasta with black pepper and the mushroom pasta which were both DIVINE. The wine selection was enormous and the menu offered enough options for both vegetarians and meat eaters! I honestly cannot say enough good things about this place. Its worth it to give it a try. I most certainly will be back and it will forever hold a special place in my heart."
2305,CIV1wpkbmpdMPDCl1lNWhQ,5/22/2022,4 star rating,"I went to this restaurant with friends. Service was great. Food was expensive but there was nothing really special about the food. Has a very aged and outdated feel to it, so if you're looking for a place to go and have fun with friends, definite not the place. But if you would like to treat your parents for their birthday, might be ok. Still wouldn't recommend."
2306,CIV1wpkbmpdMPDCl1lNWhQ,9/17/2022,2 star rating,"One word: MEH.Came here on a Saturday evening, there were about 6 other people in the restaurant, and they told us that we have little over 1hr to eat bc there is an event after. However it took them 35min to put out 3 dishes, and the was mediocre at best (lamb chop sauce was too sweet); so I don't know why this restaurant deserves an average of 4.5 stars"

Not worth $18 for the amount you get, at all. I recommend Protos pizza if you are ordering pasta in the area, unfortunately they were closed tonight which is why I had tried San Marino."
2313,9mawr6QwVHm5q8JRXPFjPA,1/18/2020,3 star rating,"I would give Orso somewhere between 3-4 stars, but only because of previous reviews claiming this was their best meal in the city and my expectations were raised but not necessarily met. The food is solid but nothing to write home about. I was slightly disappointed since it seems like they're still going through some sort of utility check up/renovation and have a more limited menu (ie no pizza options). I had the linguine and mussels (w red sauce btw) which was good. Shared the buffalo mozzarella and arugula salad as appetizers, and the mozz was my favorite. If you're in the area for a show, Orso is a decent choice for a convenient meal close by but I wouldn't recommend coming out of your way for it. Service was great though, from coat check to waiters. They provided a complimentary scoop of gelato with a candle for a birthday in our party which was very sweet."
2314,9mawr6QwVHm5q8JRXPFjPA,5/27/2018,4 star rating,"Within the theater district it is usually a pretty safe bet to get mediocre food with rushed service, and Orso was a nice change from that.  The service was great, and fast, but not rushed, and the food was fresh and tasty, although some items were definitely better than others.The breadbasket came along with a side of white bean spread, and I have to say the spread might have been my favorite part of the meal.  Very similar to hummus, the spread was flavorful with delicious olive oil and and tons of herbs.  For my entree I ordered the derosa pizza with prosciutto, burrata, tomato sauce and mozzarella.  My least favorite part of the pizza had to be the crust, which was pretty bland and lackluster.  The toppings were delicious though, with thinly sliced pieces of salty prosciutto.  The burrata was also an added bonus of fresh, cold cheese that blended perfectly with the hot mozzarella.  I also had the chance to try my mothers spaghetti with roasted eggplant, burrata and tomato sauce and I have to say, I was a bit jealous I didn't order it for myself.There are a lot of very mediocre places to go in the theater district, but Orso provides a nice homey vibe, from the decor to the painted plates with animals on it."
2315,9mawr6QwVHm5q8JRXPFjPA,8/8/2019,4 star rating,"We ate at Orso before going to a show. Small restaurant with Good Italian food, traditional Italian wine list and pleasant service. There was a prix fixe menu, but you could order the items on it separately, as well as off the regular menu. The staff is extremely friendly and made us feel like we were regulars. My order was the roasted beet and grilled pear salad with pistachios, goat cheese and a balsamic reduction. For dessert, tiramisu which was delicious as well. Location is also great - 1.5 blocks from Times Square so close to theatres. For pre-theater it was fine."
2316,9mawr6QwVHm5q8JRXPFjPA,8/21/2019,5 star rating,"My friend, who works in Midtown, met me here for dinner, and the waiter was thoughtful to ask if we were on our way to a show so that he could help manage our time. We were not, so we didn't have to rush. I had the pappardelle with tomato sauce, and she had the lamb chops - and outordered me. While the pasta was delicious, the sauce was so simple (I get it - it's supposed to be a simple Pomodoro sauce), while the lamb was seasoned so nicely and served with a gorgeous veggie side. We each enjoyed the hosue wine, which was a great $ deal as well. Overall a nice dinner in a lovely spot!"
2317,9mawr6QwVHm5q8JRXPFjPA,8/27/2015,3 star rating,"The ambiance of the place is nice, the inside is charming and the dishes are pretty. I came here because I saw the reviews on yelp were up there. Around 5:15 the place was packed but I was the youngest person in there. The crowd is on the older side (maybe because I was there for an early dinner). The Caprese appetizer was my favorite part - the mozzarella cheese was extremely fresh. I got the fra diavolo pizza and it was just okay. I was expecting the sauce to have more spice, it sort of tasted like regular pizza sauce. I liked the thin crust and it wasn't greasy at all. The wait staff was very nice and accommodating.If I were to go back I'd try the pasta. Overall, there was nothing bad about my experience but there was nothing to make me want to run back here so quickly."
2318,9mawr6QwVHm5q8JRXPFjPA,6/14/2019,4 star rating,It is a great restaurant!!! The staff is extremely friendly and made us feel like we were regulars. They made me a special vegan meal which was absolutely delicious. Will definitely go again when I'm back in NYC.
2319,9mawr6QwVHm5q8JRXPFjPA,2/4/2017,2 star rating,"I would like to say its old school Italian; but it's not. It's more a tried tourist pre-theater spot. Limited menus, abrupt service - order a bottle of wine and are told that ""its casual service, so pour yourself"" - and very standard Italian fare. My microwaved penne was served on a cold plate with the top portion cool and the bottom warm, not exactly what you would expect for $23."
2320,9mawr6QwVHm5q8JRXPFjPA,12/5/2018,4 star rating,"We just left a very nice supper at Orso. Pasta cooked to perfection, all the food was delicious. We had a great bottle of red. But the server was a little surly. The restaurant was only 30% full and we waited 10-15 minutes just to get water and a menu. But we were there for the food and the food was worth coming back for."
2321,9mawr6QwVHm5q8JRXPFjPA,7/25/2018,5 star rating,"Made reservations through open table for a late after show dinner.  We had to change our reservation time to accommodate autographs at the Theater Door, Orso was very understanding.  We were seated right away with water and bread.  Appetizers were good and our entrees generous. The decor was cozy and pleasant and the food delicious.  I will dine here again post show."
2322,9mawr6QwVHm5q8JRXPFjPA,1/31/2019,5 star rating,Absolutely wonderful! Food was perfect and the wine was lovely! This is like a comfy upgrade from eating at your Italian grandma's house...very sweet and cozy with wonders food...service was nothing exciting but altogether wonderful!!

2326,5zitnnUq8B7Gmqrd_mTq2A,7/25/2021,1 star rating,I have gone to this restaurant in the past and have had good experience with the food and drinks.I went last week and they overcharged us for a large drink. They said because of covid prices have changed.  We had paid $25 before for a large drink and now it went up to $29 no extra shot or beer. I think that is too much to pay for one drink and It was not worth it for the price. Not even in Manhattan.I ordered a regular drink and they brought me a large drink acting as if I ordered it. I am glad I declined it. They do not have the drink prices listed in there menus. That is not professional to not inform customers and overcharge them. They have lost two customers. There are other restaurants in the area.

I ordered takeout from the stand instead of dining in. The service was quick, but I couldn't hear my order get called despite waiting right next to the counter. I just didn't think that the tartine was worth the hefty price tag since it was kind of flavorless. I haven't tried any of the other food items, so maybe I just didn't order the right thing. I came on a busy weekend so there was also no seating. I wouldn't really recommend this location unless you're just looking for coffee in the mall."

I asked if this was the right size, they told me they only offer one. Tasted as bad as it looked. Lukewarm and just no flavor. I don't know what to say.

Well there were many places that serve decent food and good prices you will be surprised what exceptional food at reasonable prices would a great atmosphere will do for a meal.Go here with confidence and enjoy everything

2338,oYmpJ1OXiYGr5IYSxlmGcw,7/15/2022,3 star rating,"I was looking forward to a cup of coffee before beginning an afternoon shift of work nearby.  The price for a small coffee was ""2.5"" and I deemed that survivable.  I got someone's attention at the counter and ordered a small coffee with half-and-half.  I was asked if I wanted something in it, and I asked for h&h, which was added.  When I got to my table, I found that the half-and-half in question was partly curdled - little dots and particles forming unappetizingly on the surface of the coffee.I returned to the counter, mentioning the problem, and the young man (who seemed all of 20) started to argue with me, stating that the date on the carton of half-and-half was July 26th, so no way was my cream sour.  He refused to smell it.  Eventually, a senior staffer heard my plight and was convinced, eventually, to open a new container but only after arguing with me that in August (this is mid-July), the milk and cream sometimes looks like that or goes bad more quickly.  Well?...  Once he pried open the new container, it was obvious that what was inside was noticeably fresher.  A new coffee was poured, but again, I had had to insist beforehand that I wanted half-and-half, not milk (in order to save these staffers from having to open something new).  This is customer service on a level of ignorance which just has to be called out and is truly frustrating and sad.  The coffee, ultimately, turned out to be hot and fine.  Someone behind the could learn from this, but true customer service seems to be in back of the line right now.  The young man, perhaps in a moment of learning, did say ""Sorry about that."""

They're located in The Shops at Columbus Circle on the 3rd floor and have a pretty view of the streets outside. We came on a Sunday afternoon and there was no wait for sit down dining. The menu is simple and consists of different coffee drink, pastries, and light lunch items (soup, salad, toasts). Their pastry shop is separate and right next to the sit-down dining area. Would recommend coming here if you wanted a coffee break from shopping."
2340,oYmpJ1OXiYGr5IYSxlmGcw,3/6/2021,4 star rating,Great little cafe in the Shops at Columbus Circle for a quick bite to eat. They have a great set up as they have an actual sit down cafe or takeout counter and tables/chairs you can sit at for a more informal meal. I ordered the lunch special ($12.50) and got the chestnut and mushroom soup and curry chicken toast. The soup was amazing and so flavorful! I wish I had gotten a whole bowl of it. The toast was good and enjoyed the grapes that were a pleasant surprise in the salad.

Everything there is absolutely fresh you cannot go wrong with whatever you pick.The staff there is warm and inviting so pick your breakfast snack lunch or a quick pick me up enjoy the views and enjoy the fantastic food from here.This is a definite go to place if you are within a five block radius. Well there were many places that serve decent food and good prices you will be surprised what exceptional food at reasonable prices would a great atmosphere will do for a meal.Go here with confidence and enjoy everything

2348,ByIhI19_bVFl5koNk0ylpw,7/15/2022,3 star rating,"I was looking forward to a cup of coffee before beginning an afternoon shift of work nearby.  The price for a small coffee was ""2.5"" and I deemed that survivable.  I got someone's attention at the counter and ordered a small coffee with half-and-half.  I was asked if I wanted something in it, and I asked for h&h, which was added.  When I got to my table, I found that the half-and-half in question was partly curdled - little dots and particles forming unappetizingly on the surface of the coffee.I returned to the counter, mentioning the problem, and the young man (who seemed all of 20) started to argue with me, stating that the date on the carton of half-and-half was July 26th, so no way was my cream sour.  He refused to smell it.  Eventually, a senior staffer heard my plight and was convinced, eventually, to open a new container but only after arguing with me that in August (this is mid-July), the milk and cream sometimes looks like that or goes bad more quickly.  Well?...  Once he pried open the new container, it was obvious that what was inside was noticeably fresher.  A new coffee was poured, but again, I had had to insist beforehand that I wanted half-and-half, not milk (in order to save these staffers from having to open something new).  This is customer service on a level of ignorance which just has to be called out and is truly frustrating and sad.  The coffee, ultimately, turned out to be hot and fine.  Someone behind the could learn from this, but true customer service seems to be in back of the line right now.  The young man, perhaps in a moment of learning, did say ""Sorry about that."""
2349,ByIhI19_bVFl5koNk0ylpw,5/5/2021,4 star rating,"This seems to be a new Tartinery location that opened up recently. They're located in The Shops at Columbus Circle on the 3rd floor and have a pretty view of the streets outside. We came on a Sunday afternoon and there was no wait for sit down dining. The menu is simple and consists of different coffee drink, pastries, and light lunch items (soup, salad, toasts). Their pastry shop is separate and right next to the sit-down dining area. Would recommend coming here if you wanted a coffee break from shopping."
2350,ByIhI19_bVFl5koNk0ylpw,3/6/2021,4 star rating,Great little cafe in the Shops at Columbus Circle for a quick bite to eat. They have a great set up as they have an actual sit down cafe or takeout counter and tables/chairs you can sit at for a more informal meal. I ordered the lunch special ($12.50) and got the chestnut and mushroom soup and curry chicken toast. The soup was amazing and so flavorful! I wish I had gotten a whole bowl of it. The toast was good and enjoyed the grapes that were a pleasant surprise in the salad.

The cocktails we tried were all gorgeous and delicious. My favorite is the Mother of Dragons Mojito - came with dry ice smoking on the top that lasted a while. Very creative and pretty design. The Librado Luxe also came with a smoking wood design. When you order on their menu, make sure you choose the cocktails with the * on the side, as they're the ones with the interactive/moving parts. The cocktails were on the expensive side, but the food is relatively cheap. The wagyu beef sliders were juicy and bigger than expected. Great snack to have with your cocktails!"

However the big turnoff is the very loud 1960s, etc. sounds  permeating the Lounge on the weekday evening that I was there.  That noise  to me is absolutely  inappropriate for the otherwise relaxing, visually attractive place. Due to the loud, inappropriate noise, I most likely will NEVER return to this Lounge with great views.  Instead I will go to the adjacent  quieter restaurant or other places for food and drink."

I first attended my company's holiday party there 3 years ago (held about 200+ attendees), and went back for my birthday with a party of 15 in 2020 and recently went for a friend's birthday in early December 2021. If you're looking for a night to dress up and go out for a city vibe, this is the place to go overseeing Columbus Circle. I started writing my review for Ascent Lounge in March 2020 and certainly feel comfortable finishing it right now. The bar and waiting service were great. Cocktails are always on point. The tables were separated into sections so it felt comfortable to be distanced while also having fun and dancing. Although not many people were dancing overall the last time I went despite the lively music so it must depend on the crowd each night. Definitely will be back :)"

There's so many more sweets I need to taste here, but I can only eat just so many calories.  Then again, just walking by you are accosted by the most luscious aromas of apple pie it's always so tempting just to pop in.  After all, they have regular and little sizes at their shop, too! The little pies are just enough for 2-3 people to share a snack (or even just one if you're feeling peckish). I definitely recommend trying them - that said, don't try the lattes here.  Their espresso and lattes is from a machine and it's not that great.  Stick with the sweets, their specialty, and you won't be disappointed."

My favorite is the sour cream apple pie-- between the crumbles on top to the sour yet sweet taste of the apples in the pie-- it's incredible. I've also gotten the pear and the triple berry. When I'm being ""good"" I get the sugarless apple, which is still so good despite being lower in sugar. My husband loved the banana coconut cream pie. I haven't tried one of their chicken pot pies yet, but they are definitely on my list!"

They also have cakes, cookie, brownies and cupcakes. I ordered a small size banana coconut cream pie, there are big chunks of banana in the middle, covered with cream and shredded coconut. It's not too sweet and perfect for just a dessert after meal for 2-4 people family. The pie is delicious."

That was pretty much my experience when I bit into a piece of their Sour Cream Apple Pie. Mind you, apple pos is my favorite dessert and being in my advanced years I have tried countless varieties. What can I say, I'm an apple poe guy. This, my friends was the best I've ever had. It was a gift so I have absolutely no idea how much it cost, where they bought it or how to buy it but I am here to tell you if you have the opportunity, it's ridiculously ridiculously good."

I would like to try the coconut cream pie and the Mississippi mud pie next. I also want to comment on the packaging. I love that each pie is wrapped well and comes with a sticker that has instructions on how to re-heat the pie at home. It takes the guesswork out of figuring out what temperature to heat up the pie. Service wise, the staff is friendly and know their pies, so if you need a recommendation, just ask."

We could not define which root vegetable was which, and considering it wasn't good anyway, it really didn't matter.

At first I thought the place was kind of random - a cereal and ice cream bar in a high-end sneaker store?! But it's more than just a gimmick - that cereal infused ice cream was some of the best I've had. I'd say I like this place more than the cereal milk soft serve at momofuku milk bar- it's about the same price and significantly larger. You basically pick a cereal and your toppings - for me I tried Apple Jacks and Kit Kat. They then stick it in this device that blends everything together and distributes it evenly throughout the whole soft serve. It was so delicious. So rich and creamy...and with the cereal flavors and bits that bring you back to your childhood! It's basically like a high-end/fancy McFlurry that tastes infinitely better.I haven't had a chance to try the cereals yet, but will have to drop by again one of these days. Looks like you can select a preset combo that's inspired by various athletes (for example the last time I was there it looks like there was a combo from Victor Cruz), or you can create your own cereal concoctions.If you are in the neighborhood, definitely need to drop by!"

I saw someone get a milkshake in Bam Bam and it was much bigger."
2427,fanlKZzN-fI9LywqQD6EHg,8/28/2015,4 star rating,"Based just on the main gimmick and thing that has been in the food news about this place, the cereal, it would be more like a 2 star rating. However, the lesser advertised Ice Cream Cereal Swirl they do here is pretty incredible, which saves it from being a very underwhelming experience.When you enter KITH, which is some kind of hip sneaker store that I didn't care about since it didn't involve ice cream, the KITH Treats portion is right in the front on the left side. You can grab a menu card and fill it out, choosing either 2 cereals ($6) or 3 cereals ($7) from a list of 23 different varieties, and then your type of milk (whole, skim, almond, hemp, chocolate) and finally toppings for $.75 from a huge list of stuff like brownie bites, Oreos, Kit Kats, M&M, and tons of other candy bars and such.If you're the type of person that panics from the Build Your Box type of setup, there is a handy list of preconfigured ""Specials"" written on the wall, featuring cereal/milk/topping combos named after artists and other influential people for millennials and hipsters.The first one listed, The Bam Bam by Action Bronson, is by far the best, consisting of Rice Krispies Treats cereal (which they were out of unfortunately), Cookie Crisp, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Kit Kat, Oreo, Marshmallow Charms and Skim Milk. The prices wisely aren't included on the wall, because If you do the math, that works out to an astonishing $9.25. To make matters worse, they don't actually make it for you in a cool way or even give it to you in a mini collectible shoebox like the other review and the news I read about it mentioned. Instead, you get a small portion of each cereal and topping in an individual bag or container, all placed into a shopping bag for you to take to go and assemble. I saw a ""Commuter Bowl"" mentioned at the Express Window for $5, so maybe that's a better experience, but for the $9.25 for the bag of ingredients, it stung quite a bit.Luckily, to ease that pain, I also tried the Ice Cream Cereal Swirl, which was awesome. Does anyone remember the dearly departed Eskimix from a few years ago? (yelp.com/biz/eskimix-new…). This thing is just like that, where they take an ice cream base (vanilla in this case) and swirl in cereals and toppings - kind of like a McFlurry, but so much better and blended in more. You can choose 1 cereal and 1 topping from the same list as the Build Your Box mentioned above. I went with Cookie Crisp and Reese's Pieces, which turned out to be an incredibly good combo ($5.50).I don't think I'll try the cereal again, but any time I am in the vicinity, I will definitely stop in for more of the excellent ice cream swirls. If they let you add in another cereal or topping, the combinations become pretty much endless, so there is a lot of fun stuff to try to justify several return trips."

Go for a sweet treat, go to feel less than (but who cares when you're eating ice cream), whatever you do, just go! Also, don't even kid yourself and look at the dope hoodies they have.

I did not want to be in sugar shock so, i went with the JLP.  AFTER I paid, i found out the coconut flakes were finished so I replaced them waffle cone pieces.  Mind you it's was like 3:30pm.  The gent put on his gloves, dipped the ice cream and churned out the crunchy soft serve finished product.  The flavor was pretty bland with the occasional pop of caramelly cookie crunch of Twix.  Other than that,  unremarkable.  Would i try it again? Not at a few pennies shy of $10.  I had a special combo at Air Max day a few years ago and it was spectacular.... this was certainly not it."

It wasn't as presentable as I'd hoped for it to be, but that doesn't matter when it tastes good. It's a bit on sweeter side so sharing this with 3 other friends didn't make me feel guilty. As we finished it, I was seriously about to grab a straw and drink the melted parts. I wanted to lick the cup clean. I'm sure any other Cereal and Mix-In will make for a yummy combo with either the Vanilla, Chocolate or Coconut-based Ice Cream that I would have to try next time.We visited the Brooklyn location on a Thursday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all. However, I did go to the SoHo location on a Saturday afternoon where it was busier. As for the retail experience, both the Brooklyn and SoHo locations were pleasant places to shop at.

I got the soft serve with Cinnamon Toast Crunch and KitKat as the topping. And omg... I WAS IN LOVE!!! I am not sure if I just picked the right ingredients but I loved the smooth yet slight crunchy texture. It did not look as appetizing as other desserts, but who cares! This place is genius!!It is located on the first left, right when you walk into their clothing/shoe store. Its very small but they have multiple options to choose from. It is near Barclays Center at Prospect Heights. Heads up - take a train here as you will most likely have no luck with the parking. The only reason I give this place a 4/5 is because of the price. I got it for $7.65 (tax already included) which I find very overpriced since I know the ingredients are cheap (its cereal and vanilla mix, cmon). I walked in thinking it was going to cost $5.50. The serving size is too small for over $7. I would definitely come back if they stuck to its original price. I would still recommend others to try it though. Its delicious!!!"

Small place, 12 people per seating, hip and edgy with an excellent staff. You have to experience it to know what I and others are talking about. It is so much fun being there, and the food is great. It is an omakase meal but not done in the traditional way.  Lots of laughing, singing, and drinking of unlimited sake. The food was great, really interesting flavors and combinations. Maybe not the best omakase I've ever had but it is up there. This was the first time I tried an oyster and actually enjoyed it.  It is a 15 course meal with a lot of variety. Several appetizers, several prices of sushi, a roll, and dessert (dessert is probably the weakest point bust it doesn't really matter). Also, my wife doesn't like sushi so they served all of her sushi courses as sashimi for her, really nice!If you like sushi just book it and you won't regret it (if you can get a reservation).  And when you get there it's downstairs."

That's all apt, but while we arrived for our 9:30 reservation a few Saturday nights ago already armed with this info, we were still surprised at the superlative nature of the experience. The food was better and more inventive than we expected, the drinks more free-flowing, and the party vibes even more intense. (The sushi MC [and a corresponding neon sign], for example, cheerfully instructs all of the guests to ""Enjoy your ----ing dinner!"")I'll provide as much information as I can remember about the food:-course 1: an oyster, which I'll call the Welcome Oyster: really good, served with delicious roe and had some sort of a soy-based sauce -course 2: Fatty tuna, served as a little sandwich and topped with caviar. I remember sesame oil. Also so good.-course 3: A little bowl of mackerel, bathed in a delicious thai curry. -course 4: I kid you not, a giant CBD bubble is released into a martini glass of yellowtail. Now, mind you, all the while, the sake  was flowing, a two-man jazz band was serving up the hits, and people were starting to get a liiiiittle rowdy, yet the fun-loving-but-still-professional Sushi on Me team was still able to adeptly hold our attention with the food. -course 5: salmon with tamarind sauce, served in a glass and smoked right at the table. What after that? Well, I can tell you that the sushi continued to be delicious and served with precision and skill. By this point, it was mostly nigiri pieces and I believe we also had a mochi dessert. But also, the jazz band was packing up, the dancing was starting, and the diners were (with the staff's blessing) starting to wrest control of the playlist. By the end it was an all-out dance party, and since we were the last group of the night, we got to stay just a bit after hours. Do what you can to snag a reservation far in advance (they're hard to come by), bring cash (cash only, $89 w trout tip) and enjoy."

Every piece of sushi & every round was a whole different experience. The fish was so fresh and they really had such a great array of different fish. Each bite was so complex, and original. Favorites were the scallop, and of the tuna dishes and all of the fun white fish bites I've never had before. Personal preferences for me are no salmon and umi, but I gave those to the people I was with. For the complimentary sake, it was actually a better sale then I thought. We did have to ask for a third glass, but once they knew we could handle our liquor they kept it flowing. Will be back, often!"

Prepared to be hand-fed some sushi & PSA there is a CBD infused course. I feel horrible for leaving a 4 star review because I LOVED my experience at sushi on me. It was easily one of the best omakase experiences I had! The 1 star reduction is mainly because it was so.freaking.packed. I went as a party of 3, and we were in the middle of the bar so I felt literally packed-in like a sardine. I felt like I couldnt even eat comfortably because I was worried I would bump the person next to me. The only other thing to mention was that they didn't anounce the CBD bubble course until it was too late? Luckily it doesn't matter for me but there was another party that night who had already finished eating when they announced the smoke was infused with CBD, and mentioned they could get in trouble for it if their work happened to randomly drug test. So i guess-- PSA there might be a CBD course! :xEverything else was AMAZING and I honestly can't wait to go back !"

However, I think the bar experience is definitely worth it.Food and alcohol: 4/5We had the Course Omakase which is a nice assortment plates ( 3 appetizers, 5 pieces of sushi, 1 hand roll, mochi dessert). They were able to change one of my dishes since I am lactose intolerant but, I was left with nothing for dessert.My favorite part was the THC and CBD infused appetizers but, I can see why it may freak out unexpecteding patrons. Unless, you are used to someone puffing on your food. The sake was nice and smooth and constantly refilled. Honestly, I was not full after this but, nicely buzzed. So, if that is worth $120 (after tip) then do it.Experience: 5/5 Honestly the chef's engagement with us at the bar is what made this experience. They are very nice, funny, and provided the best energy during the gloomy rainy day. All dishes were plated beautifully, come out promptly, and alcohol refilled regularly.All on all, I would love to are my friends here for an exciting treat. But, may eat something before!"

The staff was energetic, funny, and interacted with customers throughout the whole meal. At one point, my boyfriend got to torch some fish and people even got up to dance.The food was just as great - not only did each dish look like an artwork, the flavors were so unique (e.g. one dish had thai curry sauce on it).

2441,R1OlpKHgFM4wW8f_UtGf4w,7/26/2022,4 star rating,"As long as each bite in an omakase course is an umami bomb, I do not care if I'm at the hushed counters of the highest end sushi restaurants or at a new age omakase counter billing themselves as ""not your mother's omakase"" while hip hop blares through their speakers. Sushi On Me fits into the latter camp, with their chefs shouting things like ""enjoy your fucking sushi"" or ""this is a piece of fatty fucking tuna"" so often to the point of comical, caricature performance. They do this while pouring unlimited shots of surprisingly decent sake into your cup in a setting that can only be described as an unfinished basement. While I felt they were trying much too hard to be crass and different, the food was pretty good for the low price of $90 + tax and tip, and I had fun dining and drinking to my heart's content with my group of friends.I like that the meal started with appetizers, followed by sushi pieces, with unlimited pours of sake for the hour or so the meal lasts for. Note that they only accept cash payments so hit the ATM before your visit. The appetizers were actually some of the strongest bites in the whole meal, so I understand why they'd start with those dishes, which ranged from an oyster on the half shell topped with crispy shallots and ikura, to salmon smoked in a bell jar and what I think was cod in a gingery, curried sauce. These were more memorable than the sushi pieces, which were each pretty good but somewhat similar to one another.I remember the soundtrack being as bewildering as the basement itself, which looks a bit more charming in pictures than it does irl. It kind of looks like the unfinished basement of a random coworker's house you might go to, complete with a stand up piano, stained glass lamp, cork walls, and a disco ball hanging in a corner. Not sure I'd call it charming, but I'm find it sort of endearing they didn't really put any care into the ambience of the place. I guess a bougier spot would feel more out of place out here in Elmhurst, especially given the space is literally set in a basement on a quiet Queens street.Would I recommend a visit? Sure, if only to participate in the conversation around the dichotomy of omakase meals that cost as much as someone's rent and sub $100 ones. Isn't that what motivates us all to dine out? (only half kidding)."

This 1 hour meal is an EXPERIENCE from start to finish -- Favorites were the scallop, tuna sandwich, and handroll. This is a great place for a small group of friends, or book out the whole 12 seater for your large party. Incredibly fun experience. Tip -- book the last seating of the night if you want to extend beyond the hour."

I have been eating their pizza since I was a child and it still puts a smile on my face. The margherita pizza is the one to get and make sure to get two pies so that you don't have to share yours. The only other 2 pizza joints that I eat at are Grimaldi's in Dumbo and De Fara in Midwood. All the others is just not worth eating. I highly recommend Patsy's and you will not be disappointed.

Specifically:- garlic bread: fresh and very garlicky and olive oily, which gives it a double thumbs up - mozzarella sticks: definitely get this if you are dining in! Even with delivery, it was warm and cheesy. The marinara sauce that accompanied it was great too- cheese pizza: really reminded me of pizza in Italy. The chest is thin and the cheese is not overpowering. All in all, solid choice- ai funghi: three different mushrooms in a pizza which makes it nice and hearty. Something was missing though for me. I think it was the lack of truffle oil or tomato base that made it a bit more plain that other mushroom pizzas I've tried in the cityUPDATE: came to eat in person last night and had a great experience! We got a table in the back patio which was nice and spacious. The baked clams were delicious. The fried artichoke hearts were mediocre so would skip that. The Margherita pizza was absolutely delicious!"

I can't even criticize the small mishaps and delays because they are really working their asses to cover all the checks and orders in while getting the food out.

Nice crusty bread was perfect to sop up the excess juice. Fries were salty not too much, just right!Service was quick even though the place was packed, not an empty seat on the house.

We didn't want to make a big deal, the waiter killed it with his hand? We lost our appetites and hurried up to finish our glass of wine and leave. No one checked in on us, no one mentioned it, no one cared that we had not even been half way through our meal.THEN A SECOND COCKROACH FELL FROM THE CEILING AND ON TO THE SHOULDER OF THE WOMAN NEXT TO US! We all freaked out, stood up, didn't know what to do. Once again, no one cared or even asked what was going on until we told them. They asked both parties if we wanted to move tables?The kicker: The manager walked past us while we were recovering from the falling roach and asked ""Are you guys from New York or.....?""In my seven years of living and eating in NYC, I have never seen one, let alone TWO, live roaches inside of a restaurant. Not a penny was comped, no one checked in to see if we were okay, they carried on business as usual and my skin is still crawling. Only eat here if you are also a roach."

Not overly ""eggy,"" which is sadly rare to find in an omelette. The home fries were perfectly seasoned, with what tasted like bits of caramelized onion sprinkled throughout."

I came here instead of Chelsea Market, because the former happens to be too crowded, and I was looking for more Asian food options, seemingly to be the highlight of some reviews. Let me say, I was quite let down. This Asian food does not even compare to much, much more authentic and quality restaurants all across the city, which would also be cheaper. The only good parts about Gansevoort were that my friend was able to eat this sandwich from Chelsea Market here, and there was space. Despite the emptiness at 1 pm on a Sunday, it was not quiet either, because someone brought his dog in and it barked a lot."

I ended up seeing Los Panchos Taqueria (if someone can direct me to their proper Yelp page, that'd be nice!). Food was pretty solid. I ordered basically a Chipotle-style bowl. Lots of veggies in the bowl and the verde sauce is key. Definitely a filling lunch for sure.Gotta try more here."

Often I feel when I order seafood paella that I'm ripped off on the amount of seafood but this one was perfect! I also picked up a few cookies and goodies from Two Geese Bakery - it sits right at the entrance and I couldn't leave without stopping after the fresh baked smell hit me walking in. The matcha canele was perfect and I'm afraid I could eat several in one sitting. The staff were super nice in explaining the menu to me, and understanding when the list of delicious-sounding items made me feel a bit indecisive.  Also, the inside was spotless, staff all wore ppe, and kept everything spaced out. Next time I can't wait to try the Japanese curry (a must for winter) and more cookies and caneles. 10/10 recommend, I'm jealous of those working in the area that can come here on every lunch break!"

Many times I see people come enjoy the dogs without bringing one of their own!Our dog Peekaboo loves Boris & Horton. He can get his play on in AC on hot summer days which allows him to thoroughly exhaust his energy while not dying from the heat (he's a snow dog). Us humans can chill with free wifi, drinks and snacks and even use the space to get some work or reading done. It's definitely not a quiet place, as some dogs are talkative, and some humans must repeatedly shout things at their misbehaving pets. Dogs are frequently running and chasing each other and having the time of their lives!There are options to buy toys, merch, and treats for your pups! We often get our dog a pupper cup (a dog friendly icy treat that is dairy free!) or a pastry and he LOVES them. Just be careful when giving your pup his or her treat, as fights can break out over food!Please don't bring your pup if they are aggressive or have not been socialized. This is a highly stimulating environment, often with lots of people (most days almost every table is filled) and lots of pups running around in a rather small place. I can see this place being very intimidating to a dog that is not used to being around other dogs. Using excuses like, ""my dog just doesn't like big dogs"" is really unfair to all the big dogs in the space. If your dog doesn't get along with everyone, this place isn't for them!"

From what I remembered, the babkas were located on the shelves near the entrance. I looked there and all around, did not see any. So I went to ask the cashier. Her response ""It should be over there."" No type of specificity or pointing in a direction. Superrrr helpful I finally located them on the top shelf of a rack all laying flat with no signage. Hence, why I couldn't find them. Grabbed one and paid. Wasn't offered a bag, so I asked for one. The cashier, (middle aged woman with glasses) practically rolled her eyes, as if I'm asking for her kidney. I'm 100% on board with reducing bag usage and such. But if you're an establishment selling prepared foods, offer people bags! Or at least don't give customers an attitude for asking for one. That's fucking absurd. The service I received by aforementioned cashier definitely had some racist undertones, as she was all bubbly and friendly to the other non-Asian patrons. The babka wasn't worth the trash ass service. Will not return."

Outside is crispy and inside is soft. I used it to make prosciutto Arugula Avocado sandwich and it tasted like heaven! Well don't wait, eat it, don't leave it to second day as the texture is completely different. For the French Sourdough, they slide for you upon request. Really good & will go again"

Baguette + butter = pure happiness, so I was happy to see that I had a bakery with baguettes close by. Chewy inside and crusty outside, nice browning, very flavorful, this is a great baguette.Also couldn't not get an almond croissant, which is one of my favorite all time baked goods. Very good. Not too sweet, good ratio of almond paste to croissant, browned crust adds some depth and welcome bitterness.Will have to come back for the babka and rugelach."

I had initially just stopped in for a cup of hot water while waiting for some friends nearby. I sat outside by one of their heaters to warm up on a chilly December evening. My wife noticed my location on the find my friends app and pleaded for a chocolate babka. The babka endured several hours of cold cycling, but it was scrumptious once I brought it home. We ate some as is and we heated some of it up. Quite chocolatey and sweet. The babka held together well yet pulled apart nicely. Certainly some of the better babka that you'll encounter in NY."

It's been weeks since I've been to the Breads Bakery and I am still Dreaming about this amazing chocolate almond croissant decadent treat. I highly recommend dropping in for one of their perfect pastries and a cup of their freshly brewed coffee. Next time I'm in NYC this will be my first stop. Or at least my breakfast.

It was good, though I wish the bun were a little less soft and chewy. I also tried a chocolate croissant, which was typical with two strips of chocolate across the pastry and was not especially voluminous. The jewish desserts look promising and I look forward to (re)visiting on the holidays. Can't attest to service as another person in my party picked up the items and brought them to me."

It was almost no costumers and I placed my order. I was waiting almost forever for 8 cannolis, i think for 15-20 min. It was so so slow. And when they finally arrived (it was nicely, they brought them on tray) tadammmm they changed me $12 for small tiny 8 pieces. They tasted ok, but I'm definitely will never come back.

The cake was just a waste of money"

I am upset because I provided them with a photo to replicate from and it looked nothing like it. It look like they just piped the frosting, thew a layer on top, then piped it again. The third layer was ideal and something I imagine. I've seen photos of their naked cakes online and they've done a beautiful job on others. I am reconsidering using them for my wedding. Why I gave them a 4 star? Because of the frosting, texture of the cake, flavor, and how moist and fresh it was. I really enjoyed eating it. Every slice just melted in your mouth. Would I purchase from this bakery again? Yes! If the cake was fresh and super good, I could just imagine how great their other bake goods are."

The first time I came was for canolis and they were nice and fresh and not too sweet. This bakery has been around since 1946. This is seriously the best bakery in the Bronx. You can Pre ordered cakes or you can pick up one same day of the ones they have available. They have a great list of flavors I got the dulce de leche and some tiramisu and yummmmm! The price it's beyond reasonable. For the quality of cake it's a great price. The place is great for groups they have tables of four.  Definitely recommend if you're in the Bronx they have two locations I prefer this one as it's more convenient. They have all sorts of goodies. This is a very popular bakery during the holidays so be prepared for a little wait.  But It's worth the wait!!

The bakery,  the display, everything, looks like something you see in a magazine or Christmas movie. My boyfriend and I ordered two dulce de leche mini cheesecakes, two tres leches cakes, two raspberry mini cheesecakes and two slices of red velvet cake. -- All of the desserts were amazing and fresh. Unfortunately the first thing I asked for was a hot chocolate. I was specifically told that they were not making beverages because they take too long to make (?). After like ten seconds, I saw a lady order a hot beverage, and the employee happily smiled and made for her. I felt awkward. I am guessing that she is a ""regular."" The employee probably thought that I was just there for a hot chocolate, and for that reason did not give me good service.Too bad that I was actually excited to come here, and due to my negative experience,  I do not think I will be back. This bakery did not feel too welcoming."

It opened my eyes to how the deliciousness of a cannoli could be crafted into a cake and used to celebrate birthdays. The cake is so fresh and there's plenty of cream, and in the middle there are little chocolate chips that made it look and taste like an inverted cannoli. Would love to try some of the other cakes here!"

I like their decor and small commemorative section for Joseph Artuso (the founder). There are few seating tables on the side and staffs were friendly. They have huge variety of pastries and cakes. It can be a little pricey compare to others Italian bakery. We ordered one pound of assorted cookies, Sfogliatella and mini pastries. Sfogliatella and the mini pastries were really good. The following day, Sfogliatella was still fresh and crispy. The only complain was the cookies, some were fresh and some tasted old. I highly suggest to her the mini pastries."

As we were seated, we weren't given no menu and had to wait to flag down the server. Mind you they had only one guy working in the main floor..We had to keep waiting to get his attention and it was all over a mess. We didn't get no utensils...napkins...water....for these things we had to wait And ask for them. The food wasn't even that great to be honest. The fries though were delicious. The garlic wings were salty and fatty. The fried chicken was whatever. I just like that the fact that this place is halal but other than that I don't think I'll be back here because the service was purely lacking and definitely not worth the price!"

The was no need for any additional condiments. The fries that came with our mains were thick and sweet. Love the fries. The garlic wings smelled so good and looked tasty. They were okay though,  too much sauce. They were more fatty than meaty. The mains were not satisfyin, just filling. The burger was drenched in bbq sauce and was really small. The sauce wasn't bad just sweet and overwhelming. It was the same with the beef ribs. They came boneless and while they were easy to pull apart it seemed that the sauce was just poured on top of them. I didn't try the fajita. It canne out sizzling of course and looked good. My friend ate all of it but he said it was okay. Mera's Tip: have the fries."

When the burger came out I was super confused about how to eat it, it looked like a volcano monster tbh. And, oh boy was it spicy?! BUT the flavor was amazing and the heat of this burger can make you question some life decisions lol The people at the restaurant warned us a lot of times but I still went ahead with it. I don't really regret it because I did enjoy the heat and flavor for the couple of bites I was able to get. I would only recommend this to you if you like SUPER spicy food and can actually handle the heat. And, don't eat this on empty stomach like me. Overall, I enjoy my experience and the foods. Service was amazing because the people there were super nice and the outdoor bubble dining was a pretty unique experience which I enjoyed."

Crispy chicken burger and tenders were ok, not extraordinary but better than a aerate. The other two burgers were a complete miss. The parties came with some type of onion curry and even being a Pakistani, I couldn't digest the idea of a curry in a burger. May be others like it but it was a miss for me. May be execution wasn't as expected. Strawberry shake we ordered was a average and everything was over priced for the quality."

This time around I can't say the same. I ordered the atomic wings and out came 6 miniscule baby wings that I was charged $10 for. Any other place I could've gotten 6-8 LARGE wings for the price. The sauce was underwhelming.The Rib-Eye steaks also was underwhelming. It was probably less than half an inch thick and although buttered and seasoned great - the quality was not there in terms of the meat.Lastly, I was under the impression that the tip at the end was the end all be all for the waiters and waitresses. However, they charged a 10% service fee for dining in AND another 3.5% fee for using a credit card. My thought to be $170 meal ended up after taxes and all these fees $238. This is ridiculous and I will not be coming back to highway robbery."

For main, my sister and I shared the Addys Amarillo house burger, with the mushroom sauce- it was amazing..never tasted mushrooms this delicious before. Then we had the Rib Eye Steak, which was very tasty, along with the Chicken Mishkaki! All this food was more than enough for us for a great price. The waitress was attentive and kind. I definitely recommend and will be back iA."

I guess the wrapper could've been thinner and dumpling bigger, how we it tasted fine. It's a small shop with a restroom down deep in the basement. Next time I'll try the noodles, the tourists seem to be enjoying them especially in during this cold weather."

We ordered the: * Scallion pancakes - 6 pieces with a lovely crisp and perfect saltiness* Soup dumplings - tasty but nothing particularly stellar about it (I wish that they provided us spoons to eat it with and the soy sauce/vinegar mix that usually accompanies the dish)* Dan Dan noodles - wonderful flavor profile, tiny bit spicy, option of veggie or ground pork (pork was wonderfully seasoned)* Miso ramen - (not my opinion) but it was noted that the broth was not so meat-forward (not too strong, not too mild) and had good reviews* Mala spicy - Served in a large soup bowl to keep your soup warm. I requested replacing the rice noodles with egg noodles (which I'm sure was quite offensive as they are known for their rice noodles...) The dish had a good amount of spice, umami broth, and plentiful pork portions. My biggest complaint was the dryness of their char siu that lacked fattiness in the cut. Additionally, the toppings felt pretty sparce. Service was spot on and the food came out relatively quickly after ordering! I had a pleasant experience and would dine again!"

The service was amazing, and everyone was so kind!! I will absolutely be back here. Space: The space is cute and clean!Food: I liked how thin the dan dan noodles were. It meant that the sauce to noodle ratio was higher than normal. (They also put the sauces on the side so you can add the right amount) My favorite dan dan noodle i've ever had in the city!"

Anyways, she never took her eyes off her phone even when she was making the coffee. The coffee came a bit thicker than the Turkish coffee should be and it usually is served with a small piece of sweet to balance the taste but there was none.

We left with a container FULL for about $16, not bad. Many were unique kinds that I've not had before- they also have delicious renditions of the ""regular"" kind we all know and love from our favorite Mediterranean eateries.

All their ingredients are IMPORTED FROM Turkey. Hence flavorings and textures will be closer to original Turkish recipes. For instance, did you know that American pistachios will never have that deep green color that you will experience on Anteplis' pastries, because only Turkish Pistachios maintains that deep green hue and amazing flavor and texture. As of this writing they are now serving Turkish Breakfast on weekends only, which consists of olives feta cheese, cucumbers, red peppers, hard boiled egg and sujouk (beef sausage) honey butter and cheese filo pastry and plenty of bread and Turkish tea.

Having had many stale baklava throughout the years, I finally experienced what fresh, just-made baklava tastes like - and it's pretty freaking amazing. I had the intention of walking in to get a piece or two but after the owner offered me a piece to try I was addicted - and walked out with a whole container of different varieties. Although they were all delicious, I liked the small squares of the original baklava the most - it's really to die for. If Sweet Arayssi was candy heaven - this place sure is baklava heaven."

Anthony is very knowledgeable about the products that he sells and you can tell he knows what he's talking about because he doesn't mind the questions (I had a lot). He was super helpful with helping me select the tea that I wanted to try and had a whole convo with me and another customer while he was making my tea. I tried the Captain America one and it tastes so good. I will definitely be going back to try the shake next time. The music and the vibe in there is really chill too."

I really love the delicious teas and shakes and more importantly, I love walking in and being greeted by Anthony's warmth, sunny friendliness! That right there is priceless to me!The teas give a gentle energy boost that helps me to carry on with my day, especially on my super busy days when I'm running from work to belly dance class! And the shakes give me a nice protein boost to help my muscles grow and sustain themselves. But the biggest benefit I've gotten is being able to grab a nice, healthy, delicious treat without the guilt of swallowing all my day's worth of calories :)Have yet to try something on their menu that I dislike :)"

Since we arrived a little early, there is a waiting area under a tent where you can order drinks before the table frees up. Didn't have to wait too long, however, as we were seated a few minutes later.Brunch menu is fairly extensive, with classic breakfast options (albeit at higher prices). Settled on the Smoked Salmon Benedict ($25) - a layering of salmon, poached egg, and hollandaise over English muffins. Egg is perfectly runny in the middle, pairing well with the intense salmon. Muffin is a bit tough to cut through, but fine enough to cap the meal. As a side, chose the fries option - well crisped and salted, served alongside some ketchup. Service brings this place up to five stars. This is a team effort as multiple people come by to take orders, fill water, and serve drinks. Definitely one of the better options for outdoor dining in the area."

My husband's $30 branzino was also pretty minimal and not anything special. Our friends shared the $30 fish and chips, which consisted of a few small pieces of fish and fries. Drinks were expensive and just okay. Our total came out to about $300 for those three entrees, a bottle of basic white wine, three cocktails, and two desserts. My husband also noticed a few days later that they charged him for the meal twice!I will say the service was amazing - our waiter knew the menu backwards and forwards and was very friendly and attentive. The ambience of the restaurant is also very nice - cute indoors and outdoors areas with a relaxed feel. Would probably skip this place and go elsewhere next time as I am sure there are many other options where your money would be better spent."

20,u5gLdI6l6zsPxL2kOYbyfw,5/19/2022,3 star rating,"TL;DR: Family style Italian with a two-toned rustic but quaint feel. The meatballs are especially good, but I wouldn't recommend the pizza. Good place to visit on Sundays - they offer a two person meal for $35. We dipped in here on a Thursday night @ 9 and the place was still popping! They are usually busy so we were especially excited for the food. The Sopressata pizza was okay; it didn't have much flavor despite the amount of toppings. The fact that there was no sauce probably played a big part of that.The meatballs, on the other hand, were excellent. The meat was a rich mixture of minced beef and what I think was veal in an excellent marinara sauce. Truly tasted like ""moms marinara"". Service was pretty standard. I would say that this restaurant is better than most in the area so def check it out!"

Soft, creamy burrata, nice pesto and pepper accompaniment, and delicious focaccia. The margherita pizza was okay - very doughy - but the two entrees we had were both huge letdowns. The gnocchi was soft, mushy, and relatively bland despite looking nice with the charred cheese on top, and the rigatoni ala vodka was a bit too al dente (coming from someone who likes al dente) and had just a taste that something was a bit off - so the burrata and pizza ended up being the bulk of our meal.  The decor is dated as well inside the restaurant. We were very excited to try Nizza based on the photos, but ultimately walked away disappointed (and still hungry)"

The Italian restaurant has such potential with ample outdoor seating, space, and a full bar but unfortunately the interior decor specifically the tables and flooring make it look like a diner. Service was extremely slow especially considering the restaurant only had about 30% of tables full. I would recommend the pizza (ordered the pepperoni) - the dough is extremely soft and cooked to perfection. The Cacio e Pepe pasta was a bit bland and needed a ton of salt for flavor. The chicken Parm was very fried and served with a bed of pasta."

The food was great, the service excellent and we absolutely loved the outdoor seating arrangement ! They have tables outside with heat lamps above , which actually keep you very warm and comfortable, even on an exceptionally cold day like today . The outside seating is not like other places where you essentially are outdoors but it is all enclosed , which in my mind defeats the whole purpose ! This is outdoors , with air flowing and effective heat. It was perfect!

After a small bite and it was horrible the Mgr said I will keep it on your bill just find something else to order. 15mins later after going basically saying why should I pay for something that horrible he then said with a fine. Fine. No charge and takes and leaves the plate still there. I said. No thanks. You can have it back.

32,1HBtCnBGBYoq3zaQUxTbmg,9/29/2020,3 star rating,"Delivery: . I ordered a $100 of sushi and sashimi and instead of bringing the food in separate containers they used one so it was a big unappetizing blob of fishThe Good: The sushi and sashimi are just fine and I would rate them above average which is a credit to the sushi chef. Also - relevent for their re-opening - there are three large TV screens mainly showing sports for the people at the bar. The Bad: This is not a place that stresses friendliness to customers. If you go there nearly every day for the three or so since  it has been open you will not get a ""hello"" let alone a friendly word. I must have gone a 1000 times and each time it is as if it is my first. The manager doesn't give a nod and the service men and women change so often they don't know the customers. It is not there obligation to be friendly but a problem with the switching of the wait staff is that the waiter you get won't know the menu any more than you will after you read it. Advice: Service is slow even when the restaurant is empty but it is a little faster at the bar,  so unless the TV bothers you (and they might change the channel if you ask them, or not) sit at the bar for faster service."

Fish tastes fresh, and the prices are reasonable. My boyfriend has ordered the chirashi and liked it. The portion sizes are pretty good. The servers are friendly and quick but don't rush your meal. I love that they have outdoor seating. The atmosphere inside is also nice but not too fancy. They also have happy hour drink specials which I believe are 5-7pm M-F, but it may last until 8."

My favorite was the miso soup. It was a great portion size and had very good flavor. I ordered through Seamless and the delivery guy was a complete idiot. He could not figure out what building I was and when he called me he spoke ZERO English. It took about 10 minutes for him to figure out he was in the wrong building (the building next to mine). When he dropped the food off he had the nerve to ask for MORE tip! Totally rude. Otherwise food was good and came relatively quickly. I would order again but maybe not trough Seamless."
37,1HBtCnBGBYoq3zaQUxTbmg,12/4/2017,4 star rating,"So, so, so glad we found Sushi Gama considering the main reason why we ended up here was through Yelp search: ""omakase,"" ""Open now: Sunday 4pm,"" ""Upper Eastside."" It was my last meal before flying back home, and it definitely ended my NY trip with a bang. For $60 dollars, you get 11 pieces of nigiri and a hand roll. There was a great variety of fish. Everything was good but there were some pieces that really blew us away:-O toro with gold flake was so buttery, smooth, fatty. - Hamachi with truffle smelled so good, the guy sitting a few bar seats away from us could smell it. - Fatty salmon with scallop was ridiculously fatty, it basically dissolved in my mouth upon first taste. If you're looking for a solid omakase that won't cost you your first born child, then look no further!"

42,Xk3BVvlX-KXh6kJhbClMKw,1/15/2023,2 star rating,"I am torn about the stars that I have to give this place because the ambiance is really chill, and pleasant. We made reservations for 7:00 pm, and when we walked in we were lead to the back lounge. We ended up there for about two hours. So much for a time limit. We sat down, and the seats were comfortable, the room was intimate and dimly lit. Unfortunately, it took about 25 minutes to actually be seen by a waiter. Slowly people rolled in and there was no one to be found from the staff. We asked if we could be served about two times before someone came from the staff. The server seemed frustrated with us most the time, didn't check on us and throughout the dinner we were left wondering if he would ever come back. We were the first ones seated and the last ones served. They charge for still water. So, just keep that in mind. It's $9 whole dollars. On the bright side, it's a little less than half the drinks on the menu. We ordered our drinks and the old fashioned was absolutely delicious. You can choose the type of whiskey and the type of smokiness you want. It also has a good presentation. The whiskey drink had more service than anything else in the menu. If I was only going for the ambience and whiskey, I would understand the 4 1/2 stars. The whiskey drinks were great. Other drinks, not so much. Streak was dry. I ordered medium and it was medium well. Very salty and too much pepper. The food took so long that everything was lukewarm. The carrots were actually tasty and I liked the caramelization. The mashed potatoes were cold and sad. The Brussels sprouts were soggy and wet for no reason. For the prices I expected a lot more. I feel like I could have gotten a better meal at Taco Bell. Per my friends: The Kale salad is apparently very amazing, so there's that. The golf ball size burrata was a let down. The gnocchi was burned. The scallops were ""pretty good."" However, the polenta was watery with canned peas. My friend has an allergy and it appeared that one item on her dish had a food that she's allergic to which was strange because she was very clear about her allergies. That was concerning.The waiter was aware of the allergies and the chef claimed there was no onion on the plate. The waiter warned - it has onion. So, kudos to the waiter for that. The music is a mix between house and jazz. Well, just house.... And, a sprinkle of jazz. They had a jazz musician present, but then played house most the time. I was disappointed because the jazz musician only played about six or seven songs.  He had been complaining before playing his set about the crowd. We went for jazz and I heard more jazz at the Karaoke bar I ended up at the end of the night.So, all in all - don't come here unless you only want whiskey, house music and romantic candlelight. Don't hope for jazz and the bathroom - be prepared to take a flashlight with you and shake it off (no toilet paper). My meal was $130 - it's not the price that bothers me. It's the fact that my meal tasted like it was reheated in a microwave, that I felt like I was imposing by my mere presence and that I was invisible more than half the time."

48,Xk3BVvlX-KXh6kJhbClMKw,12/9/2022,3 star rating,"So disappointed. My go to menu item was the burger. They changed and ruined it. Rather than coming with bacon and egg, it's all a la carte. The problem is when you order the bacon, they literally bring you a side of bacon instead of adding thin strips of bacon to the burger. On top of that, the bacon was all fat and the fries did not come with the truffle aioli. Since it's all a la carte, what used to be $28 cost me over $40. The menu stated the price of the bacon was $5, but when the bill came, we got charged $12!!! If the burger had been good or better than the original,  I wouldn't have minded the price increase given inflation. My mom's risotto came out cold. If we hadn't purchased another scotch bottle tonight, we probably wouldn't return. To top it all off, we found out that the great and lovely manager Dasha left the place. It is no wonder this was such a different experience from the past. At this point, it is clear they are catering to clueless tourists rather than regulars."

The new egg white flatbread is tasty, but their coffee tops did not seem to fit perfectly for some reason, causing drips.Alot of people sitting seemed to have been there for a long time, possibly just passing the time."
52,8YHVLDued93Mgf9TXAitcw,8/8/2014,1 star rating,"By far the worst DD I've been to. Slowest service ever with only one cashier open when 7-8 people are waiting to give their orders. I was giving this location another try since the first time i came here, one of the staff was busy on her phone texting while another staff member was taking orders alone. He asked for some help and she replied ""You don't help me when I need it"" so she continued to do her own thing as me and my 5 friends were waiting 10+ minutes for a simple scoop of ice cream. Take your money elsewhere people! Worst service ever."

55,8YHVLDued93Mgf9TXAitcw,2/11/2014,4 star rating,"This Dunkin' Donuts is quite better than the ones I live near. It is a tad bit larger than what I would consider an average Dunkin' Donut establishment would be sized. The food and coffee and drinks are all great and prepared to perfection. I come here every now and then, and each time was as good as the next.The food is great. Not flawless, just great. I mean, there are a bit downs about some of the food, but they're mostly all things you wouldn't notice nor care to notice. I just like me a good cup of coffee, or maybe a good ol' latte. The food quality is excellent. My stomach is content.The service is alright, I guess. Just your typical Dunkin' Donuts service, is all. Sometimes it's great, usually it's just average, sometimes it gets a bit fuzzy, and then, every month or so, there's a time when you get plain frustrated at the guy behind the counter and feel like you want to strangle him. In other words, typical for a Dunkin' Donuts. Go figure. But that's just me and my luck. The service tends to be slow, but I guess the great beverage and food quality compensates for that.The hygiene is noticeable- and I say that in a good way. This Dunkin' Donuts is pretty clean, I must say. It stands out on top of every Dunkin' Donuts I have ever been in the hygienic game. So that's a big up, am I right?This place is generally not a bad place at all. Definitely one of the better Dunkin' Donuts I've ever been to. Because of the tendency of slow service, you will stumble across lines. Many of them. But it's not much of a problem, because it's usually no more than a minute and a half wait. This place got four and a half stars. I deducted a half star due to the frequent slow service, but it's not that big of a problem.Fresh, hygienic, top quality, what else can I say? It's a great Dunkin' Donuts. Don't hesitate to come here at all, just walk in the door and let them do their magic."

They're always cleaning the tables or restocking the napkin area which I never seen at any other location. I never had an issue with my order. They have at least 3 people behind the counter and always accommodate my order if I ask for something out the ordinary."

My donut to get is a chocolate glaze.  I have good customer service every time I went there. The place has always been clean and organized. I have yet to try their ice-cream.

Ordered a big and toasted with no cheese and he gave me a grilled cheese. Thinking he just heard me wrong i decided to give it another try, ordered the same sandwich and he gave me a plain Bacon sandwich. Also wanted to ordered a ice latte and he said he cant make it at this time. Very incompetence employee."

I've noticed prices of happy hour have increased quite alot (thanks to inflation of course), what I was not please was quality of our drinks, old fashioned was overtly sweet and spritzer was watered down. the decor is white and beachy theme, w nice lighting ambiance of using edison bulbs. It's a good first date spot if you don't much about quality of the drinks."

We were seated quickly and our waitress was such a doll (Hey Rachel!) there are a lot of interesting drinks on the cocktail menu and our waitress helped us pick which would be best for me. The menu is small but everything I tried was delicious. Great spot if you're looking for a small quick bite, great drinks and even better music! Would love to come back when they have the live music and dancing."

I absolutely LOVE that they give you with complementary popcorn. Popcorn is one of my favorite snacks, and their popcorn had just the right amount of olive oil and salt drizzled over it. I came with a group for happy hour, and it was the perfect place for us. The drinks were great and the snacks even better. We ordered $1 oysters (you have to order at least six, but after that you can order in whatever weird quantity you desire) and the Belly Fries. The oysters were pretty tiny, but they were a dollar, so I feel like it's an okay trade-off. The fries were amazing though. They were so crispy and well-seasoned. We ended up getting two orders--and they're a pretty decent size to begin with. Will definitely be back for some more wine, fries, and oysters!"

The bar staff not only made great drinks but engaged our group fully. Did not get the sense that they were overwhelmed at all. Great selection of liquor, too. Will definitely be coming back! The atmosphere was upscale but chill. Ginn was our fab waitress."
66,m3UPWf08TA6XbJcfC9QbPQ,10/18/2020,5 star rating,"Truly one of my favorite bars, especially during Covid. They've managed to fully transfer the indoor vibe to the outside seating area and it feels really lively and cozy. Happy hour from 5-7, $1 oysters (I think all day Saturday?), good drinks and good bar bites. The truffle popcorn they bring out before you order is... incredible. Love the fries and proscuitto wrapped melon, and they make a solid old fashioned.Decently spaced out tables, heaters (vital) now that it's getting cold, and waiters wearing masks.Really can't get enough of this bar!"
67,m3UPWf08TA6XbJcfC9QbPQ,11/9/2022,3 star rating,"Loved the cozy dimly lit ambiance, but the happy hour prices were outrageous for the severely watered down drinks you get."
68,m3UPWf08TA6XbJcfC9QbPQ,8/31/2021,4 star rating,"Weird that the rating is less than 4 stars - I've been here a couple times and had a good experience both times. It's a nice, intimate feeling spot with a decent amount of space between tables and dim lighting. Most recently, my friend and I shared the delicious burrata salad, watermelon and feta salad, and the impossible burger sliders. It was really nice they had the Impossible sliders as the friend I went with is a vegetarian - this was really easy spot for her to eat.It's nothing mindblowing, but it's definitely above average."
69,m3UPWf08TA6XbJcfC9QbPQ,7/28/2021,4 star rating,"Open and feels like pre-COVID. I like the drinks off happy hour more but the happy hour oysters are the real pull here. I would recommend going if you're an oyster fan. The fries are okay and the service is difficult if you're in the back. I actually had to get up and walk up to a server to order twice, once for me and once when a friend joined a bit late, which was rather annoying because they were taking orders from people around us but not our table. It felt like we were forgotten multiple times."

The pork tasted rotted and the fish was rubbery and discolored. We both stopped eating the meat and opted to only eat the noodles. The sauce on mine was so oily I couldn't keep eating it.We got excited when we saw the cheap prices and meat options, but it was not edible and left us with upset stomachs.Came in late night on a Saturday with no one else there, but the place only has 3 tables and a benchNo bills over $20 and a $10 credit card Will not come back and don't not recommend anyone to go"

I got really excited because I saw that they served Ramen and I've been dying to try it. From the looks of the spot I could tell they served Authentic Asian food, loved the vibe very warm and Cosy. The server was very nice and the seafood ramen was so yummy my boyfriend got the beef ramen and enjoyed it as well but the seafood ramen was hands down the best ! Will definitely come back again"

Cute little ramen place that seats roughly a dozen people. One friend and I decided on the lunch special. She got the Shoyu Ramen + beef curry rice on the side and I got the Shoyu Ramen and Pork Shumai (another option was gyoza)..$13/$14. The Pork Shumai was okay. The given sauce was in a cute little star dip plate, but it was way too salty.The ramen broth was okay, but that's just it...the whole thing was meh okay. The pork was a bit dry so I had to dunk it in the broth for a while before chewing. The bamboo shoots seemed a bit soggy. I'm not sure if it's just what I got, but it did not really meet my expectations in terms of taste. :("
75,vUZTHdPWqTCkj3g93D6CNQ,6/11/2018,4 star rating,"Today I ordered the duck rolls and the the pork noodle dish, ""Zah Jiang Men."" I didn't love the noodle dish. It had tons of noodles, little meat, no veggies, lots of sauce. It was okay, but I won't order that again"
76,vUZTHdPWqTCkj3g93D6CNQ,9/21/2016,5 star rating,"I really enjoyed having dinner here recently. Our server was very polite and he was very attentive. The restaurant is small, but I consider it cozy. The salmon sashimi tasted extremely fresh. The entrees we choose were different ramen noodles, and the entrees came with a side of miso soup. Also tried a side of bamboo, it was good, but I liked it better when I put some wasabi and soy sauce on it and the veggie gyoza. Along with dinner my date and I tried the J-Pop grapefruit beverage, the plum sake (in a tilted, funny glass), and a bottle of refreshing sparkling sake - all of which were a nice accompaniment to the meal. I have to add that the ramen dishes were so filling, that I had to take leftovers home and it was still really good the next day (especially since my seafood one marinated nicely in the sauce)."
77,vUZTHdPWqTCkj3g93D6CNQ,10/27/2018,4 star rating,Got a gomoku ramen and would say it was a big portion for just $9. The broth is thick and reminds me a gravy I had with noodles from the chinese restaurant. Service was decent and is a pretty small restaurant. Overall it's a good price in the area with the quality and quantity of the food.

I have advanced to the seafood ramen at the time, unbelievable!I come here mainly due to the VIP vibe, as in when I come, no one is here, I get the whole spot to myself and whoever I bring. I do come at odd times but cuz I know what I'm doing. It's the broth!"
79,vUZTHdPWqTCkj3g93D6CNQ,2/26/2019,5 star rating,"It is a hobby for a New Yorker to slurp far and wide and critique the infinite ramen choices. I have come to see it like wine: sure, anyone can drop $50 and get a good wine, but the real skill is finding a great wine at a good price. I continue to be disappointed or underwhelmed by hip and hyped ramen places. This place serves you a solid bowl (and a great lunch special) at a good price and good tunes to match, without the bullshit of a lot of other places. They just added tonkotsu to the menu so, eat your heart out, ramenheads!"

The first time was, my friend had placed her order and were waiting there for 30 min.! So my friend asked the lady, the lady got really bad attitude. She was complaining she had called the number and we were not there. Which clearly she did not call the number because we were standing right there waiting for the food. The second time was today, I had placed my order and ready to paid, I was going to use the deal from the app, but this b* looks at the QR code and done nothing ! It cost like 21 something, and I gives her 22. This b* did not give me back the rest of my change. Which I didn't bother to ask after, cause I was not in a mood to get into a fight with her! Really bad experience, and would not go back ever again! If u don't want ur day to be ruin, just don't walk in to this place"

Everyone was moving around like snails. Literally counting out loud every nugget that they put in the box. It was like they were trying to piss people off.

I had a really bad stomach ache and needed to use the restroom, and I went here from the subway down below. The bathroom was kept clean constantly and I really like that. (Who wouldnt...?) There were two toilets, and they had toilet paper in both (yay!)My friend and I didn't order much, just some cookies, and the cashier was okay. He had a bit of an attitude when I asked him if they had any more chocolate chip cookies, and that was it. I mean I know I could've just said I wanted the cookies but then what if there weren't any more? ._."

Fries were cold + sandwich was cold. Should just start cooking at home. Why spend $10 on ice cold food?  Floor was greasy. They don't shake the fries when they come out of the oil. They just pour them into the bin.  What's with the music???? And the inappropriate lyrics? Geez there's young kids there. Put me in the worse mood. Is there a taco bell or Wendy's nearby?

86,oXVZ9OqrC55fp-3hDBvRCQ,6/23/2014,4 star rating,"Due to its location in the mall, you can expect a full house or large lines.  The restaurant is poorly constructed so it will seem like there's one line, but you'll soon hear from one of the cashiers that there are three lines. Thankfully, they move pretty quickly and have a system that works. You place your order on your right and pick it up on the left. Bon appetit!"
87,oXVZ9OqrC55fp-3hDBvRCQ,2/16/2008,1 star rating,"This review is specifically about the McDonalds in the Atlantic Mall on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. This is by far the worst managed fast food restaurant in the country. Because of it's small size compared to other McD's, you would think the manager of this one would recognize the importance of organized service. Though kids will love it here (mainly because it's so zoo like), adults will tear up and long for the good old days when customers were important and not treated like cattle. The cashier's all have major attitude problems, as if they are looking for a fight!. All I want is a friggin fish samich for Pete's sake!Run upstairs to Target to their Starbucks for something to tide you over until you can get home, but stay away from this McNightmare."
88,oXVZ9OqrC55fp-3hDBvRCQ,8/31/2011,1 star rating,"McDonald's is one of the many reasons why I detest the Atlantic Mall.  Usually, I end up at McD's because I didn't eat anything before shopping and I refuse to pay for Applebees.  Or, I'm waiting for the LIRR train and as usual, I didn't eat before I have to travel.Tonight, I was just shoppng at my new guilty pleasure, Target.  Going down the elevator, I knew I had to eat something and I resigned myself to McDonalds.   I look at the menu and when I was finally called, I told the worker what I wanted.  ""The McDouble is not a dollar, we don't have a dollar menu"" said he.  I snottily told him that I didn't ask him if it was a dollar, I want my damn McDouble, hop to it.    He did not hop, he crawled over to the soda machine and with an air of resignation, looked at the other people working.   The drugs I'm taking for my sinus infection must be really good because I thought the whole scene was hilarious.  Loud little children, shrieking, trying to be cute and annoying the hell out of me were there.   I got my food and sat down near some white kids, one asian and one of the white girls' mom.    Those little yuppie bitches was eyeing people up and down.  OH my gawd, we are in a ghetto enclave!   I rolled my eyes as I looked at the expressions of snobbish fear played on their faces.  Those little wenches were ordering their mother around, I wanted to slap them in the faces and tell them to get shit their own damn self and that their mother wasn't there to cater to their every whim.  That woman was frazzled.   While this was happening, I'm eating my McDouble.    It was GOOD!  I was really surprised.   It was the best tasting McDouble I have ever had.The neighbor hood has changed.  All neighborhoods surrounding the Atlantic Mall are gentrified or almost on their way.  It's going to be interesting how this pans out.   Atlantic Mall is now an excellent place to observe the changes in the community.   As far as McDonald's goes, well if enough Yuppies go there and complain, we'll be having a well run McDonalds."

We were visiting from Miami and my partner had never been so we went specifically for the cocktails. They don't make old fashions which was disappointing, but the Manhattan wasn't bad. The food reminded me of TGIFriday's...satisfying, but nothing to brag about. EXCEPT the vegetable tempura. That was soooo delicious. The staff is never really friendly or attentive, but they get the job done. I can also say that the amount of food given is always appreciated. It's an NYC staple, so I'm sure I'll be back at some point, but no rush."

We usually get the chicken soup, which is one of the best chicken soups I've had. It comes with plenty of chicken, carrots, celery, potatoes and corn. The flavor of the soup is also so good. Sometimes we will just pick up the soup and not get anything else. The chicken fingers are also very good. We also had the Mac and cheese recently and it is great. Very creamy and cheesy. We also really enjoy the bbq pork and brisket sandwich. I would probably skip on the onion tower since it's pretty greasy. Overall, I would recommend delivery."

This Dallas BBQ's was one of my all-time favorites but I was completely disgusted with what I saw an experienced today. Flies all over the place . Flies on the windows inside. On my table while I ate and flying around during my meal. We had to change seats prior to receiving our food. The new seating area had even more flies. Since it was a family outing and the children were so excited to visit Bbqs we opted to stay. Needless to say they should shut this place down while they fumigate. Flies carry germs and have no place in an eating establishment. I can't imagine how they remain open. I give So long BBQ'S.
94,Hh_qqWLqWOgj_i3vit5wdw,1/30/2022,2 star rating,Called for delivery- food was just ok. Nothing special. Maybe it just doesn't travel well? Will not be ordering from here again. I would rather buy a rotisserie chicken from my local grocery store than eat here. This place used to better- not sure what caused the decline of food quality and flavor.
95,Hh_qqWLqWOgj_i3vit5wdw,9/16/2019,5 star rating,Food was amazing here. The portions were huge. Definitely come here with a hungry crowd. This was my first time here & I was surprised at how much food was served. Each place could have been shared by at least 2 to 3 people. Went here with a large crowd & everyone raved about their meal. I ordered the spinach & quinoa salad since I wasn't so hungry. It was huge & really good. The dressing was my favorite. My second favorite was the fried onion appetizer. My kids loved the wings. Overall we had a great experience. I didn't see any desserts on the menu which was odd. Warning: this place was really crowded & loud. My party was just as loud so it wasn't a problem. Even with the crowd I feel the restaurant was kid friendly.  The women's  bathroom was tiny. Two stalls & they were micro. I'm 7 months pregnant 5ft tall about 125lbs & had a hard time in the stall.

All the servers are surly and don't care. They're also not covid safe. Sanitizing is non existent. Bathroom is filthy with no cleaning. I witnessed the bus person cleaning tables between customers by wiping down with a dirty rag sans sanitizing spray. Plates and utensil we had to exchange twice because they had dried old food on them. Skip this place

I also want to thank Charlie the manager, who was NOT bothered to hear what we had to say about OUR server Bryan, who in fact stated to us that this young man was a GREAT WORKER!!!

I prefer to wait until I return the second time just in case I ordered wrong or they were having a off day. I had chicken meal. It was pretty tasteless to me. My daughter said I don't know how to order. I give up. There's nothing memorable about my lunch here. I haven't returned. I felt I wasted money on a lousy meal. The food was so unappealing I didn't take photos at the time. You'll have to try eating here yourself. I'd love to see more opinions before I give it a try again!

It is dirty, the food is old and the manager is just rude. I wonder how they can stay open like this. Too bad, it was great. I would never set foot in there again."

I also like the fact that you can watch them make the food behind the counter- pretty cool. The food was made fairly quickly as well and the staff was nice. I ordered one of their lunch boxes which had beef, rice, fried wontons and mini egg rolls. It was pretty good for the most part. The beef and rice was the best part. In any case, I recommend stopping in!"

A colleague picked up lunch and my order was DROWNED in salt.  I took a spoon of rice and literally had to spit it back out!!!! I can only chalk what I tasted to being an accident bc there is NO WAY someone could accidentally pour that much salt on a dish, but the audacity to STILL serve it is what I am confused about.  It was not just a salty dish, It literally tasted as if I poured salt a pile of salt into my hand and licked it off.  I call, they tell me to bring it back, this is a work day during what is only supposed to be a lunch hour.   I was allowed to step out to get my order fixed bc everyone felt bad. I was offered nothing for the inconvenience, my troubles or the mishap with the salt.  I wasn't going to leave a review but as I'm sitting here I am getting a headache!!!!!!  This is unacceptable!!!!   Ok beyond this incident this BBQ's has fell off as time passed. It always looks pretty filthy.  Bathroom is embarrassing.   The dining area is gloomy and the floors always look as it seriously needs to be vacuumed!!  The tables are sticky and sometimes smelly from being wiped down with an old dirty cloth.   I've gone to the BBQ's in queens and it is so much more inviting, clean and cheerful!  This place downtown needs to CLOSE or remodel and hire new management!

It was a short walk from my hotel in Downtown Brooklyn. Upon arrival and after showing proof of vaccination, we were immediately seated. The service was very prompt and the server (sorry I don't remember her name) was attentive. She along with my guy recommended drinks to try and he decided to Texas-size plus Royale it (included Rose' Moscato+shooter)  which was an excellent thing to do! Those drinks were FIRE!!Because I'm mostly vegetarian and 1-2 days/wk, I'm a pescatarian, I was on a cheat day and he ordered fried shrimp, yellow rice, coleslaw, and cornbread for me- I think it was a combo. At any rate, the food was piping hot and we didn't have to wait forever to get it. I'm from Atlanta, so I was surprised there was cornbread (not Jiffy for sure, but a little sweetness) and it was tasty LOL! Also, the coleslaw didn't have an overpowering vinegar taste, so that's always a good thing. He selected chicken and waffles and said he enjoyed it especially since some restaurant he'd previously been to served what looked to be Eggo waffles with some chicken tenders on top (well, that wasn't real chicken and waffles LOL).I'll definitely be back and can't say enough about those drinks!!!

I opted for Dallas BBQs because it was the best quick option nearby. I figured Dallas BBQs is Dallas BBQs. WRONG!I was given a number on a raffle ticket and told 10-15 minute wait. I was called in less than 5 minutes. Awesome right? No! Once I was seated, a waiter didn't come by for another 15 minutes. She quickly took our order and put it in. About 7 minutes later, all our food was on our table. Although I didn't see much of her, our waiter was polite. ANGRY shrimp, 10 Hennessy wings, come slaw, and fries. One henny colada; no straw. I stopped a random waiter because our waiter was nowhere to be found. He didn't have a straw to give us either. Now we had to wait to ask someone else- who also didn't have a straw but was very kind to find someone WITH a straw to give us. The henny wings were doused in so much sauce it was overwhelming and not really tasty. Coleslaw was a little bit dry. Fries were fine. Angry shrimp was also way way way saucy. This place was a wreck. The floor was filthy. It didn't help that the lighting in this place was very dim which made it look worse. I didn't see my waiter again until it was time to go. That took another 10 minutes for her to return with the check. Blah- wouldn't ever go back here."

They clearly state ""fresh fruit"" but actually use a sugary purée :(4. I watched the cook use tongs to put raw chicken on the grill then use the exact same tongs a second later to remove cooked chicken.5.

The space is incredibly small and intimate, but the restaurant gets very loud. All the tables are basically pushed right next to each other, so if you go on a busy day with one or two large groups, you've already filled up most of the restaurant. Service was decent, though we waited a pretty long time for the waiters to take our order (even though we saw them talking to each other and looking at their phones and looking everywhere except in our direction). After that, service was good for the rest of the dinner. All of the food tasted good and pretty fresh. We ordered the grilled octopus (always love to order this at Greek restaurants), Souvlaki plate, and Fish of the Day (branzino). The octopus was extremely tender and flavorful and was my favorite meal here. The souvlaki was pretty good, but eating a long, skinny chunk of souvlaki was an interesting experience. Lastly, we enjoyed the fish, but since branzinos usually tend to be very fresh at Greek restaurants, I personally would have preferred it to be grilled and not fried. Overall, a fairly pleasant dining experience but would definitely check out some other Greek restaurants in Astoria the next time I return to the area!"

We walked by yesterday and saw that there was a good deal of outdoor seating and a lot of tasty-looking food, so we decided to grab a table for dinner. The vibe here is rather old school: very fairly-priced, traditional Greek fare, and lots of families and older patrons, though there were diners of all ages. Ultimately, we enjoyed a satisfying, well-executed, if not mind-blowing dinner. I ordered the branzino, which is their most popular fish dish but which is oddly off-menu. It was nicely cooked in the traditional Greek style: grilled, with lemon, olive oil, and a touch of parsley. The seasoning was altogether pretty light. My partner ordered the salmon, which came with a side of lemon potatoes and squash. I only had a bite of the salmon but ate more of the veggies. The lemon potatoes were good, not as citrusy or oiled as some other versions. The service was friendly, but it did seem like we were kind of forgotten about after a while.With our dinners and beers (Fix, a Greek lager), tax, and tip, the total was only a little over $62."

Garlicky tart potatoes with a tasty chewy skin.  The fried eggplant and zucchini had a crisp outside and a juicy inside, but was not greasy.  Well seasoned with a garlic mashed potato (served Greek style, not southern style) in the middle.  I was also given a complimentary little desert.  Should also be noted they serve complimentary bread with a spread (plums? Raisins?  Something both sweet and savory).  Large portions, could easily buy plates and share.  The menu is expansive, with lots of appetizers, fish dishes, souvlaki, gyros, and even crab cakes and baby shark.  Service and food both excellent, in a vibrant, diverse neighborhood."

It's not the fanciest place but my nephew loves the place, so my dads decided to go there. Because of my nephew we became quite the regulars here.We ordered 4 glasses of ice water and a cup of tea for my dad. The waiter/bus boy put my dads hot tea and 2 cups of ice water on the table and then his tray toppled and the 2 glass cup of ice water fell on my back and soaked my entire back and pants and everything shattered.Another waiter came out to see what the ruckus is about and said oh lucky it's only water, not too bad. When my pants and shirt is dripping of water. He said we feel so terrible let me give you a free house sake. When none of us drink alcohol. I didn't expect a free meal or anything but at least offer apps on the house or a 10-20% discount? Waiter started recommending their ""best"" apps saying we must try it like it's on the house but of course it wasn't and was charged in full minus the 5 dollars for the house sake.

185,bE3BudqaNQsuInFefCTl8A,4/14/2019,2 star rating,The Nest is really great place with one major design flaw. They never have sugar containers available for customers to use. When I ask for light and sweet it is never sweet enough. A simple fix would be for me to grab an easily available sugar container and sweeten my cappuccino to my liking. Unfortunately they have no containers and force you to ask the nice lady at the counter for sugar packets. This gets very annoying when it happens on every visit and I have to cut customers to get her attention for sugar packets. NEST MANAGEMENT please leave some sugar and cinnamon containers out for your customers to use . Otherwise this place is great.

I was craving chinese for a long time, and I decided to have a taste. The prices here are cheap and they have typical dishes served at every other little chinese restaurant. The workers were professional and nice. The food came out quickly and the service was outstanding. After getting home, I wanted to eat right away. I ordered chicken and broccoli, my go-to dish for trying new chinese places. First thing I noticed was that the food looked VERY different. It wasn't like other places where you would just get cheap over-greased food. This chicken looked baked and glazed with a different type of sauce (much better!) and everything looked steamed rather than fried and over-sauced. This place is different from other places and if you want quality food, definitely drop by! As I'm typing this, I am waiting until this place opens to go and order chicken and string beans lunch special. I will add a photo in later!"

192,PgiqzwIfcV2eruGmNx77lw,4/3/2010,4 star rating,"Can't complain about the food. Honestly though the only non-spicy things I've tried off this menu are the egg roll and steamed dumplings. Both are good. The only problem is the sauce. They give you one of each you ask for and then if you say ""extra"" they give you one more. I'd never eat inside, it's only three booths and one is always occupied by one of the workers. Really can't beat the lunch specials or the combo platters (which are served all day)."

Instead I received a mess of celery doused in sauce with bits of chicken thrown in. I called the restaurant, and they insisted that this is what I ordered, and then hung up on me. I'm Chinese, and ""mein"" is noodles in Chinese, so I don't understand how they can send a dish labeled noodles with no noodles in the dish. I called back after he hung up on me, and he rudely insisted that this is what I ordered, and would not give me a refund or send a replacement. The only way I could get a refund is if I walked to the store and brought the dish back, which is ridiculous because Seamless is a delivery service. The only way I got my refund was by calling Seamless, who informed me that they wanted to come back to get the dish. Still waiting for them to make good on that promise."

195,PgiqzwIfcV2eruGmNx77lw,11/11/2009,4 star rating,"I order from here at least once a week and since I discovered their hand-rolled, not too doughy, steamed shrimp dumplings, it's been more like 3 times a week. I'm half Chinese and these shrimp dumplings are the closest thing to the real deal for a hole in the wall, take out & delivery Chinese place. The veggie and pork dumplings are those fat, doughy ones. Their mei fun is good but inconsistent from day to day and their sesame tofu is delicious. The scallion pancakes are a little dry but it's better than it being soaked in oil which I've gotten at other places. If you get the udon soup, ask them to put an egg in there, it makes the broth nice and thick. Also, I think you get 1 free soda for every $10 you spend so specify your choice if you don't want something random. Cheap and yummy."

197,lIXVm16VchbDXOf7v4hxMA,12/2/2019,3 star rating,"So my last review of this place was about 3 years ago, wow. Back then, they were pretty shitty and I think they got closed down by the DOH even for a time. I didn't know they were open again and because I parked a block away one late night after hanging out with friends and really hungry, I weighed my options of food in the area or on the way home and will always decide on Indian if given the option.Curry in a Hurry was nearby, but that place was trash last time I went (see my review of them on their page), and Haandi actually this time seemed like the only beckoning light from within that looked decent. Figured I'd stop in and if the food didn't look good I'd unapologetically leave.Here's what I liked and didn't like. And maybe this was because it was on a lonely Saturday night the weekend of Thanksgiving when the MidWesterners went home for the holiday weekend, so they had some more fresh or extra food hanging out, but I got lamb curry, chicken tikka masala spicy rice chick peas & eggplant and naan and it was actually very good. 3 stars (and not 4 or 5) because they did scoop from the pre-made tray and microwave it. I was concerned for my toilet bowl the next day after seeing that but by the grace of God I did not have any of those issues. The sauce was pretty hearty, the chicken slightly dry although passable, and the lamb was actually meaty, not cheap and full of cartilage like usual from these types of places. Also value- all of that for $9. Two meats, a vegetable, salad and naan. Not bad. So I suppose my advice is this- stop in, but check out the food before ordering. Maybe I was there on a good night when the ""good"" chef was working the stove. But this is a step in the right direction. If I come back again and get a similar experience they may even make it to 4 stars."

It was not on the menu, but I was promptly told by a nice lady that if I called in a formal order they could cook it up for me Punjabi style. Haandi is by no means a fine dining establishment. If you want to do a Haandi date, order in and literally watch Netflix. If you want booze, there is a liquor store next store, downstairs.  However, to keep it Halal, maybe skip the drinks and DIVE into an unbeatable lunch special. Looking forward to my ""last meal"" dinner here!"
199,lIXVm16VchbDXOf7v4hxMA,12/2/2020,4 star rating,Great place to get a myriad of curries from vegetarian to meats.  Decently priced in the area.  Naan was awesome!  Chicken is a bit dry but still very tasty.  The place is a bit dirty and dingy feeling from time to time but that's expected due to the amount of people coming in.
200,lIXVm16VchbDXOf7v4hxMA,4/2/2017,4 star rating,"Considered by many to be the crown jewel of curry hill, I had to make a special trip to Haandi in order to see what the big deal what this place is about. I discovered that it is indeed something special: a great indian/pakistani buffet for $10 including tax and tips.While this place technically opens at 10:00 AM, the buffet does not begin until 12:00 PM. They are quite specific about this, so I wouldn't bother showing up any earlier than 12, since they may not have fully set up the buffet table before then. However, keep in mind that as soon as you hit 12, the floodgates will open and tons of people will swarm in, so really do try to get here as close to 12 as possible without being too early.You may get confused by the upstairs/downstairs thing, but it's all the same restaurant. While you're allowed to sit anywhere, but the buffet is served downstairs, while the cooked foods to order, drinks, and everything else is served upstairs. It's pretty informal here. Just go in, take a seat, and as soon as the buffet opens downstairs, go to get your food. Not one comes here or serves you or anything, and it's kind of strange how they keep a tab on what you're eating, but I'm pretty sure someone is watching/taking notice, so just go for it.The buffet, which is the claim to fame here, is quite good. As shown by some of my photos, this is where a lot of taxi drivers come to eat. I imagine because taxi drivers have to work long shifts, buffets make sense for them, and because this place has a super reputation, especially among Indian people, this is the right choice. The buffet is $10.00, POST TAX POST TIP, which is really just a mind boggling deal, considered so many of the other places offer at $11.99, $12.99 kind of deal. Not only is this impressive because the food here is so good, but also because it's been $10 for quite a few years now- judging by previous reviews left by other yelpers, it's been at this price point for around 2 years now.As alluded to, the food is quite good. It's not the best food in the world, or even the best Indian/pakistani food you can get in curry hill, but for what it is, it's damn good. They have rice, meat curries, vegetable curries, naan, a salad bar, a rice dessert... the selection actually isn't huge, but they have everything that you'd expect of a typical south asian place. THere isn't any tandori chicken included in the buffet (you may be able to get it at the counter), but it's not a huge constraining factor, since the chicken in the other dishes are very good.The biggest downside here is that it's not super clean. Even when I came in, where I was ostensibly the first buffet customer of the day, the table was still not very clean. Still, worth it. Also the mango lassi wasn't great, kind sour, and costs $2.99, which isn't much cheaper than any other mango lassis in the area. Next time I'll probably try the plain lassi.CC minimum of $15"

The stuff is absolutely disgusting, I'm sure if it was fresh it would be great but there was a nasty stench coming from the food like it has been sitting out all day or held on to for over a week. I will never order at the end of the day. The price does not make up for skimpy amount and lack of freshness. The packing was insanely oily, my white counter turned yellow trying to unpack from the grease spilling out and stuck to the bottom of their containers.Perhaps their cheap buffet might be a better option."

I always get the haleem, and it has never disappointed. Honestly, if they didn't serve anything else, I would be fine with it. Haha.The kabobs, rice, naan, and lassis are also consistently great. This time, the saag was not as on point as usual, but I'll give them a pass. I've been coming here for years, and like I said, the haleem is all I need."

I had a mushroom Asiago omelette and my friend had eggs florentine. I am super picky about omelettes, usually don't order them - but I had a good feeling & indeed and this one was just exactly right. My friend likewise has specifics about how he wants the eggs poached (whites firm) and they were able to do it exactly as requested. Cocktails were generous, coffee delicious too. Will be back!"

I've been here twice with friends for weekend brunches. If you call ahead of time, they are happy to accomodate larger parties. Each time, I was there with a party of 10+ people. The first time I went, I ordered the eggplant parm. It was pretty good, but not the best I've ever had. The second time I went, I ordered the ravioli in sage brown butter sauce, The portion size was good, and the sauce was delicious. As an appetizer each time, I ordered the tomato eggplant bruschetta, and it was really good as well. I really enjoyed the desserts. My top 3 favorites were the chocolate mousse, the tiramisu and the bread pudding. All of my friends, except one lactose intolerant friend, enjoyed this place. (If you're lactose intolerant, I recommend a different location as many of the dishes use cream or butter)."

Amazing drink, even at $6.50 for medium size.They use real taro instead of powder, which gives the drink more of a chunkier, almost smoothie-like texture.

I truly think their bubble tea is the best in the city thanks to the use of very fresh and high quality ingredients and their professional and passionate staff!Their Taro is my favorite because they use real taro instead of artificial powders used by other bubble tea places. Also, Jennifer and her team are very friendly and professional. They always make sure that bubble tea is well-made before passing it to their customers. Lastly, their catering service is beyond best! We used their catering service for our wedding and Jennifer and the team really went above and beyond! Every single guest of our wedding LOVED the bubble tea- to them, it was one of the highlights of the event! We cannot thank Tea and Milk enough for everything they did for us at our wedding.

Food looks amazing but thats all. I ordered garlic bread that costs 11$ thinking it would be good but it was absolutely disgusting. It was garlic with bread. Burned bread. It tasted like burnt bread with worst garlic imaginable. We also ordered cheese cake and it was literally frozen. It tasted like lemon. Only thing that was good was sprite with ice which they weren't able to mess up. It all was soo awful that it ruined our moods and we went home disappointed.            It was literal scam.

We also had a delicious carrot appetizer brought out to us which was very delicious. They also had a special limoncello lemonade which was a lovely addition to our meal on a summer night. Lastly we had the iced coffee with rumchata as dessert- amazing!! The only negative was things were a bit overpriced imo (but that's NY and every other restaurant on Mulberry) otherwise we were satisfied with our evening at Benito One!

My friend and I came here Saturday morning for brunch without making a reservation and were seated fairly quickly. There are a bunch of wooden tables and a few tables that were especially adorable with a built-in glass case that stored pieces of porcelain teacups and dishes. We both opted for the Tea & Scones combo, which comes with a pot of tea, two scones, and clotted cream and raspberry preserves. We decided to get four different scones to try as many flavors as possible: -strawberry with lemon glaze: vegan, highly recommended by our server, soft and crumbly texture with a hardened glaze on the outside, very sweet but it was my favorite! I even ordered an extra to take home with me :)-pumpkin caramel: had been super excited to try this one but the scone was unfortunately very dry and there wasn't a lot of caramel flavor-ham and chives: a really interesting savory scone! loved the flavor-mixed berry: seemed to have a similar base and texture as the strawberry with lemon glaze, just with more berries mixed in (probably the most ""typical"" flavor you'd expect)We also ended up getting the Hawaiian Paradise and Rose Sencha teas, both of which were quite lovely to sip in between taking taking bites of our scones. Also my heart literally melted as I watched some of the workers help these two little girls put on fairy wings and sprinkle glitter over them. Will definitely bring all my friends here when they visit the city."
249,kaSd6qzlsxn__ILDtGf3iA,12/11/2021,4 star rating,"I took my sister here to celebrate her birthday. We didn't have a reservation and came on a Saturday afternoon but surprisingly, there was only a 20 minute wait! The major draw of having high tea here is the ambiance. We were choosing between different tea spots and there are many with better pricing and better food, but she liked the tea parlor ambiance here. I definitely felt transported to the set of Alice's tea party from the movie. While waiting, we had admired the long selection of teas being offered and naturally chose the Mad Hatter Tea for Two so we could try unlimited tea. Actually, they only offer unlimited refills on the two teas you choose originally, but our server was so generous and allowed me to try one additional one as a courtesy. The teas were phenomenal and the most memorable part of the experience. I had the Rooibos Coconut Vanilla and the Green Tea Chai. I love milk tea, and had both of these with milk and honey. The food paled in comparison to the tea. We were allowed to choose three scones, two tea sandwiches, a pastry in addition to the assortment of cookies provided. The scones were MASSIVE. Each one was the size of a mug. I didn't really like the cheddar scone but the vegan lemon blueberry was scrumptious and the pumpkin chocolate chip was delicious as well. The sandwiches were awesome but this was the only savory component of the tea service and should have been more extensive in comparison to the sweets. The few slivers of smoked salmon and cucumber sandwiches we had were nothing compared to the mountains of sweets we ingested. Our mocha cake was moist and decadent, but the cookies were hard and way too sweet. For me, the whole experience was a little too expensive and overzealous with the amount of sweets provided. I would have appreciated more sandwiches as a substitute for the cookies or cake but there wasn't that option. Great service and tea, but I'd rather do my own tea service at home with some homemade sandwiches and scones."

Had it from almost every spot in Brooklyn and yes - the best pizza in the world is probably in Brooklyn..but it is not this location.There are a few pizza spots along 86st street and you can probably get a decent slice at the Pizza Den when those albanians aren't fighting each other, but if I were to choose the best of the worst it would probably be Lennys. The only thing consistent about this spot is that the quality of slices gets worse and worse as the price gets higher. To call it a mediocre ny slice is an insult. Last few times we ordered a pie it came half burned. Even the cheese was burned. Pulled a slice off and the cheese slid off like a leaf of paper. No pull.Ordered stuffed shells as an entree and the plate came with 3 shells. 3 shells for the price they charge is a joke.Came here recently to see if the food improved at all seeing as how COVID is crippling the food industry. Sad to say they did not dissapoint - food is still bland. Still trying to sell some BS merch, and still holding on to the memory Travolta.Also wtf happened to the chicken rolls?

And when we don't finish the pie in one sitting, it's still good the next day with a little reheating in the toaster oven. But if you're looking for a quick lunch, you can definitely snag a variety of slices for $2.50-4. Snazzy up your order with some add-ons: I'm also a fan of their garlic knots (four for $1.25) and the pepperoni pin wheel ($4). Lenny's isn't the best pizza in the city, but for Bath Beach, they have me coming back time and time again for their kind service and reliability."

Had it from almost every spot in Brooklyn and yes - the best pizza in the world is probably in Brooklyn..but it is not this location.There are a few pizza spots along 86st street and you can probably get a decent slice at the Pizza Den when those albanians aren't fighting each other, but if I were to choose the best of the worst it would probably be Lennys. The only thing consistent about this spot is that the quality of slices gets worse and worse as the price gets higher. To call it a mediocre ny slice is an insult. Last few times we ordered a pie it came half burned. Even the cheese was burned. Pulled a slice off and the cheese slid off like a leaf of paper. No pull.Ordered stuffed shells as an entree and the plate came with 3 shells. 3 shells for the price they charge is a joke.Came here recently to see if the food improved at all seeing as how COVID is crippling the food industry. Sad to say they did not dissapoint - food is still bland. Still trying to sell some BS merch, and still holding on to the memory Travolta.Also wtf happened to the chicken rolls? They used to actually be stuffed with chicken."

Always have a great time the music and jukebox are always up my ally. The backyard is a little oasis in the middle of Bushwick. Prosecco on tap why yes please. All my love to the staff and owners you guys are the best and can't wait to hang when you guys reopen!

Those are the three diamonds."

You don't go to American Eagle looking for strap-ons just like you don't go to a taqueria looking for authentic pho. This works the same with bars. If you want an overpriced cocktail with manufactured Gilded Age ambience, go to Death+Co. If you want to get drunk on High Life and hangout with irreverent maniacs, go to 3D. (As a side note - the bartenders are only surly if you're a mannerless ass pimple. Show some respect and it will be reciprocated.)"

283,FMvcl6xwy6EQOBEHDDkvzA,11/17/2018,1 star rating,"This has been the worst bar I've been in years. The way the bartenders treated was disrespectful and straight offensive. Throughout the night I was yelled by a specific emo-style bartender(woman). She was rude several times and had a shitty attitude. When the time to pay came, I asked for my tab to be closed. Of course I was not going to tip someone so disrespectful. Tips are earned, Bartenders/Waiters are not entitled to it. I wrote 0 on the tip section however I holded the bill waiting for a friend I had just met there before giving it back to the bartender. She called me an asshole for not giving her the bill straight away even though I politely told her 3 times I wasn't done with it. Eventually I gave her the bill just get called an asshole again but this time by other bartenders too. She even did a whole tantrum but throwing my half full beer just because I guess she can't control her emotions like a kid. The bouncer came and they forced me out because it looks like I was wrong in not tipping the most offensive service I've had in my life. And no, I didn't swear back or insulted them in any way, because there wasn't any point in doing so and just makes things worse. Especially with a bouncer right behind you.I guess thats what happens when people think tipping is entitled, they do a shitty job because they expect me to still give them my money. My new friend and I had planned to tip in CASH to other bartender(a tall guy, short hair with beard if I recall correctly) who was nice at first but after the tantrum of the female Bartender, he decided to side with her straight, call me an asshole too and told me to get the F out of the bar without letting me explain or say anything. Truly an awful bar.Edit: To further explain who this bartender was, she is a white woman with black semi long straight hair. Average height. The kind to use dark make up. If you ever come to this bar, go to the side where isn't working and avoid asking her anything, you'll regret it."

285,FMvcl6xwy6EQOBEHDDkvzA,12/30/2014,5 star rating,"I really liked this bar. First of all, it was cheap. They had Modelo on tap for $4 during happy hour. The bartender was attentive and friendly, though not big on small talk, which was perf because I hate small talk. There was a group of people having a dog birthday party, which I found very strange, but it's nice that dogs were allowed inside. It was a bit chilly (at least for a Texas girl) outside, but they looked to have a really great patio. They don't serve food, but allow  you to bring it in. Overall, if I ever find myself in the area again, I'll probably find myself back at this bar.Oh, I should note: I was really psyched about the prosecco on tap, and I specifically asked if there was no issue of it getting flat. The bartender said no and equated it to beer not getting flat which kind of makes sense. Anywho, the prosecco was flat. Not a big deal, but I wouldn't order it again."

Need to improve the customer service and not give a vibe as if you're being forced to be there.Also, most of their vegetables are not fresh.

Their weighted food is cafeteria quality at premium prices, and their groceries are embarrassingly expensive. I don't know who you're trying to cater to, but you should be ashamed for charging $9 for a PINT OF ICE CREAM. The owners are either desperate or delusional... but I implore you not to be."

And right around the corner on 5th Avenue is a great deli/mini-market for anything and everything you need during your stay.It's actually a pretty big space with a huge central area where they serve up pizza, sandwiches (the paninis are really good), all sorts of hot dishes and pastries. In the back is a huge refrigerated area for drinks and such. And there is a huge buffet area of hot food that they keep well stocked until about midnight. It's usually overcooked...but hey, did I mention it's open at all hours.There has been many a night when I was so wired and hungry that this was my salvation. They even have drug store items like cold tablets...and lots of bags of chips. And the guys who own the place are always nice..even to the panhandlers."

If you don't know what you want to eat this place pretty much has everything. Hot and cold food buffet bars, soups, salads, sandwiches, wraps, sushi, udon, snacks, etc. Seating area to grab a table and eat your bounty. Can get very crowded during lunch hour, but lines seemed to move fast.Their food bars are filled with a lot of fresh looking salads, fruits, prepared hot foods, and such. As you pay by weight be careful or you will end up mortgaging a small car on what you put in your tray. Lots of stuff to choose from."

Told them to please make an exception since I have a cold and needed just the soup and they refused, so I walked out. I don't think they understand the concept of good customer service.Stay away from this place."

I know what I gave him, but he said they will check the camera tomorrow. I just decided it wasn't worth it and left. BE CAREFUL, WATCH YOUR MONEY AND CHANGE!Also, the same cashier was a bit racist. I got the pre-made sushi rolls and then I asked for chopsticks, and he looked at me like I was crazy and said, ""You sure you no want fork?"" I told him ""NO, it's easier to eat sushi with chopsticks"". He assumed because I was a Black person, that I didn't know how to eat with chopsticks. Meanwhile, if you're going to be racist to me, at least do it in ENGLISH and complete sentences like most other people!Very shady individual!"

I spit it out and almost puked. I took it back and got my money back, the date on the milk was August 15. The guy gave me my money back but offered no apology. They never give you a receipt so that when I found out that cookie was $2.50, the sticker on the cookie said best by 10/2/2016, I don't think so, it's 8/21/2016 and it's borderline now, wait another month and it will be dust.P.S.

I'm talking about $3 for a water, $2 for a bottle of soda.  Run over to Duane Reade and pick up some beverage option if you are thirsty and want to save a buck.I don't hate this place since it is one of the better options at the end of Wall Street.  They do have way better sandwiches then their neighbor...Subway."

I asked him where are his gloves and he shows me his tongs. I told him that he touched the udon noodles with his bare hands. Again I ask where are his gloves. He makes it seem that it's not a big deal and then saw the look on my face and proceeds to grab gloves. I left immediately! Never again. He could've just come back from the restroom.

You can find baked goods, bento boxes, onigiri, and chirashi bowls.Friday special Chirashi Bowl is the way to go. It is a bowl of tasty, seasoned rice with fresh salmon roe,tuna, and eel. Really good value for what it comes with. Onigiri- rice balls are really good! Spicy Tuna and Salmon are my two favorites. I really liked that the rice is still grainy and fresh by the time I get them. Fish meat to rice ratio is proportional. Incredibly fresh and the seaweed is still crunchy!During lunch hours, the line is out the door but it moves fairly quick.

I am not sure about Monday-Friday but on Saturday, this place has nothing left.I was here twice on Saturdays.. They have very limited option left althought I was there around 11 am...So I just decided to try all their rice balls..Very disappointed by the quality - the rice ball is mostly rice but few ingredient inside the rice ball..Flavor is medicore either.Although the stuff here is very mice, I still have to leave my 3 star here.Maybe it is a take-out heaven on weekday but it is definitely not a good place to be on Weekends."

Because of my work hours, I either end up coming too early (fresh daily bento hasn't arrived yet) or too late (everything is gone ). When there is no bento, I usually try the snacks. The melon pan, mochi donuts and sweet potatoe muffins are great.  Anywho, I finally tried a karaage bento due to a seafood allergy. It was glorious. The only downside is that sometimes not everything is labeled on the bento or snacks ingredient wise. Asking the staff sometimes they don't know what you are asking. If you have food allergies just be careful and try to clarify with staff what's in the food.Suggestion: go around 11:00-11:30 am just before the rush. That's when the food is just being delivered usually."

You may get the privilege of eating the lousy cold sandwich on a second floor dining area. With the option of Bento boxes offered by BentOn Cafe, one can eat for under 10 bucks if you don't mind going back to your office or finding a public space to enjoy outdoors. People watching is always entertaining. For me it's a combination of convenience and good food. I can walk from my office to BentOn Cafe, purchase my food and return to my office in 15 minutes. If i arrive around noon time, there is a line out the door but, the inside of the business is about the size of a closet . The line moves fast, in fact, it moves so well that I couldn't take picture inside. That's good news if you need to select your food and  move on.The food is prepared so, you walk in, grab your selection and pay. Easy and delicious. There is a variety of bento boxes which change daily, cold salads, udon and udon sushi. I have had bento boxes with salmon, chicken, kale, seaweed salad and other delights and have never been disappointed. Their sushi udon is respectable for only $9.00. Miso soup appears to be included in all meals. They offer buns and daily specials.Don't be discouraged by a line out the door. It moves fast as the spot has little indoor space. Other joints that have lines flowing out onto the street in this area but, they have a large dining space and have a lot of people inside. So, BentOn Box is efficient, fast and fresh. Enjoy a hot meal for $8.00 instead of a cold sandwich for almost $12."

The fish is fresh (especially the salmon roe) and the sushi rice is well seasoned. I find the servings to be pretty filling, though I don't like to eat a lot at lunch. The miso soup is usually luke warm, but besides that I've been happy with everything that I've tried. Everyone I've interacted with at the counter has been really kind and helpful. Finally, the prices here are fantastic for the area- you can get a bowl of fresh rice and beautiful fish for less than a Chipotle burrito? Sign me up!"

I've had several of their dishes and they're not all the same.Chicken Katsu Bowl:  This is okay.  It's usually not warm but does the job.  The chicken is kind of flavorless so I wouldn't recommend this really.  Also, it gets soggy after a while.  3/5Ramen:  This is just okay as well.  The broth is good.  The noodles are instant.  And the vegetables and pork are nothing to write home about.  Get it only if you're craving it and don't want to walk another block or two (there are many, many better choices nearby).  3.5/5Chicken (spicy and not) burger:  This is a good amount of food for the price (something like $3? $4?).  However, not all that tasty.  A bit bland but tastes much better with the spicy sauce or some ketchup/mayo.  4/5Salmon Bowl:  This.  I will ALWAYS come on wednesday to get this.  This is delicious and just the right amount of salmon, eggs, and rice/wasabi.  I love getting this whenever I get a chance and will highly recommend.  5/5Seaweed rice wraps (Onigiri):  Your average store bought variety.  Good if you want a quick bite.  4/5"

I've tried the variety chirashi bowl with eel and tuna and the salmon bowl with cooked and raw salmon. Both came with salmon roe and SO GOOD. I haven't actually tried any of their bentos. They also have ramen and udon, which I have yet to try. They do sell little rice triangles stuffed with either tuna or salmon that I have tried, and they make a great snack while a little messy to eat. Prices are fantastic ($9 for the sashimi dons). They also give you a free small cup of miso soup with tofu. No seating so you have to take it away or back to the office, but would 100% recommend for good Japanese on a lunch day! Get there before noon so you miss the line and get the bowls before they run out. If there is a line, does move pretty fast though.(P.s. Apparently some people are freaked out that not all of their food is in the refrigerated glass part of the store, but I've never had any issues when eating here)"

They have just the right proportion of rice, meat, and seaweed for the right price of about $1.50. The Rice Balls are a must try!"

I asked them whether I should  cancel my order as they seemed too overwhelmed and in response the man who claimed his name is Eric Yu said 'Yes cancel and leave' I was shocked by how rude his response was. He also stated that he spoke to all his customers in a similar manner. Saddened & appalled by the service!"

I don't usually consider it to be a highlight of the meal but it was so good I wanted a second bowlSalmon avocado roll - pretty tasty. The fish was good and the avocado actually had flavorTuna avocado roll - somewhat flavorlessSpicy salmon roll - tasted nearly spoiled. I think many places use older or lower quality fish in their spicy rolls because the spicy sauce masks the off flavor, but it didn't work in this caseYellowtail scallion roll - highly suspicious briny/fishy flavor. Yellowtail has a naturally strong-ish flavor which I enjoy, but this tasted like it had seen several unrefrigerated daysI'm a shameless sushi fan and am generally of the mind ""bad sushi is better than no sushi"" (*foodies wince*) but this is the first time I couldn't finish rolls because the taste was so bad.Still, I'd say exactly average rating since the food ranged from great to gross with everything in-between. Overall, I think it's porbably a decent place but there are other sushi places in UES with lower prices that are consistently good across the board so I probably won't order from here again."

We called the restaurant to clarify and they could not have been less helpful. ""Not my problem"" and very defensive posture. We are calling postmates to see who is at fault.

After eating here I can't stop thinking about it it was so delicious I want to eat these burgers every day. I got the double Bronson burger and I'm pretty sure there will be a steady supply of those bad boys in heaven - or at least I hope so.

Perfectly cooked and traveled extremely well (this review is only related to take out*). We enjoyed our burgers so much that we ordered take out again later that week.

The ambiance, service, and food were spectacular. We had seafood towers, corned beef sandwiches, and pigs in a blanket to start. I had the Lobster salad as an appetizer, bone in ribeye entree, and the coconut cake. All delicious! I'm really not kidding when I say there is nothing I would change. This restaurant has been on my NYC bucket list for a while and it definitely exceeded my expectations. Can't wait to go back"
341,EaAAP-gDALDL7GxcseMjBQ,3/3/2023,5 star rating,"This is a beautiful restaurant that happens to also have a solid menu of classic ""all american"" food. Our table of 4 Ordered the cauliflower, the Caesar salad, corned beef sandwiches, and tuna tartar to start. My entree was a burger which was cooked perfectly. The dessert menu is similarly classic and although we didnt order dessert this time, I am sure it would not disappoint. Each dish was strong and id be happy ordering any of them again. I consider it high end comfort food similar to the food at Hillstones, (which I happen to love!) but in a more posh swanky setting. Take a date here to impress them, or dinner with the parents- but on a midweek night it was quite crowded, although Im not sure when this spot is ever quiet!"

To be honest, I didn't think I'd get a reservation. My friend called and gave up waiting on hold so I said I'd give it a try. As I was waiting, I thought there must be another line for VIPs that gets answered. But then I read the Yelp reviews and regular ole people said they got reservations so I was hopeful. I waited about 25 minutes before Austin answered the phone. I got through! So you can get through with some patience. Good luck!!"

We arrived early to have a martini at the bar upstairs. They provide a few snacks that shouldn't be overlooked. When our table was ready, we were escorted down to the dining room. The service was fabulous and the room feels old time, quintessential New York. We started with the free popovers, tuna tar tar, pigs in a blanket and Caesar salad. All were great.For entrees we tried the branzino, veal Milanese and strip steak and a side of mushrooms. No bad dishes.  We finished with espresso martinis and the coconut cake. I love Polo Bar!"

I think about it all the time.....Well, I visited this place after roughly 2 years and they Did Not disappoint. I was greeted with a smile by the friendly bartender. It was on!!!!  For starters they eliminated the old plastic folded menus and upgraded to a glossy tri-fold.  Now I ordered a Mango Margarita, chicken quesadilla with rice and black beans and it came with warm tortilla chips and fresh salsa. And folks it was nothing short of amazing! Thee best part was the flavorful grilled chicken quesadilla. It was sooooooo good!!!! What makes it taste so delicious? It has to be the green peppers and onions along with the sour cream and cheese. However, i love the chips and salsa.....I barely wanted to eat the entree without eating every last one. Yummers!!!!  Now the pico de gallo.....so fresh tossed with shredded iceberg lettuce was thr best I've ever had. Ugh the margarita........not sooooo good. It was too sweet. She poured a little too much syrup. I asked for more ice. It was super sweet and tart."

The flavors, freshness and presentation are always on point. The service is amazing. I've never had a rude or inattentive server or bartender. And the best part?! $5 frozen margaritas all day, everyday. I love Noches Mexicanas and I'm so happy they decided to open here in my hood. The restaurant is spacious, clean and beautiful. Just go here for yourself!"
352,ehdmja52dNhEf_Yyipf0eA,1/17/2020,3 star rating,I really enjoyed their frozen margaritas for happy hour and their red salsa with chips is really good but  I wasn't a fan of their food or their slow service. We came in and had to wait about 10minutes for someone to come greet us because there was no hostess. Once a server sat  us down he seemed pretty busy with a large party so everything took forever to come. I ordered a shrimp burrito and it was lacking flavor so basically come here for drinks and ChipS during happy hour and skip the  meal.

My buddy had the steak bowl which he devoured.Food was not rushed and tasted that way.Really liked that the staff Arturo y Luis were on point about cleanliness and intentionally sat us away from others so everyone was spaced out to make sure there were no issues with germs. Bathrooms were spotless and the place exceptionally clean! Had the ritas which were good, but suspect they may have more 'kick' during the evening HH !:')Will definitely be back!"

357,u9zVZH0liQu9skIz1kGrMA,2/6/2020,5 star rating,"4.5 stars but rounding up. This is my go-to neighborhood hole-in-the-wall breakfast joint when I need something fast and easy. I'm right next to Russ & Daughters and I love their bagels but, man, it's just not worth the several HOUR long wait that I've experienced on weekends before. Heaven's Hot might be the antithesis of R&D. It's no frills, not at all trendy, and never a long wait (I think the longest I've waited was in the 5-10 minute range). Bring your out-of-towner guests to Russ, but this place is great for a local.Everything is pretty significantly cheaper than market standard. My go-to order is a Houston platter with sausage, scrambled eggs, rye toast, and hash browns, and I think the whole thing is under $6. Their coffee is also unreal. I really like their red eyes (a shot of espresso in hot coffee for those not in the know) and especially like them after a night of heavy drinking when I need something to wake up.Employees are super nice and non-pretentious. The last time I was in, they forgot my order, and they were SO incredibly apologetic to the extent where I had to be like, ""No, seriously, it's REALLY no big deal at all."" My one complaint is that the bagels themselves are not great, which is why I usually opt for a platter instead. I also haven't tried any of their sandwiches so I can't attest to those. I would assume they're pretty standard deli fare. Will return."

The space inside is great with bar stools next to the bar and tables a chairs to sit and eat a meal. The waiter doubled as the bartender but he was very attentive to our needs the entire time. Our drinks were great. I went with friends and we each had something different. I went with the sangria, another a Bloody Mary, one with a tap beer, and one with a jalapeño margarita. All were very good!The food menu is a combination of small and large plates. Also sandwiches and some appetizers. I went with the beef burger. Wow!  It came with tomato jam, caramelized onions, lettuce and cheese. It was perfect with a side of fries for $15. It was definitely fresh. My friends were pleased. Two went with chicken sandwiches and the other with a chicken quesadilla. Very good!!Aside from that the only drawback was how cold it was in the restaurant. I must have been under a vent.

I didn't have any food, so can't comment on that. Hopefully next time!"

Go during the day time because it is less crowded and you get your food quicker. Their french fries are so damn delicious. I am so glad this location is blocks away from my house. ::::BATHROOM ALERT:::Clean so you know their kitchen must be nice. The paper was stocked well and they had a lot of soap for your hands. The bartender was our waiter and he was very sweet. I hope that he serves us next time. The feel of the place is very 1920s and I love the fact that they have old pictures of real long island city around.

After picking our seats we waited for about 5 to 10 mins before anyone came to greet us or to bring menus. During this whole time the manager was just hanging out at the bar socializing and talking with the patrons there. A waitress finally came and she was fantastic. Super friendly and great with suggestions. The food was overall good but some misses. The burger was a bit over cooked despite asking for medium temperature. Poached eggs came out soft boiled. Overall the burger was very tasty and the steak and eggs was a good portion and wasn't a skimpy steak. You also get a drink with brunch the usual mimosas and bloody mary. Price is right for drink and food."

Also, their loaded fries are amazing. Makes it kind of worth the wait, but not really.

Both the eggs and steak were cooked just the way I requested. Luv the big portion of fresh tender steak and that they also offered a complimentary glass of Mimosa with the brunch.I posted a picture of it in picture gallery.  I would recommend this place as a must stop in LIC. .

We shared the chicken sandwich and the pulled pork. Both were very tasty. The fries and onion rings are to die for.  Service is very pleasant.
381,cBC55mBdY_1Zj7dfVeWWQg,8/19/2020,5 star rating,Stumbled upon this place on an evening walk and decided to grab a bite. The place has sidewalk seating as well as a charming backyard. The food was great and so was the wait staff. Got the fish and piled pork tacos and shrimp poboy and everything was tasty. Great spot for a quick meal away from the bustle of the street.

The vibe is relaxed, laid back & Brooklyn cool. It's really one of the only places of its kind in the area. We recently had an engagement party there and the staff truly went above & beyond to make it an amazing day for us and our friends and family. We love it there, go support this place!!"
385,cBC55mBdY_1Zj7dfVeWWQg,10/24/2019,4 star rating,"Found this place on yelp when looking for something close to my friends place who I was staying with. I almost passed it on the street, but the vibe inside is hip and cozy. I sat at the bar because I was eating alone. I was greeted and given a happy hour menu. The menu seemed limited but was definitely affordable. I chose the elote, and two tacos, one carnitas and one al pastor. The food came out fast and was so delicious. The elote was a little bland but was cooked great and I still finished it. The tacos tasted fresh and authentic. The al pastor was my favorite definitely. I only had water but there are plenty of beer and wine choices and a full bar. Was definitely pleased with my experience here but coming back to Brooklyn, I'd probably choose to try somewhere new rather than stop here again."

They allow you to make reservations for large parties so we did that and they set aside a great table for us. I love the decor inside and it can be a dark, intimate place for a date or a girls night out. The food was very yummy. I got the brisket burger and fries and it was delicious. It is definitely not a barbecue joint but the brisket was very decent! The drinks looked delicious and they had great choices for cocktails. The waiter was nice and on a weeknight, it does not get very crowded so they do not rush you to finish and go. We were there for nearly three hours without any words from the waiter. I would love to come back and try their drinks!"

The chicken is moist, rice and beans always on point and that green sauce will make you lick your fingers!!

I would add that while I'm not generally a plantain enthusiast, the sweet plantains here were stunning, with a nice char on the outside. The chicken is so flavorful you might not want to hide it in the green sauce, but the sauce is outstanding. I was in the neighborhood but this is worth traveling for."

I order to pick up every time. Location isn't so great to sit and eat and relax since it's in the middle of a high volume foot traffic area due to the F train and a few bus lines. Parking is hard as well, you'd have to double park or look for parking to get out and get your food... IT IS WORTH IT IT IS WORTH IT LET ME TELL YOU -- their chicken melts in your mouth. The ENTIRE chicken. Every. Single. Time. Never fails... their green sauce, their rice, their avocado salad, their beans. Always hot, always soft, always delicious. My favorite so far. Tell me what's a better Peruvian spot?"

393,xo40qrf3EoQfhcx4Q4kX4g,3/17/2019,5 star rating,Still one of my all time favorites.  The rotisserie chicken is the best.  Make sure you get extra ahi hot sauce.  I usually get the sweet plantains but all the sides are good.  The tres leches cake isn't bad!

She said okay but, can I come soon since they were closing soon. I said of course. I get there and it's ready. I pay for it and when I get home it's not what I ordered. She gave me a 1/4 chicken with 2 sides. They knew what they were doing. Since it's about closing time I didn't check it and that was my mistake. Very bad business. It shouldn't matter if it's closing time if an order is taken, it should be made correctly."
395,xo40qrf3EoQfhcx4Q4kX4g,1/21/2015,3 star rating,"The chicken was as good as usual but, unfortunately, the maduros have become very hit or miss. Even when they tell you they're sweet, we have found on multiple occasions that they are not and are too dry to boot. If you order extra green sauce, make sure they pack the proper amount as they sometime shortchange you (perhaps inadvertently)."
396,xo40qrf3EoQfhcx4Q4kX4g,5/28/2016,5 star rating,"So, this is my second visit to this place and it never seems to let me down. I love this Spanish food spot so much and it's so close to home which puts a big smile on my face!The location is easy to find and relatively busy. It's right off of the 179th street F train station and there are ample buses in the area. Parking can be a b* though because Hillside Ave has an annoying amount of bus stops and then there is metered parking and no parking zones. You may get lucky on the side streets, so give that a try.Inside of the location is clean but pretty small. Don't plan on having a large group for this place because it's not made for it, Decor is a bit confusing, they have a bit too much going on but this hasn't affected my scoring on this place one bit. Service and food is amazing which is the most important thing right?My family stopped on in and immediately took a seat. They don't have waiters or waitresses or hosts and hostesses, it's just a ""take any seat"" type of place. The guy and the counter brought us our menu, we looked over what we wanted, and then took our order. It was quick, average cook time, and the food was awesome. Very good serving size for all of us. The flavoring was on point, a little slang there for it was perfect. We all were happy with our food. I don't recall what I had on my first visit here but this time I had the personal 1/4 chicken with rice and beans and maduros. It was 8.49 for my dish, a great price. My husband's and kid's dish was also inexpensive. Our total bill was 36 bucks. Overall great place. I have no complaints except for the parking situation and even though I live nearby, I have to drive there so it sucks that I can't just get parking. Anyway, definitely stop by this spot if you're in the area."

Celery root is a great seasonal ingredient, and the croutons are crunchy but easy to chew. Get the salad with steak which is lean and tender for a complete meal. The brussels sprouts on the other hand was rather flavorless and old. (came in for dinner on Friday at around 6:30)The place is cute and intimate. The weather is still warm enough for outdoor seating. Our waitress was very professional and friendly."
398,9BM1-Obd5Dr8pErgyBbQAQ,4/25/2019,5 star rating,"This is just a small little cafe located on 7th ave in Chelsea. I have walked by it every day on my way to work and always wanted to try it, but never had the time to stop in until a few days ago.  It's actually pretty tiny on the inside, but there are a few outdoor tables as well. This gives it a nice feel. The first thing you realize when you walk in here is that everything is super fresh and healthy. The staff is super friendly too. If you want a cappuccino done right by a barista that knows what they are doing, then this is the place to come. I ended up getting a poppyseed muffin and a fruit & greek yogurt bowl along with my cappuccino and it was actually delicious. The portion sizes were big for what I ordered and everything was super fresh. All of the food had the best flavor to it. I left feeling energized by that meal and supper happy with what I ordered. I will be back again to try other things. It was the best small cafe i've been to in the city."

Couldn't taste the difference between that and their hot chocolate made with skim. It's really light, but not watery.

401,9BM1-Obd5Dr8pErgyBbQAQ,8/24/2018,3 star rating,"REALLY wanted this place to blow me away and I really thought it would. The egg sandwich I got was cold, the tiny portion of cheese wasn't even melted, and the avocado was borderline too browning. Ugh. Sad. I've heard that getting sandwiches from street carts and bodegas can be so much better, but for the $9+ I spent here, I really expected more. It also seems they serve a ton of avocado toast, so it seemed odd that they would serve avocado that was clearly browning.Giving an extra star for the service because the guy behind the counter was super nice and personable. Cute little place, but my return is unfortunately unlikely."
402,9BM1-Obd5Dr8pErgyBbQAQ,7/20/2016,4 star rating,"Rather than being a specialized coffee shop, Commons is more like a brunch place, where it serves a big selection of salad/pastry items, including my all-time favorite avocado toast. Place was kinda tiny, so would definitely recommend drop by during the week. They carry La Colombe coffee beans, essentially the main reason I stopped by with such a large detour. Very cosy feeling, made me wanna come and try their food items...hmm probably mushroom toast this time?"
403,9BM1-Obd5Dr8pErgyBbQAQ,12/25/2014,3 star rating,"This coffee house name ""The Commons"" is one that is used for large New York City cooperative or rental pre-war (World War II or the 1940s) apartment buildings.The muffins appears enticing in three flavors: blueberry, lemon and pumpkin.  I opt for the blueberry $3.50 and one small Chamomile hot tea $2.00.  The muffin was over flowing with too much confectionery flour that it was crumpled to the floor when bitten into.  Yet, the muffin itself was rather dry and not moist.  The Commons Chelsea is a small cafe in Chelsea with very limited seating but appears very inviting and quaint.  Service is somewhat attentive.  Sandwiches are readily available and vouched by Yelpers as ""solid"" which entices me for a return visit.  I always enjoy brioche and the pulled pork sounds inviting.Note:  Watch your step when entering the threshold as there is one big step downward."

So The Commons in Chelsea was my best option (unfortunately Café Gitane is a bit too far to stop by before work).The Commons is pretty small but has a few tables. It was quiet at first but then it started to get really crowded and hot. I was going to get coffee, but then I saw their coffee is from La Colombe (see my reviews for La Colombe and Quench). Is this a new trend? If it is, I don't like it.Avocado toast was okay....a bit too much lemon juice and red pepper flakes.Next time I'll wake up early for Gitane."

Got the pizza funghi e salsiccia, the tagliatelle bolognese, veal agnolotti, spring burrata, and calamari. The pizza and both pastas were great. They were very flavorful, and the meats were very tender. The portions were on the small side, so the 3 of us were full but not stuffed after the 5 items plus dessert. Didn't love the salad - the ingredients didn't quite come together. The calamari was OK - the breading was like fish and chips breading, so a bit different than usual."

My one complaint is that we had a reservation and had been there for less than 90 minutes when they kicked us out for there next guests. While we had paid out bill we were still finishing our drinks. Beware the 90 minutes rule isn't standard here!

Started with the burratta which had a nice summer as of strawberries and then tried the burger, veal agnolotti and of course, pizza topped with the Uva signature truffle sauce. If I could bottle this sauce up and drink it for the rest of my life I would it's that good. I think I prefer it on the gnocchi, but it was great on the pizza as well! The only thing I think this new spot is still working out is the atmosphere. We went on one of the hottest nights of the summer but it was HOT inside. Probably because the tables are pretty close to together and it was packed, but once they work out that kink it will be an amazing experience!!"

The service was very timely, just wish the pasta portions were larger but thats NYC for you on the Upper East Side.

We got the Margherita pizza, calamari, and the Cappellacci Di Zucca. The pizza was great. It held up well  in the middle, no sogginess what so ever which annoys us with thin pizza. The calamari was great as well. Fried perfectly. The pasta was good but it was stuffed so much for us that we would've preferred it slightly less pumpkiny so that we could taste the pasta itself too. Too much pumpkin made it a bit overwhelming and mushy. Overall we'd come here again when craving pasta."

Its a good break from traditional Mexican but I didn't give 5 stars due to the shrimp quesadilla and the delivery.  The ubereats delivery was very slow so and the food arrived cold. The grilled shrimp had an orange tint.  Not sure what the orange color was about because the shrimp was the only thing that lacked flavor. Overall would recommend and order again.

I live right down the street from this place and have called them out on numerous occasions.  The last time, I ordered a turkey sub and the sleezy owner who made the sub looked over at the counter guy and quietly  said ""Italian"".  The guy proceeded to charge me for an Italian sub instead of turkey which costs a few dollars more. I corrected the guy and he then adjusted the price to the correct amount. They know there are a lot of tourists that come in because of the UN area so they take advantage and rip people off. It's a simple matter of principle. STOP ripping off hardworking people especially the naive tourists. This is morally wrong! You're lucky I'm even giving you two stars!"

I began to inspect the slice only to find that were traces of mold on the back. The worst part was parts of the back appeared to be pinched out as if someone was intentionally trying to cover up the pizza going bad. To my understanding, it takes quite sometime for dough to spoil. So shame on you guys for trying to cover it up. You not only lost my business but my whole offices too."

Only option is to pay with cash on delivery.2:55 - Called to check on order. Initially told that they didn't receive my online order. Lady starts taking my order and half way through says they found my order. Then told order was being made and I should expect in 20 minutes. 3:28 - Called again to check on order. Told it was on the way.3:48 - Delivery guy calls and says he is in front but is not. I stay on phone for long while til he actually is in front of house. Pay delivery guy in cash, with a good tip. By motorbike/scooter, I am only like 5 minutes away. Shouldn't have taken over 20 minutes to deliver.3:53 - After getting the food out and divided, realize something is missing. Call them to let them know I am missing an item. Was told they don't have that item anymore and it should've been resolved through beyondmenu and I wouldn't be charged on my credit card. Had an argument with some other guy about the missing item and that I paid in cash and for that item too. Eventually, agreed to have them deliver a replacement item. And was told I would get it in about the 20 minutes.4:20 - Called in to check on my replacement item. Was told it will be very long time because they have lots of orders. I was given no priority even though it was their fault for this issue. Told them to just deliver the refund for the item instead, to do it as soon as possible, and there was no rush.Midnight - Never got my refund and never even got any attempt from them to contact me.Next day - I let it go and just took it as giving a stupidly big tip on terrible service and terrible food. Lesson learned and never again.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO NEVER GET TAKEOUT OR DELIVERY FROM TOYAMA! And dine-in is probably going to be a mistake.- Times and details are of the general basis of what happened with minor discrepancies in exact times, and leaving out of non-important details(ie: I knew the delivery guy was not close because the motorbikes horn was annoyingly obnoxiously loud and could be heard from far away, in addition to making me wait on the phone).- This is a very late post for an event that happened weeks ago due to unusual circumstances."
448,ELCnBV5Ie3VnY2q3842Rbg,7/11/2017,4 star rating,"I've noticed many negative reviews about this place, but personally I've ordered from here a few times at gatherings and parties. (Because of how cheap their rolls are!) Their regular rolls are generally only $1.50-$2 which is pretty much a steal compared to many other sushi restaurants. I have no idea about the freshness, but their raw rolls are always smooth and buttery, so it's a must whenever I order from there.Delivery can be long sometimes (I'm talking beyond an hour), so I would recommend you get pick up if possible. They also don't deliver to certain areas so keep your expectations low when you're craving sushi and calling them.P.S: If you do decide to order from them, definitely try to spicy salmon and mango white tuna rolls ($2 each), they never disappoint!"

Granted, I only have ate their sushi once, but I plan on eating their sushi again in the future. I had eel and avocado sushi, and it was very delicious. From the other reviews, people got sickness from this place, which I thought was crazy because after eating their food, I didn't get sick. Maybe it's because I only ate one food there, but I really liked the sushi. The only reason why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because my avocado was a bit hard, like it was in the fridge or something. Overall, I'm definitely coming back. Their food is good and affordable as well."

Horrible food on top of the super slow service which seems to be intentional by the way. The food finally arrives and it is by far the worst sushi I have ever had. So I tried the fried shrimp...and then the spider roll ...and then the beef skewer.. disgusting.I then asked for beer and the servers says we only have beer sometimes, and today they do not have any. Wth. I had to go the store across the street just to get beer so I can wash the nasty taste out of my mouth.We also ordered a half a dozen of oysters which we had waited over and hour and a half. We finally inquired about it and the server said it was ""being prepared"". We had waited long enough so we decided to cut out losses and canceled the order. 5 seconds later  it magically appears and sent over to the next table which just sat down. This place is a disgrace to be called a sushi restaurant.  Its complete shit of an establishment. Want a good all you can eat sushi restaurant? There are plenty of them on 86th st."
451,ELCnBV5Ie3VnY2q3842Rbg,2/8/2016,4 star rating,"Lunch ends at 4:30 pm so if you are trying to catch the lunch $12.99 deal for all-you-can-eat (AYCE), that is the time you have to arrive before at Toyama. After 4:30 pm comes the dinner price which is $18.99. We made it last Saturday by less than half an hour, yay. There was no one in the restaurant at about 4 pm on a Saturday since we were there pretty late for lunch. For $12.99, I do not expect the best sushi in the world. Keep your expectations low and you'll be happy. You order what you want from a checklist sheet. You just have to indicate the number of portions you want on the sheet. I have been to many checklist AYCE sushi places so this was not a new process for me. When you sit down, the waitress will hand you over a pen and a few sheets. It's pretty self explanatory. If you are unfamiliar with the names of the rolls, I grabbed a takeout menu which further explained each roll. After you finish filling out a sheet for the table, you just hand the sheet over to the waitress. Easy peasy. There is no substitutions so as to make the ordering process faster. I'm sure when it is busy, it must be harder. But since we were the only ones there, the order was perfect. Everything we ordered came to the table. Which is not true at some AYCE sushi checklist restaurants.  There were some hot appetizer items that we ordered from the kitchen like gyoza, tempura, teriyaki, harumaki (fried spring rolls). Also don't expect the best tempura, teriyaki, etc. For $12.99 everything was fine. We had sweet potato, chicken and vegetable (broccoli) tempura, salmon teriyaki, Kani salad (imitation crabmeat salad), etc. I happened to have really liked the small portions so we can try different things. The fried items all tasted the same so I would skip it next time. I really liked the Kani salad. It was fresh with cucumber strips and it was not heavy with dressing. The salmon was good for two people to have one bite each. Which is fine with me, I just wanted a taste. It was only okay. Fried items and teriyaki was skippable. I would order the Kani salad again. It was simple but refreshing. We ordered different rolls but the rolls I remembered are the Spicy Crabmeat (Kani) roll, Dragon roll, and salmon skin roll. I also remember the Godzilla roll because it was disgusting; Cream cheese has no place in a maki roll! I have had other Godzilla rolls and they never had cream cheese. That is just pure disgustingness. The restaurant is located on the quieter part of Brooklyn Chinatown, 7th Avenue. But just one block to 8th Avenue, it is CONGESTED. I can see why they need to attract people to their restaurant by charging $12.99 for AYCE lunch special. They are far enough for people not to see them. There is not as much foot traffic on 7th Ave as 8th Ave. If I didn't see the $12.99 sign for AYCE lunch, I would never have stopped the car. Happy we found this place. For $12.99, I was satisfied. I would totally come back with a group!"

I noticed the price has gone up for their dinner price, it is now $19.99, though they really should change their yellow sign which advertises the old price. The menu has changed up a bit as well, I was surprised the Squid Teriyaki was also included in the buffet, a whole squid. You also get free ice cream for dining in now, got a pretty big scoop of red bean towards the end of dinner with my mom last night. They are still doing the 50% off entire bill for taking out, the insanely cheap take out is whats really making me come back every single time."

Came here on Christmas Day hoping to have a pleasant dinner; instead, we got a garbage experience. I don't understand how this place is still open with the garbage they serve and the service is average at most. You just lost a few customers Toyoma.

Expecting pasta at every Italian restaurant is like expecting sushi at every Japanese restaurant. Don't come here expecting to be wowed by pasta. This isn't what VC specializes in. It's all about the secondi here, so while there are a few pasta options, you really want to save your appetite for the entrees.We got the Porri alla Cenere to start: charred leeks with sheep's curd. They were tasty but not easy to eat with a butterknife--I really wish we'd been given a sharper knife to cut through the stringy leeks. The pasta options were all super basic and uninspired, but we felt the need to try one to assess the quality of the noodles. The Tagiatelle with prosciutto and parmesan was a bit overcooked but obviously homemade. I liked the addition of lemon to make the cream sauce less rich. Still, this was meh, and I wouldn't bother with any of the pastas next time.The standout of the meal was the Coniglio Fritto, fried rabbit, rosemary and garlic. It's so rare to find rabbit in an Italian restaurant, so when you do find one, please don't shy away from ordering it. In this case, the rabbit was perfectly crisp yet juicy and tender on the inside. The fried rosemary needles were the perfect accompaniment, and the fried bread piece that accompanied the rabbit was just carb icing.Service was pretty quick and friendly during our first hour, then noticeably less attentive when things picked up. Still, we were able to pay and leave without waiting too long, which is bette r than many other hot spots I've been to."

A group of 6 of us arrived when they first opened and were immediately seated. Everything tasted good! I wasn't the biggest liver fan, but the liver mousse on toast was good to try. To this day, I don't know if it was the friend group or what, but that meal always stuck out to me as one of my favorite meals in NYC.Fast forward to the post-pandemic world where I've learned forget about trying to score a reservation on Resy. Instead, just get to the restaurant any time between when they open and 30 minutes after they open and you can usually get a seat. Via Carota is best with a group of 3+ and 6 is perfect because there's not much space in the restaurant for large groups, but 6 allows you to try a little bit of everything.The green salad always is a nice opener. Pastas are great and the fried rabbit is not bad. At the same time, all of the food is delicious. Would I wait 30 minutes for this place? Nope.

Dinner was efficient and completely delicious, start to finish. I had just heard an interview of the chefs on KCRW's Good Food and they spoke about the vegetables, so that was my main focus, though we were just two people, so we only ordered one: butter beans and spinach which is incredibly simple and oh so good. The other items were the 'njuda arancini, tender meatballs, the daily special pasta with truffles (my god), and zabaglione with fresh berries for dessert. My wine was perfect.

We got seated in the party room, it's large enough to fit 12 people and we were seated at one end of the large table while there's another family sitting at the other end of the table. For food, we ordered funghi, cacio e pepe and the boar tagliatelle. The mushroom was lacking a bit of flavor but great when mixed with the tagliatelle pasta sauce. Cacio e pepe was amazing!

As far as cacio pepe goes this is quite decent. The consistency of the noodles is really nice. They are not too soft or too hard. The sauce is good, a decent balance between the cheese and pepper, but overall it did just have way too much pepper that it overpowered the dish. I would come here again but wouldn't get this pasta."

They have this really cute outdoor area where you can BYOB and have delicious freshly made food. Back to the sandwich, their dough is made fresh and obviously by Licastri. During rough pandemic period, dough did not fail my team and I. Being a front line worker, not only do we have to ensure everyone's lights are on but just the regular essentials of places being open for food.

I liked that the Buffalo sauce was actually spicy and it accompanied the blue cheese well. However, the chicken was very dry (the Buffalo slice at la piazza pizzeria is way better). I recommend sticking to the classics here like margarita, lazy Sunday. My brother says hotter than July is good too!

The bouncer glared at me in a confrontational way for an extended period of time, until I finally asked him if I needed to show my I.D. He mumbled a greeting under his breath (in a condescending way), which was barely audible.I have never been greeted in such a hostile manner in any of the other 10 or so times i have been to these 5 different Barcade locations in the past. I do not deserve this type of treatment, I am a good customer. It is a shame because I have no other negative feelings about the rest of the arcade games or pinball machines or business inside the establishment. I do not deserve to be glared at in a confrontational way, and overall treated with such hostility when I show up at the door of this location. I will take my business elsewhere.By the way, this is the third time i have been to this location in Williamsburg, and the previous 2 times, I have never had an issue."

My favorite, ""must play"" games in here are 4 player Pac-Man, Crazy Taxi, and a very unique light gun game they keep tucked away near the bathroom. With a mixture of classic arcade games, sports games, and a selection of pinball, there's a little something for everyone. I found myself bouncing from machine to machine like a kid in a candy store all night. My friends and I had a lot of fun and really enjoyed that they were a number of multiplayer games available. They also sell really cool shirts and hoodies as merch!When I went, the staff were friendly and nice. The bouncer was funny and upbeat. The barkeep was very helpful and I really liked that I could put tokens on my tab! I've been to barcades where this was not an option, so I thought this was a great move.This is definitely the place to go in the city with friends. It's not so big that you feel lost or it feels impersonal, but it's not so small that you feel like you run out of things to do. Highly recommended!My only suggestions to the owner would be to change out some of the less popular games to add more multiplayer games, and maybe add a few snacks? Neither of those two were impactful enough to reduce this below a five star, just my two cents."

Even if you don't enjoy video games- there's a bunch of cool themed pinball machines, shooting games (try that very very simplistic one), and driving games. So if that doesn't sound interesting whatsoever- try a couple beers off their menu. The bartenders are very friendly and accommodating where if you so much as question a certain beer they almost automatically give u a quick sample. Heaven for a nit-picky chatty sampler like myself. About the selection- I adore the fruit-punch monkey something (cool names) in the middle of the front page that's similar to the Hawaiian sounding tart one. Tasted what it'd be like if blue moon, grapefruit and lemon juice had a baby. Also the ""meat and potatoes"" was the smoothest Guinness I've had. There is a beer or game for anyone here if you are open to exploring within those parameters."

Favorites: Mortal Kombat II, Alien vs. PredatorFood: they've got a binder where you can order food from neighboring spots and eat it here.  I love places with a DIY setup like this.Great place to stop in if you find yourself in Brooklyn!"

After showing proof that it was indeed Pure Peppermint Oil the manager on duty he responded ""yeah, that's cocaine.

I asked him to add corn as well, I was completely ignored. He didn't add the corn. At this point, I already knew what kind of environment this place was. He asked me what sauce I want. Told him the sauce I want. Seen him pour the sauce into a cup. Covered it with a lid. But didn't put the sauce in my bag. What kind of fuck shit is this!? I ordered chips and salsa on the side. The chips was in some container on the floor. If I knew it was on the floor I wouldn't have ordered it. HOW can u put the chips on the floor where your feet is and top of that where all the dirt and dust is. That's disgusting! Ew! I didn't bother to eat it. Wasted $4.

I was craving some healthy ( ...as healthy as FF Chinese can get) food options and didn't bother to check out the Yelp reviews prior. I guess the couple times I've been I've always been treated great but then again I have yet to do a call in order so maybe my experience will change.Anywho, it's on 129th, crazy parking fiasco at times but that the deal you get with going to this strip. I've ordered a handful of dishes but my fave which I ordered on a whim was the tofu and eggplants. Delicious! I even got my meat-eater friend hooked on the pork and eggplant dish. The portions are pretty good, not an overload but enough to keep you satisfied. I usually order their brown rice,for health sake, I swear ;) and maybe because I actually like the taste of the crunchy grainy-ness. Anywho, I have yet to really venture out in the Chinese FF fare around but overall this joint is near the crib so it's convienant, nothing fancy but not horrible by any means."

Walnut shrimp-  fried shrimp was soggy , had the exact same brown gravy the beef had minus the orange peels,( walnut shrimp is suppose to be in a white sweet sauce)Called  the restaurant, they apologized, their resolution.....""we will give you a partial credit next time you order"".......Lol yeah right"

First off, the phone person was rude over the phone and in person (I ordered pick-up). I was trying to give him the benefit of the doubt; maybe he was overwhelmed with other deliveries. I get there and the place is empty and the staff (kitchen and FOH) are all just sitting and staring at each other. I smile and tell him I'm picking up an order and he grabs the bag from behind him and points at the receipt where the price is and doesn't even look up or verbalize it to me! Maybe I should've just walked out without the food.The food was bland and was obviously not prepared fresh. We ordered a 'chinatown style wonton noodle soup' and got pre-packaged dumplings from the market with salty broth and thick hard lo-mein type noodles (not flat egg noodles). I took one bite and threw out the rest of the soup. The rice in the chicken with broccoli was hard and some were translucent (obviously old leftover rice), chicken was really chewy, and the broccoli was the only thing decent.The prices do not commensurate with the quality of food they put out. Though, they get away with it since they are the only asian restaurant in the area (staying out of the boonies).The service, food quality, and price all SUCK!"

The staff showed us into the beautiful drawing room and served us tea. They also checked us in early and upgraded us to a suite! When we arrived in our suite there was champagne and flowers and a hand written birthday note from the management! The room was so warm and inviting and the marble bathroom had a beautiful tub and TV. We were beyond impressed. We had high tea luncheon in the dining room and it was an amazing experience, felt like we were in London!

Fourth and most importantly... The food is SO good they overload you with portions my turkey bacon egg white on a bagel was very nicely filled over lapped with so much turkey bacon I loved it! Sorry no photos next time the food was THAT good I dived in there!Well if you know MY reviews I'm honest I don't sugar coat shit! The resturant is fully loaded with fresh baked goods and all types of beverages!Honestly it could use a more cleaner approach in the seating area a couple of annoying flies but I have to say you serve me like royalty and feed me like royalty I'm happy!Give this place a try!

I walked in towards where the guys were cooking to order my sandwich and no one took my order, so I went to the register and stood there for a good 5 min, not so bad since it's 8:36 am. Two people came in. Ordered with the cook and left before me, again maybe because I'm new, I wasn't really mad about that. I was more pissed that I purposely drove to get to work 25 min EARLY so I wouldn't have to rush to eat my food before work, do u want to know what time I left that place???? 9. I was standing there for a good 20 min and I know this because I was chatting with my room mate the entire time. Then on top of that they gave me the wrong bag and tried to charge me $14 for a turkey bacon egg and cheese sandwich with an Arizona green tea and a Starbucks frappucino. I was like yeah no I got a sandwich I'm not paying $14 for that lady at the register sorry lol My first experience with this place was about a week ago. I ordered food around 11:15am and it decided to show up at 12....this place is legit 6 min walking from my job and it took an hour. Then on top of that the delivery guy didn't really speak English well, so when he called my cell to let me know he was here I could hardly hear or understand him, then some lady tried to translate and just yelled into the phone ""your food is at the front"" so I ran to the entrance, I call the guy back and he's still not there...he's standing at the exit inside the building. I was like oh maybe it was just busy, then today I go in, get ignored stand for 20 min (mind you I stand all day at work) was late to work & on top of all that I didn't even want to eat the damn food because it was sloppy as hell!! I was better off just going to McDonald's to be honest. I work in customer device and deal with people all day, so I understand but I never rush my clients, it's rude and will just cause problems later so I don't like being treated like that. The man I gave my order to also forgot the order 3 times, again doesn't bother me if you forget I know it's busy, I but I do get pissed when you forget my order and send 2-3 people out the door who came in after me. Those orders he remembered but not mine so I was a little disappointed. He was nice not rude at all. He said sorry however didn't offer anything as he could clearly see I was getting annoyed after 20 min. He could have taken an OJ or my Arizona off the bill or something lol not that I would take it, it's the gesture that matters the most. Don't think I will be making another visit. If you can't handle to work load then don't take the orders or get an extra person on staff for the morning.

It was quite yummy and I was sad as I finished my last bites that it was gone... For dessert, I had a serving of flan, also delicious. I will certainly go back again to try their other foods. If you are in the area, it makes a great place to grab some chow... If they fix up the decor, I could see this moving from 4 to 5 stars..."

It's the same thing you'll see everywhere. But Spiro's differs in 2 respects: 1. Burritos. Not something you often see at cafes of this nature, though given its Sunset Park locale it makes sense. Anyway, they are HUGE (2 meal huge). And amazing. One thing I don't like is that they put lettuce in the burritos - a personal pet peeve of mine. It skeeves me out, so I always request they omit it. They do so gladly. Which leads me to the way more important 2. The service. I seriously love every single person who works here. They're friendly, helpful, and just really, really nice. I sometimes stop in here for coffee and a muffin or bagel on my way to work. I wouldn't say the muffins and bagels are exceptional, though the coffee is very good. I could get these items any where, but I keep coming back to Spiro's because I want to give this place business. Not that I really need to, it's always busy. That reminds me. I recommend calling ahead to place your order, because if they're slammed you might have to wait a bit. They also deliver, and have no minimum order to do so."

I got down at 36th st and Spiro's was the closest restaurant in my sight. That's how I ended here. * First of all, the bathroom heater needs a fix. It was freezing inside with my pants down and an open window.* After cleansing my bowels, it was time to eat something. So I got myself a cup of coffee and an omelet. It was cheap and tasty. Infact everything on the menu was cheap - the pancakes, omelets, sandwiches, lumberjack breakfast special like Johnny's luncheonette in Flatiron.* Oh yes and as other reviews mention - the waitress was cute and beautiful."

Let me explain: This women takes our order with a stank face. Fine, whatever. And then she proceeds to smack one of us with the menu. Fine, maybe it was an accident.We ordered 2 orders of the BBQ meats and a small seafood pancake. There were 5 of us,, so maybe the order was small but it's still worth $120. This waitress has the fucking AUDACITY to roll her eyes and go ""huh""? She got angry at US, the customers who are gonna pay regardless, for ordering less than I guess what 5 people usually order. Every time we talked to her, she rolls her eyes. Like, woman... the cost of this meal isn't going to change your wage. Why you so mad?The seafood pancake comes and this woman literally holds the plate under my nose and continues pushing it into my face like I'm gonna eat it off of her hands. DO YOU NOT KNOW ITS COVID SEASON?! ARE YOU NOT AWARE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS?Idk if she realized but to talk behind our backs means to go somewhere and talk literally away from our eyes. I guess she's not the subtle type as she talks shit about us in front of us with her coworkers.Bruh. Jesus Christ. Overall, the bad experience left a bad taste in our mouths.

We ordered the galbi combo and I think when they say 2-3 people, it really means 2-3 families. So much meat and all delicious! We not only left stuffed, but had enough leftovers for another full meal for each of us (we were a party of two). We sat outside in the parking lot in a tent that was split up into private outdoor dining rooms--perfect for large families or anyone who is trying to be extra safe with social distancing. COVID measures were thoroughly followed, with each staff member wearing a mask (properly!) and hand sanitizer being provided. They were installing heat lamps while we were there so it's great to know this spot is an option for when the weather gets colder but the craving for Korean BBQ is still there. Because we sat outside the kitchen cooked our meat for us but the tables inside do have the tabletop grills so that is an option if you eat indoors. Wheelchair accessibility: the restaurant is accessible from the street with a beautifully designed accessible restroom (if you use a scooter, you may have to angle it just so to close the door, but staff are very helpful). To get to the outdoor seating, it's easier to round the corner and go directly to the parking lot than to go through the restaurant interior as the path to the back door is narrow."

Very spacious and roomy for everyone. The meat was good quality and came with many many pickled veggies, kimchi and sides. We also got army soup and dukbokki. All very well spiced but flavorful. I especially liked how the rice cakes were the perfect amount of chewy and not tough at all."
525,f5LgJ9TOZis-cQHAND97nA,7/4/2021,5 star rating,Great food. Plenty of parking spaces at the back of the restaurant. Clean bathroom. Plenty of flavorful ban chan (side dishes). We get the marinated beef and marinated pork. The marinated beef is so good. It is melted on your mouth. The marinated pork is ok. The hameul pajeon (seafood pancake) is a must. They are so crispy and delicious . The key thing is the bbq at this restaurant is using charcoal instead of electric grill. It makes the meat more flavorful. Highly recommended even tough the meat is a bit pricier than regular bbq restaurant

Setting was okay, service was great! Food? Delicious. This year, we wanted to do something a bit different than our usual new year family dinners. Korean BBQ is definitely an outlier in that aspect for us and one that we don't experience together often. Bi Won was recommended to me by a friend so when we were all brainstorming where to go, I suggested it. I think everyone agreed afterward that it was a smart choice. Everything was amazing and we were so full we probably thought at the time we don't need to eat again, ever. We ordered several different meat combos that included beef galbi and pork. It's not Korean BBQ if you don't get these... Let's be honest right? The icing on the cake was that the establishment were also happy we came with such a large showing that they gave us a seafood platter and rice cakes, on the house! As if we didn't have enough food... Would recommend this place for large dinners and delicious Korean BBQ meats. Happy Lunar New Year!"

528,f5LgJ9TOZis-cQHAND97nA,1/7/2020,5 star rating,"It would take 20-30 minutes to fully pour over this menu of traditional Korean and BBQ. However, we were here for weekday lunch, so we focused on the lunch special menu. Still, there were about 2 dozen lunch special items and combos, that it was hard to choose what to eat.We (three adults and five children ranging from age 9 to 4) three lunch combos (soft tofu stew & pork belly, soft tofu stuew & kalbi, and spicy naengmyun & kalbi), budae jjigae (army stew), dolpan bibimbap (stone pan mixed rice), and udon. Way more food than we could eat with a price tag of $108 (including tax).There are many Korean options in this area, so each restaurant has their own special service item. At Bi Won, they mix a spicy squid and vegetable banchan (side dish) at your table. Delicious, fresh, and devoured.All of the dishes were very good to excellent. We really didn't scratch the surface of what the restaurant has to offer. You can't go wrong as everyone in a large party with find something to their liking."
529,f5LgJ9TOZis-cQHAND97nA,1/4/2021,5 star rating,"My friend made a reservation for a party of 8 on a Saturday evening. We were in our own heated tent and it was spacious as well. It felt like we had a private event going inside! We ordered B1, B4 (galbis) and B12 (bulgogi). The galbi were both flavorful and although it wasn't cooked in front of us, it was brought on a hot plate. I had their bibim naengmyun to eat with the galbi and it was yummy. The noodles were chewy and it was a good amount for me to share with my husband. Their seafood pancake was very crunchy AND chewy and well fried. I have to admit, it was one of the best seafood pancakes I've ever had. The service was also really great. They have a pressing bell outside with the table for when you need something and want the server's attention. They came out right away and were very attentive. Parking was also easy and convenient. Overall, a solid place for kbbq and any home cooking Korean food."

532,TeTpGQcPG-j_YFGrZR2eag,6/22/2010,2 star rating,"Used to go to this place purely because it was close to my office and the lines were considerably shorter than Dishes, down the block.  Even though the food was not as fresh or tasty in the hot/cold bars, and the sandwiches were only so-so, I'd often find myself sacrificing quality for a quick meal (by the time it's lunch, I'm starving at work and just want to get in and get out with food in hand!).  Though, they recently hiked up their prices and for what they're charging now, no way they even compare to the equivalently priced, yet significantly better quality and tasting, Dishes."
533,TeTpGQcPG-j_YFGrZR2eag,5/6/2014,4 star rating,This was my go-to lunch spot for years. The salad bar was actually one of the healthiest and cheapest options I could find in the nabe.

Korean-style buffet lunch is great and they rotate several of the meat dishes throughout the week so you don't get sick of items. They don't skimp on the quality either - I've seen seafood and roasted duck on occasion.

No one coming out to tell everyone what's up. Cuz they think they're all that & think we need them. Well I don't.There's always a line because they serve one customer at a time which is ridiculous but of course they want this cuz it gives people the Illusion they're in that much demand.Their vegetarian burrito tastes like a blander Chipotle (I went here two days before.)If you want to be seen at a cool looking place & take photos of it this is the place for you. If you want to wait on an artificially created line cuz they're too cheap to serve two customers at a time & be served when they feel like it this is also the place for you."

545,8_NilECM6qg_L7WYb25uNw,1/23/2022,4 star rating,"Luchadores is a small no-frills stall on the outskirts of South Seaport - basically the kind of store you come across as you're heading home from a nice walk. The line was pretty long and moved quite slow, there were 2 parties in front of us and it took around 15 minutes. There were only 2 guys working back there in a small space, so I understood. Everyone in line was patient and seemed like a good time to talk on date night. The burrito was massive and the fish taco was good, but the ingredients didn't taste as fresh as Tacombi down the street or others in the area. You get what you pay for. They also ran out of lettuce when we got there so he put cabbage instead (which I actually prefer) but running out of lettuce at peak dinner time is a big no-no. I think that was part of the slow down too because one of them had to keep running back to the fridge to check for ingredients and refill stuff. I appreciate the large portion sizes, but did note that neither of the servers were wearing masks while making the food. At least they changed their gloves in between, but while ringing us up he touched the cash register with his gloved hand, then used the same hand to sprinkle cheese on our burrito, only to swipe our card with the same gloved hand O_O"

It's dinner time on a summer weekend and you don't have guacamole...or tomatoes...or any sauces. Why continue to serve then? Or why not run to the grocery store to buy ingredients? For $4.95 for a single taco, I hoped for more than limp shredded iceberg lettuce atop some dry fish. The location is nice, but you're better off with a street water dog."

We stopped by this bar last Saturday and were the only two patrons, so we took a seat at the bar where we met a friendly and talkative bartender named Ben (the servers name according to the receipt). As we left, we gave him an almost 50% cash tip.I guess however, that it wasn't enough for him since he added an additional tip to the credit card slip after we left. Shame.

If you're around stop by and try anything I'm sure you will NOT regret it. Bandeja Paisa with a jugo de tomate de arbol en agua is always what I go for.

I give them 5 stars because the food is just so good and you get a lot for the price. The tostones are my favorite side dish, and the arepa con queso and scrambled eggs are the perfect breakfast combination. For dinner I always get a chicken dish, with the mushroom sauce or shrimp sauce and a big side of white rice. The meal is so large you'll either take some to go or leave stuffed. They have so much to choose from, practically every type of meat you could want.Milo frio is a really good side drink (I take mine cold) that is chocolaty and the consistency of a milkshake almost. They have a lot of fruit juices to choose from that are blended and made with milk or water. They have typical Colombian coffee that's pretty good for breakfast too.The atmosphere is unique; neon lights everywhere and it almost reminds me of a play set or something. My favorite part of Cositas is how it makes me feel like I'm in Colombia getting served a traditional delicious Colombian meal. I go here at least once a week!"

Me, i just came in for the food and quickly realized this would be my first and last time here.   I could blame the waitresses for their bad attitude and super slow service, however keep in mind that is why there is a manager or an owner, both absentees. These girls tend to the single men that come to cheer them up, unless you are one of their cheerleaders you will not get service. You can see the waitresses chatting by the bar and totally ignoring their customers. They walk like as if they are in a modeling runaway, it is hilarious to watch.  In any event, go there at your own risk LOL"

However, I don't believe I should just be giving the people at Friends and Lovers my money for nothing, because I don't think it's a good cause. This place offers the same product as some other spots in the neighborhood, but charges money or more money. The live acts here are nothing special. I've seen better shows at The Way Station or Branded. And they don't even charge most of the time there. Here there's a cover and I'm not sure why. It's Brooklyn. Pay the band some money out of your money. They make plenty too. They charge way too much for beer. And they use poor ingredients for their cocktails and mixed drinks.Overall I don't care for the place and have been disappointed on numerous of occasions."

The owner gave great suggestions. we also got the stuffed pizza which I would definitely get again. The pesto gnocchi also delicious and the wild boar special.

We chose inside because it was still quite warm and humid out. However, you're still getting some of the heat coming in since the doors are left open. It's quite nice. The bar is also open. I think the pizza oven in the back in plain sight adds a nice touch to the overall presentation. Our party of 2 started off with the Grilled Squid and Arugula salad. Absolutely loved the squid. It was grilled to perfection. Squeeze some lemon on top and you're good to go. Great starter item. I had the Linguine with Clams as my main. It was delicious. So much flavor. My only complaint is that the pasta could have been cooked a bit longer. It was still a little hard. Overall, I thought the food was really good here.Service was fast. Super casual service, but professional at the same time. I'd go back and try their pizza next time."

584,Z67mgMkN3RfdPEX5mXsyYA,7/24/2018,3 star rating,"We stumbled into this place because of torrential downpour but turned out to be a decent spot! Giving it three stars today because I didn't get the opportunity to fully explore their menu...and because I was incredibly hungry that evening looking for a nice wholesome hearty pizza and it wasn't as satisfying as I had hoped for considering the price tag. (PS they only accept Amex and Cash -- the ATM machine is in the bathroom!)As goes w/ NYC pizza, there's a spectrum of pizza joints in nyc and this one was more on the gourmet and extra thin side. My pizza mood/expectation was different so just be aware this the pizza is very light, crispy and soft. I enjoyed the sauce but the crust could've been cruncher. At the suggestion of our waiter we tried the ""Timballo di Zucchine con Mozzarella Pomodoro and Basilico"" -- most simply it was a ball of fresh mozz wrapped in zucchini slice..we weren't a fan but maybe others are!"
585,Z67mgMkN3RfdPEX5mXsyYA,10/22/2021,1 star rating,"Horrific service! We were told that we could sit to enjoy a couple of drinks while we waited for a friend. At no point were we told to sit at the bar. There was no issue. That is until the main waiter came by and you could tell he wanted nothing to do with us from the start. When we told him we weren't ordering food (which, again, wasn't an issue with the other waiter), he was a nightmare. He then says ""you're not ordering food? Oh, okay, well we have a reservation coming in for this table so you guys will have to move later."" We had no problem with that because the only reason we sat at a table is because WE WERE TOLD TO SIT THERE. But this didn't make sense because if we ordered food, where would the reservation people be sent? They'd have to wait for us to finish? This was clearly a ruse to make us go away, and I wish I had.   About 5 minutes into our drinks, the waiter returns, says nothing, and just snatches the QR code menu off of our table WITHOUT saying ""excuse me. I need to grab this for another table."" Nope. Just interrupted our conversation to snatch this thing with no words. Then, the man who was making the food in back would come out to the door or after returning from another table, and just stare at our table clearly upset and bothered that we didn't order their food because we were told it was okay for us to just order drinks. Again, at this point, we feel the passive aggressiveness and just want to finish and go. Another 5 minutes go by and he returns, slaps the check on our table and walks away. 1. We're not done with our drinks and 2. We never even asked for the check -- he didn't even ask if we were all set or needed anything else. He didn't ask if we wanted the check. He just wanted us out.  We were not rude or loud or obnoxious. We just simply sat where we were told to sit. I've never been treated so terribly at a restaurant and always treat everyone with respect, especially service people because I work in service myself. I personally handed a 50%+ tip to the kind waiter who originally sat us down to make sure the miserable soul didn't snatch it for himself, but when it comes to the taller, pudgy waiter whose existence seems to be that of misery, AVOID HIM at all costs. Your experience will be horrible."

I was in New York with my sister and this place was walking distance from our friend's place where we were staying. We had one of those nights that only New York visitors can have and appreciate (because New Yorkers are spoiled and have this allllll the time so they take it for granted) -- a late night dinner where you go big right off the bat and order 3 appetizers, incredibly delicious pizza, pasta, wine barrels for days, dessert... and by the end of the night you're delirious with food and wine and you think I will never forget this place. Ever. No need to review it now or make a note of the name. But because you're in New York it's stimulation overload and you have another 15 experiences just as amazing as this one and now you're back in California, years have passed, and you can't remember the name of the place. I kinda forgot about Piacere until I stumbled upon it again the summer of 2018. OMG. It's the pizza place with the long red booth seating and the bar with all the stools, and it's cash only, and the pizza is glorious....!!! I think about Piacere all the time. Such good memories of the food & ambiance that it's actually on my post-COVID bucketlist."

The restaurant feels inimate and cozy with the wood burning pizza oven in the back. The servers are very friendly. The arugula pear salad was a perfect appetizer! It had light dressing and tasted fresh. Loved the complimentary fresh focaccia and white bread with olive oil. All of their specials sounded amazing, but I went with the cannelloni. The cannelloni was absolutely amazing! The rigatoni with bacon and red sauce was also very very good! For dessert, the tiramisu was heavenly! It was full of flavor and was creamy. This place is outstanding! I look forward to my next visit! Side note: **ITS CASH AND AMEX ONLY!**"

For food: - pappardelle with wild boar: best dish of the night. The pasta was done well and the boar wasn't too gamey. - seafood pasta: the clams wasn't fresh and taste a bit rotten. Don't order this  - sausage and mushroom pizza: tomato sauce was lacking but the crust was nice. It makes a nice snack or appetizer, but definitely not as a main course.  Tldr; mediocre food and drink. It's a nice place for a large group -- long tables, loud and decent service."

This time here and it was much livelier and food was also better. I got the preserved cabbage soup base and extra seafood for $2.00 more. The sides were free and it came with pork strip, corn, pickled cabbage, Chinese sausage, tofu strip, and mushed pork? It came with a lot and was super affordable. The soup was definitely flavorful but I was super dehydrated after the noodle soup. I was full with just one serving of noodles but for those who can eat more, there's definitely enough soup and toppings to basically give you a second noodle soup bowl. It was sort of difficult to flag down a waiter to refill my glass of water and to pack the leftovers. To pack the leftovers, it's 75 cents per container. There was only one bathroom. I really hate when there's only one restroom. Overall, a better experience and I wouldn't be opposed with coming back again."

593,wdGMVLUzocmnl2tST0lheg,9/17/2022,4 star rating,"You'd be hard pressed to find a better deal than this-- a big bowl of noodle soup for ~$12 with a bunch of toppings and unlimited noodles if you dine in. My friend and I were seated immediately, but I do see how it could become busy quite quickly. I ordered the coconut curry soup which was flavorful and just the right amount of spicy for a spice weakling like myself (I'm working on it). When you get your soup, it's literally just the broth with all of the toppings served next to it in these little bowls. Part of the experience seems to be dumping it all inside and being very proud of yourself. I will say that I found it fun in a little kid in a candy store type way, but I was underwhelmed by the amount of toppings there were. Like... exactly one shrimp? One tofu? One little slice of ham? It was a bit lacking.I loved that they gave us unlimited bowls of noodles though. And the noodles were great-- soft and slightly chewy like rice noodles should be. Will definitely be back if I'm in the area!"

It's a small busy restaurant but they actually have a lot of seatings and they have more in the back too. The way to order is that you basically order your soup base and each comes with 12 small side dishes that you can eat on the side or Put in your noodle soup. The soup broth comes in the hot clay pot so any raw meat you put in would be cooked instantly. You can pay extra to order more side dishes or not, the noodle soup is big portion and we can barely finished. I ordered a picked cabbage noodle bowl and my friend ordered their spicy bowl. We both enjoyed it. The soup base was a little salty for me but it flavor was good, though I'd love it more if the pickled cabbage flavor can be stronger. Overall, not bad."

We were serve pretty quickly as the sides and noodles were the same. Only thing we had to wait for was the soup. They also forgot they already gave us noodles when they serve us with the soup so we didn't have to ask for extra noodles at the end (that are normally free refills anyway). The spicy picked pepper soup was ok and for my friends, tomato soup didn't really taste like tomato. We ordered the squid tentacles and it tasted like a salt and pepper squid without breading. I like the taste of it but I as a little too chewy for me. Overall, I would come back again but would love to try the spicy soup base."

The takoyaki had a potato croquette texture vs the actual Japanese version. The beef, tripe and ox tongue in chili sauce was ok but the tripe was super bland making me wonder if they just put everything together last minute..Soup base was fine. I would find it comforting on a cold chilly day. The popcorn chicken was good as well and the unlimited noodles is a great addition. I wouldn't mind coming back but it's definitely not at the top of my list lol"

Great prices. Free noodle refills during dine-in and $1 soup refills. Skewers are okay and apps can be skipped. The noodle sets are the best. Staff improved a lot over the years. Get one of these choices- tilapia (fish, not other toppings, white pepper flavor, delicious), pork and sour vege (toppings included, mild, as expected), and coconut curry (delicious curry)."

We ordered a lychee slush with jellies and oolong milk tea with bobas. My sister was promptly served her drink while mine took a minute of wait-time. The drinks were atypical of bubble tea places and we thoroughly enjoyed them. You are able to customize the tea of flavors and additional toppings you'd like to add (50¢ ea), as well as the sugar intake level (%)."

I am not a big fan of ""bubble"", so I always ordered the oolong float (oolong tea base topped with cheese foam), the tea was refreshing and the cheese foam added a creamy texture that enriched the flavor. If you are not a milk tea person, they also offer a lot of fruity tea. Besides the tea, they had Taiwanese street food and bento box on the food menu as well. I only tried the Taiwanese bbq sausage, it was $5 for two pieces, pretty tasty, they always made it fresh (but a bit greasy). I have not tried the bento box yet, not sure if it is good.The waitresses were pretty nice, after you ordered, they would give you a ticket for pickup. You can take away or eat there, they have four tables.This is definitely not as fancy as other bubble tea place in Asia but yea, it is in UES, so let's don't be harsh and adjust the expectation."

I had though the Upper East Side had no bubble tea chains (as my last work location had none sadly) but lo and behold a Vivi's right by the train station!They really chose a prime spot to open. Props to them!It's a small space inside with four tables and seating on both sides. There's also a standing area across from the tables for when it gets crowded I supposed.The order is taken quickly and they have a stamp card! Someone may or may not have already 4 stamps on their card within the span of a week. With the hot summer weather coming soon, I will probably be redeeming my stamp card within the next three weeks.I've only tried the milk tea and strawberry yakult from here. The milk tea is your typical chain store milk tea. It's definitely from a powder. It's a bit more on the sweet side. The strawberry yakult has actually strawberry...pieces inside it! It was a bit off putting at first as I didn't expect it but it's pretty tasty! I will definitely be back to try their other flavors and the popcorn chicken!"

This was our first stop. Before we got there we decided to rate our experience on several criteria: 1) Presentation (everyday or chic?); 2) Cost-Value (is the price equivalent to the experience/taste); 3) Donut type (cake: moist or no? yeast: doughy or gummy?); 4) Dunkability--can it survive C's test of dunking into whatever hot drink he had?  5) would it become our new favorite place? We liked Nostrand Donut shop. It had an everyday type feel like a place you just go to have a donut and chill for a minute without worrying about anything. We picked up a Toasted Coconut and a Chocolate Glaze.  The toasted coconut was cake and not too dry and very tasty. It passed the dunkability test. The chocolate glaze donut was a little dry but we forgave them; we were starting our adventure late. Overall, it got a great review and we liked its charm, but sadly would not be our new favorite donut place. I would definitely visit again."

Their Salvadorean cuisine is mouthwatering good. I always get the same thing when I come partly because because I am a creature of habit and partly because if something is this good, why change it? I'd recommend ordering two pupusas: una revuelta (1 mixed) y una con queso (and 1 with cheese). Pupusas are lightly pan fried, corn or rice flour based tortilla patties stuffed with meat and cheese, pork and beans or just cheese. This dish comes with a side of shredded cabbage in a homemade vinegar & lime dressing. So. Effing. Good. Then I would recommend an order of Tamales de Elote. There are two in one order and perfect for sharing. This is a corn based, buttery tamale served with cream on the side that has a slightly sweet taste to it. It's very soft and buttery to the taste. This could probably also be eaten as a dessert but it complements the flavor of the pupusa and cabbage salad so well. To drink, I would order one of their traditional beverages like Horchata (cocoa flavored, slightly milky drink) or Tamarindo (beverage made from Tamarind). Their milkshakes are also incredibly flavorful and delicious. iBuén provecho!"

Pupusas are lightly pan fried, corn or rice flour based tortilla patties stuffed with meat and cheese, pork and beans or just cheese. This dish comes with a side of shredded cabbage in a homemade vinegar & lime dressing. So. Effing. Good. Then I would recommend an order of Tamales de Elote. There are two in one order and perfect for sharing. This is a corn based, buttery tamale served with cream on the side that has a slightly sweet taste to it. It's very soft and buttery to the taste. This could probably also be eaten as a dessert but it complements the flavor of the pupusa and cabbage salad so well. To drink, I would order one of their traditional beverages like Horchata (cocoa flavored, slightly milky drink) or Tamarindo (beverage made from Tamarind). Their milkshakes are also incredibly flavorful and delicious. iBuén provecho!"

This would've been all good place but for one thing, I believe they overcharged me I ordered a small plate of rice beans and chicken stew which on the menu is  $7 dollars , I had as an appetizer a bean cheese papusa, $5.  I had only two beers and they charge me $24.50.  Kick myself in the butt because I didn't realize it until I got home and looked up menu.com.

But they were both the plainest pastas with absolutely no flavor! Or sauce for that matter. They were both more like tossed in a light butter. Shrimp and chicken were also tasteless. It was not tossed in the customary parmesan or had parm as the ingredient in the (extremely light?) alfredo, they used mozzarella which when cold (which it was by the time it got to us, but that's nobody's fault) the cheese becomes stiff and the whole thing just becomes hardly edible. Pizzas were great though, usual Singa's fare. I just felt like an alfredo pasta is hard to mess up so how did they get this wrong? Might give another try in the future. Might."

646,CSwtvcFXNd4j8C72k2lWlQ,4/25/2015,4 star rating,"Been ordering here for the past two years. Love the crispiness of the crust and how ""bite-sized"" the pie seems. Despite the small 10"" size, one pie is already enough to make you full. Generous and fresh toppings. The best time to eat the pizza is when it's straight out of the oven. If it gets cold, you'll feel depressed trying to finish it because chewing it after awhile will make your teeth feel sore. Anyways, I recommend the pineapple topping no matter what! You could never go wrong with pineapple! :))This place, however, isn't just about the pizza! They also have spaghetti and various sandwiches too. Although I didn't order any sandwiches, I did order a Meatball Spaghetti. It came with a cute little crunchy breadstick. The noodles tasted like the dried whole wheat ones you could buy at the supermarket. The sauce tasted like it came from a can. The presentation and flavors were good, but not the best. The staff is courteous but sometimes rude. There was this one time when the guy who was taking my order was confused and then he muttered something in his language. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to cause a scene. I recommend that you don't order from here too often; you'll get tired of it. But the food is still pretty good."

Wait time is a little longer than fast food joints because (supposedly) food is all made to order and not sitting under heat lamps. Vanilla shake was TOO thick. Took about 20 minutes before I was able to slurp it through the straw. Ordered the double cheese burger which was tasty. Onions are raw. Fries are tasty and fresh. The tables are disgusting. Floor is in need of sweeping and through mopping. The garbage can was over stuffed and liquid was oozing out. Really gross place to actually eat in. Had to wipe down the table with napkins and hand sanitizer, which they have and is free. Thank God.

The last time I was here, I made the mistake of coming here in the early afternoon on a school day. The place was full of high schoolers who just sat in class for the last 6 hours and needed  to let loose. That means loud, rude, and disrespectful teenagers who will shamelessly ask strangers for money because they are high schoolers. I've come here before on Sundays when it was calmer. The staff is usually friendly, but they are really stingy with their sauces. They will charge 50 cents for a packet of ranch. As for the quality of the food, this is a fast food joint so don't expect anything more than that. I will say that their burgers are better than McDonald's or Burger King, but still pretty gross. If you're a high schooler, this place would be a decent hangout after school. If you're not a high schooler, stay away."

I would rather drink be served in regular sized cup and taste like Coke. I was not expecting gourmet but I was expecting it to have some taste. This was take out.

655,OOQ0KQe6sSQ2PhsmNUjv_g,10/8/2013,2 star rating,Food is good but try to avoid dining in. The tables are always dirty and the floors are sticky. It's not like the place is packed and they are lacking staff. The bottom line is poor work ethic. It's evident by the managers attitude. He was an older man who was more interested in playing with his young employee rather than cleaning the eating area. It really makes me sad to see the lack of customer service in businesses. There's such a decline in work ethic these days.

I believe they fry the wings first and then dip them in delicious bbq sauce. Comes with 5 wings French fries and a drink for about $8.00.Also, must try the loaded French fries. Ranch, Bacon and Cheese. A meal runs from 6-12$ depending on what you get. This location, get's rowdy sometimes because of the school kids. Most of the time there is no where to sit!     :("

The Big Buford and the Fully Loaded Fries. Big Buford in comparison is a Big Mac, but with better meat and portions. The Loaded Fries is basically fries with cheese, ranch dressing and bacon. A good place, however there are negatives to this place. Come lunch time the place gets crowded and the inside is the size of a small bodega. So eating in is out of the question. Parking there is terrible so, driving there is a downside. When I went there I missed the Drive Thru like twice. Reason being is that they share the drive thru with Dunkin Donuts. You would have to drive thru Dunkin Donuts to get to Checkers Drive thru on the way out. Not many checkers around so its a bit of a hike to pick up a burger. So if you are in the area. planning to grab and go and not stay, this is a place to eat, otherwise keep walking."

The crowd was not pretentious by all means.  The drinks were reasonable price and they offer happy hour as well.  Food is available all though I did not order any.  Plenty of seating aside from the bar area.  We sat in a small section reserved in the back. The music was good I must say I enjoyed myself.  For those worried about safety, which was not my concern, there is a nice bouncer out front who checks you ID to keep away those under age drinkers."

We weren't offered menus or food items or told of any specials, but we had already eaten dinner so weren't hungry for food. We wanted libations! My friend ordered a beer and I ordered a Moscow mule, and the total came to $17. We did not receive a receipt so I am not sure the breakdown of the cost, but it seems reasonable for a New York bar. The bar has seats for a good 12-15 people. There are also tables and little nooks for intimate seating.The bathroom is not labeled and not intuitive. It's just an unmarked door on the left side past the bar. There is graffiti throughout the walls inside of the bathroom, which is a shame because the rest of the bar is unsullied.Great place for a postdinner drink (or two or three)."

And on the huge spectrum of things you don't like to do that you have to do anyway, eating chocolate is way, WAY on the good side. In fact, it's so far to the side that it's essentially not on the list. So suck it up, and stop being such a baby. Anyway, you know who likes chocolate? My wife. And my family. And my friends. And probably your wife, and family, and friends. Basically everyone, which makes this a great place to buy gifts, and bring dates.It's getting cold, so you can warm up with several different types of hot cocoa (spiced and classic are winners), and even an iced version if you're into that. No one was ever sad about an affogato either. The desserts are also on point; puddings, mousses, homemade ice cream, that black bottom butterscotch thing...a good choice for after dinner at a nearby spot. They even serve booze, because sugar alone isn't going to be enough for you to get lucky.And there are tons of truffles, cakes, peanut butter cups, chocolate covered everything, and just straight chocolate that you can buy and give to all the people in your life that think chocolate is the best thing since sliced bread. I'll take sliced bread more often than not, but when I come in here, I can get down with the brownie sundae, or the chocolate chip cookie. Simple, classic, good. Chocolate._____________*In fact, it's a primary reason my father thinks I'm the mailman's kid, and he's threatened to disown me over it. However, from what my mom tells me, the mailman really liked chocolate too. They spent a lot of time together...must've been good friends."

It's thick and rich and absolutely delicious. We love it so much that we've actually ordered full custom cakes on numerous occasions like birthdays and parties.  They also have drinks that pair great with the desserts. The only downside is the potential wait times. The place isn't large and it is near a movie theater. So if you show up at the wrong time, you will have to wait.

Nothing on the website or their Instagram indicated that the indoor dining would be closed, so we pretty disappointed. It was also 20 degrees outside, so outdoor dining wasn't an option. We traveled about 40 minutes to check this place out, and get dessert after dinner. I checked their menu online and saw that they offered beer and wine, and even had suggestions for pairings with their desserts. We were so disappointed to not be able to have a drink and dessert after coming to the area specifically for it, and frustrated that it wasn't noted anywhere I searched online. We ended up getting some chocolates and a hot sipping chocolate to go, which were a little pricey but definitely delicious! Overall, great products, just super disappointed with the lack of communication that the dining room is closed and drinks aren't served. I hope The Chocolate Room can make a comeback to it's pre-covid status, and offer boozy drinks and indoor dining soon! I understand that places are understaffed, or can't reopen fully due to covid restrictions, but it's super disappointing that they won't communicate those changes in service to their patrons."

TCR has all the makings of a niche dessert spot. It really does. Judge the book by its cover and then some. The chocolate layered cake is backed by Oprah herself as they freely self-advertise. Oh man. That cake was light as air with alternate layers saturated with a perfect amount of chocolate sauce yielding the moistest mouth-worthy bites wrapped in uber creamy chocolate icingg I'd ever had the pleasure of eating. Yes, that is an awful run-on sentence but needing to be twice as long to describe the depth of this subtle cake. It really is to die for. The chocolate mousse dome. Man. It is delectable and also standout. Semisweet chocolate coating melts into your palate to reveal a 2 inch whipped heavy cream mousse flavored with their in house, one of a kind chocolate. Between the cream and the cake is a layer of hazelnut flour and caramel mousse. The base is the flourless cake that's reminiscent of brownie dough and denser than the layered cake. The hot chocolate espresso was spot-on even while shot like a bat out of chocolate oblivion wishing never to have to come back. It was a certain catastrophic chocolate conundrum of 1000%."

I went with the chocolate cake (because how could a place called The Choc Room have a bad chocolate cake?) and an espresso.Eeek. I was wrong. The espresso was so bad that my ancestors probably began rolling around in their graves. No froth, no flavor... probably made from instant espresso mix. The cake wasn't terrible but it definitely wasn't the top notch quality stuff that I remember from this shop. Maybe it was an off night, or maybe the quality has declined in recent years. I'm not sure.Either way, I definitely would advise against ordering coffee from here. Stick to the sundaes and ice cream which still seem to be crowd pleasers."

Store is still fairly clean, with three people working and no customer sitting in. Got my drink within 5 mins and left. Staff were nice and asked if i wanted my drink in a bag. When i got home, i dropped the drink within the bag on the floor. It was a small drop. That small drop caused a large cut on the cup and my drink started leaking. I was shocked and surprised this happened to a $7 drink. Drinks from kung fu or tiger sugar never had this before. I dropped those drink hard on the ground too. Not sure if i'll go again but the drink was diff from other bubble tea spots."

The interior was decorated with festive Lunar New Year decor, and we ordered on a self-serving kiosk. The wait was around 10 minutes I would say. I ordered a sesame yogurt, and my friend ordered a mango yogurt. I would definitely say that a fruit flavor would be more complementary with the yogurt because it is a little more sour than American yogurt. One drink was around $7, which is quite expensive, but the yogurt is also very filling. I would definitely come again!"

Wouldn't recommend.Jujube Purple Rice Yogurt - 4 starsTastes like a healthy dessert. Has a thick texture and very filling. I can definitely see myself having this for breakfast.Mango Pomelo Sago Yogurt- 5 starsA healthy version of the mango pomelo sago with yogurt. What more do I need to say? Got less sugar for all drinks above."
685,YKiR0O6ysEa1ukUBONvJSA,6/17/2022,4 star rating,Some of the drinks are hit or miss here. But I recommend the avocado drink and highly recommend the mango pomelo sago drink. I don't recommend the passion fruit one. The drinks are healthy and refreshing.

I asked the woman at the cashier how long they've been open and she told me they've been open for ten days now.I ordered the mango yogurt and the honeydew smoothie. My boyfriend and I were the only ones in there besides the workers however there were also delivery drivers coming in to pick up orders as well. Got the drinks in about 10 minutes and they have a machine that calls out your order number.The mango yogurt drink is creamy and tart, and I liked chewing on the mango bits. They use all fresh fruit and have a fridge with all their fruits they use. The honeydew smoothie was really good and has green tea in it as well. I'd come back here to try other drinks on the menu."

They made the order that was placed after mine before completing my order. I ordered 2 drinks and the group after me ordered 3 drinks. And the drink I was waiting for was also the same as one of the 3 drinks. When I asked why I couldn't take the drink since they're the same, the worker kept saying because it's not my order number.. and eventually said they have different sugar levels. Still does not explain why the 3 drinks were made before mine. No apology for wasting my time. Instead, I was asked if I wanted their order or what I ordered. WHAT??Another worker was also just standing around and not helping out.AND to top it off, I received a straw that was split at the point so couldn't actually use it! The straws are wrapped in paper, so I didn't know until I already left.Taste: Beijing yogurt tastes good. I like the red bean and black sesame. Jujube was too tough.Price: Pricey side"

The cheese on the cheese fries isn't my favorite but for some reason I couldn't stop ordering them. The portion of celery & bleu cheese could be bigger ....... but the BLAZIN BBQ sauce is spectacular & makes up for the small portion. Quick , friendly service! Definitely a Brooklyn Gem!

691,0fGUIqu6b2ZS-4amMt3Vyw,1/10/2019,4 star rating,"Location is very small. Minimal seating is offered here but there is seating. I wouldn't dine in a group though.You place your order via a self order kiosk. It wasn't immediately clear as they also have a cashier's station to the right but it wasn't in use. I'm actually pretty sure the woman making the food was the only employee there this late morning.Placing orders are pretty simple and they allow you to type in your name so that they call that out rather than the order or the order number.The food was handed to me in decent time. It smelled good and enticing. I got it to go and so I ended up eating it at home.I had more fries than I really needed but they were delicious! The wings - I got the lemon pepper rub 5 piece combo which included the aforementioned fries - they were nice. I think they were fried hard (which is an option on the ordering site) and so I needed them out maybe 4 minutes earlier than the actual cook time used.I would eat from here again. I did not see any breading whatsoever on the wings, which I love because I can't handle large amounts of gluten at this point. I'll update tomorrow if I see any gluten signs - but that'd be more my fault than anything. I was seriously hungry this morning!The only unpleasant part was the lady with a beard who was panhandling in the store. The cook/cashier absolutely shut that down though within 4 minutes and I'm grateful.BTW, they have separate tip jars. One for the cook, and one for the cashier. Nice touch. It also smelled like food and not like people, so I'm satisfied.Stop in and give them a shot."

693,0fGUIqu6b2ZS-4amMt3Vyw,10/29/2020,1 star rating,I use to like this place alot. So much that I went out of my way from NJ and ensured I stopped by while im Brooklyn. However my last two trips have completely changed my mind. My previous trip the lack of customer service and just pure rudeness was unlike Ive ever seen before. I tried to give them another shot and this was the iceing on the cake. I ordered mild wings and lemon pepper wings I got in my car and decided let me grab one of my lemon pepper wings. Only to find out they gave me hot wings instead. So I had to drive 20 mins back to the place as I dont eat hot wings. I get there Nd show the girl my reciept and the wrong wings they gave me. For hygienic reasons and with the who pandemic thing I expected her to through them in the trash and also have my wings i ordered waiting. My wings were not there and they told me id have to wait for them to be made which takes time but worst of all instead of tossing the hot wings she put them on the rack with the other food they were preparing to serve. Meaning they planned to give those to the next customer that ordered hkt wings absolutely gross. I ended telling them just firget the whole thing and got a refund

697,0fGUIqu6b2ZS-4amMt3Vyw,10/2/2019,1 star rating,So again I only come here because the wings are organic. The workers seem to not really care. But I called when I was 20-3mins away to place a order. I get here and it's not ready. Then she says the POS is down. After just standing there for a few mins I ask her how long u til it's back up. She said she honestly don't know. She said I had to reorder on the kiosk. She ordered for me then for another person who came in after me.For some reason the order I originally had was $14 over the phone I asked her twice. Now on the kiosk it's $18. I was too annoyed so I paid for it. It's one thing to talk to people who care to fix it but to talk to workers who could care less it's a waste of time. I guess the manager came and she didn't make any apologizes either. The guy after me who ordered the same thing as me and more got his order first - like right away. So I'm assuming they give him my order. So I had to wait more. I asked the manager how long and she said 4 mins. Overall I waited for 10-15 mins for food I ordered a half ago prior. When I got my food I intended on speaking to the manager but I saw it was a waste of time. I didn't get any blue cheese/ ranch or celery so I asked and and she said we don't have any. That was it...no apologies or anything. BTW Someone had ordered on the kiosk and wanted to pay cash she told him she couldn't take order. Not sorry so you have a different form of payment. Nothing WHY ARE YALL HIRING people WHO DO NOT CARE TO RUN YOUR BUSINESS?!As a multi business owner I'm in shocked that there's all these bad reviews and nothing has changed. I want my money and time back. This place is soooo our of my way.. a hour from where I live. I shouldn't have to deal with this.

The fish was fresh and savory, the breading was just right-not too much or too little, or crumbly at all. The cocktails are something to be admired as well, they have the freshest made frozen passion fruit and strawberry margaritas I have had in NY. God bless the bar tenders. The service there is 2nd to none, everyone is extremely friendly and quick with anything you need, if you need anything, they will probably be around to offer it before you even ask. They are on top of it there. The atmosphere feels warm and inviting compared to the other one in queens which shares the same name. This is the better one to go to. I will most definitely be back and always recommend this to people who are going to NY and spending time in queens."

At first glance I though this place looked wonderful with a native design. They have a great menu with lots to choose from. I had rice with chicken and salad. In the middle of eating a roach crawled onto the table, I was crazy enough to still sit there and finished my dinner. Now when I was almost done eating I noticed a few bags of trash. I will not be coming back to this restaurant again in the future."

While it's one of many ""Pollo Mario"" restaurants in the area, this one wins us for being a single block from our door.We shared a platter which I think had Mario in the name (#35 on the menu I think) and it was EASILY enough for us to share AND have some to take home. The steak was soft and good. The pork loin as well was moist. The half chicken was honestly jumping off the bone moist and tender. The cheecharonnes(sp?) were yummy/crunchy/awesome. I'm honestly not sure if you're meant to eat just the nibs or the part they come attached to, but the part I had was delicious. I gave my husband the corn cake and plantain (since I'm not a big fan of those) and we shared the salad starter and the rice/beans plate. They had thousand island dressing already on the table, which is one we like, so the salad was alright; for iceberg salad. (Though I got confused by the salad having a slice of beet and many peas on it.)My husband was a fan of the ""very spicy"" hot sauce we got when asked. We were seated behind a birthday party that was wrapping up, which means were were RIGHT next to the kitchen door and under a television. I could do without the noise and banging of the kitchen, but the food was worth tolerating it this one time."

This was one of my down days and my friends knew what I wanted on my only down day of the trip. Man oh man was OB the spot to be. Most places have good food but the drinks suck. OB was the exception, the drink was strong and the crabs were seasoned so freaking well.I typically order extra crabs when ever I go to a crab spot, you never know the portion size place to place. OB had this covered, more than enough so I definitely got my bang for my bucks. The staff was very attentive, nice and literally checked on us several times.On my next trip, trust this is on my list of places."

The delivery was quick and clean! I ordered the mesclun salad, lobster mac & cheese, and snow crab boil with a side of garlic noodles.The salad and dressing was fine, and the lobster mac & cheese was great! I got the snow crab boil with the boil seasoning - spicy - and the garlic noodles and they were good, but the flavor was a bit too sweet. The quality was great, but the seasoning being a bit too sweet is what dropped a star. This is definitely one of the better boils I've had in the city, but I still have my favorite location elsewhere."

We sat outside and I have to say the outdoor situation is actually quite nice, I like it more than the indoor. It was a beautiful night though so that helped a lot. My only two complains are this time my crab legs didn't break apart so easily, the meat was stuck inside so I had to really rip it out.  Therefore that means cooking went wrong or food not being fresh. Nonetheless it was cooked and still delicious. And also there was a lot of mosquitos around. Perhaps citronella candles or something should be laid out? Still love the place though and will definitely dine there again."

They deliver, and the experience of getting a boil delivered was definitely a plus. The shrimp were either overcooked or previously frozen as the skin was very difficult to peel. Crawfish had a lot of muck inside them, and I wasn't a fan of the boil sauce, I thought it needed more garlic and spices. The batter on the fried catfish was flaky but bland, while the mayo it came with had a really overpowering flavor. Onion rings were good but they came with a sweet chili sauce which didn't really compliment them. The gumbo is probably one of the better ones I've had in NY- it's not full of tomato, but it was more like a gravy with mushy vegetables."

( Beautiful backyard by the way!)Ok so we had Lauren as our server. She was quick, attentive and knowledgeable. Everything you could want in a server. Next the appetizers. I had the chili with melted mozzarella. It was Hardy and Rich. Extremely pleasing to the palate. My wife had the split pea soup which was from her account delicious. For my main course I had the steak fajita in a white wrap, she had the chicken kabob starter. Both were excellent!!! Being a restaurant owner myself I'm usually very critical.

The mozzarella wasn't even fresh it came from a bag mostly pre shredded. The Ceasar dressing was extremely salty. The 1/2 of avocado wasn't ripe. And the best part of all the chicken was RAW!

The bento came with a nice amount of flavorful rice, salad, some kind of vegetable set, pickled veggies, a salad and the main.

Unfortunately it then took 10 minutes to get water and 15 before a waitress came to our table (and the one next to ours) for the first time. It gets busy here and depending on when you're seated could mean a significant wait. We ordered the beef kakuni appetizer, fresh made tofu, and two sushi rolls. The tofu here is really incredible! Firm but somehow delicate at the same time. The soy sauce and ginger that comes with it is a perfect flavor. This was my favorite dish and it comes in a beautiful jar. The beef kakuni appetizer was tender, flavorful but just so small! Really just a few bites. The sushi rolls were OK and probably not the right thing to order here. Hibino is a lovely place with a unique style. But the price for value (I ended up having a second dinner) and inconsistency of service were notable as well"

The sashimi plate and spicy tuna rolls were fresh and generously sized. The waiters were attentive and quick.

736,d8qCvlsG3jwxQPZc_OGogQ,10/3/2016,3 star rating,"Came here on a Saturday night with a few friends last weekend. The wait wasn't too long given that we showed up at 8pm (only about 30 minutes), and the ambiance was great, but the food was very average for Japanese food in NY. We ordered two obanzai to start with: one was a pork meat sauce with noodles, and the other was a sort of tofu gratin. The tofu dish was very unusual and didn't taste or seem like tofu at all. It wasn't bad, just not something I'm used to. The noodles dish had a good and simple flavor. It tasted like something my mom would make! We ordered various combinations of sushi, which were again fine but not incredible. The temperature of the rice was off and the presentation could have been better. Overall I had a good experience at the restaurant, but I wouldn't rush to go back."
737,d8qCvlsG3jwxQPZc_OGogQ,7/8/2017,5 star rating,This is a lovely little authentic Japanese restaurant serving traditional Japanese style tapas. The special menu serves various original creations of the day. The menu has a plethora of sushi from the standard maki rolls to more elaborate sushi rolls.The restaurant is cozy you can see the chefs preparing your meal from your table. There is a bar as well where you can enjoy a more up close personal review of the chefs. Waitresses were attentive. Food was excellent! Def try the SABA!!

I can't think of a better sushi restaurant in a 20 block radius! We usually stick to the traditional roles but we usually try one of there ever changing special menu items. They rotate daily and offer unique, traditional (and not so traditional) Japanese starters. Each are delicious and great to share with others.Give this place a try; you won't be disappointed!!"

They were very accommodating and honored our reservation even though we were a bit late. Our waitress was the sweetest. To eat, I had the crispy vegan quinoa and artichoke burger. It was tasty. The burger ""patty"" was quite soft, but it didn't feel too mushy like veggie burgers can sometimes be. I loved the fresh avocado on it. The subtle dressing on the arugala side salad was also really good. The pickled onions on the salad were nice and tangy. My friend tried the watermelon lemonade and liked it. She got it without alcohol, but it can also be ordered with prosecco. Definitely a great option for a casual meal."

I got the chicken sandwich and right when I got it I tried to take the top bun off to put pickles on it but then I accidentally dropped the bun on the ground. I ate it anyways. I told my friend it dropped face up so it was fine (that was a lie). Despite all of the above it was still delicious. I would come back!

Instead of and English muffin they are served on fried potato cakes. He did not care for them.We returned two days later for dinner. I had the Hebrew special, two Hebrew National hot dogs and fries. The hot dogs did not taste very much like the Hebrew National dogs I've had in the past. Also, my partner had the chicken tenders as a main dish and told me they were cold. The drinks were odd. I had a Margarita on the rocks and my partner had one straight up. Mine was OK and fairly generous, but the straight up was in the smallest martini glass I have ever seen. About 3 ounces at the most. All in all the meal was not worth the $61 it cost."

We got the market plate (all the picks tasted fairly good), veggie chili, and quinoa artichoke burger. Tried some of the veggie chili and it was delicious! I wish the portions for the market plate were a bit larger but I guess that's the point of the market plate--you get a little bit of 4 things.Hands down the best items are the DRINKS! They feel so easy to make, like you could make it at home, but something about about them was so perfect, especially the health tea and the green iced drink we got, which they made non-alcoholic for us. So minty and refreshing!"

747,MctQwL9Mp5X7DJk13VoERg,7/25/2021,3 star rating,"We came here for Saturday brunch, which was enjoyable. When making the reservation, we had the option for indoors, which we chose, or outside. Inside the seating is fairly nondescript, but all the tables and chairs can be moved around as well as individual sheets of plexiglass on stands so that tables of any size can be separated. However, if you don't mind sitting outside, I think that would be more interesting.Each of us ordered the Argentinian Eggs Benedict, because it sounded so interesting. I have no idea what makes a dish like this Argentinian, maybe it's simply ""because they say so,"" but it was indeed unique. the poached eggs (2) are on top of chorizo, which is then placed on top of hash browns instead of an English muffin. The potatoes can absorb all the juices from the chorizo and the (minimal amount of ) Hollandaise sauce. These were all consumed very quickly, and I'd definitely order them again (and again). Service was more attentive at first but never bad. We were greeted immediately, and we got our first cups of coffee quickly. I was offered milk, but when I asked if half and half was available, I was told it was and I received it. Refills were not automatic, I had to ask for one. I was slightly peeved regarding my reservation. I made the reservation on Open Table, initially for three, indoors, for my second best choice of times because it said indoor seating was not available at the other time. A few hours later, three more friends asked if they could join us, so I tried to modify the reservation. I got a message that said they only take reservations for SMALL parties.  I did not question that, I simply attributed it to restaurant size. Once I got there, not only was there ample indoor seating the entire time we were there, there was a table seating 6 behind us which was never filled. So my suggestion is if you want to try to make a reservation for a larger group, call them directly. I still consider this a fun place to have brunch, and I'd certainly return!"
748,MctQwL9Mp5X7DJk13VoERg,7/11/2021,4 star rating,"I went to Westville Chelsea for dinner and ordered the Salmon Teriyaki, which I got with green peas and bacon and seared tofu. The ingredients were high quality and were cooked pretty well. The salmon and tofu could have been more flavorful though and the sauce didn't do that much to improve the dish. That being said, it was a solid dish with ingredients that complemented each other and a solid portion size. For $23, this was a fair deal.The service speed was pretty quick and the staff were very friendly. There is an indoor seating area as well as a nice covered outdoor seating area.Overall, Westville Chelsea is a solid spot for American food with fresh ingredients (both brunch and dinner). Give it a shot if you're in the area."

The restaurant was clearly busy, as there was quite a buzz, however, my friend and I were able to sit immediately. There was seating both inside and outside, but we opted for inside given how warm it was outside. The atmosphere was bright, cool, and modern. We opened up our digital menus and picked our meals- she got a greek salad and I picked from their market vegetables groups. With this, I was able to pick 3 items from a good-sized list of options. I picked the beets with goat cheese and walnuts, pesto mashed potatoes, and the yuca fries with aioli sauce. The food was really tasty and of OK sized portion given the $13 price tag. I was a little hungry a few hours later, but it was nice to get healthy food for a pretty competitive price given New York standards. I highly recommend the pesto mashed potatoes - I have never had this combination before!"

They will buy some of your used books from you, but they are very picky about what they choose to take in and therefore likely won't take in a lot of items. Basically, the more obscure the title, the more likely they'll buy it from you, pending that said title is in good condition, of course. Staff was friendly when I had gone and their selection is well curated. Worth a peek if you happen to be in the area."

The person who helped me was the mother of the owner: very kind and helpful. She explained that ""topos"" means ""place"" in Greek. She also had a plate of cookies out for guests. There's tons of natural light, and simple and comfortable decor.They have a small selection, but it all seems very intentional. Rosa Luxemburg, Gramsci, Susan Sontag, Amiri Baraka, and lots of Marx... There's a lot of great titles to comb and they're all decently priced (prices marked in pencil in the corner of the first page); most of the books I looked at were under 10 dollars. The majority of the collection is used, but even the few new selections I saw were marked below market price."

The atmosphere here is really intellectual and playful, but not pretentious at all. It is really decorated with such care and the selection of books is like no other i've been to - you can find anthropological studies, rare anime, religious texts, and all the most fascinating contemporary literature. Beyond books, they offer really lovely loose leaf teas, they use gimme coffee beans which are fantastic, and decent scones. Also, their staff is so friendly and knowledgable, and you'll usually find them having a lively conversation with someone in the store.

760,1FVhAe5DXYHXA3qIL0oB7g,9/9/2020,1 star rating,I think this is 1 of the worst Pizza Huts I've ever come across in my attire life. I placed a online order with the pizza hut on pitkin Ave  in brooklyn on 9/6/2020 about 2:30pm and credit it to my card for a online delivery. The form ask for your phone number and email which I gave both. Got a conformation for my order. Now I wait and I waited. I waited so long I almost forgot I placed a order 2hrs goes by so I called the store to asked what happened to my order. The young lady says when you put a 1 before your number the system kicks a number off. Sorry would you like me to send the order out now it will take another 45mins to 1 hr. I said no thanks I would just like a refund. The young lady said ok no problem I will do that. Hours later I called back and spoken to the nasty rude general manager who told me they dont give refund would you like store credit. I told him no I want a refund especially that he was so rude and nasty to me why would I ever want to order from that store again.  He tells me that he has a email from cooperate that tells him not to give refunds and if I knew how to order properly I wouldn't have this problem. I asked for a regional manager and the cooperate office number so I could talk to someone he then tells me they don't have the numbers in the store and they would tell me as well that Pizza Hut doesn't give refund. So I call customer service twice asking for my refund on a order I never received and until this day I have no pizza nor did I get a refund. I also asked from someone above store level to contact me and no one has. I never experienced anything like this before.  Whoever is reading this review please please dont ever buy from this pizza hut. The store is located at 1501 Pitkin Ave Brooklyn NY 11212. PLEASE DONT ORDER FROM THEM.

NO MANAGER EVER CAME ON THE LINE. The driver finally finds me as I've been standing outside my building the entire time. So now I have the order AND THE ORDER IS WRONG!!!

The  Delivery woman called me and told me she would be there in five minutes however she wasn't there apparently she had the wrong address which I have no understanding how but anyway she claims she did and she was across the street waiting . Before I found out that she had wrong address I tried calling the Pizza Hut location three times to see what happened No ANSWER! I try calling the deliverywoman also no answer until she finally picked up on the fifth try. it's starting to get extremely cold in New York so standing out side for 30 minuets is ridiculous. After finally getting my pizza 30 minutes later not only is the pizza cold it's extremely soggy! And the delivery woman was absolutely unprofessional she started to ask about me having babies and that if I have any ""they will be kept right ""? I understand maybe her religious beliefs however it's the unprofessional to ask any customer about their personal business like that. I will not be ordering from this location again. I just got home from work and didn't feel like cooking so I thought this to be quick and easy however it was just extremely annoying!EDIT: I just checked my account and seen that I was charged two separate transactions!

It's definitely OVERRATED if you're a food connoisseur like most of us yelpers. Fried Chicken- 3/5 was mediocre and nothing special. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. Mad for Chicken, Bon Chon, Debasaki, and Pelicana are by far much better for fried chicken. Spicy Rice cake- 5/5 was very good and a must try item. If it wasn't for their spicy rice cake they would have received 2 stars. Bulgogi fried rice- 3.5/5 was good but I wouldn't recommend it or order it again.

This spot beats out a lot of sit in fried chicken spots but just needs a little more kick with their sides and sauces other than that they do have some solid dishes.

My friend on the other hand prefer wings that are super crispy.I also order the Bulgogi, it was really dry as well. (It was over cooked) I definitely had better. Overall I'm glad I tried it."

What's making me uncomfortable is that how the meal is charged. First, they charged me $17 other than $16 shown on the menu for chicken wings, then, they automatically added tip to the bill without letting me know, at last, they kept another 50cents change without asking me. I ended up paying $5 more than I expected, for 10 chicken wings. This is shady."

Delicious!!!Only reason I don't give it a 5 Star is because its a little dark and dim for the day time but it's a great spot for a night out and drinks with friends that has great food. The serving part, though, is often entirely delegated to green part-timers, which is bearable and not that significant--but with potential room for improvement."

Korean pancakes, fried cauliflower, lychee cocktails, meatless sharables, steamed buns, bulgogi are always excellent. Cons: it's gonna be full on a weekend starting at 8, and you won't see your server as often as you might be used to. Just order a shit load of food at the start. You're welcome.

The main thing that stood out to me as soon as I walked in though was the smell of the restaurant, it did not smell very fresh inside - slightly like a public bathroom which isn't too appetizing. Service itself was very efficient and quick though. We ordered our food pretty quickly after we were seated and got it in a good amount of time. To share we ordered: --Fried chicken (mixed combo): breading was delicious and flavor was good as well. Chicken was also juicy which I liked. Sauce worked really well. --Fried cauliflower: same breading and flavor as chicken. Cauliflower works surprisingly well as a substitute! --Beef bimbimbop: Pretty average bimbimbop, beef was good though! All in all, a fairly average Korean restaurant but a good meal."

I ordered the Enguday Tibs, Shiro, Misir Wot, and Yater Kik Alicha. Would come back online to try in person to see if there is a difference. The togo box is also really big. I am curious if they will have other packaging options for to go in the future."

783,l4fwf8VwAokv3MWT45Ab7g,12/28/2021,4 star rating,"Saturday afternoon, no wait at all for a table of two inside. Straightforward menu with classic Ethiopian dishes at reasonable prices.Plant based menu still has a lot to offer, especially for brunch. Settled on the Habesha Breakfast Combo ($18) and Special Ful Combo ($16) - basically one of pretty much everything they offer (aside from the choice of firfir). First off - the Kita bread is fantastic, very reminiscent of flaky paratha, just a little sweeter. Some other standouts include the Durban firfir (spicy but tempered by the cashew ergo) and the flavorful Ful. Wasn't a big fan of the Butecha, which was very dry, needing a lot of help from the other dishes.Service here is solid despite only one person manning the orders. Obviously a must visit for vegetarian or vegan eaters."

We ordered a feast for 3 and 3 orders of samosas for 6 people, which ended up being just the right amount of food.  The samosas were delicious and so was the sauce that came with them.  Out of the 9 items in the feast, I think 6 of them tasted amazing to me, but the others were not bad either.  The injera on the side was very tasty and great for grabbing food, but the injera underneath got far too soggy that it made it difficult to eat with and also a bit unpleasant itself. I don't think I could eat here too often, but I would recommend people come here to try it, especially if they've never eaten Ethiopian food before."

The wait was about 30 minutes so we went to get coffee nearby. We were seated near the back wall which allowed me to see all the decor that makes the place so warm and cozy. We ordered the shai tea, which was delicious and strong! And also ordered the e breakfast special along with the vegan scramble. Everything was so tasty. I recommend coming here on an empty stomach."

I hate to read y'all but I've about had it:  Knowing what our traditional food is like when prepared with love, and how much it means to our community, i am embarrassed that this restaurant is considered authentic. Bunna has scaled back on quality over the years. The portions are a robbery. I can get miser wot in the DMV for $10 that could last me 2 days with enough injera. Why do the sauces come in ramekins like ketchup???   None of my leafy veggies were cooked thru and my lentils were crunchy. My shiro was pretty much hummus. The injera tasted like unsweetened chewing gum. Not an ounce of seasoning.   I understand that we as immigrants choose to cut back on spices when operating in Caucasian neighborhoods. So I don't blame the establishment. I blame the patrons.. Respectfully never ordering again."

The staff was very kind and the seats were comfortable too.I ordered meal with 5 selections of items. I selected mushroom, kale, cabbage, collard green, and one of the lentil options. I'm not a vegan or vegetarian so I could never give a 5 star for vegan dish, but I can say that I enjoyed them very much. The food doesn't come with utensils so you should ask for them if you don't want to eat with your hands. I ordered iced coffee as well. I didn't read the description thoroughly so I wasn't expecting anything other than regular iced black coffee, but the coffee was actually immersion-brewed with cardamom and cloves. The cup was little smaller than expected, 1.5~2 size of espresso cup"

The plate was HUGE! My friend and I couldn't finish everything. The flavors were each super unique. Everything was vegetarian so it was also quite healthy and there was plenty of greens!We also got a smoothie (but we got the three-flavored smoothie), I like that there was no sugar added.They also gave us soup on the house which was really sweet of them.Great value for the price, really good quality flavors - would recommend!"

I especially enjoyed the variety of all the different options to each with the injera. we ordered some extra injera as we ran out, but overall was absolute delicious!!

They were patient and kind (even funny!) while we sorted out our order for 6. They offer a wide range of non-dairy milk like products like almond, oat, macadamia, and coconut. After reading so many reviews about their chai, we had to try one and found it lived up to its reputation. We got the macadamia nut milk chai and it was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy. Mmm...delicious! The baked goods were fresh and there was a larger menu of salads, sandwiches and lunch foods we hope to try another time."

Just fyi, They do not have a bathroom Btw.The eye of lychee drink tastes fresh and had real fruitThe only star I took away is cuz the Hong Kong milk tea could be stronger but other than that it's great.

It's a small restaurant that's a bit hard to find at first and you may have to wait to be seated since they only have several small tables. But they serve pretty good hot pot and noodles at reasonable prices and I usually take my food to-go. Their Little Hot Pot is a mini hot pot for one person and comes with glass noodles, veggies, meat, and tofu skin in flavorful soup. I highly recommend because it's so filling and tasty. It's a perfect comfort food especially when you want something warm and soupy."

I ordered their bam bam noodles (one of their signature noodle's). Waiting time was really good which was great since I had a class in 20 minutes. I took my first bite and it was SO SALTY. My plate was so salty I had to drink water after every bite. The flavor was there but it was unfortunately overpowered by salt/soy sauce. I had high expectations for this place but this dish destroyed that. I couldn't say anything to them since I had to leave for class ASAP. Had to order plain rice to go (small portion of rice for $2.18) I wouldn't recommend, it's not worth it."

The gentleman taking my order was friendly and offered suggestions. Ordered:Little hot pot ($9)- this bowl of vegetarian soup comes with clear glass noodles made of sweet potato (although they don't taste like sweet potato), cabbage, bok choy, wood ear mushrooms, and dry tofu skin. The broth tasted like it had soy sauce in it. It was delicious. Ramen with pork broth ($9.70)- this bowl of soup had a pork broth. It was also good but I actually preferred the vegetarian broth. This soup had traditional ramen noodles, a hard boiled egg, bok choy, cabbage and mushrooms. Hot black tea (free!)- I got a glass of black tea for free since I checked in on Yelp. This tea was very sweet which I wasn't expecting. Both soups were perfect for warming up on a cold day. They were also flavorful and filling. I will be visiting Bao Bao Cafe again soon."

I walked in with high expectations and left feeling underwhelmed.This place is very tiny and stuffy. Even though there were only two other people eating there (and eventually just my table), the service was terrible. There were three people working, one of them couldn't even answer any questions and kept saying, ""Sorry let me ask the other worker."" They also don't have a restroom and told me I could walk to Starbucks down the street if I needed to use one...As for the food, I wish they had a bigger selection on the menu. We ended up ordering one bao bao noodle and one little hot pot. I was surprised to find out that the base for the little hot pot pretty much doesn't come with anything. You have to pay for all the add ons aka meat options. The menu is a little confusing and I feel like every time we ordered something there was a catch or we had to pick something that wasn't laid out on the menu already. They pretty much used the same broth in both dishes...and not to mention our food was lukewarm which was disappointing. We also tried the chrysanthemum tea and lychee drink...like others said, it taste pretty watered down and not special for the price.I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here."

810,R0y03SFOY0BdHRUT1LSO0Q,11/25/2022,4 star rating,"We ordered the shrimp and pork soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, turnip pastries, salted tofu pudding, and shrimp rolls. Unfortunately they forgot about our shrimp rolls and told us the beef rolls would have less of a wait, so we opted for that instead. Shrimp rolls are my favorite though, so I was disappointed that we didn't try those. The service was pretty quick for the other items though. It's strange that they brought the rice noodles from outside (next door?) and over to the restaurant, which we saw as we were leaving. The soup dumplings were good, but nothing too amazing. They do have a lot of varieties to choose from, so that's nice to have options. They have large soup dumplings too that they sell individually and I was going to try one until I found out that it's only filled with soup and no meat. The turnip pastries were good, but would probably not order again. Scallion pancakes were fried and so crispy, but quite oily. Salted tofu - my first time trying, and it was very smooth and silken. One bowl was shareable between 2-3 people, and would've been too much for myself unless that was the only thing I ordered. Also a bonus they offer if you spend at least $10 on your order is an order of soup dumplings or Peking duck buns (1 piece/person). We got the duck buns, and yum. That's nice to offer. Ambiance was nice with the decor. However I felt quite rushed by the servers in ordering and eating. I didn't feel like I could really relax because they were always moving and bustling, and seemed rushed for us to leave even though there wasn't a line and plenty of other tables. So overall an okay experience because of that."
811,R0y03SFOY0BdHRUT1LSO0Q,2/24/2023,4 star rating,I only got the duck bun so my review is solely based on that. I thought the piece of duck they gave was juicy with a really nice crunch skin. Really tasty for a snack and it made me want to see what the restaurant is like. I ordered the bun to go and it came out pretty fast. Not sure I'd make the trek out to Flushing for this but a spot to hit for sure next time I'm back.

Their highlight is their free soup dumplings, which comes free after ordering $10 worth of food. I'm always about their breakfast & a la carte foods, a typical meal would have fried dough paired with soy milk, then scallion pancakes with beef, shao mai, rice with chicken wrapped in bamboo. What gets me coming back is not only how affordable the meal is, but we always leave full and satisfied. Highly recommend! TIP: CASH ONLY!"

They were also giving out a free order of XLB when you spend over $10, which is an incredibly great deal! The staff are always around and quite attentive, so it's easy to get someone's attention when you need it. Also, they seem to be cash only right now. Pan Fried Noodle with Shredded Pork: The noodles were so crispy even when covered with the sauce. The sauce had a very deep flavor, in a good way, it was also not too salty which I liked. The pork and mushrooms were tasty as well. The perfect amount of vegetables complement all the pork in this dish. Soup Dumplings (XLB) with Pork: The skin was very thin which I love! The pork inside was tasty and had a nice texture to it. I'd have to say that the skin was a bit more sticky than I'd prefer it to be. Sweet Tofu Pudding: Super good, a great way to round out the dinner. It was not too sweet and very silky in texture. I could eat multiple bowls of this in a sitting. No complaints here on this. Great food at great prices. Would definitely stop by again."

The food was very fresh. The xiao long bao is very flavorful and juicy. The scallion pancake sliced beef was crunchy, but I have to say that Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao is better.

The staff were accommodating, but i took away one star because there were like black dust or particles floating from above our table; when we told the staff, they were quick to move us to another table and apologized, saying the black stuff came from the A/C above. Other than that minor setback, the food were delicious; i got most of the recommendations from the Tiktok video, like the multi-colored soup dumplings and the pork and veggie dumpling in chili peanut sauce (it wasn't that spicy that's why i liked it). My husband got the Crispy stir-fried Seafood Noodle, and it was oh so good, it was not too salty and it had that tasty Umami flavor. Their Shanghai style Shu Mai was also good. They have this promotion that if our order went beyond $10, we get a free item, either soup dumplings or the Peking Duck buns; we got the Peking duck buns. Even if they were small and the slices were thin, the bun and the garnish and condiment made up for it, and it made us feel full right away lol they also offered a complimentary dessert, a sweet soup with glutinous rice balls and goji berries, it was not too sweet, which suited us fine. Our bill was also reasonable; for 3 people, it was less than $50. Over-all, this is our new go-to place!"

Not the absolute best duck and given a bit too much sauce but for the price it tasted really good. INSTAGRAM WORTHY (4/5): We got takeout but there's a window facing forward the sidewalk where you can see the ducks! Neon signs at night give it that old school Chinatown vibe. SERVICE (4/5): I speak around 7 words of Chinese but I was able to get around. You order inside at the cashier and let them know you want to go. Keep your receipt and wait outside for the uncle to hand you your order from the street. TAKEAWAYS: Definitely worth a visit if you're doing a flushing food crawl! Inexpensive and quick!

I've been here many times over the past two years or so and have never been disappointed. We always have the same waiter, and he is attentive and kind. I always order the same dish - the gnocchi con formaggio (with three cheeses and a walnut garnish). I am a huge fan of gnocchi and this is one of the best ones I've had. My husband likes trying new dishes every time, and he has loved everything he's had, including the salmone dish (with roasted potatoes and vegetables) pictured. Also, not only are they BYOB, which is already a huge plus, they go the extra mile, provide nice wine glasses, bring a stand with ice to chill your white wine, and make sure your glass is always full.

Best arancini in the area for sure. BYOB policy is nice for in-person, though sometimes service can be a bit slow with a single waiter. No big deal though. Lately we have been doing takeout. I recommend the squid ink linguini with shrimp. . Always arrives fast and hot. Keep it up!"

The oolong express was my favorite out of the 2! It had a strong flavor but was also refreshing at the same time. Service was great! Would highly recommend!!

I cant put my finger on how the place exactly feels because it felt like I was in a wooden cabin but at a rich person's log cabin. Food is very lifted classy food such as salad, charcuterie, and few sandwich options. We ordered the roasted duck which iny opinion very very gamey and I did not like. The cheese was very good and standard for what it is. The charcuterie all comes with crostini's, grapes and olives. Im not an olive fan either but the rest of that is very good. Toasted Daniele was probably the best of what we ordered. It's savory, crispy, and so good I'd get it again. The lobster roll is good but it's small and for $27 it honestly was not ground breaking. The rose cider was so good! It came in a bottle but it was the perfect blend of rose and cider which was really refreshing. Overall it's ok. I'd have to give it another go maybe."

We came here on a weekday evening, and it was not very crowded by the time we arrived around 6pm. We ordered two cocktails - I Don't Want No Shrubs and The Smoking Shaman. Both drinks taste good. In terms of food, we ordered oysters, smoked duck, and the toasted Daniele (tartine topped with prosciutto, ham, piave, cilantro). They have $1 oyster happy hour Tuesday - Friday from 4-7pm which is a great deal. It's hard to find $1 oyster in NYC these days given the inflation. The oysters are fresh and delicious. I also like the toasted Daniele. It's flavorful.I like the decor and ambience here. It's a great spot for dating and hanging out with friends. The food definitely exceeded my expectations given that it's a speakeasy bar. The food and drinks here are also more affordable compared to Manhattan, and it's only one stop away from midtown Manhattan which is very convenient."

I probably won't go back.My friend just moved to LIC so we decided to check out local restaurants. Called in advance to reserve a table for Happy Hour, and the gentleman over the phone was perfectly nice -- he reserved a table for us and seated us when we arrived. No problems there.Shortly after (young gentleman wearing a backwards cap) approached us. ""Who said you could sit here?? This table is reserved."" We explained, but it was all very odd and unnecessary. The restaurant wasn't even full.That same server later took our order with a thick condescending attitude. My friend ordered a beer, and the server hit back with ""The draft isn't working. You need to pick something in a bottle or can."" Okay, fine... but when asked to clarify what was available or suggest the bottle/can alternative, he just stared my friend and said ""Bottle or can"" again like as if we know what's behind the bar.I jumped in to order some oysters and buy some time to look at the drink menu again, but the experience was soured. Before this happened, we were excited to try the dinner menu, but decided we really didn't want to deal with the server and would rather leave for somewhere else.We finished quickly. I asked for the check and the server hurriedly shoved the payment system in my face. I didn't even get to see an actual bill -- he just rushed to the tip screen, and I ended up tipping 18% just because it was the lowest number available on the screen and I wanted so badly to get out of there.He deserved $0.00I don't expect to return."

It's beneath the owner to treat clients in this manner. Today I stopped in to get a quick bite to go and it took half an hour and a *reminder* to get a charcuterie board. There were maybe four other tables in the restaurant so it was not busy inside to the extent that getting crostini, meats and cheese into some boxes would take a half hour. I looked back at the kitchen and saw the guy who took our order doing dishes even though I was clearly looking towards the kitchen after 20+ minutes. Just kept washing dishes and ignored me. I'm not going back, Beast. And it's your loss because I was a supporter during the pandemic. And always tipped 20%. But not today. So don't try to shame me in your responses (I've read some of your responses to other people)."

We enjoyed sitting at the bar, the bartender made a mean old fashioned. Nice chill atmosphere, great place to either spend the evening or for a night cap to finish the night off!! Their kitchen is literally a tiny spot to your left as soon as you walk in, next to the bar, hence why their menu is oysters and charcuterie plates. We saw the place during the day before it was opened and you wouldn't of even thought it was in business but the place totally transforms by opening time!"

The portion size is a third of any other location and they are out of basic ingredients a lot. Do the workers supply the ingredients out of their own pockets? I've actually moved to just making my own salads because I feel robbed whenever coming here. Whoever is managing the place should be fired.

I arrived to pick up my bowl at 7:53 when the staff informed me that they didn't have any rice and hadn't had rice all day long. I get it if you run out of something seasonal but rice? Oh and no quinoa to substitute Not only did they not think to let me know in the FIVE hour span from me ordering to me picking up, but when I arrived they hadn't made ANYTHING.  I pre-ordered because I knew I would be in between clients and wanted to easily grab and go. The woman behind the counter, her name was Nicole, was VERY rude. She went and got her manager unprompted and said ""you deal with her because I can't"" in reference to me, the customer. The manager apologized and made me my salad minus the rice. I still had to pay full price (it was pre-paid) The worst part? They put something in there that triggered an allergy attack for me. I only ate less than half before I started breaking out all over. I will NEVER visit this location again and I would like my money refunded. I've already reported this to corporate."

But recently I've noticed that the service and cleanliness has gone far downhill. There were two people preparing meals tonight, one doing online orders and one servicing the people in line. So for a 10 person line, it was roughly a 15+ minute wait. The food counter was messy. They were missing about 8-10 ingredients. So it was basically an invent-your-own-bowl type of situation. The employees were not happy campers. See the attached photo. Not sure what else there is to say."

When I pointed it out she reached in, grabbed most of the handful and pulled it out, and then just kept going. There was visible chicken still in the salad! When I pointed it out she grabbed one piece she could see and then told me she'd gotten it all...spoiler alert, she did NOT get it all. The cashier could not have cared less. The right thing to do, obviously, was to MAKE THE SALAD AGAIN, but since that didn't even occur to anyone I'll just stop coming to this location. Vegetarians and those with food allergies beware!!"

I go quite often purely out of the convenience of the location and I don't think they've once remembered to put all the ingredients from a menu item into the bowl. I've learned to memorize the ingredients and watch and make sure they put it all in. Starting to think they aren't forgetting and just do it on purpose to save money...? Quality is also worse than other sweetgreens and the people working there are so rude and clearly hate their jobs. The guy ringing me up today didn't even say anything, just put the salad in front of me and pointed at the card machine. Super disappointing because I've had great experiences at other locations!"

When it was time to pay I don't know what even happened but it was something with the register (the employee was giggling and called someone for help..have no idea what was so funny of me standing there for 10 minuets waiting but ok...)Then I realized that a freakin' salad cost 15$ (!!!)My first and last time!!! To charge 15$ for a salad with a few pieces of tofu is just crazy. And the bad attitude of the employees definitely didn't help."

I'm sitting at the counter waiting to order for like an uncomfortable amount of time  while 4 employees are sitting there gossiping, checking their nails, and just staring at me, not doing a damn thing. There's seriously no way all of them were clocked out or on a break. And then when I leave because I have places to be they all start laughing on my way out. Super childish and sort of unreal behavior. I get it, customer service and fast casual dining are tough but like, at least try. If you have a ton of time to kill and want to be served food at a sloths pace with rude attitude this is the spot for you."

There are either zero or 1 ppl behind the  assembly line. Always with a hateful attitude, bad work ethic, and lazy energy. I am part of the problem bc I keep returning every few months hoping it will improve. This company is making huge profits off online orders and  obviously does not care about individual in person interactions/experiences.  If anyone  with any authority in the sweetgreen corp ever bothers to read this...SHAME ON YOU!"

My adult daughter had reserved two tables for a birthday party there on Saturday . The outdoor space was blazing hot and the young lady who was working there insisted we couldn't have those tables in the shade because a party of twenty was coming later . We honestly never saw a party of twenty show up and later in the afternoon moved to tables in the shade . Wit the exception of a wonderful waiter who took our orders and checked on us frequently we found it to be really lacking in service . We had spent easily over 500 dollars there during the afternoon - before I left one waitress asked me repeatedly to clear out so another group could come.  People seemed to enjoy the drinks and the food, but there is no hospitality or warmth from the staff there - it's def not a place to have a birthday celebration there .

852,c6aQNxYlU1IeRrgSIZj6iw,9/22/2020,3 star rating,"The current menu appears mostly Tex Mex. I am one of those fussy only ""only eat Mexican food in Mexico"" eaters, who is hard to please. Yet, I'll take guacamole and tequila anywhere. One taco is rather small and costs $6. When it comes to tacos,  I judge them by this cart that parks outside of Elsewhere, so please consider the source. Cuomo's odd law about having to eat ""a sufficient amount of food"" while drinking is too confusing to follow...might just be better to eat home alone until this city FULLY reopens and we don't have to worry about Cuomo's fines or Covid.To stay safe during Covid, Parklife requires you to log onto their website and do all orders from your phone (I believe with electronic payments card only). So bring a charged phone and your electronic bank information. Tips are already included, which I'm OK with. I'm not sure if Park Life will add Cuomo's 10% surcharge, which could be a deal breaker. In Park Slope, some restaurant owners think the 10% surcharge is ""stupid""...we will see what happens. I enjoy Park Life's outside movies, but the email reservation process is confusing (probably due to the popularity of rare outside nightlife events). Before the movie, there is usually a talented host who entertains with fun trivia that movie fans have a stab at actually getting correct answers.The actual movie ""screen"" is just a wall, so don't expect crisp and clear resolution. It's best to arrive very early to a decent seat. Wish Littlefield, which promotes ParkLife, was open! Littlefield is where you go for a fun night with Grade A Celeb comedians.Hope Park Life gets some heaters...this outside dining is getting COLD. Alas, there has been an increase in crime in this neck of the woods, so it's best to walk home with friends with eyes on the back of their heads after dark. The Union Street subway station has become a trouble spot, so might be best to just get here from the subway at Barclay's Atlantic Avenue or call Arecibo Car Service, which is very close at (718) 783-6465."

They have a no contact ordering with a QR code. First they brought water and plastic cups to the table and our food and drinks arrived shortly after we ordered them online but it wasn't a very busy day for them. I'm rating only four stars because I think the portion of guac they gave us was a bit small for the price. Other than that we were all very pleased with our drinks. There is a 2 hour table limit probably because of covid but it was more than enough for us to enjoy ourselves. Can't wait to visit this place again.

For 4$ you could have at least given me the 50c bag you can buy from the bodega. Guacamole portion was about the size of one avocado. Ordered a ginger ale for the kids but once ice was poured out it barely filled the little water cups. My 8 year old finished it in one gulp. Had to ask for the can. Same issue with the cocktails. Just went for the pitcher after quickly finishing the small drinks. Tacos were pretty good. Crunch and flavorful. The tlacoyos were a good size and tasty. Crispy and filling.

There's more beer outside and inside is only bottles/cans. Even still, some of the cans/bottles are top notch.You can order food to stay or to go.The taco prices:-2 tacos for $8-3 tacos for $11-4 tacos for $13I went with three - the chicken tinga, chorizo/potato, and the grilled fish.Of the three, the tinga and chorizo were my faves. But go for the grilled fish if you want something a tiny bit healthier.My one complaint is the tortillas they make. They're single wrapped, thick, and dry, so they fall apart when you fold them. All three of my tacos broke in half both lengthwise and widthwise. If you're taking the food to go, probably best not to try to eat them while walking (which is, in my opinion, the best way to eat tacos). If they fix that problem, they'd be 5 stars."
858,c6aQNxYlU1IeRrgSIZj6iw,6/27/2017,4 star rating,"On my way out of Brooklyn Boulders, I couldn't help but notice that there was a new addition to the street, inviting me like a siren with its song of an open urban space. Porklife I thought the neon sign said, thinking it was BBQ, and when I got closer, I saw that it was instead Parklife, a place for Mexican food and drinks. Luckily, I didn't care for this substitution error.The space is super cute, a lot of outdoor seating with bench and table seating, all zen with rocks and greenery. There's a converted shipping container (of course) that looked to be more for beer. Inside, there was a bar area for proper cocktails and the kitchen where you could order tacos, burritos, nachos etc.I opted to try two tacos (2 for $7) - Shrimp, and Chorizo. As well, I couldn't help but order the nacho fries ($13). The tacos were pretty good, but the salsa bar (3 salsas) could've used more heat and variety.The nacho fries were the highlight, although pricey is a huge portion to share. I'd say two people could eat JUST that. So I'd share with more if wanting to get other things. This is probably the closest I could get to having San Diego style carne asada fries but with customization. The nacho fries by default come with cheese, cotija, crema, guac, beans, pickled jalapeño. I didn't care for the beans or pickled jalapeño, so I'd take those out and add carne asada on top next time.The cocktails here were great, although pricey for the portion ($11-13 in a small plastic cup). I had the ""It Was All A Dream"" (Rum, Passionfruit Condensed Milk, OJ, Amaro, Allspice, Mint) which was basically a creamy hurricane, so I loved it.I can def see myself coming and chilling on lazy days and after BKB workouts, but not as often or for as long because of the pricing unless they start to do some happy hour or other specials."

We passed it like 2 times. Tacos on point. Get the chorizo. And I will second all reviews of the steak with french fries taco situation.

I dragged my poor boyfriend along with me and thought that it was a fun couples activity. There are four people to a table and 3 tables. Each table makes 36 cupcakes in EITHER vanilla (+ vanilla and raspberry frosting), chocolate (2 chocolate frostings) or banana (cream cheese and cinnamon cream cheese frosting). Then you get 2 of each flavor of cupcake and can decorate them with whatever toppings you choose so the table you stand at doesn't affect what flavors you get.Pros(+) BYOB: There is a 15 min gap where the cupcakes are baking and you are waiting which is a good time to drink some wine(+) Relatively cheap and cute couples activity: My boyfriend can't tell a lime from an avocado and the cupcakes were fine, so no prior cooking or baking experience needed. Cupcakes are probably one of the easiest things to bake on the spectrum of baked goods so this is a good intro class(+) Bring home 9 cupcakes each :)Cons(-) The space is fairly small considering it's in Manhattan and we were also sharing the table with 2 other people. I would have preferred having a whole station to ourselves(-) Personal preference, but I am quite picky and only like vanilla cupcakes so would have wanted to choose what flavors we got instead of getting 3 of each flavor"

Life is so sweet and it can only get better right.Had no idea how popular these classes were. There were a bunch of ladies who were celebrating a bridal shower. These classes are practically for anyone who is willing to listen to directions and interested in baking. So here is the scoop on these classes.You will learn to make three types of cupcakes and corresponding frosting. All the cupcake mix as well as the ingredients are all set up for you. All you have to do is just mix it with the kitchen aid. The instructor sets you up and give you step by step direction as well as load the cupcakes in the convection oven. There is a 20 minutes break. Once cupcakes are done you make the frosting with the prepared ingredients.You get 6 cupcakes with frosting to take home with you. Had a rough time making their signature frosting topping. Okay so a smear here and there which is okay cause I am going to devour the cupcakes once I am home alone with a nice cup of coffee.When I saw the recipe for the mix as well as the frosting. I almost had a heart attack.What they say the tasty, yummy, good stuff is really bad for your health, but you only live once  as they say so enjoy with moderation. I ate all four and gave two away. Look out for Groupon and Living Social for discounts to these classes. These are group run class and group participation. This is fun for anyone who is interested in baking cupcakes."

I was going to skip it based on my first bad experience but all I kept thinking about is how my friend Pete told me about their new breakfast burrito and that's all I could think about. I went in, there were 2 other people in line, whom both looked annoyed. All I had was a Fifty dollar bill and he said he couldn't change it . ""It's early in the day, ask your manager"" I said. The woman manager came out and gave me a snarl of death. She looked my bill up and down to make sure it was ligament which was kind of offensive but whatever. She gave me back my change and I'm quite certain that her way of punishing me for making her make change was when she gave me my change, which included 50 cents, she gave it to me in all nickles and dimes. ""Seriously?"" I said. She didn't say anything and walked back into her troll layer where she belongs. She was very ugly so I'm sure when she can she likes to abuse her power because it makes her feel better for being so ugly. The guy behind the register was nice. He seemed a little confused but he was nice. I l liked him. As for the food, I had a disgusting chewy thing in my Burrito.I will NOT be going back to this Taco Bell again as I think they should either fire the current manager and replace her with someone that is actually capable of doing her easy job."
871,5ieIH2GbKCweKfrm6q8Aqg,12/1/2013,3 star rating,This is a pretty unique taco bell-pizza hut express+ hybrid. It offers the regular expected menu plus an expanded pizza hut menu including full pies and even some of the specialty pies. They offer a real nice daily special of a personal pie and drink for $4. Unfortunately the taste of the food is always off. It might just be me but it doesn't taste like any other taco ball pizza hut I've been too.

The window with bagels made me clamor for one and run through traffic to get it.We bought a couple of everything bagels. Since we were getting them to have later we did want a schmear, and they were so accommodating to give us a small container just for the two bagels.  We were thankful not to have to buy a large container.Well we toasted the bagels later, applied the schmear and it was EXCEPTIONAL!  A real New York bagel.  The texture and taste was perfect. It is obvious that the way they are specially prepared makes all the difference.If in New York go out of your way to get a truly great bagel."

Soup was ok. They gave fries that tasted frozen, then heated up with a slice of processed cheese just haphazardly plopped on top of it. Ummm. No. When I asked if that was how the meal is typically prepared, the waiter replied, ""Yes. We don't pour melted cheese over them."" He then offered to melt the cheese. It was a nice gesture, but the fries were just hard with semi burnt cheese on top. Disgusting."

It was almost shocking I paid $16 for this (even when the menu outside said it was $13). I wouldn't even be writing this if they didn't also give the biggest and thickest slices of tomato with almost no salmon...wish I got anything else but the lox if they were going to give me this.

This place definitely deserves better reviews.The diner itself had like this old school ambiance, which made you feel really comfortable. They had a fee people around us that were apparently regular customers because of the way they talked to the owner and the waiters. The owner came to every table to make sure everything was ok, which to me was the cherry on top.Our waitress was Carmen, sometimes this other gentleman would come to our table to offer/serve coffee but she was our main waitress. What a friendly, polite person, she had a really nice vibe.They came to our table to pour coffee at least 5 times, I had 4 cups of coffee myself. It was very good, always hot and fresh, just how I like my coffee. :PAs per Carmen's recommendation, me and my boyfriend ordered the ""Flame Omelette"", it had bacon, ham, sausage and cheese and came with home fries and toasts. She read our faces perfectly cause she didn't go wrong! Our omelettes were made to perfection... delightful!! We both loved the selection!!!I wish to be back again in the future and try out a different plate. I saw some orders coming out and everything looked so delicious and freshly made.100% recommended!!!!!!"

There is a ton of variety to choose from on the menu- wether you're feeling like having breakfast style or dinner style, there's so much to choose from. We ordered burgers and the best part is that we were able to customize it to our liking. It's a bit overpriced, but then again... this is NYC."

Ones that start at Henry's Local, and ones that involve me drowning in a sea of self-hatred and confusion caused by either hangover or skipped alarm clocks. Imagine what my days would be if there was no Henry's Local at all.Enjoying the quietude of the early morning or late evening here is pretty special. It's a cozy space and the baristas are kind -- they're cash only and they've many times just asked folks to just pay the next time they come in. The owners are often around, too, and one of them is responsible for many of the tasty treats that line the counter. This place is fairly central to my mental health. I'd suggest you see if it can ease your instabilities, as well.Also, if you're in Red Hook, check out their sister place on Van Brunt -- the Black Flamingo."

It's coffee competes with Blue Bottle, which is a little bit of a hike from the neighborhood but gives you something to compare against. This place is great and you don't have to be a local to love it. That being said, it's out of the way if you are not. I'd give 5 stars but there are somethings that bug me despite the AMAZING coffee they pump out. First is that the staff are just not professional. An order longer than 2 items poses serious difficulty for their memories. They make coffee in the incorrect order, simple fast drinks are made before the harder ones leaving one person waiting with cold coffee (or finished) before the order is complete. This is compounded by the slowness of the staff at making the coffee in the first place. The price is pretty good for the quality of the cup. Compare against Blue Bottle. You will see."

The price was a little bit above average for Flushing, but we thought why not help a new business where we can.The cashier seemed new or was just a little slow. That wasn't the problem. But when we pointed out an obvious price discrepancy (what we were charged vs.  what's on the menu on the wall right behind him), he just shrugged it off and offered no good explanation. We let it go since it was less than dollar. He also forgot to charge us for another item, which we notified him and paid instead of just walking out with it.After we got home, we discovered that he had forgotten to put another item into our bag! Since it was an item my wife really wanted, we called and he confirmed he left it on the counter. But when my wife went back (which took us 30min driving in traffic), he told her he didn't actually charge for it, so she had to pay. My wife was under the assumption that it was charged, since he didn't mention it over the phone. She didn't bring her wallet, so the trip was all for nothing. The owner (or manager) was there standing right next to him, and she said nothing throughout the whole thing! Not a word! Fine, we we a bit pissed, but fine, we chalk it up to bad communication.Now, finally, here's the kicker. As I was eating one of the bread today, I found a small piece of broken metal, like those you use in those metal pan scrubber!!  Picture attached.NEVER GOING BACK!"

Today, I was looking for a close bakery and decided to give it a try. It was about 7:30pm and there wasn't too much left but there was lots of different flavored large toasts... I got a coconut toast, a little bag of chocolate cookies and a chocolate cupcake... and a medium passion fruit green tea. I never pass up coconut toast and I'm glad I didn't this time! I got home, cut up the toast and it was perfect - not too sweet and not too bland... Also, same experience with the chocolate cookies. I'm glad I got it because my parent's friends don't like too sweet and these were perfect. Passion Fruit green tea with tapioc was for the kids... they had no complaints so I'm guessing it was good...Only reason I minused a star was because I feel the place was a bit messy and hard to find... It's a small ""hole in the wall"" and at first I thought they only had whatever was behind the counter display (mostly cheesecake which I wasn't a fan of). I had to look around a bit more to realize the stuff on the wall was also for sale (cookies, breads, etc.)...

The $10 steak ended up being $16 per person even though we met the $10 minimum spending requirement per person. I asked what the sides are with the steak. They said you can choose either mashed potatoes or vegetables. So I chose vegetables. When the bill came, they added $3 for a side of vegetables, per person. Then they added $2.00 up-charge because the $20 in other purchases were appetizers. So, a $10 steak night turned into a $60 bill for two. And the waiter acknowledged this was a crappy thing to do. So guess what. Screw you. Never going back. Me or my friend. You want to nickel and dime your customers, go ahead. See how long you last."

The catch is you have to spend $10 on something else prior; which isn't a bad deal at all. But the bad part was no one told us that their special specials, even being $13.95 couldn't be counted towards that when we ordered. And then the owner/manager came out less than cordial and def. Don't know the concept of customer service or even to apologize when they screwed up. Because he came to us with a nonfriendly tone of voice, speaking to us like we were his employees, which is the waiter that screwed up and didn't say anything to us. Then proceeded to be a jerk about it; this was our biggest dismay as first time patrons. I mean the food just came out, we haven't ate it, and def. Could of walked out on them in good conscience since he was being such a dauche... Otherwise, the food was actually pretty good and I would of given them a four star review. However, the waiter was nice and he apologized for his error. The place isn't huge, but in the back they have a space like a restaurant that contains about 8-10 tables.And in the front of the bar there's Four small screens, two large screens.They take credit cards, and the stuffed chicken special was delicious, the sauce won me over, besides their satellite radio playing 90s throwback music.And lastly, if your ordering stuff to go...like I did...they don't separate your veggies and pickles from the fries or the bread and it's all stuffed into one plastic container so they get soggy. In fact they had my three slices of pickles right on the fries and sandwich so even the bread was grossly wet ...."

We actually both ended up ordering the good night kiss for our second round, we really enjoyed it! Love a good ginger drink. We got zucchini fries as a happy hour small plate. There were six fries and a really good dipping sauce. The fries were cold on the inside, but fried perfectly which was strange. Probably wouldn't get them again. The ambiance was okay.

But the food simply did not blow me away. It seemed like eats I could have just put together from items at Trader Joe's. (No offense to Trader Joe's, as it's got some amazing items and for the most part VERY delicious - but I'm not the greatest meal preparer, so to put a restaurant's skills on par with MINE is...eh, not impressive. Also, Trader Joe's is known for its reasonable, borderline cheap, prices, but here? $52 for a meal for two...a bit much for lunchtime, considering you could be getting lunch specials elsewhere.) The presentation was so-so for me.I'll actually go back to the beginning. We asked if they were pet-friendly, to which they responded that yes, they were (hurray!), but we would have to dine in the outdoor seating area (understandable). But...something just...smelled off in the seating area outdoors...on the more offensive side. My bf and I wondered if it could be the flowers that were hanging. However, the flowers looked fresh, not dead. Bf and I let it slide; it was bearable (mind you, I've got a weak stomach).Ordered the reuben sandwich. It was satisfactory. Something I could have put together from Trader Joe's items (the prices at Trader Joe's are incomparable - but granted, this is the city, so can't expect Thyme & Tonic to compete with their prices). And there was a good amount of Russian dressing which complemented the contents well. My bf ordered the bruschetta, which the waiter asked if he would prefer to be vegan or non-vegan (just a heads-up for anyone that would consider this meal).The service was attentive and the wait for the food was not an issue at all.

It was some sort of fake chicken imitation which was good even-though i do not now what it was actually made of.

Didn't know it was a vegan restaurant until a friend recommended it for brunch. Compared to their competitor Blossom across the street, Thyme and Tonic has a wider variety of brunch options available and a lot more seating and fun non alcoholic drinks. However, the food was mediocre compared to most. I ordered the veg bowl with vegan feta and my friend ordered the vegan lox potato latke. Both were edible, that's it. The vegan feta was not appetizing or like any other vegan feta I've had before, it resembled chunks of tofu and had 0 flavor. The rest of the bowl had no seasoning whatsoever and there is no salt or pepper available on the tables to spice things up. The vegan lox latke was just that- potato and vegan lox (carrots) and not worth $19. My strawberry lemonade was actually delicious but my friends mimosa was weak and very small. Service is extremely average. Made a reservation for 2 and the host looked completely clueless as to what I was talking about when we checked in. Definitely didn't save us a table and just threw us wherever. I didn't enjoy the host putting people directly next to us in the squeezed 2 person seats near the back when the rest of the restaurant was empty. I couldn't relax or hear my friends convo without feeling like someone was eavesdropping or hearing their convo instead. Our waitress was nice and attentive.

We were seated and given water, but after perusing the menu were not returned to to have our orders taken. After making eye contact w/ numerous servers, one finally came and we gave him our order. We were told that 'there was no more iced tea' at 11:15am. I was given the choice of hot tea or coffee and opted to stay with water. I got the Leo bowl and my friend ordered the Huevos Divorciados along with a cold pressed juice.Leo Bowl came as larger than I had envisioned. There was quinoa as the base with chunks of salmon with what appeared to be everything seasoning over it. There were also some sweetened onions and spinach to eat with the dish. Overall each element was alright, but seemed like something I could make myself. The dish was also quite salty. When another waitress stopped by, we asked if we could get an iced tea, to which she immediately responded yes and brought one over. No idea what the first waiter was talking about. Iced tea wasn't anything special - just tea with ice, but good nonetheless.My friend enjoyed her Huevos Divorciados but noted that it was definitely quite average. The cold pressed juice was ""very healthy"" as she put it.Overall bill came out to be ~$30 pp including tax and tip. Given this is pretty far up, there are many other spots in the neighborhood that have better dishes for a better price as well. If you're vegan or have heavy dietary restrictions (or only really care about the aesthetic), then I could see the draw, but otherwise wouldn't particularly recommend."

First off, the place is small, but makes good use of its space, the toilets are closest, but hey, it's New York. The vibe and staff are great. The music is awesome. One banger after another. Great classic rock played the whole time and I was signing along in my head. I felt comfortable and the place is nice and clean for what was described as a dive bar. The BURGERS...damn! So good! Basic, but cooked perfectly, well seasoned and the fries are also fantastic. This is the kind of place I wish I had back home. Seriously, this is in top three best burgers I've had in my life."

I came here a little later in the afternoon, but was still able to grab some seating in the outside seating structure. They have a very large selection of baked pastries and breads you can choose from. You order most of your baked goods at the front, but if you plan on ordering a drink or a sandwich there's another cashier at the back. I ordered the Brie & olive sandwich that was paired with a lovely sesame baguette. The bread is on the harder/chewier side, so that's definitely something to note, but the flavors of the Brie and Kalamata olive paired nicely with it. I also ordered the chocolate rugelach, which was mouth watering delicious. The pastry was soft and had just the right amount of chocolate so it wasn't over powering."

1008,vjLQONseGC5Dwv26DuOLDQ,6/23/2019,1 star rating,"Too bad zero stars isn't an option. I ordered the vegetable burrito. Apparently the ""vegetable of the day"" was pivotal de gallo aka fresh salsa. Reminds me of Bush counting catsup as a vegetable for school lunches. $16 (!) for a tortilla, undercooked rice, cheese, salsa, and a whisper of guacamole. One the side was more salsa, sour cream and catsup (?). And a salad drowned in a salty, barely edible dressing. Oh, and it took 1/2 hour to get. And it was the worst burrito I've ever had - including fast food places. My wife's carnitas torta $15 wasn't much better. Very salty reg fries instead of sweet potato as on the menu. Cheese on the torta that wasn't listed or welcome. Waste of time and money. The server was fine."

My margarita was also real strong and flavorful. Our server was friendly and the bill was what one should expect to pay in an airport."

I had just a regular toast eggs and some ham, a coffee and later when it came down to 8 am I had a couple of drinks. the food here is nothing special really, the prices are absurd as always.the only positive in my opinion here was the service, my waitress was so nice and attentive. she was super friendly and nice. I really liked the service here but that is all."

We decided to check out Revolucion. The menu prices were reasonable and when our food arrived portions plentiful. Our first stop here we were on our way to Las Vegas. The breakfast plate I ordered was delicious, on our way to Florida we decided to try them again this time for lunch. We were very satisfied just as we were for breakfast. Service is quick and  friendly. The food  has a Mexican flair and cooked to your specificity. So for now when we travel using Jetblue this will be our go to place. Check them out if you're ever near this gate. You'll enjoy it, I promise :-)"

I had the passion fruit margarita which the server described as slightly tart. It was. I loved it. The bartender followed up with me to ask if I liked it. For dinner I had the shrimp quesadilla. It was normal-sized shrimp (I was picturing tiny canned shrimp after reading the reviews). It came with pinto beans, rice, sour cream and salsa. I liked that the beans were a bit spicy. The food was very good, overall, perhaps because I went in with low expectations. I'm not sure I could say the salsa was homemade? If it's not, that's my only complaint and demerit against this place.As for the price, this is an AIRPORT restaurant in NEW YORK. It's not going to be cheap. If that's what you're looking for, you should pass. If you'd like some good food and don't care what you spend, stop here."

The bums in the store are constantly bothering people for money or asking for cups. When it rains, the roof leaks right in the middle of the store. The workers are disrespectful towards each other and to customers. A couple of days ago, a customer who didn't speak English very well was trying to speak Spanish to another worker and the cashier was just complaining about how the customer didn't speak English and how she's annoying, etc. They don't pay attention to orders, I ran in last week and ordered 2 sundaes and only got charged for one and received one. When I corrected her, she had an attitude about it. The workers are constantly joking around with each other and throwing curses out at each other.

They have kiosks near the entrance that enable you to place your order so you don't have to wait on line. An added plus is that if you place your kiosk order to stay and pay at the kiosk, your order will come to your table. I placed my order using this method, my order arrived in less than 2 minutes, via a smiling, friendly employee! Kudos McDonalds of 14th Street on a job well done!"

I didn't think they skimped on the shrimp too much. I felt good after, my tummy wasn't yelling at me for eating garbage.

I was ordering EVERYDAY but ran out of cash in the house, I wasn't going to run away....  it was extremely petty and trust me, I'm surprised the delivery guys didn't take it upon themselves to call an ambulance.... but anyway, yeah that's my beef.... but the food is always good oh except the soup cups.... the matzoh ball is so big it takes up the Whole cup.  I love them besides the minor issues.  I'm ordering now actually....

They have their breakfast staples, like the eggs, bacon, home fries and pancakes down to a precise science. The coffee is great and always fresh. The lunches are filing and tasty. We always look forward to their pickles and coleslaw when we go for lunch or dinner. I think they have the best Manhattan clam chowder, it's rich with a tomato and clam base and is filled with chunky potatoes, celery and carrots. My wife is a matzo ball soup aficionado and insists that its second to non. The matzo ball is big, soft and flavored through. The broth is made without cutting any corners and has an ample amount of shredded chicken and nice soft vegetables. We order the matzo ball soup to go and it's great reheated. Their burgers are flame grilled and have good flavor, the fries are hot and crispy and the bun has good body. My wife enjoys the spanakopita and they give a generous portion. They bake their own muffins and cookies and you can definitely tell that's the case. We always look forward to dining here."

After I got past realizing how long ago that was, I sat down and looked at the menu, which was a standard, huge diner menu - burgers, wraps, sandwiches, salads, etc. Pickles! They brought pickles, coleslaw and chick pea salad to the table. The cole slaw was meh, but the pickles were awesome, I think I had four and then I asked them to bring more, which they did and I had two more. Side note, pickles are my thing. My mom and grandma had burgers and I ordered grilled cheese with bacon, which was really good. How can you screw up grilled cheese with bacon you ask? Simple. Make it greasy and soggy with rubbery bacon. This grilled cheese with bacon was perfect, nice, crispy bread and bacon without being greasy at all. I'm assuming the burgers were good too being that both my mom and grandma finished them. The service was good, our waitress was sweet and the prices were fair. I'd definitely return when back in the neighborhood to try out their burgers."

I am going to go through the glows and grows of the experience.The glows (what I thought was good)- I thought that the food was good for the most part. I had some chocolate chip pancakes (paid extra for extra chocolate chips), a grilled cheese, eggs, a bagel, homefires, and sausage. No complaints related to the food.The grows (what needs improvements)- The order arrived incomplete. They forgot one of the 2 Snapples that was ordered and the breakfast sausage. After the order was delivered incomplete we had to call multiple times before the call was answered. When they answered they weren't very apologetic. They delivered the sausage and the Snapple but we had already finished eating.I don't think my friend would order from them again because the grows outweighed the glows. If there is a mistake I feel like you should go above and beyond to make it right and they didn't do that."

I'm sorry to say that my order from here (under the 'King of Naan' name on Uber Eats) was amongst the most disappointing Indian food experiences, and delivery experiences, I have ever had. Having waited 20 minutes after the promised delivery time, I called the restaurant only to be told the owner had already left and be promptly hung up on before I could ask if he had indeed left to deliver my order, or if he had just walked out in despair at the quality of the food. Half an hour after being hung up on, my food presently arrived. The inclusion of 2 warm cans of soda did not redeem the food for being basically cold, and the lahori chana being more grease and water than chickpea and spice. The bread was also cold and so greasy it stained my fingers. Both had an unpleasantly strong and unexpected fishy aftertaste. At least I ordered when a deal was on, but no deal could ever tempt me back. There are far better options readily available in this neighbourhood (both sit-down and street food to go).

The lady behind the counter was so overwhelmed with handling customer orders that she didn't pay attention to what my mom and I was telling her about the order. Then we were told that the delivery guy has the food and we will have to wait for him to bring it back to the store in order for us to get the food and the lady was hesitant to make us a new order of food. After about an hour the delivery driver finally came back and we paid for our food. All the lady did was give us was a free rice pudding and salad!  She could've at least gave a discount for the food for the long wait. We didn't eat till almost 11pm!  My mom said the food was okay. If it wasn't for the fact that it was late and that all the other places in the neighborhood were closed, we would've left.  Is this what I get for trying something new...smh Never going back again!

1068,BMB9m2jp7RXgrIcCEAmQJQ,5/22/2021,4 star rating,"Fay Da is an old-school Hong Kong bakery with 10 locations (fayda.com) where you'll find all the classics -- e.g., char siu bao, cocktail and pineapple buns, and wife cake more accurately yet less descriptively labeled ""roast pork,"" ""milk cream,"" and ""sweet topping"" buns; and ""melon cake"" -- in addition to more cosmopolitan offerings such as croissants, ensaymadas, tiramisu, and jiggly Japanese cheesecake, as well as originals such as the tuna bun that so many folks have posted about here. (How's that for a long opening sentence?)The store is very compact. Upon entering, you'll encounter to your left a tiny two-table eat-in section next to a counter that holds a carousel of hot pies (such as the popular beef curry puffs) and a steamy case of steamed buns. Along the back left wall is a shelf of packaged cookies and cakes, which faces the main attraction. Here, to your right, is a self-serve case of buns, sandwiches, and cakes. Take a tray and a pair of tongs to make your selections, which the ladies at the counter will ring up for you. They will also add any of the fancier patisserie items (which self serve would destroy) you'd like from an adjacent case, as well as milk tea or coffee in tiny-looking pre-Starbucks portions. The decorated cake display faces the store's right window. And voilà: that's the whole store.Customers just replace the trays and tongs when they're done, and they felt dismayingly greasy to me. There's no pretense at all about cleaning them between customers. I visited on the day all COVID restrictions were lifted, but I'd be surprised to learn there'd been any change to this process since March 2020.Despite offering delivery via Door Dash and FreshGoGo, the store appears to be still cash only, which is fine since you won't be spending much of it. There was a steady stream of customers the whole time I was there, which wasn't long, because the process is efficient!My purchases, a custard tart and a garlic bun, held up well and still tasted fresh after a long day in my bag. The custard tart only appeared wet but tasted fine if not special. The garlic bun was sweet and fluffy, just as one expects of Cantonese breads."
1069,BMB9m2jp7RXgrIcCEAmQJQ,3/15/2021,4 star rating,I absolutely adore their mango mousse cake for celebrations! My fam loves it because it's the perfect sweetness (elders like their sweets on the lighter side) and it's a perfect mousse and cake hybrid. I also appreciate that they always give a pack of plates and forks with each cake purchase (Taipan doesn't) as well as candles. Can't forget about their famous curry beef pastries! I always get one if I'm in the area because they are really that good with their flaky pastry crust and delicious strong curry flavor. They definitely don't skimp on the curry seasoning that's for sure. The egg tarts are pretty good too.Winter melon lo po pastry...why have I not tried this before? I think I might've tried a mediocre lo po beng in the past which put me off them altogether but Fayda's version is much better. I'll definitely pick this up again at Fayda. It has winter melon filling and a thin buttery pastry shell. It's also much less sweet compared to the egg tart.

It was only after watching the review from buzzfeed that I decided to come back here and try some of their baked offerings that I decided that I had a more favorable opinion of this place than I had originally formulated.On your first trip here, skip the breads and move straight to the baked goods box which is heated by a lamp. In particular, make sure you try the baked curry puff and the bbq pork puff. Both are extremely good, very flakey (in a good way), and super affordable. I think that the bbq pork puff can run a little on the dry side, so you might want to couple this with a soy milk (which I don't recall seeing in the store during my visit). Still, these are some very good options. You can start with these options first then work your way to some of the other breads here. I like the tuna bread in particular, but I think the egg tarts and things like that are just about the same here as they are in other places. They have a cash only policy (this could vary depending on which branch you go to), but since this is a cash only neighborhood and not a restaurant, it can be forgiven."

The price was around $9-$10. Today at around 1:30 I came in for lunch again and the staff again were very nice. I got a soup (tomato and feta) for around $6-$7 and as I paid for my food, the cashier informed me that my soup came with a free bread (which was located under the soup area.)

1116,ZrHG1_Owb87mSmTU63kTPg,12/5/2018,4 star rating,"Gotham is my favorite pizza place to go when I'm craving a slice. Their pizzas are very unique though it may be a little oily. They make a thin crust, which I'm a fan of, and on the crust they add what I think is cornmeal to give it a nice crispy texture. They also give a very generous amount of toppings. I've tried other pizzas and they all taste very similar, nothing out of the ordinary. So even if I pass by so many pizza places, I will still only go back to Gotham!There are good and bad points but overall I really enjoy coming here. The staff here changes very frequently even though all of them are very friendly. Since their grand opening, I've never seen a staff more than 3 times. Because of this change, the quality is never exactly same even though the recipe is the same. The price did go up and the portion is smaller than I remembered. Despite these small nuisances I will still continue to come back here!"

Honestly, I didn't think it was that good at first but the slice grew on me. The cornmeal crust definitely threw me off a little but it was crispy and not too tough. And the cheese pullllllllllls so good so cool so much better than supermarket pizza. Dominos etc. have their place in my heart but this was a solid slice."

I like thinner, less doughy slices but this was kind of ridiculous. So i order a slice and a Diet Coke and the guy at the front says to order two slices and i get the drink for free. Fine give me that. I asked where the bathroom is and he tells me we have none. I'm looking at him and the 5 other guys behind the counter as he's putting in my slices and I said where do you all go? He says, ""We have no bathroom for customers"". I turned around and left. Anyone treating customers like that in any business deserves the same treatment. They don't care, so neither do I."

Be prepared to overpay for an OK slice, and count yourself lucky if the cashier doesn't steal from you. Considering I live a block away, they screwed themselves out of hundreds of dollars over the course of a year, I will gladly walk further for better customer service."

So the disappointment was palpable when we got there and it was closed. We needed to fuel up before heading to the High Line at sunset, and nothing drowns disappointment and sexual frustration quite like a slice of New York pizza. We decided on Gotham because it was convenient, I was a little nervous as I walked inside a tiny generic-looking spot. I had no idea it would be so good.We decided to share a simple margherita pizza and it was absolutely bomb. The 'cheese-to-sauce' ratio was perfect and we quickly forgot about our abysmal 'Pornhub-popup-store-to-SoHo' ratio. The crust had a sort of sweetness and it was soft and delicious. The pizza gave us enough energy to take on the High Line and if I'm in the area I am confident I will be back."

There was 5 people total in this bar as I was trying to order a drink. There was no one behind the bar for a good 15mins. I stood there and patiently waited for someone to tend the bar. A woman came over and i ordered a few drinks and gave her a tip. I then proceeded to order at least 5 more drinks throughout the evening and left tips each time. I then asked for a few waters later in the night and she mocked me to my face and said she was annoyed that she had to pour me waters. LITERALLY said this to my face in the most angry way! I was shocked. She then proceeded to make fun of me with her friend sitting at the bar. She was truly a genuine PIECE OF SHIT. Have fun working at this shit hole lady! Byyyyyeeeeee

There  is something very rich about this burger but not overwhelming..devoured completely... I originally came for the Iberico burger but it's currently not being offered.

I missed the garlic fries, the onion rings, and all the sauces. I missed having a reliable delivery burger that was actually cooked properly. I missed you, Black Iron. So now I'm once again ordering Black Iron burgers, just like it was 2008. Except now, instead of ordering a burger in so I could quickly stuff my face at 7:30 pm on a Friday before going out and taking shots of whiskey until 4 am and possibly vomiting said burger up onto the streets of Ave B,* I'm now ordering a burger in so I can quickly stuff my face at 7:30 pm on a Friday before...falling asleep on the couch while holding a baby/watching some Viking show on Netflix.Basically the same. _____________*This isn't something I actually did if it's something you frown upon."

I think this is important to note because when it is close to closing time, restaurants sometimes don't serve fresh food. When we received our food EVERYTHING was hot and tasted fresh. We had the BIB and the patty melt; to sum it up GET THE BIB. It is so tasty. I tried to add avocados to my burger and ended up taking it off because it ruined the taste of the burger. The burger does not need anything subtracted or added. Our food came quickly and our server gave great suggestions. We ordered the chimichurri fries and she suggested getting the spicy mayo on the side and we were so glad that we did. Please take note that their happy happy on the weekday is available during the whole time they are open. My only negative is that I did not enjoy my Moscow Mule; it had too much lime in it for me and not enough ginger.Overall I would definitely come back to this establishment."

Service was fast and very polite. They don't rush you but they are pretty efficient with staying ahead of it. We got waters as soon as we're were seated and got the check as soon as we were finished but we never felt rushed. Great diner and I will definitely be back to try the burgers."

After ordering our food my husband was eating his grilled cheese sandwich and noticed a long piece of hair sliding out his mouth coming from the grilled cheese sandwich. I quickly made the waiter aware of the problems . Immediately after, he shouted at me that i'm a liar and nasty because I placed the hair inside of my own sandwich. I was confused as to why I would do such a thing and asked if i could could get it removed from my bill. He continued to speak very disrespectful to me and my husband and was unclear of why he was doing such. I have been coming to this diner for about 10 years now  and never have I known them to be this way. I was shocked at the lack of respect and customer service I received during my visit."

Not the worse but to me they could be better. I would say my favorite meal there is the cornbread sandwich they serve. It's a real hearty portion and worth the price.Most of the food and drinks in the diner are reasonably priced especially the seafood dishes. The service is good, the staff is friendly. It is definitely an old school vibe in there and there are tons of regulars. If you're looking for a quick last minute real meal, I would definitely got here first!"

The owner completely belittled me and my friends and ate off of my friends plate when we politely asked for a new meal since there was something off about the meat. After eating the food OFF OF HER PLATE he placed it back in front of her and said that it tasted good and that we were lying. He refused to take it off of the bill even though he ate off of her plate which is health and safety issue considering it is a pandemic. He continued to yell at us from the street while we waited for a taxi and made us feel extremely unsafe. He was completely out of line when we were being polite. Will never be coming back here and I don't recommend anyone else to ever come back their either unless you want subpar food and rude service.

I showed up a little late to breakfast this morning but the server was quick to furnish a coffee and take my order right away. The food came out pretty fast (less than 10 mins) so the turnaround time is nice and efficient. Eggs were runny and over easy the way it's supposed to be. Not sure why the eggs were on TOP of the corned beef hash though....I have uneasy feelings of mixing yolk with beef and had to finesse the egg around the best way I can. The potatoes were good- standard stuff. Diner coffee 100% made me a little more ready to start my day though Overall, standard breakfast for a standard day."

1159,DYzpeSntTyL7ARvX3vSp6A,8/17/2022,5 star rating,"This is a new Szechuan place that has opened on Northern Boulevard right in between Bayside and Flushing. There really is no other restaurant quite like it as the interior decor is really beautiful and the food is delicious. First, let me start by saying if you do not like eating spicy and you do not like eating anything with peppercorn in it, this place is NOT the place for you. Almost every dish has one or the other in it (unless you're ordering the fish or veggies). At first glance, you'll notice a swarm of people outside. This place is new and it is good so it is busy. Make sure to call ahead for a reservation (not guaranteed) or be prepared to put your name down and wait for your spot. Luckily, this place is right on Northern so there's many stores around for you to kill some time :) The interior is very beautifully designed and you can tell that they put a lot of thought and heart into it. This is a beautiful place to take your grandparents and parents for a family styled meal. There are a few private tables upstairs if you wanted to do something a bit more private for your meal. Unfortunately we did this family style so a lot of the dishes I don't know the names of (I know very helpful) but I will list and describe some of my favorites for the night! Must-Order Food: -I loved the pork belly wrapped cucumbers-The fried black sesame ball with sour bean curd was a strange combination when I first heard of it but absolutely delicious when I bit into it. It was very reminiscent of the TaiPan Bakery Sesame Balls but fluffier, crunchier, and less chewy-The Clay Pot Fried Rice is a must order! -Order the seafood here (the crab and shrimp are very good) - I would choose the ones that are less fried if you wanted more of the authentic seafood taste. Be mindful of the variety of dishes you are ordering - if I were to come back again, I would scale back on the fried foods but order more of the non-fried seafoods. Overall, if you're in the area and like spicy foods, definitely check this place out!Food: 5/5Price: 4/5Ambience: 5/5"

1162,DYzpeSntTyL7ARvX3vSp6A,7/25/2022,4 star rating,"Try to come early if you can. Got to put your info on the tablet if you wanted to be seated accordingly. This was one of the new spots that we saw the other day. Decided to try it out. They do have valet parking. But, parking on the streets isn't too bad to find. If you are a spicy eater. This spot will definitely get you there. For a person who doesn't eat a lot of hot foods. I come to appreciate this spot. They have all levels of hotness. So definitely someone who doesn't handle spice too well can definitely come.I can't say much of the selections I've ordered since I have no knowledge of the name of any of the dishes I had. I was lucky to have good company that knew what to eat! The sour fish was definitely good! It sounds weird. But, it had that perfect blend of flavors and the fish was so silky smooth. Watch out for bones! The pork belly was a bit on the saltier side but still goes well with  white rice. The cabbage was surprisingly addicting. It just looks boring to the eye. But what I'm assuming they stir fried it with porkbelly goodness just makes it mMmmm..The pig's tongue was on the spicier side! be warned. At first, it doesn't hit ya. But in time it brings the sweats! Will definitely come back to try other things! I only knocked a star cause I told the waiter we can wrap our to go box ourselves...but he insisting in helping and spilled most of it on the table instead.. Was funny..but was not funny at the same time."
1163,DYzpeSntTyL7ARvX3vSp6A,8/30/2022,4 star rating,"Kind of hard to first gauge this place because it is an Asian restaurant with minimal views... but I was curious because of Szechuan cuisine and driving pass this place. Coming into the restaurant, the decor is nice, but it seems to be very busy and hectic in here. I have been waiting for almost 20 min plus to place my order in, which that to me is a bit long... and I had to get the waiters attention twice to do my order. Decor is really nice overall. Be careful when reading menu price since it's in Chinese. So the red symbol with price is if you have a membership for the restaurant and the black symbol with price is the regular price. So just be mindful for the food you order and price you are willing to spend. The food is on the pricier end. The pork belly is really tender, and had a good balance of flavor and saltiness to it. The spicy beef wasn't the best but wasn't the worst. The beef could have been more tender. The eggplant was delicious and really helped balanced the spiciness of the meal.Overall there wasn't anything alarming about the food I would give a low rating. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because of the service taking way too long and that the food is a bit overpriced for the quality that was served. I still would try again with a group of friends. But just be warned with the spiciness and the price you are going to pay."

Fourteen draft beers.  I will post a pic.  High energy classic rock playing.  Rear room with skeeball and some kind of shooting game.I liked the sign for a ""Family Feast"" - a pitcher of beer and four shots.And they give a free personal pizza with any drink.  Bartender gives you a single ticket which you take to the kitchen window which is opposite the bar.  Extra toppings are $1.00 each - pay the bartender for a different ticket.  Cook rings a bell as your pizza is ready - no servers. Excellent crispy thin crust pie.  I was impressed. They only do pizza - no burgers, no salads.One of the best bars on Bedford.Place is old and a little divey.

Who wouldn't go to this bar?It's a dive bar, very dark and dainty-- Honestly I walk past it every time I'm on my way to the gym  (5:15AM) and I think to myself... Ewww that place looks very dirty-- who would hang out at a place like this? Wow is that throw-up? And then I realize oh crap.. Me.. It's Me I would totally hang out at this establishment and I do.. Probably 4 times a month if I count correctly. Of course that's a min of 4 times a month. They have Happy Hour everyday-- That means Saturday and Sunday too!! The holy grail. It's $1 of the beers and drinks. The best deal is $5 for a shot and a beer... Who needs a chaser when you have beer? (this is how you know you're going to be waking up wasted) But have no fear.. The $1 or free pizza is here! Yes you read that correctly.. It's a $1 for your own personal pizza. with every drink from 8PM to like 3AM. In my mind I was thinking holy crap how do they make there business here? Every drink you get a pizza-- they have no profit (my business class came in handy) and they I realized.. Well how many pizza's can one person eat? That's right Angelica.. Logic.. You probably will not eat more then 2 pizzas. You also have the options of toppings for and extra $1. The Free pizza is from 12Pm-8PM. They have an indoor and outdoor(front) area-- love the outdoor tables.. they actually have holes for your drinks so they don't fall.. They can't have you wasting alcohol.Very load but in a fun way, they have a jukebox. Favorite part: Everyone comes here!! You will see all walks of life at this bar and you don't feel any different. Here it doesn't matter who you are what you do.. Here you are just out to have a great time.. and that is the best part! Can't wait to go back-- This review got me excited."

I went to ask the lady behind the counter (says Luciano on my receipt which she was hesitant to hand back to me after the incident) what the muffin flavor was and pointed to it and she did respond. Ok, I understood that she was putting change in the register so I waited. She then replied back shortly after ""yes""? Okay- normal communication in a busy bakery type place like this am right? Fine.I continued to tell her my order. Then I saw a banana at the counter and asked how much it was. She just continued to ring me up and not answer how much it was making me feel a slight bit uncomfortable then I asked her again and she said 75 cents ($1) for a banana is too much so I was just checking). Everything was smooth.Then she said ""$9.75"" and I was skeptical but always have trust in the server so I paid but then thought wait that's definitely not correct and quickly told her. SHE DID NOT WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT THE CHECK NOT BEING CORRECT. She tried rushing me away and on to the next customer. I looked at the check and she didn't want to see it, she kind of humiliated me on line. She wouldnt go through it with me until I was so persistent that everyone on line knew there was an issue.She wound up ringing me up for 2 iced coffees when I only ordered 1. She told her co worker next to her the issue and I chimed in saying she was being very rude. Not once did anybody say a sorry or apologize.In fact, I read the check after and she still messed it up. How is a medium red eye coffee 2.75 and a small is 3.00? It was manually inputed in the system so technically they still owe me 25 cents.They can keep there 25 cents!I really didn't even feel like eating and drinking the coffee I got because of it but I was too damn hungry!Step your customer service game up!

Recently one of their front cashiers, the older one has been extremely rude even to the point of telling me she would have to charge me extra if I asked for some milk to add to my coffee or denying me a coffee sleeve for my iced coffee (because of condensation and napkins not holding up). The managers are of no help and to be honest, with so many cafes and bakeries in this area, why would I go spend my hard earned money at this place where there is absolutely no real customer service.

Just the side of homemade potatoes (( I wanted 2 sunny side up eggs with ham and a side of multigrain toast and I got a ham and egg sandwich. No, I didn't order a sandwich.. It wasn't even a good sandwich. My Cobb salad was overdressed and soggy and I couldn't eat it. It was supposed to be the healthy part of my meal and it was the inedible part. Don't put dressing on a salad that's ordered for delivery !! Put it on the side people. It gets soggy by the time it gets to the destination. I also skipped the chicken, but I was charged the same price. Unfair. The smoothie had huge chunks of ice in it and I had to put it again in the blender and finish mixing it. I ended up cooking my own eggs and eating them with the side of potatoes that were decent. Not worth.One star for food, extra star for the delivery guy who brought the food fast, but he won't have to make the trip to my house again. Don't wanna try any other food from this place."

Every time I order something ex:grilled chicken in a wrap with onions and or bacon or anything inside the wrap besides chicken there is BIG UP CHARGE. I asked for Bacon today in my grilled chicken wrap  the staff informed me and said new year new prices. It is now $.300 to add bacon instead of .75 cents. I wouldn't mind paying for the wrap with bacon but it's tiny the wrap and usually I can't even taste the little bit of bacon they put in the wrap and feel I am eating lettuce and they wanted .75 cents extra for onions. I mean how are onion an extra .75cents and $3.00 for bacon?  I would not mind paying a little extra but the food is not that good and NOT LAVISH NOT HIGH QUALITY AT ALL to be charging extra for little things like .75 cents for onions and $3.00 to add low quality bacon to a small wrap with mostly lettuce. Every time I order bacon in my wrap they give me so little and the wrap is mostly lettuce. They have some nerve UP CHARGING when they sparingly give you what you ordered.  The owners are taking advantage of the community and up charging because they feel they can get away with it. This will be my last time here, going to the corner store I can get the same meal for $5.00."

You can get a bucket of ice cold beer for under $15.   They bring you a basket of hot butter toasted bread while your meal is being prepared. Always order the lunch size meal, because it's the smaller portion and it will be enough- seriously! All the wait staff are lovely."

1204,g7pAeomzeIQY4mCfpOyHUQ,7/5/2017,4 star rating,"Went to City Island on July 2nd, right before the holidays and BOY was it a traffic nightmare.  Luckily, we found Portofino on Yelp.  It was the perfect escape from the millions of cars piled up on that one lane main street on the island.Portofino has an amazing outdoor deck overlooking a small marina.  It was beautiful watching the sunset and the clouds change from white to pink as we had our dinner, and frankly why I'm giving this place a 4 star rating.Food was a bit pricier than some of the other places on the island, but you are comparing Coney Island grab and go food vs a sit down meal on a deck.  Very different.  Seeing how long the lines were at other joints, I was thrilled to find Portofino. Entrees are pretty large. We ordered 2 entrees and a dozen oysters for 3 people, because we weren't too hungry. I think 2 entrees and 2 appetizers would have been perfect.We had the Branzino whole fish and really enjoyed it.  My family loves fish, but most restaurants overcook it. Portofino actually cooked it well! Bravo!We also ordered the Lobster Tail and Shrimp Scampi Linguine - Lobster Tail was very small, but actually very good.  Overall, I was very happy with our choice to find a comfortable restaurant that had a nice view.  My parents liked it a lot!"
1205,g7pAeomzeIQY4mCfpOyHUQ,9/1/2014,4 star rating,One of the best restaurants on the island. I really love it here. If only I was able to come here often. The service is great and the food is just yummy!!! This is my number 1 recommendation when I tell people about City Island.

The fish of the day Dover fish was cleaned and filleted at the table. The Blackstone wine was very tasty too. Probably my new favorite American wine.
1208,g7pAeomzeIQY4mCfpOyHUQ,3/17/2014,3 star rating,"This is my first groupon experience on the restaurant deal, so I don't know if this is normal or it's odd that customers who bought the groupon still have to pay the tax,I thought it should be included in the groupon value. I am surprised that the billed came out and saw I have to pay the tax ( and the tax was based on the original food & wine price) and the tax is significant. On our bill they charged us $14 on the tax, so basically you have to expect to pay about $40 - $45 extra ( including tips & tax ) for a party of 2 people.  The food is not bad but not outstanding, the steak is especially disapointing, it's not Filet Mignon. Of course it doesn't have to be a filet mignon to make a good steak, but the one I had that day is just not good.  The highlight of the day is definitely the lobster tail,  I almost stole all of the lobster tail from my husband's plate, it is delicious!  The service is good, too, there are several waiters taking care of our table that day and they are all very polite and attentive. Overall, I think I paid FAIR price for the dinner, but I don't feel like I really got a great deal."

I ordered a cocktail and it tasted like fruit punch, ordered a mozzarella and tomato salad, which had no seasoning and unripe tomatoes. The mixed greens on the mozzarella were wilted. I ordered the crab cakes, it wasn't even crab. It was ORANGE, 3 hours later I still don't even know what the meat was because it didn't even taste like imitation crab. Unfortunately, the so called ""crab"" was in two other entrees I ordered; lobster and shrimp. Ruined everyone's meal. The mashed potatoes weren't even fresh, they were instant. The broccoli was large, it had the entire stem on it. Wasted $300 on the meal, and it was terrible. The best thing was the free bread they gave at the beginning of the meal. Don't waste your money and time."

The ramen tasted good, but was pricier than other places. I had the Ton Toro pork ramen and paid $2 more for the eggs, which were cooked the way I like them -- soft boiled. The broth was rich and flavorful and I like the soft and chewy texture of the wavy noodles. As someone who likes spicy foods, I really liked the option to add chili oil to the ramen. The chili oil was pretty good. It tasted especially good in the chili oil mayo sauce that came with the truffle fries."
1215,XeuqZ63RUJCShLT8GK2KOg,12/28/2022,4 star rating,"It's not best or anything... but Nakamura has a spot in all of us New York Ramen goers. It's not the best or the most traditional. But it's like what you'd get in Japan if you got inside a ramen shop with some different style. Ramen is diverse and if you're not following the 3 Standards (Shoyu, Shio, Miso) then you serve other styles like tonkotsu or unique things like Nakamura's karaage (deep fried) chicken in the bowl. Is this the dream balance of ramen? Perhaps not. But it is a Way. The Way of Ramen is deep and diverse. Nakamura is an establishment which many of us follow to see where their path may lead. Because pulling off a good bowl of ramen is hard. Especially when you are trying to be unique. Service is standard. Polite and kind. Ambiance is great if you like Japanese small eateries. There's only few tables. Tiny."

That said, you can always get more by ordering the sizzling terriyaki chashu. It looked and smelled great. A few tables ordered it. I was not happy with the service. My friend made a reservation and I got here earlier and was told to wait at the bar even though another woman was allowed to sit at a table and wait for her friend. I pointed this out and he didn't even listen. Then he said, ""if you want to cancel the reservation you can cancel it."" He finally gave me a table, but it felt awful to be treated differently and so rudely."

1220,XeuqZ63RUJCShLT8GK2KOg,6/4/2021,4 star rating,"Solid ramen on the smaller portion size. You get all the ramens you expect, from shoyu to tonkatsu and some creamier soup bases.The noodles are thin, but they are definitely lacking quantity...does not fill up the average dude. Also, a lot of toppings you'd normally get at a ramen restaurant, like the soft boiled egg, seaweed, and fake crab meat, are not given for free, which is a bummer because you essentially just have ramen soup with noodles and some small veggies.The chicken wings are really small -- I've never seen a restaurant cut the flat wings in half and serve them like that. The flavor is decent though.tldr food tastes good but would want bigger portions."

We had to wait about 30 minutes.Nakamura has a small menu, but the food is excellent. The Yuzu Wings were crispy and cut into half pieces. Had a really nice yuzu flavor. A can of Japanese Orion Beer costed $6.My favorite ramen was the classic Tontoro Ramen with pork broth and the chewy noodles. If you like truffle flavor, the Truffle Miso Ramen was very satisfying. Other ramens we tried were Yuzu Dashi and Torigara. All were very good.Attentive and friendly service. Would definitely come back and place a reservation online."

In the evenings, esp. on weekends, it is packed.  The food is excellent and service as well.  I also had lunch one summer in 2021 with parents and was a good experience and good price deal.  I just got the green curry last night which was great but the medium spice was pretty spicy. One inconvenience is with ordering, you have to order online at certain times via their website, so you can't order by phone. It's a hidden gem away from the madness of Bell Boulevard."
1226,7pdmdB6PohUO9AchXAgTBQ,4/4/2022,4 star rating,"great local thai spot. We live super close by and can't believe it took so long to try it out especially since my husband is a big fan of Thai cuisine. Came on a friday evening and the main dining room was packed. The back patio was not open but it didn't look like it needed to be. Service was good and food came out in a good pace. to eat we had:Ribs with sticky rice: we had this as an appetizer. very tasty and ribs are super tender. it's a little on the sweet side but it goes really well with the sticky rice. Pad kee Mao with pork: good flavors, just the right amount of heat. Tom Ka Gai: soup was delicious. it's creamy but light and acidic at the same time. BKNY mixed special: with shrimp, mussel, squid, scallop, and veggies in a peppercorn sauce. I had this prepped mild and it was awesome. she gave me the chili sauce on the side so I can adjust the heat myself. the seafood was all cooked perfectly and the portion was just right. delish!overall a pretty decent Thai restaurant! will be back to try more items next time!"
1227,7pdmdB6PohUO9AchXAgTBQ,10/5/2021,5 star rating,Okay so ya'll. I am not the biggest fan of Thai food only due to have an underwhelming experience at a different restaurant years ago. But this restaurant is so good! Came here with my homegirl for a quick bite and drinks and everything was great. We sat in what is considered the outdoor section though it is covered. Our waitress was also very sweet and attentive throughout our entire stay.My homegirl and I both ordered the lychee martini which was really good. The calamari was great and we ordered the crab meat fried rice and chicken and shrimp pad thai. 10/10. This is coming from someone who always hated pad thai.Would recommend this place and try other things. Hopefully my future experiences won't change this 5 star review.

The orders were ready as promised when we got there.We dined in before and also ordered take out here before, but in my opinion the food is never outstanding, but average. I definitely had better drunken noodles and Pad See Ew before, and food is pricey here too. The beef in both dishes were a bit tough and there could have been more flavoring in the dishes. But we still come back once in a while because we live in the neighborhood and we love our Thai food.Ambiance: niceFood: okay"
1231,7pdmdB6PohUO9AchXAgTBQ,1/5/2022,4 star rating,"I heard of this restaurant for awhile but was never in the the area during meal time.   I made a trip here just try check it out after ordering pickup. Without GPS I will probably miss it.  There is a small parking lot in the back, which was full on a weekday lunch hour.  Entrace from parking lot is the back of restaurant where you pass through the tented outside/extended dinning area.   There is good number of seating inside and outside, so if you dine-in there shouldn't be a wait.   The décor is kind of non-Thai style, looks more like a bar/restaurant than what I expecting a Thai cuisine would be decorated. I ordered the regular menu, not the lunch menu was expecting this will get more food for paying extra.  Well, even for me, weight under 145lb need to eat two order.   Taste is not above average if not for the price I would give it 5 stars.  Even when I ask for highest spicy level it's not that spicy so it's good for general dinner who might not be used to Thai food.  I asked for side chili in fish sauce and that fixed it."

The drinks were great I'd highly recommend the peach sangria it'll give you a good buzz. I can't quite remember the name of the spjked Thai ice tea but you won't miss it on the menu. It's Thai iced tea with baileys and rum. Soo good. This is certainly a good spot for a date or food and drinks with friends. The service is great the waitress was very attentive"

Okay so the pho was amazing! Very flavorful and delicious. Definitely necessary after a long night out or a cold windy day. I would personally eat it any day and any occasion. We also ordered the spring rolls and the grilled beef with rice. I normally get spring rolls and this was very similar to restaurant quality and taste of other viet restaurants I've been to. I very much liked the food especially being viet myself. I normally get my viet fix at home or in Chinatown. I'm glad I gave this place in Bayside a chance. The sticky rice was also okay.

There was a reasonable amount of meat in the bowl and one serving was enough to satisfy us. I haven't found many places nearby that would sell fatty brisket Pho, so that made it for me."
1243,-YazuZbXAM_NOny8LpLQpQ,10/6/2022,3 star rating,"Pretty basic and straight forward - standard for what we see around here for Vietnamese food. It's Chinese-owned, like the majority in NY so it's never going to be as authentic as we'd like. (Does anyone know of Vietnamese food in Flushing to Long Island actually owned and operated by a Vietnamese person? Let me know please!) The restaurant is spacious enough with some additional seating out front. Service is ok - nothing special. Food is overall fine, not bad - nothing amazing. But as far as all of the Pho shops we have around - theirs is no better and certainly no worse. For us, it's just another one of the options nearby for basic Pho when we need it.

However, lately Chipotle has been offering a lot of deals such as free guac and chips, and BOGO Chipotle with a free Izze.I came in on a weekday, probably about half a hour before they were suppose to close. There were only two people working at the time, and no line. The lady moving me along the line was very unattentive.. I said brown rice and she put in white rice, then when I repeated myself she poured out the white rice and then scooped up some brown rice for me. I said no beans, but she was getting ready to put some pinto beans in my bowl. There was no issue with the protein.. and somewhere along the line, before finishing up my bowl.. she capped it! But, she quickly fixed her mistake by saying that she's sorry. We moved along the line fine at this point. At the register, I showed my coupon and the girl working the register had no idea what this coupon was. She asked the girl working the line, so I could only assume that the one working the line was the manager. They had no idea what this coupon was.. even after I had explained it to them, but finally we got it right and I walked out with two bowls and an Izze after only paying for one bowl.The food is how I remember Chipotle to be, the chicken was tender and not bitterly burnt.. The food was truly excellent and up to Chipotle standards. I definitely enjoyed that. However, the service and attention to customer could be improved."

First let me start off by saying that if I wasn't starving and about to pass out, I wouldn't eat at the food court at queens center mall. Not that there is anything really wrong with that , I'm  just not a fan of eating in food courts (this one isnt really that clean and seating is scarce).So the only thing that I thought was sensible and gluten free friendly other than a salad was chipotle. I wanted to be full and satisfied but boy was I so disappointed. I decided to order a vegetarian bowl (a lot of stuff minus meat). It looked like a sloppy mess. They gave a tiny spoon of rice, tiny spoon of beans, barely any lettuce or tomatoes. To make matters even worse when she told me it was $9 I was in total shock. I could have spent the same amount and had enough spanish or chipotle inspired food for at least three days. Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT EAT HERE.....oh and the area with the lemons..yuck gross gross gross (can you imagine the amount of bacteria)Anyway , there is enough food options in the neighborhood. Choose wisely"

Always smells great.  Was lucky enough to be here once while they were roasting and that was cool to watch. Generally we stick to the hot and iced coffee. Coffee here doesn't have a burnt taste to it. We also eat breakfast here sometimes. The egg sandwiches are good but I love their buttered rolls.  So soft!Edit:  Forgot to mention the staff... really nice and helpful, no complaints there."

The turkey avocado egg wrap had zero flavor, so bland I couldn't even finish it :(It seems like this is a popular place for brewed coffee and beans. D'Amico has a roaster in the back where they roast their own beans in-house. The coffee smells are deliciousloy intoxicating. I would definitely go back to try a coffee and skip the food.They do offer free wifi with a 30 minute limit."

The slicing machine had to be set on the thinnest setting to get it that thin. Even folded & overlapping, it didn't equal 1 decent size slice. When we complained, the non English speaking staff didn't understand us. Funny, they understood us when we placed the order. Second issue, the bathrooms have no sink. There is a sink around the corner from the bathrooms & is kind of hidden. I couldn't wash my hands before eating my lunch ' it was very distressing to me eating with the same hands that just....All in all, a very annoying experience.

I didn't purchase any whole beans coffee since my French press have been packed away back at my parents, but I must say as a first timer this place got the charms of being a good local spot where I can imagine regulars hanging out there all day. I came after work, and arrived half a hour before they close. I managed to get some work done, and even stayed there about 10 minutes over with no one bothering me or telling me anything.The staff is ...(thinking of the right words) most pleasing group of people that you can find in a coffee shop. They are mainly older age Italians which is adorable because even though the store got hipsterized the heart and soul of the shop still remains through the staff.I was greeted by a lady in the counter that told the other patron to wait a minute so she can serve me because I got there first. She also guided me through the condiment bar and brought out soy milk for me with no complaints. When asked what time the store closes (which is 20 minutes later),  she assure me that I can stay until the closing time. (I actually ended up staying later since there were so many locals still in the sitting area while they started cleaning up.)Overall, this place is far from home but I am definitely glad I visited."

It's not overly acidic, it's not super floral tasting like a lot of the bougie shops popping up around town... it's just great, dark, complex, coffee. And the breakfast sandwiches are pretty spot-on, too. Also, sometimes they'll give you a free small coffee with a breakfast sandwich. I mean.. what? Best deal in the city."

1274,5RCrpBnI_3UdabG1lieknA,12/7/2015,4 star rating,"Good cinnamon rolls, especially the big traditional ones. Is it just me, or is the icing different on the  big rolls versus the mini ones? The mini ones seemed too thick and cream cheesy frosting/icing, where I wanted that gooey oozey glaze. Making myself drool here thinking about it. Always somewhat of a line here, but not crazy long and it does move fast -- it's not extensive or intricate ordering here. A few seats to the side where people can sit and eat their snack, but this is a to-go sort of destination. Also, where the seating is, you can watch as the workers make fresh rolls, rolling out the dough, putting on the butter, cinnamon, rolling it yet again, and slathering on the icing. I appreciate that transparency -- no funny business or people sneezing, coughing, or picking their noses onto your food. They also sell churros too, and blended drinks. Since it gets busy (it's a great location at the mall), turnover is fresh. It's probably rare to get a dry, old, caked roll when they are constantly baking new ones to support the demand! Yeah, it's super fattening and sugary, so don't go expecting this to contribute to your health or diet regimen. This will RUIN it, but it's a worthwhile treat here and there."

I.., I......it was the hottest, most humid of days that this little earthling has ever experienced.., I needed cover from the searing sun..., I needed to give my home's AC unit a rest.., and this place (trying to avoid the 'M'-word) is only 3 blocks from my crib.., furthermore, my paycheck was burning a hole right through my pocket! I had my reasons okay!?Anyways, so I happened to be in this 'place'. As the cool conditioned air started massaging my pores, I decided to help things along.., with a smoothie.Indicative of any mall, no matter how ginormous, how swanky, ghetto, or smelly, you have options. After three rounds of meticulously sifting through pages and pages of research material (yelp), I decided to go with Cinnabon for my smoothie fix. And, after drooling over all their pretty posters, I chose their...  MEGA FRUIT CHILLATTA!!This is the prettiest smoothie on earth. I'm not exaggerating. Although, I am still suffering from a smoothie brain freeze. Regardless, I'll try in my best mentally incapacitated state to continue reviewing...They dressed this smoothie up and down with cute swirly raspberry syrup, then they hit it up with some whipped cream, and then they bitch-slapped it with some more cute swirly raspberry syrup over the top. It looked like (picture it with me now) a candy shop in a cup! My fillings started shaking when I held it in my hand.., to the point where I started wondering about co-payments.Surprisingly, I enjoyed the smoothie from beginning to end. The sweetness wasn't overpowering at all, and it was flavorful with a chilling side effect; (unlike Michael Myers, who IS overpowering, not tasteful at all, but rules when it comes to that whole chilling side effect thing).So, there I sat, in this 'place of business' shielded from the devilish heat outdoors whilst being thoroughly massaged inside and out by the AC & smoothie double team.The best $4.50 I've ever spent!Afterwards, I did some more unthinkable acts (Kohl's, TJ Maxx, Century 21). The good news is, there is no more burning hole in my pocket."

Ordered Ice coffee, apple turnover and a cream cheese and jam bagel. Since it's close by and a easy order, I decided to walk after my order has been confirmed. Upon arrival, I walked up the counter to see if my order was ready. I provided my name on the order and the worker seemed to be confused and asked to see my confirmation. I pulled out my phone and was looking for the text confirmation and saw a seamless bag placed on the counter. Here is the strangest thing has happened. I asked if this was for 'Alexander' and the other staff member looks at me and asks if I am a pick up service. I was puzzled and responded that I am not and he told me I am not not the person who ordered the food and I'm a pick up service because I was looking at my phone prior picking up the order. After the strange ordeal, I was able to go home and finally eat. I would not recommend the apple turnover for a few reasons. It was burnt on the bottom but I ate it cold, so I'm assuming when they were making this pastry they managed to burn the bottom? There was much of the apple filling and all I can taste was the pastry (this was after I peeled off the whole bunted bottom). Cream cheese and jam on the bagel was mediocre, there was a ton of cream cheese in the middle, so any cream cheese lovers out there you should definitely stop by here. Their ice coffee was very sweet, I did mess up on this one since I usually order black coffee, but I can still drink coffee with milk and sugar if given. But, they added a ton of sugar in this coffee.Overall, what I ordered wasn't appetizing and probably wouldn't go back."

In terms of the prices, they really nickel and dime you here. I paid $5.50 for an bacon egg and cheese on a roll, on average it costs $3-$3.50 in the area. The past 3 times I've called in they've forgotten to place my order, forcing me to wait almost half an hour there. What's the point of calling in then? Not only that but they ALWAYS mess up my order.

I was in the neighborhood and craving something fried - what better than this!Seeing that the portions were quite large, I opted to skip appetizers and go straight to entrees. We ordered the Berkshire Pork Curry and the Brooklyn Set. Both were very good but I definitely preferred the curry. It was nice to have a sauce to eat the rice and pork with whereas the Brooklyn Set came with just a small side of horseradish wasabi. Service-wise, things were fine. We were packed tightly into a small booth with another table right next to us (ah, NYC) so we were able to grab our server for more water, napkins, etc pretty easily, since she was also attending to the next table. Food was pretty quick and the portions were quite big, allowing us to take some home for later. For the price, no doubt, this is a good deal. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a great deal in midtown!"

When you first walk in, you'll notice the dimly-lit interior and abundant use of wood, giving the restaurant that traditional Japanese look. We were lucky to get seated at a table pretty quickly, but I recommend getting here a bit early or reserving a table (for larger parties) because it does get pretty crowded.I ordered the half & half curry (~$23) from their lunch special menu, which came with both chicken and pork katsu (cabbage salad and miso soup were also included). The katsu was hot, crispy, and surprisingly light -- It was definitely the star of the dish!! They also have this homemade katsu sauce that's to die for. It's tangy and a bit bitter so pairing it with the fatty, juicy katsu makes for the perfect balance. The curry was good too but it was sweeter and thicker than I thought it would be.If you're looking for good katsu at a reasonable price, I recommend giving Katsu-Hama a try.

There was only two other customers in there so I can't speak to service or food during rush hours. It's so quiet and intimate inside it was an awesome place to stumble upon after a day at MoMa.

It feels traditional, homey, and comfortable.The pork cutlet (dipped in panko and deep fried) is juicy and a great, personal size. The bento also comes with miso soup, a 3-set salad, pickles and sashimi set. You also get a bowl of rice and a hot tea to finish.

If your group is larger than 4 people, I'd suggest making reservations to make sure they have enough space.It's dimly lit in some parts of the restaurant so my pictures aren't that great. The lighting seems to be brighter in the back and the seats near the kitchen. I got a teishoku set that came with 2 chicken katsu and 2 fried oysters. It came with tartar sauce for dipping. I realized that I'm not as big of a fan of oysters as I had thought so I'd probably stick to their pork and chicken katsu if I ever revisit. They provided sesame seeds in a mortar which we're supposed to grind with a pestle then mix with the tonkotsu sauce. It's unique for sure, not sure how much of a difference it made for the sauce though. The chicken katsu were perfectly crispy. Sides of miso soup, rice and cabbage salad were pretty good too. Altogether it made for a very filling meal before the show.Bathrooms were small but clean and well stocked."

Berkshire pork loin was a tougher cut than we expected, and the batter was a bit heavier than expected. Curry flavor was okay, nothing special. Pork loin cutlet don was a little too wet for my liking, and there were noticeable chunks of fat in the pork cut (if that's what you're looking for). Also surprisingly tough, but flavor wise it was ok. Okononiyaki was quite interesting, fried more than usual, and had a more omelette texture, and a ton of kewpie. Wait is expected even for a weekday dinner- interior decor reminded me of what I'd see in Japan."

He said it wasn't written on the paper...that's not my mistake as the customer. Then he proceeds to tell me that me waiting behind the glass is rude. I should've just asked for my money back then.Don't waste your time coming here to receive terrible service and mediocre coffee. It's just a matter of time before this place closes shop anyways.

They made it seem like I was lying and had an attitude about it and refuse to give me my order. All of a sudden my money appeared and they laughed.

Barry always greets you with a smile, a Guinness and a genuine interest in how you're doing. I threw my boyfriend a surprise party here, and Barry let us decorate the whole place. Not only that, but he helped us cut the cake and was super generous the entire evening - turning off the lights when we sang happy birthday, taking pictures of the group, and generally just being incredibly hospitable the whole evening. This bar truly is a gem on the UES and I highly recommend it for any occasion, whether it be a quick beer or a 30th birthday party :)."

Never seems too crowded on the times I have dropped in here for a pint of Guinness, but the bartenders are friendly and the place is welcoming. A nice change from the normal fratty or sports bars in the area. It is a small pub with only a booth and about a dozen bar stools. Seems like the kind of place where everyone knows each others names. Kind of like a mini Cheers kind of place. If you are a fan of cream ales and stouts this is a good spot to relax and enjoy your drink. Accompany it with a shot of  Jameson's and you have a proper Irish drinking experience. The do have a happy hour, good jukebox, and on occasion will have live music playing. Just a nice little neighborhood spot to relax and enjoy a drink among a more adult crowd."

The patrons are diverse and friendly. I know someone recently put up a negative post here recently, and without naming names, I can tell you that I witnessed the situation and the patron, a woman appeared intoxicated (despite the early hour), was getting touchy with a patron, and became argumentative. The bartender respectfully cut her off and patiently waited for her to leave. The bartenders always look out for their customers and make sure everyone has the opportunity to enjoy themselves.

This is everything a dive bar SHOULD be and it's gratifying to see some remnants of traditional NYC here: the locally-owned, locally-inhabited pub that doesn't cater to trends or fads-- this place just IS. Stand-out features include the music - played at the right volume and featuring a solid mix of indie rock / alt from the past decade, the beer list was solid with some really spectacular and unique draft choices that impressed me. Prices were right on point for the bar & location - and the people in the bar itself were friendly and chill. I will definitely come back again soon and might opt in as a guest bartender on a near future Thursday - would be great to host a party there!"

There also weren't many mock duck in it, there were much more mushrooms in it. Maybe it was an off day, but I think some other people also said that it was quite too salty too! The Dan Dan mian was really good, but still a tad salty. Both noodles were very chewy and yummy. The lychee lemonade was really good it helped to deal with the spice. Long line, be prepared to wait 30 minutes on line and for food, came around 1 for lunch. Lots of people, long line."

For ~$17 I'd say this is fair (and it's in Chelsea Market soooo...)Would def be back!"

We got the spicy vegan noodles with mock duck and those were absolutely fantastic. I've never had something so tasty. The mock duck was so good and the noodles were just so fresh. They were pretty spicy and left that tingling sensation in your mouth. I would recommend getting the boba with it to neutralize the spice and it also just makes the perfect combination and meal. I can't wait to go back!

Long line but went by fairly quickly, waited about 15 minutes to order and another 10 minutes for the food. Not bad considering how packed it was!Food/Pricing - Tingly & Spicy Cumin Lamb - $15.90 - If you enjoy the numbing spicy, this is the perfect dish for you! The lamb portion in this dish was generous (totally not complaining) and tender!Tingly & Spicy Cumin Beef - $15.75 - The beef was cut into small bits and although the taste was good, the meat was a bit tough for me.La Mei Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup (mild) - $15.95 - Not the soup taste I'm used to. This version seemed a bit more tomato-y than other beef noodle soups. The beef could be more tender.Service/Ambiance - Quick service! Luckily we were able to find a nice table outside.Parking - We walked to the market so not sure of the parking situation.Overall very enjoyable and highly recommend trying this place!"

Some of the best food I've ever had and tasted nothing like any of the food I've tried before. Went here with my boyfriend and he said the same. I got the spicy vegan noodles with mock ""duck"" (imitation), bok choy, & shiitake mushroom. Flavor: Salty and tangy broth. Perfect chewy texture of the hand pulled noodles. Veggies are perfect!Customer Service: Spot on! The guy taking orders is so friendly and full of energy considering the huge line we waited on. Seating: Limited indoor seating.

The hand-pulled biang biang noodles have a good bite to them, and the garnish is very fresh.I also love that the noodles come with a dry and soup option, and there's a good amount of vegan choices too. So much tastier than Xian Famous Foods (no offense). The flavor is just more nuanced. You get the right mix of sweet, sour, and spice and the dishes don't feel coated in oil. Will be back again!"
1330,66ndKMpJyowBx-GrvM4QvA,2/13/2023,4 star rating,"I was skeptical about this place given its location in Chelsea Market (like how authentic can Chinese food at Chelsea Market be?) and my high standards for hand-pulled noodles.I'd say for the most part, this place lives up to the hype. I tried both the beef noodle soup and the tingly lamb noodles- both had noodles with great texture (a tad softer than I like, but not a major ding) with great complex (and faithful to the original) sauces/soups. A tad heavy on the black vinegar, but that might just be the personal preference.To be honest, you can get a similar bowl of noodles in Flushing for $10, but I'll accept the Chelsea Market markup. Objectively, these noodles are still very tasty.Pro-tip- come on a weekday. There's no line compared to the cluster that is weekends here :)"

When I arrived to the pick up window, the girl didn't say anything to me. She didn't even tell me my total. She just stuck out her hand; when I hand her my debit card, she asked for ID. That really caught me off guard because this is WENDY'S, but I just gave it to her. Then after waiting for what felt like 50 years, she finally opens the window and hands me, with impressive force, the food and drink.Now I know this is fast food so you can't really expect too much, but a little courtesy would be nice. The only thing she said to me was when she asked for my ID. If that's how you train your employees, then god help you because you will lose all your business."

No professionalism stemming right down from the manager.

Wendy's is probably my favorite traditional fast food choice, but this location just doesn't make the cut.

Parm really fulfilled their namesake, and it was really a tasty, hearty, and generously portioned meal. The Aperol Spritz was tasty and not too strong, and my parents enjoyed the IPA.Overall, I would highly recommend this place to others and come back in a heartbeat."

However, what was delivered to me was wrong. I called, and explained but the girl began to tell me it was my error , even though I had the seamless order right in front of me! She began to berate me on the phone, saying I must be stupid for ordering the wrong thing but they would not change it. She even called Erica, one of the owners.I walked over to the restaurant and brought the wrong order, because I could not eat what they served me and I did not want it. Especially with the proof that they messed up my order, she laughed in my face and said they would not change it. Now, I have been going to this restaurant almost weekly. The blonde girl at the counter knew me, as do many of the employees I frequent their other family restaurant, Las Delicious, also.She would not change my order, AND she would not let me place another order.

(If you happen to see this, get in touch with me I would still like to pay you back) Yet when the food was brought out, not only was it not handed to me, it was thrown on the table in front of the woman who paid for me.I was a regular here, weekly almost if not biweekly. I order the same thing every time I go. That not only lack of customer service, but belittling me, laughing at me, and calling me names is not behavior from a restaurant! I also got in touch with seamless, as the owner suggested to get a refund, yet Sabor Peruano did not return their calls or emails. What kind of business it that? Although they do have very delicious food, they can not appreciate the customers who keep their business alive. That is why I can never go to my favorite restaurant again."

When I called to have them send the rest of my order that I paid for, they resent the delivery guy back to my building. Again waiting another hour for the rest of my food,  I called again out of frustration and they said that the delivery guy went home already and that they couldn't refund me back my money. Overall - I ordered my food at 7:25 and by 10pm didn't get my whole order and paid extra for sides and never received those either. NEVER got a refund and will NEVER EVER EVER order from here again. What shame"

Sat in the bar area and the waiter I had was very friendly and attentive. I ordered the Froze which got me nice and buzzed. As my food dish I ordered this pear salad they had which was AMAZING. I'd love to come back and try some of the pizzas. Four stars only because even though I was sitting inside I was getting torn up by mosquitos.

Not only was the ambiance great and perfect for a big group, but their pasta and mushroom pizza both tasted great. The red sauce rigatoni in particular was my favorite and since bottomless brunches often skimp on food quality this was great. Their drinks were regular and the tiramisu was pretty average, but I would still definitely recommend this spot for a celebration or big group brunch/dinner! -Navya J@nyconthetable"

I came here on a rainy Sunday for brunch--honestly, a perfect restaurant for that kind of day because the West Village in the rain is lovely. Sotto 13 has a great weekend brunch deal too. For $39 per person, you get a big mason jar of a cocktail (ours was the equivalent of 4 cocktails for two people), one side, one large dish, and two smaller brunch dishes.We ordered the champagne mule, side of potatoes, the mushroom truffle pizza, waffle BLT, and black currant french toast. We loved eeeeverything except the potatoes (next time I'd try the bacon instead, because the potatoes were just meh). I especially loved the french toast (nice and crispy, not too oily) and the waffle BLT (the sauce was really tasty). We were so full that we could only finish half the pizza, so we got the rest of it to go.I would definitely come back here for brunch; it's great for large parties too, because there's quite a lot of space (the back room has a nice sky light)."

They have a few outdoor tables, an intimate front bar room a d a spacious back dining area. Would definitely recommend a reservation on the busy weekend. For $39/person you get 90 minutes to have 3 different brunch plates, a side, and a bottle of brunch cocktail. They also have a build your own prosecco bar for an addition $29/person. We obviously had to try this and it was a really quite setup! In addition to our prosecco there were 4 different mixers (elderflower, Bellini, OJ, aperol) and fresh fruit to try with each glass. Loved this very cute and fun take on a cocktail brunch drink.For the entrees, we ordered the shroom pizza (delicious and cheesy with truffle oil sauce), eggs Benedict, side of bacon, and the black currant French toast. Everything was very good. I especially liked the French toast which was a perfect sweet bite. My only complaint is how quickly they brought out the food which made me think it was likely pre-prepared in batches. Would have been nice to have more spacing between courses. Overall, I had a fabulous experience here! I thought the food was delicious, good portion size, and the build your own prosecco bar was clever and interactive. Would recommend!"

The sidewalk is relaxing, the interior sets a vibe.The Yellow Fin tuna tartare nestled on some guacamole...top notch. The pear salad was sharp and fresh. The pastas were excellent. I wasn't sure how lamb sausage and octopus would mix but I had nothing to be concerned about. I'm looking forward to more meals there."

The place was not very crowded but they sat us near the bar in the front. My friend was a little late but whatever. We order around 1:45 got our drinks & food & everything is really good. Around 10 to 3 the waiter comes over & tells us we have to leave by 3 however we weren't done. He brought the check & again said we had to leave & kept coming back to say we have to leave. It was really rude & I didn't appreciate being pushed out like that. The waiter looked annoyed we were even there the whole time. We won't be back & no I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

When we got there, our table wasn't ready. In fact, there were no tables available due to two parties in the back. After waiting fifteen minutes past our reservation time, they tried to sit us in the front area which was noisy as the bar is also located there. With no interest in dining in the middle of an after work happy hour setting, we opted to leave instead. So much for making a reservation!"
1373,eFcFFe0Z4H1QMn1PaRi-MQ,6/7/2021,2 star rating,"The food was decent, ambiance was nice, but the staff and the way the brunch works were so complicated!I put in a reservation Thursday for 5 people  Saturday morning. When we showed up, the host says he doesn't have a table and tried to say it's because I booked last minute. I stared at him for a few seconds because I was trying to remember, and he insisted pretty hard too, ready to defend himself and put the blame on me. Then the host gave me this long winded explanation too of how he puts reservations on one system and has to transfer it over to another system? The whole conversation was silly, but he figured it out and got us a table so we gave it a chance.THEN THE WAITER - So the place opens at 11, we have this reservation for 11am,  but couple of people were late (11:15/30) and we are interested in the bottomless drinks menu. The website says we can enjoy it for 1.5 hours. There are multiple drinks on the menu and carafes that can be shared between two people- so naturally, we picked a couple flavors. The waiter says, ""No, no only the mimosa is bottomless""; Ok so we ask him to disregard the flavors and get us the bottomless; then he goes ""Oh no, the bottomless brunch is only until 12pm.. you guys should have showed up earlier""- so OK FINE WE WILL JUST STICK WITH THE CARAFES WE PICKED IN THE FIRST PLACEThen we are trying to pick the family-style food, but we have a member in our group who is vegetarian. So we were thinking of asking for half meat, half margherita pizza. When we asked, they said ""oh no, we can't do that, we can only serve one flavor"" and gave us all kinds of excuses. But when they served, they gave us two pizzas (pictured below)!! We confronted them saying, ""why didn't you let us know we will get two pizzas in the first place? We couldn't ask for 1 plain, 1 meat?"" The server came up with all kinds of stuff ""oh that's not what the chef does"" ""that's not how we do things""; guys, please, not even an option to pay a little extra ?I felt pretty bad leaving this restaurant such a harsh review; but it just seemed like the staff was really going out of their way to make their customers feel stupid. I was really looking forward to this experience though; and I will say that this is a place that's in a great neighborhood and always popping, lots of people"

It's in my neighborhood and after each of my 3 visits, the food was consistently bland and gross. Rice was overcooked mush, meat was bland and flavorless, guacamole had mystery chunks, wilted brown slimy lettuce. It's a shame because my boys love the kids meals and the location is so convenient. I wish they would get it together."

There was no brown rice left, they were just making it, there was also no chicken at all they said wait about 10 minutes for it. If you're starving do you really want to wait 10 minutes? As it couldn't get any worse when I asked for guacamole I was told they ran out and that was it!  Common sense would suggest you probably will get busy on Friday night and might run out of things quickly but I guess that's too much to ask for. It's not like this is a some fancy restaurant and stuff will run out, it's a chain restaurant with very limited food selection. As I was paying I looked back there was about 13 people in line waiting to get disappointed!"

I'm vegetarian, and my meal had beans switched from black to pinto because they were out of black beans. The pintos have meat in them, and as a result I got incredibly ill for several days.

1384,h94_F0reiSFE-8jFRA8tBA,6/4/2021,4 star rating,"As a lover of the square slice, I simply needed to stop by Upside Pizza while I was in the area. I heard about their cold-fermented dough that about 72 hours to rise, which was a major selling point to me. If the dough is no good, the pizza is just wasted. I had the pepperoni square ($5) which was an instant flavor bomb of salty, porky goodness in my mouth. The cheesy frico crust was chewy but crisp, and so buttery. This slice is not shy about its flavors at all! I will say, however, that it's best to ask them to warm up your slice a little longer in the oven, especially on a busy day where they might forget to check the time."
1385,h94_F0reiSFE-8jFRA8tBA,11/21/2022,5 star rating,"Best mushroom slice I've ever had I think and I've had so many. Often they look much better than they are but not this time, flavorful roasted mushrooms and small amounts of good cheese rather than gobs of gooey garbage cheese.  Excellent toppings and exceptional crust, thin, crispy and still a little chewy. Can't speak to the other slices, the Sicilian LOOKS a little goofy but the round pie crust is delightful. Bonus for actually having fountain soda which, as a large child like adult, I consider a necessary accompaniment to pizza."
1386,h94_F0reiSFE-8jFRA8tBA,7/21/2021,4 star rating,"Solid slice in midtown. The pizza guys from Upside just gets it. The crust is crispy but soft. The sauce has the perfect balance between acidic and sweetness, and the cheese is pretty awesome too. Please keep in mind that there are not tables at this location. You would order your slice, wait until you're called and then fold and eat (it doesn't get any more NY than that). Prices are reasonable a for the quality of the food. The slices are average size and the service is good (pizza guy is pretty friendly). I tired the mushroom white slice, and the pepperoni square both were excellent. The only reason I would not give it 5 stars is because of the location. We all know 8th Avenue is not the best place to eat a slice on the street. Other than that go and get your pizza and go elsewhere to enjoy it."

Pretty inexpensive, quick service, and a lot of options.I've had a few of the sandwiches (there are probably almost 20 options total) and all of them have been really good (you choose the type of bread you want, too, so that's always a plus)! I also recently tried their tomato basil soup --  I got the 1/2 sandwich, soup and drink special for about $11 -- and the soup was AMAZING. It's a decent portion and it was really flavorful. Will definitely get that again.There are pre-made salads as well if you're looking for an even quicker grab-and-go option.There are about 10 tables inside and I've never seen more than a couple filled at a time -- most people order and take it to go.

1402,fdaS1XvbEwWNIcLqv2C6Vw,9/6/2019,4 star rating,"This is a really solid lunch place in an area where pickings are pretty slim. Dill chicken salad is my new favorite -- solid scoop (or maybe two) of good chicken salad with walnuts and golden raisins mixed in, over mesclun with 3-4 green apple slices and a small piece of bread. Balsamic dressing. Really good stuff.Tuna salad (with mesclun and sliced tomato) is also good. Ask for an extra dressing (free) because just the one that comes with the salad isn't enough. At least that's what I find.The sandwiches are pretty good too, I've had tuna and Italian-type. My one quibble is that the half sandwiches aren't quite enough for lunch, but the whole sandwiches are way too much. Overall this is a great lunch option for like a very reasonable $10 (no drink, I get it to go). Beats the heck out of other nearby delis where you may get lunch for a buck or two cheaper but quality can't compare."
1403,fdaS1XvbEwWNIcLqv2C6Vw,2/21/2013,4 star rating,"The most hilarious thing is that this is an Italian themed sandwich/soup/salad run mostly by Asians with Mexicans doing delivery and prep.But it works.Chicken salad sandwich on wheat was pretty decent. Wasn't covered entirely in mayo, but wasn't dry either. Basic stuff.Service is quick and the turnover rate of the salads and sandwich supplies seems good. Lots of foot traffic around lunchtime and they also deliver/cater.They also sell gigantic cookies for $1.75. Didn't get a chance to try them, but I'd like return to try that and their coffee.Note that sandwiches are $8.45 but come out over $9 with tax, but I'm putting it on my Midtown West Under $9 Yelp list anyway. They accept cards though."

Mushroom steam buns and short rib steam buns to start- mushroom bordered on too salty but otherwise had phenomenal flavor. Short rib was fairly lean but excellent flavor as well. I liked them lean but my husband prefers the richer cuts. Ramen was also fine. I had the mushroom seafood option and he had the kimchi pork... Kimchi had great flavor and mushroom was a little bland (added some kimchi to mine. for more taste), Although the kimchi pork had good flavor it was almost too overpowering to enioy the whole bowl. My seafood lacked flavor and was rathr tough. We didn't have sushi but everything around us looked fresh and we'll prepared."

Soy Garlic Chicken Wings (3.5/5): had an okay sauce, but was definitely nothing spectacular especially since the sauce didn't really cook into the chicken. Kimchi Ramen (4/5): tasted pretty good, but the broth was way too salty.Tonkotsu Ramen (3/5): nothing spectacular; broth was overly garlic-y; I had a random edamame in mine that I choked on; pork belly was definitely cut down on (3 small pieces)Overall, nothing impressive, but the atmosphere is very pleasant!"

Was immediately seated. After looking at the menu, the two of us decided to get the Hama (yellowtail belly with ponzu sauce?), premium sushi and tonkotsu shoyu ramen.Hama: $20 for 6 pieces. Ponzu sauce is wayyyy too strong. Premium sushi: $38, 10 pieces with a roll. Mediocre. Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen: $20, other then the pork is not fatty enough. It was above average.Since we have 30 mins to kill, we asked for their greentea tiramisu $10. It came shortly after. If you throw that at someone, it could be a murder weapon. That thing is hard like a rock. The picture is the aftermath of us trying to get a good piece of the tiramisu. We tried that tiny dent we made, it has a very strong favor of greentea. After that it comes the taste of the refrigerator. Here what came worst, the servers saw us with the untouched tiramisu when we asked for the checks and didn't bother asking anything. TLDR: Pricing is too high for the mediocre food. If you must dine here, stick with their ramen."

If you're a vegetarian, they have many options to choose from, ranging from vegetarian, avocado rolls, the mushroom streamed buns, vegetarian ramen and veggie fried rice. They also have ample vegetarian starters (caramelized Brussel sprouts) and appetizers. I had the veggie fried rice which was the perfect blend of rice and vegetables such as mushrooms, corn, spring onions etc. Plenty of drinks and beverages to select from as well.

The ramen was very filling and had a ton of toppings with many more toppings you can add. I added the nori and mushrooms which very good with it. Again, a little pricey but the food was solid and the vibes were very chill."

Let's start off by saying that it's still a great deal here with the $2.99 soju special. Along with our liquor, we enjoyed a tasty plate of fries and fried chicken. I seriously love their fried chicken...really i do.... The bad part of the night was the pot of mussels we ordered. We had ordered the item before and it was excellent as per my initial review. However, this time the pot of mussels was plain nasty. The mussels had sand and they never bothered to remove the beards. I don't know about you guys....but I'm not using the beard as a handle to eat a mussel. It's just plain disgusting if you ask me... Last night's experience was probably worth 1 or 2 stars. But i feel that Incheon really is a 4 or 5 star place. I'll say 3 stars for now until i go back. Just make sure you ask them if they're going to remove the beards off the mussels before ordering the soup."

First big thing, the place is authentic and you do need to speak Korean. They have no English menus either. My friend and I are not Korean and we stumbled through ordering and got some really good food nevertheless. In addition to some tasty freebies. The $3 soju bottles are amazing. It was just the 2 of us and we had 4 bottles for the cost of 1 bottle elsewhere. I'll definitely check it out again but with someone that can speak and read Korean!"

I ordered my dish but they came back in like 20 minutes later telling me that they don't have it so i would have to order something else. they could have told me earlier so I don't waste my time.2. One of their side dishes, the sushi rolls are a joke. The rice was so dry like it's been sitting somewhere for hours. Why don't they just get rid of bad side dishes? it's better to have few good side dishes than to have many including the awful ones.2. The waitor wasn't very welcoming though we tipped him 3. Our dishes came out to be $38 but the grand total was $42. I told the waitor that there's something wrong with this bill but the waitor told me $4 is for the tax. I felt like I was being ripped off because NY tax is max %8.875......we didn't wanna argue with them and ruin the night so we paid for it. We even TIPPED the guy. Now I regret it and just don't wanna go back there. And I'm gonna remember to tell people my story when they wanna go to this restaurant.Overall their food is okay, but if they're going to keep ripping off their customers, I'm pretty sure people are gonna complain about the stuff I said."

When I went in on 11:30 a.m. on its opening morning, the bagels were ALL SOLD OUT! Most of their pastries were gone. All that was left was coffee, basically. Ha! Needless to say, we've all had our eyes on that mysterious black ""Inwood Bagels"" awning for quite a few weeks now, and we were clearly all ready to pounce.A bagel shop is hard to come by uptown - save for the wonderful Mike's down on 168th and Broadway - so the arrival of this place is exciting! They have a multitude of bagels to choose from, many kinds of cream cheese (even chocolate chip!), a large array of pastries including Dough Doughtnuts (OH MY GOSH, YES!), and La Columbe coffee. In addition, they also have a fridge with a small array of bottled beverages and meals - to - go, as well as a nice array of grocery products to buy. I saw cookies, energy bars, and, yes, even some boxes of Annie's Mac & Cheese! As for the bagels and cream cheese themselves, I can only speak for the plain bagels and garlic herb cream cheese - I'll experiment more over the next few weeks, haha - but the bagel had a nice crisp exterior and a doughy center. The cream cheese did not skimp on the garlic, either. I was a happy camper!Oh, I'll be a regular at Inwood Bagels soon enough. ;-)"

I'm a huge fan of italian pastries and i can't say that D'aquila is one of my favorites anymore. I always go back to them hoping that they're back on point but I'm always disappointed. Today i purchased half a pound of their rainbow cookies and wasn't pleased. The cookies had very little raspberry inbetween, and they're very dry!  The perfect kind of rainbow cookie for me is enough raspberry so i can taste it, a bit dense and just a little mosit.  This cookie wasn't it."

They do the Italian classics really well, great cannolis, napoleons and spumoni. Almost perfect apple pie (they add raisins, of which I'm not a fan). Solid cookies. They have a unique looking tiramisu that doesn't taste anything like coffee, which I like but most tiramisu fans probably won't. Around Easter the Easter bread is great. The one item I get every time I go are the ""little white cakes"", which are probably petit fours. Their like a tiny layer cake, and the outside is covered in very sweet hard white frosting. They have gelato & struffoli, but I've never tried them. I've been coming here for a long time and have never gotten anything that was stale.

I stopped by this evening around the dinner rush and was shocked I only had to wait 20 minutes for a table for a party of 3.When we were seated, we immediately flagged down a waiter to let them know we were ready to place our order and to my surprise, we were able to put in our order shortly afterwards.I ordered the very spicy, light fatty, seasonal tomato ramen with extra firm noodles and it was everything I was looking for in a bowl of ramen. The broth was flavorful like tomato egg, the charsu was not overly fatty, and the noodles were perfectly cooked -- similar to the texture of egg noodles in Hong Kong stir-fry dishes. I had no problem whatsoever finishing up the bowl of ramen, including all the broth. I wish I came hungrier, because I definitely would've added on a half order of noodles for $1, or a full order for $2. The ramen noodles here are fantastic. I would definitely stop by here again for another bowl of ramen."

We were so happy that Danbo survived the pandemic, as it is consistently serves the best bowl of ramen in the area. However, I am updating my review to four stars to reflect consistently mediocre service. I can't remember the last time I went to Danbo without some server issue: Either water glasses don't get refilled, or  food comes out at vastly different times, or kaedama takes forever, or servers are generally inattentive and apathetic. I never enjoy my experience at Danbo, but I am locked in as a customer because the food is phenomenal."

The restaurant itself was quite packed, and you have to sign up on a waitlist to get a table. Our wait didn't end up being too long (around 15-20 mins), but this was also on a weekday."

1456,eyqVOLoOLrqZ98_QhdPXqg,2/25/2022,3 star rating,"River is a pretty standard chinese owned sushi joint, common in the boroughs. But if you're looking for an all around safe bet for AYCE (All You Can Eat) sushi spot in the area - River, along with several others nearby, will all suffice. With sashimi, there really isn't anything that is fresh out of the water - because sushi fish is infact, all frozen and thawed (unless you go where the catch is infact local, seasonal etc). There's no salmon, tuna, yellowtail off the waters of Queens incase you were wondering and so when one talks about freshness, you're really just measuring the freshness of the block of fish that's being served. Temperature, storage, shelf life, handling and how all of these things are controlled in order to serve the customer, is what essentially measures freshness at these kinds of sushi outposts. River consistently does fine with this. While there is a good selection of Maki and Hand Rolls, Specialty Rolls and hot kitchen food, we fill up on the Sashimi. Salmon, Tuna, Yellowtail, Striped Bass, Clam and Red Snapper. (They do have White Tuna as well but FYI, there's no such thing as 'real' White Tuna anywhere.)Service is fine, nothing exceptional but never rude or falling short. And honestly their Rolls have a good rice to filling ratio and we do have a few kitchen dishes we actually really do enjoy.Currently AYCE price Weekday Lunch is $33, Holiday and Weekend Lunch is $36. Not sure about Dinner prices. Of course, there is a full A La Carte menu which many people enjoy this place for."

Man, I felt so insulted when I opened up my seaweed salad and saw that it is 90% lettuce. I was so excited for that appetizer. Seaweed salad - 0/5 for shame!Angel roll - 3/5 - the only non-rice roll, so I was curious. It was pretty good, didn't blow my mind, but I recommend it for a solid salmon/tuna mix.  Black dragon roll - 4/5 this roll was above average, but I wish there was more eel! They put just a little sliver on top, and I feel like for this price, you should be getting more. Overall, I wouldn't say their sushi is impressive, but it's not subpar, either. I'd come back for the AYCE if they ever do that again."

Special rolls favorites - Phoenix roll (the seared salmon is chefs kiss gorgeous), Springfield rollSashimi tastes sooo fresh and the cut on each fish is thick, I wish I got pics. Eating a pickled ginger in between each sashimi is def the move to really enhance the flavor of each fish ur about to eat. We always pay in cash to get that discount btw.

Honey, IT'S THAT BAD. There is no benefit of the doubt.I've been to this River location multiple times in the past and had pretty decent experiences. But I don't know what happened in the last couple of months. Everything has gone downhill. Close to $400 for AYCE for a party of 8? 18% tip for garbage service? Seriously?Upon being seated, we were told the wait for any sushi bar order would take 25-30 minutes because they're backed up with orders or whatever. Okay.. so we proceed to place our first order for both the sushi bar and kitchen, ordering sashimi, 4-5 rolls, and multiple appetizers to share. Considering we were a party of 8, we wrote mostly 2's or 3's under quantity for each order on the kitchen menu. Hands in our order and the wait begins. We get our drinks & soup in the first 10 minutes. YAY! 30 minutes later, we finally get appetizers. Instead of receiving 2-3 orders for each appetizer, we get ONE of whatever they wanted to wanted to make. At this point, we're missing more than half of our appetizers. (Which doesn't come to my surprise because this has been an ongoing issue at both River location for years now.) But USE SOME COMMON SENSE! How do you serve a party of 8 ONE of each order. Are we supposed to split the already small portions into tinier ones?Now we're sitting at the table waiting for more food.. Sushi, appetizers, ANYTHING we ordered really. And nothing. Another 30 minutes, we finally get a plate of the rolls we ordered. Of course, still missing half the order. Lovely! So we ask for another menu and repeat. 2-3 quantities of sushi & kitchen items. As a server was passing by, I handed her our second order. And we wait again. I overheard the table next to us saying they waited over an hour for a plate of sushi rolls. Wow. Just wow. And they've been sitting there since we stepped foot into the restaurant.Still waiting for food.. Mind you, we're now over an hour and a half close to two hours into dinner. We then stopped one of the other servers to ask if our food is coming and she quickly checked with the kitchen and came back with ""No. There's no order in."" NO??? What exactly do you mean NO? COME ON MAN. You're joking right? I handed this girl our order 20-30 minutes ago and you're telling me no?! SHE BASICALLY FORGOT ABOUT OUR ORDER.. She then told us there are no orders anymore and that we can order again and they'll make it for us. Appreciate that but TWO HOURS LADY. We've been here for almost TWO HOURS and you guys served us not even half our first order. We don't even have the appetite to eat sushi anymore. We ended up ordering 4 noodles and dessert and got our check.I've worked at a restaurant. I know how hectic it can get with dine-in and a load of take-out orders. My advice, if you can't even serve food to your customers dining in, DON'T DO TAKE-OUT. PICK ONE AND STICK WITH IT. DON'T JUST FOCUS ON TAKE-OUT ORDERS IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE SITTING IN YOUR RESTAURANT WAITING HOURS FOR FOOD. Plus, if a large party is just sitting there looking around, does it not click in your head that maybe they're waiting on something? Like FOOD? Not a single worker cared to come up to our table to even ask.The best part? The bill. $36 for AYCE per person is the dinner price. That's super reasonable, IF YOU GET FOOD. But 2+ hours and close to $400 plus tax & 18% tip that they charge you? Get outta here. What are we paying for? To drink tea and soda until we're full? We're leaving on half empty stomachs because you guys had one job, and couldn't do that.To anyone considering AYCE sushi, honestly, if you're willing to travel or commute, go somewhere else. You can find many other places in all five boroughs with better service and leave with a happy tummy. Or spend the money at sushi restaurants that offer party trays and what not because River's just not it."

1465,ygFhVaqGG6-nrTSG3OWolw,5/10/2022,3 star rating,"It was Mother's Day-The food was tasty but overpriced and the portions were stingy. Ordered a risotto and it was barely a scoop. Most Italian restaurants are known for their generous portions- not this place.Definitely not worth their inflated prices.The first floor was dark and did not have a welcoming ambiance. Old and dingy looking. It was too chilly to sit outdoors. The table was wobbly and the 5 of us were squished in a corner. The restaurant was not full- no need to squeeze people into a corner. Bathrooms are upstairs- not good for someone with mobility issues.  However, the dining room upstairs was brighter and more inviting but small.Staff did not even say Happy Mother's Day- waiters lacked personality.  After reading all the reviews- a true disappointment."

Not sure why I haven't gone to IL Falco sooner because the food is really, really good. Already had the black squid ink pasta with seafood and the spicy garlic angel hair pasta and I have to say it's one of the best pastas I've had in recent memory. The meatballs doesn't contain fillers so they are really meaty. The sauce is fantastic too. Why people don't talk about IL Falco more, I don't know but they should. The food here is fantastic."
1467,ygFhVaqGG6-nrTSG3OWolw,8/19/2021,5 star rating,"A great Italian option in the LIC area! I would say it's hidden off of the popular area for restaurants (along Jackson Ave), so it might not be as bustling, but it's a place worth visiting. They got great service there, plenty of different options/daily specials, and awesome food! One of the daily specials they had was a rack of lamb, which my friend and I thoroughly enjoyed :)If you're willing to put the money in, I'd say the food at Il Falco is worth it."

1469,ygFhVaqGG6-nrTSG3OWolw,4/17/2022,2 star rating,"Ordered for delivery the lobster bisque, lobster ravioli and penne vodka with shrimp. I couldn't drink the soup- it was incredibly watery and tart. I have never NOT inhaled and completely finish my pastas... until this order. The penne à la vodka was okay- probably the best out of the three ordered. The lobster ravioli had so few pieces (yet didn't even finish) and below average quality and taste. For around $100 for these three items, I do not think it was worth the price. Maybe it was an off day as most reviews are astounding but the prices and this experience definitely does not make me feel like it's worth another try."

When a simple capellini with spicy tomato sauce keeps you coming back time and again, you know they are the REAL DEAL. Husband and I have tried almost all the pastas and starters from the menu, though it wasn't until recently that we actually stopped in for dinner. So happy we got the full experience and tried a few specials. Had a lovely evening on the back patio. Please keep supporting them, so we can keep this gem in LIC!"

We had order a bunch of appetizers. The oysters were so fresh and mouth watering. The meat and cheese plate was perfect to pick from. The caprese was light and refreshing. Then for dinner the spaghetti bolognese was unreal and my boyfriend got the chicken Parmesan which he couldn't get over. The flavors were so delicious it really stuffed us. To end this great night we got espresso martinis which were strong and superb ! My only flaw with this place was the service was a bit slow with little things like giving us menus or getting our drink orders to the tables. Otherwise I will highly recommend it !

After checking the reviews, I picked up a box of the rainbow cookie/cakes. These were delicious, one of the best and most unique desserts I tried in the city. The thin layer of jam between the colored cake tiers was a tasty touch. Also got an iced coffee, good and can't complain. There was only one barista and she was very slammed- when it got busy she handled it well! Definitely try this place if you are in the area looking for a unique yet lowkey NYC cafe experience."
1475,U0QlNZX8FVwiXCIIaHqhGw,8/19/2022,5 star rating,"I thought I understood that a chocolate lace cookie, while the very thing with which one should treat oneself when near an Italian bakery, would never quite meet the ideal of what it was intended to be -- as chewy as a caramel, but not thick enough to risk a tooth on it, as crunchy as a bowl of rice krispies, but not crackling enough to remind you of  a pretzel, sweet and chocolatey but not sickeningly sweet or lame-quality-chocolatey.There has been no chocolate lace cookie before this one and there shall never be another.  Rocco's is a distant memory.  Veniero's can't compete.  The chocolate lace cookie at Cafe Belle is the Platonic Ideal of a chocolate lace cookie, too good for this plane of existence.  Cafe Belle!  Cafe Belle!  Cafe Belle!"

1479,U0QlNZX8FVwiXCIIaHqhGw,10/24/2019,5 star rating,"I'm writing this review as I'm still sitting here in this cafe, because this is how much I love it!Cafe Belle is a quaint little Italian cafe that serves authentic, homemade Italian pastries and coffee. It seems like an under-the-radar cafe, tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the adjoining neighborhoods. There aren't too many seats inside, but the cafe compensates for that with free wifi, a clean restroom, friendly service, and its adorable floral decor.Over the span of the hours I spent here, I ordered a Spinach and Feta turnover, a large drip coffee, and a raspberry rugelach. The turnover was buttery, flaky, delicious, with the perfect filling to pastry ratio. The rugelach was one of the best I've ever had. The raspberry filling definitively tasted of real raspberries, making me believe their claim that they shy away from using artificial ingredients. It was sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth, but not sickeningly so. My coffee was eye-openingly strong and the perfect pick-me-up my afternoon needed.I selfishly want Cafe Belle to be my best kept secret and to shelter it from the traffic of the city, but I believe that everyone should have the chance to sample a taste of Naples. I'll be back soon for more pastries!"

We ordered a vanilla bean latte with oat milk and nutella croissant. The barista was super friendly and both the latte (you could taste the vanilla bean, I've never had anything like it before) and the croissant were so delicious. The vanilla bean latte was so good we had to get an extra one to go. I would absolutely go out of my way to come back here just for the latte. Prices were also reasonable, especially given the area, although they did charge for oat milk. Would recommend!"

My husband and I randomly stumbled upon this after a quick trip to REI across the street. We hadn't had any breakfast so we went inside and ordered: one iced coffee, one iced matcha latte, and a piece of nutella banana bread slice. We sat outside on the cafe's table and chairs ( which again are so adorable.) Everything was delicious and I will definitely come back again. I can't wait to come back to try the Italian rainbow ice cream sandwich....drool."

The ambiance is lovely , uplit arches something like the gaudi viaduct . The service was exceptional . Attentive , prompt , silent where preferred , engaging where desired. The wine list is robust and they had a fabulous selection of amarone. Prix fixe with the determines 3 antipasti were lovely and balanced  but maybe a tad  rushed . This was made up with the proper primi and entrees . Pacing was great , presentation was flawless and taste was so magnificently balanced . We had the pappardelle  with the veal and pork shank and orange ... which was exquisitely finished .  I really can't describe the perfect finish and balance . My wife's gnocchi melted in our mouths in the literal sense  the flavors were great.For entrees she has the scallops with prosciutto and a sauce I'm convinced that was served to Odysseus with the sirens . I had the duck with potatoes that, while a side dish , were perfectly complimentary and exceptional in and of themselves . The duck was perfectly cut and the fat expertly reduced . The sauce was a tad sweet but still great . Apple tart and a flourless chocolate cake for dessert with a pistachio gelato that would make you cry . Overall , this is what I wanted out of my New York trip and got it . Highly recommend ."

They were quite busy, and we had to wait around 10 minutes for our table, which they profusely apologized for, and provided us with complimentary prosecco.

I had asked for reservations at The River Cafe, but it was booked. My husband and I are glad that we dined here instead. Taking food, service, decor and cost into consideration I'll put Scalini at the top of my list in NYC. Scalini occupies the old Bouley space, and it is as beautiful as I remembered. Our Captain, a mature man, was very polite and very solicitous. My husband and I dine in Italian restaurants frequently, but the kitchen at Scalini excelled in ways that others don't. The highlights of the evening were Porcini Ravioli in Black Truffle sauce. Pork Chop San Domenico, and warm flourless Chocolate Cake with Pistacchio and Amarena Cherry. Very delicious!"

Both pastas that we had for our first course, the linguine carbonara and the butternut agnolotti, were excellent. For our entrees, the mushroom and black truffle crusted Arctic char was prepared nicely and about the only dish that didn't blow us away, though still good, was the duck breast. Our terrific waiter Piero (who was very helpful and entertaining) recommended the chocolate torte and the chocolate soufflé for dessert and he was spot on - both were great.Overall, great food in a classy, traditional atmosphere."

From the moment we walked in the door, to the ""thank you for dining with us"" on the way out, we were treated like royalty. The complimentary amuse bouches and pre-dessert are lovely, the menu is so inventive it is very hard to choose, and the wine list compliments it all. Between the four of us there were 4 different primi, 3 different entrees and 3 different desserts. Though it may not be PC during Covid to eat off of each other's plates, most of us did safely manage to get a taste of everything, and it was all flawless with a gorgeous presentation, perfect execution and wonderful depth of flavor. You would be hard pressed to find a better meal at any price anywhere."

Always so light and fluffy that you will feel like eating two slices even if you are not a sweets fan. The cream is perfectly sweet and light as well. Usually I try not to eat all the cream when it comes to dessert, but I can't help but do so with this cake! When you think of a good Chinese cake that you and your fam will both enjoy, Yeh's does it TEXTBOOK. I've also had their taro and chestnut cakes many years back, and remember them being amazing as well. Also, the pricing is hard to beat! I believe you can get a good sized cake for $28."

I have seen the prices go up, but I definitely understand from a business perspective. It's only fair when prices for other items go up (essentials like boxes, fruit, anything necessary to maintain the business), that prices for the goods go up with it. I mean a pandemic just hit so of course these things are impacted. It's not fair for a business to take a loss or penalty, so it's understandable! And even with the price increase, I still think everything is worth it and inexpensive.I really really love the rolls here, something about them hit different compared to other bakeries. One of the things I love about this place is that they can accommodate to assembling a last minute cake order when I'm running late from work and I have no time to order prior. I haven't seen other bakeries have this option that I'm aware of! They have saved me for so many events. Their coffee and savory buns are amazing too :)"

Though it's called a Boston cream pie don't be mistaken that it's a heavy sweet taste of a donut. It's actually the opposite, a light and fluffy creamy sponge cake.

One savory, one sweet. I was obsessed after seeing Mike C's picture of a croissant with sweet goodness in the middle. My recreation consisted of a croissant PBJ and bananas, toasted. Deeelish!!My savory sandwich order consisted of a concoction my dear brother used to make me over at Dagwood & Scoops (SF, CA!! Shout out). Ciabatta, turkey, ham, brie, lettuce and pickles, toasted. I added a light order of spicy mayo which was the perfect amount of spice. Ingredients were fresh. Delivery was prompt within 30 mins of my order. Sandwiches arrived a little warm but that's understandable given the distance. The prices are reasonable as well. I don't normally like to order from places who charge a delivery fee, which this place does. 3 bucks. But it's an experience and definitely something to try out."

My family has been eating here for over 40 years and it always tastes consistently amazing and is reasonably priced for what you get.  I think it's way better than the other Spanish options in Manhattan and has a lovely old fashioned, warm authentic feel to it. Go for the Paella Valenciana for a crowd pleaser and share it for 2. Other stand out dishes for me include the Shrimp Creole, Veal Extremena, Red Snapper and Muscles. Top it off with a pitcher of delicious Sangria and thank me later."

In this area a lot of the food spots the customer service is lacking but not at this establishment. The staff are always welcoming and very nice. They also move quickly even when it is busy they get you seated in a reasonable amount of time. I have not had any issues with my food either. I will continue coming to this Location because they offer great service and the food is good as well.

Very friendly atmosphere and good service. Only drawback I have had here was recently when I cam to iHop for National Pancake day. I had a 3 stack of pancakes and chicken tenders. The tenders which I've had in the past were good, the pancakes however...ehh not so much. Don't know if it was because they felt it was a rush order since in fact it was National Pancake Day or if that is how their pancakes taste on a regular basis cause when I do come here I usually get scrambled eggs and waffles which is really good. The pancakes though tasted really bland and adding syrup to it barely helped. Guess I'll be making my own pancakes next year for NPDay but I'll still come here for the scrambled eggs, waffles and good service."

Cons: Chicken vindaloo was too hot even for someone who's palate likes spicy. The rice that came with the was stuck together in clumps.Mixed vegetable curry was ok. Vegetable biryani couldn't eat it at all. It tasted like perfume not meant to be eaten was dropped in the mix. I understand that aromatic spices are part of the appeal but this was like something that shouldn't be added to food. Won't order again."

1539,wJhm-RhgPhvlqF80s5D49Q,5/29/2013,4 star rating,"3.7To finish laterwell this a whole lot different than the Swagat on Amsterdam and a whole lot better.Seems like most of the bad reviews come from people ordering curries or Chicken Tikka Masala or looking for a nicer place. To be honest:1. The people are nice 2. The food is inexpensive, dishes range from 1.50 to 9, most expensive dishes are curries obviously outside of the couple fish dishes2. The place is clean regardless of the rating3. You get gigantic portions4. The medium is hotter than the watery Chicken Curry junk Tikka Korma Vindaloo from next door from your place for 12 bucks5. The portion is larger than said curry6. Most dishes are vegetarian7. The Lassi is bad and they don't care8. Communal water/cups9. You get your own silverwareIn short, no health rating, a lot of vegetarian dishes, nothing labeled, no problems.Anyway, little place. Went here for lunch and had a Mysore Masala Dosa. For anyone who hasn't had a Dosa it is basically a thick yet flaky bread made from lentils and rice batter (almost like a pancake but much softer wrapped around itself with a filing of some sort. It is a specialty of South Indian areas. Masala is a chickpea/potato/onlon filling and the Masala filling her is generously spiced and delicious. Mysore is a very spicy red pepper/cumin based spread.So in other words it is a large pancake stuffed with potatoes and peas with pepper around the outside. It is quite filling and quite spicy.It comes with a small stew named Sanbar (made out of peas and lentils with some spices such as pepercorns and cumin, a bit above average) and a very good coconut chutney (a lot of coconut pieces with some light spices.)It's 5.95 for a regular Masala Dosa and 6.50 for the red stuff/Mysore. Inexpensive and quite good. I'm sold.On another note, the woman is nice but the cashier was not, but the place has good food so I wont' care too much."

I asked her what was so funny. Then she leaned over and whispered ""Indian food makes me horny""....so I calmly raised my hand and toward our server and said ""check please!"" It was at that point that I had figured out the Kama Sutra. Maybe it's creation was birthed from the innate sense of sexual arousal from eating Indian food. Ok so about this place. Very good. Naan was perfect. Tiki masala was the best I've ever had. Goat curry excellent. Very authentic. You could really taste the spices. And since they got an A on their health inspection I hold it in high respect as Indian restaurants go which are notorious for poor sanitation. This place gets street cred in my book"

1544,zpBPFg9_BNLI3tXS9AWLYg,12/9/2020,4 star rating,"I waited a year to write this review, wanting to give this adorable neighborhood cafe a few visits before I was overly critical about what could be anomaly experiences. Over the course of several visits I now know that a good amount of patience is required to reap the benefits of the tasty bites and nicely caffeinated drinks this mother-son duo create. I've admittedly come away from this cafe feeling frustrated-- on one visit the food took an hour to prepare, without warning. I called ahead to place an order before another visit, and still it didn't seem to save any time-- but I don't think this cafe should be written off because of it. They've created a nice community space in a neighborhood that could use more hubs like it, featuring merchandise from local artists and introducing people to their own unique twist on Caribbean food.Their wraps are sizeable and delicious, with a generous amount of protein and plenty of flavor. I tried the shrimp wrap on my first visit a year ago and though it took a very long time to make, it was really delicious. More recently I've enjoyed their rice bowls, which came with a side of creamed spinach, sliced avocado, plantains, and a protein. Both the chicken rice bowl and salmon rice bowl I ordered contained a huge portion of protein, almost enough to eat over two meals. I'm really not a fan of their pastries, especially not their cookies, but I don't think they make them in house. They taste like they're mass produced. The food on the other hand, tastes like it was made with love and very fresh.Visit for their savory food, but prepare to stay a while."

The food was amazing and the atmosphere was refreshing from the busy streets. The ginger pineapple juice was sweet and refreshing but the iced chai latte is one of the best I've ever tasted. I will definitely be returning to try everything on the menu! I would have taken more pictures but the food was too good I couldn't wait!
1546,zpBPFg9_BNLI3tXS9AWLYg,12/3/2020,5 star rating,"This local cafe is a gem in the neighborhood. The owners are a mom and son duo with Caribbean roots. Their care and passion shines in the items they serve. The menu features salads, wraps, panini's, hot food, breakfast items, and tons of amazing beverages. I love all the cold drinks including the spiced sorrel and all of the flavored lemonades. The salad is Bomb. It's not just a bowl of greens. It has a mango salsa along with crumbly cheese, nuts (if requested), and tons of yummy fresh fruits like grapes, strawberries, blueberries, and dried cranberries. I had the ham wrap with melty cheese. I also love the saltfish and bakes for breakfast. It's sooo good and comes with sliced avocado.  Yummm! I love supporting local. I love supporting Black owned businesses. And they're also reppin St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Stop in for your morning coffee, a decadent pastries or go with an empty stomach and try their hot foods and sammiches!Check out my Foodie Adventures on @saltandsavor on Insta!"

They carry a modest (wraps, salads, paninis, bake and saltfish) super tasty menu and nice selection of coffees, teas, and cold drinks. If you're there in the morning try the bake and saltfish and add in a matcha infused ginger lemonade or something warm if its chilly. Its covid times so you may not be able to find a seat at its limited capacity but if you can theyve got really comfy chairs and tables to enjoy your meal or get some work done. The music is a mix of soul neo soul and r&b which sets the right vibes to chill or work."

It was before 12 PM in the day so it was pretty quiet (I've heard it can get pretty packed inside). I placed my order with the man behind the counter and I chose to sit in the window at the bar stools. As a child of a Trinidadian, I would have to say that the bake and saltfish was as authentic as they come! Mouth watering good and comes with a side of avocado (zabaca as Trini's would say) and plantain. I also ordered an extra side of plantain, a sorrel and a carrot cake. The female server even warmed up my carrot cake. All of it was delicious and spot on with traditional taste! Decor was beautiful and the atmosphere was calm. Lots of space as well. I even noted that they do serve alcoholic drinks as well.  I would def return to do some work on my laptop as the wifi code was openly available if needed. Only thing I didn't see was a restroom for customers but I also wasn't there for too long. Will return and update the review!"

1556,RQi2YmAkk8g9WdNStAhfbQ,3/27/2014,3 star rating,"I stayed away from this place for the first year or so I worked in the building, under the assumption that an old-fashioned place inside our lobby couldn't be very good. Instead, winter, spring, summer and fall, I wandered around every noon time to gather up pizza, sushi, falafel and sandwiches from up and down Broadway.But I've found out in the past six weeks that Café 11 is a perfectly reasonable lunch destination. The Kosher situation (in deference to the many Orthodox workers on the building's lower floors) means that the menu is a bit limited.  There's no reason to order a sandwich if your tastes don't run towards the tuna, egg and mayo end of the spectrum. The salads have never really had much appeal - they don't chop them here, which is my preferred way of eating these greens. That leaves the surprisingly varied and generally solid sushi. The sushi bar is right behind the counter, and you can see the chefs working with nice pieces of fish. The online ordering system means that I frequently have my rolls ready to go and paid for when coming down from the 18th floor. The two roll special is a somewhat glutinous lunch, but it's more than enough to power through the seven hour afternoon that separates my noonday meal from the evening feast. Whether it's salmon, tuna, fake crab or the strange hybrid combination that is the sushi pizza, this is a dependable lunch option which doesn't require putting on a coat."
1557,RQi2YmAkk8g9WdNStAhfbQ,1/16/2015,4 star rating,"It is possible to be orthodox Jewish and live and eat richly. My friend from work unlocked this new cuisine for me. And I'm always on the lookout for why the girls in my neighborhood have such beautiful skin. Cafe 11 is a kosher take out place with quality, hearty food that has been fresh every time I take out. The Greek salad has a generous, inch wide layer of superlative quality salty, rich feta. The lettuce is fresh and the Greek dressing delicate and flavorful. I do not recommend any other salad. (Other than adding the tuna salad/egg salad on top of the house salad or by themselves because they are perfect. Also the fruit salad which is piled high with fresh fruit.) The avocado melt is warm and substantial tasting, but can be bland without hot sauce. My favorite sushi so far has been the Philadelphia roll which I usually hate, but they turned me around. The cream cheese lends a complex smoky flavor to the fish. The Monster roll is loaded with different types of fish and my friend and I love to get it to celebrate the end of a large presentation. Their yellowtail roll is also high on my list. The bagels are also worth trying, they are fresh each morning. And the danishes are the size of a loaf of bread and very good. As are the muffins, pretty much all the pastries are good and supersized.The internet ordering option is pretty secure and you can pay on delivery. You also don't have to call and I don't have to shout out my greedy order so all my coworkers can hear. Note: they do not do veggie sushi that well. And there are few vegan options that taste as good as stuff with cheese."

Actually, no, I don't get it at all.This place is all about FLAVOR. Say it with me, people: F-L-A-V-O-R. If you order a vegetarian plate of, let's say, spinach, pumpkin, lentils, and rice with a bit of homemade hot sauce on the side... well, you're getting four or five totally distinctive flavors that are all intensely wonderful. The meat dishes are great, too.The portions are generous, and watch out, because you're going to want to finish them. Maybe don't eat breakfast, then come here and gorge yourself - because you're going to want to. I don't really know what happens when they put that big oval plate in front of me, but a few minutes later I'm happy and can barely move. Good thing it's a long walk back to the office.By the way, the service is always friendly - maybe caring is a better word - and the owner has real pride in what she does. I'm guessing the Trinidadian food is what she's proud of most. A lunch for the ages, people. Don't miss it."

We ordered the fries and the Brazilian Sunrise, which was sweet but it didn't blow my mind. It tasted like a run of the mill mimosa tbh. Fries were also alright, nothing special.Service: 3/5Upon entering, we waited a bit to be seated and then once we sat down we were only given 1 small dinner menu. I didn't even known they had drinks at first. We then asked for a drink menu and It was brought. The service was pretty slow, despite it being a pretty small place but our server was nice!Vibe: 4/5The layout of this place is gorgeous! You walk in and you're immediately greeted with a sleek modern style, accented with greenery and floor to ceiling windows. Outside seating should definitely be the go-to if it's a nice day out! Location is convenient because of the ferry but also kind of loud thanks to the FDR but not obnoxiously so.Hole in the Wall was an okay experience for me. The only thing that was on point here was the vibe. It's not unheard of in NYC too pay for the vibe but I was looking forward to some good food & drinks. I really wanted to love this place but I didn't. I think brunch Is their main bread and butter so I might have to try coming back again during brunch for hopefully a different experience."

The room has high ceilings and an industrial feel. It's clean and modern with a nice bar in front. They also have outdoor seating. While you eat you can watch the ferries coming in and out of the terminal. The hostess/server was very sweet. We had avocado toast that was delicious. The chamomile tea bag was unlike anything we've seen before. We need to step up our tea game. The smoothie was delicious. Brekkie. We'll definitely return to try their dinner menu."
1577,nBoOm-TAhRvbcDkHfKOwGg,9/2/2021,4 star rating,"Hole in the Wall Cafe is an eponymously named cafe for its niche American cuisine. We've come here multiple times and it's become our default place to go to if we just need to get out of the apartment. The staff members are super nice here, and we appreciate how lax they are.On our first time here, I ended up ordering some waffles with a berry compote and whipped cream on the side. The waffles were seemingly small, but they were more filling than I expected! They tasted of sweet cinnamon and reminded me of the waffles I would buy from Jamba Juice in college - only with a more refined taste. The berries were quite sweet and fresh, with which I was so relieved, as sometimes berries can get quite tart and sour. The whipped cream was a light and airy complement to the compote and waffles combined. I loved this sense of nostalgia with a modern twist!When we come here for dinner, my default has been the burger (medium rare)! It comes with bacon, cheese, and other standard burger toppings, but Hole in the Wall just prepares their burgers so deliciously! As hearty as the burger is, it's actually smaller relative to other burgers, so you wouldn't feel the fatiguing meat sweats afterward. Paired with some less salty fries reminiscent of an elevated version of McDonald's fries, this is definitely a great meal to chow down on multiple times! We've also tried the shrimp spaghetti, which isn't my usual pairing, but nonetheless, it was tasty! Something we appreciated was how the shrimp didn't have tails so we didn't have to peel off the tails! It just felt like an extra step done for us.Overall, I can see myself coming back to Hole in the Wall Cafe! I'm thankful it's close by, so I can come in whenever I feel like it! Definitely get the waffles if you're here for breakfast or brunch, and get the burger with fries if you're coming for dinner!"

Located right by the 34th st ferry terminal, hole in the wall has such an amazing view and tons of natural light seeping in through the glass wall. It's so well decorated and very contemporary outside. Perfect for a brunch or an evening cocktail. I've seen people working there many times during the day so it's pretty much an all rounder. The food - although it looks just like your average avocado toast...the kicker was the flavor and toppings. So well made & tasted so fresh. The coffee itself was also made very well. Luckily I don't live too far so I can definitely say I will be coming here more frequently. You should too!"

My wife had the Chili Scrambled eggs which were also delicious, and which the chef made to accommodate her gluten-free preferences.  All-in-all, this restaurant is a winner with its ideal location, serving delicious food quickly, in a welcoming and relaxed atmosphere.  We'll be back!"

Could you ask for anything more?! During the summer months I love to sit outside as well. Its located right outside the American Copper Building so there's fountains and extra benches etc. Food and drink- eggs, toast, and hash browns with a matcha latte is my go to meal. Never disappoints. I've also tried the smoothies, the oatmeal, and the croissant and I always leave happy. Staff- I love the staff! One of the servers is from Australia and calls you ""chickedees"" and asks if your ready for ""brekkie"" and tbh I live for that."

There is a made-to-order korean/asian food counter and a hot food bar with all types of selections.  Lots of snacks and options here, and the prices seem reasonable for manhattan.Q Marquet reminds me of a mom-and-pop Wawa (for  those who haven't been to a Wawa... you are missing out!... make a point to go during your next visit to Jersey).  Q Marquet is everything you want a small bodega to be.  I wish this market was closer to where I live.  Hooray for Q Marqet!"

You would never notice it just walking by because it looks like an average convenience store market, but inside they have a huge variety of food and drink options. You can get everything from a fresh made sandwich, to ramen/stir fry (Good! Fresh!), to sushi and seaweed salad, to hot breakfast foods (I love a hot egg white, cheese, and home fry wrap!). They have a big selection of coffees and teas at all times, and the coffee is fresh is not burnt even at 2am. There is a hot buffet during the day with fresh foods available as well. This store is open 24/7 and the only downside is that they only take cash. They have an ATM though. Summary: Open 24/7, functional, you get can almost any food you want and it won't be bad, but they only take cash."

You can choose from a variety of American/Asian food. The food is pretty fresh. I find the salads to be particularly good. I would though stay away from the roll/gimbop they have at the hot food bar since they put too much rice in it. Next to the food bar, they have a bibimbop station. I would have to try it next time I make a visit. On the walls and shelves are your snacks, canned food, simple grocery items. They carry lots of Asian brand items such as pocky and other kirin snacks. The cashiers are very quick and efficient, so have your wallet out if you don't want to hold up the line. They have no seating area and minimal standing bar area by the window.Oh, they also sell flowers outside."

Carnitas bowl- super OK. Nothing to brag about eating for dinner that day. Street corn- best thing we ate. Horchata- really good. The best thing about this entire experience was Frida on the wall.

My boss introduced me to this place and we shared a large pie and calamari between 3 people which was more than enough. The calamari was delicious and you need to ask them to pair it with the hot marinara sauce (it has a nice kick to it if youre obsessed with spicy like I am). The pizza was really good too but my favorite is the panini. So on my 2nd visit I took my best friend here, and she also fell in love with the panini. The hot sorpressata one with cheese and olives just mixed really well together. It was more like a calzone then a panini but either way this is officially one of my favorite place on the island!"

I thought it was really great but it was more like a salad pie. We ordered take out and it was ready pretty quickly. Everything came out fresh and hot right as we arrived to pick it up.

Now, I'm 57 yrs. and I've certainly had my share of Slices from Brooklyn to Staten Island and other areas that don't pertain to me because if its not from the two Boroughs I mentioned then it's not Pizza anyway. I could add Manhattan, but I honestly haven't eaten enough of it there so its unfair fir me to say one way or another, but I will add it for those who have. I can't seem to find that "" Slice like I had at Sal's on 5th. Ave. & 86th. St ( Bklyn ) when I'd wait for the bus. When you folded it you'd hear the crack of the perfectly cooked crust w/ a slight charred flavor but not burned, not too much cheese, and yes there was some oil that would drip from it which I don't think it was a problem, use an extra napkin but leave some excess Olive oil! It was thin and it was delicious, just like it was at Lenny's on 86th St., Nunzios on Hylan Blvd. S I., Victoria's Pizza S I., Brothers S.I., even Pizza Town in S. I. that was located on New Dorp Lane and it looked like a Circus Tent, they had descent Pizza too. For the most part all if it was similar and maybe because it was for me the  late 1970's up until the mid- 90's, and from then till now I can't find that Perfect "" Sicilian Slice "" anywhere so I've given up. This place dies have really good food, its generous portions, the Hero I bought was one of the best ( Eggplant Parmigian ), it was so big they actually place it on a board before wrapping it up for sturdy  handling and it's a smart idea since I said they're generous with the ingredients, etc. Oh and very good Bread cause thats one of the most important  aspects. Thats all I've eaten in this Establishment and although I enjoyed what I had, I haven't gone back because I can make it better and buy brick oven bread from Pastosa or Royal Crown when I'm in the mood to cook that is. However, I cannot make Pizza but I know what I love and remember about it so if I can't do better and I'm displeased with all these upgraded versions with toppings I can't fathom, no oil drip, no cracking sound from folding the crust, etc. Then that's all I have, is a memory but id still prefer it to the Horrible examples I've been subjected to. All good things come to an end right? So this is my Adeu ( not sure of spelling ) to the Pizza I Loved but will not be Forgotten!"

To be far, I'm more of a red sauce gal.Del Pizzaiolo: my mom and grind enjoyed this the best. I did not try it, not a fan of mushrooms.Garlic and Herb: tasty, similar to the Naso without the spice.

1612,U3Ueh2bHtp3DLjrdc5w5fQ,6/24/2019,5 star rating,"The review you've all been waiting for!  Let's do this.Celebrating my 200th YELP review by sharing my all time favorite pizza place, worthy of a special trip from far away lands (very exquisite pizza).I have been to many a pizzeria.  I was raised on pizza and in my house, takeout chains NOT pizza.  Of the many pies consumed across the country, world even, none hold a candle to my holy grail 'za.  They can try all they want, those other guys.  They can put tacos on pizza, ice cream cones, cheeseburgers even.   Let those guys do that and distract people so there's more tables here.  Pizzeria Giove is my hands down favorite spot for crispy, thin crust flavor packed pizza.What, you ask, Gina, separates Giove from the pack?  Brick oven white pizza with a superior quality of crust and cheese.  These unorthodox white pies have won awards in pizza competitions in Italy, Internationally and the US.  Imported ingredients reign supreme.Crust is allllways crispy on the bottom and thin.  It's magic.  You can watch them make pizza, but don't expect to learn any secrets.  Time honed family recipe, modernized by the sons of well known NY pizza makers.  But that crust. . . It's what pizza dreams are made of.  Crust is always dry (nothing worse than soggy pizza) and when you pick it up + fold it literally snaps in between your finger tips.  It's not quite a cracker crust because when you bite into it there is a chewy element.  Ultimate crust goals.Cheese.  Specially made stracciatella.  Made in house using an unconventional technique this is *the* creamiest most flavorful soft white cheese known to man kind.  It's insane.  The combination of the thin crisp crust and creamiest dreamiest cheese are memorably addictive.  I've asked friends to drive from Jersey City to Staten Island when the craving strikes.Toppings are bursting with flavor.  Always prepared freshly and with high quality raw ingredients.  The usual suspects like pancetta, arugula, Crimini mushrooms are joined by more unusual ones like bresaola, marinated cherry tomatoes and sopresatta.  The specific pies you must order (all white as this is their specialty):1. Variopinta.  The one that started it all.  This white pie beat Bobby Flay, drawing acclaim to Giove.  Thinly sliced zucchini, stracciatella, garlic and herb infused cheese and panchetta.  This one is addictive.2. Re.  What all pizza wants to be when it grows up.  Sopressata, stracciatella, soft garlic, sausage.  Complex, heady and satisfying.3. Parma.  Beneath a cozy blanket of Prosciutto di Parma arugula, creamy shavings of Parmigiano Reggiano + marinated cherry tomatoes are kept cozy.  This is a great summer time option.  No red sauce.Bonus - fried calamari.  These are crisp, lightly battered tender on the inside rings of joy.  In the Marinara sauce that accompanies you can actually taste sun ripened tomatoes and basil.Pro-Tip - I do think the traditional red pizza here is beyond better than any trendy city spot.  You will be shocked at how good it is in fact.  But definitely try a unique white pizza as these far exceed the ordinary.Inside, there are 10-15ish tables so I'd recommend making a reservation.  As for the bar situation, there isn't one but B/W/S are served.  Some decent wine bottles on the list FYI.I have dined with many pizza aficionado friends at this unassuming smallishfamily run Italian restaurant.  All come away raving and proclaiming about Pizza Giove.  Even the most jaded and pizza loving veterans.I'm giving my treasured secret all-time best pizza spot because the world is full of over marketed mediocre pizza.  Come here and I promise you'll look at pizza through a new lens.  Ciao!"

Specify that and then little that I knew its $1 for half a banana! Service sucked he didn't know what price to put in the register! Penny hungry who don't know basic rules of customer service! Do yourself a favor and go to Ave Y Carvel! They are the best!
1615,CmCpvQ_pmNw0WaDUFaAz5g,7/19/2016,4 star rating,I have visited this Carvel several times and each time the service has been friendly and the service quick. The place was clean and this spring they gave out free cones. Carvel is a chain which like Mr Softee ensures a certain quality What's not to like!
1616,CmCpvQ_pmNw0WaDUFaAz5g,3/8/2009,4 star rating,"I like Carvel. I like it a lot. It's right on the corner of my block, and I can get ice cream any time I want (except late at night). Not that I want to necessarily be eating ice cream all the time, but I am glad it's there. They now have ""2-for"" deals almost every day of the week.I like it when they have the no-fat soft ice cream, but sometimes they are out of it. I like the milkshakes, but they are a bit too expensive. I like the sundaes but they are so strict about what toppings you can have, depending on the size. I like the little white plastic holders that the wafer cones come in, because they catch all the sprinkles. The hard ice cream doesn't always look so good. But if you want a soft ice cream cone and don't feel like waiting for Mr. Softee or the Kustard King, this is a good place to go.Upgraded to 4 stars. They're really nice."
1617,CmCpvQ_pmNw0WaDUFaAz5g,3/27/2016,4 star rating,FIrst off they make the ice cream on premise. It tastes night and day from the carvel cake you may buy at a grocery store. Genuinely fresh. Only issue is sometimes the low fact ice cream soft serve does not work. Also the staff though courteous not necessarily the warmest. Not a ton of flavors but the taste by far makes up for that. Plus 5 bucks for a large ice cream with topping And wed. Buy one get one free!
1618,CmCpvQ_pmNw0WaDUFaAz5g,4/21/2013,4 star rating,"This is going to be the world's dorkiest review. But anyone that knows me knows how much I LOVE ICE CREAM! And Carvel hits the spot when you don't think you can follow portion control by allowing yourself to buy a pint from the grocery store. They have junior sized cups which are perfect and the small size is truly huge if you're hungry and splurging. Not too exceptionally expensive either. For a junior cup or cone it's only $2.75. I feel any fro yo place in the city is at least 4 bucks for a small cup and skimpy toppings. There's hard packed ice cream. Personal favs are cookie dough, mint chip and strawberry! Also, soft-serve regular and low-fat. Go there on Wednesdays if you have a buddy around you get 2 for 1. Also, these guys at this particular Carvel pile on the ice cream. They do not short you at all and I freaking love it."

We order the nutella milkshake which clearly shows a chocolate looking milk shake with whip cream and chocolate syrup. What we got was two milk shakes that looked 100% vanilla. She put little to no nutella. Also, SHE TRIED TO CHARGE US 50 CENTS EACH FOR WHIP CREAM!!!. I was shocked. The picture and what we received didn't resemble each other AT ALL! and the nerve to try and charge extra for whip cream when it was not told or written anywhere. She clearly just was trying to make extra money by skimping on the nutella and charging extra for whip cream. Taking advantage of Carvel. Such a disappointment. DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!! PLUS, the place looked a bit on the dirty side."

I started with the Blue Point Long Island oysters.  They were about as fresh as can be.There starters were nice. What troubled me:I'm sorry, filet mig did not taste like a $65 steak.  I make a better FM.  The side dishes are nicely cooked, yet the servings are smaller than I expected for a steakhouse I asked the waitstaff which ranch produced the steak - I was blown off.  It is a common question and deserves an answer.At the end of the day, yes, a good American steak house but left me less than awe stuck."

I had the filet mignon and a baked potato. While they were superb, maybe I'm just not a high class guy. I can't say I see the value here. We spent about 300 for the evening when I could have gotten something just slightly less quality at an Ale House. Im not saying ale house is better, I personally just can't justify the price."

The charred beef was grilled to perfection and was worth every penny of the $60 pricetag. My fiancee ordered the filet and we ate every bite with a bottle of the Frank Family Cabernet. High quality beef, exquisite preparation, great venue.  This classic steakhouse is decorated with old world charm. The staff knows their business and we were never waiting or wondering when a critical component to our meal would arrive. Perfect execution from the host to the table to the meal and, unlike Big Paulie, we'll be back to enjoy the venue in the future."
1631,NcC0_r4cbkAw6MxPe4uUcg,6/6/2021,4 star rating,"If you're looking for trendy vibes and food crafted from newly discovered ""fusion"" ingredients maybe avoid this place. But for what it offers - steakhouse classics served up by polite old school gentlemen in a classically decorated venue - Sparks Steak House does it very well indeed. We stopped by on a hot summer evening, warmly greeted and shown to a large table against the wall (my favorite location, ya never know lol). No fancy cocktail list but my gin & tonic was refreshing and well priced @ $13.95 for NYC so of course I got a second round. They have an extensive wine list as well. Bread basket was pretty good and quickly replenished after hubbie devoured it. Shared the burrata app to start, a nice portion but the burrata wasn't creamy, actually on the firm side so wouldn't get that again. Things picked up with my entree, two broiled lobster tails and several mega-shrimp served in a hot butter bath. Excellent taste and generous size. Hubbie usually gets a ribeye cut but Sparks doesn't offer that so he chose their signature sirloin which was flavorful and tender, also a huge thick portion with plenty to take home. The gigantic delicious mushroom caps were our favorite side with crispy hash browns running a close second. Would definitely recommend the tartufo dessert, delicious cold creaminess attractively presented in quarters surrounding a mound of fresh whipped cream. Pecan walnut pie was a small serving and overly sweet for my tastes, also served with homemade whipped cream. A satisfying end to an enjoyable evening."
1632,NcC0_r4cbkAw6MxPe4uUcg,1/22/2023,5 star rating,"Truly an outstanding experience. I really could not find fault with anything. My wife and I spent my 40th birthday here. We ordered a feast wanting to try everything. We had the Scottish salmon and baked claims for an appetizer. I had the filet for dinner and she had the sliced steak with sautéed onions and peppers. We ordered a side of Roquefort cheese. Every single dish was perfection. I literally can't find fault. The presentation was nice, our server Hector was as professional as they come. They had an outstanding wine selection. We throughly enjoyed our vintage bottle of Bordeaux. The happy birthday chocolate mousse and ice cream/fruit plate was amazing. Even the pieces of fruit and berries were perfection, it is almost as if the chef goes out and hand picks his fruits. Their port wine list is as impressive as their wine selection. I have been to many steak houses around the world, everything from independents to the big chains. Sparks out does all of them!"

We went here for dinner the first night we were in New York and it was the best meal we had in the city! My fiancé had been here before, so told us about the history of the place, too. It's a really cool old school steak house that feels like a classic New York dinner spot.We tried a few appetizers and they were all delicious, but the show stoppers were the steak and wines. I ordered the filet mignon, which was FANTASTIC. Perfectly cooked and also the BIGGEST filet I've ever seen! I could only eat half of it! They also have the most amazing wine list. We order a couple bottles of older Bordeaux, which were exquisite. I really enjoyed the entire evening. Service was superb and our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu and wine list. The ambiance and decor was very classic and cozy, too.If you're looking for a classic, old school restaurant with fantastic food this is the place for you. We came here with a group, but it would also be a great spot for a date. Cheers!"
1634,NcC0_r4cbkAw6MxPe4uUcg,11/16/2021,4 star rating,"I came to Sparks for the special event by RESY. It was a special meal for $125 per person that was a collaboration with Danny Meyer who happened to be dining at the restaurant when I was there! Upon arrival we got there a little bit before our reservation but we seated right away. Once we get down we were not attended you for a little while I guess because we didn't need a menu. The server didn't ask if we wanted water so I requested for water. The server also did not ask if we wanted drinks and did not inform us about any wine pairings. So, I went ahead and ordered the choice of wine that was by the glass which they had about one of each. I had the Pinot noir it which was very light and smooth. I'm not sure how much wine cost but it must be close to $20 each based on the bill. Service was not great but that's just because of the times.The meal began with three appetizers including sautéed shrimp, jumbo lump crab meat, and six baked clams. My partner only eats the clams so we were hoping he could get some replacement but the server was confused. After the appetizers, was the main course. Dinner was a huge sirloin steak, two bowls of cream spinach, hashbrowns and mushroom caps. The server was also particular about only giving us one portion of potato. Dessert came out at a very appropriately time, and he came with the three desserts were pecan pie, facets double chocolate chip ice cream, and cheesecake. Every dessert was delicious but the pecan pie definitely topped the cake (accidental pun not intended). I had spoken to the server when we began to please put a candle in my husbands dessert and he forgot. When I mentioned that they came out and bought a fourth dessert with a candle in it!The food was amazing, and portions huge. It was really reasonable for the price, and we both came home with half of our steaks and the sides. I think the server felt guilty and gave us another batch of potatoes since it looked like everyone else got two.I had pre-paid the 125 per person which included tax and so our bill only came to about $40. I'm proud of myself for remembering to tip on the original bill price!I would definitely recommend a venue and I happened to be very lucky that this was the night that Danny decided to dine with his family. I think the promo that I did was totally worth it because you got a lot of food and we definitely had enough for another meal afterwards.I would come back to Sparks because I think that the food was great and reasonably priced. Service left much to be desired but I believe everyone is doing their best during this difficult time."

Server was a little rude, menus states a sirloin ( to me that's well a sirloin) so I asked if they had any other cuts ex..... new your strip which is what I wanted, rib-eye, t-bone ..... server said if that's what I'm looking for I need to go down the street. I was kind of in shock then he proceeded to say we don't sell fatty steaks only the sirloin has fat on one side. I said Sr "" then that's a NY strip not a sirloin!!!!"" They insist it's a sirloin for the sake of not arguing I ordered it and it was what I wanted and cook to perfection."

We payed $48 for 3 items & they not only tasted NOTHING like thai food, but their customer service was horrendous. No wonder their restaurant is always empty."

My friend and I were craving Thai food and this one of the halal places I found which I heard good things about. But personally, I did not have an enjoyable experience with their customer service. First, the food was good. I got the sizzling chicken and the portion was quite generous and the spice level was good. The food was savory and fresh, overall a satisfying way to break the day's fast. The place is relatively small but it wasn't busy so we were seated very quickly. The server initially approached us twice to ask about the order but we were trying to decide. But eventually, the food took nearly 25 mins to come out. Afterwards, we needed something and we couldn't find out waitress for the longest time. It was really frustrating to wait around to get another jug of water. In addition, after finally receiving the check we waited another 10mins because the waitress was on the phone and did not even bother to look up at us to let us know to hold on or anything. If you have time to wait around then I would go there because the food was definitely good but I don't think it's the best thai food I've had."

Waiter forgot about the drink order which made it out right in time for dinner. Lollipop chicken wings:  the wings are not lollipop and a bit on the salty side.  Tavern Burger: requested the burger to have no bacon and no ketchup (that's their secret sauce) but they were unable to execute.  They corrected it by removing the bacon (despite feedback given about religion), scraped off the ketchup and added additional cheese. The burger was taken off the bill because it was just not edible with that amount of cheese.  However, the frites was good. Aged Strip steak:  drowned in steak sauce to compensate the strip was heavy with fatty pieces.  Veggies and mash was excellent. Ambience: beautiful 10/10. They nailed the high end cabin look."

I wanted to grab a drink and dinner, but I did not realize all of the drinks were Soju based so I opted out just because I wasn't in the mood to try anything new. I Ordered a burger which was pretty basic and in my opinion not worth 20 bucks but it did the job, it wasn't bad. It comes with these tiny pickles and onions. While I'm not a fan of pickles they were super cute and I had to give it a taste. I love the decor inside and it looks like a great spot for a date."

I couldn't tell what cuisine the restaurant specialized in. Never in my life have I seen burrata served with guacamole. The service was impeccable. The gentleman who was also the bartender was very meticulous and attentive. The ambiance was very cool! I loved the decor. Very kitschy. It was ice cold in there, so bring a sweater. In all, I wouldn't go back for the food. I didn't try the beverages so I couldn't tell you how the drinks are."

It was smack in the middle of the week and it was VERY quiet.  After I had my vax card checked, I joined a table toward the back with my friends.  One of the happy hour deals was the sangria.  Red in the winter for me!  It was sooo tasty, not too sweet.  The presentation was great too!  As I sipped my sangria, I gazed at the decor.  The place is pretty interesting with framed paintings (even some empty frames) on the ceiling.  The lighting was dim which set a cool vibe as well.  We were all doing dinner separately, but we all wanted to nosh on something.  We decided to do a meat and cheese board.  It was a bit on the generic side, but still good nonetheless.  When you put a fig spread on a meat and cheese board, you've got my vote.  Definitely looking to come back and try a food meal and even more of their drinks. You can tell that this spot gets a cool crowd!"

Only 2 servers on hand plus a tropical storm happening outside, maybe service would have been different if they had an influx of regular customers as the shower was happening. But still, the staff was very nice and accommodating. Only a couple of things I was meh about. Their lollipop chicken drumlette app was just ok. I was told that in the past it came with a cauliflower mash of sort but our server said they discontinued that. There was no dipping sauce or anything to accompany it nor veggie wise either. Plus the lollipops weren't squished down enough to resemble said lollipop. But I digress...Hope to be back here again soon."

I made a delivery on Grub Hub at around 10:30pm they said my food would come at 11:15 pm so I waited. At 11:30 they still had not arrived so I had to contact the restaurant to ask where my food was, they then proceeded to inform me he was on his way he would arrive whenever  he came. My order FINALLY came A HOUR AND A HALF LATER considering I ordered their easiest dish (Tandoori Chicken) and a chicken soup & I only live about 10 minutes from them. Anyways, when my food finally comes, my Entire Chicken soup was spilled into the plastic bag. I immediately called the restaurant and they then told me it was my fault that there was nothing they could do about it. I understand that accidents do happen but I am a paying customer. After that, I was then transferred to the boss who was also rude and spoke with a lot of disrespect. The boss put the Delivery Driver on the phone and the boss coerced the Delivery Driver inform me that my order was intact when it was delivered. it clearly was not and then the boss hung up the phone on me stating that he was not going to do anything to rectify the situation. He stated the restaurant was closed so there was nothing he can do, I stated that it clearly was not closed due to them just sending out my food. This establishment is a joke and filled with rude and disrespectful employees that would be astonished to have half a brain cell. WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE EVER!"

We decided we wanted some good Indian food. After looking at reviews we found Tandoori Hut. And it was some of the best food I have ever had.

So we decided to try some desi food. We were roaming around the corners and went to this place. It was small though but not busy. We both were hungry now. Quickly scanned the menu and decided to order a plate of samosa chaat, kadhai paneer and tandoori roti. We get served quickly. So coming to the taste now, the samosas were yummy, as it was chaat item so it was served with chole, yogurt and some chutneys. Then comes the kadhai paneer, it was mouthwatering. The curry was reddish brown and it was looking so delicious already and to my surprise I got the exact taste as I used to have in India. Same spices, same style and paneer pieces were soft and chewy. Ambience was okay, some party was going so it was too louder, but understandable. The color shade to the restaurant was dull. Price was normal. Will visit for Indian curries soon. Keep up the good work. Thank you!"

The tea is strong so you taste the flavors and I absolutely love this. What is even better is that the price is cheaper compared to other brands.

We won't be going again sadly."

1719,GlPJPpKvPR4d8dmcSEYpdA,6/12/2016,5 star rating,Amazing food and great value for money. Portions are large and food is authentic greek. They prepare it themselves instead of warming up mass produced rest. Depot food. A+

Went in, sat on one of their stools and ordered a gyro sandwich.  My friend orders a cheese burger.  The food was average, I felt like the gyro meat was waay too dry.   Being curious about the price, I asked the girl behind the counter about the lamb over rice. She told me it was 11 dollars.  I much rather drive to the city and pick up the famous 53rd and 6th halal guys than to conveniently order from them.  And like Lea wrote, the restaurant is a little run down. The food is average at most, the only thing I find worth it to come back for their average over priced food is the attractive girl behind the counter.  I've definitely experienced better before. 2/5"
1723,GlPJPpKvPR4d8dmcSEYpdA,2/6/2015,5 star rating,The best Greek Souvlaki in New York. The most foodgasmic meal I've had in a really long time! We had Tzatziki with warm pita which was crack. The food knocked us all off our feet. I know it's a simple meal but execution was exceptional.
1724,GlPJPpKvPR4d8dmcSEYpdA,1/19/2015,4 star rating,I eat from  this establishment about 2 or 3 times a week because it's right next to my work and I usually stop their before my shift I been coming here for years the food is above average very large portions at decent prices I usually get the chicken greek salad  it comes with a whole pita for $10.50 which is a bargain for the size of salad I also order it with lamb gyro on top which is truly amazing but try not to get it that much because the gyro meat isn't that waist friendly this is not a place to go for ambience but to get some greek comfort food to go this is the best in this part of astoria
1725,GlPJPpKvPR4d8dmcSEYpdA,1/2/2011,2 star rating,"This is a mediocre-at-best neighborhood gyro place that's incredibly rundown and filthy. It's been around for years and I used to order gyro platters often from here, but stopped for a long time.Recently, I ordered from here and noticed that they have a ""C"" rating from the health department. For those who don't know, any establishment that doesn't get an A the first time around gets a second chance to get reviewed at a later date. Then, whatever grade they get on the second time is the final score. Two shots and still a C (aka one step above failing)? Once you walk in the place, you can begin to understand why. The food handling and cooking equipment storage is highly questionable. Overall, the place just looks dirty.In terms of food, the gyro platters are $11 and not outstanding. You get a good amount of meat over yellow rice, a salad, and some pita bread. I'd suggest going elsewhere for meal unless you're literally starving."
1726,GlPJPpKvPR4d8dmcSEYpdA,5/2/2014,3 star rating,The souvlaki sandwich was pretty good. The face needs a makeover but the food is ok. It seems family owned this place can become a 5 star place with just a face lift.  The authenticity of Greek food is there.

Basically, when it really comes down to it, the food here is not bad. It's certainly isn't McDonalds or BK quality, but it is a chain resturant and calling it Mexican is a little far fetched. If anything....it's more like a WHITE LIE, and when I was a kid, I was always taught that even a white lie is not acceptable!!!One thing though that I really like about Chipotle is that the food is always fresh and it's ORGANIC (oink oink, moo moo, chirp, chirp, hee hee) Its also quick and waiting is a breeze.

Didn't skimp on the other toppings, either.Lots of extra Tabasco sauce. Out of limes though, AND cilantro rice. Bummer! I went about an hour and a half before closing though.Line was long but moved fast. Ample seating. Beer.

I walked in 1 minute after they had opened (10:46, I made sure before walking in) and two staff members told me they were closed. I asked when they would be open and they checked their phones and said oh I guess now, but what got me was that they started talking about me in Spanish and saying how annoying people like me are. However the rest of the staff was otherwise friendly."

Their stuff were about to run out and they don't even bother to swap or add a new batch on. Instead they just give less portion to each costumer. I would give this location more star if their portion size was better or similar to all other chipotle I've been to. The person at the register doesn't seem to care and rushed the payments like they just trying finish it fast without asking any other questions of what else I would need."
1733,GlPJPpKvPR4d8dmcSEYpdA,9/18/2019,3 star rating,Free WiFi. They charged me for extra steak but i didn't consider it extra because she tosses 5 pieces in to begin with. I've been here quite some time having lunch and I can't say I've seen the dirtiness but I have seen someone come by and wipe the tables off. 3 stars for the servers tone but the cashier she was pretty friendly.

My server gave me maybe 7.5 pieces of steak in my entire burrito. Mind you, i only came in here so that I could use the restroom. So sad I had to overpay for a tortilla and beans with a dash of steak, all to just use the restroom. Whatever. First and last time here. And this is why America is falling."

And they have the best sweet iced tea EVER!!!!! I hope they never change the recipe, so good! They need to show other McDonald's how to make it this good!"

Ordered a caramel frappe, large fries, egg biscuit, and fudge sundae (which they didn't have because they were already cleaning the machine before 9PM). Got home to find that they filled the LARGE fries less than halfway (super salty, too) and burnt the biscuit, which I wasn't able to eat because it was hard! Do not waste your time coming here!"

But yesterday I woke up with the crazy craving for an egg and cheese on a biscuit from McDonald's.  And let me just this tell you how delicious it was after not having McDonald's for a couple of years.. I went to the  Drive-through so I didn't get to see the inside but the drive-through went fairly quickly it was also able to get my food fairly quickly.
1741,xR2Yeb_Nh0MOAiUIaqaVOg,7/5/2020,1 star rating,"There's really only one real reason to leave a review for a fast food chain; the service. The food quality being drastically different from one location to another is rare but the service, that's a different story. And the title of this story of this location is ""Zero Stars if Possible"". And I'm not one to leave a scathing review just based on one experience. After all, anyone can come on an off day.So my first experience there, the classic. Forget an item from my order. Order 2 meals and one of the sandwich wasn't there. One of the sandwiches!! But who hasn't had an experience like that. Lesson learned: check you bag.My second experience, in a way it's my fault. Ordered the breakfast platter among other items.Checked that the item was there so thought I was good to go. But before driving off, I asked the server if they put the syrup in since I didn't want to rummage through the bag. The server confidently said yes but of course, no syrup to be found. Kind of tough to choke down the hot cakes without the syrup.And finally my third and my last visit, I ordered through the app and when I got there and checked in I went to the counter to pick up my order. I told them my order number but it wasn't showing up in there system. Okay, it can happen. But when I tried to ask and figure out what was happening, the server was just staring at me with a blank face. Literally just stared at me without saying anything. So I asked again, and she just relied ""it's not on the screen."" So I tried again to discuss with her how to resolve the issue but again she just stared at me with a blank face. After a full minute of us just staring at each other, I just left because I thought maybe something was wrong with her.So just wanted to do the right thing and give people the heads up about the possible experience they can face at this location. Also, the sequel to this story is ""Never Going Back Here Again""."

Although it was rainy !The bar was a big draw as it was located in the middle and I loved the seating all around. Seemed fully stocked with lots I'd never seen before. They have a great menu for cocktails, lots of wine and beer too. Interesting food menu too, but we didn't eat.I had a really good drink though, the Victoria cross, empress gin, my favorite, Mediterranean tonic, grapefruit juice, and lavender. Little spiced floral cocktail, certainly one of the prettiest! Delicious too. Rosè wine had a thumbs up too. Great bartenders, kinda goofy and fun! I like that the bar was separated from main dining area, but close by, nice layout. Just what we needed to keep us shopping more! Loved the bar."

We ordered 1 Queensburger, 1 Queens Full Breakfast and a Skate Katsu. Honestly, the view and ambiance of the place are the only ones worth coming for but the price for this average to below-average food was not worth it. The waitresses were also snobbish to me and my guests (we just asked for the menu and to take a pic of us). Service: 5/10Ambiance: 7/10Food: 2/10"

Place was buzzing, but not so loud that you couldn't have a conversation.Lighting was a smidge too dim, but we were still able to see each other.Casual and cozy.

1752,RdcqVP_xjxQEbNRMYccBQw,1/27/2023,4 star rating,"3.5 stars for food... 5 for service and ambience. We were seated right by the window overlooking the vessel and loved the view and vibe of the place. The cocktails were beautiful looking, which like many things at Hudson Yards, is all about paying for presentation... and not actually tasting anything truly unique (since many of these cocktail mixtures can be found at plenty of other NY bars). As for the meal, I really enjoyed it, but I can't say I'm yearning to have any dish again, except perhaps the filet mignon. That was perfectly cooked and paired with a nicely textured potato gratin. Oysters and burrata were fine, but not super memorable. The roasted duck tasted lovely, but it was a tad chewy; it had a really nice currant sauce, but there was another sauce on the plate that I couldn't quite figure out and didn't seem to belong. Loved our super friendly and accommodating waiter though -- for checking in on us and following our resy requests. If  there is one reason for us to return it would honestly be for him."

I made a reservation here last night for what I thought I was going to be a good date night and the whole experience was a bust.The ambiance is great, the view of the vessel is awesome and the decor is very nice. Outside of that, our waitress was extremely unpleasant, rude and the service was horrible.We ordered a porterhouse for 2 and it was the worst steak I ever had. We ordered it medium and it came out well done. We decided to keep it because we waited quite some time for our food. The steak was over cooked and dry. The Brussels sprouts were hard and bland. Our Mac and cheese with waygu ox tail came out cold and so did the hard and cold potatoes au gratin. We politely and apologetically asked the waitress to replace both sides and she wasn't thrilled. The only thing I could say that was good about our experience was the bread and butter from the starters menu. $300 dinner and left unsatisfied and hungry! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. I blame myself for not checking with my yelp community first before coming here."
1754,RdcqVP_xjxQEbNRMYccBQw,12/30/2022,3 star rating,"I booked a reservation on the Wednesday after Christmas for a celebratory end of the year lunch with 5 of my greatest friends of the past 25 plus years. We were excited to see the lovely decor and view at Queensyard  based on all the social media posts we'd seen. The restaurant was no longer nicely decorated as it had been (looked nothing like the social media posts.). It's was lovely nonetheless. When our full party arrived we were promptly seated at a large bench area. The bench was comfortable, until it moved. I quickly realized two benches were placed together and the seating was arranged so I was sitting where the two benches connected. The benches slid apart every time someone rose from the table to use the restroom. I was absolutely uncomfortable but managed to squeeze myself over so that I was no longer straddling the two benches. Poor seating arrangement. We ordered our meals. Mostly salads and a main. I personally ordered the truffle Caesar salad with shrimp and the mushroom risotto. After what seemed like an eternity, the salads arrived. Unfortunately, my salad was served with salmon instead of shrimp. I corrected my order and waited another eternity for my replacement salad. At the point my replacement salad finally arrived, the rest of my party was ready for their mains. I felt rushed to finish my salad to catch up. In the midst of scarfing down my salad, a fire alarm went off. It certainly made us all feel like we were right back in high school with the fire alarm going off at the least opportune moment!  Fortunately it was a false alarm. Our mains arrived and we enjoyed our meals. Fair warning, this is a place for a very leisurely meal. Service is quite slow. Do not make plans immediately afterwards or you are guaranteed to run late. My friends and I made the best of our experience here. The mishaps made it quite a memorable lunch for all the wrong reasons. I really wanted to love this place. Unfortunately, I do not see a return here in our future for any one of us."

I mean our waiter was attentive the staff was so nice and we were treated like two princesses. The ambiance was just right!!!! We had a full course meal. We started with Rose and ended with this amazing desert. I had such a great time. It was my first time coming to Hudson yards and I definitely will be back because the mall was absolutely beautiful. The restaurant also had amazing views and the decor was just soooo pretty!!! Picture perfect. I came straight from work so I didn't get a chance to change so next time I will be dressed for the occasion!!! I booked my reservation on open table.
1756,RdcqVP_xjxQEbNRMYccBQw,7/24/2022,3 star rating,"So this place has been on my radar since it's has opened, the idea of having access to British food here in NYC made me happy, so now that so finally had some time I decided to pay it a visit. From the moment you walk in you're greeted and seated, the ambiance is beautiful, open space, glass panels where you can have a great view of the vessel and the shed, the seating are more pub/parlor like super comfortable and cushioned. Huge painted murals on the wall, shrubbery in between the floor plan seating. I guess with the name queens yard my expectations was traditional British food on the menu and that was not the case with exception of fish and chips. I had the prawn cocktail, corn elote and the tomato Rigatoni, the prawns were bland and a little hard the chew, I was expecting the Elote to be the typical Mexican street corn but instead it was corn kernels cooked on some type of gravy, which left a weird after taste, I truly enjoyed the Tomato Rigatoni. Overall it's a 5/10 for me, as beautiful as the space was I didn't enjoy the food. I went around lunch time so the menu was limited and I am not one to close the door on a place after one try, so I'll definitely visit again during dinner hours and hopefully I have a different experience."

The seaweed salad was soaked in a unpleasant overpowering dressing that's usually just a footnote with others so the sesame flavor could shine. Then came the shumai which was drenched in sauce and lacking in shrimp flavor. The bun. The bun, it was nicely moist however the chicken wasn't crispy and resembled more of a chicken nugget texture/flavor.

The meat and bun were both perfectly cooked and flavored -- enticing one's taste buds to order seconds.  Next, we ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen and Shoyu Ramen. The pork belly was delightful and cooked to perfection. The broth in both dishes was first place in my coast to coast journey in hunting for the best ramen. They treat their dishes like art and it shows. The couple sitting next to us ordered a rice dish and vegetarian ramen and said they were amazing. The service is outstanding here.

I ordered through Seamless and paid ahead and the order was ready right at the time of pick up! Food: I ordered the chicken tacos with mild salsa. The meal comes with 3 tacos and is very filling for lunch that I had leftovers for another meal. The tacos have a good flavoring stuffed with corn, rice, cheese, and salsa. They give you a side of sour cream and green salsa which I highly suggest to add onto your tacos! Can't wait to try something else on their menu."

It didn't have much cheese on it but the chicken had good flavor and the serving size was really big. My sister had the barbacoa chicken tacos. They had great flavor and the tortillas were soft and warm. We also ordered cheese dip with our meals. When it was brought to us, it was canned cold cheese, so I asked for something else. They kindly brought us guacamole instead and it was very good with good flavor.  The only thing that really brought the rating of this place down was the chips. The chips were stale and hard to eat. The prices were good here as well. In a pinch, this place is good but not something I would seek out. However, my sister said that her meal is something she would definitely like to have again."

Take your money somewhere else because they are arrogant and have no sense of customer service. My company organized a Cinco De Mayo lunch from here and we were getting the food catered by El Toro. The food was scheduled to arrived at 12:30pm and at 1:30 they still haven't arrived. We were put on hold and passed around when we were calling asking for the food and no one could answer us. They just kept saying the holiday was causing a delay, but isn't that why we scheduled catering ahead of time so they can plan it out properly? When the food finally arrived after 2pm, we went down to meet the delivery guy and we told him to call his manager because he obviously should be able to get ahold of him. When we spoke to the manager all he said was ""We've had enough business today. We don't need yours"" and he told the delivery guy not to give us the food and we won't have to pay. I'm sorry, but that is NOT good service. Everyone in the office was waiting for the food that was over an hour late and they refused to accommodate us with any type of discount for the inconvenience. How arrogant can they be to say that had enough business and they don't need ours? This place disgusts me for their cheap food, they can't, at the very least, provide good customer service. My company made a quick large group order at chipotle and we were all satisfied with our own custom burritos and burrito bowls and Margaritas on Cinco de Mayo."

The worst part is watching them inhale everything as you are likely to gain weight by smelling this stuff alone. What should you order? That shouldn't even be a question on your mind - ""Roast beef and muzz"" with or without onions and ask for the gravy on the side. Dipping the entire sandwich into the bowl of gravy after every bite is almost mandatory, so now isn't the time to watch the calories.- Potato Croquettes, even when eating like a gavone you need an appetizer and of course this gets dipped in the gravy as well!- Fried Ravioli, and in case you're with some friends share these...Realistically, for $10 bucks you can eat better than royalty. Add a buck to that for a big Arizona iced tea. And maybe add a few bucks to that for the tip in case you choose to get it delivered, if your going to eat like a an obese person may as well be lazy like some of them... *Sidenote: not the same owner as the other Johns Deli that opened in Staten Island's New Dorp area, however both are somehow connected to the original one in Brooklyn*"

The options for ordering a roasting beef sandwich are in roll or hero form - I opted for the roll.  I don't believe you have much options for the sandwich but it comes with onions and fresh mozzarella and then they put the sandwich back in the oven to melt the cheese.  The final topping and probably the most important ingredient is the sauce they put on in the end. When you look at the sauce in the pan and the guy behind the counter scooping it up, it really looks like tar or a pot of italian coffee..... What to expect when eating the sandwich - the meat is tender, the taste is flavorful and the sauce is awesome....   You gotta try this place!

I came here for a small quick dinner last night with my mom. We ordered beef empanadas and the pollo al ajillo to share. The beef empanadas were pretty tasty (especially with their hot green sauce), however, the pollo al ajillo was not good at all. The menu said chicken breast in garlic sauce, but the sauce was more like Campbell's cream of chicken soup. It barely tasted like garlic, and there were even several little lumps of flour in the sauce (which I initially thought was roasted garlic, but realized it wasn't after eating one!) It was similar to what you see when you're just starting to cook a can of soup. We could not finish it after that. Also, the chicken was cut up into thin bite size pieces, so it's not a whole boneless chicken breast, as you would normally see in a pollo al ajillo. As soon as we were done, we wanted to just pay the bill and go, but unfortunately our waiter was no where to be seen for a good 15-min. We even tried to catch another waitress' attention, but i don't think she heard us, as she was busy attending to her own tables. Finally, when our waiter came, he gave us the check and just took our plates right away. There was no ""how was your meal?"" or ""Can i get you a box to wrap up your food?"" since I'm sure he could clearly see the pollo al ajillo was barely touched. Perhaps they were short staffed at that time, which I can understand, but even an apology for not checking on us for that long would have been nice."

Both chicken and beef empanadas were good; my friends vouched for the sausage because I don't eat pork. My regular order of roasted chicken and rice with beans we're delicious. My friends couldn't stop raving about the pernil. The only dish not enjoyed by our table was the garlic shrimp. What really is the icing on these savory dishes I'd the green sauce.

The garlic fried rice could have used more garlic, but this dish was just outstanding and another MUST HAVE!!Green market veggies (in green curry) - another great dish to balance out all the meat we had.  Veggies were perfectly cooked with a delicious curry sauce.The Chef was excited to see what we would order for dessert, but alas, after all that delicious food, we were all too full and had no room for dessert.  Note to self: next time, order less food to leave room for dessert! hahaha  Purple Yam has a huge menu!  I'm looking forward to exploring their many other menu items and to more of their Chicken Adobo and Tocino (my fav).  Highly recommended, and we will be back!  :)"

However, the adobo wasn't what I expected but I appreciated the flavor of its own since there are many ways to make filipino style adobo. I guess in my dish, it was more on the ""vinegar"" side but I can't really complain because it was good regardless.

Came here on a Saturday at 1pm for brunch, he ordered the chicken adobo and I ordered the deep fried pork dish (lechon kawali) with garlic fried rice.His 3 pieces of chicken were tender, succulent, and with the sauce/gravy, was extremely flavorful. My pieces of pork chunks were juicy and also flavorful, came with a spicy type of soy sauce and a cabbage & sliced carrots garnish that complimented the dish really well. I appreciated that despite the pork being fried, it wasn't greasy, and the portions were extremely generous. The garlic in the rice was subtle, still an excellent side option for our plates. As per my friend, reminded him of his childhood, truly authentic flavorful dishes.I'm addition to the extraordinary food, we were impressed with the waiter/host who was a one-man show managing all the tables (place was packed by 2pm), and was attentive all the way through the dining experience.

We ordered the Lechon Kawali, Goat Curry, Sisig, Chicken Adobo, Eggplant Kulawo and Green Market Veggies in Curry. Lechon Kawali - HUGE portion and for $21, you get what you're paying for. There was a generous amount of pork belly to share with the whole table and for me to take home. It was perfectly crispy and fattyGoat Curry - flavorful but a tiny portion which came with 3 wraps.Sisig - It was missing the egg on top but otherwise pretty flavorful, chewy and slightly tangy/sour. Easily my second favorite dish of the nightChicken Adobo - generous portion of chicken cooked well but the sauce tasted too sour (despite supposedly having coconut milk)Eggplant Kulawo - easily the worst dish of the night. There's a reason there aren't many photos of it on Yelp and that's because it was basically inedible. It was a roasted eggplant with some cherry tomatoes and mangoes sitting in a puddle of coconut milk. It tasted charred, had no seasoning and the worst part was that it was COLD. This dish looks like it should be served warm but left an icy taste in my mouthGreen Market Veggies - also a disappointment unfortunately. There's nothing special about them, just steamed vegetables in a coconut milk/broth that wasn't worth the $14 price tag. The server was nice enough to take it back and remove it from our bill after my friend said she wasn't happy with itWhile Purple Yam evokes a cozy atmosphere, its food misses the mark by a longshot. We also asked them to put some ice cream we had with us in the freezer while we were dining and when we got it back at the end of the night it had fully melted"

What deterred me from ten full was the 3 star review, but my roommate and my friends swear by ten full, so I tried it.I ordered crab Rangoon, eggplant with garlic sauce, and tofu with broccoli. All were delicious and it's an added bonus that you can use your credit card.  The service was fast and friendly. Crab Rangoon was much better than china gardens. What my peers like about ten full is they say it is lighter than most places and the ingredients seem fresher.The sauce was lighter which is great!  Bc more places use too much sugar or salt. Ingredients seemed fresh as well.I will return!"

Food that stands out include the fried chicken (so, so delicious), their house BBQ ribs (for the most part, executed really well), and I really do like their shrimp dishes, particularly their shrimp with garlic sauce and broccoli. Their vegetable dishes could use improvement with more variety of veggies. But overall, the food is solid, the service is fast, the prices are really great. Good place to order from!"
1821,uoYjk2KD79Zrbzx_dHQdqQ,1/29/2012,4 star rating,"Passing by, one wouldn't see it as a great Chinese takeout. That's because it's not great, the food is slightly above average. But inside the dining tables are clean, the kitchen is clean and the food is tasty enough. Been here dozens of times in the past years by myself and with friends. Dining in only has about 4 or 5 tables and their delivery is good. The people taking your order either over the phone or at the counter are nice and can be spoken with clearly enough.I'm going to mention a few orders and how they taste.The texture of the rice like the pork fried rice is decent because it's not too soft and not hard to swallow, it's a good medium texture. The eggrolls we often try are often crispy but not crunchy crispy, eggrolls only have a light crunch factor. The inside of the eggrolls are good, right amount of salt, flavorful over all taste, the airiness of the cabbage mixture inside is right. The eggrolls often are served fresh and not over fried.The rib tips aren't overly chewy, but they are chewy. They are filling and meaty. I thought the Buffalo Wings were okay, the flavor wasn't extraordinary, very light and light crisp. The chicken wings didn't come out too great either. They are average in flavor and crisp, nothing to rave about. The General Tso's Chicken and curry dishes are also average, tasty but slightly over done with the sauce and mediocre on flavor.The Fish w/Garlic Sauce on their Lunch Special is pretty good and the most recent dish I just tried today. The garlic sauce is not too heavy and blends with the fish well. It is close to heavy on the soy like sauce, close to heavy (on the medium side), so if you don't like the heavy sauce factor let them know. It had about five really decent sized white or flounder like fish. The fish weren't artificial or nasty, really clean, good soft texture. The fish is accompanied with broccoli, a piece of seaweed, delicious slices of water chestnut.The Chicken Corn Soup that is included with the Lunch Special or on their soup menu is very good, it includes little pieces of chicken, carrots, celery, corn and a egg dropped in to create a thick but very tasty chicken noodle soup flavor but without the noodles. The only question does that good flavor come from scratch or stock/powder, regardless, it is good.In summary, the food is not spectacular worth driving a long trip to try, but decent and again above average for the locale and close proximity for the people in the neighborhood."

I got a call from him after order through grubhub, when  I picked up he murmured something along the lines of having me go get my food - I wasn't sure what he said and assumed he was at my apartment so I said ""are you here? I can buzz you in, I'm at apartment 4A"". That was when he aggressively yelled at me ""NO, I SAID COME DOWN"" and kept yelling at me to go downstairs (he obviously wasn't willing to deliver it to my apartment door). In addition to that, the food was mushy, oily and cold. Will NEVER order from this place again. For those who are thinking of getting food delivered - make sure you've got other people in your apartment - other reviews have talked about him blocking doors and not letting you get back into your apartment because people refuse to tip."

The mooshu pork and pancakes are the best- favorite thing we ordered. Delicious flavor! The singapore noodles were very very good - we ordered them spicy and the curry flavor was on point. The fried wontons were more fried wrapper than meat- very tasty- but wish there was more meat. The fried rice was good - basic fried rice. Very quick delivery too!

Especially for a person who rarely if ever eats fast food. I wouldn't take family here nor recommend friends come to this establishment. I really tried after first horrible visit to give Wendy's the benefit of doubt. Everyone has a bad day. Not this business. Everyday is a bad day. Take my advice go to another place.

I have come here on several occasions and something is always missing from my order ,whether I use the drive-thru or go inside. The drive through line is always super long. The parking lot could have been set up a little better. The line for the drive thru cuts through the parking lot. So if you went inside to order, when you come out there is an 80% chance you are now blocked in by drive thru line. The people taking the orders are very slow and not the most pleasant to deal with. I think Ill be driving the extra miles to a different Wendys."

To say that they move at a snail's pace is actually a gross underestimation of the speed of a snail! It likely would not be as bad if DoorDash orders were sent in and prepared prior to the arrival of the dasher, rather than having dashers wait on the same line to order and receive food as the customers trying to get food for themselves. It is a major inconvenience not only to the dashers that are expected to wait on line for 30 minutes for an order that will only give them $7, thus wasting precious time that could have been spent on orders from other restaurants that have a more efficient system in place, but also to the customers whose orders are GUARANTEED to be delivered at least 20 minutes past the expected wait time estimated on the app. Truly an awful experience."

While Williamsburg is not the first or even fifth neighborhood that would come to mind as a place to get dim sum in the city, Dim Sum Bar is working to prove me wrong by delivering high quality dim sum at a reasonable cost, at least, for the neighborhood. You're not going to find any pushcarts here, but you will find a pretty long menu featuring both the classics and some dishes from other regions of China like soup dumplings, which are Shanghainese, and Mapo tofu, which is Sichuanese. The pushcart dim sum experience is great for neophytes to the cuisine since you don't even need to know what a dish is called when you can just point to things on a cart. Dim Sum Bar's space saving solution to having no pushcarts  is via their glossy menus, which feature high-def photos of each dish so you know exactly what you're getting when you order. No surprise ""Phoenix claws"" here!My party of 4 enjoyed quite a spread of small plates which all had us smacking our lips (#respectfully). The mapo tofu, which was made vegetarian here was a favorite at the table, with a nice amount of spice and an amazing amount of flavor. The pan seared turnip cakes, dumplings in chili oil, har gow, and rice rolls were also unanimously loved. My table was less enthused about the soup dumplings, which weren't soupy or flavorful enough, but I realize soup dumplings are a difficult recipe to master, and everything else we ordered here was fantastic.We dined outdoors in their back patio, which was partially enclosed, a bit too much for my comfort but we happened to go on a quiet afternoon with no other parties near us. The plastic partitions between each table are little more than hygiene theater and don't do much in preventing you from inhaling virus laden air, but we lucked out by being the only party present at the time. The heater was nice and strong and we sat directly beneath it, so an al fresco meal here in NYC winter weather was actually very comfortable.As much as I love supporting Chinatown businesses, finding a table at a dim sum restaurant on 8th avenue or in Manhattan's chinatown can be difficult, so it's nice to have places like Dim Sum Bar bringing a taste of Guangdong to Williamsburg."

1842,1fDtQij01Mk92ZTGn6WHjg,2/26/2020,3 star rating,"3/5 --Would go again!Great spot for some dim sum. The shumai was most definitely the star! We ordered 2 servings 8pcs because we just love shumai and theirs' is great! The wrap was perfect, softly steamed and held everything together. The flavors were all there and I am so happy that this version was not overly salty. A lot of dim sum spots in my opinion often have a heavy hand when it comes to the salt. Second fave was the steamed shrimp dumpling with the white (translucent) wrap. So good! The salt and pepper calamari is very spicy. --And I love spicy but this was too much. It was also too salty. This particular dish was also greasy from being deep fried. I like the idea of how they presented the fried calamari on a bed of lettuce and a fried sheet of an egg roll but it was just all too much grease. It's like layered oil, I would pass on this.  Crispy noodles with beef was good but too salty. If I got this next time I would ask for a side of steam bok Chou or steamed jasmine rice to help balance. Otherwise I would also pass on this dish. The green beans was odd. Didn't enjoy this. The flavors were heavy and overpowering. Egg drop soup was delicious!Soup dumplings were so disappointing! It wasn't hot. When you have soup dumplings you want to see the steam as you remove the lid! That is key to knowing this will be delicious and knowing that it was cooked long enough. The wrap was way to thick. The combination of semi-warm dumpling soup and thick wrap just was a hard no for us. --The dish is good otherwise, just please use thinner skin and serve it hot then it will be perfect. I would definitely come back to try other dim sum dishes. Drools just thinking of the shumai :)"

I added a bit of simple syrup and it was spot on.  It was a perfect complement​ to the rainy day and kept me warm on the walk home. As hungry as I was, I waited to eat the sandwich when I got home.  I only ate half of the sandwich because something about the flavor was a bit off.  I couldn't tell if it was pickled off or off for some other reason so I decided to eat half and wait to see if I felt ill.  I didn't but I still couldn't go back to it.  The interior of the space is cute for studying or working comfortably for some time.  My final judgment: I'd come here for a study session and ​amazing matcha.  I would try the food again in a pinch but definitely​ go with something other than the banh mi."

The cake was incredibly moist and one of the better vegan cakes I've had. I also had the vegan raw chocolate chip cookie dough ball that was coated in chocolate ganache. There are no words for me to describe how good it was...Despite being a smaller cafe, they have about five tables and a few other chairs. The setup is a bit rigid, though, so the ambiance is not the best. They have a great menu of sandwiches with plenty of vegan options as well. The drink menu was a bit disappointing because there aren't any unique roasts or syrups. The cashier was nice but it's important all the workers know their food. For example, she didn't know the kind of cookie dough that was covered in the ganache. I was buying it either way but it's better if she was able to tell me.

They seem to have a smashing time dolling out the quick qUirKy banter with their usual white hipster customers though. Their croissants (god bless croissants) are bland and ultra oily and idk how it's physically possible to bake croissants that unappetizing. Actually most of their pastries/quiches I wouldn't recommend. They do have a wonderful strawberry basil lemonade which was delightful and refreshing on hot summer days. And I enjoy their mochas! And LOVE their apple turnovers. not sure if they bake those themselves. The best facet of this place is their seating and plants arrangement. Very conducive to working/studying. Spacious enough and plenty of natural lighting. A couple of ugly gentrification junkyard aesthetic pieces but easy to ignore.

I already knew I wanted their signature malfadini scampi, but still asked our server to explain a few other dishes. He did such a wonderful job explaining without over selling. We both got the malfadini and then the fluke crudo, tuna crudo and cauliflower. Everything was great, but I would definitely return for the malfadini scampi and the fluke!"

I started off with the sanguigno which was lovely and then i was happy when they were able to make me a limoncello spritz! We got all 3 toasts to split for the table and they were great. I think the fluke one was my favorite, but the tuna was amazing too. The ribeye panino was my absolute FAVORITE. You have to order one! Out of the pasta, the mafaldini was great. The carbonara on the other hand tho was good, but a little dry for my taste. The smashed potatoes were a great side and my friends said they loved their scrambled eggs and little gem salads. Will be coming back for dinner in the near future!"

Also very accommodating to my dairy allergy."

As a first timer, I had to try the mafaldini scampi and a glass of rioja to pair with it. The breadcrumbs add a really nice crunch to the pasta. The texture of the noodles were amazing. Great chunks of shrimp with a rich, but not overwhelming garlic butter flavor. An added bonus was the complimentary breadsticks with  Calabrian chili spread with mushrooms, onions, and artichokes. The spread is phenomenal and has a great kick to it!Lovely neighborhood spot that I'll be back to try the rest of the menu."

She was so kind, personable and accommodating to our group of 9. She was really thorough as she explained the development and story of each flavor we tasted. In total I think we tasted about 20 different flavors, some year round, some seasonal. My favorites were the banana foster and the key lime pie. The vanilla bourbon was also super good. She answered all of our questions and also shared her journey with Tipsy Scoop from her start, through the pandemic and as they reopened. The sundae making part of the class was obviously the best part, we got to choose two flavors for the sundae and decorate with tons of different toppings from cookies, cones, drizzles and candy. Get the brûléed marshmallow!! Overall this was a great experience and I would definitely do another class with them."

Boozy ice cream that doesn't compromise on taste.  It's only 5% ABV, so you probably won't catch a buzz from just one scoop, but why stop with one? A scoop is $6 which seems really reasonable considering  the comparable prices of non-boozy ice cream options in the neighborhood. They have a number of vegan options also. The mango margarita sorbet was incredible. Great service. I have to go back to try an ice cream flight!"

Keep in mind when delivering, signature is required since contents have alcohol on it. 21+ must sign. My brother & his wife loved the ice cream! They also said it was packed so well! Still frozen when it got delivered, across country! We live in CA. Each ice cream flavor is unique and delicious in its own way. Having boozy ice cream is a fun way to unwind!

Their frozen cocktails are great (from what I hear, I don't drink) and the atmosphere is hip and eclectic without being too in your face about it. They offer dope food selections (try the vegan curry pot pie...sooo good!) and have pinball machines in the back room. I've never seen a StarWars pinball machine before, but I'm pretty sure I've spent enough money on that thing to buy it by now. 5 stars all around."

I came here to meet a drink for Happy Hour on a Thursday but will definitely be returning for a night out. Their Happy Hour is bomb with $2 off of their already cheap drinks. I got 2 cocktails for $5 each and they were pretty generous pours. They have a decent menu of 70s style cocktails usually for $7 each. Beers seemed to range from $3-6 and wines from $8-9. **NOTE: Birdy's is cash only**It was nice out so we sat at a small table just outside but inside there are really comfy booths and lots of bar seating. When it got chilly we went to the back where we were met with a couple of pool tables but we went for the old school pinball machines instead. Birdy's doesn't have a kitchen but, committing to the 70's aesthetic, if you ask the bartender they'll give you a binder full of take out menus. No grub hub required."

The Miami vice may be the best frozen drink ever invented and birdys has found how to make it better than the one you find in Miami. The creaminess of the pina colado matched with the tartness of the daiquiri is a match made in heaven. My soul is up

Cash only bar with a pretty chill vibe that gets busy after 12am. Got a cocktail for $7 which is a bargain compared across the river or in wburg. Crowd is pretty hipster. Didn't get a chance to play pinball but next time!

Oh well. Not her finest hour, though she offered to charge despite it being a cash only bar (which, like, it's 2015, dude, stop cheating your taxes). The owner of the joint, some young German-flag bomber jacket wearing guy, start harassing her at the bar, but she removes herself.This is the insane part: He follows her across the bar and ~continues~ to harass her, this time opening up his tantrum onto me and my partner, the two people sitting with her. Finally, he tells us he's not throwing us out, though we should leave. BUT THEN: he looks my partner up and down, the only WHITE person among us, and says ""you're probably fine."" When I and the other black person involved--the only two black people in the bar, as it turns out--had tried to deescalate the situation, it was the white guy he chose to leave alone.I've heard anecdotally that this has happened to A LOT of black people at this bar. Don't come here, unless your the sort of person who the owner seems to be keeping this place for, the sort of person who scares when then there's a little extra melanin around."

Other places won't even give you ketchup with your order unless you specifically ask for it. This McDonalds actually has the chicken tenders, which locations by me won't even offer anymore even though its on their menu. This location has a working ice cream machine, which is also a rare find in the outer boroughs, especially Queens where they seem to be closing the restaurants left and right. I think that this place is excellent. They even have a greeter saying hello and goodbye when you leave and they clean this place constantly. It seems like one of the flagship stores in my opinion. Maybe its because its really busy, but I think they do a good job."

The service is always solid and the food is just as great! I love there ramen but my favorite is their poke bowls. Any of them are good but my go to is the spicy tuna or the pork bowl. The restaurant is a little small so call ahead if you're sitting inside or order out if needed. The inside of the restaurant is very cute!

I definitely could have been more specific. The soup was definitely the best part of the bowl, but I also really enjoyed the noodles. It was thick, and I enjoy them on the harder side. Unlike lots of noodles in recent ramen, this one had a good taste of flour (in a good way) and had the thickness to give me a really good mouthful. For the soup, I tried the Susuru Paitan for round one and swapped with my partner, and ate the Kuro ramen with kaedama. As my first time trying Paitan Ramen, I didn't know what to expect, but it went beyond my expectations. The soup was fatty, yet almost light and aromatic? The flavours would dance throughout my mouth pleasantly unlike really fatty broths that smother throughout my mouth. The Kuro ramen was dominantly garlic-flavoured, but if you want to enjoy more of the balance of flavours rather than having a dominant ingredient, I highly recommend the Susuru Paitan. Oh, also, I had the chicken karaage and I had no issues or complaints. It was done very well and reminds me of my mom's karaage.The only reason this place doesn't get a 5-star is because I only give 5 stars to the places that absolutely blow my mind. I highly recommend you all get some ramen here if you can!"

In fact, several Japanese patrons with suitcases came in during my visit as well, which I always take to be a hallmark of authenticity.The broths are very tasty and the noodles are bouncy. It's hard to describe and one would be best served just giving Susuru a try. Amazingly, they're quite affordable as well compared to the quality.Bonus points for having a nice selection of local beer, too."

The SAUCE was tangy and crisp OOF so good. I'd put it on everything. I would LOVE if they made an actual katsu Sando out of this in addition to the bao version. I want to just keep eating my way through it instead of having a couple bites and the experience ending there. Admittedly not the friendliest or cleanest spot. There was a huge freaky bug that was running around but I do imagine that could've also been because of the heat. Anyways it didn't really bother me too much lol, coming for the food, and so long as it's good I don't really care if staff are a little dry."

We arrived around 1pm on a Saturday, and it was busy but we managed to get the last available table. Though the space is small, it's clean and pleasant to look at. Word of warning for the winter - if you sit at the two seats to the right of the door, it can get pretty cold since anytime the door is opened you'll be hit by the cold. We tried their chicken karaage, Kuro ramen and veggie miso ramen. For drinks we got white peach chu-hi (fruit sake) and Kyoto matcha IPA. Everything was well portioned and tasty. We loved the karaage, it was so juicy and flavored just right! The white peach sake was also amazing and tasted just like juice. The ramen was great too, though I wouldn't go out of my way to have it again. I added chili oil and corn to my Kuro ramen to give it a bit more pizazz.

I was appalled to see only one person working for the entire restaurant. A lone manager handling all the food stations, the cashier and everything. As you can imagine ordering and receiving your meal was a lengthy process, but this lone manager was pleasant and for the only one there efficient. When questioned about the lack of staff blatantly missing, she said it was a decision made by management to cut costs. Disgusting. Disgusting both to this wonderful employee and to the customers that suffer due to your inability to properly staff your restaurant. I am a long time fan of KFC but I honestly don't know when I will go back there, if this is the way they treat there customers and employees.

He just poured the drink into my cup knowing that it was only 3/4 filled without all the ice. He didn't even bother adding more of the strawberry juice into the cup to fill it up. I had to say something to another barista telling him that the cup isn't even filled. Excuse my language but I paid for a full cup of drink and not for 3/4 cup of drink with a shitload of ice... the barista who took care of my order didn't even give a shit.

There's also two cushion ""seats"" by the window and a couple of bar stools where you pick up your order.2. Service - When I went (Sunday afternoon), there was a longer line to use the restroom than to actually order something. However, even with how empty it was. The register barista was snappy and seemed way too impatient for a lineless Starbucks. Although I'm not usually sensitive about being barked to (c'mon usually these places have way too many customers; cut them some slack), there was NO ONE HERE, so don't yell at me... Perhaps they are usually really busy, so they are in that ""order and go"" sort of mindset."

What was the point of the barista asking if I wanted whip if they wouldn't really give me anyway?...The hot chocolate itself is a bit watered down. What the heck!

They have these window seats which are lovely and large but you're not going to cozy up with a stranger even in friendliest of cities and drink coffee on a cushy bench. I love it though. I'm glad they opened one I like though I never sit at Starbucks anymore in the city. Now I have WiFi in the apartment plus an iPhone 5. I used to hang out a lot 3 years ago at the 66th and 3rd, which has a lot of seating and chatty regulars. Still it's nice to have one within a block of Burger Heaven which serves bilge water passing for coffee. I only go to Burger Heaven at all for breakfast because I love the people who work there and the view is so nice. The Artisan sandwich is a nice cheap breakfast option now that Wrap 'n Run has closed for good. The fire/flood a few trips ago was so sad for the owner who still owns one up town in the high 70s. I miss my Caribbean smoothie and I don't think Starbucks smoothies are anything to write home about.Last week, I ordered a tall coffee (that's all I ever order at Starbucks other than the sandwiches) and there had to have been two tablespoons of coffee grounds at the bottom. I meant to keep the cup but threw it out and they replaced it without proof of purchase. I thought that was very nice. I might sit here with my laptop if there were anywhere to sit but the communal table is always jammed. This is like a commuter Starbucks but nicer inside."
1920,YV0VaJgV2zotzI7XNUaMCQ,8/16/2018,2 star rating,I ordered a grande strawberry açaí with light ice and the barista didn't read the order carefully and he put a bunch of ice into the shaker and when he was pouring the drink into my cup he then realized that I asked for light ice. He just poured the drink into my cup knowing that it was only 3/4 filled without all the ice. He didn't even bother adding more of the strawberry juice into the cup to fill it up. I had to say something to another barista telling him that the cup isn't even filled. Excuse my language but I paid for a full cup of drink and not for 3/4 cup of drink with a shitload of ice... the barista who took care of my order didn't even give a shit. Very unsatisfied with the service.
1921,YV0VaJgV2zotzI7XNUaMCQ,9/8/2014,3 star rating,"I mean, it's a Starbucks so there's only a couple things you really need to know. Unfortunately I didn't use the bathroom, so no comments on that -- other than the huge line I saw for it.1. Seating - There is one of those large computer tables that seats eight. There's also two cushion ""seats"" by the window and a couple of bar stools where you pick up your order.2. Service - When I went (Sunday afternoon), there was a longer line to use the restroom than to actually order something. However, even with how empty it was. The register barista was snappy and seemed way too impatient for a lineless Starbucks. Although I'm not usually sensitive about being barked to (c'mon usually these places have way too many customers; cut them some slack), there was NO ONE HERE, so don't yell at me... Perhaps they are usually really busy, so they are in that ""order and go"" sort of mindset."

Not only I had to wait an extra 5min, but the cup was sitting behind the counter while staff is goofing off on each other. I played dumb and asked if the online was working. One says yes and the other says, Oh his coffee is right there, give it to him. No apologies. Just..here. smdh. This location sucks"

Seriously, this is the slowest Starbucks I've ever been to and the staff clearly couldn't care less about that. Mobile orders are the worst. What's the point of ordering 10 minutes ahead if I still have to wait another 10 minutes in the store? The most confusing part is that the food is always ready before the drink (and is cold by the time the drink arrives). Every other location I've been to has been the opposite. Also, 4 people behind the counter and only 1 making drinks? Common on, guys."

1934,ckuFutONOBo_rrscCkLUBw,12/8/2018,3 star rating,It's your normal Starbucks but what drives me nuts about this location is the people who will sit for hours and not buy anything. I sit in Starbucks for an hour at most and work and always spend money. I feel like that's just good manners. I wish the staff would enforce this even a little bit. It's a small location and people should NOT use it as their office. It's a coffee shop for Christ's sake

And when asking one of the workers about a drink after a good 20 minutes, she told us to move away from her. I have never seen anyone ruder. It would be nice to know she does not ruin anyone else's day. Also, I was late to work due to this inconvenience. I hope she reevaluates her morals and treats people nice. One more thing, I asked for extra ice and got the least amount of ice as possible. I noticed once I left and I was in a hurry to work. I hope for other customers this does not happen again."

I've had a lot of vegan asian food in my nearly ten years of eating a plant-based diet and Jujube Tree nails it every time. Whenever I dine in the wait staff are always warm and helpful, and the ambiance is pleasant and relaxed. Jujube Tree's menu is large without being overwhelming and offers a wide range of flavors (they even have vegan thai iced tea) and the portions are generous, especially for their affordable price points. For diners with food allergies Jujube has many options including gluten free and nut free offerings. Order the Age Tofu, Steamed Dumplings,  and Citrus Soy Protein to get the full Jujube experience!"

The lunch special plate is pretty good for the price. We got the teriyaki seitan, bbq tempeh, and stir fried soba noodles. All were very delicious. The seitan was incredible texture. The tempeh was very nice too and I don't always love tempeh. The soba noodles had a lot of veggies mixed in, very filling. The only reason I have to give this place one less star is because the service was very underwhelming. We were basically the only ones there more than half our meal but the server was kinda cold and basically MIA, forgetting to bring things we requested. There was also no AC which made the place pretty warm for sitting. Maybe they are trying to deter diners and cater more to takeout customers. The food honestly was pretty good but I would only order takeout if I wanted food from here in the future."

It hurts to see any vegan restaurant not do well. At the end of the day, I could not recommend. For starters, there was no one else there. Not a great sign.We had:- scallion pancakes: dry, crispy, and ridiculously small- spring rolls: too few, bland, and seemed like the frozen store bought variety, not fresh- the zen bowl: incredibly bland. No seasonings or flavor or anything apart From the sauce, which I didn't like. Tofu was not marinated, seasoned, or even cut down to a proper size. The seaweed wasn't to my palette - tasted eggy and off. It was just a bowl of giant veggies over rice - super overpriced for what it was. - we ordered two of the specialty meat dishes. They come with way too little meat and a small bowl of rice for $20. The meat is nothing special, just the dense soy stuff you can get from the store coated in a little sauce. Not extremely flavorful or realistic in texture, as some other vegan meats can be. Overall, super bland, not fresh, boring food for unreasonable prices. With so many great tasting vegan options in NY I don't see myself going back :("

As we looked through the menu, I noticed the multitude of foods they offer and the options were all so appetizing. From the juicy seitan skewers to the crispy tofu skin wrap to the colorful Korean rice bowl, everything was so positive and delicious. Finished the meal without feeling upset/bloated or hungry. No complaints at all! I'm not a vegetarian, love my meats but I have to say, this restaurant killed it with the way they prepared and cooked their soy protein dishes. Not only was the food top-notch, it was also very price-friendly. We got two appetizers and a main rice bowl for $35! In addition, the owners of the business were also very friendly and accommodating. The environment and seating arrangements were all very neat, organized, and clean.

Everything was delicious however the portions were very small for the price. When I came here years ago, the portion was much larger that's my only complain about the food. This place lost a star because they added their own gratuity to my bill even though it was just the two of us. I didn't have an option in how I wanted to tip and I do not like that."

I got only one cheese burger instead of two, two plain burgers, the nuggets meal and the nuggets alone order and the quarter pounder was uncooked and unable to consume. I spent $30.75 for this order and I had to throw away my quarter pounder away because it was ""RAW"".

My boyfriend and I had one savory and one dessert crepes. The buckwheat option is rare to see in many other French spot. We really like the crispy texture of the lemon sugar crepes. The berry compote always taste like home-made.  The snails is a little bit salty when we had our first bite, but it balance well with the toast that comes with it. If you like garlic, you will like this dish a lot. It's definite a good spot for some Sunday brunch crepe craving. Overall, a very cute spot for brunch. Four tables for outdoor seating. FYI, the store does not open on Monday and Tuesday so make sure you check the hours before you go."

Going anywhere else for these dishes would be a disservice to you and anyone you're dining with. Super cozy and great spot for a date with the S.O.

1972,td-ANnbKeuQ0Z-XwWgxWaA,12/27/2020,4 star rating,"One of my favorite brunch spots and where I go to when I'm craving French. Had their brunch specials that consist of a drink and main. I had Croque Monsieur with a cup of coffee one time and Eggs Nordic with glass of mimosa another time. Both times I shared a crepe for dessert with a friend - their crepe is French style, super thin, not too sweet, very light. I've tried their Lemon and sugar crepe, simple but so good. I hope to visit soon to try their lunch/dinner menu!"

I came with my sister and she was shocked that she hadn't heard of the place. We split a crepe and french toast. Our server swore it's the best french toast. It's really tasty but definitely not the best I've ever had...Crepe is really good. Hard to find a great crepe in the US. Basically, you're going to a legit french restaurant to get this. Really liked the atmosphere of the place. We came on a Sunday brunch."

The egg was perfectly runny and the ham delicious. Having had such a stellar experience with the savory I then ordered a dessert crepe of Nutella, as I usually do in France. Big disappointment with this one. The Nutella crepe barely had any Nutella, it was just sprinkled on top instead of the thick layer inside that it's supposed to have. The crepe was also too thin and dry. In short-savory is the way to go here, the sweet crepes still need some work. Oh and they have a changing table in the bathroom! Good to know they're baby friendly as it's a small space."

Smoked Salmon was just okay, there is better quality out there. This was a really good brunch dish.Coffee is really amazing here, grab a cup!"

Honestly, the chef is an artist.This is really an excellent French breakfast/brunch spot.

1979,td-ANnbKeuQ0Z-XwWgxWaA,3/7/2021,5 star rating,"This has been our favorite restaurant in - not just Astoria - but all of NYC for several years now... and the best part of our ""weekend ritual"". I had mixed feelings writing this review before the pandemic because we (selfishly) didn't want to risk drawing attention to this gem of a place, worried that it would become too busy for us to get a table and ruin its charm. But with so many great restaurants struggling we couldn't do so any longer.The combination of Chef Philippe's cooking, Charlene's hospitality, and the cozy and relaxed vibe make for a truly unparalleled, authentic experience. This is as Parisian a cafe as any you'll find in Europe. Charlene is ultra friendly and accommodating. You'll feel immediately welcome, and the other patrons are local and often French. The wine list they offer is small and though we are partial to the Bordeaux, you can't make a bad choice among them. We've had almost everything on the menu but making our rotation most frequently are the French onion soup, escargot, goat cheese crepe, chicken and lamb crepe, chicken cordon bleu, and ribeye steak. Whatever you might order, Chef Philippe won't disappoint. For us, there is no better way to unwind after a long week and ease in to the weekend than a night at Cafe Triskell. Sipping on wine and taking in the food, music, and company on a given evening, you'll be loath to leave. This is food, service, and ambiance at its peak."
1980,S7ivv5O0beH3U9cV3cRD_Q,10/28/2021,4 star rating,"My entire motivation for coming here was the restaurant's fleeing appearance in Ghostbusters (1984). While I didn't grow up in NYC, I moved here for college & then after graduate school & made a habit of visiting not only famous eateries, but those that had a place in popular or niche culture.  Sometimes those two categories intersected quite well.Though as I'm also no fan of seafood, I skipped that & went with their lasagna. It was excellent, as was the service & general atmosphere."

I say this with the understanding that the pandemic didn't help. Business ought to be back with seasonal adjustments. This was mid-November.   My first pick next door was packed so I decided to circle back to Umberto's for dinner. Umberto's was practically empty with only one other group for Friday evening. I decided to sit at the bar. The bartender was very polite and attentive. Service was efficient. Good conversation and choice of drinks.The menu options seemed extensive specializing in seafood. I decided to order the tortellini with grilled chicken and a Caesar salad. Simple enough. What showed up might have been an off night. The salad was average with barely any dressing and processed 'Parmesan' cheese. Next, the tortellini must have suffered under the microwave with barely any 'grilled' chicken. The entire dish looked like it came from a ready meal mixed with a can of chicken soup. Everything tasted bland. It all seemed lazy or uninspired. The entire dinner was a disappointment. I let it go and decided to pay my bill. I doubt the 'karaoke night' was enough of a crutch. Empty restaurants are empty for a reason...customers go where the food is good."

No need to worry about bones. My wife had the red snapper marchiaro. It was fantastic and again the fish was cooked perfectly. My 13 year old had the black linguine with shrimp and calamari and I was concerned it might be a little too adventurous for him. Pasta and sauce were the best we ever had. He cleaned his plate. I had the linguine and clams it was very good but overshadowed by the other dishes. Don't get distracted by the clams when you eat here. The next time I will get my clam fix as an appetizer.

I was like, YAH, EXPLODE.And my heart explode when I got my first bite. It was horrible. It was dry, and tasted like chocolate. And the amount of chocolate inside is like minimum.ARE YOU REALLY SERIOUSLY KIDDING ME?I am hugely disappointed and basically I won't come back.I mean, maybe the timing is not right but don't they know that bakeries are tasting s*t if they are not properly reserved?

I came here to meet a date and it was a lovely place for a conversation. I could also see myself getting some work done on the corner if needed. Great location in Midtown to escape the shopping crowds. The pastries were really good in general. We tried several. Less sweet and lower sugar which made me very happy in these options. I would only suggest a more traditional approach to the carrot cake.

Nevertheless, I often like to venture out and try new places whenever I can. Having walked passed Gregory's a number of times, I finally decided to step through the front doors and try it out for myself. Overall, I was pretty impressed with this place. The prices are a little steep, but nothing steeper than you would encounter at a similar premium coffee shop.As with most eclectic coffee places, I generally like to try a signature drink and a pastry to really get the full experience. At Gregory's I opted for an Amaca (Columbian coffee press with chocolate, baking spice, and clean grapefruit tasting notes) and a chocolate wafer. The coffee was definitely as I had hoped: robust, flavorful, and smooth (no burned or overly bitter taste). It's the type of coffee that you could drink with or without milk or sugar, which is always a positive in my book! As for the chocolate wafer? It was awesome! About the size of a large cookie, it was chewy and sweet with just the right amount of dark chocolate. I would almost come back here just for that, but then again, I do have an impartial sweet tooth.Aside from the items that I ordered, Gregory's coffee also offers an array of drip and blend coffees, espressos, cappuccinos, iced drinks, teas and more. Most drinks are offered in small, medium or large, although the signature beverages (such as the Amaca) are one-size only. The store also offers an array of pastries (muffins, cookies, brownies, croissants, etc.) and even some merchandise for those who really love this brand.Service here is also very good. The staff is quick and friendly (the former quality is especially important in midtown), and the employees have a good understanding of the coffee they serve.Overall, I was very happy with my visit here. While it is a bit out of my way, I would certainly consider stopping by again for another premium cup of joe!"

I came in yesterday with a blue hoody carrying my luggage with me as I was headed to the airport. I received the ultimate staredown predominantly by the hassidic jews also waiting in line to grab a bite but I understand particularly in current times why my middle eastern appearance (though I am Armenian) stirred up so much attention. I didn't let that stop me from ordering one of the most delicious bagels I've ever had. The everything bagel combined with an ample amount of scallion spread was absolute perfection. The eatery itself was organized and clean and I found the area itself quite charming. I actually preferred the small town feel of Midwood over the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my culinary experience here. I live in Las Vegas but if I am ever in the area again, I will certainly return."

I ordered the California eggs benedict which is 2 poached eggs with tomato and avocado. The order arrived fairly quickly. I was aware that breakfast deliveries are usually not great.

Eggs beni were over cooked to the point yolks were not runny, instead dry.   I wish they did make better food and that all their servers were attentive.

2015,VRfXwMDG8zA71GphHfeMKg,1/2/2016,1 star rating,"Like they say, its all good until you find a hair in your food.  So as the story is told, we come in to just have a late breakfast sandwich. This is where G orders his breakfast sandwiches all of the time and he really loves them. They are very prompt in delivery to the house and the food for G seems to be good. Keep in mind he pretty much orders only the breakfast sandwich for delivery and usually when he is being lazy or not feeling well and I am not home to fix him food.Back to our breakfast sandwich today. It was busy here at Bell Diner today, so we opted to sit at the bar area. For G it was a scrambled egg breakfast sandwich, whole wheat bread toasted, with crispy bacon and cheese. For me I choose the 2 eggs over medium breakfast sandwich on toasted white bread, crispy bacon and cheese. The sandwiches were served up promptly and both looked very tasty. Mine was served open faced which was a new experience. I guess because my eggs were more sunny side up and the yolk was very runny they opted for this type of presentation.  It looked amazingly good and I decided to just eat it with a knife and fork, rather than to put it together and make a sandwich. It was at about the 3 forkfull/bite mark that I noticed the very long light colored hair. OH NO! Its not mine. And how do I know this...well. #1 it was not on top of the sandwich and I was not brushing my hair while eating, #2 this hair was hooked to the cheese and between the cheese and the egg. OH GOOD GOSH! Its downhill from appetizing at that point. G called the manager over to show him the rogue long hair and as he took my food away he turned around and said something to the affect do you want another or can I fix you another sandwich,  my response had no filter......""OH HELL NO"". Maybe I should not have been so emphatic about my desire to not have this hair laden sandwich replaced but that was all that my mind thought about at the time. All I wanted was to get out of Bell Diner as fast as I could. I guess I should be thankful that it was not a bug in the sandwich, but for me it might as well have been a bug. G continued to eat his sandwich. I said, well you just enjoy your sandwich and hopefully yours is hair free. G said, I'm eating this till I find a hair. Guys are strange sometimes. I mean he saw that long freakin hair that came out of my sandwich. This was no short hair, it was extremely long. I must have pulled that thing out 6 inches and it was still stuck to the sandwich cheese.  To top off the experience, the bill came with the hairy sandwich charged. Oh no they didn't. Lets just see how much I can tolerate, which by now is not much more. G went all GI JOE on me and grabbed the bill and said he would take care of it, but I was having no such thing till I actually took a picture of the bill. He quickly went to the register and had the offending sandwich removed from the bill. At the register I heard the manager saying to G that no one in the back has long blonde hair. Well someone somewhere in that back got a long hair on my sandwich. As I told G walking out, I might eat my own hair, and I might eat his hair, but I for sure am not eating some strangers hair. I thought G was going to die laughing. As in the beginning, the moral here is its all good until someone gets an eye poked out or a hair in their food. Then its all bad."

They have good food and that is the ONLY reason we continue to go but my family and I have been coming here for years now and every single time it's the same unfriendly and unpleasant service from waiters. And right after we eat we end up STILL saying how unpleasant and unfriendly the waiter was (again).Apart from the one female who works the register occasionally and the owner's sons? The waitstaff don't even bother to greet you and when you ask for something it feels like you're burdening them. It's not one or a handful of waiters, it's most of them. Whenever we go we get the same waiters that rotate. For sure they recognize us as we come at least every 2 weeks and still No smiles, no pleasant demeanor, no friendliness.We don't expect much but when you're having breakfast first thing in the morning, it really would make for a pleasant eating experience if the wait staff themselves would be more pleasant. The cold stoic faces with attitude really keeps us from wanting to return again every single time. I hope the owner/manager reads this because the waitstaff need to be re-trained on service, mannerisms with customers. Seriously, a little goes a long way. A smile wouldn't kill either"

Not worthy , nope I'm disappointed, I just got out of work from a catering hall, New Years I'm hoping to get some breakfast with a friend and as soon we walk in this lady has a nasty face on I order two number 13's sausage burritos , and when it's ready she pours in the soda I tell I want one of the sodas to be Sprite since she just finished filling one of the cups with Coke , you know what she tells me?? ""Oh, now you say that huh, with very monstrous body language, now I have worked in Taco Bell before so I'm used to the environment but there was literally like 5 people in the entire store , what is she so impatient about , it's not that hard especially when my cup was still empty if that's too much work for her , she definitely doesn't deserve $15 an hour. Please to the owner of this establishment look at who was working today and fire this cashier it's obvious she's not appreciative. It's New Years I get it but this crossed the line."
2022,0zxGc7hit7mFSk2o1PvIdQ,2/19/2014,1 star rating,"Such a badly run McDonalds. I'm writing this in comparison to all the other McDonalds I've been to in NYC. This one in particular takes such a long time to serve your food. Salads often take 10+ minutes. There's only 1 line, and 2 other people in front of me, and it takes 10 minutes to make a salad. If I were the manager, I would serious consider playing ""Diner Dash"" and figure out how to make sure food is prepared, so that it can be served on-time. It's not really unreasonable to assume food will usually take less than 5 minutes to be served at McDonalds (a FAST FOOD establishment), and if it does take longer, why not tell the customer to expect the wait."

2024,h37t9rA06Sr4EetJjKrfzw,3/3/2023,4 star rating,"It was a pleasant Monday afternoon. No crowds a few tourists but my 1st experience in this lovely SoHo building. It was covered with the ice cream theme: history, sprinkles, a slide, games that are found in arcades and lots of free unlimited ice cream to eat.The place is very clean and fun. There are stations to play, other stations to learn the history of making ice cream from Carvel to Ben&Jerry. I liked the display of scoops from the years past. Lots of interaction for all ages as a sprinkle pool, a huge slide to go down to the basement, and some games.All in All it's a nice way to spend some time doing something Sweet!Surprise: During your birthday month you get a free ticket!"
2025,h37t9rA06Sr4EetJjKrfzw,11/26/2022,2 star rating,"I am a firm believer that you and your people ARE and MAKE the experience, and I must apply it here. If you want to go because of the experience, go ahead! However, keep in mind that the place is not necessarily worth the price, in my opinion. I expected at least some basic information on Ice Cream, I don't know, maybe an intro at the beginning or at least media with videos or something...because it does have the word museum on it. Also, the ice cream was basic, vanilla, chocolate....peanut butter...I expected unique or innovative flavors, or even more options. At least they had vegan options for the hubs, which was ok since we visited because he's obsessed with ice cream.If you like cute photos then this is down your alley. The staff was energetic and cheerful, but the ice cream was no better than a pint of Ben & Jerry's from the supermarket. Nonetheless, we had fun. Now, we would have fun even in the most boring of places, so choose your crowd carefully and I guarantee you will have a great time regardless."
2026,h37t9rA06Sr4EetJjKrfzw,11/9/2022,4 star rating,"If we didn't have a five-year-old daughter obsessed with all things ice cream, pink, and rainbows, we'd skip the Museum of Ice Cream. But we decided to splurge on just under $40 per ticket and a $18 sundae at the end for our daughter. Was it worth it to see the joy on her face? Yes.Here's our experience after going in the afternoon on a Monday in November:1) Admission: It's expensive. Before you buy tickets, Google to see if there's a deal. We easily found one for 10% off our total bill. Also, skip buying an overpriced, average sundae at the end. There's enough ice cream throughout the museum that's included in your admission.2) Exhibits: It's more show than history, but the first room does give you a timeline of the history of ice cream. A few facts are thrown in throughout the space and a section about ice cream around the world.Each room is built for kids- a playground, a three-story slide, etc.- or Instagram influencers- pink everything, etc. There are five ice crema/popsicle stations with unlimited ice cream throughout. Come hungry.The winner was the pool of sprinkles. Adults and kids love it. We spent an hour there.3) Parking: It's NYC so street parking is hard to find. Come via the subway."
2027,h37t9rA06Sr4EetJjKrfzw,11/13/2022,5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I visited the Museum of Ice Cream and we had such an amazing time. We started off by making name tags for ourselves with ice cream related names and moved on to getting the first of many ice creams. The museum is full of aesthetically pleasing rooms perfect for photo ops. Not every room has ice cream you can try, but there are at least 5 different rooms with ice creams. Our favorite room was of course the sprinkle pool room. We ended up purchasing the sprinkle pool sundae online with our ticket, but we made the mistake of buying two thinking they wouldn't be that big. Our mistake. The sundaes were huge! It comes with 3 scoops of ice cream, whipped cream, toppings. We ended up just taking one of the sundae bowls home and just sharing one sundae together. I highly recommend this museum. It is a great spot to take your children or go on a date."

The first employee who let us in was super friendly and great at his job, he was full of energy. The rest of the staff were either just kinda doing their own thing and chatting amongst eachother. Minus one woman alone at an icecream stand by herself that seemed like she just wanted to go home. Cons- there were a lot of kids running around which wasnt great. The free icecream samples werent all that great.Pros- great photo opportunities with very aesthetic  rooms and lights. Unlimited samples of icecream and cotton candy. The sprinkle pool had an adult only one which was very cozy. Ultimate verdict was that it was fun for a one time trip but not worth the high ticket prices."

We even went down a slide that took us down to a different floor that was All pink, & with pink & white trees and they served cherry popsicles. I mean Almost every floor was PINK I enjoyed every second. A selfie person would definitely enjoy every bit of this place. I totally enjoyed the sprinkle pool, lots of fun! Can't wait to go back....."

We always look for some thing extra to do when we go into the city and I had stumbled across a video of this place on TikTok. I am so glad that I did. We made it there about 15 minutes before our reservation time and we still had a little bit of a line. When we got inside, the staff was incredible they were so helpful and sweet. They truly made the experience more enjoyable. What's not to love about this place unlimited ice cream included with your ticket purchase. I went during pinkmas so everything was pink and red and festive! Its room had its own fun little experience. Lots of opportunities for pictures. Lots of opportunities for multiple scoops of ice cream. Definitely a place that you want to go to with an empty stomach.!"

I hate it when I have to wave for the waitress. Some of them got attitude. Place usually is busy .

Get it with garlic sauce ( white sauce).  Overall, I give them 3 and 1/2 stars maybe even 4 stars."

The food came out pretty fast. They are always packed so should expect to wait before getting seated. Although I asked for a medium rare temperature they made it well done. The steak was well seasoned with full of flavor. The steak was big portion and the side was plentiful too. Overall, I am satisfied with my experience and would go there again to try out their other tasty dishes!"

2037,G5JtJcFcYD93tS8RHw60_g,6/6/2021,1 star rating,"This place has gone down the drain. I usually order 2-3 things from them when I do order but that won't be happening again. 1. The food is hit or miss. 2. They have the most ignorant, airhead waitresses I've ever seen in any place of business. 3. The unprofessionalism  on a scale of 1-10 is a 10.5. I've just never seen this type of behavior at an establishment before. It is really shocking. They cannot even answer the phones properly. 4. It does seem that the service is different based on what ethnicity you are. 5. The language barrier is a bit much. You should not pick up a phone speaking Spanish unless you have some way to identify that your callers are fluent Spanish speakers. Horrible, just horrible. I guess nothing will change with businesses that operate at this level until many people stop patronizing. Makes no damn sense!"

Going over it, we discovered why not providing an itemized bill in the first place. We were overcharged for the Mofongo and when questioned, the moron working at the register simply replied that that was what the computer said. When confronted with the actual menu and a totally different and way lowe price, he simply replied that he could show us on their payment management that the price was $16.95 and not the falsely advertised menu price of $11.95.I told him that they are ib the business to trick and fool people out of their hard earned cash and he did not even showed any concern or anything else to a point that we told him he was ""Robando"" to whomever ordered here.I waited a few weeks to see if, he was smart enough and re adjust the bill.m and he did not.I understand that, this is not a restaurant for a repeat visit for anyone due to their food being so bland and, the tremendous lack of hospitality. ""I'm simply judging based on my own experience and have not read any other reviews.""Beware when getting a simple receipt that only shows what the total is. Demand an itemized copy and thank me l8er."

As soon as you walk into the restaurant there is a huge smell of seafood that hits you in the face (heads up for anyone w/ seafood allergies), lucky I took a Benadryl just in case because my friends tend to forget my allergies.Anyways, you enter the restaurant and you will get hit with stares especially if you aren't Hispanic, which isn't a big issue but get ready to get stares from the workers and patrons in the place. We get table and before we sit of the servers clean the table for us, which was nice.After we get seated the waitress comes to get our order. She was super polite was a language barrier of course, I asked for a water and she look confused until I say 'agua' and she understood me. I ordered that skirt steak (med well) w/ rice and beans. I got the smallest steak out of everyone and it wasn't even cooked med well it was actually more along the lines of med rare, it could still see the bright red.  Overall the food was mediocre and not worth the price, in my opinion."

The Lil Stinker had slices of pepperonchini peppers that offered a very nice tangy crunch that really complimented the very savory flavors of the pizza sauce and the cheese. My only qualm with the pizzas were that, because the crust was so thin, it seemed to be weighed down by all the toppings and was borderline soggy. That is the only downside for me.

2072,6Hkw54Mnce_Owa1_7YJlwQ,7/29/2019,4 star rating,"Heard nothing but good things about Roberta's from my friend who had visited New York the week before I did, so I made it a point to stop by and see what the pizza was all about. This location is inside a food hall/food court-style place and can get pretty packed during peak hours, so seating might be tricky. My boyfriend and I didn't have an issue at around 6 PM though, so may not be too bad!We got two large pizzas to share. We got the Margherita and the Lil Stinker. The crust on these pizzas are on the thinner side. I usually prefer pizzas with a thicker crust, but these pizzas were GOOOD. The Margherita was as good as a margherita pizza can get. The Lil Stinker had slices of pepperonchini peppers that offered a very nice tangy crunch that really complimented the very savory flavors of the pizza sauce and the cheese. My only qualm with the pizzas were that, because the crust was so thin, it seemed to be weighed down by all the toppings and was borderline soggy. That is the only downside for me. Other than that, it was a delicious meal and I'd probably go back if I'm ever in the area again."

I ordered the Carnitas Yucatán ($26) - the pork was super tender and juicy, and the flavors of the corn cake, rice, and frijoles went really well with it. This is not bland food - salsa is fresh and flavorful, and the warm corn tortillas are slightly fluffy and a great vessel stuff with pork or other proteins and veggies to devour."

2077,SOgL0ctInPPr218E4vk90Q,12/13/2022,1 star rating,My team and I thought it would be nice to reserve a spot at this restaurant for a holiday dinner. Shit did we think wrong! We had reservations for over 2 weeks on a Tuesday at 6:15pm. We got there 5:50 and the hostess abruptly told us it would be ready at the time we reserved it for.6:15 rolls around and table isn't ready. Hostess tells us they're cleaning it and it will be ready in 5 mins. 5 mins goes by and she tells us her manager gave the table to somebody who didn't have a reservation?.... So another 10 goes by and she says the table is almost ready.Flash forward to 7:00 and we're finally seated. What a joke. Imagine if somebody on our team had to leave at a certain time? Come here if you love unprofessional service and snarky hostesses who have no problem not honoring reservations!
2078,SOgL0ctInPPr218E4vk90Q,10/31/2022,1 star rating,"I'll start by saying that we typically LOVE this restaurant for the food and atmosphere. However, my experience over the weekend was so awful that I needed to share. My boyfriend and I wanted to take our friends to Sinigual that were visiting from out of town because we love it so much. Three people in our group ordered fajitas. When our food came, the person who brought our food out fumbled the fajita cast iron (sizzling hot) onto our table. It landed on top of a martini glass, sending glass across the table and the cast iron skillet sliding towards me. My immediate reaction was to stop the plate from going further, therefor burning the finger tips of my entire right hand. I was in immediate pain, but didn't realize how bad it was until later that night when I couldn't bare my hand to be off of cold objects for more than 10 seconds at a time. Simultaneously, some part of the crash also landed on my boyfriends phone, shattering the glass screen protector. Now I know that accidents happen. And I think my group handled this in an extremely understanding manner. However, I was so disappointed on how the management handled the situation. Our server was extremely apologetic (she was not even around to witness the incident). Someone I assumed to be a manager came out to look at the situation as we were moving tables. Which, by the way, the entire table was not even cleared after shattering glass all over. Our drinks and other plates were transferred. One of my friends had glass in his dish and had to ask for a replacement.  I asked the manager for some cold water and informed him that my hand was burnt pretty badly. He brought out a cold towel and cold water and that was it. I didn't feel like he even gave an apology for the incident. Our server was the only one who seemed apologetic or concerned at all. I must have been naive to assume that even a drink or my meal in the very least would be compensated. We paid the entire $300 bill and headed straight to CVS to get pain medication and burn cream. Overall, I am just extremely disappointed with the level of professionalism and empathy of the majority of the staff that evening. It really puts a terrible taste in my mouth of a restaurant we once truly enjoyed."

They also have a $20 8 taco platter and a $22 sampler platter. Ally was our server and she was awesome. The tacos were small but good. One complaint is that the taco shells are so thin (which is normally good imo) but the sauce made them a bit flimsy. Nothing was overly spicy. When you sit they give you tortillas to have with salsa and honey butter which I thought was weird but was actually pretty tasty.The outdoor seating is nice but if you're too close to the door is a bit slanted to try to get closer to the middle of the block. Overall pretty good and definitely will be back on the weekends."

2085,Qm7m-xpt6wpiYkA2F2RLqg,8/29/2021,1 star rating,"This was just about the weirdest restaurant experience I've ever had. My friends had been here a couple times prior and had a pretty good time, remembered the food being tasty so we were pretty excited. The first weird thing that happened was when we were being seated one of the chefs walked by and whispered something that we couldn't hear to us. He walked away right after. We looked at the waitress and asked what that was about, she just said, ""oh he's so annoying."" Like what waitress says that about the chef in front of guests?  After being seated outside we ordered some appetizers, gyoza and seaweed salad. Pretty good stuff, then our first entree showed up. A crab avocado roll that my friend and I were splitting. The waitress brought it out with zero soy sauce and walked off before we could request some. I got up and asked her if we could have some for the roll and when she came back she just gave us the full bottle with no small bowls to put it in. Again, she walked away immediately giving us no time to ask for them. We thought, okay whatever, let's just eat the roll. The roll was great until the last piece which had zero avocado, straight wasabi spliced in with the crab. My friend started coughing and dry heaving because of it. It felt intentional, how does a sushi roller put mostly avocado into a roll and then stuff the end of it with wasabi? The waiter came out apologized for it and voided it. But then the light above our table went out and we were in the dark? They were able to get it on a couple minutes later but at this point we were so weirded out by the whole experience. Our entrees were brought to the table and we were excited to eat and get of there. Three of us got curry rice and one got the udon. Food itself was fine but the waiter mixed up one of the orders. We finished, paid and left. Soon after getting back to our apartment we all started feeling pretty awful. Clammy and nauseous. We all felt this way for multiple hours. I don't know what was in the food but we felt ill. I've never felt compelled to leave a review till now. The weird chef whispering to us as we sat down. The waiters seemed to not care much at all about our experience as guests. The sushi spliced with wasabi inside of it. The light going out. And the sickness we all felt after leaving. I used to like this place, but this was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had."

I spent about 5 minutes in the bathroom trying to open the door because it was stuck, and when I came out, it was to weird looks from the staff. My girlfriend had a terrible stomachache that night and we hadn't eaten anything else that day. The wait staff also gave us attitude the whole time.

My friend also ordered sake which they brought on ice in a Japanese style bucket. Like Vegas style HA! Love cute details. Miso was good, my rainbow roll was standard.Here's where things got weird- I wanted the sashimi platter (which is what I ALWAYS order from sushi restaurants), and kindly requested the substitute the white fish for something else. The platter then comes out with TEN pieces of salmon and two tuna.... I was like wait what??? Why would anyone order a sashimi platter if they wanted a huge plate of salmon with some tuna on the side?! I then kindly requested they replace at least two of the salmon with, say, yellowtail. Nope because MP is higher, yet on the alacarte menu it's the same price. Ok that makes no sense but fine. I ask which specialty rolls I can add cream cheese to... ""none"". Uhhh not true, this isn't my first time eating sushi LOL. I order a rainbow roll and they bring it out with little cubes of cream cheese on each roll. Thanks for trying.My friend ordered the chicken and said it not only looked weird but tasted weird. I'm thinking ok it can't be that bad... she doesn't touch it and then proceeds to PROJECTILE VOMIT multiple times the second we leave. Like no joke at all."

2091,Qm7m-xpt6wpiYkA2F2RLqg,9/16/2019,3 star rating,"I guess this place will suffice if you're ever in the East Village area and craving inexpensive Japanese food. Honestly, their menu was an eyesore to look at and they should definitely have it redesigned. After spending about 10-15 minutes looking through the menu, I had their pork katsu since I heard good things about their curry. My party and I also split an order of spicy tuna and shrimp sushi rolls. I thought my pork katsu dish was overly dry and somewhat bland. Sitting in front of their Dyson fan really didn't help with the dryness of the meat. The sauce that they provided definitely helped with the blandness, but I can only add so much on the cutlets before it becomes way too salty. The sushi rolls were pretty standard and there was really nothing much to brag about.The staff were accommodating and catered to our needs. They also offer tatami floor seating here if you're a fan of that. I haven't tried their other offerings here, but I'd shy away from the katsu curry dishes. Brownie points for them for providing warm towels for cleaning our hands before dining."

Wish there was a can version of this sold somewhere else. My friend and I shared the Woodbines Chili Cheese Nachos which were great! We also got the Chocolate Lava Cake which was good too.

The burgers we received though were really fresh, including the fries, so not going to complain about the wait. Both burgers were of good size and came with a huge portion of fries that were hard to finish (of course I did though). I thought the meat itself could have been seasoned a bit more though, which I thought was definitely lacking at least some salt. Price ($17) was a little on the high end for a burger, but since the portion was large I don't mind that much either. Overall, a solid burger in LIC and one I would return for once I get the craving again."

I got a southwest breakfast burrito, made vegetarian, and it was filled with PLAIN & UNSEASONED white rice and barely any vegetables in lieu of the meat that was originally in there. It was absolutely awful. Next, the service was terrible - we had to ask multiple times just to get WATER and GLASSES for our table and one of our friends had to ask multiple times for their diet coke. When we did ask for water, the waitress almost made it seem like such a daunting task for her to get us the bare minimum of water! The two stars are for the fried pickles and the frose which were both OK, and the cajun fries, which were the best things we ordered on the menu.

I started with the labneh, which was meticulously coated in zaatar and was quite pleasing to the palette. As part of the lunch special, I chose the shakshuka hummus, which was tasty, although it didn't have that inexplicable richness which I have found the highest-quality hummuses to possess. I think it might have been due to the interaction with the shakshuka sauce, which to be honest was overpowering.My friend who dined with me ordered the sabich hummus, which I ended up being quite envious of. The roasted eggplant was incredibly tender, and drew out the best in the hummus' flavor."

The kitchen is open and the food is made right in front of your eyes!I love this place so much that when my work had a conference in town and looked for a place to take us all, my first choice was hummus market.Needless to say our experience was amazing, we got our food fast (even though the place is relatively small and we were a large group of 20 people), it was all delicious and I got praises from my colleagues for bringing us here.I recommend the Fatoush salad, shakshuka (tomato and egg stew), amazing majadra (rice with lentils) and of course, the hummus.Don't hesitate and go there!"

2112,YuzOnNDfRKixNJiaVy5Baw,8/22/2020,5 star rating,"I may have found it. My favorite hummus in NYC.I'm very particular about the type of hummus I like. My ideal hummus is smooth, creamy and full of tahini flavor (not into the super thick kinds that may still have some chickpea chunks in it). And that's exactly the kind of hummus you'll find at Hummus Market. It's almost too thin for hummus - that's how thin it is - but it's just right as a dip to be scooped up by the pita and the flavor is delicious. My favorite is the sabich hummus cuz I love the eggplant mixed into the hummus.I would be remiss to not mention their deliciously fluffy pita, which are perfect for scooping up the hummus. I always get more than the default because that's how much I love their pita.I tried a sabich stuffed pita and this was a weird case where I definitely prefer the components separately rather than combined together. Somehow the components aren't as well balanced in the sabich sandwich as say the version from Taim. Like the pita is just a bit too thick / fluffy, and the entire thing just feels much too heavy when in a stuffed form. But all the components individually are incredible."

You're one of the good ones.Your kimchi pancake is always solid, and that cheese/chicken/gochujang concoction is surprisingly tasty. In terms of soju, well, how could you not deliver on the thing you're named after? I love your cucumber/chili pepper-infused soju cocktail that easily serves three. It's refreshing, it's green, it's just perfect year-round. In terms of ambience, you could stand to be a bit quieter after 8pm, but I also get that people come to you to worship at the altar of soju.

We got the savory kimchi pancake ($16.95) and the spicy rice cakes with fried squid ($17.95), which were both just fine and pretty pricey. The drinks are pretty expensive. The cucumber soju was $29.95 for I believe 30 oz, and it was refreshing but sweeter and less strong than expected."

While they have an extensive drink menu, we did not get any drinks because we were mainly looking to satisfy our midnight cravings.  We got the Spicy Chicken+Cheese. THIS REALLY HIT THE SPOT. It tasted straight out of Korea-- which was exactly what I needed. As a cheese lover, the amount of cheese on the dish was just the right amount and I felt the portion size and price was decent for New York. The dish appeared not spicy enough at first, but the heat definitely came up later.Would love to come back here again and try other things on their menu!"

I would've just paid $12 for that instead of $30 for this one, especially because it only poured 5 shots.

Vibes: we sat outside, it's a bit scary cuz u r pretty much sitting next to the road but with covered. But it's a cool experience though, just like u are in Korea!Pork soup with kimchi is so yum, pork bones cooked very well with perfect seasoned. Very soft and not dry at all!I was more surprised that we ordered extra rice and it came with rice with egg, and this is not just plain, non seasoned rice, it actually mixed with dried fishes!"
2120,YuzOnNDfRKixNJiaVy5Baw,1/10/2022,3 star rating,"Sorry but why does everyone like this place so much? I've been here twice now, and probably will have to come back since my friends do enjoy this.They only take cash or AMEX so be prepared.I've dined outside during COVID and inside. Don't love the stools - I hate chairs with backs.FRIED CHICKEN - Decent.SEAFOOD PANCAKE - Decent.Those are the only 2 dishes I like. The frozen beer is cool too, I guess.KIMCHI PANCAKE is mediocre. We usually also get some sort of STEW that is usually too spicy for me. Slash the only flavor is spice! Free rice ball per person before 8PM btw. I'll give them an extra star for that. Anyway, very much a family style place. I would never pick this place to go to, but I already know others will so I'll be back."
2121,YuzOnNDfRKixNJiaVy5Baw,8/7/2022,5 star rating,"Better ambience and mood than its predecessor, 3rd floor. The korean food is authentic and well portioned. My colleague and I thoroughly enjoyed good traditional Korean fare here.  We had spicy pork galbi, a few pancakes, bossam, and drinks. Bossam didnt have the fermented lettuce but the pork was well cooked.  Naenmyun is a street style noodle so its not traditional bi-naeng or mul-naeng but still authentic to what I used to have in Korea which made me happy. FYI they take Amex but not Visa."
2122,YuzOnNDfRKixNJiaVy5Baw,1/10/2022,4 star rating,"Food 4/5The kimchi pancake was a little flavorless, but the kimchi fried rice and the mild seafood soup were very heart-warming and satisfying. We didn't order any soju because they were priced quite high, unfortunately. There was something weird in the seafood soup that kind of looked like mini-brains?? But when you bit into it it would pop and liquid would come out and it tasted kind of bitter. Still don't know what they are to this day... Anyway, the menu had so many different dishes I wanted to try them all, so I'll have to come back to try! Interior 5/5Loved the design of the menu, the tall ceilings, and unique lighting were definitely a plus. I really like how the restaurant feels more upscale and serves very good Korean food at the same time. Service 4/5Friendly waiter, not much to say."

For 2 people we got the broccoli in brown sauce, boneless spare ribs and order of white rice. Great amount to share. Plus freshly made chicken wings as appetizers. Definitely recommend it."
2125,1nR3kKOs938gcgnw6p5wjg,12/19/2017,2 star rating,The food quality is a little better than a take-out restaurant but not the price.  They try to get a little fancy and charge you a little more but not worth it.  I ordered the beef pan fried noodle and it was drenched in sauce and big cut vegetables with 4 pieces of beef.  The noodles were some cheap quality.  Not recommended.
2126,1nR3kKOs938gcgnw6p5wjg,8/8/2019,4 star rating,Good spot for quick carry out. It's the go to spot during lunch. Super clean and the employees are nice. Good for take out or eating in.

But relatively speaking when thinking of similar take out Chinese restaurants, Taste Kitchen is above average. I had General Tso's Chicken, and it was quite delicious. Had the nice crunch that I expect in General Tso's, good flavor, good portion size. I was satisfied. Service is also friendly here. They have several tables available for dine in as well. Overall, a solid New York Chinese take out option."

2130,1nR3kKOs938gcgnw6p5wjg,12/11/2017,2 star rating,Ordered delivery from a hotel. The delivery man called me screaming and was very angry. He couldn't wait for me to get down to the lobby and ended up leaving and coming back frantically screaming at me that he was very busy and couldn't believe how terrible I was. The food was not great. The broccoli with garlic sauce was very greasy. The vegetable lo mein was good though.
2131,1nR3kKOs938gcgnw6p5wjg,11/30/2017,1 star rating,"The delivery person was extremely rude. Came into the theater I work at yelling. The instructions said to bring down to the receptionist. He was mad because our phone number has a recording with instructions he didn't want to listen to, so he didn't know to press zero. He yelled at me and kept shoving his phone in my face. You do not come into a public place of business yelling. He yelled at me and the people in the box office. We have a company here in rehearsal. Completely unacceptable. I will never order from here again."

Don't remember the specifics of what we ate, except that small plates kept coming and we loved them all.

Stopped into Stafili Wine Cafe on one of my many walks and instantly felt at home. I have never been greeted so warmly. I planned on having a quick glass of wine and ended up staying for a bottle. The atmosphere is wonderful, the staff is fantastic and the vibe is exactly what I was looking forward to experiencing on my NYC return. I can't wait to try everything on the menu! This will always be on my agenda for all of my future visits."
2142,1en3taVtoDPgtEDWHrFeog,3/24/2021,5 star rating,This is an absolute gem of a spot. This is an adorable wine cafe that is really well thought out. The crépes are delicious and the arugula salad was amazing. Great hospitality by Chris! (The bathroom was amazing). The ceiling was lined with corks and it was an extremely warm and pleasant environment. One of those spots that make you feel welcomed as soon as you walk in the door.I stopped in for a bite and a cup of coffee. Honestly some of the best coffee I've had. I can't wait for the pandemic to start easing up so this place can get busy. Going to make this one of my go to spots. Definitely going to be a date night spot for sure!   You must check this place out!

No consistent server it took 25 min for us to order. I was here on Christmas alone I came at 11:30am for croque monsieur and to write in my journal and the bartender was blasting jingle bells or whatever. Like max volume. I was like hey can u just lower it a little I have bad tinnitus. (not even my noise cancellation was doing the job) and he's like ""IM WORKING ON CHRISTMAS LET ME ENJOY MY TIME"" I remember saying - ""key word- WORKING. I'm also hosting tonight on Christmas, congrats."" He was so rude. The food is good (drinks only 7/10) but just be aware of the pretentious vibes on certain days.

2147,Hp1ZDTeJOP1NrY2aFtROgQ,4/22/2021,1 star rating,Not a great experience. Service is lacking and management seems to chuckle at serious questions. They close at anytime they choose so don't rely on their hours posted. Food is average here it was not worth the wait: call this a lay resort spot. Choose other places
2148,Hp1ZDTeJOP1NrY2aFtROgQ,1/2/2023,5 star rating,This place is a gem. We dropped in wile on a walk and enjoyed an espresso at the bar. We were surprised by the reasonable prices. The staff was friendly.
2149,Hp1ZDTeJOP1NrY2aFtROgQ,5/30/2021,2 star rating,"I really dislike giving negative reviews, but this place really disappointed me. Firstly, after taking our order we waited over an hour to get our food.When the food arrived, it was lukewarm.I ordered the hangar steak and it was very subpar - too chewy to enjoy. The escargot was fine, but not the most flavourful. According to my friends, the Zucchini chips were absolutely delicious. I did not try them as I am GF. Finally, at the end of the meal there was a complication with the bill. My friend who booked the reservation had to put down a $20 per person fee in advance, which was supposed to be put towards the meal. When the bill arrived it had not been deducted and had my friend not spoken up, the waiter wouldn't have taken the money off.  This in itself was a big ordeal as the waiter had to go back into the kitchen for a while to figure out how to take the money off the bill. This is my second time at Cafe Select and unfortunately I don't think I will be returning."

Asked for an iced tea which was just water with lemon juice. Told said waiter (JP) who began to ARGUE with us and say it was just the ice that melted. After the check came, gave us the wrong bill. When the right bill came, after having to stand up and flag JP down, I noticed one of the drinks was incorrectly rung in. The drink rung in was more expensive than the one we ordered.Entree was good. That's if."
2151,Hp1ZDTeJOP1NrY2aFtROgQ,9/27/2021,1 star rating,"The people that work here have the absolute worst attitudes!! They should definitely not be working in the service industry they obviously hate their jobs lol.I came here on a Friday night 9/14 around 9pm with 4 of my friends and when we first walked up we saw a bunch of tables open, there were like 7 different tables open that were set and no one was sitting there, so we thought great there's open seats let's eat here, and sat down at a table. We were there for awhile and no one had come by, but we were busy looking at the drink menu anyways and when we were about to order a lady, maybe a hostess, came up to us furiously and yelled at us about sitting down. We told her we saw all the empty tables and thought they were open and apologized. She yelled at us with sooo much attitude about needing to check in and gave us these awful laser eyes and basically insinuated we were idiots for not knowing to check in. There's literally no where that says you have to check in by the door or people outside to tell anyone that and there were so many empty seats, it definitely was not a given on how we were supposed to approach sitting down. We would have been happy to check in if the hostess/waiter chick wasn't such a freakin awful bitch to us and had just asked us nicely. In any case out of curiosity I went to the other hostesses inside and asked if we could sit down ~ they scoffed at us for not having a reservation. But when I turned back around there were still at least 6 different tables still empty lol.Seemed like these girls working spent too much time watching TikTok makeup tutorials and not enough time learning how to do their job and treat customers with respect. Staying far away from this restaurant for sure."

I did so thinking it was a done deal and I had it locked in. Called two days before the event (today) and they said they aren't able to do it for me.Waitress on the phone gave stank attitude and lacked full accountability.This place already has low stars.

Old school NYC Italian joint, small bar and surprisingly large dining rooms. Place was packed with every table taken and at least 5-6 tables of 7/8 plus. Service was excellent, waiters all very attentive and friendly. Unfortunately the food wasn't very good at all. Appetizers were small and mediocre, plates were kind of thrown together. I ordered beef braciola special as it sounded really good when the waiter mentioned it. Beef was really dry, kind of fell apart on my plate. Came with a side of rigatoni that was either undercooked or had been sitting for a long time. Marinara had a strange taste and texture. My coworkers said their entrees were below average. I wouldn't go back. Only positive was the desert plate with cannolis and Italian cheesecake. Someone also ordered 2 bowls of what was supposed to be gelato but was a spot on imitation of Breyer's vanilla."

We brought the family to NYC for the first time and Rossini's was across the street from our hotel. What a find!  The inside is what you think of when you think old school NY Italian restaurant. In the hallway between the bar and the dining area, there were pictures of celebrities who have been there. Lots of guys from gangster movies. Helps add to the vibe. My daughter swore there was probably a gun taped behind the toilet. The food was phenomenal. I ordered veal in a butter, lemon, and white wine sauce. So tender and flavorful. My wife ordered a special pasta of the night and it was incredible. My daughter ordered the fettuccine Alfredo, and it was probably the best I've ever had. My son ordered the lamb chops, and they were perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection. The wait staff was all tuxedoed and could not have been more attentive. Glasses never got empty, used plates never lingered, and everything was handled with grace and professionalism. I can't think of a finer experience I've ever had at an Italian restaurant. Truly a gem, and you should definitely check it out. Bravo."

They stack them on the table and take each layer off after each guests. My food: fried calamari and seafood risotto"
2162,47J3jLkclOMXExoPoIpnag,2/27/2020,4 star rating,Very good traditional Italian restaurant. My husband's been here with buddies who grew up coming here. Tried the scungilli ( not sure about the spelling ) but it's basically conch sliced thinly and served in spicy tomato sauce . Awesome appetizer but it wasn't on the menu - had to ask for it. The veal Rossini was amazing - tender and flavorful and my favorite. We also had the veal chop which was nice and tender but not as flavorful as the other dishes we had that meal. We had the chocolate torte for dessert- good but not great. The decaf cappuccino was smooth and delicious.

While their prices are a bit higher, as is their food quality; but almost $2 for a small bag of crispy noodles; come on!"

Well, I'm confined in a post-illness rehab facility in the area and gave it another chance. I had the crispy orange chicken and it was one of the best things I've ever had. Beautiful chunks of white meat chicken in a rich orange sauce, not overly sweet but just right. A huge portion, enough for two or three people, and call me crazy but I love dipping it in the fresh hot mustard for a little extra zip. Quick and efficient delivery, a follow-up call from the restaurant and an overall great experience. I'll be ordering from them again."

The layout consists of a few tables and chairs filling the room. Please note they did not check vaccination cards or require masks. There was also no wait on a weekend.We had a waitress approach us very quickly. She was on a mission through every encounter to ensure there was no dilly daggling. It was nice, but also felt rushed and staff throughout the restaurant would just yell at each other. Quite noisy. We had the calamari, lobster bisque, the spicy crab corn chowder, cherry stones and beer. The best was the crab corn chowder. The cherry stones lacked flavor even with the sauce and the calamari was just good. I longed for more but was not impressed with what I already had to dare get more.

I do insist on sitting at the counter so as to be able to chat with one of my favorite chef/servers. Their ""hot shrimp"" is to die for if you can handle the heat; otherwise, you can have it ""mild"" as well. All the soups & salads are fresh & delicious. Nearly every item on menu I've had over the many years coming here has been absolutely gorgeously delicious. I can't thank them enough for staying in business over the course of my lifetime & staying such a reliable go-to spot for satisfying meals!"

Headed out to Sheepshead Bay and I am glad I did (note: will def be back in the Summer for the full beach experience).Randazzo's is a no BS red sauce Italian American joint. The seafood was very fresh. We went with combo app (mussels, shrimp, calamari and scungili), steamed calamari and the epic fra diavolo. And of course took a advantage of the homemade spicy red sauce. Slipped a few Peronis in for good measure. Service quick. Servers friendly. Atmosphere homey. I cannot wait to come back. The only problem is how far it is. Otherwise, I'd live at the counter. Sick spot."
2182,t8pXwUbWFnRFtFeU9oS-vw,1/1/2023,5 star rating,"Let's talk about seafood. Better yet, let's talk about Italian American seafood! Gala ma, scungeel, clams, shrimps, lobstah and Sauce; mild, medium and hot. Randazzos is the spot for all that. Forget New England Style Lobster Bisque or Lobster Rolls or Maryland crab cakes...not their specialty. At Randazzo's to start you get baked clams, preferably little necks, perfectly crisp, garlicky in a wonderful broth. Then, Linguine with clam sauce. Not the joke you get in the City, all pasta with 4 clams in shells. Here you get a big beautiful portion, perfect garlicky white sauce loaded with herbs and clams. Then you move onto the incredible and not well known Burned Chicken, a Scarpariella  really, gorgeously browned and the sauce is perfection. Get it with their fried zucchini, a huge perfect portion. Then, the combo, all in Medium sauce. That sauce! Wow. The seafood is sublime, sweet lil shrimp, crispy calamari and mussels. Or, get the lobster fra d'iavolo or Zuppa di pesce! An absolute seafood feast here and prices are a steal. Go! Now! These authentic old New York Italian Americans are disappearing. CASH ONLY"

Their RW dinner menu is $60, the same price with their dinner prix fixe menu, but the prix fixe one has more options, though not including all the options in RW menu. The food overall was delicious! My favorite was the escagorts. The award-winning french onion soup burger was pretty interesting, very new. The least favorite dish for me would be the chocolate molten cake as I was expecting some melted chocolate filling but didn't get it. They have live piano performance late at night; pretty nice vibe in general. Very good service as well!"

I understand the need to raise prices but don't shrink the portions.  Also they must have a new chef bc the beef borg (3 smallPieces for $42) was not as tasty as it usually is, the broth was thin and no onions or mushrooms.  Sadly to say, we were disappointed and won't be back.Edit: please see the picture for the tacky response from the owner! Disgusting!!!Edit #2 - The classless owner cannot take honest feedback and continues to write/send rude comments. I have been going to your place for years but because of your arrogant attitude, we will never be back nor will any of our many friends that we have taken there and as you said ""thanks, but no thanks."""

Salads are fresh, the escargot is scrumptious . I can't say enough about the French onion soup it's  out-of-this-world. We generally go for the duck or the lamb chops; pay attention to the specials, they are always worth it. Meals are served with a carrot ginger purée, spinach and mashed potato, you won't be disappointed. Don't forget to save room for desert."
2188,Cyv-tW4BljwWnP16HI_zAg,5/19/2022,3 star rating,"With an extensive menu of classics, Le Rivage offers what many will be looking for at a French pre-theater restaurant: Coq au Vin, escargot, frogs legs, beef bourguignon, ratatouille. We found the food to be tasty, Three stars due to the slightly chilly overall atmosphere, very tight tables, efficient but visibly pressured wait staff - this isn't a relaxing meal before your show, it's a French food assembly line. Plates were served too hot to touch - not the food, the plates - mandatory $60pp fixed price with no option for a la carte before 7:30pm. As lifelong New Yorkers we won't be going back, but located in the heart of the district, Le Rivage is fine for theater-goers willing to drop $80 for a French meal."

2191,Cyv-tW4BljwWnP16HI_zAg,10/25/2022,5 star rating,OMG I cannot explain how romantic and cozy this place is..! Other than food and delicious desserts this place is warm and cozy with great service. I have enjoyed my steak and the night ended with a wonderful taste of chocolate dessert. The night we walked in this place it was raining outside and the warmth of the place with a light french music made our night. We really enjoyed eating in this place and highly recommended for the steak lovers...
2192,Cyv-tW4BljwWnP16HI_zAg,5/13/2022,3 star rating,"First, it is clear that La Rivage has experience herding the pre-theater crowd in and out. We arrived around 5:15pm, and the restaurant was fairly crowded. Also, the staff were very good about asking about showtimes and managing the logistics of a well-timed departure.Based on the crowd, I'm guessing many customers have faith in their ability to do this.The menu is limited to a three-course fixed-price menu during the pre- and post-theater rushes. I imagine in the interest of keeping the machinery running. There is a nice variety of choices and surcharges for those higher-valued entrées such as lamb chops or duck (I think).We had paté de campagne  and a green salad for the starter. Steak frites and coq au vin for the main course. For dessert it was sorbet and a fruit plate. All servings were of a nice size and I thought the fruit was particularly fresh. Everything else was overall fine. I did keep revisiting the coq au vin in my mind and the assembly line operation though. I wondered how long the coq au vin had been left in the oven for a slow cook. The vegetables and the chicken were just not as tender as I'm accustomed, so that was the only shortcoming I could identify.Service was fine with bread refilled and water glasses frequently refilled. Also, the manager made several check-ins. She is delightfully charming and added to the existing ambiance of a family-owned French restaurant.In addition to the three-course menu, we had three glasses of wine. Total price with 20% tip was $207.  The wines were ok, but I think the quality/price equation was slightly better after a recent visit to Le Privé (a little further over in Hell's Kitchen).I think the value is OK, but we aren't excited for a revisit. However, obviously, this is only my opinion. The restaurant seems to do a really good business, so we are more in the minority on this one, I think. If you want to make sure you make your Broadway show on time and looking for a fully belly, I think this is a safe dinner choice and would be much better than lots of the Times Square tourist traps."

My favorite is the halal pepperoni and sausage."

I did also try their regular margharita slice, and I was not a fan. It actually took away from my experience with the 1st vegan slice. Their vegan pizza crust was crispier and slightly thinner.

Ordered a 14 inch pepperoni and sausage for lunch pickup today and it was $17 which I would have thought was reasonable had it not tasted truly like dollar slice. It was the quintessential dollar slice crust - soft and sweet. Toppings were generous and the sauce and cheese were okay, but nothing to write home about. It just tasted like very cheap pizza.Pickup was easy - it was ready when I got there and was fast. It was still super hot when I picked it up and reheated well when I got home. All in all, totally edible but pretty bad quality. I would have opted for a frozen pizza over this."

2200,--FoSeUBHQb_p6iTntY4KA,6/30/2020,5 star rating,"This is great. One of the best here in New York. When you find a pizza that is good, warm and fresh, it is something you want to sit with for some time. To have it delivered in front of you. A slice that you can look at and then take a bite out of. It can be a cheese pizza. It can be something a bit more combined with spinach, cheese, garlic, olive oil and some sauce. There is a good fresh combination to choose from.This is why a new place is ArtisticPizzaNYC. You will find the only shop on West 3rd Street in the village in New York. Founded just over a year ago (before everything happened in today's world), ArtisticPizzaNYC has been in the small shop located behind Washington Square Park and just off of 6th Avenue. The chief chef - Sagor - is one of the friendliest pizza chefs in the city. He meets you when you walk in, and talks to you not only the pizza he has there but also new slices you might want to try.It is better than most pizza shops here in New York, or anywhere. When you listen and then decide, everything is possible. Today, we ordered a few slices to try. We started with a traditional Cheese slice. We then asked for a Mushroom and Spinach slice that included cheese and a light tomato sauce. This was then followed with an all White slice of mozzarella cheese and a white sauce. There was no tomato sauce or anything else. Then, to include a bit more, we had an all Vegan slice of Mushroom and cheese. But, things did not stop there. The last slice they offered was a traditional Margarita slice with fresh tomatoes, fresh basil, and fresh mozzarella. That is it.ArtisticPizzaNYC. It is a small shop with a great (small) team. They were excellent. I tasted a good share of the product and we liked being there. In fact, next time we are in their neighborhood, we shall go back to ArtisticPizzaNYC for a few new slices, and a soft drink, while speaking with the team. The shop was great. We really liked it."

I ordered the Chicken & ranch which included cauliflower vegan crust, vegan chicken, vegan ranch, vegan moz cheese, house made tomato sauce plus I added basil which I highly recommend it added a lot in my opinion. Also rated a 4/5 because it was yummy but I needed gluten free and I couldn't order a slice so I had to get a whole pizza which wasn't a big deal since if I'm being honest I ate over half anyways  Located just around the corner from Washington square park so we ate by the arch and fountain!"

My wife's rice ball lacked cheese around it, as last time, which she had loved. Pizza was cold. My sandwich lacked the lettuce and tomato that I had requested, and had received the previous time. Pepperoni on a sandwich was tiny pepperoni pizza slices,  not designed to make a decent Italian sandwich."

Now its just your standard run of the mill pizza joint taken on by Mexicans. With the extraction of the Italians, the pizza crust, sauce and over all experience has dwindled. It is better than your standard dominoes, pizza hut or local chicken spot pizza but if you want good Pizza, just go to Aldo's on Pitkin and Crossbay."

2218,o2SAcKbfOMkA71xUfyee6Q,9/12/2022,3 star rating,"We decided to give this place a try after reading the reviews. We got here real early right after they opened and got immediately seated. We were given a choice of whether to sit between diners or by the window. I didn't feel like sitting by the window in case someone decided to cough as they walk by. So, I opted to sit between diners. The restaurant is about the size of a one-story house, with white floors and dark walls. Across from the entrance is a counter that directly faces the kitchen. Wine glasses and bottles hang above the counter while behind the counter sits an elaborate coffee machine. Tables line both the middle and back of the restaurant and next to the back tables is yet another selection of wine.We ordered Suppli, which has 3 Roman style risotto balls. We decided to do  one of each, which were classico, Cacio e Pepe, daily special. The daily special was leek and taleggio. They were ok but would've liked the portions to be bigger. There was too much crunch instead. Next, we ordered 3 trapizzinis. The first one was parmigiana di melanzane, which has roasted eggplant, tomato, parmigiana, basil. We liked it and thought it was very flavorful. The olive oil was strong. Daughter doesn't remember much of this one. It's probably because she didn't like it. LOLThe second trapizzini was polpetta al sugo, which is nonna's beef meatball and tomato sauce. This was hubs' least favorite of the 3. He said it tasted like a hunk of meat with some sauce. This was daughter's order and she also thought it could've been better. It wasn't as soft as she was hoping it would be. She liked the Doppia panna better. The third trapizzini that we ordered was Doppia panna, which has stracciatella di burrata and anchovies. This was easily the best one. It was nice, meaty and salty. The bread part of the trapizzinis was nice and soft, though. It's the fillings in them that needed a little bit of help. Service was friendly and quick. Will probably return when in the area to try more items from the menu."

Trapizzino is a small but super cute and well decorated spot with a menu that in my opinion encourages you to try lots of things. The prices are very fair, and allow a group to do a mix of starters and then get their own trapizzini (filled homemade bread pocket) and not go overboard with spending. Their cocktails were delicious too, I highly recommend the bicicletta which was light and refreshing. Dessert was also delicious and service was great. I will absolutely be back to try more!!"

Our very nice server immediately greets us with a smile and recommendations. I planned on getting a beer but noticed they had an espresso martini so I obliged. Their espresso martini is garnished with a cinnamon which is the extra tang that is needed on the top of the tongue. We shared the kale salad ( just okay, the kale was a little harsh BUT the anchovy breadcrumbs were a hit), the risotto balls (classic I loved and the leek was too dense for my taste), the fried artichokes ( wouldn't recommend not bad but not good). I got the oxtail pizza pocket which was soooooo yummy. The Meat was tender and the star of this dish was the BREAD. The bread melted in your mouth and you can even eat two without being too full. I'll def be back to try a few other items."

Honestly, the food wasn't all that bad, but it was really the prices. Fries were okay, same kind of fries I'd get at a deli for $3, they charged $5.50! Same with the buffalo chicken; same quality I'd get at a deli for $6, they charged $10.95! I basically spend $17-18 for same quality of meal that I would have received at a corner deli for half the price. I would have thought that they would be providing higher quality food for those prices. Definitely learned my lesson with this place."

We went down and didnt find him so called him again. And he started yelling at us.2. The tenders that we ordered were soaked in the buffalo sauce made them non appealing and inedible at all. 3.  They totally missed the macaroni salad that we ordered.It is a horrible horrible experience ordering from this place.

The menu offered a variety of options and sauces, but I decided to go with the Garlic Parmesan wings. As for the sauce - the garlic Parmesan a little different than your standard iteration of this sauce. Its pretty much just a more garlicky version of the hot buffalo. It was, however very good. A nice mix of heat and flavor.The wings themselves were a little disappointing. They came somewhat soggy and were probably the greasiest wings I've ever had. Not bad by any means, but weren't the best either. Decent sized which was appreciated. Overall, a decent experience and I think I would order from them again. As far as quality goes, I'd say they're about equal to Atomic, but come A LOT quicker."

When I finally received my food there was a bug cooked into my chicken. So repulsive, I almost threw up. I called them immediately and told what happen and all they said was they were sorry. I had to ask for my money back, they didn't even offer. I will never order from this place again. The only reason why they received a one star rating from me is because I have to select it before posting."
2242,rlp1_EyRynmIDlJClhRNlQ,1/3/2018,2 star rating,"First of all when I open the door, the first words out your trap shouldn't be ""already wait 15mins downstairs"" I don't know if that's true, I only know when my doorman buzzed me. Secondly, your reasoning for yelling shouldn't be ""well I was calling you to come downstairs"" what if I was handicapped or elderly? It's DELIVERY for a reason- not call and I'll meet you outside. All this and you werent even calling the correct phone number. Third, anytime I've dined in the restaurant, the dudebro manager (he's the one with the necklace of beads as a bracelet and wearing sunglasses indoors 24/7) is always yelling at his staff, deeming them incompetent over register duties and blaming his delivery men for tickets he gets bc of them not wearing proper NYC requirements. If you trained staff properly (ie, without sunglasses on) or you make sure staff leaves the store with their tags on... mayyyybe you'd have a better business."

The windows and floor appear to be always dirty. The teenagers that work there try to overcharge. I said try cause you have to watch how and what they ring up and your change back. It may not seem much but add it up over all the customers per day it does. Especially if you buy a large sundae. The cup is half full then they start putting the toppings on. Their only plus is that this is the only Carvel for miles. The customers get tired and don't come back. Some of the people working there are great but it's hit and miss. Be on your toes when you go there. Their ice cream hits the spot.

Whoever mentioned that they have two different price lists is correct. The owners need an attitude adjustment and are grunting and rushing you the entire time. It's unfortunate that the community gives them the business because they don't deserve it and are robbing us w zero customer service. Save yourself the money and bad mood and go to another carvel or even baskin robbins down the block.

They've got two different price schedules which are confusing. They told me choose 1-5 on one schedule. When I got the bill they pointed to another price schedule 1-3 . It said at the bottom of that one $1.00 for each topping. The ice cream is good. Not $7.00 good"

2253,sY5j4zQuWRGxHG6T7EunrQ,7/29/2022,1 star rating,"Poor Customer Service/Snob Management...I rarely share my experience on a restaurant, since restaurant business is a tough business and it's almost impossible to please everyone, but my experience at Cipriani was just fine until the last moment, when the manager came to our table at the end of the night with a nasty/very rude attitude. Long story short, I asked our host, if I can purchase two used & invaluable glasses of wine, since a young individual within our group wanted to take them home as a memory. He shared our request with the manager & he showed up at our table, took the two glasses and with a very rude manner said you wanna buy them, they're $25 each, which I responded back with okay!!! He left & never came back with the glasses. I'm not sure where this behavior came from, but when you spend this kind of money on Italian food at a restaurant that think they're the best, a simple answer like sorry we don't do this would be more appropriate. I don't know where the restaurant business is heading, but this kind of looking down/talking down to a costumer should not be acceptable by the restaurant owners and the industry. Good luck with promoting poor customer service..."

Great classic dishes, Bellinis and wine....The carpaccio, remains in its own league. The spaghetti with branzino (and all of the pastas for that matter) is not to be missed. The out-of-this-world filet mignon, despite an outrageous-sounding $75 price, is worth the splurge. Welcome back, Harry Cipriani (and Sergio)!

After getting a table, waited for 10 mins to be served. No water, no menu, nothing. In a meantime, someone else came after us and sat down at the next table. He was promptly served. His companion who joined him soon after, was also promptly served. Kept trying to meet the eyes of the server. After waiting for another 2 mins, we walked out. I'm not trying to play a race card but we're Asians. The couple at the next table were Caucasians. Disgusting."

First of all, the atmosphere is so dated and I felt like I was on a cruise ship in the 1980s. Our waitstaff and servers were lovely, however, a different person came to our table every single time, so it was a bit confusing. I think it's so strange that they prepare every dish table side. Some tables who ordered pasta received the entire portion, but for some reason they did not give us the entire plate that they mixed together next to the table. Obviously I knew that the menu would be pricy, but I did not expect for the portions to be so small, under seasoned, and underwhelming. We received completely uncooked rice, twice, and were told ""that's how they make it."" A member of our party was a professional chef and he couldn't believe a restaurant with that reputation would be ok with serving a plate of nothing but plain, unseasoned, raw rice for $38. Lobster: chewy. Steak tartar: just an uncooked burger. Drinks: better suited for brunch, not dinner. The only thing we actually enjoyed was the meringue cake, but do they even make that in-house? I have dined at some of the finest restaurants in the world, and I can't believe New Yorkers consider this to be an excellent restaurant."

You are given the extra feel of attention throughout the whole experience.I ordered the Tagliolini and it was so rich and cheesy. The prosciutto was melt in your mouth delicious. My wifes mozzarella was as good as it gets and the braised rabbit and mash she ordered as her entree was cooked perfectly. Fall off the bone tender.

Some items were better than others, but everything was delicious. See images but this was such a great experience and if you don't know about Cipriani's then you have to try the Bellini. They are so yummy! I recommend sharing food with whoever you go with so that you can try a little bit of everything. I will be returning!"

Street parking sucks plus expensive if you use those garage parking, like $30 an hour. Prices are outrageously expensive even for a small appetizer and desserts. Foods we ordered:1) beef tartare- tasted like canned spam meat. Similar taste. Not bad but not great either.2) Appetizer salad of cucumber and avocados- it's good, pretty easy to replicate and make at home. 3) wagyu steak for $75!!!- Meh.... tasted like regular steak and it's fatty. They also cooked my steak wrong. I asked for medium rare, instead I got medium well. It comes with spinach and fried potatoes. Wished it had more flavor or spice into it. Peter Luger's steak is WAY better plus cheaper!4) lamb chops- was ok, not too gamey.5) osso bucco w/ risotto- was ok as well. Nothing memorable.6) pea risotto- same.... just ok.Our other companions ordered the salmon and something with curry. I don't think they were crazy about it either. My bf commented that the kids pasta (what his nephew got) was the only thing he liked and the mille feuille cake was good. The crepe dessert tasted like liquor which was inedible. My crepe was swimming in liquor. So there you have it. Maybe they excel on their pasta??? Will not return. Too expensive for a mediocre meal. Italian restaurant's I had in NJ are better.  Service wasn't good either. Very disappointed."

Yes, it's American-ized Chinese (that also happens to serve Thai Paid Thai) so don't expect what you'd be able to order from Chinatown or Chinese food from Flushing.I've had everything here from the Sweet & Sport Pork/Chicken, General Tso's Chicken, Orange Flavor Chicken, BBQ Spare Rib Tips, Regular Fried Chicken, Shrimp w Lobster Sauce, Beef & Broccoli and a plethora of other items from their menu. And in addition to being a tiny bit cheaper than the dozens of take out Chinese spots in Astoria, the quality and serving size is worth what you pay for. On top of that, they prepare the food fairly quick. They're practically open on every holiday and this also included when hurricane Sandy was hitting New York City pretty hard. It's a small place that's family owned/ran and they're nice.So if you want Americanized-Chinese take out, this is your joint. Don't listen to the naysayers probably asking for some fine cuisine."

The reason they're not getting 5 stars is because they took one hour and 15 min to get here...but in their defense it was a very rainy night and the guy showed up with more than 5 bags in his hands....so they were busy.  Highly recommend"

The wings were fine,  smaller than most but no issues, and the white rice was good,  moist. Servings were small, meaning a pint was not filled up,  not even the rice,, chicken was a small pile in a plastic container.Most importantly the food tasted bland, no crunch, soggy vegetables and general tso chicken was closer to steamed or microwave chicken pieces with sauce. So many better options for generic Chinese,  not even looking for authentic,  we won't return."

This Chinese place is that type of place, got me ? Good typical American Chinese, chicken wings, and marvelous sesame chicken; if you're looking for something super traditional, and have many dietary restrictions this place  is not for you.

Truth be told, I feel like the kitchen has become incrementally (barely noticeable unless you go as often as I do) cleaner than it was before. They've also kept the menu exactly the same as before which means that you can: 1.) Still order General Tso's Chicken wings and crab rangoon when you're jonesing for fried foods. 2.) They still offer both general tso's sauce and sweet and sour sauce.3.) Their fried rice remains the brown, chinese rice style fried rice as opposed to the yellow crap that New York chinese takeout places seem to favor. I'll admit that the garlic sauce/brown sauce/standard chinese takeout sauce has dropped a notch from indescribably delicious to just plain decent. Without the superb brown sauce, I don't crave the food quite as much as I used to."

Their sandwiches are amongst the best I've had anywhere, the bread is baked fresh on the premises and they only use Boar's head. Their sandwiches are huge and can honestly be split between 2 people, and the shop is also extremely clean.When you walk in, you walk straight up to the counter and place your order. They write it down right in front of you, repeat the order and ask you if your order is complete. If so, they pass on the order to the guys on the side to prepare the sandwich, you can actually watch ur sandwich get made. While all of this is getting done you can go pick your own pickle from one of their pickle barrels, they usually have sour and garlic to chose from...yum city! Those pickles are crack!

No, but it arguably offers the best value for the quality and price ($1 each). Their bagels are consistently solid, with the requisite chewiness inside. I love their everything bagels and even their everything, sesame, and multi-grain flats. For a sweeter alternative, their French toast bagels are fabulous. For novelty, they even offer rainbow bagels. Personally I don't think the multi-color swirls add much in the way of taste and don't love the use of food coloring, so wouldn't order them again. Definitely a neighborhood favorite of mine."

And they're really good, the green juice isn't too aggressively green if you know what I mean.

I've also tried their iced drinks, so good! Try the lycée juice with grass jelly, my favorite drink. There's something for everyone here, but don't come too late!

It wasn't just the taste of the cakes, but the fact that the creams tasted off as if the milk had gone bad. I was sooo disappointed and embarrassed bc they were taken as desserts for my sister's place. I am never going back to this place again and may never go to a bakery from this franchise ever again. I know they don't even care bc they only care about profit and mostly sell to their own people, but I hope this review makes ppl more aware and prevents someone from getting sick! We had to throw away everything! Next time I am heading to Paris Baguette and u should too! PS I wish I had saved them so I could take them back to these ppl to show them the crap they sell and they can really get ppl sick!"

The taro pastry too!I also really enjoy their Honey Lemon drink! It's very refreshing to drink. Their milk tea is also not bad, it's made with real tea and light cream."

I do not know how they make their bun so nice and fluffy, but its really nice and fluffy. It is a great place to grab breakfast on the way to work if you live in the area. It is around the corner from the Grand Ave subway station. My favorites are the pork bun, milk cream, and pineapple buns. and Of course their Egg tarts, which is kept in a heater, so when you buy it, its as if you got it out fresh from the oven. Their drinks are also amazing. Its not water down and they actually make it according to your taste. If you say, no sugar - its no sugar, but still tastes amazing. The only downside to this place is that they leave the buns out and customers have to pick out their own buns. Its efficient, but some customers are rude and dirty. They would take buns and put them back or not close the lid, etc. It makes me nervous, but I haven't had any issues or stomach problems. A+ though!"

I will no longer visit this establishment.I've been coming to Pepe Rosso to go for years (since they were at their much smaller location across the street. I walked in to place a take out order and was asked what I wanted. Me, ""Just a chicken parmigian with penne"". To which I got a snarky reply, ""Just? Just? I mean it's more than just chicken parmigian and penne..."". In my defense the word ""just"" was not a comment on the size of the dish but to be efficient and avoid the next question I usually get which is, ""would you like anything else with that?"". No that's all I am order because I JUST want the chicken pargmigian. Regardless the snark alone is nothing to get upset over...So I told them that I would be sitting outside waiting for my order.I go sit outside and I'm watching the pass and I see a take out order appear 10 minutes later. I watch the person who took my order walk over to it, look at it, and walk away. I'm assuming that it was not my order. Another 10 minutes go by and a second take out order appears. That one must be mine so I walk in and the server looks at me and looks at the pass and picks up the FIRST order (from 10 minutes earlier) and hands it to me. The cherry on he cake is when I got home and opened my cold chicken parm to find it burned with black char on both ends.Fair well Pepe Rosso."

We did have to stand and wait for our food until the table was open, but the staff was very nice and once our food came, it was very good. In terms of salads, the orange salad was actually quite flavorful. It was more curated and interesting than most salads served at Italian restaurants. I would recommend this restaurant if you were looking for a quick but high-quality Italian run by people who know the cuisine inside and out."

I ordered the Tagliolini and Porcini Mushroom in a Tomato Cream Sauce which is one of their more popular dishes. I wasn't a fan of the spaghetti like pasta itself, but did like the mushrooms. Very well seasoned. The sauce was okay, a little underwhelming. Don't think I'll go back because of the prices especially when there is so much good Italian food in the area."

It was recommended on a Tiktok I saw but personally I didn't love this type of pasta and it was a bit dry. The special pink sauce is pretty much the same in both dishes. And both good. I regret not getting something with a different sauce so I could try a different flavor. It also Came with some free bread to dip in olive oil and vinegar which I liked.Overall Ambience was fun and cute, the penne vodka is what made it worth it for me."

The owner greets every customer most days even on a busy afternoon. Those little things matter. Lastly what do I say about their baked goods. I'll leave it as wow! I recommend try everything!

The best thing about this place is that it's tucked in a corner so no large crowds inside or distractions outside. Then again, I went on a Tuesday afternoon so it may be more crowded earlier in the day or on weekends. The pastries all looked amazing and it has just the right hint of coffee smell. I chose the ""financier"" and it was just about small enough to make you not regret the calories. It wasn't overpowering or anything. The music isn't set too loud so you can still have a conversation, but loud enough to drown out the sound of passing cars. Also, they played Amy Whinehouse so what more is there to say?"

The place looks nice enough and I heard the pastry options were different that most generic places. I haven't given a review yet, since I hoped things would improve. Now, I feel the need to post. It is almost impossible to just order a coffee with a quick 'hello,' and 'see ya.' I don't mind polite conversation etc., that's not what I am saying, it is just that the employees are way too pushy on up-selling. Even after I have been polite and said I'd try one at another time, every time I go they are still pushy. Won't be returning or recommending this place. Too bad."

I almost went back to the register and asked for my money back because the girl who gave my food was rude. I asked for ketchup and she flung it into the bag with sass. This happened between 11:58am and 12:05 on top of that she wanted to give me a burnt hash brown bite. I told her that if she didn't want to work there then don't. She was the only one by the ovens preparing the food while the other girl with the glasses prepared the drink. That girl needs better customer service skills. I was disgusted looking at her.

I am glad that I used the restroom prior to ordering, because what I saw in the restroom disgusted me and caused me to leave without making a purchase. There was a pile of human feces in the sink of the bathroom. It was the most unsanitary and disgusting thing I have ever seen, and it will be difficult for me to ever visit another dunkin donuts location in the future. The staff seemed indifferent, and on top of thepile of feces in the sink, there was dried urine everywhere, on the toilet, on the floor, I did not even want to touch the door to get back out of the bathroom. Completely disgusting. I have a photos to prove this, but it does not seem there is a way to upload it. Dunkin donuts should be ashamed."

2342,lQ7H-COT5duZQQ0XqGFPDg,3/5/2022,4 star rating,"I've been wanting to try this place for a while, mainly drawn because of their aesthetic appeal. Finally came for a weekend brunch with friends and it did not disappoint! The waiter quoted a 10-15 minute wait for a table indoors or be seated right away for outdoors. We asked if it was heated outside and they said said, yes. We sat outside for a little, but be warned, it is freezing! We ended up opting to switch to a table inside. Remember to tell a waiter if you change your table since your order is linked to the table that you scanned for the menu.The menu is easy to order from and gives options for customizations, but be cautious of the additional prices (changing from a sunnyside egg to scrambled is an additional 2$!). The food and drinks all looked so pretty, we couldn't wait to order and get our foods but it was difficult to decide what to get! I ended up ordering the lavender latte and maple bacon egg waffle. The latte was just the right hint of lavender and sweetness. And the waffle, well you can never go wrong with crispy savory bacon and waffle done right. Overall, this is a great place to come by for brunch with the girls if you're in the area or just want a good sit down place with good coffee and standard comfort brunch foods. Although we all enjoyed our meal, we agreed that we weren't entirely full. The indoor seating area is also pretty cozy and dimly lit, and admittedly a bit tight. But we never were rushed to leave and the waiters are all so nice here that it is worth a return visit."

There is also an outdoor patio  at the back that allows for outdoor seating, so if you're there for more than just coffee be sure to try snag a table there! Their hearty waffles and Benedicts were delicious - the ricotta berry waffle was not overly sweet given the toppings it came with, and is perfect for sharing. We ordered the salmon eggs Benedict too, and it came beautifully plated with a beet sauce on top adding an extra pop of colour. Not to mention the lightly tossed spring Salad on the side, which was actually great to counter the heavier waffle we had. A lot of students come here to study too, as they freely give out their wifi and so it's definitely a more chill vibe here with a lot of the younger crowd."

Both of us at the table thought the pancakes tasted microwaved, but was made better by the fruits and mascarpone....until I noticed mold growing on like 3 of my strawberries (yikes!) My smoked 'n scrambled toast had way too much dill cream and the toast was a bit stale and soggy in a way that made it difficult to cut and chew.On top of that, the vibe was weird - the food was brought to our table on the patio by a server, but when I asked for glasses of water he said we had to get it ourselves inside at the bar. The water was in tiny plastic cups which just seemed odd for a sit down place. There was also no music playing outside which made it eerily quiet."

Sadly, many spots have closed as a result of Covid, others open at Noon or don't have indoor seating (which sucks on a hot day.)Outro has a great menu and, although it looks small on the outside, it's very spacious AND has outdoor seating in the back. The staff is friendly and they have no touch menus via qr code. I will definitely return!!"

Want even more seclusion- go to their outdoor patio. Good unassuming service, late hours on a Sunday afternoon and the best part?Taro cold brew. Awesome dark brew jolts you awake as you receive a small sized cold plastic to-go cup. Unclip the cover and a splendid purple (ube color) inch thick foam with a mint leaf atop. You were supposed to mix that splendid foam and now it tastes like a chocolate coffee. Noms. Shhhhh let's keep Outro on the dlo."

The farmhouse egg sandwich was delicious. They had this bacon jam which was different but yummy. The egg is runny and it has avocado and cherry tomatoes with it. Ordered an expresso and matcha latte. Perfect for a Christmas Day brunch.
2349,lQ7H-COT5duZQQ0XqGFPDg,10/17/2022,1 star rating,"This place seems like a tourist trap.   Really overpriced and underwhelming for the cost. Avoid unless you are desperate for a cafe. We got the French Toast and Salmon Avo Waffle. Both were decent but for the price and quantity it left us both still hungry. Not worth a $50+ breakfast. I've had far better French toast for a fraction of the price. Caramel macchiato is poorly done, I couldn't bring myself to finish it.  The coffee itself was quite weak too, could barely taste it (they over sweetened the drink). Golden Latte was well made but this is a cafe and should be known for good coffee. The one positive thing about this place is the abundance of seating. It's quite large in the back so I suppose if you have a big group, etc it might be worth coming here. I don't think I'll come back here again and I leave this as a honest review and heads-up if folks want to know what to expect."

2359,lQ7H-COT5duZQQ0XqGFPDg,12/25/2017,5 star rating,"I usually order out here for lunch through Seamless so I've never really had the dining-in experience. Every single time that I've ordered here from Seamless, I've received great service and my order is always fresh and ready to go by the time I arrive. Even though Seamless estimates 20 minutes, my order is ready in 10 (I'm impatient haha so I do try to go ahead of time to see if my food is ready). The door might be easy to miss the first time visiting the place but their store front sign is very noticeable. The interior is quite dimly lit from my less-than-a-minute-encounter with them since the employees greet you as soon as you step in and take-out orders are placed on the table right by the door. My usual order is the Tri-Roll Combo Lunch and I think it's probably the best deal in the area - 3 rolls of your choice + a salad or soup for $12.75. I usually get the Eel Avocado Roll, Salmon Avocado Roll, and Alaska Roll. The ginger and wasabi are clearly separated by the leafy grass thing which I'm always glad about and the rolls are arranged in alternating rolls in the box which I love. Overall this is a solid place to grab sushi for a good deal if you're in the area and I'd definitely give it 5 stars."

So thumbs up for that! He spoke broken English FYI, but still got it right!! (Not hard to have someone pre-read and translate prior, bring ID to enter building so food can be brought to 7th floor when it's done right!!)

We've crawfish in special seasoning, which is the better of the two, and clams in garlic pepper - it's so huge, too chewy.

This visit We got shrimp with head in boil sauce and clams in garlic butter.  Both sauces were delicious as always and my dining mates got rice to eat the leftover sauce.  The clams were very meaty and tasted fresh.  The shrimps were also fresh and not mushy.  I have to say I tried many places since The Boil and this is still the way ahnds down.  So if you like seafood boils, come here the OG and taste the best!"

Just because I love to save & they have a bigger selection of seafood. On the contrary...The boil sauce is hands down the best sauce I ever had for seafood boils. It would be so amazing if you guys added oysters or clams and killed it with the sauce. Or even a happy hour special. I'm a huge fan of you're  drinks. I've been to the Chrystie Street location a million of times lol I've been w/ friends and even had my co workers from Tiffany's have a huge outting there. This location is bigger I believe and I could feel the great service. They have indoor and outdoor seating and like I said the boil sauce is so good it makes you want to take it home save it & cook with it. At least that's would I do I'm a huge fan !
2377,Fu7J2Fwoj_S6Jpg9dULzKg,7/15/2021,4 star rating,This place is definitely a fun place to eat for seafood lovers. Suggest making a reservation because it gets fairly busy.They only take cash but there is an ATM there. The wait staff is friendly and informative. The only thing I thought was silly is the sides. We ordered garlic bread to come with our meal and it was basic slider buns toasted with butter and a little garlic on them. There is no way it was worth what we paid for it. This should've been something served for free at that point. The gumbo was delicious and all the seafood was fresh and tasty.
2378,Fu7J2Fwoj_S6Jpg9dULzKg,8/15/2021,4 star rating,"The Boil is a Cajun boil seafood restaurant. If you don't know what a boil is: basically, they give you a large pile of seafood that you peel/crack open yourself. It gets messy. They give you gloves and a bib. The food and service were pretty good. They have indoor seating. I reserved on OpenTable. The downside is their list of unfriendly rules. My OpenTable reservation stated that the reservation would only be held for 15 minutes, that there's a $15 charge per person for no-shows or cancellations, and that I'd only have a table for 1.5 hours. They didn't enforce the 1.5 hour rule. They have some more rules that they didn't mention in the OpenTable email. They're cash-only. They charge a mandatory 20% service fee."
2379,Fu7J2Fwoj_S6Jpg9dULzKg,2/1/2022,5 star rating,My first time coming to this place and it was soooooo good. It is a bit pricey but soo good and enjoyable. My boyfriend took me here for date night and we over ordered but that was fine they give it to you to go in a bag and we had it for dinner the next day. We ordered 1 crab for each and 1 lb of jumbo shrimp in their signature sauce. It comes with potatoes and corn. It was so messy and delicious. I had a great time and the waitress was also amazing.  I have no complaints. I also ordered a passion fruit lemonade that they have and it is absolutely amazing.  A bit on the sweeter side.  So If you're not a fan of sweet drinks you may not like it. I ordered some calamari too and it was perfect. I am a huge calamari fan and it was delicious. They are an all cash facility and 20% gratuity is applied to the bill reguardless of number of people. I had a great time and would absolutely go back !!
2380,Fu7J2Fwoj_S6Jpg9dULzKg,2/22/2022,5 star rating,Very good experience. Got the Queen combo 1CL Snow Crab + 1lb Crawfish served with a corn and potatoes and a side of garlic butter sausage. Ordered a side of fries as well. Let me start by saying these Cajun fries were bomb.com. I love fries in general these reminded me of the utz bbq chips with a kick. But we're crispy and fresh. Served with I think horseradish sauce?The boil itself was very plenty full. I would definitely sub the crawfish for shrimp next time. It comes with one corn and a good amount of potatoes served on the side and you dump it in the bag yourself. There's also an extensive drink menu. I would certainly come again

We got Dungeness crab, snow crab & a whole lobster to share for two people. Loved the included sides of corn & potatoes as it helps to fill in those final nooks & crannies of pure protein. Dipping the potatoes in the boil sauce is incredible. 4 stars just because they're cash only, they do have an ATM at the front."

The bagels are fine. They don't have gluten free. They have random mini bagel flavors. They run out. And flat bagels. I get a turkey bacon egg and cheese on a bagel and it's about $6. Kinda skimpy on the bacon. Maybe 1-2 slices. The bagels are soft and chewy. Not huge. Not overly doughy. Sadly they serve coffee in styrofoam cups."

Today I order something different I order a bacon egg and cheese on a roll. And I was still impressed they the order came in really fast and the food was delicious. I also recommend getting their fresh squeezed orange juice.

Wonderfully creative food with excellent service and a beautiful view of the East River. For restaurant week we were quite surprised to have the regular menu at restaurant week pricing. Truly the best We have found anywhere for restaurant week. Rather than get a special restaurant week very limited menu as we've had in many restaurants this was the full menu at a restaurant week price. What a pleasure!The acorn squash appetizer with coddled egg was recommended and it was amazing! I also had the brisket that was delicious. My wife had the pork chop which was perfectly prepared.  The desserts as well or beautifully presented and delicious.I must also comment that the staff were excellent. Our waitress Angela was delightful and very professional.This is what restaurant week is supposed to be an opportunity to truly try a restaurant and it's best for me.

At the end of dinner, they took out the page, rolled it up like a diploma, and gave it back tied in a ribbon as a keepsake. That alone had me sold.The staff was top-notch and the food was melt in your mouth good. Their menu options are vast, so it was nice to have some different options. The milk & cereal dessert is worth the hype, you get to crack the a chocolate dome with your utensil and watch the milk slide on to the rest of the plate - it's really dope.It also doesnt hurt that the restaurant has a gorgeous backdrop of the city - perfect for date night or a special occasion.I am already planning on coming  back again."

The mozzarella was soft and oozy, the way it should  be.

Dip it in the ruby streaks, you won't regret it.SMOKED BRISKETI wish I had a bigger stomach to enjoy this- truly. The brisket fell apart with my fork like a meat waterfall doused in pommes purée and chasseur sauce...was extremely hearty and filling. I'm a huge fan of mushrooms and the sauce with a hint of tarragon and puntarelle kind of reminded me of a soy sauce family flavor.

They served kafta kebob made of Chicken, filet mignon, beef and some hand cut frites. The chicken was amazing. I definitely recommend kafta kebobs."

We took the rest of the lamb home! There is a generous amount of fries given to you for each shawarma, along with pita bread. While we liked the chicken, our favorite was the lamb. We waited an extra 2 hours for the lamb due to an error in the kitchen. But I'd say it was worth the wait. The appetizer that we chose was the mezze & dips tower. It was more than enough for our group. The drinks we ordered were very strong. I personally could not enjoy mine because if I drank the whole thing, I would have left too intoxicated to breastfeed my baby. Lol. Atmosphere wise: Yelpers were correct in that it does get very loud. Not even guest-wise. Music wise. It's what the restaurant prefers but it didn't help with the crying child at another table. I wish that they turned down the music for everyone's sake when that occurred. It wasn't the child that I was mad at either. I just wish they would have not turned up the music louder when the child was getting more upset. Eventually the child calmed down but the music stayed at the loudest volume ever. We did ask if they could turn down the music. Even though our waitress told us she would ask, I know that she can only do so much when that was what the restaurant wants.Long story short: Food is great. Atmosphere is definitely for large adult groups."
2404,IiLLntICUim7YREkIBU7lA,11/23/2022,4 star rating,"This place has been on my list for quite some time, so when we had some friends visiting from out of town and we were celebrating a special occasion, we figured it was worth finally trying for one of those novel tableside-shawarma experiences. Oh and it did not disappoint!We all ordered drinks, my partner and I each got beers (pretty interesting selection) while our visiting friends for cocktails (which they said we're really strong). They also have an extensive wine list (but not sure if they carry all in stock year round, as the wines my partner wanted were both out). Food-wise, we were told that the off menu tableside shawarma was $98 for chicken and ~$140 for beef or lamb, and that is could feed 2-3 people. My take is that it could actually feed 4-5 people (we almost used it as a food challenge between the four of us). So don't feel pressured if you are with a smaller group to order more mains or tons of apps. We also ordered the baba and halloumi to start, which were delicious (but again not necessarily for us at least). The chicken shawarma was so tender and delicious and came with many delectible sauces and sides - oh and the fries were tasty as well. A lot of food for sure! We ended with two desserts that were delicious- but couldn't finish (not that we were hungry, but we were celebrating and they looked amazing) The place was packed for a Monday night, but service was still attentive, friendly, and helpful. Would definitely go back!"
2405,IiLLntICUim7YREkIBU7lA,3/28/2023,4 star rating,"Dined here for lunch on a weekday with a group of 7 and it was a great time! We sat outside since it was so beautiful and sunny and luckily there was great outdoor enclosed seating available. The service was exceptional and the staff was very friendly. For drinks I had the passion fruit margarita which was nice and tart. For appetizers we got the spicy falafel which was nice and crunchy outside and soft inside and went well with the dips, we also had the mezze and dips tray which was beautiful and had a wide variety of good options. The potatoes, baba ganoush, and cauliflower were my favorites. For entrees we got two supreme platters that came with Chicken, filet mignon, chicken kafta, beef kafta kebab, baby lamb chops & jumbo shrimps, served with hand-cut frites. 2 of these with the appetizers was more than enough for our group of 7 (menu says supreme is good for 2 but it depends how much you eat and if you get appetizers also). A little disappointed though because the supreme is supposed to come with lamb chops but unfortunately the restaurant didn't have any more so we ended up getting a replacement meat instead -really wanted the lamb chops though. All the meat was delicious and the shrimp and filet mignon was really good and flavorful. The fries are also a must! The staff also brought a few small sides that accompanied the food like pickles and garlic sauces and it went great with the meal. Overall I would come back."

The chicken hummus and arayes were pretty good portions even though they were called ""small"" plates. The flatbread pizza and fries were tasty too. Lots of great sauces. Fun spot for large gatherings and bdays as the outdoor seating areas have a lot of tables. Super unique foods and fun experience but I probably prefer other Mediterranean restaurants in nyc."

The delivery was fast and the food came carefully packed and very organized in two very heavy duty bags with ""Handle Cuffs"" which is a nice touch so you know your food hasn't been touched during delivery. We are vegetarian so were very happy with the selections offered. My personal favorite was the  Arnabeet Bi Tarator at $16.50 which is fried cauliflower with yogurt tahini sauce, I loved it the cauliflower was cooked to perfection and basically just dissolved in my mouth, the sauce was very tangy, which I loved, but it was too strong for my partner. I got the Fattet Al-Betanjane for $16.00, twice now. It is eggplant on toasted pita bread, smothered with garlic yogurt sauce, very garlicy sauce but unfortunately the second time the eggplant was way too saturated in oil to ever order again.  Moving right along the Jebne Manouche $9.50 is a blend of five cheeses on baked flatbread, basically Lebanese Pizza, it was very good not too big. Then we also tried the Mudardara, traditional rice and lentils topped with caramelized onions, plenty of onions which is important and they used French Lentils, which don't get as soft as regular lentils, it was $12.50 and a good size. It had a great taste. But French Lentils are not my favorite and these needed to be cooked way longer. I really like the Falafel Pita Sandwich, and will get it again soon.  Unfortunately the Sumac Fries were great the first time but really soaked thru with oil the next time, I'll never order these again. All in all, there are a few items I will try again, but because of the extreme oiliness my partner won't be sharing in this dinner again."

Reasonably priced for the amount of food!CHICKEN SHAWARMA: appeared to be your traditional shawarma, but didn't taste like traditional shawarma.  But still delicious and tender. Served with a lot of fries and bread. $98 for chicken, and $138 for beef or lamb (feeds up to 6 or 7 people - we were 5 and ate all of it). Eat with the garlic paste - it was delicious.LAHMA BI AJIN: delicious bread with minced meat. Highly recommend as a starter!ZA'ATAR MANOUCHE: delicious bread with a lot of za-atar (a spice, that isn't spicy). Highly recommend as a starter!HUMMUS: wouldn't get it again. Not your traditional hummus. Has extra tahini sauce in it? BABA GHANOUSH: also wouldn't get it again. Too creamy and didn't taste like Baba ghanoush.SEMAK MESHWI: perfectly cooked fish. Huge portion. Will have to take out bones, but if you like fish - would recommend.Sat outside in the heated area - Music isn't as loud and we felt we could better hear each other, while still enjoying the Arabic music."

Most recently, we did a walk in on a Sunday afternoon and there were a few seats available. We actually chose to sit outside because we brought our dog with us. They were nice enough to even bring her a water bowl!  I love coming here and trying all of their different appetizers. This time we got the shishito peppers, wasabi cucumber tataki, and nami nori salad that were all so good. For drinks, if you're into IPAs they have a pretty good one that both my husband and I really enjoyed called Echigo Flying IPA imported from Japan. We opt in for the create your own set. I got the tuna poke, x.o scallop, coconut shrimp, toro + scallion, and a classic salmon + avocado. They were all sooo good. The coconut shrimp surprisingly was my favorite! I normally love toro anything but the toro + scallion was mediocre for $12. I would've preferred eating two coconut shrimp instead Overall, food is delicious but a little on the pricier side. If you're looking to splurge a little on a nice date with great vibes and like to try new things, this is the spot. I love this place and will continue to come back!"

They do all temaki omakase style so you don't feel rushed to eat.  We ordered the strawberry sting- delicious, furikake fries (they were okay), and salmon avocado, tuna poke, spicy tuna cucumber, and the special of the day salmon skin with ikura.  My favorite was the tuna poke.  Everything comes seasoned with soy sauce and wasabi.The music was played at a good volume and I enjoyed the songs played.Would I come back?

To get us full, the bill was about $300. Something I can pay for decent omakase somewhere. Each piece  was good but not memorable. Heavy handed with wasabi. Rice wasn't exactly seasoned well and was a bit mushy. Chili items were as expected but seemed like everything was spicy. The mmmmm you get from eating a good piece of sushi was noticeably missing with these handrolls. Maybe an unfair comparison but I'm level setting. Two of us had an assortment of 13 rolls. Pretty much everything but the veg options. Best one was sadly the coco shrimp. Uni was good but with the price of MP, I probably paid close to $30 for it. Most disappointing was the toro added caviar. A bit bland and the caviar was mushy. A lot to say cause I'm bleh and disappointed."

I think a lot of people dismiss Nami Nori as being overrated because of its social media boom, but I think it is well worth the hype! All of the different combinations of hand rolls are fun and tasty and the ambiance is a fun, hip place to take your friends. Reservations are a must!My friend and I both did the create your own hand roll options- this is definitely more expensive than getting the set options but how can you resist choosing your own adventure? We had the most lovely Yuzu sake to pair with our meal - it was so delicious we ordered two bottles! Albeit the bottles are quite small but it was that scrumptious~ not too sweet as a lot of yuzu sakes tend to be and perfectly refreshing."

Chili flavor is good and somewhat mala/numbingShrimp - warm deep fried coconut shrimp, sweet and sour notes, very shrimp depth due to mini shrimpsSea Bass - Nice texture and balanced flavor profile, hot sauce bright out the natural flavors of the ingredientsCucumber - surprisingly flavorful, cucumber didn't overpower the roll and wasn't super fibrous, black sesame was umamiOverall, just what was needed on a hot summer day.

We had gone to Nami Nori a few months ago on a cold night. Since we didn't have reservations, we were only able to get seats in the outdoor seating. The server accommodated us with hand warmers to keep us warm as he took the order. But moved us in as soon as there was a table available. I'll never forget this excellent hospitality.I'd recommend the signature set so you can try a lot of different flavors. I got to taste flavors that I had never tasted before. I won't take too much time explaining because 1) it is difficult to explain in words and 2) you should try it yourself. Make sure to get a reservation especially if you have a bigger group.11/10 recommend!"

The uni, the toro and scallion. The xo scallop, the spicy crab dynamite and the yellowtail. The fish here is so fresh and the pairing are really good!

Such a solid temaki spot that isn't overly priced for the quality. My favorite one was surprisingly the Coconut Shrimp. It came out pipping hot and super crispy and even though it's not a traditional ""sushi"" piece, I loved the modern twist they put on it and that they included it in the menu. The XO Scallop and Aka Ebi were standouts as well."

It's definitely on the pricier end with our groups lunch being around ~$60 pp. If you get the signature selection it's a lot cheaper than building your own but the selection is a little underwhelming, even for the cheaper price.I personally got the build your own temaki with caviar add (+$12) and the caviar was not worth it. Though what I got was good, I wasn't too blown away by any specific temaki I got. Overall, the presentation was nice and all but It wasn't amazing for what we paid for.Lastly, keep in mind temaki takes time to set up and make. Our group ordered around lunch time and waited almost 40 minutes for our orders to come out."

The name claimed to promise a fusion between American and Moroccan cuisines. The place was lightly packed at 1pm. The chef and probably owner of the place greeted me kindly at the cashier. I took a brief moment to explore the menu, listing a number of breakfast items and sandwiches, before deciding on the Moroccan Meatball Sandwich.The sandwich was substantial. The kefta (meatballs) perfectly cooked and juicy. Slightly spicy, as the owner has warned me, the flavor of the sauce complimented the lightly seasoned meatballs and fresh vegetables inside. The italian bread encasing the meat and vegetable was fresh and crispy. I can see this place being a reliable lunch/snack spot for the locals in the area."

My husband and I both ordered eggs- he got an omelet, I got the frittata- and they were extraordinary. The flavors were just perfection and the eggs cooked perfectly.

I must admit I wasn't prepared for how good it would be.We started with a Msemnen, iced Moroccan tea and coffee - it all was amazing; a perfect breakfast if we would have needed one and very affordable. Things only got better from there - when Couscous arrived I initially thought that a plate for a single person was to share for the entire table. The portion was really huge and extremely good - the vegetables and meat were cooked to a perfection, melting in your mouth. The Semolina was cooked to perfection as well - very soft but not overcooked.We finished our meals with two cups of espresso - good choice of beans and ground still from the owner.In the end this place is an amazing location for ethnic food and is currently getting so much less attention compared to what it's cooking deserves.Would absolutely recommend!"

Friendly staff and lots of choices on the menu for you to choose from. Great atmosphere for dine in or just get it to go. Only con is delivery doesn't come to your door if you live in an apartment.
2444,L3-1UKU5mUQjowd0Y74Ixw,1/15/2017,5 star rating,I come all the way from Texas to enjoy this Chinese restaurant.  Super clean place with delicious Chinese food. Low ratings are totally unwarranted and must belong to another place with the same name.

The customer service is great, I read in other reviews that they were hit or miss or overall grumpy. Not the case for me, thankfully. Delivery time is usually 30 mins, 40 during bad weather or holidays. The delivery guys are also really friendly, even after walking up 4 flights of stairs. My fave dishes are: Hunan Beef (spicy), chicken and broccoli, chicken lo mein, and sesame chicken. They also have brown rice if your trying to be more healthy. I love this place, it's my go to Chinese food restaurant. I haven't been disappointed yet."

2448,L3-1UKU5mUQjowd0Y74Ixw,5/4/2009,4 star rating,"One thing East Flatbush has no shortage of is Chinese takeout. There's practically one on every block and on some blocks two. The problem is they all pretty much suck. The bulletproof glass, the dirty floors, the sub par food you end up eating half of and tossing away, it's  almost always a meal you regret. Unless you go to Dynasty Chinese. This is excellent chinese food, that will leave you with no regrets. They proudly post signs that your food is cooked fresh and they don't ""recycle"" food. Obviously anyone can make these claims, but based on numerous dining experiences here, they're telling the truth. I've been on a mushroom kick recently and the pork with mushrooms and chicken with mushrooms have been consistently excellent. I'm also a fan of their dumplings and veggie spring rolls.In addition to having excellent food, this is one of the only takeout places where I don't mind eating in. The seating area is clean and well light, there is a TV to watch, and a bathroom for customers to use; and it's clean!  While this may seem basic, it's unusual for a chinese takeout place in this area.There are probably 1/2 dozen chinese places closer to my house, but I'll walk a few extra blocks to eat well at Dynasty."

The vegetarian selections are delightful.It is a shame they are not centered properly at the junction and put some of those other raggedy Chinese places out of biz.They should be the model for chinese take out places in Brooklyn.

I ordered from them at around 11:30 pm one night; they close at 12 mid night...and they took my order but never showed up. Never called back, never told me it would be a problem...nothing. I assumed that everything was all good until I checked the time and when I called back they had already closed.I forgot to mention that I was located approximately 4 blocks away. Yeah......No missed calls, my phone was turned up all the way; they obviously delivered to me before. They need to stop that shit."
2452,OqNmzS2N2I750zYgUC6IgA,4/10/2018,3 star rating,Came in around 11:40pm on a Saturday night and tried their cocktails. My friend got the queen bee and I got the mighty gabby. They turned out to be a lot more expensive than I thought being a 2$$ bar in Astoria. The taste and portion was mediocre too. And people were in our space a lot since we had to sit at the bar no other seats available.
2453,OqNmzS2N2I750zYgUC6IgA,4/25/2015,3 star rating,"My friends and I stopped in at this North Astoria bar on a Thursday (as part of our aptly-named series, ""Astoria Thursdays"") around 7 PM. The space was on the smaller side and didn't have much to offer in the way of decor. The lights were on for most of our visit, but around 8, the room gets a little dimmer and the bartender comes around with candles.As one would expect at a watering hole, there were drinks aplenty: Fancy cocktails, wine, beer, and your average mixed drinks. Unfortunately, there's no food. In addition, you can't bring it in from the outside. So they let love in, but no food?? Food IS love, man.Anyway, so just the drinks. I started off with the Smoking in Bed [tequila, mezcal, St. Germain, lime juice, bitters]. I always love mezcal, and I liked the inclusion of the St. Germain, but to be honest, this drink didn't blow me away. Just a solid choice for fans of the agave. The happy hour specials ran until 8, and we had a decent amount of options to choose from: wines, wells, $2 off Pacifico (my second drink), and $1 Narragansetts. Unfortunately, when we tried to chat with the bartender about the drinks, he made it pretty clear that he had no intention of conversing with us any more than was absolutely necessary. My friend, a Rhode Island native, innocently asked if they were going to have the Narragansett shandy on tap this summer and he immediately shut her down, saying that he didn't get to choose what the bar serves and he doesn't make those decisions, etc. He could've just said he didn't know... we were essentially just trying to be friendly, but our friendliness obviously didn't go over so well. :-/We left after spending about an hour here, mainly because we had to eat something ASAP in the face of an impending hangover the next morning. If the LetLove Inn fixed the food issue, the attitudes, and maybe spruced up the cocktails a smidge, i'd probably be inclined to give it a four. For now, it's squarely in 3-star territory."

As if the odor of unclean toilet could be overwhelmed... Do they forget that that have been born inside the food Mecca of nyc?! Happy hour is a joke - 4-6? Seriously? Your beers on tap are a season behind?So... What exactly are you offering beside unadorned walls (that looks like some kind of lame hipster minimalist aesthetic, or like you're too cheap to invest in good art), and a pathetic line up of ""draft"" beers not available on happy hour? Meh."
2460,OqNmzS2N2I750zYgUC6IgA,3/23/2015,5 star rating,"This is a nice bar to duck into a little after 4pm and have a few Missionaries (one of their delicious cocktails), before bumbling over to CVS and picking up the toilet paper your roommate always gets out of buying for some reason. I've went ahead and created a handy guide for anyone else out there who likes to get their errands done after a few stiff ones: After drinking 1 Missionary: You'll go to CVS, but you'll be just sober-buzzed enough to be miserable by the florescent lights and annoyed by the lack of selection of toilet paper. You're too lazy to go to Key Food--it's not on the way home. After drinking 2 Missionaries: You'll make it to CVS, and find the toilet paper. You'll buy goldfish crackers on a whim on your way to the self-checkout. You'll feel really, really, super about the whole ordeal.After drinking 3 Missionaries: You'll make it to CVS, stop in the entryway, turn around and order a burrito from the taco truck. Then you'll go back into CVS, buy the toilet paper, decide it might be a good idea to buy a few Snapples as well, pay by debit card, and withdraw enough cash to pay for your burrito. After 3 Missionaries + a beer: You're still determined to go to CVS, but it can wait until after this beer. After 3 Missionaries, + a beer, + any other cocktail: There is no CVS in your future. On a closing note, I would just like to add that as someone who appreciates a well-made cocktail, I like the fact that I can actually savor and smell each ingredient in my drink, without it being overpowered by stinky cheese or someone's food truck burrito. If it's a burrito that I'm not eating, I don't like it. Cheers."
2461,OqNmzS2N2I750zYgUC6IgA,1/30/2015,5 star rating,"A bar named after a Nick Cave song already sets a high level of expectation, in my book...  Fortunately, the LetLove Inn completely lives up to that! Beautiful interior design, excellent cocktails, music, and charismatic bar tenders.  The perfect little neighborhood spot for meeting a friend or going on a romantic date (and, dare I say, the kind of bar I could completely envision Nick Cave himself hanging out in?). I can't wait to spend many more evenings here!p.s. apparently another yelper thought the lack of signage outside made this bar seem ""sketchy""... I don't know what to say to that, except some of the best bars I've been to were the hardest ones to find or the ones with the least signage.  So if you prefer loud advertisements, there are a few crappy sports bars within a 3-block radius for you.  But if you're after something better than that, you'll certainly appreciate the LetLove Inn."

2464,0FaLilJs2VN83hOEBcBnPg,12/1/2019,5 star rating,I love this place for drinks! It is easy to reserve a table and the waiters are so nice. It is a small intimate place but if you come on a weeknight there is no trouble reserving a table. They are so accommodating. I have been here for several girls night outs on a weeknight and we were always able to get a large table for many people. They are able to combine tables to accommodate as well. They have a great selection for drinks and I loved their rose Prosecco. Their pours are huge too! They definitely do not skimp on their pours. I felt like each wine pour was a glass and a half so after two wines I was definitely feeling it! They also have an outdoor space that looks really cute for when the weather is warm. The b69 runs right in front of them and so it's easy to get to!

2466,0FaLilJs2VN83hOEBcBnPg,7/16/2019,4 star rating,"Brookvin excels at its primary goals--they have a great and varied wine selection and excellent cheese plates. If you like wine and cheese (and if not, I mean...why???) it's a great location for both--with a lovely outdoor seating area in the backyard where you can indulge in a delightful setting at your leisure, to boot. A couple of their other small plate options are impressive as well--they have a stunningly excellent mac 'n cheese, a very tasty chicken pot pie, and a varying seasonal menu of crostini plates that are generally good.  These small plates are, well... particularly small though.  Don't plan to share, or stock up accordingly!I'd stick mostly to that cheese--and especially wine--though.  Cocktails I've tried have been mediocre at best--honey-thyme whiskey sour was overly tart and disappointing, and even a standard old fashioned wasn't quite up to snuff.  Draft beer options are quite limited and uninspired.  They have a great happy hour deal until 7pm Tu-Fri and until 5pm Sat-Sun on house wines, draft beer as well as mac and cheese and a selected crostini.  Perfect for the wine and small plates they excel at."

Checked our vaccinations and were greeted by name. Several staffers were by our table to drop food/drinks/water and all of them were just ridiculously friendly and seemed happy to be there.Snacks were good. We got the mozzarella salad and some paté. The backyard can be a little buggy and we hadn't sprayed up but they were super nice about us moving inside. I don't know, we just really loved our experience here and wished we lived closer because we'd definitely be here ALL the time if we did! It's just a perfect neighborhood bar, period."

It's a small, unsuspecting place from the outside. Step inside to a dim, calm, welcoming atmosphere. You'll feel instantly sexy.The outdoor patio is where we chose to sit even though it was lightly drizzling. The staff made sure our table and chairs were dry before we sat. We came on a Tuesday night around 6:00, so we made it to happy hour before 7:00. There are 3 wines that are on happy hour. The rose was super delicious. Brookvin is a tapas bar. We ordered 3 dishes- prosciutto, meatballs, and the rice cakes. The best dish were the rice cakes! They were moist on the inside and were salty/crispy on the outside as they should be. The prosciutto plate was standard and the meatballs were fresh with a light red sauce. I left with a happy belly. The service was amazing. I can't wait to come back over the summer to sit out on the patio. Brookvin is the perfect little place for a romantic date. Mwah, bonsoir!"
2472,diiUjS6uHvbQRoiWOGKXsA,5/17/2019,5 star rating,"There's one primary reason that this place deserves five stars. And I'm pretty damn picky. It's because the food is consistently good--like having your mom cook food for you the way you like all the time. The owner comes from a family of cooks and has been cooking her entire life, and she's just an amazingly sweet and lovely woman. If that's not enough for you to have a host that cooks consistently well and greet you with a smile consistently then I don't know what the heck you're looking for when you go out to eat. From my perspective there are only two reasons to go out to eat: 1) to get food that you normally can't get at home.2) to be waited on and served in such a way that you want to return to a place.The Barbecue Pit is far, far more than just barbecue. From their samosas, to their fried chicken, to their lentil soup, and Mediterranean and Indian fare, there's nothing this amazing woman can't cook. If you're looking for a place you can trust that you're going to be well received and well fed for a very fair price, don't just do take out, come here and sit in. It's cozy, it's friendly, and it's delicious. How do I know all this? Because I think I've eaten here about 40+ times. I live in New York City, I go out to eat all the time, but there are some places that you just call home and go to when you need a consistently delicious meal."

Definitely recommend this place
2474,diiUjS6uHvbQRoiWOGKXsA,10/21/2018,1 star rating,We have ordered from The BBQ Pit several times.  Everyone loves the food -- albeit pricey.  The problem is the wait on delivery.  Minimum wait is an hour and a half and we have waited for over 2 hours for delivery.  When we call at the hour and half mark the excuse is always the same.  We tried it one last time tonight to see if they have gotten the timing down better .. but no they have not.  We ordered at 6:17pm and food arrived at 7:52pm.  Unfortunately -- this is the last time we will order from the place.  Too bad.

GOOD THING I BROUGHT I.D.ONTO FOOD: I got the entrée - Chicken breast + garlicky mashed potatoes + Mac N Cheese (+ roll + iced tea)  = GREAT.  The chicken breast was more on the overcooked side(if they made this to order then that's bad) BUT I enjoyed it anyways.  The BBQ sauce was a little TOO sweet.  The sides were A+.  The iced tea I had high expectations, it didn't meet them (3/5) It was either watered down by ice, or just watered down.  The addition of mint and lemon is great though.

Ok, fine, then call back again 20 minutes later, and the owner says I don't know where they are I said here is an idea call the driver and ask?! Never called to tell me and then when I called again to say genius you call his response, sorry I don't know what's going on! I said I do cancel the order and hung up and what do you know 10 minutes after that my doorman calls me for delivery I said no way turn them away! I will NEVER EVER be ordering from there again.

Neither was the price.I have rode past this place many a time. Once it was a soul food spot that had awarded me a delicious and HUGE fish sandwich for $2 so when it closed I was saddened. When i saw it reopen I was excited so  one day I finally convinced a co-worker to stop by. For a small Oxtail (w sides), a small 2 piece fried chicken and a Mini curry chicken I was minus $35 in my wallet. $35 smackaroos  There were two other ladies in the place, one being pregnant that I advised that the reviews said the food was outstanding to be helpful......I hope she liked her order as I did not and may have led her astray........My curry chicken surprised me as the curry wasn't yellow, it was brown. It tasted like curry but I couldn't really tell because there was not much sauce on the rice or chicken, The rice itself was a bit mushy and I had a lot more rice than sauce and chicken.My order of a small 2 piece fried chicken ($12) was actually a medium sized ONE piece of a conjoined leg and thigh. Not only was the chicken fried HARD it was absolutely flavorless. I was not happy with this at all. My yellow rice was slightly undercooked and basic af. The only thing that was decent was my collard greens, I was not going to review until I spoke to my coworker the next day and he told me that his small order of oxtail( $14) was also not good. We both agreed that the only tasty thing we had was the Cornbread outside of the greens.He is a septuagenarian (75) from the South so I can trust his judgement when he says the food wasn't good and lacked flavor. For the amount of money I spent I expected much better."

I kind of like the mystery of delivery but the next time I am craving mofongo, I will come in person to check out the restaurant."

I ordered some kind of veggie wrap and it was very good.  The service was also very prompt and friendly.I will definitlely be back to try different items on the menu.  It also looked like the place was under construction so I can only imagine what it will look like when finished.Review part 2:I wanted to try something new since I always go to cocoa grinder down the street. Coffee rx is a cool little neighborhood spot with friendly service and a good work space.  I really want to applaud their service because they were great. The gentleman even brought my drink over to me when it was done rather than me getting up to grab it. It was a small unnecessary gesture that I appreciated. They have a cool outside back patio which is unique for a coffee shop in the area. This place gets my stamp of approval. I would highly recommend.

If you decide to sit at the communal table in front of the register, you will very likely have your legs hit the metal bar underneath and eventually look for a new spot if you're working with your laptop.As for the drinks, their tea selection has around 8 teas which they have on display as test tubes which is super cute and matches their theme. It's 2.50 for a cup of tea, and definitely would come back just to sample some of their teas since they have some great smelling ones. I also ordered a pumpkin spice latte, which was lacking in flavor and tasted like their syrup base. Missing spice and everything nice that is fall. Definitely nowhere close to starbuck's PSL or 12 corners'. Staff here are great, but if I had to choose a study spot I prefer cocoa's across the street for better tables and unlimited coffee. If i'm planning on simply drinking tea or sticking to 1 cup (they serve toby's estate) for my work session, I'd come to coffee rx."

I was surprised by how sweet and watery that sauce was. You can even go an airport restaurant and get better Italian. How can you make Italian food flavorless? The meat in the lasagna was not seasoned at all. If you were to scroll through my reviews, I almost never give a 1. Very rarely because as a pretty good cook myself, I know places have bad days, there are real people in the kitchen cooking but seriously, stay away.

I noticed instead of a pasta appertizer in the 3 course someone  requested broccoli. I was not that creative but enjoyed a bit of linguini with oil & garlic. Starting off I chose the lentil soup which was my favorite- robust, brown, hearty, mainly just lentils. So much so I had to try a hand to make some at home that weekend! Mangia!"

It's a small shop with no real seating, but you can take the food to one of the tables in the hall (which overall really needs more seating) or to the courtyard outside when it's nice.I got two tacos grandes ($3.75 each) which are the regular sized tacos with double tortillas, fillings, and toppings. I ordered one al pastor and one tinga. Both were good, but Taco Mix is known for their al pastor so it's no surprise that I liked that one a little bit better, with its wonderful pork flavor and shaving of pineapple. I kept the toppings simple with onion, cilantro, and pico de gallo, and it was just the right size for lunch.Service was fast, and it looks like they have specials during the weekdays. Despite Yelp saying they were closed on weekends, they do seem to be open on weekends now, which was perfect for grabbing something to eat before braving the madness of Costco."

You're definitely paying for IC ambience but I don't mind as much since we ordered food as we were strolling through IC. Haven't been here since way before the start of the pandemic. I remembered the tacos being pretty good. They have some good daily specials as someone else posted. We got the birria tacos special, a bowl, guac, and a piña colata slushy and overall solid. Portions a bit on the smaller side for what you pay (also prices definitely have increased since pre-pandemic), but flavors were there. Glad we got the slushy because the hot sauce was waaay spicier than I remember, mind you I love and can do spice. Thankfully the slushy helped cool off the spice. It is pretty sweet so if that's not your thing, I don't recommend. It was a tad too sweet for me but after downing all that hot sauce I didn't mind. I, too, miss the little hot sauce/condiment cart. I'd skip the guac as it's a small ramekin of guac + too large bag of chips for $9. You could get a bag of 4-5 avocados at Costco next door for $9. Haha just saying. Someone else mentioned might as well walk to other local taquerias. Yes there are many good ones in Sunset Park. Yeah you can but if you're are IC and want tacos, this is a solid choice."

They had a special for 99 cent alpastor mini tacos that day, so we decided to give it a shot. I decided to try one of the alpastor taco special and a lengua (beef tongue) taco. The line was long but it did move fast. The space to order was very tight. They have a rolling cart holding their sauces, selected toppings and utensils that took a big chunk of the space. If they moved it outside, the customers can feel more comfortable waiting on line and those trying to get sauces or utensils won't be bumping to people on line. The food overall was good. The lengua was my favorite of the two and the flavors were pretty spot on. The only big issue I would have is the price on toppings. Since the toppings are itemized, the cost really adds up. At 50 cents a topping and additional $2 for guacamole...two tacos with two choice of toppings can equal over $10 easily. I think customers would not feel as upset about this if they didn't upcharge for every topping. Chain restaurants like Chipotle and Moe's that are the same style only upcharge for guacamole, which is standard,  but don't upcharge the other ingredients."

We were original seated right next to the kitchen, which we did not like so we asked to be moved a bit farther away. We ordered the clams, potatoes, the crab and tofu, a veggie dish, and a dry hot pot. All the food was amazing, especially the crab and tofu dish. I've never had anything like that and I typically don't even like crab but it was soooo good that I bit down on the spoon a couple of times. The potatoes were a let down. It was a bit too oily to eat, but we did finish most of it. The highlight of the night was having live music accompany our dinner. The singer had an amazing voice and repertoire of songs to share with us. All in all, a well rounded meal with good company, food, entertainment and flexibility. I would recommend"
2553,Xj_zTbX7_xVV9CFRSGKt8w,12/21/2022,3 star rating,"I will preface by saying that we absolutely HATED the food there.  We're used to bad Chinese food - this is New York, it happens more often than not.  But this was such a dissapointment.  The only reason I didn't give 1 star and kept it around 3 was because I'm sure there are folks who wouldn't mind the food (or even like), it was just not for our liking and to their credit, they are pretty reasonable about us requesting some items off the bills because we really didn't like the food.  At least they didn't argue with us, it seems that even some of the staff members realize how bad the food is.  We even had to stop the meal midway and go elsewhere to finish the dinner.  That's how bad it was.  Since neither of us is of Chinese background, not sure if that's really the way it is in mainland China - I understood that this was a very popular restaurant chain out there.It's such a shame because decor is nice and did like the musician's quality.  We really wished the food had been at the same level.So no, don't go for food, go there for atmosphere, drink and live music.  Eat elsewhere either before or after coming by.  That's what I would do if you must go."

Came here with a group of friends for lunch so I wasn't able to experience the live music. But I'll definitely be back during dinner service. All the dishes was very delicious and flavorful but very small portion so you definitely need to order 2-3 of them to share for a big group. Everything is mild and spicy if you like spicy. My favorite dish was the honey shrimp it was very well cooked and you can definitely taste the honey sweetness in the shrimp. Next time I'll be coming back to try the Peking duck!

Crab meats tofu was good but the tofu itself could have been more flavored. Peppercorn fish - tasty but not much fish.

Would not recommend: eggplant (main and appetizer), 18"" beef, Dan Dan noodle, fried rice.See previous review for vibes."

Count me in!Right when I found out there was live Chinese music and a beautiful interior, I made it a mission to try this place out. The inside was gorgeous, with sky high greenery, wood accents, and of course, the stage area. I can't say the same for the food, as everything sounded like average Chinese dishes. Eventually, we settled on the Husband & Wife Special, Salted Egg Yolk, Curry Beef Brisket, and drinks. We went during Halloweekend where they had a promo on their IG for a free cocktail of your choice. The Husband and Wife Special ($16) was not as intriguing as their name may imply. It was basically cold beef briskets dunked in spicy sesame sauce. Cold, dry, and not as loving as you would expect a married couple to be.The Salted Egg Yolk Pumpkin Pudding ($19) was definitely our most unique choice, but I did not expect this plate to be even larger than our saltier dishes! A toasty creamy sweet and salty treat, these eventually became too heavy.The Curry Beef Brisket ($26) was probably my favorite if I really had to choose. It had chunky beef pieces, potatoes, okra, and tomatoes in spicy sauce.The cool worker with Heelys, free Halloween candy, glowsticks, random WeChat game, and night music were the only saviors of this place for me. I do wish the artists sang more modern music though! Other than that, the food portions were small and mediocre and I left with an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach. Do reserve after 9PM for the concert vibes!"

I've noticed that they changed the menu. But before the menu change my favorite thing was the salted duck egg coated ball with pumpkins filling! I love their live music performances and the ambience. The interior decoration is absolute fire. It's a beautifully decorated restaurant that feels very open with its high ceilings/modern decor while remaining true to its Chinese roots.

Please I had high expectations before coming here and I was left disappointed and only with my love for Jenny. The decor reminds me of cafe/jungle vibes. It's a really comfortable feeling especially with a live band in the middle of the restaurant. We ordered the curry beef brisket, husband and wife special and some salted egg yolk dish. Please do not order any of these dishes because my stomach felt so uncomfortable afterwards. Not just me but my friends as well :( It's definitely not worth it for the price. The only thing worth coming here I would say is the live band because damn ok Jenny she can sing. I love you Jenny please notice me  Would I come here again ? Yes, but only after 9:30pm when the real music starts"

The menu is huge and has something for everyone. We came in a big group of 15 and I was in charge of ordering for the table. Some favorites were the garlic eggplant stir fry, the sour veggie fish stew, the cumin spicy lamb chops, chili crab seafood pot, shrimp tofu casserole. Everything was presented well and came out piping hot. The portions were big enough for everyone to share and get a bite. The live music was great but it did get hard to talk across the table.

The servers are not knowledgeable about the menu when asked what the cocktails' base liquor is. However, the food is decent but not sure I would come back since it is a bit pricey. You're paying for the experience and live music. -Hutaoli Roast Chicken (Half portion) - pretty basic, nothing special, and the skin wasn't crispy-Crab Meat Tofu - my favorite dish of them all-Lemon sliced tilapia fillet - this was a favorite amongst everyone at my table. Great over some rice since it is soupy and it has a slight kick to it-Salted Egg Yok Lobster - super flavorful and probably my 2nd favorite dish -Spicy Hot Dry Pot - the spiciest dish of them allWarning: don't order the cocktails here.

After 9pm they have happy hour for beer, which was sold for 6 at $42 or 12 at $78 and had about seven beers to pick from."

I work within a few meters from here, been coming here regularly since it had opened. I love the candied almonds (a bit pricey but relinquishes my sweet cravings), the croissants are to DIE for (I had one every morning this past winter and gained 15 lbs -also I just got married last year so give me a break :) the blueberry muffin is wonderfully moist and DELICIOUS and the chocolate cookies (esp when they come out fresh from the oven) is heavenly!I usually get the Chicken Avacado salad, although its really a hit or miss these days with the quantity of chicken they give you. I said QUANTITY, not QUALITY. The quality has always been great. A few months ago (earlier this year) they had increased the price for all salads and had been serving them in slightly larger bowls and I'm telling you- they only increased the portion sizes of the greens (not anything else). The pieces of chicken in the bowls are really scant. And its not consistent- each salad bowl has a diff amt of chicken- some have scraps, and some have even less than that. There are def less cherry tomatoes as well. The average I get is 3-4 in a bowl. Haha Im getting really down to the nitty gritty- but trust me you start to notice these little things if you eat the same thing everyday!Please Pret, increase the chicken portions slightly in the salads and please make every bowl consistent and I will post an updated review!

The classic diner decor and Greek owners and staff contribute to a cozy, classic New York vibe that I miss and appreciate. Service is fast and prices are reasonable. The servers are friendly, though I find some to be overbearing and pushy when it comes to ordering quickly, even when they're not busy. If I politely request more time, I would like to be left alone to consider my order. The Good: - Chocolate milkshake- Rice pudding- Chicken and Waffles: Favorite dish. Fantastic homemade chicken fingers on a Belgian waffle- Corned Beef Hash and Eggs: Classic, huge portions, tasty in every regardThe Mediocre- Grilled Cheese (American cheese on white bread): Very dry and lackluster, needed more cheese and butter- Mozzarella sticks: Perhaps frozen; not impressed with flavor or preparation- BLT with Turkey Bacon: Fine, but a bit dry and ultimately nothing to write home about- French Fries: Thickish fries that are fine, but unremarkableThe Bad- Onion Rings: Large, but hard and flavorless - Cheese Fries: French fries with two Kraft singles barely melted on top. An unappealing, unappetizing effort that should be replaced with more flavorful melted cheese- Butter: Tastes of the freezer Though I cannot attest, coworkers have enjoyed their Philly Cheese Steaks, Corned Beef Sandwiches, and Turkey Clubs.I will gladly return, and would certainly re-order chicken fingers, chicken and waffles, milkshakes, or egg dishes, while avoiding those dishes that disappointed."

It's exactly what you'd expect a real New York diner to be. There's no fancy frills to it. You come in, sit down, waitress takes your order and she yells it over to the kitchen. I have been coming here every Saturday for the past 6 weeks and everything I've ordered is great. My favorite so far was the French toast (they whip their own butter!!!!!)  and their California omelette. It's owned by a Greek couple and they are the nicest people. I eat super slow and every time they noticed they would run over to ask if everything is ok, I feel like I'm in their home.

Potato Salad. $8.25Fresh Homemade Onion Rings: $3.45The order isn't huge like a Katz's Deli or a 2nd Avenue sandwich but this place is not skimping out on ingredients. You get a good sized portion of Pastrami. The bread itself is a light Rye bread toasted golden brown and looks buttered, a flawless example of beautiful looking and soft but not crisp pieces of toast. The bread has a spread of sauerkraut on each side. The pastrami sandwiches are served in four pieces, two halves split open, each quarter has melted Swiss Cheese on top so when you put one half of the sandwich together, you get two layers of melted cheese in the middle and a couple of inches of Pastrami (or Corned Beef). In the middle of the platter is a mound of tasty potato salad with bits of greens. Comes with a pickle.Those onion rings are not tiny, they are the size of donuts trimmed down on the edge a bit.

2597,ezu7Ai6ADfHDYCklvuipWA,4/7/2016,1 star rating,"I work nearby and came in for lunch. First day everything was good , the service and the food. The next day the meat was cold and dry. So I politely asked to get different meat since it was unpleasant, the guy (who claimed to be the manager) rolls his eyes at me and rudely sighs. He then tells me that I shouldn't pick food if I don't like it. I said I did like it but it's cold and dry right now and I would like the meat to be replaced since I paid close to $10 for the plate. His attitude was so disgusting and inappropriate that I insisted on speaking to a manager. He stated he was and continues to shuffle my plate and food around while mumbling. My coworker and I just looked in awe at how disrespectful and rude he was being. To top it off the chicken he gave me was also cold and dry. I just cut my losses and we decided we are never ever coming back again. The food was obviously sitting all morning and was no longer fresh. The girl that served me before was great and very nice but the Asian man who claimed to be the manager has a horrible attitude. I was better off going to the buffet next door."

I order the 1/2 rotisserie chicken with mashed potato and sweet potato.(yes, I sure do love my potatoes) The food is always filling and it  actually taste good. Only setback is when ordering delivery don't be extremely hungry because the wait time can be up to 30 minutes."
2599,ezu7Ai6ADfHDYCklvuipWA,12/28/2013,3 star rating,"The food isn't always ""bad"" but the quality isn't consistent & they are way overpriced. You can buy a whole roasted chicken at most supermarkets that are the same or better quality for WAY less. A whole chicken & 3 sides comes out to just over $23.00 although the menu says $19. and change.. Their rib meal for 3 has about 6 small ribs in it of mostly bone. They're a bootleg ""Boston Market"" run by asians & west indians with an attitude. Customer service isn't good."

2602,wkrDUXKl8UHWeqacYiq53w,10/17/2021,4 star rating,Went for brunch yesterday with a friend. Here's the rundown. Pros:The ricotta toast - It's a must get. The ricotta is so smooth it's like buttah. Pairs perfectly with the apples and honey. The bubbles - Cremant D'Alsace for the win. The service - attentive and friendlyThe vibe - feels like a magical wooden cave on the inside. Cons:The ribollita is simply uninteresting taste wise. Cacio e Pepe Polenta - Too salty
2603,wkrDUXKl8UHWeqacYiq53w,1/24/2021,5 star rating,"Lovely brunch place. It was a 26F day so it is cold, but the seating area is quite comfy (although the heat lamps could be stronger). The hot cocktails are served very hot and are very enjoyable in such a cold day. The food are great too - we got the maccheroni that has a rich taste and perfect pasta texture. The Cacciucco is served hot and the sea bass is crispy and flavourful. A bit on the pricey side for a brunch, but really enjoyed it."
2604,wkrDUXKl8UHWeqacYiq53w,8/11/2021,4 star rating,"great execution, cozy vibe, high prices, small portions, unoriginalI came to Hearth for a friend's birthday. I had a previous reservation elsewhere but the online reservation would not allow us to reserve for more than 5 people and they wouldn't answer the phone. Hearth, on the other hand, allowed us to book a last minute reservation for 8 people (incredible tbh) very easily. the place was cozy and they gave us no trouble when we arrived 10 minutes late. They were also understanding when one of the party cancelled last minute.The menu was short and diverse with options for every preference. The restaurant week menu was $39 for 3 courses and two options for each course. Compared to the menu prices the restaurant week menu was a ""deal"" but I'm not sure. My philosophy on the matter is that it's the restaurant's prerogative to charge what they want, but a ""fixed menu"" format (prix fixe, tasting) should guarantee the guest leaves full. The restaurant week menu included options to add sides for a discount ($10 for green beans, garlic bread, etc.) but I believe I shouldn't need to get extras. The portion sizes were abysmally small ($24 for two meatballs) and I left hungry. The cost of food is a small fraction of the operating costs and it seems their decision to do such small portions on a fixed menu is a mechanism to incentivize guests buying extras. This is not something I appreciate.The food itself was very good. solid execution and good flavors but with an overall lack of complexity and originality. Moreover, I felt like the prices were steep for the portion size and creativity.In spite of these criticisms, we all had a great time. Hearth is a solid joint but I think they stand in the shadow of better restaurants at this price point."
2605,wkrDUXKl8UHWeqacYiq53w,7/14/2021,3 star rating,"This place came highly recommended, but unfortunately I was very underwhelmed. I really liked their aesthetic- the way that none of their plates, glasses, etc match give me a really homey vibe- it's like you went to a relative's house for dinner. Moving to the food, the menu is pretty eclectic, so I had high hopes. Unfortunately, this place seems to have trouble with portion sizes. We ordered a couple of ""smaller plates"" and then each ordered an entrée from the ""heartier fare"". The garlic bread that came out was almost a whole loaf, a vastly larger portion than some of the other entrees that came out. Honestly, the cecina was the best thing I ate all night, though it was fairly dry. The chicken was decent, but they should be embarrassed by their meatballs. $24 for three average sized meatballs and they call that an entrée?! Put that dish under the appetizers where it belongs, even if you're going to keep the egregious price tag at least let people know what to expect."
2606,wkrDUXKl8UHWeqacYiq53w,9/2/2021,5 star rating,"Wow! At my friend's recommendation, we ate dinner here on a rainy Wednesday night. Our waitress was kind and welcoming without being over-the-top, which stood out to me in a positive way. I felt that the prices were fair for the generous portions. Both my friend and I had pasta dishes that were delicious and filling. I ordered the Maccheroni with Pork Ragu which also had fried rosemary and whipped ricotta. The menu isn't huge but there are a number of things I want to try between dishes and drinks. Between the great service, ambience, and good food, there are many reasons to come back to Hearth."
2607,wkrDUXKl8UHWeqacYiq53w,3/5/2022,5 star rating,"Something about Hearth just makes you feel like you're home. The food is wonderful and well-priced for the quality meal you'll receive. The cecina, braised rabbit, and pastas are absolute show stoppers. Like Chef Marco Canora says of their ingredients: better is definitely worth the bother."

Our server (slim bubbly young man on evening of Sunday 2/6) was so friendly and fun-loving. Food was delicious, all dishes had a surprising and welcome complexity. We had the Japanese yam, cod, olive oil cake, sautéed greens and polenta. The Moscato d'Asti paired with dessert was yummy! The broth that cod was served in, so good I spooned up every last bit. And cod was cooked perfectly as well.We picked the perfect place to catch up with a friend. A+ for ambience, service and food! On my list of favorites!"
2610,wkrDUXKl8UHWeqacYiq53w,4/2/2022,3 star rating,"Food was okay, but service was below average. There wasn't one specific waiter assigned to each table, they all kept switching out. Water wasn't filled and no one came to check on us. Food took about 50 minutes to come out and it was nothing to write home about - the flavors just were off. We got the fava soup, cacio e pepe polenta, burger, and cod, and everything just tasted kind of ""off."" Took another 15 minutes to get anyone to bring us the check. Fun ambience, but probably won't return."

2612,sgbSPpsQNitp4cHXA1VbJA,8/8/2012,3 star rating,I like that this red mango is self serve but aside from their chocolate flavor I don't like the other ones.  Their original flavor for an example has this weird metallic freezer burn after taste to it.  Still when I can't get to my fave PB I will begrudgingly go here for a quick fix.

2615,sgbSPpsQNitp4cHXA1VbJA,3/26/2014,5 star rating,"Self serve Red Mango! There are many flavors to choose from, and it open till just about midnight. The fruit is always so fresh, because it is constantly finished and replaced. The store is always so clean, and offers a few seats in the tiny shop. This place is great to go to satisfy that frozen yogurt craving. Red Mango last year launched a new line of smoothies. They are all very yummy, and offer certain ""boosts"" including protein. As for toppings there are many many many to choose from. For the health nut there are fruits, and for the chocolate lovers theres a bunch of different chocolates. Red Many Bayside does an excellent job of keeping allergens away from other products. When there is a possible contamination of nuts in another topping the whole thing is thrown out as a precaution."

Top it off with some granola and honey. Altogether delicious and high in probiotics and vitamin C. Can be pricey compared to ice cream- but the rewards program and/or a membership at Bell Plaza gym offer discounts."
2619,sgbSPpsQNitp4cHXA1VbJA,5/20/2012,5 star rating,"I love that this Red Mango is self serve!! I really dislike how when they put the toppings on, they smash all the strawberries on one side, the blueberries next to it, the mangos next to that and so on & so on. I'm sure that's how their employees are trained and it IS aesthetically pleasing, but you're basically eating one topping at the time until you eat enough to be able to mix them in. With self serve, I can sprinkle all the toppings on top of the yogurt to my heart's content. This location also has a variety of toppings that other locations don't have, I think. The newest additions that I noticed were the strawberry and mango flavored boba. Just be aware that they're weighing the cup at check out, so don't go crazy loading all the toppings or you'll end up paying a hefty amount. My friend once had her small cup be over $10."

Still one of my favorite brunch spots in NYC."

No better spot than the now legendary Buttermilk Channel. A comfort food mecca any time of the day, it truly excels for breakfast. No matter what you order, be sure to try the buttermilk biscuits. The biscuits alone are worth the trip from the City (Manhattan)."
2624,f6XJQF2a5e6Z13eGclaNGA,6/15/2022,4 star rating,"This is one of my top brunch places in Brooklyn! When you're craving pancakes, you really can't go elsewhere. I've never tasted pancakes this delicious and perfectly scrumptious, accompanied by a sprinkle of sugar powder and maple syrup. We also got fennel salad which was really fresh and grilled cheese. All of it was fresh, delicious and well presented. It was the perfect balance, and we were definitely satisfied! Our service was impeccable. From the moment we sat, all the waiters checked in, in a timely manner to answer questions, order food, refill our water, and simply to check in to make sure we were doing OK. Very well run. We arrived 30 minutes before they opened, and was the first to be seated. We were a bit confused when the hostess remarked that there was only one outside table (all the way in the back side corner) she could suggest, but within 30 minutes of opening, the place was completely packed inside and out! Not sure if the hostess was also the manager, but given how busy it is and how well it's run, we understood why the hostess had to be firm, exact and organized. Definitely going back next time I have my pancake craving which is frequent!"

From the beginning to the end this place definitely deserve more than 5 stars. I really can't express my emotions on this review all the foods are soooooo amazing. I had buttermilk chicken and waffles. Omg! I still can't forget that jucy chicken. It was an enormous portion. It would definitely would be enough for two people. Coleslaw was so delicious because of the plate portion are so big, I would not be able to finish my entire meal. As a dessert I had a peach bread pudding. Oh gosh, can't wait to go back there."
2627,f6XJQF2a5e6Z13eGclaNGA,3/28/2022,3 star rating,I had wanted to try this place for years. Finally made it for brunch this weekend and I was pretty disappointed. I ordered the chicken sandwich without the bread and my friend ordered the pork chop and waffle. I think the complaints for both were the same. The batter in the chicken and pork is so thick. It's like dough. So it's crispy on the outside but moist and doughy on the inside. It tastes off. Neither of us were fans. I probably should have ordered the warm lamb salad as I originally planned. Their loose tea was delicious though. The atmosphere is cute but it seemed odd to only play music by Black artists and I say that as a Black woman. It really stuck out to me esp considering the location and demographics of the patrons. Not a bad thing just something I noted. I'm not sure I'll be back.

Portion sizes are generous! I opted for the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich and it did not disappoint. The chicken was juicy and flavorful accompanied by delicious shoestring fries (which everyone wanted to eat). They have classic brunch cocktails and a virgin Bloody Mary if you don't want to drink alcohol. Nice atmosphere and attentive service. I would definitely return and highly recommend checking out this restaurant!

I think their dinner is better than brunch but I've only been here for brunch once. The butternut squash soup is so simple but so flavorful and has converted me to butternut squash. Their ricotta toast is such a tasty combination of crispy warm and soft cool. The toast and ricotta compliment each other so well and the cherry tomatoes are so refreshing and sweet. I generally don't like cherry tomatoes but theirs are really good. I normally don't like waffles and fried chicken but theirs is PHENOMONAL. Maybe it's the cheese in the waffles but I always get it now when I come here for dinner. The chicken is also well made - the skin is really crispy and chicken is tender and flavorful. The other items are good too like the salmon and the desserts, but the above are my favorite dishes and to go to. Highly recommend!"

Tiramisu was very soft and sweet, I would have it again with coffee or dry red wine next time. The staffs were kind. 4 stars because the seating was not so comfortable even though we made a reservation. We sat on the 3rd floor(?) in the center where all the people including the waiters passed and bumped into our chairs, and the wooden floor would shake everytime anyone walks by.

Also excellent! Really wanted to try the tiramisu b/c it looked SO good, but was just stuffed my the salad and entree. Highly, highly recommend this place. We'll definitely be back.

I can't recall it being a ""strong"" flavor, but it was interesting.These days I am really starting to like the ""non starbucks"" made Chai tea.Sadly this place is not close to home or a place where I pass in any type of frequency.Store itself is small.  Since I was early for work, I thought it was a real cafe where I can sit. But no."

I think the quality of their offerings speak for themselves and do not require any additional acts ... 2021 has just been declared the year of NO attitude! How cooool is that????
2655,nDiB5GU653RzK3X2CBG14w,2/27/2016,5 star rating,Quaint little coffee shop. Servers were nice and social and the coffee was not that bad. I was looking for a place to read my book after running some errands. Honestly this is not that bad of a place to take a seat and read. The only issue is that the place is small. Only two bar stool type seats in the inside and a small bench that fits two on the outside. It's a good place to people watch a bit. The banks are a few steps down the block (South East-ish from Upright) so you get to see people walking from both sides probably running errands. I love a little sound while I am reading and this place has the perfect amount of sound probably because of its size. I'll definitely be coming back here whenever I run some errands to pop a squat and read or just want some brew. They even have a copy of the New York Times for people wanting to wind down.

It is always busy in the morning and the coffee smell is very inviting, plus the space looks very cute. They advertise their Jasmine Vanilla latte on the board and I always wanted to try it.  However, i didn't because I learned that it is made with simple syrup and they couldn't remove it. I just got a regular coffee ($2 small). Milkwise, they have almond milk made in the house, it costs extra but it is so much better than pre-packaged alternative. I don't think their milk is organic and I didn't have any. Finally, I lost one star for them because they didn't have stevia or at least truvia. They did have other artificial sweeteners which should be banned for ever!"

I stopped by to get work done with my boyfriend. I told my boyfriend to go check in the back and see if there is a bigger table available but the cashier/barista worker, who is usually always there alone, stopped him immediately and told him the menu is at the register and we have to order here first. I said we wanted to see if there was a table. He said there is a table. I told him what I wanted and he said my boyfriend has to order something too in order to sit. My boyfriend was already planning to purchase something separately so I found that extremely rude where he assumed my boyfriend wasn't going to order. Apparently, now there is a rule for each person to purchase something in order to sit. If it is the rule here, I can totally respect that but there was no sign anywhere mentioning about ""Each person has to purchase something in order to dine in"". I warned my other 2 friends about the ""new rule"" because they were stopping by later. They ordered 1 latte and the worker did not say anything. He did glare at my friends when they sat down. He was also talking to a woman in their language. When I come to do work, I do see him chit chatting with different women. It seems this time he was too occupied to stress about a purchase per person. Also, before my friends arrived, a women walked in and said her friend was in the back and breezed by him. He turned around and glared at her but just turned back around and continued to eat his food. I still gave two stars because he did not bother me after I ordered and I managed to get my work done. I love working at this cafe but I cannot stand a worker being disrespectful to a customer."

They do special alcoholic coffee (none of which I tried by the way).I ordered a chocolate croissant and a small drip coffee . My total was $9.80. The small coffee of pretty big though. The croissant was average. It would've been nice if they warmed it.  The space is small; it seems to attract a lot of students who come here to study/read. There wasn't any free wifi as Yelp had stated. The only internet option that came up for me was LinkNYC, which was unavailable."

Not full (covid restrictions were enforced) but every table was taken, so I grabbed a cappuccino at the bar to go. The owner/barista Alex took tike to chat with each patron as they passed by and introduced himself to me while taking my order. The drink was prepared beautifully and quickly. Before leaving, Alex offered me a punch card and some complimentary biscotti (delicious btw). The place is both visually stunning and had a great deal of heart, evident in the way Alex treated customers and guests.I will certainly be back, with friends, and alone for delicious coffee and to try out some treats!"

The cashier pretty much rushed us to order and it was already off putting. Also misleading drink prices. On the menu in the back it says $5/$5.25. But I ordered a matcha latte and was charged $7-8. I wasn't even asked for the size and was given a Large. Didn't even ask me what type of milk I want though they have pictured six different types of milk... and my latte was 75% milk?? The matcha wasn't whisked well and I could taste the bitter parts of it. It was pretty much like drinking whole milk too. Wanted to like this place, but unfortunately, we will not be back."

I did think the pancakes were a bit expensive at $21.95, but the portion was huge and I had leftovers. Food/coffee aside, service was amazing - everyone working here is super friendly and helpful. And my boyfriend and I were able to sit out on the covered patio, which is nice. Finally, the cocktails looked awesome. Next time!"

It was packed with toppings and made a quick bite. Our pizza was hot and fresh! They had lots of different options too. NYC pizza hits different!
2674,GjEE8vvjqb7eeHA3BGNxAw,9/12/2021,5 star rating,"Dollar slices open late, and you get exactly what you paid for. It's honestly pretty tasty and the crust was perfectly crisp. The slices are huge and honestly one was pretty filling. I would say the cheese slice is the best -- the additional toppings aren't worth IMO but they're not bad either."

2676,GjEE8vvjqb7eeHA3BGNxAw,8/12/2022,3 star rating,Not the best dollar pizza granted I haven't tried dollar pizza in so long. If they skimped any less on sauce it would be cheesy bread. Cheese was mediocre as well. Definitely not the best New York has to offer.

There's also a great tea selection with a variety of fruity green tea options. But they also have the dirtiest and smelliest bathroom in the world. I wish I hadn't gone in there. Seriously debated between 2 and 3 stars rating bc of the bathroom situation.

The food is really good and plenty for the price. Great value.It's clean, modern, and they have about 10 tables and plenty of chairs-ppl are friendly and helpful.I dined in and just they had reheated my food more + the street is super noisy and they had the door open. These are minor things so overall this place is good for a complete lunch."
2686,na_66nnEAoykJAvK-2Sh7A,6/15/2017,4 star rating,"Salmon just melts in your mouth.Came here for a quick bite on Thursday for early dinner. I got the ""build your hot meal"" ($9.95), which consists of one protein, two sides and a sauce. I went with the salmon for the protein. Btw, salmon is additional $2. So for the sides I went with grilled vegetables with tomato sauce and macaroni and cheese. I also got the lemonade and iced tea combo mix for the beverage.The salmon isn't a large piece or anything but it's the perfect amount if you're getting the combo with the sides. Seasoned perfectly, moist on the inside, just falls apart in your mouth. Mac and cheese tasted healthy, if that makes sense. Yeah it was cheesy, but it was definitely not drenched in butter or mixed in with other types of cheeses if you know what I mean. As for the grilled vegetables, they were delicious. So was their beverage with the lemonade and iced tea combo. It wasn't tart like I expected and was really refreshing.If you want something healthy, this is the place for you. They also have other drinks, a wide variety of pastries, omelettes to customize as well as sandwiches, salads and soups. I just poked my head in because I was around the area and was so hungry that I couldn't wait until dinner. I just needed something quick before I went to eat my real dinner consisting of not-so-healthy options. The build your hot meal was perfect for one. You can also share it if you don't want to get too full from it. Also, feel free to ask for hot sauce if you'd like. Overall, staff are friendly, it's spacious inside with lots of seating and plenty of healthy eats to choose from. I can imagine this place getting packed though during lunch hours. I'd probably come here for lunch every now and then if I lived or worked around the area. It's just a convenient place to grab and go. One thing I'd recommend is perhaps having the staff clean/wipe down the tables afterwards for those who don't clean after themselves."

They have a special where you can get a meat and 2 sides (daily generous portions) for about 10 dollars. My husband and I tried the salmon and jerk chicken (like rotisserie) both very good! A lot of variety. Sides were mixed vegetables, green beans, Mac and cheese. Mac and cheese is a cleaner version than what ppl are probably used to. But still good. Plenty of side options! I looked at a lot of reviews about bad service. Last few times I have been there service has been great and very friendly. Like going out of their way friendly. So maybe management took note and made changes? They also have a pastry/dessert/coffee section. And that is the reason I LOVE veritable. I'm picky with my lattes. I got an iced latte that was excellent!! Would definitely get it again. Quality coffee. But the real winners are...(drum roll)...the STUFFED COOKIES!! I've tried every flavor. Exceptional. Amazing. When ppl come into town and visit I always take them here. Warm gooey. They have a double chocolate stuffed with white and milk chocolate. A sugar cookie stuffed with strawberry Vanilla filling. A red velvet stuffed with cream cheese. There were nights where I would go to bed proud of myself for resisting the STRONG urge to walk there and get another cookie. I will say tonight my husband and I stopped in and grabbed a double chocolate stuffed cookie and brought it home. Later after dinner we warmed it up and ate it with mint chocolate chip ice cream. It was the greatest thing ever.Needless to say this place is EXCELLENT"

We made reservations for Saturday before Mother's Day not to deal with the crowds. I asked for 7 pm and was told they were all booked only time available was 6pm (no big deal) Restuarant is nice its clean looks like a cool place to eat. We place our appetizers' first than our main course there are 4 of us. Appetizers come out the special salads of grilled octopus and lobster looked and tasted very good, but the portions of seafood were very sparce. We are now waiting 25 minutes for our entrees ask the waiter he said there was a small problem with the kitchen. Finally, 15 mins later food comes out after waiting 40 mins and sitting there like idiots not knowing how much longer because no one came back to us. Pasta Primera vera was awful very salty and veggies were like mush. Send it back they bring us another dish now our food gets cold. Service is getting worse. now it's about 8pm and the restaurant has maybe 4 tables in use. We ordered desert Nutella pie special. The cook by the brick oven takes it out rings a bell and leaves it on the counter. Our waiter was no where to be found. We were sitting right in front of the oven all the cook had to do was walk 5 feet and serve us instead it sat there for 2 minutes that I timed. The waiter came back and said our 3 sodas where complementary for our wait and horrible  entree. No one works for free but the right thing to do was give us the entree at no charge not 3 sodas. I was lied to about reservation time the place was never fully booked , our wait was understandable if our meal and service would have been good which it was not. I left a smaller tip than what should have been but what I felt was appropriate for our experience. We leave and I cant find the valet person who we left our car with , but I see my car parked in front. I go back into the restaurant and ask one of the waiters if he has any idea about my car and he says no. After waiting about 5 minutes out side in the cold and rainy street. The valet guys shows up walks inside asked the same person I did about my keys and he points the valet to where my keys are. Poor service , poorly tasting food , being lied to , and now being spiteful about my keys because your tip was not as expected is a poor way to run a business. I will NEVER go back to Zio Toto nor would I EVER tell anyone to eat here. Much better places in Bay Ridge to eat that value there customers."

So I went to a different restaurant and I had an amazing time with my friends and food was absolutely amazing . Would not go back to ZITO TOTO, they sucks."

There were a total of three tables being served in the front of the restaurant. We got menus right away, but no one ever came out to take our order. About 20 minutes later my mother went to the front to ask to be served. After our order was taken, it took another 20 minutes to get appetisers ( we specifically told them to bring out everything at the same time ) because all of the food was being shared as appetisers. No one came out to check on us the entire time we were outside. The calamari appetizer had a total of 13 pieces, which is wild, considering it was about 14$ ( essentially $1 a pop?) Nutella pizza was a 10/10 always a hit. The salad with candied walnuts was also delicious. BUT There are nails sticking out from the walls which my mom ripped her jacket on while walking to the bathroom ( absolutely not safe and upsetting considering the jacket is expensive ). The server dropped and broke the oil dispenser by the door to the backyard so there was glass everywhere and slippery floors. All together this experience wasn't a pleasant one and we used to come here all the time and I noticed that when the owner isn't there this place is terrible."

The staff were very nice and courteous, they were very nice at telling me the name of their bread, things, and dishes. The meal was delicious, everything we ordered was really healthy, good, and cooked to perfection. This is my top Italian restaurant right now for Brooklyn. A must do if you are in Brooklyn. I will have to come back because I have to try the pizzas and their sauce.  The mash potatoes were cooked with a unique heavenly taste. I can not describe it, it was just really excellent mash potatoes, could not be better, best taste of the best. Their oven is fired by real wood."

They are open almost all day and night and have a wide range of breakfast, lunch and dinner foods plus great coffees, teas, wines and beers. I've ordered mostly soups, salads and grain bowls but have always been very satisfied with my meals. There is tons of seating inside. They have tables of different sizes plus couches and comfy seating and some larger communal tables. I've felt comfortable hanging here alone to work and also with groups for lunch or dinner. The only disappointment I have with this restaurant is that they don't deliver. I've been told by staff they are working to get delivery services and I hope that's coming soon :)"

Tonight after I sent my order, I had a missed call from them - I assumed there was an issue with the order. So I called back and I cannot believe they didn't pick up after me calling them 11 times!! They never answer the phone! I was calling them right up until the guy delivered. So I can only imagine what's in my bag... instead of 3 cookies they send an apple pie and they forgot my freaking smoothie. But luckily I got a straw! Called back another 6 times. Just for fun, I let it ring until the call was disconnected each time - 3 minutes. WTF? I got ghosted by McDonald's."

All I can say is this bar is a hidden gem! Amazing ambiance which is perfect for a chill night out with friends or a date night. I like that this bar is on the classier side and not too loud, so you can actually have a real conversation over drinks instead of yelling at each other across the table lolOur server was super sweet and very knowledgeable about the menu. Since I don't like cocktails with too much added sugars, she was able to get me an off menu cocktail made which was delicious! I also tried the paloma in retrograde which was also super good. They also have small plates and desserts so I got the papas bravas on the side.Overall great vibes and will definitely be coming back again!"

We'd made reservations beforehand, which turned out to be a good decision -- the place was absolutely packed. We ended up being seated right next to the door, where we stayed for the next few hours.The drink(s): First, just want to say I love the menu layout. Analogue divides drinks by ""category"" (i.e. lighter drinks, spirit-forward, classic cocktails), which is great if you're like me and only want something that's light and sweet. The prices are roughly the same across the board ($17--$20, which, sad to say, is fairly standard for NY drink prices).I got two drinks -- the Get Busy Living and the Anejo Daiquiri. I can't recommend the Get Busy Living enough. It was strong (I definitely felt it afterwards), but tasted amazing while I was drinking it, like the world's best fruit punch. The daiquiri was great as well, although the alcohol taste was much more apparent.The ambience: The vibes of this bar were excellent. There was something very elegant and timeless about being here (maybe that's emblematic of a neighborhood like the WV), but I would definitely come back.TLDR: If you're here, get the Get Busy Living -- and plan to stay for a couple hours, as you work your way through the menu!"

The servers and hostesses are nice and willing to serve + seat you, but as soon as the owner sees that you are any type of Asian, he will kick you out. When I asked why we have to leave, he said he doesn't like us. HUH????? We were dressed nicely, and we were acting in proper etiquette, what was his problem?! The other employees apologized for the disgusting behavior of the owner and straight up admitted that the owner HATES Asians. WHAT?!!?! Really blatant disgusting racism is openly accepted??? How is this place still open? Please, I'm begging you. Do not support this type of business. Instead support the businesses that treat customer equally regardless of skin color. I don't even want to go back and try anything there, I'd be too scared about what they're doing to my food when I'm not looking. If anyone POC goes and is kicked out for the same racist reasons, I highly recommend calling the police. I really regret not doing that. I was just too shocked at the blatant racism at the time."

Their roast pork and soy sauce chicken isn't bad either, but I would say just buy it by the lb, because if you order it with rice, you're in for a laugh. I ordered the chicken and roast pork over rice, they gave me a quarter of the breast and maybe like 6 little pieces of roast pork and they had no veggies left at this point. Definitely not worth the $4.75."

The Dry Sauteed Crispy Shredded Beef was neither dry or crispy and had no flavor beyond that of beef. It should be tangy with a gooey glaze. Avoid the Szechuan Bouillabaisse.

I appreciate that they put their own spin on it, but the chicken pieces were just a little too thick and not crispy enough for me. From what I've seen, photos of their other food looks good.

2749,XO43OJWeAOS0Z-hqzhKgvQ,1/4/2023,4 star rating,"Tldr: this is basically a review for the owner in case closing down your kitchen an hour prior to restaurant closing isn't your new standard....and if that is the case, that it would ideally be specified on your website or menu.I've been a long time supporter of Highwater and pretty much always get the same thing (Not your Momma's Tuna Burger and Volcano Burger). Their drinks are pretty great, and I have occasionally partook in their Taco Tuesday (which was very meh tbh).Pre-pandemic, the burgers were awesome. During the pandemic, they wavered in their quality and quantity.Now, their burgers are back to being very on point and they have been generous with their amazing taro fries.My biggest gripe at the moment (which is why this review lost a star) is because they recently changed their hours (which is a little inconvenient for me, but totally understandable since they were staying open until midnight on weeknights previously). But I expect that I should be able to call in an order for pick-up at 9.45pm on a night that they close at 10.30pm (I was told that the kitchen closed at 9.30--which closing the kitchen a half hour before restaurant closing, is a bit strange for NYC, but acceptable--closing it a full hour before shutting down is quite a bit of a stretch).Their website doesn't have any mention of the bar hours vs restaurant hours and it's now too late to find decent take-out in the area that's open since I had fully anticipated on ordering here tonight."

But this past weekend I wasn't feeling the typical bacon egg and cheese or chicken and waffles type of brunch. I wanted something different, so when I came across The Highwater I was very intrigued. I don't have many go-to spots in Queens but when I asked a fellow foodie friend whether he had any recommendations, he mentioned The Highwater. Having already been intrigued before his recommendation, I knew it was the one.The short of it: everything was BOMB. We started with the taro fries which come with a truffle aioli. I have never seen taro fries before, so I was immediately sold. They were so yummy! Taro is a bit more starchy than a potato and  more sweet. It made for a yummy fry especially when dipped in the aioli!For my entree, I had the hawaiian omelette fried rice, which was rice with pineapple, corn, edamame and spam topped with a soft omelette. On top of the omelette was some kind of aioli and a tangy-sweet barbecue-like sauce. It was fire! I would definitely recommend it if you're not watching your carb intake.My friend had the Kalua Pork Arepas. He couldn't stop raving about how good it was! We both cleaned our plates.Even the drinks here are really good! I had the Highwater Melon (vodka, aperol, lime, watermelon, orgeat) and my friend had the Die Another Day (hibiscus infused tequila, strawberry shrub, pistachio orange orgeat, lime). We definitely recommend both. If you're in the mood for something different, The Highwater is the way to go!ig: @newyorkcityfoodie"

If you place a phone order they rush you very rudely.  Also when you order at the location in person they very often forget you ordered something. They also advertise that they open at 7am and that's a lie, they open at 11am close to 12pm. Though food may be good, the lack of customer service and false advertisement will keep me away."

I live in the neighborhood and its a good option but they make a lot of business and I feel they should have someone (English speaking) to take food orders over the phone. Unfortunately I do not speak Spanish and when you call to place an order, the women are always rude, its extremely loud and sometimes when they don't understand you, they hang up. You find yourself repeating yourself 5 and 6 times. I think it would be beneficial for them to have someone who is designated to phone orders being that they receive so many. It can get very frustrating."

It's well seasoned and they give you about 7/8 pieces of sautéed jumbo shrimp. Their rice is flavorful. Their baked chicken is tasty and not over cooked. My orders come with a small green salad with a refreshing dressing on the side. The only complain I have is that they don't make black beans and black beans happens to be my favorite type of beans. Hospitality is great. From the person I speak to on the phone to the person that delivers my food, everyone seems very happy and pleasant."

I should have know better, because before we walked in i noticed they had a B grade, usually when i see a B grade that makes me head else where ,but since we had eaten there previously i  disregarded the B grade, i guess i shouldn't have .  When i got home i seen why they had a B grade, put it this way they have more than just roaches there. One thing I thought of after writing this review, they automatically put the gratuity on the bill.  It's usually an option on what to give this was included. We are going to have to find another place to go out for our Spanish food."

Today, my husband and I went to grab some food to go. I tried to order 3 times and each time, I was ignored because they're too busy talking shit. But when my husband goes to order, she listens and is very attentive (shady ass bitch)We waited 20 MINUTES for chicken chunks and the place wasn't crowded at all. She asks us which rice we'd like for our combo, we ask for the rice with gandules. Right before we leave, we check our bag, our medium sized beans are missing which come with our combo. We tell her our beans are missing and she tells us we don't get the beans because our rice has gandules, and that if we want the beans that's an extra $3One- you should of said we aren't getting the beans with our rice when we asked for that specific rice Second- why not just give us the option of regular white or yellow Thirdly- BEANS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE INCLUDED IN OUR COMBO!!They also charged for the little pack of garlic sauce. This place charges for every little thing. The good is good but when you leave, you leave with the feeling of being ripped off. My $17 combo (which was supposed to include beans, that I shouldn't have to had pay for)came out to $23."

Resistance is futile.It's kind of strange seeing Starbucks up along the same streets as The Apollo and Sylvia's, but there they are on 125th street along with the many old stalwarts and new chain stores that have opened up here in recent years. I guess it was just a matter of time before Starbucks too over areas like this.When I dropped in here the other weekend to get some caffeine in me it was average at best. Busy and the staff there just works with a disconnected efficiency. Got my coffee and headed back onto the streets to do some more shopping.Wifi hogs and people just sitting around charging their cell phones abound. Also seems like there are not enough tables here. It's kind of a strange set up compared to other locations. At least it's close to the subway and hustle & bustle in this cool hood. Not worth visiting otherwise unless you are close by and really need a cup of coffee."

THERE IS GOING TO BE A WAIT WHEN EVERYONE WANTS COFFEE AND IT IS RIGHT NEXT TO A SUBWAY STATION I come to this versus the one on 125 and 7th because this is a community starbucks and portion of proceeds go towards certain organizations in Harlem. There are about 5 chairs at this location and they are normally all occupied by the same people DAY IN AND DAY OUT.  If you come here often you know EXACTLY what I am talking about.  There are no electrical outlets at this location or public restrooms.

The cashier was warm and friendly, and my order came out quickly and correctly. There wasn't an overabundance of seating, but, by NYC standards, the dining room was relatively large. There, I proceeded to have a long, leisurely meal, kept company by a good book and my similarly laid-back fellow customers, at peace with the world as I watched 125th Street flow past the plate glass - a treasured experience, for all its ""everyday"" nature. The only thing that would've made it better was a bathroom (but, again, this is common in NYC).Big thanks to all the folks at this restaurant, for providing me this memorable meal.

After all, there is an arrow on the floor that signals that we *are* allowed to be making that awkward, but legal, turn into the drive-thru - more on that in a moment. So we placed our order in advance on the Wendy's mobile app, which doesn't entirely make much sense when you think about it because you still have to wait on the drive-thru which has to be one of the slowest moving in the city. As I'm waiting my turn to further cement myself in the drive-thru line, two cars pull up from the Broadway entrance. Here is the important part, they acknowledge that though my car is not fully inserted, I am ahead of them in line! Then out of no where, like Lebron's epic block to stop Golden State at 89-89 in the fourth quarter, a wild Wendy's employee appears! She insists that I am not allowed to enter through that way and I must turn my car around, possibly into dangerous oncoming traffic, and enter through the Broadway entrance! How dare she! We explained to her that we were here before the other two cars but instead of responding like a human she functioned more like a cyborg and gave the same emotionless plea to turn around. Unfortunately at the time I did not realize that the arrow on the ground did, in fact, show that I am allowed to turn in the drive thru from that way. We became so disgusted with this tyrant employee that we left the establishment grounds completely and headed for the nearby McDonald's to have our lunch fucked up by them too. Also, someone should tell that employee that the mask must go over their nose to ensure proper adherence of COVID social distancing guidelines."

A friend and I planned to go to Flatiron Room on Saturday night, but I, as always, was painfully punctual. She, on the other hand, was running late--which I knew, but I foolishly arrived earlier anyway. I had begrudgingly decided to forgo watching the rest of the Rangers game in favor of leaving for my night out. So I was pleasantly surprised to see that Flatiron Room's neighbor, Grey Bar, was screening the game on an impressive number of TVs, some of them massive. It was a beautiful night on Saturday, so Grey Bar had (I assume) removed any sort of storefront window apparatus they may have had, so the front was exposed to the street. After being an outsider (both literally and figuratively) for quite some time, I figured I'd stop awkwardly jumping around outside in my heels...by myself....and venture inside.As far as sports bars go, this one is quite upscale. I'd say it's along the same lines as Smithfield (which is actually not far from here). If you're looking for a more divey joint where pitchers upon pitchers of cheap beer are the only refreshments in sight, this isn't the place for you. But this is a damn comfortable spot to watch a game. Despite it being a Saturday night (during the playoffs, no less), I found a seat at the bar easily, directly across from a glorious flatscreen. There were a bunch of people crowded around the bar, but everyone was quite polite--more merry as opposed to rowdy. Just an overall pleasant scene. Seating options are abundant here, too. I don't know what it's like here during happy hour, but I had my choice of bar seating, a long communal table and a number of smaller, more intimate tables. It's kind of a choose your own experience here, which I like. My friend ended up meeting me here before we ventured next door, and the patrons near us graciously shifted their spots so we could comfortably sit next to each other at the bar. Maybe I'm just a jaded New Yorker at this point, but I'm not used to this kind of etiquette at a sports bar. Cheers!"

Their menu had a ton of great choices for salads, sandwiches, & light meals, so we were pretty pleased. It was a little quiet -- maybe 3-4 other parties dining, but we were very off-peak so I wasn't surprised. We were given the option of sitting at a hightop or regular table, and we chose a regular table near the back of the restaurant. It was cozy & comfortable, and there were at least two TVs within our line of sight. The room itself was really nice. Lots of wood, with beer bottle chandeliers over the bar area. Very comfortable!I ordered a glass of Prosecco & a Caesar Salad with Grilled Chicken. I was so surprised when the waitress brought over a mini bottle of Prosecco & popped the cork at the table! I felt so special -- plus that little bottle was like two glasses' worth! Makes it a definite bargain for $10 in NYC. I really loved the little bottle!My salad came out so organized! When I first saw it, I said, ""I love how orderly it is!"" Check out the picture & you'll know what I mean. But presentation goes a long way, and they had me with this one. It was served on the cutest little triangle plate that I kiiiinda wanted to take home with me. But a meal is not based on looks alone, amirite? The chicken was grilled with some spices, and it almost had a little kick to it. The lettuce was very fresh, the grated cheese was generous, and the salad was very lightly dressed (so as not to compete with the grilled chicken). I suspect the croutons are made fresh, becaue they looked & tasted like they were made in-house. Lightly fried, with just the right amount of crunch. Overall, I was really pleased with the flavor, the portion, & the presentation!My mom was also pleased with her Cod Sandwich (the day's special - similar to the Fish & Chips but on a soft bun) & hot tea (several flavors available). Our server was really sweet & attentive. We never wanted for anything, & we left very satisfied. Just as we were leaving, they dimmed the lights & started putting tealight candles on the tables for Happy Hour.We had a great time here. Come for Happy Hour ... but come for lunch, too.

It's very small and its proximity to the big box stores and highways makes it high traffic Starbucks especially for its size. So every time I've ever had to go to this particular location there's usually never any seats, or it's just way too loud because of all the people in there and noise bouncing off the walls of such a small Starbucks, it's just not a place I recommend if you're trying to get some work done.It's more of an in-and-out kind of place, seriously.

It's convenient for me and if you know the best way to get into the lot (which is the back) it's easy to park and has a huge parking lot. Not once has staff ever been unfriendly with me or messed up my drink. Tbh this is one of the best starbucks I've been to in terms of drink quality. Yeah it may be a little small but thats just the size of the store. They have a bathroom and McDonald's is right next door.
2803,zxQZWC0ZsEl-ypogqXDNZA,4/15/2018,1 star rating,They always have to re-do my coffee I just came here when I'm in the shopping center. But this is one of the worst Starbucks in queens. The coffee was pure milk. I want coffee not drink milk. If I wanted milk I would just stay home.
2804,zxQZWC0ZsEl-ypogqXDNZA,6/19/2017,3 star rating,This Starbucks seems quite clean.  Everywhere except the floor on the square tables area..   I was there since 11:30 AM.  How could it be that dirty already? It seems like they haven't mop the side of the floor for weeks.  The service was good and nice staffs.  However my poor laptop charger was on the dirty stained floor for 6 hours.  Oh wells...

We really did love them. The hostess was not as friendly but we had little interactions with her. We ordered the French toast with strawberry jam for the table. Highly recommended doing this. It's savory and sweet with butter on the side. The chicken sandwich. VERY GOOD! Crispy chicken with tomato and lettuce. The bun was lightly toasted. Everyone's dish was amazing. (Minor flaw, the bathroom. It was not kept when we were there. They had a plumbing issue which thank god we had already eaten. I wish they put a sign up or closed the one bathroom off. It was a gross sight and made us feel icky.)"

We went around 8 ish and was seated right away (on a weekday), people were starting to leave so it got a lot more spacious at night. We started of with the French Onion Soup and Escargot. Both were scorching hot but so delicious. Their french onion is one of the best I've ever had in NY. It's super hot and cheesey and full of flavor. The butter escargot comes with a side of bread to soak up all that buttery goodness. It's so indulgent but totalllllly worth it.The steak frites and the mussels both came with fries. Move over McDonald's because these fries are perfectly salted and crispy. The mussels were big, plump and fresh. We were so full by the end of this meal but the creme brulee was just calling my name. We are half it is was still phenomenal. I totally want to come back to try their other menu items! You can't go wrong here!!"

I loved the unique tables and chairs. I was the first of my party to arrive but thankfully the host seated me since they were only a few minutes away and I did not want to forfeit our reservations. Our server greeted us warmly and gave us a rundown of the specials like the waffle meal that did not have a turkey substitution. Bummer! It really sounded oh so good. I ultimately ordered the avocado toast (avocado toast, a poached egg, with a chickpea and tomato salad) for $13.50. Mmm...DELICIOUS! It looked good, tasted great, and left me savoring every bite."

Only 10 minutes away from the Brooklyn Bridge, this restuarant is accissible by car, subway, or even walking. It has outdoor and indoor seating.I enjoyed a delicious cocktail with a cheecky name called the ""ménage à trois"". It is a blend of gin, vermouth, and champagne. I highly recommend it with the salmon and ratatouille. (The ratatouille was more than worthy of a compliment to chef.)Their dessert menu is limited. However, their chocolate mousse with fresh strawberries complimented an excellent meal."

Overcooked mussels and some fishy tasting ones too, chicken was dry and overcooked, swordfish was dry(hard!) and overcooked. The cocktails were great, the sauces and veggies surrounding the dish were great but whoever was cooking the protein didnt seem to know how badly they were treating the ingredients.Such a shame because this was an excellent restaurant."

It's not your high-end fancy French place but food was very good. We had duck, foie gras, a couple of salads and something else. All quite enjoyable.About the service: waitress could not have been sweeter, but she was inattentive. Multiple times, I had to look around and wave for her and we were the very first patrons that evening. That said, by end of meal, host (maybe the owner?) was refilling our wine glasses for free (boosting my rating back to 4, after thinking 3)"

My friends and I sat outside and they had a cute area set up with plants and a covering to protect from any rain. The service was very friendly!There were a lot of good options on the menu to choose from. I ended up with the eggs Benedict and it was one of the best I've ever had!I also had a delicious cocktail that had just the right amount of sweetness without being too sweet.Would love to come back here for another brunch or maybe dinner!

Guys I need y'all to get it together I hate to give this place a poor rating but I'm a friend of management and I need them to succeed and not get complacent. This place was supposed to be booming as the only quality pizza spot around that's not commercial. Let's go get this pizza back to what it was get your A grade are start slinging those pies like the community needs you to do.

I watch the White Guy who speaks like he is the  owner on 2 different occasions. First time he  took a slice of pizza back from a Customer who was at his table of about five people. The customer return because his wife decided she didn't want any toppings. He put it back on the Pizza tray. Second time, instead of letting the cashier take the money and make change he did it. Then, turn around and tried to put cheese on My Mother's beef pattie. When I said something about it, he told me to call 311 or  911 who cares. Well I do so, I call 311 and the health department for Restaurant's. What you don't see or know may not bother you but, now you know. Good luck to you all who continue to eat there."

2825,GPI75p99Bjt5FvmD92YifA,12/10/2016,1 star rating,I did not enjoy my delivery experience . 1. It took two hours for my pizza to get here and when I asked she said it take about 35 minutes or less. If she told me it takes about 1 to two hours when I asked her I definitely would not mind . Another thing is they forgot my ranch when I payed for it! Unbelievable I'm very disappointed in the pizza as well. I order the Sicilian Fresca pizza and I would give it a 4/10 the crust was soggy and too doughy also to mention that I found a piece of skin from a onion in my pizza when there was no onions on it to begin with? Ridiculous. Last but not least the delivery guy spent 5 minutes arguing with me about my change because he doesn't know how to count and took more money than he should have . I really do NOT recommend this place

Pickled cucumbers - spot on, yes Pea shoots - amazing I scraped this plate clean Sesame noodles - mushrooms owned this dish in the best way Clams & basil - the best broth, wow Zhajiangmian - could have done without, great lamb and spice but the noodles aren't my favoriteBeef roll - a classic with a gourmet twist wowWu yu zi mian - HOLY WHAT FAVORITE THING, WHAT?!I didn't order the o-a Jian because I don't like it but I tried this in Taiwan when I lived there and was told this is THEE most famous Taiwanese street food dish. And I rarely/never see it in the US. so once I saw this on the menu I was like oh this place is for real. Ya know, a lot of places just serve dishes that Americans will like and give it that Panda Express American twist but it was just so nice to see authentic gourmet Taiwanese-American restaurant."

Let's talk about the menu, before I went for my first time I thought Win Son was going to be a hole in the wall and authentic. Little did I know it was the hottest place in Williamsburg for people with taste. The bites range in size, but favor a savory side. If you're looking for more Taiwanese noodle dishes I would say go to the restaurant and not the bakery. The bakery sports amazing scallion pancakes with a western twist. They are my current fave. And their cocktails are not bad! Being a bartender myself...I approve. I have to get my day started, but basically I love love win son."

We got a variety of apps that were all delicious! I got the tofu and rice dish which honestly wasn't what I expected--it was mostly a huge bowl of rice with tiny pieces of grilled tofu. A little dry but excellent flavor and chili sauce paste was provided to amp up the spice and texture. I wouldn't order that dish again, but I had a bite of my friend's chicken sandwich and it was probably the best I've ever had. I'm not sure what was on it but the bun was decadent and a bit sweet and it had a load of creative toppings. Prices are a little high but the quality and portion size make up for it. I'm looking forward to coming back again just to try the sandwich, if nothing else!"

I like the ambiance of this place, casual and lively and just an overall vibe. Staff could have been friendlier imo but maybe it was an off nightI will say price wise everything is pretty reasonably priced and you get huge portions. We got the eggplant, the scallion pancakes, the sesame noodles and the chicken bun,Love love loveddd the eggplant! Highly recommend trying it out since it was definitely the star of the show. The scallion pancakes were ok, nothing special that your typical pancakes although they were a lot more crispier than I like. I really liked the sesame noodles, they had a tangy taste to them that enhanced the overall flavor. The chicken bun is a literal fried chicken sandwich lol not bad but also not over the top amazing. If you like fried chicken you'll enjoy it.Overall I recommend this place and would definitely stop by again!"

We ordered the pea shoots, scallion pancakes, lu rou fan, and the zhajiangmian. Overall the dishes are pretty good with an interesting take on classic Taiwanese dishes. For instance, I've never had spicy zhajiangmian before, but it was tasty nonetheless. The drinks were also good - I got the espresso martini, which had a nice kick of 5-spice.The restaurant seems to be very popular and busy. While my friend and I were able to find seats at the bar pretty quickly, definitely be prepared to wait."

Every party ahead of us was seated, but they gave us a 15-20 minute wait despite there being multiple open tables (and no reservations). Pretty sure the party behind us wered seated too. Not quite sure why they made us wait, as the table was open the entire time, but fine. It was raining out, so going for a 15 minute walk wasn't an ideal option.We sat down to order and put in some apps, and were asked to order everything at once. Since we had just sat down, we weren't prepared to do so, but told them we would look at the menu more while we wait for our food.When it comes to the food, it was pretty good. I'd recommend the egg bomb for sure. But, not everything was worth the price tag - at $20, I expect a little more than chicken, sauce and lettuce on the chicken sandwich.For me personally this place missed the mark, but I'm glad we tried it."

Taiwanese food always holds a special place in my heart and stomach and Winson filled that place up and more. I always like trying taiwanese fried chicken when I try a new taiwanese place and chicken and waffles is my goto order at brunch so I obviously had to try theirs and my god it is astounding. Like SHEEESH I'd drink that white gravy they add on by itself. Next I also ordered their sesame noodles cuz my gf told me too and also another banger. The sauce coating the noodles is light yet sooooo GODDAMN FLAVORFUL. Take all my money winson. Even the merch was an immediate buy. I be reppin winson everywhere I go now"
2833,tYL1CC8grrrWExNtoiYDQg,9/20/2022,5 star rating,"This is by far one of the best little meals I've had in a long time. Came here the other weekend with a friend from Yelp. I've seen people review about the spot and another friend raved about it recently so I knew it was a hot spot. There will probably always be a wait time no matter what time you arrive at. We came around 12pm and received note that it would be about a 30-35 minute wait. So we went to their co-owned bakery across the street to wait in line about the same amount of waiting time for a cup of coffee and pastry. Lol. Came back and were immediately seated. It's a smart tactic to splurge a few extra bucks on customers and kill that half hour. The place is really beautiful inside away from the unassuming outside that almost looks like a corner bodega. I like that. Being in that we came for brunch we ordered a few small plates to share and cocktails. I went with the Breakfast of champions (peanut milk, roasted black sesame, el dorado 5 year rum, rum cream, and toasted coconut). Friends went with the Plant daddy (cilantro-mint tequila, matcha, lemon, simple syrup and egg white). My drink was desert in a glass. It was amazing. Not overwhelming. A bit of a kick with the rum and exactly what I wanted. Pure indulgence. The girls seemed to love their matcha cocktails. Plates we shared: Marinated cucumbers, fried eggplant, scallion pancake, sesame noodles with an added egg, and the tián miàntuán desert. I was admittedly dining with vegetarians/pescatarians but didn't mind. Just means I'll have to come back some day to try all the meat dishes! From what I tried it was surprisingly way better than I was expecting. Every dish was prepared with thought and attention to detail. The cucumbers: delicious. The eggplant: one of the best dishes both because of the sauce and the textures of it. The winner of the bunch really though is the sesame noodles. You need to order this for yourself and not share it. It's coated in a black sesame puree. It's so creamy and full of flavor. Again, all of the sauces are complex and just elevate something from being simple to being outstanding. I know I sound like a pretentious moron right now and fancy food isn't my jam but this needs to be your jam. Finished off with a desert which I would have been fine with skipping on but the waiter twisted our arm. It was a donut split in half with like half a carton of ice cream and covered with sesame and sweetened condensed milk. A bit of a salty and sweet treat because of the sesame I guess in the donut and golden sesame ice cream. All around delicious meal. Would definitely contemplate coming back for a special occasion."

In the end, I think the food was pretty ok with some being better than others but kind of pricey.Pan griddled pork buns - this was my favorite dish that we ordered. It was nice and juicy and the accompanying sauce below was tasty too.You tiao - it was okay to me. I felt like the you tiao here came across a bit denser than I liked, the sauce it came with was not what I expected it at all. My boyfriend really enjoyed the sauce.Lu rou fan - while it tasted like pretty standard Lu rou fan, I did feel like the ratios were a bit off. For the price I would have expected there to be more meat and less rice for $31. I personally felt like without adding the chili oil, I wouldn't have enjoyed this."
2835,tYL1CC8grrrWExNtoiYDQg,9/22/2022,5 star rating,"Win Son is one of my ultimate favorite restaurants! I don't like talking about it too much because it's already tooooo popular! I have brought only my good buddies and my sister here. Even during covid times, people were sitting outside claiming tables. This is not a place that you snooze on. Either arrive early, skip the whole rush and do dinner or make a reservation. I was meeting up with two friends this recent brunch hang a couple weeks ago. (Ingrid, fellow Elite Yelper and Alejandra who has returned from her California and Mexico City time during covid) My two lovely friends had never been here. I love it! Alejandra got lost and Ingrid and I got on the list. We killed 30 minutes at the sister bakery kiddie corner from here. Sure we could have gone to another spot but why? Win Son is all about being the best. So why not get the best?!The line was huge and took a while. It was probably a chunk of us from the waiting list but also this bakery is such a fantastic solo brunch spot too, speaking from experience. Then after snagging the coffee and a ""Mochi Donut"" our table was ready. The trick with Win Son is that it's best to order a variety of plates so everyone can try a little bit of the menu. I adore this menu. I'm pescatarian and I feel like it truly knows how to highlight vegetables and flavors with sauces, herbs and vinegar. It is not reliant on cheese as most other restaurants. There's levels of freshness, earthy and umami. Our Brunch Selections - marinated cucumbers- fried eggplant - black vinegar, labne + spiced cashews - scallion pancake - sweet soy + chili- sesame noodles -  black sesame and trumpet purée, oyster mushrooms,      snow pea leaves + peanuts- tián miàntuán - fried sweet dough, golden sesame ice cream + sweetened condensed milkCocktail plant daddycilantro-mint tequila, matcha, lemon, simple + egg whiteThe cucumbers are fresh and vinegary. The eggplant had this delicious sauce with crunchy cashews. I love all the parts of the tongue being awakened in one dish. Scallion pancake is a classic that does not disappoint. The sesame noodles are always the star. The sauce is ridiculous. You could probably do two orders since it's always a hit. I also always add the egg. Egg makes everything better. Dessert was a gamble but it was good but the ice cream was huge in comparison to the donut. A little less ice cream would have been a little better. We could not finish it with three ladies but others may rise to the challenge. The cocktail to me is always spot on. Love the matcha with that fresh herbs of cilantro and mint and that sourness of lemon and creamy of egg white. A perfect drink. I don't need to spread the word. People definitely know about this place. The outside is the only thing keeping it slightly quiet. The music two Saturdays ago was just right, in that old school punk vibes. Bon Appétit!"

After a day of walking around the city, my friends and I found ourselves famished outside of Double Zero. We saw a decent amount of people eating outside, so we sat down and started ordering. There wasn't a wait. We ordered the meatballs and the potato pizza. I'd highly recommend the potato pizza; it was delicious. The meatballs however were lacking in spices/flavor for our taste. Finally, the Cacio e Pepe was decent, but again didn't have the level of flavors we expected. Overall, the service and experience was great as they were incredibly attentive and brought out orders fast."
2839,vhaiRIPLJsuKWpK8M4QIMQ,12/22/2021,5 star rating,"Great pizza and great environment. Double Zero is one of my favorite restaurants in NY, not only because of the food, but because of the whole experience. First off, I highly recommend getting a reservation to ensure you can get your desired type of seating (indoor or outdoor) and to avoid a wait. Your experience starts the moment you walk in.  The restaurant has a cozy feeling, with music playing at a appropriate level, and communal seating which makes it a bit unique.  But the real highlight is the food.  We only tried the pizzas during our visit, but all the ones we tried were made to perfection. Tasty dough, delicious sauce, and varied toppings and combinations.  Additionally, the size of the pizza is relatively large, so it is easy to share one pizza and a appetizer for two (~$15-20 per person). All in all, if you want good pizza and a great experience, Double Zero is hands down an excellent alternative. My Criteria5 stars: The best food I have ever had, or an excellent option given the price.4 stars: Good food, a restaurant I look forward to trying again. 3 stars: Good food, a restaurant that I am indifferent to. 2 stars: Below average experience, will not go again.1 stars: This restaurant should be closed."

2842,vhaiRIPLJsuKWpK8M4QIMQ,1/2/2021,4 star rating,"We came on New Year's Day after working all day on the front lines for 12 hours, in the middle of a rain storm, in 30 degree weather, and after literally trying to find a suitable place (we are very, very picky) for nearly two hours sitting in the van. It was also 9 p.m at this point and we were exhausted and hungry after searching for a place that had heating on the outdoor seating that was both functional and working enough to counter the double whammy of bad weather.For starters, the staff was extremely friendly, extremely attentive and more than accommodating, especially since it was a rather slow night at most places being New Year's Day and it was not the most inviting weather for people to be sitting outside. Cards on the table: We did not realize this was a vegetarian/vegan/plant-based restaurant, which was an interesting surprise. I've gone through plant-based phases with eating, so I was game; not that we were going to leave at that point since it took us two hours to decide on this one and it was late and riany.While it seemed apparent that DZ is known for its vegan/plant-based pizzas, we went for the ""not pizza"" dishes. We started out with two appetizers: the Sunflower Caesar Salad and the Funghi Agrodolce, which is basically a sweet and sour champignon mushroom dish. The salad was HUGE. We shared that. We actually think they amplified it a bit since we were splitting this. Regardless, it was delish. I usually like my non-plant based Caesar dripping in dressing. But, it was flavorful enough that I didn't need to over dress it. I ate nearly my entire salad and part of my hubbie's. The salad rocked. The Funghi Agordolce was really good. VERY flavorful. I don't usually like mushrooms or eat mushroom dishes. But this was served with a unique sauce/dressing on the plate. For our entrees the hubbie had the Cacio e Pepe, which is soy-free and made with almond Parmesan, black pepper and cashew cream, and I had the Pasta Bolognese, which is also soy-free, served with a walnut mushroom ragout. This is where they lost us a bit. But, it was more about us then them. Jayson is used to the traditional Cacio de Pepe, which is a favorite of his. The plant-based ingredients gives it a unique, though yummy, taste. It's definitely an acquired taste. And he's not so much used to plant-based options.The Bolognese wasn't bad. It was flavorful. Again, for a meat-lover it is an acquired taste. It was really good. Would I recommend this place, absolutely. For people who love plant-based food, it's a winner. Clearly they know what they are doing, as they have restaurants all over the world. Will we be back? Probably not. But we were craving a plant-based option, sure.The heaters are adequate for winter outdoor seating IF you are sitting under them, which I was. But if you are not directly under the gas lit heating towers, like my husband, you're likely to be very cold during this season while having to eat outside."

The dough is nice and soft and the sauce is sweet but also has a nice tasting afterwards as if they added a bit of lime juice. My sister liked her basil pizza but as much as she enjoyed the artichoke! I love coming here and bringing my friends here because even though it is vegan, it probably one of the best pizza ever!! Please do not ever take off artichoke pizza from the menu, haha"

Regardless I figured I had to try it one day and if I figured if I walk and eat then it'll balance off my calories. That's the idea right? Jk. We did walk it off and hit the gym later that night. I was vegan for 8 years so any of these cool alternatives still excite me as a meat eater now. We ordered the Truffle cashew cream pie and as expected, it was AMAZING. I couldn't help but to drool after I took the first bite. Starting from the chewy crust to the perfect ratio of toppings to the strongly scented truffle creamy sauce to the choice of mushrooms. It was the perfect ending to my day. They have a ton of other very interesting flavors and I have no doubt they will be as great or even better than this one. I plan on coming back to try more of their menu and I encourage everyone else to do so as well."

Hidden behind what seems to be a small art gallery on the bustling street of W 8th by NYU, you'll find Frevo, a beautiful speakeasy restaurant.Depending on the size of your party, you'll either be seated at the counter or walk past to one of two booths. Listen, you'll have to appreciate the dark evergreen walls embellished with gold hardware and DO NOT skip the trip the the bathroom! Regardless of where you're situated in the restaurant, you're in for a luxurious meal - oh yeahhhhh!Luckily, the only hard decisions that needed to be made for the rest of the night are a choice between only 2 dishes and if you wanted to include one additional signature dish. Listen, ALL the dishes were phenomenal. The ones that really left an impression on me were:- the salmon: the cute little bite-size taco had a nice crunch- the asparagus: whoa, you can sense how fresh those stalks were!- the langoustine: I truly was not expecting so much bits of meaty lobster hidden in my ravioli- the pistachio: the perfect way to end the meal & holding onto that true pistachio flavorI'm truly lucky to have amazing friends who took me out for my birthday. If you're looking to celebrate a special occasion, I'd highly recommend Frevo. The food was outstanding, the service was top notch & the decor was impeccable! Thank you for an amazing night out! :)"

Hey, 71 years on this planet should count for something in this youth worshiping world. Frevo provided a Michelin starred experience on par with the best in the world.Skeptical at first, the gallery entrance a gimmick making me wary, but after the first couple of dishes I didn't give a rip about any gimmick.  The food was amazing, the room sultry, music continental, and service polished. I was the only uncool thing in the space. Franco, the Brazilian chef, is a future star of the restaurant world.  He can cook his ass off.  The six course degustation menu was diverse, unique, and most importantly delicious. Some degustation menus in their search for innovation forget about taste (Alinea in Chicago), but not Frevo. I loved everything, with the Botan Ebi Prawn and the supplemental cheese course tied for first place.  Often bar/counter dining can feel obtrusive, but Frevo allowed plenty of space between diners, and we felt very private. As the evening progressed, I became tipsy, emboldened by alcohol, great food, and a wonderful moment to be cherished.  I hope my exclamations of joy weren't too loud. I am a passionate human being and have no linear restraints.  Frevo was expensive, due to the supplemental items we ordered and my cocktails.  If you are careful at Frevo, the bill will not become stratospheric.  Frevo is a magnificent dining experience."

He made a reservation for 6pm on a Tuesday night (they only do seating for 6pm and 9pm and I heard weekend reservations are pretty hard to come by). I absolutely love how ""discreet"" the restaurant front is - a gallery entrance!When you ""open"" one of the art pieces, you will walk into the restaurant itself - an intimate 18 seat in front of the counter space. You will then be seated and be presented with the pre-fixe menu. Oh, I forgot to mention you get to see the team prepare each dish too!The menu itself changes every month. We went in October and had the following:Tapioca: Kristal Caviar, Smoked Eel, SakeLive Maine Lobster: Curry Breton, DillSanta Barbara Sea Urchin: Maritake, FennelMaine Blue Fin Tuna: Coconut, Lime CaviarOctopus: Lardo, Iberian Chorizo, Red PepperWild Black Seabass: Chanterelles, Vin Jaune, MisoLong Island Duck: Pistachio, Sichuan Pepper, LavendarChocolate: Cocoa, Vanilla, Salted CaramelVanilla Ice Cream: Mango, Passionfruit, Guava (this was complimentary and they gave it to us for our anniversary!)Honestly, all the food was *chef's kiss*. There was not one dish I didn't like. All the ingredients paired very well with each other. I love how they don't rush you at all and spaced out bringing out each dish and really let you enjoy and pace yourself.The service was also immaculate! Everyone knew what they were talking about and were extremely friendly. I definitely want to come back another month to try another menu!"

Now that limited indoor dining is open, I had the opportunity to get the full FREVO experience. Discreetly and so creatively, the restaurant is actually located behind a painting in an art gallery in Greenwich Village. You're first greeted by the hostess, where she then reveals the entrance to the restaurant by swinging open the painting. We were greeted by the friendly team, and because it is a counter space, you get to see the team prepare each dish and interact with them. We were treated with the amuse bouches, followed by the six-service menu. The menu changes every month and serves seasonal ingredients, so it is interesting to see how ingredients are used to craft the meal! Every bite was a pleasant surprise and left us wanting more. Aside from the food, the ambiance is also truly worth noting. The music, the lights, the air of friendliness makes you forget the fact that this is one of the busiest and most energetic cities in the world. At FREVO, you feel so comfortable and at ease, which I loved. Would highly recommend FREVO to anyone looking for a whole-rounded dining journey beyond expectations."

2854,HA5H73HvFX74Y-oqJeKrvw,1/30/2022,4 star rating,"3.5/5 stars more accurately but more notable to round up. 7 out of 10 scale. Concept is super cool and ambiance is like a romantic Art Deco type of vibes. Food was good but just not spectacular if you're comparing it to many other fine dining restaurants. People who said they'll be on a way to a Michelin star, honestly disagree coming from someone who's been to countless of Michelin starred restaurants. In my opinion, don't think it's a Michelin Star quality, but still solid food and experience nonetheless so I do recommend worth checking out once. Value of the meal for what you get is just alright, price for what you're paying to the portions and quality you actually get isn't on par compared to other Michelin star place that are at this same price point (very small serving, slightly above decent in quality/technique/taste). However the wine pairing was amazing, truly did brought out the dish so well!Dishes out of the small 8 courses that I did love that I thought worked nicely:Caviar with tuna on nori crisp, below oyster with raw beef, sea urchin with razor clam & mussel, & especially the scallop dish with the salsify brown butter sauce topped with truffle for additional $40. Also the açaí with white chocolate mousse cream and buckwheat crisp was so great!Dishes I wasn't crazy about:The pre supplement choice before your dessert course: a shaved 36month aged manchego cheese with honey drizzle and honey Icecream. The cheese was sooo salty, it's great with truffle honey but there was way too much of the cheese and wayy too skimpy on the honey ice cream and truffle honey drizzle. My partner and I didn't think it was worth the $30 supplement for this dish. Al"

So I called the customer service number and they were closed, no answer during their day time hours. So, then I emailed and finally received a response - that I could mail the watch to what seems to be a personal condo address in Miami (I'm from Florida). Sad. Disappointed."

The order stated it would arrive on 07/12/18, but on 07/11 still had not received a shipping notification and their site showed it was still ""Unfulfilled"". I sent an email requesting a status update.  No response.  I sent another email request on 07/12, also with no response.  I called customer service and left a voicemail.  No response.  The item did not arrive on 07/12 and I finally received a generic email stating my order had shipped and would arrive on 07/16.  This means that the birthday gift will miss the birthday.  I will now go and purchase a gift from another maker and return the Miansai bracelet when it shows up.  They will never get another cent from me."

Haha.All jokes aside, I think this place was worth a quick visit if you are in the area. Its not super large but they do make good use of the space and offer a pretty decent selection of houseplants staples/basics (like sansevieria and pothos) and a few trendy/cool plants (like Pink Princess Philodendron at $120 or neon pothos and rhaphidora tetrasperma). There is everything in between like succulents and fiddles and fresh cut flowers. Its not a large space so they were only allowing two to three customers at a time (which I appreciate) and didn't try to be overbearing or overly friendly (I don't think any acknowledged me when I came in but that's ok).I didn't look at their coffee menu or prices as I wasn't looking for a drink at the time but it did smell nice. The store is sectioned off so if you want coffee you would have to go in from the outside. I'm not sure if that's all the time or if they did this for pandemic reasons to regulate in and outs?It was a good quick visit and I purchased an alocasia polly to replace the one I have which isn't doing too well. The more the merrier right? They wrapped it with some tissue paper and placed it into a decent sized paper bag with handles (convenient for if you are shopping for other things in the area).I was impressed they have several pink princess plants but at the $120 price point I was only going to window shop those!"

It is indeed a very cozy and unique cafe that's nestled inside a flower shop! While the tables are small and squeezed into the corner of their cafe which is on the far side of their store, everyone who were seated ( and there were a few people waiting) seemed either in love or seriously engaged in their books, iPhones or computers.Imagine how intimate and aromatic it can be to be sitting engaged in conversation while breathing in the oxygen enriched plant and flower shop. I was among the lucky ones this afternoon, as I sipped my delicious almond latte and enjoyed one of the PlantShed's delicious cookies. The cafe is only open until 7pm so keep that in mind, but if you are in the neighborhood or want to meet a friend in a cafe that's quiet and feels far away from your typical Westside coffee shop, you'll want to go to the PlantShed Cafe. I know, I'll be returning soon!"

Since it closed up its West 96th Street location and opened in a smaller space on Amsterdam, the same surly service that was passable in the old place doesn't quite work in what is now an overpriced coffee bar and home accessories store with a few plants thrown in. The quality and variety has gone down and accordingly, I have taken my business elsewhere."

I love the concept- part plant store (with incredibly happy plants), part super cute coffee shop with great non-coffee options. I'm a tea drinker and went for the Strawberry Hibiscus tea which was great! Not overstepped and bitter but not too sweet either. Also tried a lamington (which I had never heard of before) and that was super interesting! Will def be bringing dates here in the future."

They are all amazing. The owner is deeply expressive and full of life. Even a vendor making quite a mess had him caring about customers and calming the upset vendor.

Ordered:1) WW everything bagel w scallion cream cheese - these bagels are big and dense so If you want a light bagel go to weightwatchers.com they load the cream cheese as well. I loved the bagel. Now I'm a type 1 diabetic so word to the wise, not a great move even if you plan to walk a lot. I honestly would split one of these with my better half next time. One bagel feeds two. 2) wheat bagel w egg bacon cheese - bagel was exactly what you want. The right mix between a chewy texture with a crunchy outside. Toppings were on point. 3) coffee - hot and hit the spotOverall - This place is the spot to go to. Staff was great. Food was even better... but again just remember these aren't light bagels!!!

The bacon perfectly cooked, the egg is prepared properly, and the cheese is melted all the way through. It is also a big bagel, and I never deduct points for a big bagel.It also looks so well prepared. I did not feel valued as a customer. Maybe it was because it was an early Saturday morning, or I'm not a regular. Either way I felt rushed. There is also nowhere to sit. I had to eat this on a mailbox.Grab and go and enjoy."

I checked the open times AND called!   Nothing was said about them being closed for an hour break. So I spend 30 mins on subway to get here and be told they are closed for an hour. And rudely at that!  By the same woman that answered the phone!  So I left and come back in an hour. I asked the woman why it wasn't in the website she said it's always been this way and I should've known. Now I fear of what's mixed in the curry!!  So I turn around and look in the kitchen. The 2 cooks were smirking and trying not to laugh while staring at me. Crazy shit!   I do not recommend this place on ANY level.

I tell him yes and he comes over. I asked for drink specials  (as every restaurant has in the area), he told me that they don't offer any specials. Hubby and I order a Gin Pom and a Pear Martini. We also order wings, calamari, ribs and spicy basil fried rice......A white party of 4 comes in midway through our meal and I notice they didn't have to ask to be helped, for water or ice AND they came to their table frequently......not surprised. The chicken tasted like Tyson wings in the frozen food section at Target.  The ribs were old and refried. The drinks were delicious and the rice, exceptional. The gent slaps 2 glasses of warm tap water on our table.....ITS LIKE 90 DEGREES! I asked for ice.It's time to leave and we ask for the check. I sign and walk out.....NO TIP.Waitress runs after me on Court St and yells,  ""NO TIP?""

The sandwich I got was overcooked, incredibly dry (both from being overcooked and too little sauce), and somehow a only lukewarm in temperature despite me eating it right after I receive it.The crust was too thick and hard, it almost reminded me of those fried chicken patties you get at ball games where there is way more breading than chicken. You could definitely tell that the chicken itself was brined, and the habanero flavor was prominent. The pepper was only the ONLY flavor I could make out... which led to a flat flavor experience.Honestly super disappointed but wondering if this was a dud? It was probably one of the worst $9 chicken sandwiches I've ever ordered."

The aroma and atmosphere really hyped me up and I really had high expectations. For the 20 minutes wait and somewhat pricey cost ($12 for a single patty but I asked for an extra patty), I would opt out for the chicken sandwich from Shake Shack instead.It was definitely good but I was not overwhelmed and I was absolutely starving. It is a very standard tasting bun, lettuce, tomato and thin sized chicken patty. I am quite sure that without the second patty, the flavor of the chicken would be lost in the abyss. Just an okay for me."

I was there recently for the first time wandering around the shopping center. I was looking for a quick bite to eat that would not break the bank. Unfortunately, most of the restaurants here are on the higher end price wise and will set you back a couple bucks. The two cheapest options I found were Shake Shack and Fuku. I have eaten at Shake Shack several times so I decided to give Fuku a try.At first glance it is a regular fast food shop offering chicken sandwiches and french fries. I was warned that most of the food here is spicy. I decided to order the Chicken Burger meal. It came out to about $16 for the meal which is ridiculous for fast food prices. There is no seating in the restaurant but there are tables close by in the mall.The food was somewhat better than other fast-food options. The food portions were average but packed with flavor. The sauces are available for an extra charge. Surprisingly everything here was spicy including the french fries. I was not prepared for that. Overall, the food here is a good choice if you are looking for a quick meal during your visit to Hudson Yards. However, would I spend $10 for a chicken sandwich again? Probably not."

Loved the crispy chicken woth the sweet bun and sauce that goes with it. A nit greasy? Yes, but it is what one's expect when you go for fried chicken right?Lemonade is really good too (guess the sugar overload helps haha!)"

We sauntered in on a whim and ordered the pumpkin mini bundt and the lemon poppy seed.We raced home and devoured both of them almost immediately. The lemon poppy seed could have used more of the poppy seed but the lemon notes were strong and complemented the poppy very well. It was absolutely scrumptious. We shared the pumpkin mini bundt which was a seasonal delectable dessert. The pumpkin was not super strong, but there were definitely notes of cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and other spices. Both of these were incredible with tea.They had a wide variety of pastries including pumpkin cheesecake, a chocolate torte cake, dark chocolate brownies that melt in your mouth (I unabashedly tried about 4 of these), and many others. Definitely come over whenever you have the chance and are in the neighborhood! It's a great neighborhood bakery with friendly staff and delicious pastries."

I was however mildly annoyed when I went to pay for it, I could not use the $5 intro offer. I was told it was only for online pick up orders which was not mentioned on the sign at all. I couldn't be bothered arguing for the sake of $4.36 so ended up paying normally. Other than that it's not a bad place. Just wished they would have been clearer on their offering."

I think the lack of seating kept me away as I am a sucker for cute cafes. However, I'm starting to realize this place gives me major Italy nostalgia in a time when traveling there is off limits.The cappuccinos are as close to a Rome bar as you can get in Manhattan-- have any other italy-lovers realized you can't get a decent Italian style espresso drink in the city?The pastries aren't Italian in the slightest but they're enough to keep my stomach satisfied at work and being that they're only 2 bucks, I always end up indulging. The iced coffee is pleasantly strong and gives me a pep in my step for work each day. I can see how in the summer grabbing a Capp to go and sitting in st Catherine's park could help soothe my Rome-sickness.And best of all, the service is always quick and super super friendly.Sorry for the essay, just shows how powerful the coffee really is!"
2942,8ptywurhx5lYbXB0TmjMFQ,5/5/2021,4 star rating,I enjoy the drinks. The hot coffee is strong and delicious and the cold drinks are refreshing but I'll take a pass with the food.  I also had the experience with the food of advertising something then when you order it you are told they don't have it.  I settled for the multigrain omelet because what I wanted was not available and it was not delicious I had a few other things and all were mediocre so I just stick with drinks now. For $2.00 using the Matto app on the Upper East side it can't be beat. I also don't like that when you put specific instructions in the box on the app for your order the people working there don't read them.  If they are not able to do specific things then they should modify the app so that box is no longer there

They have half sandwiches (which they can heat up for you), pastries, coffee (small or large, either size is also same price), and cold drinks. This is my go-to place when I'm at school, craving a cheap and moderately filling meal. Usually just 2 of their half sandwiches can be filling enough. I like that it's cheap and quick, but their foods can be hit or miss for me. The spinach lasagna is a tad bland, while their feta cheese lasagna hits the spot. Always a favorite, especially when toasted and eaten hot. I also really love their pistachio walnut muffins! I don't eat muffins too often, but I had to try pistachio when I first saw it. Was not disappointed as the flavor was spot on. You can smell the pistachio, taste the pistachio, and you can most definitely tell it, from the vibrant green color. A must try if you ever stop by. Also, if you get and add $20 to your Matto card, you get a free cup of coffee."

Everything is well made and each item - no matter what - will only cost you 2$.You think I'm messing with you? Well, I'm not: whether you'd like a croissant, a slice of cake, a brownie, or a feta lasagna, each item you select will have the same price. The quality is honestly pretty good, and their latte is pretty yummy too - I also appreciate that they have a few different locations so you can pick the one closest to you! Definitely a place you need to be on the lookout for, even if just for a something quick to recharge fromA walk around the city! Will definitely be back for more!"

We were seated immediately. The ambience is modern yet intimate and sophisticated. Their menu isn't large, but has all the right things. An eclectic selection of different types of pastas and a few options for those who opt out of pasta. But please, get the pasta here!* Arancini - 4 largely sized risotto balls with a cube of mozzarella inside. So so yummy! * Spring Green Caesar - because you can't go wrong with a Caesar salad. It was a pretty large portion as well, great for sharing! * Gemelli - love love love. The pasta was cooked perfectly and you could really tell all the ingredients were fresh. Not too heavy either if you're looking for a lighter option * Campanelle - also a great option if you like sausage! Pasta was perfect and flavors were great * Panna Cotta - MUST GET. I cannot wait to come back for this. It's topped with honeycomb which gives it the perfect crunch and sweetness Food arrived really quickly, service was on par, and prices are extremely reasonable as well! We were shocked our bill was under $200 including 2 apps, 2 entrees, a dessert, bottle of wine and espresso!"

I don't know why I haven't come here before considering I'm always in the neighborhood. Everything we ordered did not disappoint. To start we had focaccia and for mains we order the wild boar and rabbit pasta. For drinks we both ordered the Pera cocktail. To finish we shared the olive oil cake. Its quite evident that everything is made fresh and well prepared.The ambiance is dim lit, intimate and not pretentious at all. We were pretty casually dressed but I can see someone coming here for date night. I will definitely be back to try out some of the other options on the menu."

The ingredients are clearly of high quality, and the wine pairing are PHENOMENAL. I came here for dinner with my dad, and was not disappointed. The interior is reminiscent of a stylish 1970s salon on a yacht, with plush woods and copper glass lamps hanging above head. I have expected the lamps to sway with the water (clearly, the wine was good lol)The service is prompt, friendly, and well informed. The other thing important to note here is that unlike various other Italian spots which basically salt bae your plate with just a tiny hint of food (ridiculous), the PORTIONS HERE ARE THE PERFECT SIZE. You'll not leave this place hungry at all! I ordered the focaccia, cavatelle, and panna cotta and seriously, each one was delicious. Paul Hollywood would be proud of that focaccia."

It felt weird to say over a Lamb but If you like a Shank don't walk - Rent a revel over to this spot asap and get your shank on. Trust me.

2951,Gpc2-sPCXlIQUrkfi4bpzw,3/2/2020,4 star rating,"Fausto is a spacious Italian restaurant at the heart of Brooklyn with bold flavors and good service. We came here for brunch, but a lot of the pasta dishes were also on the brunch menu. The restaurant was almost full, but we were seated right away without needing to make a reservation.Upscale pasta dishes crowd the simple menu of maybe 10 total dishes. However, a couple of breakfast only items do stand out. Lemon Ricotta Pancakes are everyone's favorite with two perfectly thick and fluffy pancakes topped with powdered sugar, tart cranberry compote, and maple syrup on the side for your liking. If your eating habits are anywhere close to mine, you would drench your pancakes with all the syrup you can get. The pancakes were surprisingly not as sweet as I envisioned thanks to the lemon and ricotta working together to do their job. Disclaimer: Unless you are a total sweets person, there's little chance you will want to have this whole dish by yourself. We shared it with a couple of pasta dishes to have the perfect combination of sweet and salty. Out of the two pastas we ordered, the Orecchiette was a clear winner. The pork was perfectly salty and melted in your mouth. The amount of meat in that dish was extremely generous. I'd be lying if I said there was more pasta in that dish than braised pork. The wilted greens and parmesan added to the bold flavors and I ate more of this dish than the other two we ordered. The second pasta dish was the Black Pepper Tajarin, which was okay, but nothing to write home about. The raw egg was a nice touch and gave the pasta a natural dressing, but there was not much pancetta to go around. And sharing the the dish, we were fighting for each piece of pancetta. Needless to say, we made up for the missing meat in the Tajarin with the abundance of meat in the Orecchiette. Great ambiance and fast service. We asked our server to put the egg on the side because my friend did not want it. They brought the dish as is without separating the egg, but they were very attentive during the meal aside from this instance. They also have large communal table for large parties. This is a perfect spot for a fancy birthday party or a friends get together."

Really hits the spot after a run in Prospect Park!Everything else fell flat. I was stoked about the lemon ricotta pancakes because that's one of my top 3 favorite types of pancake (after chocolate chip and Bisquik -- don't judge), but unfortunately they were flavorless and WAY too thick. The tart compote didn't add anything to it. Essentially compote over cardboard. The addition of maple syrup made them tolerable, but I still ended up throwing out most of it. Also, the serving size is ridiculous. They should at least warn you at how large they are and how it's better suited for 2 people.The service was okay, but the personalities were strange. Not super friendly. Some strange stares.Atmosphere is okay, but also a little weird. It sort of has a this-used-to-be-an-old-person-diner vibe, but they tried to update it to be cool. Maybe it's more of a dinner spot. All in all, I wasn't a huge fan. Three stars for the sandwich."

The menu looked a little more on the expensive end, but the food was definitely worth it. We split the burrata with cantaloupe and cucumber - and WOW. What a great pairing.We each got a pasta - gemelli with squash and the mushroom pasta. Both were great and very fresh. Everything was homemade, including the pasta, and you could really taste the difference.We then split the special desert of the night - peach upside down olive oil cake and wow that was so good. Great pairing again!Highly recommend Fausto for anyone in the Brooklyn area, especially if you're by the park!"
2954,Gpc2-sPCXlIQUrkfi4bpzw,10/19/2020,4 star rating,"This is a delivery review, so keep in mind that some dishes don't travel well, I'm sure the dishes are even more excellent if you're able to dine in house. If you're a big eater, the portions are a little small relative to price, but you're paying for quality ingredients.House-made Focaccia: Rosemary, Sea Salt, Olive Oil - strong heavy rosemary flavor, and perfect for sopping up the left over pasta sauce. This was crowd favorite, and despite the fact that we had an extremely carb heavy meal, we all kept going back for another piece of this delightful bread. Not to mention that this travels well. Good thing this isn't something that I can easily pick up regularly, otherwise my waistline would be in BIG trouble.Arancini: Mozzarella, Arrabbiata - The group was ambivalent about the arancini, but please remember that we ordered delivery, so I'm sure it lost some of it's crispiness due to travel times. Flavorwise, the group wasn't impressed by this, and we would probably skip this going forward in favor of extra focaccia instead.Tortelloni: Sweet Potato & Parsnip, Walnut, Autumn Spice, Fried Sage - This is a perfect fall dish, with a lovely balance of sweet and savory flavors. Buttery and perfectly al dente, even when we were full, we kept reaching for just one more piece of tortelloni. Even the carnivores enjoyed this dish immensely. This might have been the favorite pasta of the night.Orecchiette: Fennel Braised Pork, Wilted Greens, Parmesan - while not innovative, this is a satisfying staple worth ordering. The flavors of parmesan enhanced the sweetness in the tender pork and wilted greens.Tagliatelle: Braised Chicken, Arugula, Parmesan - unfortunately, this was one of the dishes that didn't travel well, and was completely stuck together upon arrival. The flavor was lighter than the other dishes, and ended up being one our least favorite dishes. But again, I'm sure it is excellent if you're able to sit in and enjoy Fausto's pasta.Lumache: Veal Bolognese, Parmesan - a satisfying staple that travelled well and warmed the soul. The sweetness of the carrot bits brought out the savory flavors in the Bolognese. This is a great choice for standard eaters, and greatly enjoyed by all. Kabocha Squash: Sage Brown Butter, Hazelnut, Pepita, Golden Raisin - Amazing, sweet and tender enhanced by the crunch of pumpkin seeds and hazelnuts. Generously portioned, and extremely satisfying. Pork Chop: Crab Apple, Fennel Puree, Pickled Mustard Seed - Sadly the pork chop didn't travel well, and was a tad bit on the dry side by the time we were able to dig in. But don't let this stop you from trying it, the flavors are all there, and I'm sure if you can dine in, this is absolutely worth ordering. The fennel puree, pickled mustard seed and crab apples were delicious accompaniments to the pork chops.Olive Oil Cake: Apple Compote - I insisted on this, and was met with quite a bit of skepticism from some of our less adventurous eaters. But upon trying it, it was unanimously enjoyed, though we all actually preferred the cake plain, without the apple compote. Olive oil cake is not as ""oily"" as the name implies, and is actually very tender, and a bit denser than a standard american cake. It's sweet, but not saccharine sweet, and even after full, we kept slicing ""one more tiny piece"" to nibble on.All in all, a great delivery meal, and I hope to be able to dine in and fully appreciate the dishes in the conditions that they are meant to be enjoyed in. However, until then, I am more than happy to splurge on these satisfying dishes in delivery form once in a while."

I read mixed reviews about this place but decided to take the plunge and check it out.It's a small bakery and once you enter, you are smelling the glorious smell of baked goods. The selection is unique, with both savory and sweet options. They were out of the almond croissant option so I went for chocolate almond instead and I definitely was not disappointed.The croissant was perfectly flaky, just the right level of sweetness, and buttery without being overwhelming!

It took the fourth bite (on BOTH ends) to hit any ham or cheese, and when I did, the ham was a thick slab of meat which did not get heated during the warming up process. I feel like the ham should have been diced and equally distributed throughout the long croissant. Ensuring the whole croissant and each bite has some juicy ham and cheese would make the croissant more enjoyable, as opposed to the current enjoyability level of 30%. The croissant ends were also pretty dry and too flaky, not buttery."

A flakey toasted turkey croissant out on Bien Cuit's tiny, overgrown, vibrantly green patio filled with aromas of freshly baked bread drifting in from the inside is my personal idea of a perfect light lunch or breakfast on a lazy weekend. Part of me honestly doesn't even want to write this review and give away this little gem. Great selection of pastries, a long list of fruity iced teas, freshly baked loads of bread, and a decent coffee menu can be found on the menu. Also, I can't come in and leave without taking a $5 half loaf of bread home with me - campagne and sunflower/rye are both great. I say if you are going to load up on carbs, you might as well do it right, but be sure to get here in the first half of the day because the cafe runs out of some of the customers' favorite treats quick."

We were in their bakery recently and on the advice of my seasoned bakery friend, who insisted that I had to buy at least one of their almond croissants, I opted to buy two! They had one with chocolate and one with just almonds, but both were the most delicious desserts  I've had the pleasure of eating since the pandemic began about 6 months ago.

The waitress handed us the brunch menu. Apparently, they were only serving brunch. The owner overheard and brought me the regular menu and said that since it was slow, I could order off the regular menu if I preferred. I thought that was a nice gesture and very accommodating, but I stuck to the brunch menu. Ordered the French toast with strawberries ($9 for two half slices). It was good, fine. Nothing to complain about, but simple for the price. Orange juice was good, but also very small.The owner also came over to fix my wobbly table, so points for that."

Unfortunately, I was not given an opportunity to taste anything else. Around 6 pm, I dropped by the bar in athletic clothes (maybe I was too sporty for the place) and grabbed a spot at the bar to wait for someone. I noticed that the bartender had dual roles - bartender and server, which I thought was a little strange. You know, maybe someone called out or the service staff was running late. Ok no worries. I waited for a bit to get the bartender attention. Five - six minutes later (without any recognition from the bartender), I asked for a drink menu and one was tossed towards me. Ok, a little attitude but maybe the guy was swamped, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. A few moments passed. A woman entered the restaurant and immediately was given a table, a menu, AND water. Meanwhile, I have not managed to get the bartender to take my order. At point, I was fuming a bit. Again, I am still giving him the benefit of the doubt, because he is the only person on the floor. Also, I still was waiting for someone to meet me. The straw that broke the camel's back. Another women came into the bar, she asked about the happy hour specials and then ordered a beverage. After making the beverage,  the bartender/server immediately went to another table to see if the two folks wanted any more drinks. At that point, I had it, so I grabbed my crap and went to another place that was little more competent with its service. Normally, if the service has bad service, but the drinks/food are amazing, then I will give a place two to three stars. Unfortunately, I can only rate this place based the service that I did not receive. I will say that some of the tapas from other patrons' tables looked delicious."

He was aggressively flirting with all of the women in the bar and kept making jokes that he was going to swap waters for vodka. Tried to push people to take multiple shots. It was my first time there and I'll never go back because of how uncomfortable this bartender made me feel. This guy was pouring multiple ""drinks on the house"" for the woman seated next to me. Before she left he asked for her name and number which she didn't seem to want to give but then he kept asking her how he could find her on Instagram, even pulling out his phone to find her account. When she left he tried to kiss her and told her to come back soon. Advice to management: fire the creepy bartender."

I was  actually here three times in three days simply because it was convenient. There is an assortment of items from ice cream, to coffee, to beverages, to fresh fruit, snacks, and their buffet offerings and made to order counter. I was mostly interested in getting a yogurt or kobucha or a banana for quick bites since breakfast wasn't an option at my hostel.  While prices are admitedly high, $5+ for a kombucha which costs $3 back home, it is the reality of being in NYC. I do question the ""I'll charge you $6 instead of 5.99 and no tax""... Do they even charge tax on kombucha in NYC? If it had been a food item, is there tax on that? I'm not losing sleep over pennies, I'm just curious if there is some shadiness going on...Overall, for my needs I cant really complain. Would stop in again for the convenience."

You can get burgers and quesadillas on one side, Korean food and sushi on the other, then in the middle is a yummy hot foods bar. There's even a cafe with pastries and cake to the left of the entrance.Notes: While I do wish the hot food could be hotter, it's maintained and replenished often. I love the jap chae!The sushi rolls are huge. And fresh.The health drink selection is awesome. I got a detox aloe water that's flavored with lychee & white grape.I've had nothing but fast and friendly service here :)"

There are also salad bars, a place for acai bowls and sandwiches. Be careful, however. Food from the hot bar is weighed, and it can get pretty pricey, pretty quickly. It gets crowded around lunchtime, and there are not enough seats to dine in when busy. The food is o.k. It depends on the day, to be honest, but if you're indecisive, it may be an ideal spot to go to get a little of everything."

They once charged me $5 for about 10 ice cubes. It was a very hot day and we ran out of ice. Out of desperation, I walked in and saw cups of ice in the freezer. I took 3 cups and it came out to $15. So I paid $15 for frozen tap water. Another time, the owner furiously yelled at one of the patrons for taking an extra packet of crackers for her soup. Stay away unless you  are desperate and have no other options."

I've had about 3 bad experiences with the staff members here. Once was asking the guy behind the counter to give me literally 2 ice cubes so I can make my extremely hot coffee more drinkable---he tried to charge me 25 cents for 2 ice cubes. Another time was this girl at the cashier who literally GLARED at me when I tried to swipe my credit card for a $5 bill. And the 3rd time was quite recent- John's Coffee Shop was extremely crowded for brunch so I decided to come here to get a quick to go brunch. I think it was around 11:10am and the mexican ""cooks"" refussssssed to make me an egg sandwich because their breakfast hour was only till 11:00am. He went as far as saying: we don't have any eggs. Which later turned out to be a complete lie- I hate saying this because it makes me sound racist but I've only had bad experiences with the hispanic/latino workers in here.

The complimentary bread and feta was even tasty. For entrees we really enjoyed the lamb chops. Dessert was magnificent. The yogurt sundae was not too sweet and the brittle on top had a different taste that makes you want to keep eating it to figure it out.

However, it was very expensive for what was offered and the food was not authentic Greek. I realize it's an upscale spin and they accomplish that with some dishes, like the fried zucchini, but some of the dishes are Greekish at best. I agree with a previous review that one unisex bathroom is a bad idea.  Our table spent quite a bit of time waiting in line, although they did keep the bathroom impeccably clean. Overall nice place, clean, with great staff and good food,  but I found it to be expensive for what was offered."

Reservation process was fairly straightforward for a group of 4 and a 2 year old.They had this amazing outdoor seating what they refer as Outdoor Courtyard... they were these 3, well lit beautiful booths, where we really wanted to seat, but weren't given those. From the time we entered to the time we left, 2 of them were unoccupied. Don't understand the rationale behind that especially when we were celebrating something special!Anyway, that however, isn't indicative of their excellent, and friendly staff that made us feel very welcome and were very attentive throughout our dinner course here. We ordered a few delicious cocktails, which average at about $18 each. Cocktails were great.We started off with Traditional Trio Spreads ($23) and Spinach Pies ($18) to share. Our server was kind enough to include an extra pie because it was the 4 of us. This plate typically comes with 3 pies. 1 star just for this kind gesture! Appetizers were good and quite tasty. Sadly those were the best dishes we had.We had ordered Pasta for dinner which included Seafood Orzotto ($36), Lobster Pasta ($46), and a Summer Risotto ($29). My risotto was really bland and did not nerai any standout flavor. All I could taste was cheese and I was hoping the snap peas and trumpet mushrooms along with mint would have added some refreshing taste... but no. It was just bland and no spice whatsoever!Service overall was excellent and their garden seating was very comfortable including a very fancy high chair for our little one! We had a decent experience."

My waitress took alot of time explaining the menu to me, and recommending the dishes that were most unique and popular.I ordered Pikilla (hummus, whipped feta and tsatziki with pita) and Spanakopita (artichoke, spinach and feta pies) to start. It was all fresh, the hummus was my favorite and the spinach pies were delicious.    We decided to try the Duck Moussaka and ASTAKOMAKARONADA which includes poached Maine lobster with squid ink linguine and metaxa bisque. I absolutely loved my pasta dish, it was decadent and slightly sweet. My friend loved the duck, and the lentils it was served beside as well.I recommend trying their gelato for dessert, I got the Chocolate Mouse option which is called Sokolatina. I loved the chocolate flavor mixed with the raspberry jam on the plate. Overall, everything was so yummy and the beautiful decor made my meal feel really special."

This place specializes in Greek food with a heavier emphasis on seafood, and reservations are highly recommended although there is an above average amount of seating for a typical NYC restaurant. The ambience here is so aesthetic, and you can't go wrong with either indoor or outdoor seating, though we opted for indoor when we arrived. We shared a grilled octopus and lobster pasta. Grilled octopus is very chewy and fresh, with sweet fava contrasting the tangier onions and red peppers. It's hard to find places like this that can cook the octopus like this as most I have tried are usually overcooked.Lobster pasta was quite interesting. You get huge chunks of fresh lobster tossed in a bed of squid ink linguini, and the sauce is quite sweet and creamy to match the sweetness of the lobster. She likes sweet food so this was the perfect dish to conclude the meal. I personally enjoyed it, noting that the portions are way more than enough for 1, especially as this dish is a bit one dimensional in flavor - mostly just sweet. Service is great: they pushed the tables out for us to get seated and refilled our waters very frequently. Although we took our time eating and conversing, we were in and out in an hour just because they're so efficient in serving."

Unfortunately, this location is always understaffed. When it is busy in the morning with commuters coming from or to Penn station - there is always only one register open. At other Pret locations when they see it is crowded, they will open other registers. It is too stressful for me to have to wait so long pay or for my iced coffee."

2998,JvnC8fPQ8fmKeJ-E1WHhdQ,12/19/2014,4 star rating,"Pret A Manger is a chain of posh little delis that caters to New York's health conscious.  I say health conscious moreso for the quality  ingredients used in their food versus it's diet friendliness. What does that mean? Well basically, a sandwich with gluten free bread filled with organic/ non gmo/ humanely butchered/  fillings can still be a fatty treat.  Nonetheless, I imagine better ingredients will still draw in crowds unwilling to join the likes of the fast food fiends. Anyway, the selection is impressively abundant. They had wraps, yogurt cups, sandwiches, salads plus a large assortment of cold and hot drinks. I took my time in selecting my second breakfast for the day - a bacon egg and cheese on brioche - cute mini sandwich which cost me nearly 5 bucks. I didn't get coffee this time cause I had literally just eaten from a food truck 10 minutes prior. I sat myself in a corner which was caved in brick walls, took photos of my sandwich and a few selfies. Shut up, you all do it too so don't judge. The sandwich was nicely wrapped and that bread oh so soft. Granted the bacon wasn't thick or hearty, but all the components made for a decent sammy.  I gobbled that thing up in 2 minutes, maybe less. I was pretty impressed by my 10 minutes spent at Pret A Manger and am not surprised this is such a popular spot to grab a bite on the go."

It's nothing to rave about as it's straightforward as it can be with their ingredients and sauces. However the best thing that they got on their menu is their mac and cheese. Their mac & cheese game is strong here. I tried their spinach one - I tried to be healthy but who was I kidding when I am getting mac and cheese. It was the right of amount of creamy. To my doctor, I did eat the spinach. Overall, it was nicely seasoned. Not too heavy or light, but just right of creaminess. If you are around a Pre A manger which there are many and you are craving some mac and cheese, this might be the job."

3006,rtivWWzG0XjUuhSrwusTgQ,4/2/2023,3 star rating,I feel like this place is over hyped. It's a nice location and the restaurant itself is nice inside. I have tried soo many seafood boil spots and this has been like the worse one I've ever had. The drinks were amazing and the crawfish dip was good. But the seafood boil did not taste good. The shrimp was under cooked. The sauce was not good. Why does the claw daddy sauce just taste like garlic and butter and its supposed to be a mix of all the sauces. The garlic noodles were terrible.If I had to come back it would be for the drinks and to maybe try another appetizer. But honestly I ain't going back to claw daddy's no more it's not worth it.

I had to ask the person that brought the food to the table how much longer it would take for the Capri of lemonade spike. He explained that there was a long wait at the bar. I had ordered over 30-40 mins before I received my beverage.The food wasn't as good as the location Downtown Brooklyn. I really thought it would be the same - really good, but it wasn't as tasty.

I'm assuming when gratuity is included servers just don't care. I asked could i get lettuce on my lobster roll.He stated no substitutions, I'm like I'm not substituting anything. If you need to charge me for two pieces of letter go ahead. He then stated i said no substitution so if you want to talk to my manager you can, i said yeah he never told the manager and then barely came back to table.

Eating here can be messy, so don't wear a brand new white shirt and have it get ruined within the first five minutes of eating as I did.

3015,rtivWWzG0XjUuhSrwusTgQ,8/8/2022,4 star rating,"Randomly, I was in the mood to try a weird type of food that I would normally not eat. So I came across Claw Daddy's menu and spotted fried alligator tail bites, and immediately rushed over to the Lower East side location. When we got there, we were immediately seated (table for 2) but if you have a group, reservations are recommended. I honestly expected a different type of vibe. The ambience of the restaurant is super gray, dark, and a modern feeling all around. I expected more of a laid back, beachy, seafoodish type of vibe. Tables are close to one another. Now let's get to the food. We ordered half a dozen of the raw oysters, baked oysters (not pictured), alligator tail bites, lobster Mac n cheese, and drinks. First, the happy hour menu (oysters, alcoholic drinks and more) is actually great and is offered everyday till 7:30. The raw and baked oysters were delicious and great! Next, the lobster Mac n cheese was mouthwatering, I absolutely loved it. The alligator tail was interesting. It kinda tasted like fried chicken bites, however, they were very salty and after a while, you just don't want to have anymore. Finally on to the drinks. The fruity drinks in pouches (CapriSuns) are extremely sweet and don't expect to taste much alcohol in them. The sparkling rose was good. The service was alright. The staff is nice in general but a little slow for an NYC restaurant. The food came out not to slow but if you want to flag someone down to order more food or even to ask for the check, you'll have some waiting to do. Overall, the food was good. I wish the ambience would coincide more with the seafood on their menu. The service could also be a lot better. But their happy hour is why I would come back next time I'm in the mood for oysters! Side Note: I know Claw Daddy's is known for their seafood boil but I've had boils in the past and it's just not my favorite. I prefer indulging myself with just oysters, lobsters and shrimps :)"

Booked a reservation for 8 well in advance for a big group to sit in the fabulous outdoor space in the back. Beautiful ivy on the wall and view of the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge, it had the ambiance check. HOWEVER, we were sat on the far left side of the space near a fence that must have had mountains of trash on the other side due to the amount of flies and occasional gross smells wafting by us during the meal. As for the food, it was pretty solid but not amazing. Portions varied depending on the dish, but most were good. The quesadilla would be one thing I'd say not get (too small), while the chilaquiles and chorizo would be highlights. HOWEVER, it took over an hour for the food to arrive even though we had the first restoration of the day. They clearly were having kitchen issues because they brought out some free guacamole, which was nice. Still, they even once came and said the food was being plated, which was clearly a lie because it still didnt come for another 30 minutes.All in all, we had a good time cuz the weather was nice and good company, but I wouldn't bring guests here again after the experience.

The food was served pretty quickly and the service was great. The salad and the octopus were delicious. The ceviche was what fell short; and for $17, we expected more. It was mostly jicama with like 5 pieces of fish."

We had someone bring over water and fresh cornbread for us (delicious by the way) and then our waiter came to take our orders. Me and my mom both had the same thing (she wants to be me so bad lol jk)....the soups of the day was chicken soup and red peas with beef so of course we went with the red peas. It was delicious and just right in terms of seasoning. My mom thought it was a little salty but keep in mind she is older. Next up we both ordered the steam snapper with mashed potatoes for our sides . I forgot that they really give you your side on the side so it was basically two bowls of mashed potatoes each when we could have just gotten one. The fish was great . My only complaint was that I asked for extra okra and when my fish came there was only about 5 pieces of okra on my plate but I digress. For drinks , my mom got the homemade sorrel and I had the homemade lemonade ginger . Both were pretty good . Overall, I had a great time and will definitely keep coming back.

My personal favorites are the chocolate chunk (classic) and snickerdoodle (so buttery and perfectly balance of cinnamon and sugar). However, I would say Insomnia cookies fulfills those cookies cravings but are a bit mediocre in terms of taste & quality. I've definitely had better chocolate chip cookies before, but the variety of warm cookies here is hard to resist when you just want something fresh from the oven! And they are a bit pricy. This location is great in terms of safety during COVID given that only 1 customer can enter at a time due to its small space & a clear divider from you and the workers."

I got a few of the chocolate chunk cookies, sugar cookie, double chocolate chunk cookies, and also deluxe triple chunk and s'mores. My friend got hers with ice cream. They were warm, gooey, and delicious. So many calories but worth every single one of them. I absolutely adored these cookies. They were soft for a few days even when I brought them home.

Great! We love ice cream sandwiches.Place smelled amazing when we walked in -- fresh baked cookies, warm sugar, and wafts of chocolate. There's a huge fridge of milk in case you'd like to have some with the cookies. At the time of our visit (1:45AM), the store only had a few flavors from their full range offered, but we were more than happy to order two ice cream sandwiches: one deluxe and one regular.Delicious, gooey goodness. Milk and cookies has long since lost its crown to ice cream, and I wouldn't have it any other way. The cookies are well made, not too dense but also not too crumbly. The ice cream is creamy, melty, and seeps into the cookies when they do. It's a perfect late night snack, afternoon dessert, and celebratory bite to eat.The staff is super enthusiastic despite the late hour of our visit, so props to the midnight crew! Y'all are killing it, and we see + appreciate that energy. Keep it up!"

Insomnia Cookies is a grab and go cookie shop, so there are definitely no seats in there. The staff members were curt like they were ready to leave their job and are tired of serving people cookies. With the workers somewhat impatient in answering my questions, I ended up picking a cookiewich - an cookie sandwich with buttercream frosting in the middle. I originally wanted snickerdoodle cookies but changed my mind (with ample time) to peanut butter cookies. In the end, the workers acknowledged I wanted peanut butter cookies instead, but I still ended up with the snickerdoodle cookies. I didn't notice until I opened the sandwich, which was after I already left. However, the snickerdoodle cookie was warm and still delicious, so I didn't mind the switch. There was a ton of heavy, vanilla buttercream frosting sandwiched between these cookies. It felt like eating a large heap of cookie cake. This definitely fulfilled my sweet tooth!"

A very refreshing start.  As up scale as the Campbell feels, I am still impressed that they have held their drink prices from $18 to $20.  Many other locations are starting to drift into the mid 20's for a simple gin martini!.  One of a kind location and the have a light tapas menu and live jazz periodically."

A visit to the animal hospital in Richmond Hill had me thinking that the only thing that would cheer me up other than my dogs health, would be some oxtail. Sonny's was exactly one mile away and the day was perfect for walkin. So, me and my pup walked the mile to Sonny's.As with all food establishments, no dogs allowed. I left My pup outside with my boyfriend and proceeded towards Nirvana. The staff are clearly carribean. The menu is easy to order from and the craving for all things carribean can be satisfied here. Doubles. Roti. Stews. at $9 and change a pop, i ordered one for me and one for the Mister. Dont have cash? no worries. They take credit card. There are some tables to sit and enjoy your food but with doggy outside waiting for me, i took the goods home. With this place being kinda far from home (40 min train ride), it wasnt hard to get home from so i imagine if that nagging craving for oxtail strikes, i can easily hop on a train. When i arrived home, i wasted no time and dug into the oxtail. Aside from the obvious difference in the amount of oxtail in each dish, (he had 6 pieces, i had 4), the oxtail was delicious. Tender. little heat. great dish to saitsfy the craving. I did not like the rice. They use parboiled rice which left the rice too soft. If i could have it any other way, i would like long grain rice. But other than that- wonderful."

I ordered the chicken roti (I did not know about the boneless option) which costs $6.  It was flavorful especially with the extra kick when you add the spicy green sauce but the portion was smaller than I expected.  The actually roti had a dryer taste han I expected but it did have flavor and it was soft and VERY fresh.  In addition, I ordered an Aloo pie with peas and a Double.  Both were exceptional even as a roti shop amateur eater. Sonny's is also located conveniently right next to where you would get off the last stop on the A train going towards Leffert's Boulevard.  If you are in the area, give Sonny's visit."

There's a chubby girl in the store that is so rude. I ordered shrimp curry and she added potato in the container without asking me. I ordered shrimp curry not with potato on the side. The container had a very small amount of shrimp and she added potato to make it seem like a lot. I wish they would say that when you order. I don't like potatoes. Why would you give someone something they didn't order?  I politely asked if the shrimp was a full order. Anyway, she removed the potato from the container but said to me ""you made me garbage the potato"". I didn't explain that I didn't want it in the same container but could've taken it separately for my family. I said sorry, paid and left. As I was leaving I could hear her complaining that I made her garbage the potato. The girl that I paid was extra nice to me as she could see that I didn't  want an argument. Someone else would've said something. After the way she behaved I didn't  want the food. I paid $13 for the food but I dumped it in the garbage. I had a wonderful day until I stepped into that place. She did ruin my evening as I went home annoyed that someone could treat me that way. Please don't support bad behavior. Go to other restaurants in Richmond Hill that will treat you with respect.

They make some amazing peppa' sauce to go with your doubles (and they do make some good doubles). But, there are indeed better (or equal) Roti-shops in the area, where you can also get wider options of better tasting WI/Caribbean food.The convenience of their location, plus their prices is what makes me stop in here from time to time. But, keep in mind that you do have options in Little Guyana (aka Richmond Hill, Queens).Enjoy (and by enjoy I mean knock back some WI beers with your order)! :-)"

I would give five stars, but the service can be hit or miss sometimes. Especially when it's busy you gotta get aggressive and literally yell out your order for them to get to you. That said, this place is where I got introduced to Trini cuisine, so it will always hold a special place in my heart"
3082,fdiQ0DmD4sfcwGQTHEanog,6/1/2015,4 star rating,I only go for the chicken curry and roti. I'm Puerto Rican but my best friend is Guyanese. So I've ate a lot of Guyanese dishes. The thing is I didn't know that there are like 5 different kinds of roti and millions of different rotis. So when I found this spot I stick to it. The roti is warm and huge! They give you potato and chicken curry with a roti for $6. I'm a big guy and it fills me up! The young girls are very nice and they will help you through your confusion. The older lady doesn't smile and always looks kind of annoyed. Other then that I love the food and will keep coming!
3083,fdiQ0DmD4sfcwGQTHEanog,8/14/2014,2 star rating,Why only two stars? The food is good but they are cheap with it. I ordered a double with everything but the filling! What! How much does channa cost? I ate only one double bread and the measly filling. Was left starving on my ride to Inwood. Do better because you have lots of competition on Liberty Avenue.
3084,fdiQ0DmD4sfcwGQTHEanog,2/28/2015,4 star rating,This is my favorite spot to get roti from. I like the plain roti and here Its made fresh and huge portion. The young ladies are very helpful in placing your order. The place looks clean to.
3085,fdiQ0DmD4sfcwGQTHEanog,1/20/2013,4 star rating,"There are still parts of queens which I have not ventured into despite being born and raised there. For the first time in my adult life I ventured down Liberty ave from the Van Vyck into what I guess could be called Trini/Guyanese town. I was actually with my mom and we were looking for a spot to get some roti at. My girlfriend had suggested to me Sybil's which is a well known bakery/roti shop in the area. However my mom who is Trini stated she wasn't a fan of their food. So I jumped on Yelp and found several businesses in the area. My mom who is an older woman (read: old fashioned) was amazed that you could locate places to eat with reviews right on your mobile phone. We ended up going to Sonny's Roti Shop. Everyone working there seemed to be Trini. My mom was pleased with how everything looked inside. This is pretty big for a hard to please matronly trini woman. The prices were fantastic. They had alot of food I've never heard before either. I asked my mom how come she never made half this stuff before. Anyway I ordered 2 roti's, goat and chicken. I asked for a bustupshot skin and a regular skin. Both of the roti skins was the size of a small blanket. They were huge! They package everything separately so nothing gets soggy. In regards to the food I ate the chicken roti right away. To be honest it wasn't the best chicken curry I ever had. The curry was good but the chicken was kinda bland. The roti skin was very tasty. The next day I had to the goat roti and it was like night and day. The goat was verrrrrry delicious. Everything was seasoned to perfection. They give you some pepper sauce which I think was home made. It was nice and peppery with some kick. I still have half of both the roti skins in my freezer cause again they were so big.  So I will be coming back here to try the other dishes. They have a ton of food selections, lots of tasty desserts. The staff was very nice. Very friendly and even made suggestions when they could tell I wasn't sure what to order. Next time I'll definitely try some."

Another favorite is the chicken parm wrap with french fries. Only down side is that some days the orders arent as good as other. Dont know if they have two cooks so it is kind of a hit and miss situation with them.
3089,fdiQ0DmD4sfcwGQTHEanog,1/5/2019,1 star rating,Ok went here for late sunday dinner. Place was empty. Ordered the cheeseburger i asked the waitress to pls make it medium also oredered the shrimp scampi. Ok so heres why 1 star.  I waited 40 min. And asked waitress if food is coming ??? She seemed anoid and came back said 1 min. It took another 10 min.  I get the most tiny burger and a very small portion shrimp scampi with 2 shrimp sliced in half so it can look like i have 4. The burger was super well done. Obviously if it was cooking for 50 min.  I returned it the waitress ran to owner he didnt care. Long story short i went to macdonalds and ate big burgers compared to jimmys. And ended up paying 22$for the tiny scampi portion.   Will never waste my time or money here again

I ordered online through DoorDash two bacon egg and cheeses and I received my order without bacon on both of them. So I call and speak to the lady on the phone and she starts yelling at me saying that I did not order bacon on my sandwiches so I then ask to speak to the manager. This is where she puts "" Jimmy "" on the phone and I explain to him what happened. Jimmy then has the audacity to start yelling at me over the phone asking me what does he want me to do because apparently I didn't order any bacon. The best part is that he didn't even know what DoorDash was when I was explaining that I did pay for it online through their service. How do you add your restaurant to DoorDash and don't even know you have it or have any knowledge on it!? Anyways I tell him that I have the receipt of my order and he continues to yell over the phone that they didn't charge me for the bacon and that I never ordered bacon on my sandwiches. NEVER AGAIN will I be ordering from here or coming to eat here!"

3099,fdiQ0DmD4sfcwGQTHEanog,6/13/2016,4 star rating,"Sakura 6.  Went here for lunch last week. It was my first time here. I did not read the reviews before going.  Was walking back from the Brooklyn Expo Center & had a sudden intense desire to eat sushi on my way to the G-train. Sakura was right there so I decided to give it a try.  My first impression upon entering was the place is a little disorganized. Two people cut in front of me & tried to snag the window seat. I politely got ahead of them, and the waiter followed, but it was awkward. Thankfully, the other customers were cool & sat at the next table. Next, the ordering food part. Again, a little slow. Loved the lunch menu though. Many choices, including Bento Box selections. I ordered some sashimi (see photo) and a lychee Japanese soda. If you've never tried it, Japanese soda comes in a Codd-neck bottle (I had to Google that) used in Ramune sodas. The unique design includes a little glass marble ball inside that drops after you puncture the top. Definitely try one at least once in your life just for the experience of opening the darned thing.  I've had Ramune sodas before (mostly while in Japan or overseas). They are great in the summer & go well with Japanese cuisine (better than American sodas IMO).  Unless you live in an area where there's a demand for it, it can be tough to find Japanese restaurants that actually carry the authentic Japanese sodas. When they do, they often have only one flavor and it's not Lychee. I love the fact Sakura 6 serves authentic Japanese soda & in a flavor I like. Finally the food. The sashimi was ok. I eat a lot of Japanese food so I'm picky. It's 3-4 stars sushi quality. The portion size is appropriate for the price. The food was pretty much standard fare. Will definitely return for another meal. Love the Lychee soda!"
3100,fdiQ0DmD4sfcwGQTHEanog,5/3/2019,5 star rating,"Simply the best in Greenpoint. I've tried them all and Sakura is the best, hands down. Everything is really fresh...the fish, the rice, the seaweed, everything is very harmonious together. My favorite rolls are salmon/avo, tuna/avo and spicy salmon. The tuna tataki, baked scallops and Tokyo shrimp are awesome too. I ordered the beef negimaki once and it was a tad chewy and not as flavorful as I've had elsewhere. The strength and consistency of the other dishes allows my five star review to remain. I've only ever ordered delivery and it has come super quickly and the delivery guy is very friendly. I'm definitely looking forward to eating in and trying their special rolls and enjoying the sake special."
3101,fdiQ0DmD4sfcwGQTHEanog,2/12/2015,3 star rating,"Whenever I am in Greenpoint visiting my sister I order in from Sakura 6. I am a loyal customer for the sole reason of how good their lunch special is. Three rolls and a soup or salad all for $14. However, I do love to dip my sushi in eel sauce, and they charge a dollar extra for a side of it, even though most restaurants don't.  I always get either spicy tuna, spicy Salmon, salmon and mango or the eel avocado roll as a part of the lunch special. Last time I got the spicy tuna it was a little too spicy, and was an odd red-orange color. I most recently got the spicy salmon roll which was much better and crunchy. The mango in the salmon mango roll is always ripe and delicious as well. The biggest downfall of Sakura 6 is the service and delivery. The service is very hasty and have hung up on me once, and forgot that I was on hold another time. Additionally, although seamless says 30-45 minutes for delivery, expect to wait at least an hour and fifteen for the food. Though, delivery times have been inconsistent and once I received a speedy delivery.Sometimes when things are super cheap, you have to be skeptical.... but it is good it exists."

3103,fdiQ0DmD4sfcwGQTHEanog,2/2/2017,5 star rating,"Sakura 6 gets 5 stars from me for the service and value. They offer a pretty ridiculous special in which if you spend about 10-11 dollars (it has changed so I cant remember), you get unlimited hot saki. Need I say more? I typically opt for the 3 roll special which costs 12.95. Good deal for three rolls which you can get as a hand roll if you want, followed up by endless, flowing hot saki which really cant be beat. Because of this special, it can get really busy sometimes so be prepared on a weekend for a little bit slower service and longer wait time. However, when I have gone in off peak hours the quality and attentiveness is really top notch.That all being said, I have been to many other places where the quality in food is a bit higher, but for the price, location, and saki special, I would suggest everyone try this at least once because I am confident you will want to go back."

It was filling and delicious, although a little pricey at $13.49. Next time I will probably get the chipotle cowboy salad with vegan chicken nuggets and avocado, which seems like a better deal at $10.99.

Seating is very nicely spread out and it's extremely cozy and intimate atmosphere.

Food was average at best, nothing stood out; however, I could totally be bias with that opinion since I was already triggered from the wait.

Today, when there was nobody else in there, I bought a small box of water, took a few sips, and put my mask back on. The unmasked owner, Matt, came out and said I could sit there if I was waiting for the bus, but he didn't want to get in trouble for having indoor diners.I said he was right and left. Several more customers walked in, ordered snacks and drinks, and began consuming them inside. I walked back in and asked him to put on a mask himself.The unmasked owner told me to leave and that he was ""very nice to me."" He said he doesn't have to wear a mask because he's ""in the back"" (preparing food) despite, at that moment, interacting with an unmasked child. One of the customers also started arguing with me, as well as his cashier, who wears her masks below her nose. I was asked to leave and did.The owner followed me to the ferry pier unmasked and told me I was no longer allowed in his store. I was afraid and spoke loudly. I said I would be filing a report. He said: ""You're not the first. You're not allowed back in my store. I hope you die."""

The menu item description says that it is served on garlic butter toasted hero with sun dried tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. I received a poor skinny sandwich with a thin piece of breaded chicken and green pesto sauce. Not a trace of mozzarella. Not a trace of tomatoes. Not a trace of garlic butter. I asked for extra mesculin greens and that is the only thing they actually added to my sandwich. The sandwich was missing more than half the ingredients! And I was charged $10 for it.I ordered gluten free marble cake. It never arrived. Instead I got a brownie, which I never ordered. I got an item that I never wanted in the first place. And was charged for it.I also ordered a macha. The picture they have attached to this menu item is a proper macha. Beautiful light green, creamy beverage. and it is topped with whipped cream. I received a cup of thin dark green absolutely undrinkable thing the color and taste of muddy water. And was charged $4.50 for it.The entire order was completely messed up. The delivery I received included either stuff that I never ordered in the first place, or items were prepared not as promised, lacking majority of ingredients, but still charged full price. I want to add that I totally understand that everybody makes mistakes. But I have never seen or experienced anything like THIS before. I mean, how do you mess up the entire order? How do you forget to include half the ingredients in an order, how do you send an item that was never even ordered instead of the item that was ordered and how do you offer a beverage that you dont even know how to prepare? How do you do it all at once in a very simple order? How is it even possible for any business to show such extent of incompetence? And how do you have the decency to charge people for something like that?I rarely leave reviews on yelp, and I usually prefer to take my time to write a good review when my experience is great. This time I was left with no alternative. With taxes and a tip for the delivery person I was charged almost $25 for stuff I did not order or stuff that was not delivered the way it was promised. And I think it is outrageous. It is unbelievable that there are businesses out there that feel okay about themselves showing such incompetence and taking people's money for it. I find it absolutely disrespectful, shameful and rude."

3170,7vl4N31vGFEJwK-qq26uGQ,7/3/2021,5 star rating,"I have lived in Bay Ridge for the last couple years. I moved here right before the pandemic. This restaurant opened up during a difficult time, and has managed to stick around when others didn't. There is a good reason for that, quality. I passed by often as I began to take walks through the neighborhood that took me through the Narrows Botanical Gardens and The Veterans Memorial Pier, which are both across the street from this restaurant. Eventually I decided I would stop in and have something like a Turkey Bacon Egg and Cheese, and some coffee. After seeing the enormous menu painted on the wall behind the register/ordering area, I quickly browsed it and decided I would get a breakfast plate and a smoothie. I've been back at least 4 times since then, trying different burgers from their expansive list. I've had their Veggie Burger twice, The Starvin Like Marvin (which I highly recommend), Their House Burger which is delicious, and today I left with the Peanut Butter Crunch Burger, and I'm still on love with the taste that lingers...I use their restaurant as my ""treat meal"" while I'm dieting and losing weight. I've lost more than 30lbs still having their burgers once every few Saturdays. There is absolutely nothing that I can say towards this restaurant that isn't positive. Matt and Jenny, the cashier's there who I assume are part of the family who run the business are the absolute best! I've had amazing conversations about my fragrance content on social media, and Matt is a fellow cologne enthusiast, so of you see him, he probably smells like a million bucks! Friendly service, affordable meals, and most importantly the menu accommodates any diet or eating preference. I recommend this place to anyone in the area, maybe after a walk through the park or by the pier, you can stop by and grab a cold drink because they also have adult beverages!If you're in the area, looking for a place to dine in or takeout, check them out!"

And for that, I'd stop over here for drinks if I'm in the area.  However, both times I've been to Blue Ruin I've had a run-in with a local drunk that has left a bitter taste in my mouth. This last time, the situation was sooooo obnoxious (and racist) that I decided it would better for me to leave before any trouble was had.  What frustrates me the most is that this patron was beyond hammered and was still being served.  He was draped over everyone else at the bar and just spewing some outlandish nonsense.  In my older age, I've learned to ignore such behavior, but his racist comment was actually directed at my girlfriend which just made my blood boil.If you're looking for a cheap drink and a game of pool or two, Blue Ruin is your spot.

Best thing about Blue Ruin is the mirror & the flags behind the bar! So good. Lots of people playing pool and having a good time - music was a bit loud, but then again, i'm old!"
3188,7vl4N31vGFEJwK-qq26uGQ,11/26/2019,4 star rating,Great vibe. Friendly smiling bartender. Lots of deals. $7 beer and shot. We have a winner as my fellow yelp friends have highlighted. They never lead me astray.

There are a couple of places within a block that charge anywhere from $13-$16 for a vodka tonic. So I appreciated their prices.It's a great place to catch a football game. They a multiple tvs and the rowdy-ish crowd (nothing to crazy).It's about a block away from a train station and there are plenty of ppl out late in the area. I would go back to watch another game and shoot some pool. Plus, the bartender Sam is awesome!"

3191,7vl4N31vGFEJwK-qq26uGQ,1/22/2017,5 star rating,"I'm giving not 5 stars because it actually deserves it but because its a fucking ""real bar"" and one of the few in this Manhattan area that has a ""come as you are"" vibe. It's VERY American so if you're bothered by the American flag, the ""Don't Tread On Me Flag"", the Marine Corp flag, 80's porn pictures plastered throughout the (no lock) bathrooms, the 666 Union Flag of theirs, the metal music then you probably don't want to come here. If this is your type of place, come on in and ALL are welcomed. I've seen blue collared construction workers, white collared workers, geeks, freaks and everything in between come together for a game of pool and beer. It doesn't matter if you're wearing a suit and tie or joggers, all is game. The drinks are always cheap and on point. 2 PBR's, 4 dollar stella's and more cheap shit. Great place to come for a pre-game or just to simply hangout with some friends. Heck, you can come solo and end up striking up a conversation with someone. For a dive bar its never filthy. At least from the times I've been there. The bartenders are always chill and tentative. Anyway, definitely come here, drink, have fun and actually get to drink and hangout instead of worrying about a bar that turns into a cheesy top 40 joint after 11pm."

I don't know, maybe you erase it so people don't get there hopes up and want the butterscotch latte...just saying. I rarely get sweet coffee drinks anymore, but I saw it, and I wanted it. And then they didn't have it. I ordered a grande blonde flat white and its was almost $6 and really just okay. I don't understand how they get away with highway robbery for their drinks. Are these magical espresso beans? Am I going to get three wishes with my purchase? Probably not. Sigh. I still chugged that caffeine down like a champ since I had more grading to do but all in all, I'm glad that I don't live or work near this location because I won't be back."

There are no fans or febreeze available, so my experience was smelly. The dine in experience is fine. There are around 25 available seats after they changed tables and seats around. It's a pretty small location compared to other Starbucks around the city."

Sorry Vera but about 10 years ago or so, I emailed them thinking I could actually open up a Starbucks myself.. Little did I know it's not a franchise... I told them Kings highway is a gold mine for Starbucks... I am just surprised it took them this long..I agree with the garbage overflowing.. I even had to mention it to the bar staff... There wasn't anywhere to throw my garbage..Well I came back today and the line bent to the end of the store and back around half way to the front!! I have never seen a Starbucks line quite THAT long.Tip... Don't come at about 2pm.. You'll wait a good 20 minutes to just order your coffee.Service was good and the place is large, which in this area is much needed. I think ugly could probably use another 2 registers. It would help the line."

I think this location in terms of lighting and seating is really good compared to other Starbucks that can be really dark. They have few outlets around the store - not many but still better than other Starbucks I have been to. Honestly, their staff is pretty friendly in my opinion. Food and drinks taste fine. The sausage egg and cheddar is better than that from the City locations. I like it. No problems for me. I will say there is an influx of high school or junior high school kids who get a little rowdy around 3:00 PM but they don't stay for very long (thankfully)."

I was there on April 21st 8pm; I was assisted by Denzel(I believe his name was) and another female. They messed my order up  3 times, instead of taking the time to actually listen to me and get it right the first time. The aggressive amount of attitude I got from those two workers there that night was disgusting. I continued to be respectful and kind to them although they deserved the complete opposite. I had to explain to these two workers exactly what a green tea latte is because clearly they didn't  know what exactly it is; they gave me a damn cup of milk. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME this happened to me in this location, but I am completely fed up and will never visit this Starbucks.They definitely need a whole new team."

She made me wait 15 minutes for my latte then called me to pick up my drink using somebody else name complaining that she can't pronounce mine. By the time I realized that this poor drink staying lonely on the counter table for a while is mine, it turned into cold and something totally not presentable. At other Starbucks spots, the baristas usually change your drink if something wrong with it, especially when your hot latte turned into left over coffee, but you won't find that here. What a disappointment, didn't plan to start my morning this way. l just left my drink there and walked away."

I stuffed my face like a child ramming a triangle peg in a circle hole. I barely removed the aluminum foil that was wrapped with and upon finishing it left a pathetic hard-to-eat-with-a-fork disgusting mash of rice and beans with its oh so delicious mystery mix of hot sauce, sour cream and oil. It was satisfying beyond belief for 4 minutes before I came to my senses of what I did. It may have added pounds to my waist and took years off my life but after the day I had it was the only accomplishment I had today. Well done Dragon. Well F-ing done."

I've lived here 12 years & ordered food from most of these places. Dragon Garden stands out. VERY friendly staff. Fast delivery. The food is fresh & delicious. I am a huge fan of Hot & Spicy Soup & I love theirs. Most other places serve bland glutenous soup. Theirs is spicy w/ lots of tofu. You can tell it's better when it's a darker color. Their chili tostada salad is delicious, also."

The people are so nice and i order often enough for them to know who i am. I saw a worker (or owner or delivery man i don't know what his position is at the restaurant) on the train station and he said hi and made small talk with me. He actually saw me first and said hi so enthusiastically that i turnes my head. The food is absolutely phenomenal! I usually order the typical things out of a fast food restaurant cheese fries, fried chicken wings, and nuggets. The fried chicken wings are what you would normally expect. The nuggets are actually really good and very tender. The cheese fries are awesome my sister gets them every time. My sister also gets this shrimp with mushroom and broccoli with garlic sauce with fried rice and its amazing!!! I recently started getting the boneless spare ribs with pork fried rice and i think thats my new favorite dish. If you enjoy good food and friendly people this has got to be the place to go."
3209,7vl4N31vGFEJwK-qq26uGQ,2/8/2014,2 star rating,"This place is nasty. I don't know what I was thinking coming here for Mexican food.  First of all, we were charged $23 for some nachos, 3 tacos and a small shrimp in garlic sauce.  The tacos were tasteless. They had lettuce and diced tomatoes inside.  The chicken tasted like it was taken out of a Chinese chicken dish, but then again it is a Chinese restaurant.   The guacamole taco was even worse.  It had absolutely no taste.  There was no spice, onions or cilantro in any  of the tacos.  The nachos had dried up beans on top. Overall, I know that this is a Chinese place but come on, you can try a little bit harder or just offer less food and focus on the quality. I really don't recommend this place to anyone."

It's now three months later and it seems as if it has gotten worse. The chicken and ribs are pre cut and uncovered I understand the pre-cutting but uncovered? The meat looked dry and overcooked so I waited for them to fresh cut mine. The cashier with the broken arm (so as not to be vague) looked and acted like work was the last place she wanted to be. The soda counter was dirty and the garbage was over running. This place better clean up their act or I promise they will not be opened much longer."

Today I left my house earlier just so I have time to wait in line for my latte. Of course the line was moving slow. I ordered my latte and resumed waiting. Finally, after 20 minutes or so I get my latte, pay and off I go to class. I typically like to wait for my drinks to cool down before I drink so I don't end up hurting myself. So about half hour later I begin sipping on my latte in class. And then all of sudden, some gooey mushy thing ends up between my lips. I freak out and spit it back into the cup as quietly as I can so I don't interrupt class. I thought maybe the coffee stopper melted a little and was in my drink but I couldn't see clearly what was in the drink through the mouth piece of the lid. So I left my drink under my seat until after class. After class, I opened the lid and to my horror I found a WASP floating in my drink. A wasp. How do they miss that?! I mean don't you see this giant thing in there? And it was floating so they should still see it after they poured my drink in! Absolutely disgusting. Never coming back and leaving Starbucks for good!"

Shouldn't you be more concerned with how you treat me? The cashier didn't greet me, didn't say 2 words to me except ""you wanted the frappe?"" The picture is my order...

It's important to note that the slices heated up well a day later... still fresh-tasting.They are a little pricey, but consistent in the quality of the food and the speed of delivery. The delivery guys are cool, so tip them well.My only criticism would be that they need to focus on improving the uniqueness and quality of sides, like mozzarella sticks.Keep up the good work! Molto bene.INSIDER INFO: Apparently it's not good to leave pizza out for a long time, even in the box. I used to do that. Stay healthy and  jam the box into the fridge!"

Went to pick it up after 35 minutes they just put my order in, so I asked the girl on the register how much longer will it take and instead of answering she put one of the cooks on the phone. This cockroach starts yelling at me that they have 100 orders and I need to wait, wouldn't tell me how much longer and instead just made me wait 15 more minutes.  I should have just left but I didn't, my mistake. If it wasn't for all the snow I would have never given them another chance. Calzones looked and tasted like white garbage juice. Dry and flavorless garlic knots. Cardboard pizza.

I actually ended empty the content and ate only the toasted bread which was actually ok! LolThey added few small home made donuts which actually were the great and really improved the experience of ordering deliver from knapp pizza. I may try them again in the future, but for sure not the hero. Which has a great potential since the hero itself is crispy and delicious, just the content isn't good enough."

And proceeded to yell at me and was playing games on the phone as if he wasn't there when i said something bout him he suddenly got back on the phone.. so clearly somethings not right with the person!!! They tell me not to order again! I didn't know that when you mess up a customers order the right thing to do is say never come back!! Here's a picture showing what they sent me and wanted me to enjoy!! I wouldn't want to come back to your establishment anyway after this! By the way your mozzarella sticks and gluten free pizza are disgusting as well!! Whoever doesn't believe me try it, you'll see!!!"

We got there with a large party of 9 people only to find out there was a new $120 price fix which they claimed was mandatory. We denied. The suit bottle boy then conversed with his higher-ups and returned to our table to inform us that we had 60 minutes to eat. It is important to note that the restaurant was completely empty. Aside from the scummy employees the food was incredibly average. Overall DO NOT GO HERE. Management, feel free to contact me to discuss further if need be."

There were four of us and we got seated in the outdoor patio with a lot of greenery outside, which we loved. As you can see from the photos we ordered a lot so I'll walk through it all.For drinks we had the baby Brasa martini (if you like lychee martinis this is a must) and a mezcal drink that was spicy and yummy. We started with the fish tacos, empanadas, tuna tartar, and mango salad. Each plate is relatively small and shareable. Only two tacos come per plate and they're tiny so make sure to get enough for each person. We had the pot roast, the founder, and the steak stir fry as our main dishes. The steak stir fry was my personal favorite with fries and peppers mixed with the steak for a yummy combination with the rice. The pot roast has exquisite creamy mashed potatoes so definitely another favorite.I docked one star Bc we were seated away from the fans and it's a very hot day so I felt a bit humid and warm at the end. Additionally, the tables are a bit small for 4 people so don't order everything at once as you need to keep switching out plates.Overall an excellent spot for drinks or a meal with great customer service and delicious food."

They have many interesting options - I tried a few spicy drinks that were amazing! The espresso martini was so good as well. Our bartender, Jordan, was very nice and made sure we were having a great time. We never felt rushed or anything - in fact, we were there for so long that we decided we needed some food. The tuna tostadas were delicious. I also really liked the calamari - crunchy and had great seasoning. Later, I had the steak with chimichurri and fries, very tasty.

It was good, even though I was hoping the calamari was fresh and not fried. I took off a star because our waitress was very rude.

There are two downsides / , which may be temporary but let's see.#1 - they are renovating the indoor space, so seating is limited to outdoors. While they did their best to keep the space heated etc., it's still NYC in the winter and this should be better communicated. Doubt I'll be back until the indoor space opens or it gets warmer.#2 - it's expensive! We did the Pulsd deal ($39 for 2 entrees and 4 drinks) which made it more in-line with expectations, but I can't imagine paying retail prices.As for food, the breakfast burrito and the steak & eggs are both solid.

Went to counter, was told bathroom was being cleaned. Great, I love a clean bathroom. But after waiting a few more minutes, gently knocked. No response except ""Cleaning!"" Waited again, knocked gently again. ""Cleaning."" Door opens. ""May I please use the bathroom?"" ""Cleaning,"" is all the cleaner would say. A young woman from behind the counter appears at my side to tell me that the cleaner is only trying to do her job. As if expressing that you need the restroom and are told ""Cleaning!"" is keeping a person from doing their job. What is the priority here? The counter woman, after I silently turned in key, explained to me how there'd be a sign next time when the bathroom is cleaned that says ""Out of Order."" I proposed that it might be a nice move to halt cleaning to let a customer use the bathroom. At that point counter woman posed a sophomoric theoretical, ""Would you expect to go first if there were other people on line before you?"" When I answered tartly, I was asked, ""Are you okay?"" in the most concerned manner possible. I was schooled by a social justice warrior all because I asked politely if I might use the bathroom at an inopportune moment for the cleaner."

Thankfully, I came across this place and saw that they had a selection of them. They had a deal where if you got 6 of them, you get one free. I got the the raspberry, dulce de leche, blueberry, lemon, salted caramel, matcha, and lavender (left to right, top to bottom in photo). They were interesting flavors and they taste okay (I would give a three out of five).  Regrettably, the service at the front was shoddy. When I asked for 6, the salesperson was going to put them in a paper bag for me. Speaking from one former patisserie/food service worker to another, you don't put macarons in a paper bag. You must put them in a box to prevent crushing them. The salesperson as reluctant to get me the plastic box and that's when the attitude came through.  They took out a box of the available macarons and when I saw that vanilla was unavailable from the box but in the fridge display, I inquired about them. The salesperson responded by saying that, ""Those are only for display and they've been there for a month so you can have them if you'd like."" They said this so confidently as if they didn't just tell me they got a health code violation.  Lastly, when their coworker asked what the order was, the salesperson in question remarked that I was looking for ""macaroons."" This was done in a manner that insinuated I was uncultured in referring to the desserts as ""macarons."" If you are a salesperson for a bakery, you should be informed that a macaron is a type of confectionery with French origins, whereas the macaroon is a type of biscuit with Italian origins.  I would give service a two out of five. The total would be a two star (I'm rounding down because of the poor taste in Madame X concert tour merch [yes, an ad hominem])."

Not only was this place open, but filled with people (mostly on laptops).After looking at all the pastries, settled on the peanut butter & jelly poptart ($3ish) and a medium latte ($4ish). Coffee/food came out in a couple minutes and headed to the couch towards the back. Seating is a bit worse for wear (comes with the territory), but comfy enough for a meal. Very excited for the fancy pop tart - took a bite and immediately regretted the decision. Outside tasted very chalky (couldn't pick up any hint of peanut butter), the inside ""jam"" tasted old, not fresh as it had looked from the display. Coffee is warm and tasted okay; not as strong as I had hoped it would be.For convenience sake, this place is good in the fact that it's open late and isn't too crowded.

I'm always surprised by how quickly I get my food. Yes, I'm here for the Happy Meals again. I felt a bit bad though; two people ordered before me, and I still got my food before they did. The people who hand off food are really kind. Even though it was really busy, she grabbed an assortment of toys for me to exchange for. That means four stars from me!Like I've been saying, this is one of the nicer McDonald's. It's really clean, and there's good seating. You can probably find a seat if you go before 12:30. Afterwards, it fills up pretty quickly. Also, I was here when a group of students came in, and they were joking around with each other, but yelling sort of obscene things at each other. One of the workers immediately told them off, saying they can't say those sorts of things in here... that's a good thing, isn't it?They also have an option to build your own burger, which looks interesting, and I didn't realize McDonald's offered that option. As one of the more modern/updated(?) McDonald's you can order your food from a kiosk, and fill your own drinks from what I still think is a really cool drink dispenser! I'm not sure whether the price of Happy Meals have been raised, but $5? I can usually get a Happy Meal for under $5 even in Manhattan... Did they raise it from $2.99 in the month I haven't eaten McDonald's? If you plan on getting a Happy Meal here, I would suggest getting the Mighty Kids Meal. It's so much more worth it; in the end I think it may be around 50 cents more? And you get like twice the fries (I have no idea how my friend ended up with two small fries- was it a mistake or does Mighty Kids Meal mean double the fries?). My friend took a soda instead of the apple juice, but there was no upcharge? We weren't sure if they really don't upcharge for a fountain drink, or if the cashier was new, because he looked like he was having trouble inputting her order. Yeah, I'm not sure how the Happy Meals work here."

Top 5 actually.It may be because I'm trying to cut down on sugary treats and with it being so close to home, it can be VERY dangerous. But that's a good thing for you all!  I first visited here back in 2017 on behalf of my nephew, who is thin enough to partake in constant donuts.  We've visited Moes, Peter Pan, and Dun-Well together, and while those are all very, very good, for me what's now Fat Doughnut (much better name than Brooklyn Doughnutry) feels like a great, down-home, no frills spot that has superior sweets. What's best about it is the variety. They usually have so many different flavors, and types, that the pick can be difficult.  But don't worry, you'll have to walk out with at least two tasty treats, and maybe even one will make it home.  The staff are also very nice, and patient. They make the experience that much better.  I look forward to returning to Fat Doughnut soon. Try to get there before 11am though, before they start selling out!"

Also had the egg salad sandwich on a baguette and it was interesting. It was the whitest & chunkiest egg salad I have ever had but it was good. I like a lot of black pepper on mine so I ended up adding that. It's served cut in half but I separated the halves because every time I  bit into it, the salad would slide out of the sandwich. It was easier to eat it as an open face. Just my preference as I'm very particular about getting messy when I eat. Yolks of the egg are soooo yellow! I thought they were bell peppers! I really liked the dill in the egg salad too. I've ordered here twice for delivery now and I will say that they are consistent but I have not found a wow factor as of yet.

I really enjoyed all the different fixings (brussels sprouts, cauliflower, mango salsa, pico de gallo, plantains, corn, and etc.) My top favorites were the cauliflower, mango salsa, and plantains. And of course, the most amazing coconut rice. Del Sur allows you to make your own plate/bowl similar to other fast-food restaurants, but they really focus on the quality and the flavors.

We really appreciated that they were open until 9 pm since since some people were coming from Jersey and we were arriving from work. I didn't get there until 6:30pm.The fruits for the beverages were imported from South America. The blackberry drink was so refreshing and terrific with the bowl. I've never had the guanábana or sour sop before! It tasted like drinking a combo of pineapple, plantain and banana taste and flavor. Very interesting. I was glad to try it.We shared the following:Arepa- this was so crunchy on the outside with such a cheesy inner filling. I'm used to arepas to be stuffed inside so this was more like a fried cheese disc added to the bowl.Shrimp plate with coconut rice and sweet plantains and mango. The shrimp was juicy and well flavored. I would love to try the coconut rice next time. Grass fed skirt steak with chimichurri sauce, quinoa and salad bowl with roasted brussel sprouts, sweet plantains, roasted corn and jalapenos. The roasted vegetables had a umami flavor and were sweet. The steak was a little dry but still flavorful. I enjoyed the sweetness of the plantains and the umami flavor of the roasted corn and brussel sprouts. The jalapenos were spicy and pickled. I would skip this next time. Fried chicken with roasted corn, roasted brussel sprouts, roasted cauliflower and sauteed mushrooms in a lettuce/quinoa bowl. The fried chicken was crunchy and juicy inside. The vegetables were a wonderful mix. It felt very healthy to eat. I would definitely return for a lunch or a fast casual dinner.

Not cheap and it wasn't enormous but it was delicious and filling, even though not large. I hope this place survives. It's in a terrible location for me.

Between the pizza, chicken or pepperoni rolls, stromboli, or even the beef patties, I have a hard time choosing what to get for lunch. The prices here are typical for Midtown Manhattan - your lunch will cost a pretty penny. For example, two specialty slices and a drink will run you approx $10. A chicken roll is around $8. Pricey, especially considering dollar pizza joints are near by, but you really get what you pay for. A few extra bucks for quality pizza is always worth it."

I was at Radio City Pizza this morning and noticed a flat board sign advertising their free coffee with any breakfast item. I went inside and was astounded to find prices that were similar and some cheaper than the many street coffee/egg sandwich carts outside. I had what could be considered their deluxe breakfast. For a measly $4.25 you get:* Home style potatoes* Choice of meat (bacon, ham or sausage)* 2 eggs, done any style* Buttered toast, choice of whole wheat or white* Small coffeeThis was a great deal because of the great portions. The potatoes took up half my plate. I was given two sausage patties and these were bigger than even the ones you would get at a McDonalds. The toast was made of 2 large pieces of white bread. I was very full after enjoying my breakfast. I wonder how they can offer such a cheap breakfast, since these guys are a brick and mortar restaurant. Other menu items include a bagel with butter for $1.25 and with cream cheese for $2. Just by looking, I can tell they source their bagels and baked goods from a good bakery. They also offer breakfast sandwiches and smaller platters.As for seating, Radio City Pizza has a loft-style seating area high above the counter, so it is nice and scenic looking out onto the street. I am interested in trying their pizza someday. However, I can solidly recommend breakfast at Radio City Pizza based on the great value!"

3338,KxFUde0zYhZXBeJKnwPzMg,5/2/2015,5 star rating,"Best pizza in New York as far as we have found. The WHITE PIE was delicious!!!!!!! Oh my gosh so amazing. The crust was thin and cooked so that it was slightly crispy. The mozzarella cheese was great, and the ricotta cheese on top was bombbbbb. One of the best pies we've had in New York. The place is small and there is a second story where you can grab a small table and eat your slice. We did the 2 slice combo with a drink for $5. We loved this pizza!"

I was happy to see a nice selection of speciality slices and only a few people in line around 11:15am on a weekday. I ended up getting a couple of plain cheese slices that hit the spot nicely. Good-sized slices, nice crisp crust and above average flavor. It was slightly greasier than I would have preferred, but for two slices and a drink under $7 this close to the action, it's hard to beat! I would certainly make a point to stop back if I need to grab a quick bite in the area again."

I ordered deliver for the carnitas nachos. The delivery was late and took a pretty long time. Ok these nachos are also humongous. It could feed at least 4 people honestly. It can with cheese, beans (I chose pinto beans) and then I also got carnitas, crema and guac (which are extra). Honestly after 2 bites I was done with them. The carnitas made them so greasy and just became unappetizing after a few bites. Maybe if I got the chicken or veggie it would have been better. The chips themselves were pretty good. Not sure if I can rave about these though."

The texture of the chicken literally made me sick to my stomach. Was it canned chicken? I don't know but I definitely do not recommend the chicken.I am giving them 3 stars for the steak tacos and the mango Jarrito. Although it was the same flavorless tortilla the steak wasn't as bad, and I enjoyed the guacamole and various sauces.$34 for 6 tacos and 1 Drink There are plenty tacos in the city.

I ordered 3 carnitas tacos at $4 each. The carnitas were cold. It was good, but it wasn't the best. They looked nice, they just tasted okay. Because i eat tacos so much (maybe once a week) good tacos i remember. These were just okay. Maybe i should've tried other flavors. All in all 3 stars. Not bad or good, just regular. Peep pics below"

I ordered nachos, a carne asada quesadilla and chicken, and steak tacos. The nachos were alright, but nothing special. They were just super cheesy. The tacos were dry, overstuffed, and incredibly bland. They actually ruined our appetites. The quesadilla was literally just stuffed with cheese and not even toasted properly. I had to go home and toast it on a pan to make it palatable. I can see myself enjoying this food if I was trashed  out of my mind, but not while I'm even slightly sober."

It was ok.  I got two tacos, the meat was ok, about average, but it was very limited what the tacos had - mostly a tiny bit of cheese and a little bit of sour cream, no frills.  Husband also got some food here, it was ok. Prices are very reasonable though, about $4 per taco.  It was close to the hotel and convenient."
3351,J6EsXebZbacSOoIjpQRocQ,5/26/2022,2 star rating,The best way to describe this place is disappointing. It portrays itself as a mom and pop Mexican restaurant but the food really is so disappointing. The portion for one was just small and my plate was so lazily put together. I ordered a carnitas plate and they just put a big piece of pork on top of my rice and beans. Highly recommend electric burrito down the street instead for a better experience.
3352,0wSOGZrj4ILpZSgE7SaYuw,10/30/2019,3 star rating,"Pizza in QueensMom & pop pizzerias exist all over NYC. For most New Yorkers, this pizzeria is just a couple of blocks away & it's been around for years. A generation ago, this pizzeria was run by Giuseppe & his paisanos, however, today it's run by Josè & his amigos. Yes people, there's been a cultural change w/our beloved NYC pizzerias. Each time I stepped into a local neighborhood pizza joint I was greeted by a Latino. It happened at Rosa's, Rizzo's, Joey's, and 69th Street Pizzeria...that's just in Queens. The only pizzeria that served up a worthy slice was Sunnyside Pizzeria. I'm all for cultures mixing together, but don't f**k w/the pizza or rather don't f**k it up. Here's some advice for this new generation of ""Hispalian"" pizzerias: not all pizza dough is created equal & just because the cheese melted on top of the crust doesn't mean the pizza is done. Take some time to experiment with the dough making process & the bake. I promise only good things will come of it. Indeed these Hispalian pizzerias will satisfy a late night run for a last minute game party, but these pizzerias in NO WAY represent the pizza NYC is famous for. If you're in search for a NY slice of pizza, may I dare suggest grabbing a slice in Hoboken, NJ?"

You will definitely get your moneys worth. I took a picture of the half pepperoni half mushroom Sicilian pie that I ordered (the dark shaded area on the top left is poor lighting in my kitchen, it's not the pizza) The pizza dough has that delicious fermented yeast taste that I love, it's not a bland dough. The marinara sauce tastes pure of tomatoes and homemade, it doesn't have that acid herb taste from a jar. The garlic knots are also decent. I always order them. I've definitely tried many pizza places around before but I always come back to this place."

So naturally my family and I contacted the pizzeria to ask if maybe the driver just forgot it at the establishment. Get this we were told it never was even in the oven ...lol We got our pizza after waiting some more so that was good I guess. Okay you're thinking maybe this was a one off experience and I'm just upset about this right now...nope this is a reoccurring thing with Joeys when ordering. 9/10 something will be missing.

It won't subtract from the yumminess of the pie but it just won't feel the same as eating a hot slice sitting on those orange colored benches.  I am happy they reopened and pray for continued success, but the passing of Mark (one of the owners) will always make it feel a little empty to me.  The pizza was on point that I ordered.  Make sure you ask for a garlic slice when you can, they make it just perfect...  The sauce and crust are the same as I remembered from pre pandemic times and Joey's will always be one of my go to places when I need something to make my stomach happy."

I have to say everything about this place is amazing. They have been consistent for all the years I have been coming here. Their BBQ chicken slice is amazing and it comes with a great amount of chicken. They have sesame seeds on all of their pizza crusts and that makes it amazing. If you are in Maspeth and want a great pizza shop stop by you will not be disappointed.
3361,0wSOGZrj4ILpZSgE7SaYuw,12/22/2015,5 star rating,I love this pizza! I used to work in the area and would get it on a weekly basis- so when I get a chance to head over and grab a few slices- I go! I love the staff here- Mark is an absolute gentleman and stand up guy! The place is family owned and they know how to make really good food and run a professional business. What makes their pizza different is the delicious sesame seed crust. So good! I also don't find their plain slices as greasy as most pizza places. My absolute favorite slice though is the bbq chicken! To die for haha that's exactly what I had this visit.  Get a slice of that- you'll thank me lol This place has been around for quite a while over in Maspeth I believe. Could be Middle Village lol I can't remember the cut off for the two neighborhoods. Anyway- go grab some slices from here if you're in the area! They are open til 1am too

We had the classic lasagna, the chicken parmigiana and the homemade pappardelle with mushrooms in a creamy truffle sauce. The portions were well sized and we all thoroughly enjoyed our meals (and cleaned our plates!) The pasta was a little too al dente in my opinion but that's very subjective and I still loved it! The tiramisu was some of the best I've ever tasted (a HUGE slice, very fluffy) and the cannolis were delicious. There was beautiful live music that started around 7pm. My only complaints were very minor ... my water glass wasn't refilled until I asked (our server was VERY busy) and the carafe of wine was priced incorrectly on the menu (it was correct on the blackboard). I wish I'd taken pictures but I was honestly too busy enjoying the food! This is a lovely dinner in the theater district, perfect for before a show!"

Not to have you befriending the stop light; but neither had me asking ""where's the booze?"". Almost ordered a second CrossFit shot too, and I am generally not a lover of shots.Location has a classy, upscale vibe. I almost want to say it's West Coast-y but I could be tremendously wrong on this. Still classy!The service was very good too. It was fast and friendly! As I was walking in a cute dog walked by, and everyone leaned out to have a look.

So might as well embrace it. It was tropical, sweet (but not too sweet), and just the right amount of booze for a pre-dinner cocktail.I also tried the New Doug, which was very good, more boozy, but all the same, very well balanced.Didn't have time to try the food, but their menu looked killer.

On a freezing Friday night we decided to stay local for our date night and finally made it to Spicy Shallot (& it did not disappoint), this restaurant is now in my top 10 favorites! The moment you arrive you notice the beautiful ambiance, would even make a great summer spot because of the great outdoor seating. Indoors is so cozy, with beautiful, fun neon signs, an awesome sushi bar, and of course a gorgeous beverage bar. We came right in time for Happy Hour (open-6pm) and were able to enjoy some cocktails for only $7! We started with a lychee sake mojito and a c major love (lychee and champagne) which were both incredible! They do not skimp on alcohol, we were feeling a bit buzzed just after one drink, and each sip was better than the next. For appetizers we decided on the Crab Rangoon (which I've been craving for awhile) and we shared a Queens roll (spicy tuna, shrimp topped with tuna, avocado, scallion, masago, spicy mayo, spicy sauce), both SO good. The Crab Rangoon comes with 6 pieces, each piece is so delicious and filled with cream cheese, combined with the shredded veggies and spicy/sweet chili sauce you cannot go wrong) and the Queens roll was probably the best sushi roll we've ever had, it's speciality for a reason!For entrees we both ordered noodle dishes, I ordered the chicken drunken noodles (spicy Basil noodles) and my Fiancé ordered the pork pad see eew noodles, both noodle dishes were super savory and full of flavor.We also ordered another round of cocktails, mine being a mango sake mojito and my fiancé ordered the blossom breeze (strawberry purée and champagne), these cocktails were also fantastic and overall we just had a 10/10 experience!(They also play great music, especially for a night out and we also loved that we were not rushed at all. The staff was phenomenal in making our experience great)Top 10 restaurant right here! Incredible!!! Thank you Spicy Shallot :)"

For $4, you get a regular mason jar, but for $7, you get a whole pitcher! I haven't seen any other restaurant serve Thai iced tea in a pitcher. You can share it with a friend or even 2!Elmhurst has amazing places to choose from for Thai food, but don't sleep on Spicy Shallot and their awesome Thai iced tea!"

I placed  a large catering order on a platform called EZcater 2 months prior for food from the spicy shallot. I had a few dropouts from the baby shower so was calling the Spicty SHallot to reduce the amount of food when we realized that they didn't have my order, with no fault of their own. EZcater hadn't sent them my order! I was able to place the ~$600 large order and they had it ready in less than an hour and personally delivered it to me. I am so grateful for their help yesterday. And finally, everything we got was DELICIOUS! The pad thai and drunken noodles had juicy noodles and delicious flavor. The green curry was a party favorite"

I do think that my mango mojito could have had a stronger mango flavor because I didn't really taste it!! I got the calamari appetizer, which we enjoyed because the crispy breading wasn't too thick it was perfectly fried & crispy & perfect ratio of breading to squid meat. My besties mom got the spider roll which she enjoyed. For my main meal, I got the pineapple fried rice with tofu which you can not go wrong with! my bestie got the fried onigri which they enjoyed & I did too- I liked the Kani salad, but there was more cheese than rice inside. Lastly, we decided it was going to be all of our birthdays so we got a cheesecake to share- both my guest said it was too sweet for them but I like sweet, so I enjoyed the cheesecake & I would have gotten another to take home to eat now while I write this review. We also adored the live jazz music, as that is my best friends mothers favorite genre of music! Thank you guys for the good night, good food, and good vibes! Keep yo the great work!"

I'm in town from San Francisco for work and have a list of restaurants in Brooklyn to visit while I'm here. Tonight, I was too exhausted to venture out, so I yelped sushi near my hotel and found Ki. Arrived when they opened and had no problem getting a table for 1 on a Thursday. Ordered the Omakase nigiri and spicy girl roll (pretty sure that's what it was called). The nigiri was absolutely fantastic. I try not to be a jerk about it, but I'm kind of a sushi snob and this sushi exceeded my expectations. 2 of my favorite nigiris are barracuda and uni, both of which were included in the Omakase and were delicious. Also, the Omakase was only $50 for 10 pierces of nigiri! I only have a couple nights left in NY and will go back for dinner at least one, if not both, nights. 2 small complaints...1) it is SO DARK inside that we all had our phone flashlights out in order to read the menu. I'm attaching a picture of my meal, but without the camera flash, I never would have known that this is what it looked likeAlso, the spicy roll was extremely fresh and flavorful, but I didn't taste any spiciness at all.

The lady who took my phone order was nice - she made sure I ordered from the correct location. I checked their website - they have two locations; Smith Street and Flatbush Street. This location was already fully occupied when I arrived - both indoor and outdoor. This place was probably the busiest business on Smith Street. I ordered the Sushi Omakase [$48] and Sushi & Sashimi Omakase [$72]. Menu says the fish are air shipped from Tokyo Tsukiji market - they are insanely good. You can tell how fresh the fish are by their color, texture and flavor. My favorite was the otoro or chutoro sushi - I wasn't sure which one I had. It had a nice balance of fat and gave you a buttery sensation in your mouth. Uni was alright - not the best I had but edible."

That make me feel like perfection is attainable. This is how I felt at Ki Sushi in Brooklyn. I started off with the seared scallops with mango sauce. The presentation was everything. It was served on a huge seashell and the taste was out of this world. Then was the crispy tuna rice, which was tuna over crunchy rice which had unbeatable freshness, flavor and texture. The 10 piece sushi omakase was really good. It featured 10 sushi pieces selected by the chef. The menu boasted that the fish is air-lifted from Japan so I had to try it. We had cuts of tuna, shrimp, scallop, seared salmon, eel, mackrel and sea urchin, to name a few. The freshness was legit and the presentation was so beautiful. All flavors meshed well together. I got notes of salty, citrusy, chewy, buttery goodness. Lastly, I tried the lime and ginger creme brûlée which tasted really good and was topped with candied ginger and lime peel. The restaurant's interior was dark and tables were candle lit, making this place perfect for a lowkey vibe or date. It's on the smaller side so not suitable for large parties. I enjoyed an intimate, delicious and fresh dinner here and will definitely come back again. #HighlyRecommend"

Everything was good but the collard greens were hands down my favorite and the best that I have had in a while from a restaurant.The beer was also amazing. I was curious and asked one of the owners, Kenny, what was the black  on the bottom of the cup for.  He showed me the beer being filled into the cup from the bottom up. 100% oxygen! No nitrogen. The flavor was optimal and watching the process was fun. Drinking the beer was even more fun. Would definitely come back.And if you don't want to cook for Thanksgiving they are also selling Thanksgiving dinners that feed about ten people for a very reasonable fee, under 200."

Outdoor seating with heaters. We walked in at a little after 12 and staff was  sans masks. Ate:Brisket sandwich Pork ribs1/2 chicken Collards Green beans with baconMac and cheeseThe brisket and ribs were truly outstanding. Super smoky and the brisket was soooo moist with that legendary char. I didn't  like the chicken at all. White meat that was a little dry and some odd breading on top- I would skip. The collards were spot on and the green beans with bacon was one of the most inventive sides I've ever eaten in bbq.Great spot overall and a fun burgeoning part of Da Bronx.

I even went in two times and ate there and it was great. But my order tonight was a waste of money!!! I will never again order from here or go here . I spent almost $84 for this!! The pics show the food I got that was not worth the price! A pulled pork burger with no side included cost about $16.80.... Just a of brisket order cost almost $20 with no sides!!! This is a rip off !!! And it's not fair that your app and your in house specials are different ! Just to serve meat with no sides for almost twenty dollars is a rip off!!! Than your sides are $6.90 each and they give you half  of what you get served if you sit in from your in house orders. So you charge more for delivery and give less... plus charge a crazy delivery fee !!! Never again! I rather go somewhere else!!!! So disappointing! I will never give this place my money ever again! I rather travel and get my bbq fix in the city.... It's sad that in the Bronx we can't ever get a decent place that serves the community, they just serve there pockets!!!!!!!!"

Now we ordered a lot of items from their menu. The food was somewhat cold and it was not very flavorful. I love ribs and to me bbq always equals bbq. The ribs were cold and did not have taste. We also had the brisket and I think that was better. For sides we had the Brussels sprouts which were good. We also ordered the sausage and it was really good. The cornbread was also very good. The macaroni and cheese was not very good, not very flavorful. The service was good, they gave us samples of the banana pudding. We got the banana pudding it was overly sweet but I could not stop eating it. I would say there are better bbq places but maybe it was an off day. I do know it is Covid and I might give them another chance maybe that day was an off day for them. Overall their hh is good and their lunch menu looks good too. So I would try items from that menu."

Loaded with pulled pork with a yummy smokehouse flavor. The ribs were the best I've had in a long time. Very tender, full of flavor and can be demolished dry (without bbq sauce). Cornbread was also yummy with hints of honey and coconut. The next time I'm in the area I know exactly where I'll be ordering from..... HUDSON SMOKEHOUSE!!!"

Cashier immediately and very curtly told me that I was not allowed to eat in the store.Waited another ten minutes for the rest of our food to be delivered. As ice cream was melting, I took another bite of the sandwich. Upon doing that, the security guard asked me to leave.Seems very odd that you're not allowed to eat the food you purchase at the milk bar.  Bottom line - quite expensive for mediocre desserts and rude customer service."

The desserts are bit expensive and overly sweet. Tried their strawberry shortcake which was too frosting and jam heavy, and didn't have any real good flavors. If you have a serious sweet tooth & like classic American desserts & birthday cake, you'll probably love Milk bar. But if you prefer European style lighter desserts, this place isn't for you."

While the homeless man sleeping in his puke on the corner of Christopher st could've delivered better penmanship, flavor factor was money as always. Can't complain."

I've only ever been to the West Village a handful of times and only opted to come here because of the proximity to the Holland Tunnel because I was coming in from Jersey City. This location is actually a lot bigger than the location in East Village that I usually go to! The cereal milk soft serve was amazing as usual and service was quick so no complaints here! I was literally driving around in circles trying to find this place. It was so frustrating that I actually ended up parking a couple of blocks away and just walked there. Definitely avoid driving here...or just avoid driving in Manhattan completely.

The cereal milk ice cream with corn flake topping is truly the show stopper here.its so simple and perfect and something I could eat until I was sick. It's incredible. There's an assortment of other goodies. My wife and I got a couple cookies but they were very expensive for what they were and their size, but i get it's the novelty tax too. I wanted to sample a few other things that caught my eye on the menu but didn't have the room in me. I wanted to check out the merchandise but half the place was blocked off with benches and trash cans to keep some homeless people from hanging out. I understand the homeless situation is a problem that businesses need to cope with but it's very troubling to see people picking out of trash cans inside the business and asking not to be kicked out into the cold and the young cashiers not knowing how to handle the situation. Kind of kills the mood of the entire experience but I understand that's a very subjective experience.The ice cream was truly delicious."

Coming into Milk Bar, there weren't many seats available, so be prepared to buy what you want and then skedaddle. All the snacks on the counter looked so tempting! We originally came here fo the birthday cake, but we also ended up leaving with some chocolate cake truffles we tried and the birthday cake truffles. The birthday cake was delicious upon first bite! Vanilla cake with birthday cake pieces and buttercream frosting - how can anything go wrong? Too bad only a few days later the cake and the cookie pieces dried up! I thought the cake at Magnolia Bakery was dry, but THIS. Literally. Cardboard. I could have used this cake as a weapon to bang against someone else's head. The sweet buttercream frosting was the only thing saving this monstrosity of a disaster that Milk Bar calls ""cake"". I have never had to toss out cake before, but unfortunately, not even my sweet tooth could take in more of this cake. The chocolate cake truffles were incredibly sweet, but as I kept eating more of it, the sugar would overpower the actual taste of chocolate. I could only have half of a truffle and then would have to put away the rest to eat another day. This is good in small portions, but to eat one or all the truffles at once wouldn't work for me. The birthday cake truffles were also incredibly sweet as well, although I would eat it and mostly just retract back to the memories of eating Milk Bar's birthday cake. With this, I mostly only have negative impressions of these truffles. I am thoroughly disappointed in Milk Bar. With its exponential growth and booming success, I had expected so much more from Milk Bar. Sad to say I will not be coming back."

The service was superb! I didn't know that the place was so huge with three floors. It was decorated so intrinsically. It felt like a museum inside of the huge room of the third floor. Regarding the food, perhaps the porterhouse could be better, but the mutton was pretty good. We started off with ordering the charred shisito peppers and thick cut smoked bacon which is hard to get wrong. For the main dishes, we got the the porterhouse for three. For side dishes got the sautéed field mushrooms which could've been seasoned better as something was missing. All in all gave it only four stars due to some of the food being just alright."

The lobster bisque was hearty and rich, great start to the meal. The portion for the mutton chop was massive! More than enough for 2 people to share. It was lightly seasoned, perfectly cooked, definitely one of the better mutton dishes I've had. The hash brown was very unique! It was lightly seasoned with salt and pepper, mashed on the inside completed with a crispy crust for the exterior. Overall I really enjoyed this meal, the steak dishes are definitely worth a try!"

While hubby had the mutton chop I opted for the New York sirloin since I don't eat lamb. We also got the Maryland Lump Crab cakes for appetizer. Not saying the food were bad per se, but we were not impressed at all. My steak was a bit dry and his said the chop was way too lean. Their family carrot cake dessert was pretty good tho."

The oysters were fairly small, taste wise they were fine but nothing bite worthy. The wedge salad we added tomatoes and bacon which was needed, without them the salad would feel a bit sad though too much dressing in my opinion. For drinks we then ordered a New York sour and a gimlet, both very good would order again. We also got two signature cocktails one with gin that was floral but not too floral - the name escapes me. And my partner got a tequila based cocktail also very good (name also escapes me). For dinner we got the porterhouse for 2 mashed potatoes and mutton chops.The porterhouse was very good cooked a perfect medium rare - would definitely order again with the velvety mashed potatoes.

Steak was prepared to my liking, medium, with the right amount of pink. Very tasty. Creamed mashed potatoes were also delicious. Great atmosphere, great service. Definitely a steak"

The service was superb! I didn't know that the place was so huge with three floors. It was decorated so intrinsically. It felt like a museum inside of the huge room of the third floor. Regarding the food, perhaps the porterhouse could be better, but the mutton was pretty good. We started off with ordering the charred shisito peppers and thick cut smoked bacon which is hard to get wrong. For the main dishes, we got the the porterhouse for three. For side dishes got the sautéed field mushrooms which could've been seasoned better as something was missing. All in all gave it only four stars due to some of the food being just alright."

I really enjoyed the interior of the restaurant, a lot of oak and velvet (makes you feel like you travelled back in time). We shared the mutton chop, lobster bisque and keens hash browns. The lobster bisque was hearty and rich, great start to the meal. The portion for the mutton chop was massive! More than enough for 2 people to share. It was lightly seasoned, perfectly cooked, definitely one of the better mutton dishes I've had. The hash brown was very unique! It was lightly seasoned with salt and pepper, mashed on the inside completed with a crispy crust for the exterior. Overall I really enjoyed this meal, the steak dishes are definitely worth a try!"

The food is very good. we ordered the chilled seafood appetizer and shared a porterhouse steak and got a side of cream spinach. And everything was great.

Service was absolutely great, however we were a bit let down on the food. Hubby has always wanted to try their mutton chop and we finally did, but were taken aback! While hubby had the mutton chop I opted for the New York sirloin since I don't eat lamb. We also got the Maryland Lump Crab cakes for appetizer. Not saying the food were bad per se, but we were not impressed at all. My steak was a bit dry and his said the chop was way too lean. Their family carrot cake dessert was pretty good tho."
3441,YNJlbYYUiK8_OIhaTwckXA,11/5/2022,4 star rating,"We came to keens to have that old school comfort food vibe. Not pictured was the oysters Rockefeller, wedge salad, and drinks. The oysters were fairly small, taste wise they were fine but nothing bite worthy. The wedge salad we added tomatoes and bacon which was needed, without them the salad would feel a bit sad though too much dressing in my opinion. For drinks we then ordered a New York sour and a gimlet, both very good would order again. We also got two signature cocktails one with gin that was floral but not too floral - the name escapes me. And my partner got a tequila based cocktail also very good (name also escapes me). For dinner we got the porterhouse for 2 mashed potatoes and mutton chops.The porterhouse was very good cooked a perfect medium rare - would definitely order again with the velvety mashed potatoes. Though the mutton chops are overrated - would probably not order again."
3442,IYR-jmboN66jRDPRKw0eqw,3/16/2022,4 star rating,"First I want to start by saying Nobu is great. My reason for 4 vs 5 stars has to do with the fact that for the price, I wasn't wowed. If it were less to dine there, it would be 5/5.My husband and I made our maiden voyage to Nobu on a Saturday evening. The ambiance is swank and posh.. definitely a place to be seen!We were promptly seated and was surprised by the shared long booths for smaller parties. Interesting choice to sit next to someone we don't know at such a pricey spot, but we went with it. The server greeted us warmly and explained the menu. After making our selections, we got our first course which was the jalapeño yellowfin. This was my favorite dish- such a tiny jalapeño and quite a kick! Next we had mushroom soup. I was surprised it was mixed gourmet mushrooms with broth and no miso. It was good but more smoky than I was expecting. The mushroom portions are generous!Next we had our sushi platter. Also delicious.. but not OMG best sushi ever delicious.. very fresh however! We decided we needed a bit more so we got the crispy rice. Delicious. I wish we had it as one of our first courses because I was getting pretty full!Last we tried the salted caramel brownie- very good, definitely more like a dense fudge than a brownie and really rich. Overall, it was great- but as I said earlier, I guess for the price I expected it to be next level. The service was 5/5 however. Definitely props to the servers and chefs!"
3443,IYR-jmboN66jRDPRKw0eqw,3/5/2022,4 star rating,"I'd planned to treat myself to Nobu several weeks ago. But on the day of, I decided that perhaps I was too underdressed. Finally made it yesterday feeling better about my wardrobe. That said, there really isn't a need to worry about dress code here. Could be that it was lunch, but there were people wearing sweatsuits and sweatpants here. Moving along to my dining experience...It was almost 2 PM when I walked in. I was asked if I wanted to sit at the bar, table downstairs or sushi bar upstairs. I opted for a table downstairs and I was able to sit wherever I pleased. I chose a table by the window somewhat close to the door. Warning: if you're there on a cold day, it's drafty. Server who was also manning the bar with his mask half on came and offered me water while I looked at the menu. I ordered the Classic Bento and a Sencha tea. I'm going to break down each item with time stamp for later:Sencha tea - nice grassy note as described. Came in a tiny pot about 8 oz worth of tea. It was a teabag and not loose tea leaves which was a bit disappointing since it wasn't extraordinarily different from complimentary tea at any sushi restaurant. For $9, at least offer refills! Miso soup (2:06 PM) - busser instructed to drink straight from the cup. It was good, but VERY saltyCold courses (2:25 PM):Sashimi salad - really good, but the dressing was VERY saltyAssorted Sushi and California roll - really fresh and top notch quality. No complaints.  Warm courses (2:46 PM):Rock Shrimp Tempura: nicely prepared with great flavorMiso Cod - absolutely deliciousVegetable Spicy Garlic - delicious I included the time stamp on when the courses were served because apparently, they pretty much try to end lunch by 3 PM, which is fine except if you  look at how long the wait in between courses were and that my warm courses were served at 2:46! The check was brought to me while I had more than 1/3 food left without my asking before 3:00. I found that to be extremely unacceptable and unprofessional at a renown restaurant like this. To sum up: the food quality was top notch, no question. Just the aforementioned over-saltiness of a couple of items. The portions were pretty good as well. There would be less stars if the food wasn't good. The server/bartender was not good. Between the half worn mask, several last calls for the kitchen during the meal, and bringing my check when my warm courses were served less than 15 mins ago. The bussers were professional, albeit inattentive. My water glass was empty through half the meal. That's just bad for a restaurant like this. I guess they hype is real for the food. But there's definitely room for improvement. Specifically for the service and overall experience."

Staff is fast on service and knowledgeable of their menu- can be pushy about the order or what you eat- but I hold my ground bc I know what I like. My fav menu items are the cold mushroom salad , warm mushroom salad, simple sushi rolls- toro scallion, spicy tuna, tuna avocado. The sashimis are great aswell - hamachi jalapeño, etc. Prices went up if you care about that- I still love zuma , bond st, and Tao arguably more for creativity of menu options/ vibe."

The Shishito Peppers are always a yummy first dish to snack on while you wait for the others. The Yellowtail Jalapeno is so yummy, light, and refreshing and also a great dish to share!"
3449,IYR-jmboN66jRDPRKw0eqw,1/11/2022,4 star rating,"Indulgence.  Great food, service and ambience but obviously not a value play.  However, it's a solid choice for a celebration or special occasion. Group dinner with a friend visiting from Florida.  Brutally cold night so I stepped in a little early.  Glad that they sat a partial group right away.  Many other places in the city insist on full parties but if the table is ready (in this case, with a reservation) then why not let me sit and start with a cocktail?Asked about omakase at a regular table, not the counter.  The server said they could arrange a family style meal for the table, which we agreed to.  Added on a bottle of sake and a round of cocktails (strong and tasty).  Food was a good mix of raw and cooked dishes, and then added on wagyu and sushi bites. It's hard to really drill down into the food.  The raw bites were tasty, good flavors and garnishes.  The seaweed taco and the ceviche tacos were the most interesting.  The only major miss was the uni with Chilean sea bass.  The cold uni was excessively fishy, but I would say it's not a lack of quality and instead some sensory distortion from the temperature difference.  Service was top notch, responsive, efficient and unobtrusive . Sake cups and kettle were refilled regularly. It's very well run, with a noticeable army of staff.  It's pricey but you'll get good food from a well-managed establishment."

Although everything was so good, the waygu tacos were my favorite. I also got a grapefruit martini, while my friend got the pina martini.

We ate outside due to the mandates but it's unfortunate because the outdoor heater wasn't that great and they were playing such good music inside (R&B and Soul). So we couldn't hear anything unless we went in to use the restroom. We ordered the calamari and the spring rolls as appetizers. The spring rolls had the right amount of crunch/flakiness. The calamari had good flavor and texture as well. For the main course, i just asked for a regular shrimp pad Thai. The menu had so many options it was hard to choose from which is a good problem to have as a pescatarian but because we were kind of pressed for time before the kitchen closed, I chose whatever came to mind.My friend had a rice dish. We both enjoyed our meals. I finished everything on my plate but the apps. My friend also ordered a tea which is presented really nicely with a candle underneath to keep it hot but the wind blew the candle out so that was pointless. They don't have honey but they offered simple syrup instead. The service was good. They were on top of the bussing and checking on us. The bathrooms were also nice. The look of the establishment itself was well designed (except for the outside). It wasn't that fun. Overall it was a great find-I'd go back when the weather is better."

There was outdoor dining with heating and social distancing was enforced. The staff was friendly and wore masks. Overall, I wasn't too impressed with this restaurant and found the food lacking. I ordered Fried Calamari and Toung Tong for appetizers and Pineapple Fried Rice and Chicken Pad Thai as entrées. Onto the food!I always get calamari whenever it's on the menu so naturally I decided to get it here as well. It was not very good. The serving size was decent for an appetizer. Bland and chewy, the calamari wasn't very well seasoned. The tempura was crunchy and had some seasoning but the squid was very bland and tasteless. The dipping sauce was a mix of sweet and tangy and was somewhat thick in terms of consistency. Overall, I would say the calamari was a 4/10. I've never had Toung Tong and decided to try it. It's a fried wonton with ground chicken, crab meat, shrimp, corn, green beans, and carrots and it comes with sweet plum dipping sauce. There were 5 pieces in a cute bowl. It was crunchy and the corn was very prominent. I felt like it was flavorful but could have been more flavorful. It seemed rather mild and dry as I expected a burst of juicy flavor. Overall, it was a 6/10. I love pineapple fried rice and it's one of my go-tos. While this pineapple fried rice was good, it wasn't amazing. I would say it was average in terms of taste. It was a decent portion and had a mix of chicken, shrimp, and squid. The chicken and shrimp were well cooked and the squid wasn't very chewy. There was a mild curry taste as the rice was infused with curry which went well with the pineapples, which were sweet and juicy. Overall, it was a standard pineapple fried rice that I would give a 6/10. Lastly is the pad thai, another favorite dish of mine.  Like the fried rice, the pad thai was standard and the taste was nothing special. The portion was generous and there was a good amount of chicken. The noodles were soft and a good blend of sweet and tangy, and it was flavorful. Overall, I would say a 6/10. This restaurant is one I probably would not go out of my way to visit. It's great if you're in the area and want to grab a bite but it's not where I would go if I want really great Thai food. That being said, it might be a great spot for someone who has a sensitive palette or wants to try Thai food with a more subtle taste. Happy eating!"

No one else around so was able to quickly get a table for two.Decided on the Massaman Chicken ($13) to go along with a Jack & Ginger Cocktail ($12). Drink comes out first - an interesting mix of jackfruit puree, vodka, and bitters. Would have liked it a bit stronger, but loved the jackfruit flavor. Food arrived shortly after, a medium-sized bowl of chunky chicken swimming in a sweetish curry. Great flavor in the curry and the chicken is cooked well without being chewy. Only complaint is that it could have used some more spice.Service here is fantastic (as we were the only ones there). Inside is even nicer, so hoping one day we could eat indoors."

We decided to go here and called to make a reservation the day of. There was no issue getting a table and when actually got there their was close to no one in the restaurant. This could have been because it was a Monday or because it was raining outside but regardless we felt like we had the entire place to ourselves. When it came time to order I had the Khao-soy which was so flavorful and filling. We also shared an order of the chicken curry puffs.

It can hold large parties as well, and they have boards that separate sections together. We ordered the:Fried Dumplings- These were realllyyy goood. It's kinda like a combination of boiled / fried. It's got a great crispy top, but it's not like hard or deep friend all around. It's still chewy and soft on the sides and the inside. Pork Tonkotsu Chasu Ramen- WOW. the pork literally MELTS in your mouth, the broth is creamy and rich, and the noodles are homemade. you can really tell that there's a lot of love in this bowl and it was giving ""lick the bowl clean!"" You could share this with someone as well, the portion size is huge. I'd recommend getting an appetizer if you have a bigger appetite! Side of Chicken Katsu- she was DELICIOUS. perfectly crispy and they give you a lot! it was great to dip in the ramen or eat by itself. Fried Red Bean Donuts- we were unsure if we should get dessert or not, but one of the lovely ladies (i feel like she's gotta be the owner or manager or something) -- she was so kind and told us that it was gonna be delicious... so we couldn't say no. it was great. traditional donut with lots of red bean. it also came with a sweet condensed milk dip.overall, i had a great time at this place. i know there are hundreds of ramen shops in the city, but please give this one a try! the service is lovely, food is delicious, and it's a hidden gem in the heart of a busy area. support your local businesses! x"

I was so pleased with their veggie option though! So flavorful, lots of tasty toppings, and super filling. We also shared the pan fried vegetable dumplings and the wasabi cucumber salad which was refreshing but definitely a strong wasabi taste if that isn't for you. My boyfriend loved his chicken katsu ramen, especially that the chicken comes on the side so it doesn't get so soggy. There was so much chicken that he even took some home with him.Highly recommend!"

It seems more like a Chinese run place with the standard noodle option being a starchy wheat noodle. The marbled pork rib ramen was quite a large portion -- tons of meat that's sooo soft and tender, with half a *perfectly* soft boiled egg, kale and corn. The soup was hearty and if you get it with the Japanese egg noodles, it really completes the dish. We ordered it again for take out this past weekend and even the take out version was pretty good!

The eggs looked bigger than I'm used to seeing and it had a chemical-like taste. Not what I'm used to. I also picked up an egg and it looked like it had a clear exterior..I touched it with my ringer and it kinda extended out like a string. I attached a photo of what I'm talking about. The food was decent but maybe don't buy the tobiko if you like it!"

Went for lunch, got the Teriyaki salmon lunch special ..other than the presentation there wasn't anything great about it . The California roll had imitation crab meat that I had to pick out .... The salmon was heavy in sauce but very bland with no seasoning on it ... The rice was coarser than am use to and  the vegetable  and dumplings was   Probably the part of the meal ."
3480,s1c1P7P6BpTvoSKw26VAkw,5/27/2021,5 star rating,Junko Sushi is an amazing addition to the area. It's beautiful and completely different than the norm. Everything was fresh and tasted great. Nice service too. Junko Sushi... Can't ask for more.

Friday & Saturday nights are packed, but the best part in that this place has 3 floors so you can  mingle on the ground floor with drinks, go to the second floor for some dancing/more space, and/or go all the way to the rooftop for some fresh air. Bella Union is low key, but a fun! Its also quite new so you'll be meeting a lot of people from the Murray Hill/Kips Bay area who had passed this place during construction and now go here often!"

Note that the chopped chicken salad is lunchtime only. Went back for dinner and had a chicken Caesar salad it was fantastic - as was my boyfriends Thai steak noodle salad (very similar to hillstone). Must try!

Really nice ambiance, it was a Thursday so not too crowded, they have a rooftop which they've enclosed for the winters and have heaters. Since we didn't go at a crowded time I didn't have any concern about covid because we were very spread out from other groups. Drinks are good! Didn't eat but will def try out the appetizers next time! Will for sure be back, a good place to grab a drink and catch up, watch a game, or have some fun with a group of friends!"
3487,pQuZDnefX038xurT1BhDXA,12/3/2021,5 star rating,Very cool and aesthetic spot to grab drinks. The atmosphere feels homely and cozy. You have three floors to choose where you'd like to hangout and drink. This includes the 3rd floor where half of it is indoors and half outdoors with a beautiful view of the Empire State Building.Overall it's a great place to grab drinks and hangout in an environment that feels fresh and fun.

3489,pQuZDnefX038xurT1BhDXA,4/22/2022,1 star rating,"Wanted to visit this place so many times after walking by it. Finally went in for lunch today. Bizarre experience. Ordered a fried chicken sandwich, side salad, fries, cup of soup. Soup was good. Salad, fine.  Fries, outstanding.  FRIED chicken sandwich...delivered was a grilled chicken sandwich with mozzarella, tomato, basil or something. We call our hostess-waitress over to let her know we got the wrong sandwich. She says ""that's how it comes"". I said it doesn't fit the description and not even fried. She says that's their fried chicken sandwich.  We're like, really?  She's insistent. Whatever, she's ridiculous, I have no patience for idiots...so we just half ate the thing because I'm HUNGRY. I DIDN'T want an Italian type meal. I wanted a fried chicken sandwich. So we asked her again...she still stood by her position!!  I was nice the entire time. It's difficult to find workers...I get it ..but she's totally lying. I told her to tell management to take it off the menu then. Shortly thereafter, server walks by with someone's order that included a FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICH. Seriously. Lol!  So...if your business is so desperate to blatantly lie that your people placed the wrong order...and don't say you're sorry for a mistake, and continue to stand by your position that that is the only chicken sandwich in your restaurant...well I just don't trust anything coming from your restaurant. Your people are liars...for truly dumb reasons. Just a bizarre experience that I've never had before. Who acts that way???  I paid the full bill for a sandwich I didn't want and got the heck out of there."

3491,pQuZDnefX038xurT1BhDXA,11/3/2021,5 star rating,"Same owners(including Steve Nash) as Gem Saloon down the street, and same great service/drinks/food/atmosphere.The Gem, as great of an establishment as it is, has always been more for the 20-25/26yo crowd and Bella Union provides the next step in Murray Hill evolution. An awesome spot that's a bit more laidback than Gem and has more of a 25-35yo type of crowd. Definitely way easier to get your drinks here so... when the Gem gets packed, make the 2 block trip to Bella Union to enjoy the rest of your night. Or just go right to Bella!"

Just come here and order everything, seriously. Pickled hot sauce is made of fresh onions and peppers and makes everything even better. Come hungry, you'll leave a happy person"

3502,SxKvgnkMMZdhBJcxxKQnww,8/31/2017,4 star rating,I really like this for a quick meal. I had the general tso chicken and it was delicious!! I definitely will be returning. The prices are really good too. Me and my hubby ate for a total of $13 I believe. The only thing I didn't like was the broccoli but that's not the main dish so I don't really care.

3504,SxKvgnkMMZdhBJcxxKQnww,6/14/2015,3 star rating,Who knew this place could be tasty?I have walked by here lots and looks like your average hole in the walk take out spot.This place is halal so no pork on menu.Looks can be deceiving.Cash only- always annoying Finally really tasty though pricey chicken wings 4 for $4.25 . Perfect size perfect cook . I have yet to find perfect Chinese chicken wings in NY.It's funny because they sell either half or whole chicken for $8.00.Egg roll - only cabbage inside but very nicely seasoned I actually did not miss the regular pork and would order again.Ordered General Tso's chicken dinner special Large amount of food. Not too much breading on chicken. Tasty spicy sauce but too much of it.Overall good take out Chinese in Jamaica.Will try again
3505,SxKvgnkMMZdhBJcxxKQnww,7/26/2014,2 star rating,"Ordered delivery from this place with sub par results. The order itself was a relatively small order and they estimated it would take about 20 minutes. Fine--An entire hour passed with no sign of the food. I then call the place up and they're like oh your food should be there shortly. Another 30 minutes passed at which point I called to cancel the food (might as well order pizza than starve). The lady then insisted that my food is on the way and that I should wait 5 more minutes. I'm not a very angry person so I let bygones be bygones and decided to just wait. The food then came another 20 minutes later. The restaurant itself is about a 8 minute walk from my residence so the almost 2 hours that it took for my food to get here is a little strange.The food itself is just alright. Nothing amazing but nothing terrible. If you are trying to order for delivery, however, I suggest you save yourself the frustration and find somewhere else."

3508,SxKvgnkMMZdhBJcxxKQnww,4/23/2017,4 star rating,Best halal Chinese food ive ever had. I got general tso chicken and it was amazing. Other than the chicken im not a big fan of the rice.

At first I thought she was telling me to give her a few more minutes to set up to which I said no problem!!! Then she came around the coffee bar and opened the door for me to walk back out and stand outside :-) for 1 whole minute - incredibly distasteful and rude!!!! See ya never

I asked why it was a problem while I drank my coffee and unprovoked hostility from the staff followed. What a terrible spirit and way to treat people. Ive lived in this community for years and taken my family and friends to this place for lunch and drinks many times, what an unnecessary and unfriendly atmosphere to create for people and what a waste of police time!

A man working here was incredibly unpleasant and unprofessional. He ignored me, was rude to me for no reason, and rolled his eyes when I asked a question. I tried to be nice, since I understand that everyone has bad days, but he yelled at me when I put one foot in the door (I didn't see the 'do not enter' sign because it was on a door that was open, and I had to go back to ask the other woman working there for sugar since he kept ignoring me). I won't be back. There are plenty of coffeeshops in the area, so I recommend skipping this one and bringing your business elsewhere."

The lady at the register then turned to the barista and announced quite loudly ""people aren't tipping today."" This made the guy feel incredibly awkward, since everyone around heard the passive aggressive comment as well. I understand that it sucks to not get tip, but is it really necessary to make such a comment? That's not a good look for the business unfortunately. Chin up, and learn to be more positive. Positivity can be contagious."

Barista/Cashier - took our orders, ""Americano"" - probably the easiest thing to make... and somehow managed to eff'ed it up majorly.  I'm not a coffee snob.  But I love coffee.  And what we got... was NOT in any way actual drinkable coffee.  Americano is supposed to be dark & rich... this version took a long ""water-bath"" and stayed in the tub.  Yes... it was so watered down, I seriously questioned if I accidentally took someone else's decaf?!?! Trying to salvage a too watered down coffee is like trying to get your ""permed curls"" to go straight.  Impossible. IDK... maybe an off day? Maybe the food is better than their coffee?  Whatever the reason may be... if you want to stay a boutique coffee place, serve up coffee that won't disappoint.  $3 Americano - fancy tap water more like.

The Bar/Host girl was so sweet and nice the food is regular finger food. the hookah was cool But music wise if you want to to hear something to sing to or snap your fingers, you have to ask the manager who isn't willing to change the house music at a certain time. After some suggestions to change the music he didn't change it the music until we decided we was paying the tab. Drinks was okay regular price ,"
3523,CCcJhFyfdITBtzzeFrZBVA,7/2/2016,2 star rating,"The only thing good about this place is the DJ (if you go on a day he is there)I visited this place last year for the first time a group of middle school friends had already been there and had invited us. We were changed a $20 which was already a no no to me. I ordered a round of shots (5 shots) and 1 drink henny and ginger ale. The bar tenders were extremely confused from the beginning so I was hesitant to leave my card with them but had no other choice. When the night was over and I happened to look at my bank account I noticed I was charged $180. I bought it to the bar tenders attention and she had no idea what had happened. Come to find out the hookah and drinks that were ordered before id even arrived were charged to my card. These items had already been paid for before I arrived !I asked to speak to a manager and he apologized for his un trained stuff and attempted to make a deal with me. At this point I was furious no deal should have been made I should be paying for what I ordered it was that simple. I took down all the information I could and recorded the manager stating that he was at fault but of course didn't know how to do a refund. The manager refused to give me any recipes and I had to dispute the charges with my card,REVISITED- This past Monday I decided to give Mazaar a second chance 5 of my girl friends and I went in to have a few drinks as we were in the neighborhood and the music seemed to be pretty good. We all ordered about 2-3 drinks the bill was $133 which included a weird fee that they charge which I assume is to make more money. The DJ is the only good thing about this place, a guy welcomed us and said he was the promoter for the night I'm not so sure what he was promoting as we were basically the only ones in there. Though this place has so much potential they really need a new staff and better ways to promote."

3525,CCcJhFyfdITBtzzeFrZBVA,3/19/2018,1 star rating,"Sound advice to people- don't go here.  Management is not good.  They have been on restaurant.com, Groupon and livingsocial and keep using the excuse that they don't honor their vouchers.  Then get off their programs.  Takes 2 seconds to give those companies a call and remove yourselves.   Management is horrible and was such pussies they won't even show their face to their customers.  The hookah was weak as well and the mojito was too sugary.  There are plenty of places in the LES and in the st marks that easily smokes (pun intended) this place.  Avoid this place like the plague.  On the one good side note.  The waitress was very friendly at least.  She is the only shining light in an otherwise deplorable place to go to.Avoid at all costs new yorkers."

It's also a hookah lounge if you're into that. Its pretty tiny so you cant sit too much because people hog the seats. Theres a cover so be prepared or girls can try to get in for free if its late enough. The only thing I suggest, get better plasticware or glassware. The cups are super cheap and therefore tiny."

Noticed that the server Rosie charged me for items that we did not order. I confronted her about the items that we did not order. She got upset and asked me if I wanted to view the cameras? I called her bluff. She tried to embarrass my friends and myself by reviewing the cameras with the bar manager (but trust means a lot to me I didn't care about the 50 dollars). After reviewing the cameras the bar manager agreed with me that the bill was incorrect. The bill was corrected and I still left a 18 percent tip. However if you do go there WATCH YOUR BILL! I can tell they do that a lot. Trust is always more important than A few dollars.

3531,CCcJhFyfdITBtzzeFrZBVA,5/31/2017,1 star rating,"Let's start off with the fact that NO ONE greeted us when we walked in. Came on a saturday night and it was almost empty except one other table and a pair at the bar. The bouncer or security checked our ID's and that was it. We had to find a random table and sat down ourselves. There were 2-3 girls at the bar working but no one came up to us and no one greeted us. After a good 10 minutes we went up to the security/bar to ASK for service and menus. She told us someone will be with us soon and shooed us away. Waited another good 10 minutes just to get menus. And about another 10 for the girl to come take our order.We purchased a Groupon for 4 people that included Two Quality Hookahs, Four Drinks, and Two Appetizers for Four. We showed it to her and she had NO clue. I printed the voucher out and showed her but she seemed confused so i pulled it out on my phone and she was still confused so she literally took my phone and was gone for another good 5 minutes to find out. Not comfortable with a stranger taking my phone out of site and she didn't even ask she just left with it.  Supposedly it includes:- Two hookahs (up to a $30 value each)- Four drinks (up to a $14 value each)- Two appetizers (up to a $7 value each)It clearly says hookah with a value up to $30 (still says that on Groupon right now) but when we asked, the girl said we could only choose from the $20 option (not even the $25 options that are still less than $30). False advertisement but we went along with it anyway. The coals were too hot and it made the Hookah way too harsh, and it took a while for us to flag someone down to get new coals (all he did was blow it off and re-position it). Also, it says 2 appetizers up to $7, but they only have ONE OPTION on the menu that is $7 which is just pita bread with a dip, so basically no options to choose from.All in all, shitty service, shitty hookah, it sounds like a steal to get a voucher from Groupon but even WITH it, not worth it at all. Did I also mention the shitty DJ and crappy music? Murder to your ears. Save your money and get good quality hookah elsewhere."

Tasted just like we had in Florence years ago.  Wasn't the cheapest little bakery but then again you get what you pay for.  We had 2 large lattes at $4 a piece and ordered 12 of the small almond biscotti.  Total price was $17.The blonde woman who assisted us couldn't have been any nicer.  She had a smile on her face from start to finish.  I was please to leave a tip in the jar as she truly deserved it.

There is not an Italian bakery right near me, but this is just a short bus ride away so I'll take it.They have EVERYTHING. And it's all so so good. I tried their mini napoleon pastry and their cannolis. Both were great. I got 4 items for $11.The atmosphere was great and staff was friendly. There were a bunch of older Italian people there when I walked in, so i knew it was the best place to go!I plan on coming back around the holidays to bring some deliciousness to gatherings."
3539,0vg2Z-HPwkyVVX613j2ysg,6/4/2019,5 star rating,"A classic Italian bakery that has been an Astoria gem forever. The coffee and baked goods will take you back to Italy. Hands down some of the best biscotti and Italian baked goods on this side of the Atlantic. The place also offers so much nostalgia with its decor, side walk chairs and all the generations of the neighborhood that frequent the establishment. It definitely feels like you're family when you go!"

Even though they were in the case prefilled (which is almost a sin), they were amazing and just as fresh as if they were filled in front of us. Their cuccidati and pignoli cookies were also amazing. This will be a go to!"
3541,0vg2Z-HPwkyVVX613j2ysg,6/5/2021,5 star rating,"Excellent sponge cake, light and airy. The cannoli cream filling was smooth and had the tastiest chocolate chips without too much sweetness that is frequently seen with this type of filling. The fresh whipped cream was the perfect topping and they finished with beautiful large strawberries. An overall winner for a cake, packed with flavor and not too sweet. A definite place to stop in Astoria."
3542,FlAK0QXHIMqW6koDhs7DXA,11/20/2021,5 star rating,"it's hard to write a review in a way when everything is perfect. We had the best experience here. A+ all around. Williamsburg needed more French bistros, and now we got a few! In the former FADA space (but FADA was kind of a mess, with mediocre service and so-so food, wasting their beautiful expansive space) this is just a winner all around. I am so glad it is here.Dark, romantic, pretty but understated, with ice cold martinis, a friendly staff, and really serious cooking. One of the best burgers I've had in a while. The Foie gras was also superb. Great steak. The desserts are delectable.Everyone is just so friendly. Service isn't just good, it's instinctual. I never got to go to Pates et Traditions, despite living here for 7 years, so it's nice to see these *extremely talented super professional * owners expand their vision to this luscious creation. I will be back, for sure! When something works so well, there's a certain magic to it: you don't know why you're so happy, you don't want to leave, you're appreciating every bite, you want to be friends with your server, it's all here. Reminded me a bit of of the East Village's dearly departed Flea Market, but not as scrappy, and with better cooking.Absolutely worth your time and money."

I am so excited she opened this beautiful new space.  We have been in twice since she opened. Food is delicious and service attentive.  I especially loved the salmon tartar and crab cakes appetizers.   My only wish is that crepes were brought back to the dinner menu.  The new menu is a bit more expensive so we only save going for special occasions now, unlike before we would go spontaneously on any night of the week for such an amazing and affordable dinner at Pates.  None the less the service and atmosphere is wonderful, just a little bit more fancy."

I sat outside in the back and enjoyed the foi gra, escargot, steak tartare , burrata and more . The ambiance was beautiful and made me feel like I flew to france . Every dish was tasty and just right. I ended with the creme brulee which was perfection.  And the bartender made me an espresso martini for national coffee day. The service was friendly and made me feel at home from the hostess to the busboy food runner waiter all attentive and helpful.  I can't wait to return with friends and share this amazing experience.  Best of luck"

3550,FlAK0QXHIMqW6koDhs7DXA,5/14/2022,1 star rating,"My wife and I ate at Bistro So last night around 7pm. I will start this review with the positives. The ambience was wonderful, the service was great and the fries were delicious. We shared the beef tartare topped with a raw quail egg, and she had the oysters by herself. Unfortunately, around 10pm she started feeling sick and we rushed home. We couldn't get home fast enough and she became violently ill from food poisoning in the car on the drive home. Once home, she spent several hours sick in the bathroom and even chose to sleep in the kitchen to be close by. We've both had food poisoning before and it was the worst I have ever seen. I called the restaurant this evening to inform the manager of what happened so they could look into their food safety, and was clear we weren't trying to gain anything from this situation, we just didn't want anyone else getting sick. The manager (a woman whose name I didn't get) was not at all concerned and was adamant that my wife did not get food poisoning from their restaurant, claiming that you don't see symptoms until a day after exposure, which is untrue (you can become ill after as little as 30 minutes of exposure) and assured me that their food is incredibly fresh and wouldn't even consider the possibility that she got sick from one of the three raw dishes she consumed. We weren't going to leave a negative review as long as the restaurant agreed to simply look into the situation but their lack of concern and accountability deemed it necessary."

It was 1am and I was exhausted so having her fix it would've taken way too long so j just sat there quietly and ate it, I wasn't impressed, actually, I was pissed. I ate less than half of my food and had the rest thrown out, even the fries were cold! The second time I was hesitant but again, nothing else was open so late so I decided to be safe and order what he ordered last time bc he liked it. A chicken, bacon and cheese wrap with lettuce and a ginger ale. This time the fries were nice and hot so I was happy, the wrap although very dry was also pretty decent. The only thing I didn't like was that instead of the server telling us there was no ginger ale, he decided it was okay to just mix coke and Sprite and serve that to us as ginger ale. That's so annoying, coke and Sprite mixed does not make ginger ale, I hate when servers do that! All in all, this spot is okay.

Outside seating with retractable awnings, layered dark brick, and lighting which creates a warm comfortable ambiance.  Everything about the Inside is wonderful eye candy for a visual person - spacious, high ceilings, interesting lighting and architectural details, fresh flowers.  Great for a date or dinner with friends. Service.  Attentive and friendly servers each time.  Food and drinks. Mezcal old fashioned was well made and every dish was fantastic:- Tuna tar tar. Big chunks of tuna, delicious. - Steak.  Tender, topped with mushrooms and onions, mashed potatoes and tasty spinach on the side: delicious!- Brussel sprouts with a  spicy kick- so good!- Calamari with a tasty sauce - Stuffed chicken special with mozzarella, mushrooms and a tasty gravy. Fantastic comfort food.- Pasta with bolognese. Sweet, tasty, amazing!Definitely recommend for dinner and drinks with a date, friends or family."

This has been one of my best dining experiences, (and first of the year!) First off the service was wonderful. Also, it is clear that the staff works hard to make sure customers have a safe and fine dining experience despite it being a pandemic. My friend and I ordered the mac and cheese appetizer and it was absolutely divine! We both ordered the chicken parmesan and linguine with marinara sauce and it took everything in me to keep from dancing in the middle of the street (probably would have been a good idea, it would have kept me warm in the bitter cold.)I can't wait to come back again, hopefully once it is safe for indoor dining to start up. The only issue we had (which was no fault of the establishment) was the cold. It is hard to enjoy a meal when you're freezing your butt off but that is what happens when you go out to eat in January during a pandemic. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a place that has a range of different types of food, all done well. Also, you have to get the hot apple cider, you'll regret it if you don't!"

First, there was a woman so drunk who came out of the restaurant , fell, hit her head, and had to be taken away by an ambulance. Next, I experienced my drink coming out with a piece of dirt or a dead bug (not quite sure on the rim) and will still charge for it. Also, whoever was running the desk, a man, he asked my partner for their pin out loud in front of everyone on the street. This is not acceptable behavior and we will not be coming back!"

The moment I walked in and ordered a drink the bartender was extremely rude asking nonsense questions. Not once, not twice, not three times, but multiple times in front of the people I just meet so I decided to leave (i come to enjoy myself and relax). Anyways, he comes outside trying to explain why he did what he did which I really didn't care at that point I was already disgusted with his demeanor (especially as a possible new customer). He also expressed his dissatisfaction with me claiming I should look him in the eyes when I ordered my drink (I guess I ordered it wrong and he wasn't happy with that =)). Long story short, he says some nonsense how he feels threatened by me and someone in his family is a cop.  Not sure what that was supposed to mean or what he thought but I explained to him that i'm over 40 years old, work for large corporate companies and that he's paranoid ( which he clearly seemed to be  from the moment I got into the place.  Terrible look). Now I never got to try the place out,  nor will I ever spend a dollar in there , but something is clearly wrong when you have a super paranoid bartender treating possible regular customer's this way (management problems?).  Do yourself a favor, there are tons of spots on the UES, pick one that  shows appreciation for possible regular customer (proper customer service and management). My opinion stay away from this place in the later hours"

3593,h0ulrkowIQipwT0K--LMaA,4/10/2023,5 star rating,"Wow! This place really lives up to the hype! A Eater YouTube video rec brought me here. And id been wanting to go for years but, you know, the pandemmy just crushed foodie dreams. The slice is less than $5. I know it sounds like a lot but for the hype and for the portion, I'd say it's a steal. I know of lesser places that charge $7 easily. It's the perfect end to the night after drinking and you getting the drunchies. You gotta get a New York slice after drinkies. It's the law... possibly. Ambiance seems to attract lots of similar age and up peeps. Prolly lotsa college-aged, grad students, and middle-agers I saw while on line. The line was a bit long and out the door. I think maybe around 20 ahead of us when we got on line. Honestly I was happy to wait. It's one of the pillars of nyc pizza society. Small price to pay for happiness. For a thin slice of pizza larger than the size of your face, I'd give it all the raves I can. The sauce to mozzarella ratio is chef's kiss. The counter person and the pizza makers constantly in motion, making pizza are amazing dudes. Very quick. Kinda hard to hear once you're inside. The bathroom is in the back and very cramped. There is seating now and is very very cramped but you can sit and grab a beer. But I think for the most part people just ordered and took their pizzas to go. I think there's a wait if you order a whole pie. But that's to be expected. Line still moved relatively fast for a place so busy. Definitely will be back."

The variety was lacking and service was okay - I had ordered quite a bit but the server had forgotten some stuff, so I decided to just go with whatever he had remembered. Their pepperoni pizza was good but I feel as it was comparable to Joe's. This place does have indoor seating as well as adequate outdoor seating and its interior is very vintage!"
3595,h0ulrkowIQipwT0K--LMaA,12/11/2022,3 star rating,"Pretty good NYC pizza to try, but it's not as good as the hype comparison to other top pizza spots (ie. Made in New York Pizza and prince street pizza). It had a nice thin crust, but the crust was quite flavorless compared to other spots.I read honey drizzle was a NYC and Scarr's offered it. I tried it, and I personally don't recommend it on the pizza. The sweetness overpowers the pizza that I lose any possibility to taste the pizza itself. Only the honey.... I'd rather recommend to keep the honey as a dip if I want my pizza with honey next time!  it wasn't a bad combo, but I wanted to enjoy the true pizza at its core!"

Taste started off decent but as I kept eating, the realization that there was nooo cheese on it made chewing the cardboard harder & more tedious.I came expecting a NY pizza experience and now I'm left with a sore jaw and a sucky taste of my last meal here. Not worth the $27 for 4 slices of pizza..... 3 slices, 1 square and 2 Everyone in the reviews saying, ""best pizza ever"" are y'all ok??? What pizza hurt you so badly that you think this is the best pizza?And y'all waited 45mins in line for this too? I waited zero mins and even I didn't think it was worth it.Overhyped.

3599,h0ulrkowIQipwT0K--LMaA,11/10/2022,3 star rating,"Decent pizza place near the Chinatown area perfect for the late night. There is no sign at the storefront when I went, but you can easily spot this place if you see a line out the door. They sell a variety of pizzas, from regular slices to squares, and you will never know what to order until you are at the front because what was available the moment you line up will very likely be completely different from what is available when it is your turn to order. I personally got a slice of the pepperoni pizza which is quite huge and filling. It was not too memorable of a slice as nothing really stood out, but what distinguishes themselves from the competition is their hot honey. Hot honey is not temperature hot, but spicy hot, so keep that in mind. It makes the pizza taste a bit unique, but the pizza itself was just alright and very definitely not worth the 30 minute line.The biggest, most annoying thing is the line as you won't know how long it is, regardless of how many people are in front of you. It took 30 minutes even though there were just 15 people in front of us because the wait time greatly depends on if there are people in a separate line order whole pizzas. Even worse, those who came after us (with only 3 people ahead) thought the line will be quick but it had taken them 20 minutes to order and even longer to get the food, and we know since we chilled in that area and ate our pizzas for that duration. Given this is NYC, this is super annoying as time is valuable and many people are on a time crunch. They need to work on efficiency on this so that people have an incentive to come back for reliable pizza"
3600,h0ulrkowIQipwT0K--LMaA,2/19/2023,5 star rating,"Good pizza. They only had plain cheese, pepperoni, and pepperoni jalapeño in a display, so I got worried but they were all good. I especially liked the slice with pepperoni and jalapeños because they put massive honey on top (optional).  It was something different There were lines of people by 12:50 PM on Saturday, so you must go early."

3609,WBPbYPBrha8jxeUuqreYpQ,12/12/2021,3 star rating,"First thing you have to know about Soho Diner is that they no longer consider themselves a ""diner"", they are now a restaurant. This was the storyline when my friends and I placed our orders one night. Long gone are the all day breakfasts and the new menu options and pricing suggest the term diner is a bit dated for this establishment. That being said, if you're looking for some damn good food and are in the neighborhood, SoHo Diner is a great option for anyone with a rumblin tummy.The rundown:- We started with the shrimp cocktail - typical, but made better because of the harissa cocktail sauce)- Crispy Cheese Curds w/ hot Honey - the waiter raved about this, but I felt it was a bit one note and bland despite the hot honey.. definitely one I would move on from in the future- SoHo Burger - best thing we ate and one of the better burgers I've had in some time... chopped pickles were a nice touch, but the ""special sauce"" was really just big mac sauce, which tends to be the flavor profile for this kind of sauce no matter where you eat these days - Rigatoni Bolognese - skip this, not worth the carbs... besides if you're looking for pasta, just go up the block to Sola Past Bar - Sauteed Mushroom side - damn good, and a great alternate to some of the fried sides on the menuAll in, I'll definitely go back to SoHo Diner, but will be smarter with my order selections"

I didn't feel like I had to wait very long for our food, but I felt sort of rushed to order when we got seated and rushed to leave. The waiter took my plate when there was a mound of fries left on it. ( I wasn't going to have it, but he didn't ask if I was finished and just took it off the table and brought us our check. ) Not a big deal, just a noteThe decor and atmosphere is also adorable-- looks like we stepped into a different decade. I had the burger medium rare and it was very juicy. Mimosa was expensive but strong :). Will definitely be back. P.S. @12/1230ish they stop serving breakfast and switch over to lunch items instead. Just an FYI.Also, $18 is probably the most I've ever paid for a mimosa lol"

Although they had so many yummy looking salads, I can truly and honestly never ever pass up shakshooka. I love it so much. If you do too, you'll love the shakshooka here at Bite. It was a good portion for lunch, left me full but not uncomfortably full. It had a tiny little salad on the side which I wish was a bit bigger. Nothing I will whine about because my dish was $9... how do you beat that?? It seems like this place is authentic fast casual Mediterranean foods (my friend got chicken schnitzel, they have pitas and shepard salads) and I am here for it. I would make sure you got what you paid for because we didn't realize until after we ate that we never got the fries we ordered. Not a big deal as it was $5 and when we told them they gave us a refund for the fries.Cannot wait to come back."

It all started at the 14th street location in 2005 when I had my very first panini. As I took bite after bite of that perfectly toasted bread giving way to melted mozzarella and prosciutto I wondered what witchcraft produced such a delectable treat. Until then, I thought sandwiches were made with white bread and bologna. Bite became the place I hung out at after school, and over the years I worked my way through the whole menu.One of my favorite orders is the sabih sandwich, which you can ask for toasted and extra spicy. They do something magical with their eggplant because it has me thinking about that eggplant for days. I also really love the Mallawach and Mediterranean salad. The portions are huge and you can get a filling meal for under $10. For Manhattan, that is just bananas. I was so excited when this location opened up near my office, and am happy to report the quality and hospitality remain high. The owner frequently stops by and will throw in a free cookie here and there, which is a big plus because their cookies are fantastic. By day it's a casual cafe featuring beautiful art from various artists. By night the space transforms into a cozy bistro and sometimes they even have live music. This place is like a chameleon in that way-- ideal for dates, solo lunches, and after school hangouts alike. My teenage self and my full fledged adult self both approve."

The menu has a huge variety of soups, salads, sandwiches, grilled cheeses plus combos to mix and match both. There's even shakshuka and spinach pie!Most items on the menu have a mediterranean influence (Israeli salads, chicken schnitzel, pita, feta grilled cheese, etc). All of the menu items sound so delicious that I had a tough time choosing!I went with a chicken schnitzel sandwich which came in a pita with Israeli salad and hummus. The flavor of the sandwich was absolutely delicious. The schnitzel was thin, crispy and perfectly golden fried. The sandwich also came with a massive portion of chicken. For $9 I think it's a really good value. Though the sandwich was tasty it wasn't executed as well as it could have been, so it was incredibly sloppy and hard to eat. There was also a very small portion of the salad. I ended up having to fork and knife it, so maybe next time I'd go with the platter. They also forgot to bring us out our order of fries which was a little annoying. That's the only reason I'm deducting a star -- otherwise I was very happy with the quality and flavor of my food. I was drooling over nearly every option of the menu, and I love how cute and cozy the space is. I'll certainly be back in for lunch."

I went ahead and ordered online, mainly because I hate waiting in lunch crowds. Glad I did! As soon as I walked in, it was packed to the max. I took it as a great sign but also had no idea where I was supposed to go to pick up my food. I wiggled my way to the bar and someone noticed me looking like a lost puppy and knew I was there for a pick up. As soon as I go the bag, I was shocked at the weight. Oh, this was a REAL sandwich. I had the grilled chicken panini and it was so yummy. super flavorful and dripping with goodness. I highly suggest you first prepare for this sandwich by having a stack of napkins in reach. It was a little messy, but it was totally worth it. They have found a new customer in me."

Why serve people coffee in the City That Never Sleeps with kindness and love, when you can put a damper on each and every paying customers' day while also stealing their card information!If you're in need of a place to rob you of your appetite from unhealthy conditions and credit-card account information stealing stress in your life, Joe takes the cake with an astounding 100% when it comes to worker dissatisfaction, customer dissatisfaction as well as overall lack of aesthetic. It's hilarious to drink coffee and try and be productive with cheap print-outs of 'books' sloppily lining the dusty walls of each store, when there are hundreds and thousands of cafes that pay respect to artists, coffee, and the true and irreplicable culture of New York City. If only the in-store workers who are burdened with literally 100 tasks at a time and are disgruntled from unfair pay would also care, but they are too busy stealing money and products from the storage rooms to actually care!I mean, why would you get a smile from your barista when you can be met with unnecessary growls since you walked in on them stealing cash from the til and then denying you exact change when you pay in larger bills?Ah Joe & The Juice, perhaps you succeed overseas, but even Dunkin' with its declining customer service still trumps you somehow.

3653,R9XDds0a1_jip3glIdlQsg,12/22/2017,5 star rating,Y'alls. Crazy if it fine Pizza you want then it's time to call THIS Pizza Hut.  The manager is a long time lover of the community and has told me he wants to #MAGA by making the best pizza money can buy.  If you ain't happy with this here fine Italian food then maybe you should just move on out of this hood.
3654,R9XDds0a1_jip3glIdlQsg,5/29/2019,1 star rating,don't order from the Pizza Hut on 11102 Sutphin Boulevard Jamaica Avenue ZIP code 11435. I ordered pizza from this location I ordered a big dinner box that was supposed to come with two pizzas wings and cheese sticks. My cheese sticks was missing.. my barbecue wings were basically Fried Chicken. I paid additional money for cheese sticks instead of breadsticks. upon receiving my order I realized that the cheese sticks were missing. I called back the location. they basically hung up on me and told me they won't order to my address again. They basically stole extra money from me because I paid for every item. Upon calling to file a complaint it was nearly impossible to get a representative on the line by my 10th attempt I finally got a person on the line. I told the representative that I was calling off my business line which was a recorded line. That representative then said she doesn't want to be recorded and hung up on me. I called back and finally got another person on the line that was willing to take my complaint number. I explained to her that the representative was very rude and they basically took my money and didn't give me my items. They told me that I can call corporate all I want nothing would happen their jobs are safe. Still I don't have all the items after paying nearly $40 in cash. the representative on the phone gave me a complaint number and tell her to take 3 to 4 business days I feel so ripped off because they now have my money and I don't have what I ordered. I'm beyond disgusted with the situation and I will not stop until I speak to someone that can rectify the situation. I'm also going to reach out to the Better Business Bureau and then he has an entity that is willing to hear me I have all three conversations on a recorded line. The way I was treated is beyond disgusting especially being a consumer. if you can avoid this location please avoid this location by any means. people work very hard for their money. To spend $40 on take out and to be treated with such disrespect is never acceptable. when you call corporate don't get discouraged because no one will probably pick up the phone right away. Keep trying. If this situation is not rectified I will definitely file a complaint with my credit card company. if they would have came back I would have gave them this whole order back and ask for a refund of my money. The manager's name was Muhammad. From now on I'm just going to order pizza from a old-fashioned Italian pizzeria. Forget this franchise stuff.
3655,R9XDds0a1_jip3glIdlQsg,11/1/2020,1 star rating,"DON""T EAT HERE!!!  The restaurant is dirty ( saw chicken wings, trash, grease on the floor)  They don't follow proper COV19 precautions...no masks worn by many customers or staff.  Trash is overflowing from a green can onto the ground outside of the front door of the restaurant.  Certainly rodents get into this at night. When you call their number it is usually busy. Then when you get through they put you on hold and then don't come back to you. It goes to an endless voicemail.  Went there recently to get a 3 topping pizza AS ON THE TV COMMERCIAL and the worker would not honor the TV advertisement saying that he couldn't since it was not in the computer.  I explained that I had to drive there because  I could not get through on the phone and he never apologized.  He then put his General Manager on the phone and he was WORTHLESS!   The GM would not honor the 3 Topping pizza and said he did not have to because they are a Franchise and not a corporate store.  He then hung up the phone on me when I asked for his name to make a formal complaint to corporate.  Never experienced such bad customer service from a Manager.  No wonder this store gives Pizza Hut a bad name.  After my complaint from corporate Pizza Hut, the GM called me at 9pm that night. I hung up the phone on him as soon as he tried to rub it in that Franchises don't have to listen to corporate.  Again, DON'T EAT HERE!"

To say I was frustrated is an understatement! When I finally got through on the 4th attempt, I was told there was an hour and a half wait! The food was delivered in an hour and 15 minutes ..cold and unappetizing. Do NOT order from this location that charges a $4 delivery fee for the privelage of being late and cold!"

I called to place an order, before I could even speak the girl on the other end was very rude. She lacked knowledge on the details of the orders and was carrying on other conversation with employees while on the phone with me. I became so furious that I told her to cancel my order and she slammed down the phone on me. Being so hot headed at the moment I didn't want anyone else going through what I did;  having bad customer service which would ruin such a good food chain. So I emailed pizza hut and a spokes person reached out to me. Let's just say that she doesn't work here no more because I personally went in and spoke to the manager."

3668,hGksyTiHBBdrhbiVjXzWVw,4/4/2022,1 star rating,"This place was extremely rude. I'm staying at the hotel next door, the hotel room service has printed on their menu that we can order until 11 pm (attaching a picture for reference). I called the number to order at 10 pm, and I was told the kitchen was closed. Of course I was super confused, especially after a long day of traveling and being so tired and hungry. I expressed my confusion, letting them know it specifically says I can order until 11, and the person on the phone at first wasn't rude at all, but they went and got someone else on the phone. This second person was incredibly rude. He started off not too terribly, telling me they closed earlier because of the pandemic, which is understandable, but I did reply that it would be helpful if they updated the menus so that hotel guests aren't given misinformation (nevermind that everything else in NYC is back to normal hours so it's weird they're blaming this on the pandemic when every other restaurant seems to be back in full swing + they've had two years to update the info they give to hotel guests, but I digress). The man on the phone then said to me in an angry tone ""the kitchen is closed, what do you want me to do?!"" Well I'd like you to be polite and not speak to me in a condescending manner when I'm just confused and asking questions. I responded that it was inappropriate to yell at me rudely, and he literally hung up the phone. Unbelievably bad service.As for the food, I've eaten here in the past, the food is average and overpriced. The price would be fine if the food was excellent, but it's far from excellent. I actually was disappointed when I realized this was the restaurant providing the hotel room service, but I was so hungry after traveling I wanted the easiest thing. You might as well go to Olive Garden for how sub par their food was the last time I had it. Won't be returning, I don't need Olive Garden food at inflated prices with an incredibly rude man working there who treats people like garbage. Also the place always looks empty and sad, bad vibes."

But service was really disappointing - waiters reached over the table and guests to pick up plates, the waiter kept interrupting and rushing us to order, presented menus as if he was disgusted to serve us. I, a White woman, was there for a business meeting with my Black colleague meeting with a Black business client. Even to me it was clear that the waiter was being racist in his behavior. I think their manager finally noticed and had him replaced but the damage had been done. It was a disturbing and disgusting experience. We were the only diners at the restaurant."

It doesn't matter where the bakery is in the South Bronx, warm fresh bread and strong sweet coffee are standard. I spent $11 for 2 salami & cheese pressed sandwiches, 2 buttered rolls, and 4 coffees.  Their tres leches cake is also solid....you get a hulk of a slice, it's moist (but not soaked like traditional tres leches), and it's layered in custard cream."

I chose to frequent this establishment because I work in the area and there are very limited options as far as food is concerned. Today, after waiting almost ten minutes to even be acknowledged (There was only one other customer at the time and two workers, only one of them was busy) one of the workers passes me and walks to her purse and returns a few text messages on her cell phone.  When I asked her if I could get some assistance she gave me the back of her hand. I then waited for two more minutes as she proceeded to walk past me for the fourth time. Again, I ask for some assistance. She then begins to degrade me in Spanish not realizing that my friend speaks Spanish. My friend then asks her why we weren't being assisted and she tells her that we weren't in the ""line"" (there were NO other customers). This is not the first, second, third or fourth time that i have received this level of service. On another occasion, I purchased a slice of cheesecake from this bakery only to discover mold in the middle of the slice. When I brought it back they were disgruntled and very reluctant to refund me for the slice. I will not be back to this location and my company will no longer be placing large orders through them as well. #DISGUSTED"

Spoke with a young man behind the counter briefly about possibly ordering a cake. He was very helpful and had many suggestions for me to make it the best possible. Five stars all the way.
3689,gjIctg7P18f6UocGVW2IMQ,5/9/2018,5 star rating,Best Tres Leches cake anywhere! All our birthday cakes are bought here. Whenever we have out-of-town guests they insist we get them a cake form here before they leave.

3691,gjIctg7P18f6UocGVW2IMQ,7/20/2016,5 star rating,"Simple and good! I always encounter a line of people waiting to order, which speaks to its popularity. A friend from Longwood recommended I give Pitusa a try, and I've been coming back ever since. I usually order a Cuban sandwich, dark coffee and tembleque de coco. Sadly, in NYC, quality neighborhood spots like this are becoming fewer and further between. Long live Pitusa."

They have various flavors and you can also custom order."

Its always correct and 90% of the time when particular staff is present, they know my name greet me and wish me a good day. Only a few staff members across the shifts (Its common for me to get a 2nd cup in the afternoon when necessary) are personable.  The prep area with the sugar, napkins etc is usually well stocked and cleaned often. Very busy location."
3694,iL9U6DG4ZdPrnMhXeSPIzA,5/19/2018,2 star rating,"This Starbucks is one of those I rather go further to the next closest location than this one or even to Dunkin donuts just to avoid this location. Depends on how busy they are, they rush your drink. I ordered a common mocha frappuccino, and it tasted nothing like mocha. I thought maybe I was given the wrong drink. I asked a worker and she said that it was my drink and quickly brushed me aside. I refused to refer to them as barista when you can't even make a mocha frappuccino. Also the service wasn't good. They were super SLOW and not friendly. Honestly not mean but with attitude and detachment. Like it's the customer's fault they have to do their job and can't lounge around. Please hire new staff! I'm giving two stars because this location is nice and does have ample space. I still don't plan to return any time soon but if I ever do I hope they changed their attitude."
3695,iL9U6DG4ZdPrnMhXeSPIzA,10/29/2014,5 star rating,"I generally avoid reviewing Starbucks despite being a patron for years... but will now do so after having visited every single one of their coffee shops in the area.As with most locations, the ambiance is distinctly Starbucks, from the music, chairs, tables, refrigerated foods/drinks and amenities counter.The only thing that I'd often grieve about is how few tables there are as their always taken up, some by people who hoard them for hours on end. Don't people work?The one thing that sets this apart is the vibe the baristas invest into their craft. Great customer service from beginning to end and that comes down from store management. They never appear overwhelmed despite having lines and they work through queues seemingly effortlessly.Since this location is further away from the 86th Street Business Improvement District, their volume may not be as insane, so there is a chance for the staff to recognize you, and be able to figure out what your go-to drink usually is... so if you happen upon Bay Ridge, and Starbucks is one of your destinations, this is the one you should go to. 4.6/5.0"
3696,iL9U6DG4ZdPrnMhXeSPIzA,1/1/2020,3 star rating,Month of January is suppose to be free coffee if you bought the Starbucks refill cup. Well today is January 1 and I'm trying to get my cup of coffee and the Barista has no idea why it would be free and she insists i owe her $3.21. I tell her there is a code on the side and she insists we only get a discount by bringing in our own cup.  Get a manager.  And manager has a problem with the order.  I show then the side of the cup with the instructions.l and code.   Still had a problem.   Well I did get my cup of coffee and I guess I'm caffeine juiced to write this rant. Enjoy.

I'm not usually one to complain about waiting on line for good food, but this took way too long. The coffee is what you would normally expect from such an establishment, but they can use a few more servers to help out in the back. When I did actually get to the front of the line, they were nice so that's why I rated it a 3."

3699,iL9U6DG4ZdPrnMhXeSPIzA,3/9/2016,4 star rating,Small location that looks like it gets very busy. Stopped in for a iced Lemongrass Green Tea which they did not have any prepared. So I had to settle for iced green tea with scoop of matcha.I really love the lemongrass cause it has spearmint and is very refreshing. But the green tea was suffice wasnt top notch but alright.Thats one of the things I love about Starbucks you can get matcha added at a very reasonable price. ---- FYI Matcha is a super food which too me is super fantastic!!

I ordered an iced green tea lemonade and the barista added water to my drink, which made it taste watered down. I used to work for Starbucks so I know a GTL does not get any added water, unless the recipe has changed since then."

Dessert at the end of dessert is also nice considering that they're small bites uniquely created for those who have that sweet tooth.Both caviar (toast and in cocktail) delicious. I absolutely understand why they were starred on TV for this. Something so little with so much flavor! Ceviche was flavorful and the fish melted in your mouthTuna ribbons were a great start, because this was refreshing and savory! Had a very familiar taste to it. Hearts of palm was also familiar but so uniquely I liked the citrus notes it had. Made the next few dishes bearable, since it cleaned your palate King crab wontons were great, the sesame oil in this brought out so much flavor. Would love to order these again!! Steamed sea bass with pumpkin was unusual but the sea bass was cooked perfectly. I would never think to include pumpkin in this particular dish, but it was not bad. The Maine lobster was perfectly cooked. A super tender and delicate dish. It was refreshing and not heavy at all.Foie gras was fatty and super rich. So it was perfect after the lobster. The squabble and the venison were probably my least favorite because of the gaminess of the two. I would prefer squabble over the venison. Was a bit disappointed with these two honestly. The caramelized pear and chocolate desserts were both so unique. I prefer the chocolate and my friend preferred the pear. Both visually appealing and unique.Overall our server made our experience very special. He was very attentive, made beautiful conversation, we shared laughs and delicious food. I definitely recommend eating here for a night of celebration or to dine here in general."

I ordered 2 egg whites with turkey bacon and thought it was cooked well. My sandwich wasn't filled with butter and grease either which a lot of places do. Everything tasted fresh. I didn't try their coffee - next time maybe. I think they are a little pricey (similar prices to Dyker Park Bagels) but they make good sandwiches and the staff is nice. I think they also serve wrap sandwiches and salads."

Their sandwich also came wrapped the same exact sandwich wrapping paper that 'wichcraft nyc uses, meaning 'wichcraft nyc's logo was on it. This may be copy infringement, or they may have bought our sandwich from 'wichcraft and pretended it to be theirs, or they have reused the sandwich wrapping paper from a sandwich they bought from there.

Although we are no longer together, the memories of the food here live on and I can tell you I have never had a Bolognese anywhere else in New York. Seafood wasn't my thing at the time and i can say that the vongole was amazing and as I mentioned earlier, the bolognese really hit home and knocked my socks off.

It most definitely caters to the 50+ crowd with their children and grandchildren. My boyfriend and I came here this past weekend after watching a movie at the nearby AMC theater. We were definitely the youngest people in the restaurant as per usual and were treated as such like at most restaurants I go to.What I did like about Il Violino was that we were seated right away and in the atrium overlooking Columbus Avenue. Perfect for people, or puppy watching!The bread service was nothing to write home about. We were each given two slices of bread, which were fairly large but lacked any real texture. I'd say the bread was a step above Wonder Bread. A nice crusty rustic bread to dip into the olive oil would have been more pleasing. The real highlight of the dinner though was my lasagna entree.Calamari Fritti [$16]: I thought the fried calamari was a little bland and not crispy enough. It's like the calamari was pulled out of the fryer a minute or so too soon and someone forgot to sprinkle the salt on top. The marinara sauce it came with was fine, but it didn't add anything to overall flavor of the fried calamari. Lasagna alla Bolognese [$23]: Is $23 a little expensive for lasagna? Yes, it is. Was the lasagna the best I've ever had? Yes, it was. The first bite was a perfect piece of bolognese ragu. I can't tell you why it was perfect, it just was. The lasagna itself was smothered with cheese, the edges of the pasta were crispy and delicious. I'm still dreaming about the lasagna. Tartufo [$11]: Ugh. They tried to fancy up the tartufo by coating it with cocoa powder. Any old school Italian place in Brooklyn coats the tartufo (usually filled with vanilla ice cream) with a hard chocolate shell. This is the only way it should be done.I had a glass of the Riesling [$12] which was fine, I like Riesling. My boyfriend had the Linguine con Cozze e Vongole [$27] which had clams and mussels in it. He said they were fishy. I could attest to this as I could smell it across the table. The bill came out to close to $120, not including tip. I'd come back just for the lasagna and skip everything else."

I got coffee with latkes, challah bread, knishes (?), and gefilte fish, and I was absolutely blown away. Firstly, I was very glad that the coffee never stopped coming, and it was fresh and strong. The challah bread was absolutely amazing. It was light and fluffy and so warm to bite into. The lockers were crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside and oh so flavorful. I really loved the cheese desserts that were beautifully layered and gently sweet. This was my first time trying to gefilte fish, and I rather enjoyed it. The horseradish really elevated the taste of the fish loaves."

At around 1:30pm there will still about a 30 min wait on Saturday. This is a classic NY deli. The folks who were here have a typical NY exterior but are actually quite warm and helpful. I got the sturgeon and Nova Scotia salmon bagel, open faced with everything bagel and everything on it (tomato, capers, onion). I joked that I never paid $30 for a bagel sandwich but when I got into it I did not regret it. The flavor and texture combo was the most refreshing thing I had all trip. My friend loved the lox scramble and I agree that it was delicious- the eggs were cooked my favorite way (pan fried, no additions) and it was just salty enough. I'll definitely prioritize this next time I come back! Oh and make sure you bring cash since there is a fee for card."

The potato latkes were not like anything we had had before and we loved them! The smoked fish plate was enjoyable. The blintzes were just okay and we could have done without them. To our disappointment, they didn't have any garlic bialys and we were told that the factory hadn't been sending them those bialys for some time. Their regular bialys are just okay. We are still on the search for NYC's best bialys. Overall, we enjoyed our meal and would be back just for the Potato Latkes."

The waitress yelled after us as we ran out ""that's not enough!!"" and my friend had to go back in to pay the full bill which was a shocking $65 fee...I cannot to this day believe that that was the actual price or that the diner wouldn't at least cut us some slack since we couldn't even properly eat.Overall, pretty wild experience and I don't imagine us going back anytime soon.

The manager approached to speak to me and agreed the larger booth was ok. I said no thanks and that I would use the bathroom and depart as I didn't trust the environment anymore. On my way out, I told the aforementioned host that it was the service industry and that he'd do well to learn to be of service. I also called him a cornball.

IDK. The late night diner appeal is completely stripped the minute you take a bite of whatever your previously excited self decided to order to satisfy whatever taco bell wouldn't have. Which menu items did we order and for which we so wrongfully expected to be worth the wait and money? FIRSTLY the waffle sundae -- holy crap this was the worst thing ever. There is no doubt in my mind that someone replaced the sugar with salt because it was just flour and salt in this thing. I skipped the entire waffle and just ate the ice cream.

Now it's swimming in a tahini based edamame topping and the avocado is essentially absent. They should change the name of the dish to edamame toast. I won't be ordering it again. I still love their oat milk matcha latte and may come back for another breakfast dish.

The orange juice definitely wasn't fresh and the taste was watered down from the amount of ice.Our orange juice was delivered to the wrong table as were our entrees which honestly leaves a bad taste in my mouth especially considering they sent the table next to us a free banana bread for the ""wait for the food"".

The açaí bowl was full of flavor and it was just the right amount to satisfy two hungry men. The avocado toast was garnished with three red onions but not enough avocado.The two complimentary espressos since we live in the same building were kind of bitter. The bill was $48. I will give them another try once they settled. Best of luck."

3787,D8TXbeZE0Mu2W3klMr-NMg,6/11/2022,1 star rating,"This had to have been the worst sushi I have ever had in my life, and I am not exaggerating. First of all, the service was beyond terrible. We sat and waited for our food for an HOUR while other patrons walked in, got seated, and got their food before us. Second of all, the actual food was terrible. I don't know how difficult it is to make sushi, but I feel like they had to try and make it that bad. If I could rate this place a 0/5 I would. Do not go."

I was dumbfounded and confused as they relentlessly inspected my vaccine ID. She inspected the ID's longer than a pilots passport before flying the president. Eventually, after standing there like a frog on a log; we left. One day I'll try the food, but for now I'm next door getting dumplings."

This is the second time in a month that I visited this restaurant during their open hours and they are closed... if you guys do not open anymore, be responsible to your customers and update ur operation status!"
3790,D8TXbeZE0Mu2W3klMr-NMg,9/19/2021,5 star rating,It was a rainy night and this was my saving grace. Great service and awesome food! I took the bust from East Harlem  and walked over cause they didn't deliver in our area but it was worth the travel
3791,D8TXbeZE0Mu2W3klMr-NMg,5/13/2022,4 star rating,really yummy gyudon. their sushi/sashimi options are nice on the side but aren't the best by themselves. still a great place to visit
3792,D8TXbeZE0Mu2W3klMr-NMg,9/21/2018,4 star rating,"It's my favorite unagi don in the city. I like how fresh and soft the fish is and how good the sauce is. The unagi don here is served in a large pot that is big enough for two people. The restaurant is usually full of Columbia students, so be sure to come around opening (5:30 every night). It is possible to make reservations, but only via phone. Finally the restaurant is next to the 1 train, so very convenient. The reason why I take 1 star off: the service is pretty slow and the price of unagi don has hiked up 50% in the last few years."
3793,D8TXbeZE0Mu2W3klMr-NMg,9/23/2019,3 star rating,"The place is close to the university and definitely worth a try. You get a good vibe at the bar and some traditional food.We got the shiso yam, teriyaki eggplant, and unagi set. I'd highly recommend the shiso yam at any time of the year, very refreshing to kick off the meal. It's also good alongside grilled or teriyaki dishes to balance the flavor. The shiso paste on the yam was chill and be sure to mix the soy sauce and wasabi with it. The eggplant was good but nothing to write home about, nothing bad about it, but simply not worth recommending (the sauce was too sweet and rich).The highlight of our meal was the unagi set. It comes in a clay pot with fish broth and scallion on the side in case you like ochazuke. The broth was made of kezuribushi and maybe kombu. We thought the ochazuke was great, definitely a plus. But the unagi rice itself was mediocre. Our waiter mixed the rice, eel, and seaweed altogether, which I consider it is an unnecessary step (the reason is that you can't really taste the eel since everything was minced together.)One thing I noticed was our waitress had absolutely no smile, a b-face. She made no expression whatsoever during our time there. With that said, the Japanese manager (looks like it) was nice and friendly. The value was just ok, about reasonably priced.food 3.5/5ambiance 4/5service 3/5value 3.5/5"
3794,D8TXbeZE0Mu2W3klMr-NMg,10/3/2020,4 star rating,"I rarely write reviews and do so when there is a level of uniqueness matched with quality. This is a hole in the wall, family run business (which seems to have been there for generations).  I was surprised at the selection of food and was very happy with the assortment.  This place had the feel of an authentic Japanese diner/izakaya. From the dim lighting to the trotusic playing in the background, the only needed to add to make the biance complete would be some smoking salarymen.  But I digress...The food was great and the service was pleasant. I wondered how much of the stuff was made in house and if their wasabi sidling my eel avocado roll was grated fresh.  Being a bit chilly, I also had their tonkatsu-shoyu ramen which was no-frills fantastic. This place was breath of fresh air in a time of showy pretentious restaurants that seem to focus more on aesthetics than substance. TLDR - Solid on food and service. Will be back with friends."
3795,D8TXbeZE0Mu2W3klMr-NMg,10/1/2021,5 star rating,"The food is excellent, and the unagi for two is really special. I recommend the chicken wings, chicken gizzard skewer, soft shell crab, and agedashi tofu as well. The service isn't the best, but the hostess is doing her best handling the whole restaurant."

3800,LSOpxBBa217HxnJ7VnY2WQ,7/12/2018,3 star rating,The tables are usually extremely dirty and their largest booth has a broken table that wobbles and can cause your drink to spill. But overall the quality of the food is great besides their chicken nuggets that often times don't taste fresh or even remotely like chicken!

3804,LSOpxBBa217HxnJ7VnY2WQ,1/6/2011,3 star rating,"Another day of training, another fast food lunch. I haven't been to a Wendy's in a while and it is usually not one of my go to places by but the my 99 cent sign caught my eye. So I went in. It was about 12 so the lunch rush was beginning. Not familiar with the value menu I waited until I got to be next to make up my mind. I ordered 2 orders of the spicy nuggets with barbecue sauce, a value-sized French fries and a Double Stack. The order was ready in less than 5 minutes. The food was fresh and hot. I might be back soon. Loving the new French fries with the skin on and nice amount of saltiness and crispiness."
3805,LSOpxBBa217HxnJ7VnY2WQ,6/26/2014,1 star rating,They are the absolute slowest fast food restaurant. OMG! Snails move 10 times faster. If you are in a rush don't waste your time

3807,YYuuOeD_vkboZkZy1kTTrQ,10/4/2022,4 star rating,"This one star Michelin restaurant was definitely busy and popping on a Tuesday night. We were seated immediately and accommodated. Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. We started out with drinks. I got the pisco sour and my cousin got themargaritas, which were both delicious. For the food we started our Taco Tuesday with fish tacos. The fish tacos looked good, but there is a specific way they should be consumed. The fish was salty but the flavors would be balanced when each bite is chased down by a bite of the radish. I'd definitely return to try more of their tacos. For the entrees, we ordered the Mole de Piaxtla   which tasted amazing, the sauce is on point. My cousin thought it's one of the best moles he ever had. The dish came with tortillas and rice and beans.  We also had to order the Charmorro de Borrego al Huaxamole which braised in lamb shank. The lamb shank was huge and it would 2-3 people. The meat was so tender that it fell off the bone. We took the leftover lamb shank home. And finally we had to get dessert. We ordered the flan and tres leches cake. The tres leches was amazing and flan was on point too. Personally I loved the tres leches cake that I ordered another one to go. Definitely worth trying this spot. I'd definitely come back to try their other dishes and cocktails."
3808,YYuuOeD_vkboZkZy1kTTrQ,10/14/2022,4 star rating,"We were only able to get a reservation at 5pm for a party of two. Sadly, but unsurprisingly, there is no happy hour here at this early time! I guess being a Michelin one star affords you the opportunity to charge full price for drinks and have ppl flock to the doors this early on a workday.My friend and I got the margaritas. I thought it was a little on the sweeter side, but still very good. We weren't super hungry as we both stupidly ate lunch at a very late time. She enjoyed her tacos. I thought the mole was fine. The first time I had mole was in Tulum and I don't think any mole could compare.The tres leche was very good!"
3809,YYuuOeD_vkboZkZy1kTTrQ,10/15/2022,3 star rating,My friend and I were craving a michelin experience outside of Manhattan and saw/heard good things about Casa Enrique so decided to come here. Upon entering we were put on the wait list for about 30 minutes and sat at the bar and ordered a drink while waiting.We started with table side guac and ordered it spicy- it was unfortunately not spicy at all but after adding some of the table side salsas esp the spicy ones it had the perfect spice consistency. we also ordered the vegetarian tacos that had mushroom cooked to look/taste like chicken which were seasoned well but since I know what chicken tastes like it was missing that juicyness from chickeni ordered the chicken enchiladas for myself which was so filling i took most of it home for leftovers but the sauce was so rich and the enchilada itself was good but again i needed to really do it up with the tableside sauces to make it spicy. last the tres leches which i was so disappointed over!!! seriously it had hints of a sweet liquor and the milk consistency wasnt as fluffy or milky. the icing on the top was heavy and thick and took away from the cake itself. not gonna lie very surprised they have a star as i didnt see anything special from my experience or the food but its definitely better than the average mexican spot!
3810,YYuuOeD_vkboZkZy1kTTrQ,1/16/2023,3 star rating,"I may have gone to Casa Enrique in the past but I thought reservations weren't a thing and was surprised they took them now. Would advise getting a reservation if possible instead of walk in. The little snacks they brought beforehand with the 3 sauces was so good-although I enjoyed the mildest of the sauces. Not a super spicey person in terms of food but drinks is different. I was very underwhelmed with the margaritas I think, I had a spicey, mango, and I believe aguachile. They weren't strong enough, nor spicey. The ceviche we got was on the daily special and I believe some sort of shrimp, it was definitely tastey and a unique blend of flavors. The chorizo tacos were good but small in size and wish there was a third. I may come back with different expectations of the drink menu."
3811,YYuuOeD_vkboZkZy1kTTrQ,10/9/2022,5 star rating,"Casa Enrique never disappoints with their authentic Mexican cuisine. Relaxed laid back atmosphere with delicious cocktails (highly recommend getting a spicy margarita), appetizers (get the ceviche!), and main dishes (I had the roasted pork ribs). The Mole comes highly recommended as well and is very popular, but it's a little too sweet for my taste. Finished everything off with a chocolate custard dessert with whipped cream and crushed cookies which was incredible. They recently maintained their 1-Star Michelin rating for 2022-2023, which is well deserved. I definitely recommend checking this place out if you're in the mood for authentic Mexican cuisine. Just don't forget to get the ceviche!"
3812,YYuuOeD_vkboZkZy1kTTrQ,2/21/2023,5 star rating,"We dined on a Monday night, and it was super busy! Please make a reservation or you'll regret it! We had flavorful dishes and friendly service and enjoyed the cozy atmosphere.Some of the standout dishes we had We're the sopecitos and tacos de suadero. For our mains, we had  Pozole de mi Tia and Chamorro de Borrego al Huaxamole! Best lamb I've had!  To pair with the food, we tried the bla bla bla,  la tentadora with a spicy rim and a few of the margaritas - the favorite was the strawberry! And a carajillo. For deserts, we had the horchata Icecream and the 3 leches! Don't skip dessert Overall, if you are in the Long Island City area and looking for delicious authentic Mexican food, Casa Enrique is definitely worth a visit."
3813,YYuuOeD_vkboZkZy1kTTrQ,12/19/2022,5 star rating,"Worth the hype. A Michelin started Mexican restaurant that is the furthest thing from a stuffy fine dining restaurant. There are so many Mexican classics on the menu, it is quite a difficult ordering decision. The enchiladas in salsa verde are probably my favorite main that I've tried here. The tacos make a very nice appetizer - we loved the suadero tacos. Make sure to make a resy as far ahead as you can."
3814,YYuuOeD_vkboZkZy1kTTrQ,12/8/2022,5 star rating,"Casa Enrique is a tapas-style portion menu. Everything was smaller. My friend and I sat outside for dinner. We had Patricia as our waitress. She was good at her job. We ordered guacamole and crab tacos to share. They were pretty good. The crab tacos were terrific! I'm glad I ordered that to try it. Then my friend got some tacos. I think it was beef, but not 100 percent sure. She said it was good. I ordered the special, which was sea bass. The fish was served with sweet corn and crunchy noodle. The fish was cooked to perfection. It was crispy on top via grill/broil and not fry, just the way I like it. We were very pleased with our dinner."
3815,YYuuOeD_vkboZkZy1kTTrQ,12/16/2022,5 star rating,"Casa Enrique is truthy worthy of its Michelin rating; the food, service, & ambiance are all on point! I truly appreciate the relaxed vibe, they aren't pretentious nor are they trying to be. They serve well-made food & drinks & are able to pass on a smile & how are you while doing it. I went with my bestie for brunch on weekend & from the moment we walked in until we left, it was perfection. I imagine their whole menu is delish as everything we had was utterly divine. Treat yourself & go to Casa Enrique... I can't wait to go back & try more!"
