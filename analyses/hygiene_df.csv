Chicken noodle soup was delicious and a gift from heaven after walking in this cold and windy weather. Excellent location, highly recommended."
24,24,9dqJrTzx0GvBNb-J0VyeGg,2022-01-23,2 star rating,Strawberry cake* - is delicious but I found a freakin eye lash on one of the slices I had ordered.Door Dash price $6.75 per slice. I photographed the good piece in the photos. Still gave this other slice a chance and the cake is very fluffy. It's not super sweet and it's very creamy. The strawberries on-top and inside of the cake are very fresh and taste yummy.Do I recommend this location? Only if the location seems clean enough. Kind of scared to order again.

So many people spoke highly of this place and my expectations did not reflect my experience.I had a 9:30 reservation and 1/3 people in my party arrived on time. I'll admit, the other 2 including myself arrived about 15 minutes later. You would think their grace period allotted for a 15 minute grace period then you'd immediately be sat down. That was not the case. Unfortunately we arrived and waited 45 minutes before we sat down. Granted, we took pictures in the meantime (in their beautiful hallway that was monitored closely by their security guard that can make one feel very uncomfortable AND you have a 2 minute time limit to take photos).... This is first time I've ever heard of such a thing.Now we finally sit down and greeted by 1 person that turned out NOT to be our waiter. We must've met about 3 different servers/helpers/kitchen aids. The food came out very quickly and the temperature was perfect. I was so excited to eat their peking duck but was GRAVELY disappointed to see how much OIL AND GREASE followed each piece. Now all of us fuck eaters know what we're signing up for when we order duck - it's fatty and tasteful. Their version was just GREASE. I couldn't even finish it. I'm not sure if they rushed it because we were the last seating of the night but it was not what I wanted.Now towards the end of our meal we're ready for the bill. One of the 3 gentlemen that assisted us came over but ignored me and then proceeded to switch his attention to the other party behind us. No big deal. We just wish he came back sooner so we can get out of there and go home. We didn't get a good look at the bill but just paid quickly. Fast forward a few days later I reached out to them to request a copy of the bill. It legit took them 5 days to send me a PDF of the bill. I've spoken to 3 different people, and they were the least bit helpful with the exception of one hostess with a French accent. Thank you to them!Ultimately, the bar tenders are nice, the food is a solid 7/10 minus the duck and the drinks are tasteful. I didn't enjoy my experience and wish I got the experience I pictured to celebrate my birthday. And I wish we were treated with royalty like I've seen with other clients. Just not my cup of tea."

The staff was friendly and quick. The food was great and the margaritas were tasty and a good amount of tequila. The environment is clean and comfortable. If you like Mexican food this is a safe bet."

The girl wasn't even paying attention to anything I was telling her and had the nerve to get an attitude when I started getting aggressive with her. It took me 20 mins to get my order done I couldn't even enjoy my lunch because of all the time I spent in there.  Chipotle isn't the same this location just hired people that want to come to work to hang out it wasn't clean there wasn't any napkins or eating utensils stocked .

As expected, I ordered the Kwason and it did not disappoint. The goat cheese caked between the soft scrambled eggs gave the sandwich a special touch. It was delicious and costs $9. I also ordered a drip coffee (they use Partners coffee) and a chocolate croissant for the road. Staff was extra friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients. The shop is very cute, clean, and minimalistic. There's also indoor seating. I definitely recommend Early and will return."

The Mongolian Beef...I thought I knew what it would taste like bc I've had it elsewhere and it was delicious...well let me be the first to say don't order this. I didn't rate them low because the dish wasn't good, it was what transpired after. So I get the dish and immediately I knew I made a mistake. It looked very weird, the beef and sauce was grayish, and there were all these crunchy noodles, I tasted it and was repulsed. So I called the waiter and told her how sorry I was, this actually has never happened to me before, so I didn't know what to do. I ordered something else and it tasted fine. Also the appetizers were good and everyone else liked their food. So the food is generally good. I just don't like that:1. They seemed personally offended that I didn't like the dish and the older lady who may be a manager or owner, not sure, but she was so nice to me in the beginning and then once this happened, she would walk pass my table and literally give me dirty looks. Just an awkward feeling to have for someone handling your food. I guess it's true what they say, don't return dishes back to the kitchen (or attempt to in my case). 2. They insisted I keep the dish and wrapped it up to go, but I told them I didn't like it lol. And they charged me for it at the end. I threw it away outside (sorry again). Yes I get it was my mistake for ordering it, but still a weird way to handle it from a management perspective. And that's why I wouldn't go back."

Note: the size is ""lunch size"" meaning smaller than usual.  My friend got chicken with pad thai noodles and I got chicken with massuman curry, which came with rice.  We both got tom yum soup as the appetizer, which was delicious - tart and savory.  My curry was good too, with a decent amount of chicken. I also got a mango mimosa, which hit the spot.  It wasn't too sweet or watered down, as they can be.The atmosphere was fine - enough room to seat everyone and not too cramped. Service was good.  Bathroom was clean. I saw some pick up orders come through as well.  Would come back, especially for the lunch special."

The food again is delicious and spectacular.  During a busy time the waitress still tended to us while juggling to make the drinks. This time I ordered the BEC brioche, the egg is so soft, smooth and silky. It is not dry and overcooked like all other places that rushed to make eggs. When the plate came to the table, the sandwich is still steaming hot which is what I like about this place. Cooked to order and they put their time to making it good and delicious. The caramelized onions topped the sandwich off with the additional kick of flavor! Also ordered the banana brulee. The pancakes never fail - its still fluffy and soft. One thing I suggest for the establishment is to have better ventilation. The smoke from cooking fumes up to the seating area. The constant smell of oil is not always pleasing. I'm leaving with happy belly full of delicious food but smelling like food on my clothes and jacket."

We chose to sit at the back since they kept the door ajar on a cold day. We were offered menus immediately but our order was not taken till a tad later. We noticed there's only one service person and one in the kitchen. The cups of coffee were served right away. My disappointment was that my coffee arrived cold. I requested for oatmilk, perhaps that's what did it? The extended wait time for the food caused the others to have their coffee turn cold as well. The Matcha Brûlée was delicious! It had the solid taste and texture that was a delight. The farmer's plate was gone in 60 seconds. I had a taste of the home fries and thought it was good. I didn't get the chance to try the original stack.Do come and give this place a try, but be prepared for the wait time. It's also cash only."

The staff was pretty quick to clean the table and sanitize it. My husband ordered a latte and some breakfast plate & I went with the Chakra Waffles and latte with oat milk. OH MAH GAWD... my plate was HUGE. It was just loaded with a lot of stuff lol. Nutella explosion I say. Plenty of whipped cream, of course. I really appreciated the generosity but man, I was worried I fear for the risk of getting a heart attack. I was actually overwhelmed and had to share some with my husband because it was just too much!The coffee was okay, nothing to rave about. On top of that, they didn't ask to see our vaccination cards. So I was kinda eating in fear... and tried to finish up as fast as I could. Really wish we had a chance to check out this place before the pandemic so we may have had a much better experience.For now, I'm happy to give 4 stars."

When the order came out, the lady at the register literally threw my lunch and coke on the counter which I thought was very rude.  I told her that I was staying to eat when I received a dirty look in return.  (possibly because I was black) Although I'm black Korean.  I didn't  want to make a fuss because I was with my 3 years old granddaughter.  After removing a dead fly off the seat, I opened up the lunch and found chicken and broccoli drenched in soy sauce with dried up fried rice.  The food was so salty that we had to throw it out.  It was the worst Chinese food that I ever had."

Plenty of times when we do a Costco run, which is only two blocks away. We have always had the curiosity to go there, but tend to forget that it's there because it's in the middle of the block kind of hidden next to the post office. But I do have to say that I was highly highly unexpected and what happened and how the food was there when we went for breakfast. Me and my friend got breakfast. I had the three a platter with turkey bacon and corn beef hash my friend had the breakfast with pancakes and a side of corn beef hash. The platters are actually a really good price and value in terms of size for what you're paying and getting the only thing that was a little surprising to us. It was the size of the corn beef hash, which is almost 6 dollars for a side of it and when you get it, it is really small. But the fact of the matter is that it is home made corn beef hash so it was the best corn beef hash I have had in a really really long time you can taste the real corn beef and not process canned corn beef hash. I have gone to many diners in the area of Queens, and this by far took the number one spot of corn beef hash especially when it's really hot it taste so good That has alone made it even more amazing. The staff is wonderful very attentive and it's clean so I highly recommend this place. If you go for breakfast try the corn beef hash I haven't tried everything else, but just on breakfast alone it made my day it was satisfying and they are very quick service. They're very friendly, so please please give it a chance. I am looking forward to going there again and even trying something new I see they do have a lot of pieces I'm curious about that so if you're in the area, queen, center mall or the Rego Park Center look for this diner, you won't be disappointed."

The salad that comes out while waiting for the food we ordered was so good and refreshing, every dish portion size was good, price was affordable, and taste was all amazing. Everything tasted so authentic and flavorful, and each dish was so clean and well seasoned. I would definitely come back here for the dishes that I tried, and to try many of their other dishes! One thing to just note is that the mapo tofu here was PRETTY spicy.. and gave my tongue a tingly feeling! As I kept eating more, my water also started to taste a little funky and sparkly.. I really don't know what kind of spice they put in there to season it but don't get me wrong, it was absolutely delicious, but it just wasn't something that I was expecting! Overall, this place is awesome for Szechuan food. Don't forget to get their house special candies as you walk out!! It is also so yummy (:"

The male server seemed like he didn't want to be there. We ordered twice. Both times, they missed many items that we ordered. When we told the waiter the first time, she didn't bother checking with the kitchen and instead just told us to submit another order. Food 1/5 ; We ordered rock shrimp maybe twice, first time it was tossed in the sauce, the second time it was not. Talk about consistency. Edamame was not salted. Gyoza was cold. Yellowtail tasted spoiled. The ""boat"" the food gets served in looks terrible. The areas where the screws are are rusty and the sides look moldy. Ambiance 0/5 ; Dingy. No music.

It's honestly a vibe of its own, I would say it's more than your local dive bar in south slope, maybe even a type of second home or pilgrimage type of place. The classic toys are all arranged across the top of room looking down at you and into your soul kind of like a ritual, perhaps you are the sacrifice that is being made? Anyways, I'm totally not a local but while visiting Brooklyn I fell in love with this place and wanted to go back for another round of the fruity flavored ciders. I had a strawberry cider that had the perfect balance of sweetness and alcohol. The ciders were the perfect night cap to an eventful evening, the bar tender was super sweet, cute young lady compared to myself. They have an outdoor patio as well, it was a bit too chilly for me to enjoy during that day but perhaps one day again soon I shall return to pay tribute to this gem of a find in Brooklyn. Cheers to Commonwealth!"

1068,1068,jYjJNB9qlmd6dbYZBaDjfw,2022-12-08,3 star rating,"It's dirty and rundown inside. They have a pretty big selection of different types of teas/tapiocas. The thing that sets this place apart is the 'egg' cups that they sell for a little bit of a upcharge. You can get your drink in a little dragon egg type thing if you want for a little over $7. The egg itself has a screw top. It's not really that water tight so be careful when you're shaking it. It's also kind of difficult since you have to hold the top, put the straw in and drink, then put the top back later. But then what do you do with the straw? It's very inconvenient on the go. If you're wanting to keep the egg as a souvenir I'm not sure what you'd do with it while wandering around. Just seems like a hassle - but a cute hassle. Service isn't that friendly and they sort of unceremoniously just hand you the drinks through the dragon's mouth. Minimally cool. Overall though, I don't think it's that much more expensive than the regular tapioca drink you can find here in the city. The taste was fine - not too sugary."
1075,1075,jYjJNB9qlmd6dbYZBaDjfw,2022-10-30,4 star rating,"[NYC BOBA TOUR STOP #39] My other stops on the boba tour: yelp.com/collection/4dXT… I believe this is actually the second time I've been to BIAO, but I genuinely do not remember what I got the first time or what I thought, so this is truly a clean slate. BIAO is just outside the main KTown block, and it's this little hole in the wall store, but it has a ton of character. I've actually been to Raccoon Cave, which is made by BIAO, and I have similar thoughts about the two places. I like that BIAO levels up the experience of getting boba by delivering it in through a lion's mouth, but it's a bit that I can see getting old quickly. Nevertheless, though, it's fun and fresh and different and my social anxiety GETS the want to deliver drinks that way. We ordered (rating): Ube Brown Sugar Boba Milk with Pudding (4/5), Grapefruit Green Tea (4/5)Honestly the brown sugar milk was pretty good. I remember going to Raccoon Cave and being underwhelmed because the ratio of milk to sugar was off, but this was much better. I did order the ube one, though, and I couldn't taste the ube very much. It all mixes to become the same color so you really forget you ordered ube in the first place. My friend is a huge fan of the grapefruit green tea, but it'd be nice if you could adjust the sweetness on the fruit teas because it's on the sweeter end. I found the boba to be on the smaller and stickier side. They were smaller than you'd expect them to be but bigger than what is typically called mini boba. And by ""stickier"" I mean that they tend to stick to your teeth and then it pulls away a little like gum. They were also slightly softer than I'd like, so that in combination with the stickiness was a little rough texture-wise, BUT they were brown-sugar coated so the taste was absolutely there."

We all ordered different versions of sandwiches, which are essentially pitas with falafel and veggies. All the veggies and the falafel were super fresh and came with two small containers of tzeziki sauce and pickles/olives. The food was served up quickly. The environment is clean and hip. There are large tables, all essentially high tops. The decor is industrial and is dark. Table tops were made of epoxy and chickpeas, which I found super quirky. The music is not that loud, and the overall feel of the restaurant facilities great conversations with the team. We did order some of the prepackaged baklava, which was ok but not the best ever. I would skip those if you're a baklava snob. Most importantly, the food is reasonably priced for a quick and healthy lunch. It definitely beats out some of the other Mediterranean places I have been to in the area."

1127,1127,BuoZEYr6Y8o_fX2xs060SA,2023-02-21,5 star rating,I stopped in here for pizza today with my son. The first thing that caught my eye was the grandma slices on the upper left corner in the glass. It was at precisely the same moment that someone ordered two slices of that same pizza ahead of us and also two pepperoni. My eyes flew to the pepperoni and that's what we got. One grandma slice and one pepperoni with 2 sodas. I paid $12.50. But before I did I noticed the cute decor on the walls idk what the official word for a pizza paddle is called but they had a lot of them all arranged in a cute sort of deconstructed puzzle and the dinning area was spacious and clean. The two young men were attentive assisting multiple ppl but there was one other guy with his shirt covered in flour he was nice his attitude was great and yeah I would definitely recommend for a simple pepperoni slice of pizza and definitely return.

Tiny bowls with subpar food. Who charges so much for such mediocre food in such small quantity? This is not Manhattan, this is Brooklyn, in the middle of a packed, busy, dirty, loud street. Who came up with such prices?This place is a tiny food & flower shop, but they put out outdoor tables in good weather to make some profit. This hole in a wall should not be charging such prices. Only one overwhelmed waitress was not capable of taking care of a full house of dinners. We got no service. No water. No checking in on anything. She didn't know the menu, so couldn't recommend anything or speak about any of the dishes. So not helpful. Spend your money elsewhere."

From the moment we walked in (3 guys and me), we got stares from the 4 patrons there.  We noticed it was empty, zero atmosphere, dirty feeling, but we walked up to the bar to order anyways to give it a try.  The bartender was less than friendly when we approached so we turned around and left before ordering.  I'd never give this place another chance...and it seemed like they were happy about it."

I am the friend mentioned that does not consume alcohol in a previous post and when I saw the owner's response, it is evident that a lack of accountability and respect for patrons is common place at every level in this establishment. The bar was sparsely populated, we came in without being ID'd (bars responsibility) and were simply enjoying the social environment. After standing and chatting for 20 mins into being there a group of folks got up and we noticed after 5 minutes of the tables remaining empty and that we should just take a seat at one of two empty tables. Within 5 minutes the bartender came over and asked if we are going to order a drink, I responded first saying no (because I no longer drink due to my sobriety). The bartender with a disgusting condescending attitude expeditiously stated ""then y'all need to get out.""  The owner's response takes no responsibility for the lack of respect for the customer. If it were an age thing, check our IDs, we are both over 30. If it were us bringing in anything from another establishment, you would've seen us drinking or whatever else you want to scapegoat. Wish y'all nothing but the worst. Cheers. 0/10. I would never recommend this place to any one. Do not go."

Now...as far as the food quality it is either burnt and thrown together with no reguard or stale because it's been sitting there without being bagged not to mention people getting wrong orders mixed in with there food. Lastly and this is the comical part of it all is the free food Being handed out to friends and family members. This location is in a major need of a face lift in employment and management."

I always thought it was JUngro, which I think means the ""right way"" in Korean. But I was meeting some co-workers here for lunch and realized it is JOngro, which is not a Korean word I know. I think I like my version better because it would be an apt description of how they prepare their food. Although finding the right way in can be confusing because there are no signs telling you to take the elevator to the second floor.I went with their lunch special and got the kalbi/short rib (with co-workers so a little formal for my usual LA style) and cold noodle soup. With food prices going up, the lunch special is a pretty good deal! I douse the noodle soup in vinegar and mustard and the noodles and broth hold up well. The kalbi is tender and pretty flavorful although i could use a little more char and a little more flavor. For the lunch special, the meat is cooked in the kitchen so we miss out on the tabletop grilling but we also do not walk out with the BBQ smell on our clothes so perfect for a working lunch. There are probably only a couple of places where the BBQ is The decor is old school and the space is huge, and service was attentive. Definitely recommend this place if you are in the city."

The worker offered me a choice of apricot or raspberry filled almond marzipan cookie that I ordered.  I have not seen them in two flavors so this was a good indication!  Not!  The almond marzipan cookie tasted so stale it must have been a leftover from 1935.  It was wrapped in plastic wrap.  I thought the bakery was being thoughtful but no! Not even plastic cling wrap could keep this cookie from becoming hard and dry like camel dung!  I cut a teeny tiny piece.  The almond paste ring that sits on top of the cookie should be soft and chewy.  It tasted like sand in my mouth.  No almond taste only sugar. I had a tummy ache right after.  For sure this one's going straight to the garbage!  $4.95 is way to much to pay for dried up camel dung!  No wonder my initial instincts were right.  I should have fled.  The store has many pastries and cookies but all do not seemed to be touched!  Beware of bakeries that have tons of cookies and pastries that are perfectly filled to the brim.  When customers don't buy, you get stale stuff!  Beware of strangers on the street with bad taste buds and trust your own gut instinct!"

Aromatic from the sesame oil and garlic, and lightly sour from the vinegar marinade. I could eat a massive bowl of this on a hot summer day. Pork Yumplings: Deliciously fried. Flavorful meaty filling that's well-balanced by the thick crispy dumpling skin -- def heftier than most dumplings I've had in my life, which is not a bad thing in the slightest. They also heap tiny scallion coils on top, along with chili oil. Dumpling + scallion + chili oil is a goated combo.Beef noodle soup: Sad sad sad. The primary reason Yumpling got docked to 3.5 stars. This was disappointing, or maybe I'm just spoiled by the noodles at neighboring Noodlecraft. The broth was thin and felt more like liquid sauces mixed with hot water. The noodles were okay; beef chunks were on the dry side. It was the broth that really did it in for me, though. Would not recommend.Yumpling is on the pricier side. I got takeout, so no comment on the ambience (it seemed nicely decorated from the 30 seconds I spent inside). I think I just whiffed with the beef noodle soup (majorly whiffed). If the rest of the menu is more like the cucumbers and pork dumplings, then Yumpling's doing just fine."

Nice and clean restaurant with reasonably okay service when compared to similar restaurants in Chinatown.We tried the whole Peking Duck. Sad to report but it lacked flavor, seemed like it was flash cooked, and the skin lacked the crispy consistency you'd expect from a Peking Duck. They have some nerve calling themselves Peking Duck House. What a shame! Tried the dumplings as well and it was ""doughy"" and raw. Lacked basic flavors.Average chicken fried rice.Now the hunt continues for better option."

The menu looked pretty big as well so I could see Rosalia's being a nice place to meet up with friends."

I got the Jo Bowl and a matcha latte and both were fantastic. The Jo Bowl has so many fresh ingredients and I love how vegetables are the star. I wouldn't say it was the most flavorful dish I've ever had but it definitely felt very clean and satisfying. We came during Monday lunch rush and still got our food within a reasonable amount of time. Would love to come back and try some more of their menu items!

Wait staff consistently presented the wrong meal to the wrong person.  Service was agonizingly slow and inattentive.  No attempt was made to clean the table between courses.  Wait staff switched halfway through meal.  The restaurant was overcrowded and I will never forget the waiter clearing a neighboring table using a stake knife to roll muscle shells onto a plate.  Not fine dining."

Yea, no!I ordered an eclair and a slice of Black Forest cake.When I got home and decided to have the eclair, I cut it in half and noticed a foul smell. It was the custard that was bad. A waste of $$$.  Stuff like this angers me because it's in a touristy area where people are not likely to return to bring back bad food. Since I was only in the city to go to the camera store, I too was a tourist this time.So no recourse to them other than this review as a warning to others, check the food before you leave.The good thing was the bread that was my original reason for going into this place"

I doubt I'll be returning after the rudeness of the female server yesterday . Such a shame as I wanted to go back before I return to Paris.First of all, we will see it all the way in the back when they were other seats more towards the front. Then we had so many different servers, we had no idea who is who.Secondly, they screwed up the order but then got it straight which is OK. The muscles were wonderful very plentiful I really wanted to try the escargot but the bus boy was the one who is taking the order and kind of didn't have an idea what it was.When the bill came, it was recently priced my friend gave the server his portion in cash and, mine was on a card. Normally when you return change you return all of it you don't feel entitled to keep money. Apparently, the female server felt entitled to keep all of it and didn't even say thank you I called her over to get the change back that she should've given and she just gave me a dirty look she didn't give it back about 20 minutes later.This definitely was a very sour ending. Oh well ..on the way out, I was asking for the manager and the bus boy was sort of smirking & spoke broken English , then he said he was the manager I told him what happened and all he said he'll talk to her.I highly doubt that will happen. It's a shame, because I really wanted to return here but I'm pretty sure she'll end up sitting in our food we definitely do not feel welcome there ever again"

I'm only talking about their baguette as this is all I tried along with an okay coffee.The baguette was similar to baguettes one buys from supermarkets. It was not crunchy on the outside. Inside was a doughy mess. Flavorless. As I chewed it felt as it were falling apart in my mouth. I had only taken a piece of the baguette - so I took the remaining almost full $4.00 baguette and threw it in the garbage. I thought about taking it home and toasting it to see if that would help but I was too disappointed.This is a basically a wholesale factory with a storefront.

The stuffed rice grape leaves are served very hot which we were not accustomed to and the lamb gyro had a hot Mayo type dressing. The pitas were a little old. Overall the food was decent but not outstanding. Price was a little steep at $64 (w/credit card fees). The service was excellent and kitchen is very clean.

We came here for takeout and the service was fairly quick. You can dine-in or takeout. The ambience was chill. There's a good amount of seating. Staff was friendly and accommodating. The place was clean. There's no doubt about it that we chose the best pizza I've had in a long time. The slices are a decent size and the taste makes you want a whole pie to yourself. Slices are about $4 each. They offer a selection of sodas and juices. They offer specialty pizzas in addition to, regular pizzas, salads, calzones, appetizers, hero's, wraps, pasta dishes. For extra toppings it's about $3-$3.50 per topping. I'd highly recommend for the food, service, and taste! I'd definitely come back again when it town."

The food was good. It wasn't the best Ethiopian food I had, especially coming from Hawaii, they are legit way better Ethiopian foods on Oahu, but this is not the worst food. When it comes to their service, it was just nasty. I've noticed that they are kind to Caucasian customers. But they were very cold and unkind to me, and I was the only asian there that night. When I was ready to check out, they told me they don't accept discover cards. But I only brought that one credit card and didn't bring any cash. The waitress forced and escorted me to go to the grocery store next door to withdraw cash. And when she saw I was charged $1.99, she said: oh it's ok. Just $1.99. When we came back, I called their manager, and offered to have them cover the atm fee. But they did not cover it, and they demanded me for tips while lecturing me: if you use a discover card, you need to tell us in advance. I told her, no, I don't, because on the door, there's sigh saying they accept all cards."
3023,56,tbg4gR3jUUllR28cySo2kg,2022-01-20,4 star rating,"Excellent Ethiopian food with options for all types of food preferences. Their vegan sample was to die for. Even the meat eaters liked it better than theirs (the doro wat had no flavor comparatively)! So many incredible, full flavors and the injera just absorbed it all so well. Their cocktails were also very unique and had a nice twist to them. Servers were very kind and made great recs. 4/5 stars because the service is usually quite slow (although everyone is super kind and as long as you're not in a rush it's just more reason to enjoy!), and the bathrooms were not clean. All in all, this is some of the best Ethiopian food in the area."

Patacon Steak seemed to be well done a day old and reheated. Like trying to chew tire rubber with no flavor. The plantain top and bottom hard as a frisbee disk. The other sandwhich with ham was also stale tasting and tortilla a little less rock like. Empanadas were okay the only part of the meal that was tolerable. Most went in the trash and this was $38 dollars later. Ugg!!!We had driven from Bayside as we had read such good things were so excited and wanted to love this place. No such luck. This was a disaster and we've eaten at many varied places to try something new and usually enjoy it.I would Not reccomend to eat here or take to go either as we did.Huge disappointment and 1 star rating and that's a gift only because of the empanadas.

As soon as I walked in and saw Chairman Mao's Favorite Braised Pork a true signature dish, on the menu, I knew this place was legit. A onetime resident of Hunan, my husband claims that the food at Silky Kitchen is as good as one might find in Hunan itself. A self-defined fast casual spot, Silky Kitchen offers top-notch restaurant-level rice and noodle dishes, with spiciness customizable from regular to medium to spicy to extra spicy. We ordered the hot and sour fish noodle soup and the  stir-fried chicken with chili paste over rice. The former was mind-blowingly delicious. The fish was so tender and the soup perfectly tart. Every bite was heavenly. So heart-warming for a cold winter day. The latter was too spicy for my taste, although my husband, a spice fiend, loved it. The service was quick and efficient. The space was large, clean, and very pleasant, comfortably fitting multiple strollers. We will surely be returning--to try Chairman Mao's Favorite Braised Pork no less."

The stir fried chicken was good. A majority of their items are spicy so I'd recommend checking with the waiter to ensure you know what you're ordering, the waiter was extremely patient with us and helpful. The sweet rice cake was good as well but not the best. Personally though if you're in the mood for Chinese I'd recommend going to Chinatown for more affordable food."

The staff was super friendly, our register guy even went out of his way and set up a cute table and chairs outside of the restaurant so that we can enjoy the beautiful weather while we indulge in our empanadas. We ordered quite a few and they were all super delicious and flavorful, the favorites were the Shrimp, Ropa Vieja, and the loaded chicken that came with tomatoes, bacon and cheese. Being Dominican myself, it took me to my childhood drinking the Morír Soñando (to die dreaming). If you've never had it, give it a try! it's a silky concoction of orange juice, sugar, evaporated milk over ice. It's a nice smooth light drink perfect for a beautiful summer day.I wholeheartedly recommend Empanada City, whether you're looking for a snack, lunch or dinner and make sure to try the Morir Soñando you won't find a more refreshing drink then this."

Everything is $2 off until 8pm. Which rounds everything on tap out to be about $5. After happy hour ends there's canned beer for $4 and something as well called 'ass juice'. I was tempted. Trust me. I was tempted. But the ass juice will have to wait for another day. Someone said it tastes sweet. But they didn't comment on if it's actually good or not. It was just a 'it's sweet/no comment' kind of description. There's a pool table in the back and I guess they allow outside food because they didn't seem to have a problem when I brought in slices from a $1.50 pizza shop next door. Wasn't too crowded when I went and surprisingly more sanitary than other dives I've been to. So kuddos for that.

After you order a bunch of bagels they throw them all in the bag with the condiments on the bottom so it's not like they're actually buttering the bagels for you.  They don't separate the bagels either - all the flavors mixing together in the bottom of the bag.  At least use a sleeve / divider / bagel bag. Why in the world would it take 15 to 20 minutes to place bagels into a bag?  It doesn't make sense to take a 15-second order and mix it in to the queue with hot food - they should be a separate bagel and pastry person.

They don't serve food but they'll allow you to bring your food inside, just clean up after yourself. The outdoor patio is super cute and during the summer, it's always busy and fun."

We thought it would be a little more upbeat, happening, modern.  It's clean bar is fine faces the street so you can have a drink and view Mc Donalds and the Street. We had two Prosecco's, poured from the small personal bottles, and a espresso Martin.  The martini was made fresh with real espresso, bartender did a good job. We left and headed elsewhere."

So I went to the register and when I got my food it was in take out containers. Sat at the bar regardless, and ordered a few more items which were served in plates and was billed afterward for them. I would recommend this place if you want to try the fusion stuff because their crunchy tacos are the better of the item that are on the menu.  The soft tortilla tacos, personally, were disappointing. Was there from LA and I know our street vendors would give any taco place outside of LA a run for their money. I am spoiled in that regard and biased as well because I know what a good soft tortilla taco should be. Maybe use better quality tortillas to give your soft tacos a little more umph, because at best they're mediocre. The tortilla should not be an afterthought. It is part of what makes a taco great. I tried all except their tofu, veggie, and lentil tacos (no judgment if you liked veggie tacos just not my preference). I liked the crunchy curry beef best only because it is what I expected something fusion to taste like. It was crunchy, the taste was there. Also liked the Chipotle shrimp taco. It reminded me of shrimp tempura but with more taste. Overall a place to try if you are feeling adventurous. I do not think I would go again unless I absolutely wanted to feel the texture and specific flavor mixture of the crunchy tacos. All else was just ok. Try it for yourself for sure if you are there."

They allowed us to sit at the bar while we waited. Since it was over an hour wait, we decided to just get a table and order and wait there. The staff here was very welcoming and understanding. I thought we were going to be seated inside, but we were taken outback, which to my surprise, was heated! Once seated, it took a bit, but a sever came over and took our orders. Unfortunately, our server wasn't as welcoming as the other staff, and that seemed to be a continuous theme with him. We all ordered steak and eggs with a side grits. The food didn't take too long to come out, but wasn't the quickest either. The food was great, we all had no complaints there. My friend asked the salt and pepper and that request was ignored, and my other friend inquired 30 minutes later, which was then brought over. Every other request was met with a side eye or an attitude-- we didn't understand because we didn't ask for much, he never checked on us,  never provided water, and when it was time for dessert, I was provided a dirty spoon. The hostess saw me relentlessly attempting to get his attention and came over and was very apologetic-- I just didn't care to be ignored and didn't understand why he such a poor disposition. The vibe was pretty cool otherwise-- they had a DJ and played mostly reggae and a little R&B. I was a little turned off by the server, but say this is a decent brunch option for 90 minute bottomless mimosas. The menu is limited, however, $48 pp with an entree and mimosas is a solid deal."

We ordered the Chef's Tasting menu and I'd say we have a bit more of an Asian palette so our preferences and experience can definitely vary from person to person. Some dishes I'd like to highlight is the swordfish, risotto, and deer? or duck (unfortunately don't remember) but those represented great flavors, textures and temperature. Melted in the mouth.The cucumber radish dish definitely has potential - I do wish it was a little bit colder to give it a more refreshing, clean taste.The fish with cauliflower on top also has great potential. Enjoyed the fish in itself but the flavors didn't feel like they blended as thoroughly. Desserts were solid. Overall was a lovely first time experience here"

They have specials Monday - Thursday; I went on a Monday night and took advantage of their Monday all night happy hour drink specials ($7 per drink).  My group and I had their sangrita and mojitos.  Sangrita is a frozen mix of the margarita and sangria, one drink you are good, two drinks, who knows where the night will lead!  As far as food, my o my their dishes are great.  We got the chicken tenders/fries and Mango juice off the kids menu for our little one.  The fries were string fries, crunchy and good flavor.  The chicken tenders were good too and the Mango juice got rave reviews.  We got a chicken empanada from the appetizers, although on the smaller size for a $4 empanada, it is full of flavor and comes with a tasty dipping sauce. Main dishes we went with the vegan bowl ($12), arroz con pollo ($17), and pollo a la plancha ($19).  Some of their prices increased from the last time I came, but their portions and flavor stays consistent (which not all restaurants stay true to).  Everyone gave two thumbs up for their meals and as usual, I absolutely love the pollo a la plancha; rice, beans, maduros, and a breast of chicken sliced and covered in a kick ass lemon butter sauce.  My group surprised with a birthday flan, they gobbled it up and it had whipped cream drops around the plate. Obviously I still recommend this spot for anyone looking for a good time with great drinks and even better food."

The packaging and portions are also different. The mango Lassie was disgusting, it tasted like thye purposefully used sour ingredients that has gone bad.

The basmati rice had huge chunks of cardamom pods that are extremely unpleasant to bite into without knowing they are there. The chicken momos were the strongest menu item that we ordered but their presentation has completely changed and they don't look like any Momo I have seen personally. They also came with no sauce. Perhaps the most egregious menu item was my shrimp tikka masala. What I received was a bland Curry devoid of spice or flavor, with criminally small salad shrimp. If you have ever ordered Chinese American takeout and gotten shrimp fried rice or shrimp lo mein, you know the very tiny salad shrimp that I'm talking about. These were even smaller than that, and for an $18 entree it's criminal to charge prices for garbage. These miniscule shrimp were dry and rubbery, completely inedible and almost hilarious in the fact that they were being presented as real food.

The other recent reviewers are right, this is no longer the same business that served great tasting food with decent portions and friendly service.I ordered my usual Chicken Tikka Masala and Vegetable Samosas. I have NEVER seen a tikka masala separate before in my life until tonight. There was so much oil that I nearly threw up just looking at it. The few pieces of chicken in it were lost among the curdled mess, tasted none of the tikka marinade, and the little I tasted was bland. The rice was bland and dry. The samosas were large sized but tasted awful. I don't know if they gave me expired food or it was supposed to be that sour. The mint chutney was a blend of sugar water and mint.I must have thrown 95% of the food into the trash. Waste of money and time."

I wasn't all that hungry because I had to eat before hand or I would have fainted by the time it was 7 pm. My guy had a heavy lunch so we kept it light and simple. I got some uni nigiri and he got some salmon nigiri. Although we cannot eat, we always can drink. We shared a sake and it was pretty good. It was called ""A drop to the soul?"" I don't know if it touched or even tickled my soul, but it was clean sake. For $20, not bad at all. I had time to study the menu because my guy was running late. I looked at other people's reviews and pics to get a general idea of what I wanted. I wasn't all that impressed with the items on the menu and they were missing tamago and ikura in the a la carte section... The uni wasn't the freshest looking uni when it came out. Overall, an okay place. The staff is super nice and the interior is very Japanese. I am not sure if it was intended for me, but when I came back from the bathroom, there was a space heater by me.

We ordered the regular grandma's pork soup dumplings and also the pan fried soup dumplings. Both were really great with a lot of flavor, but the original soup dumplings were better because there was less breading.I also ordered the pork shredded and garlic sauce, and it was so delicious. Definitely worth trying. They do not hold out on the garlic. they have a good lunch special here that includes an entrée, a spring roll and a soup for $15.

It is upscale fancy Chinese restaurant with lots of dim sum offering and some typical Chinese food at uptown prices.Lunch specials (egg drop soup + 1pc vegetable spring roll with bowl of rice) $15 with 2 rice plates at $17/18. We ordered:2 lunch specials- Kung pao chicken + hot pot chicken and 1 roast duck noodle soup. We ordered pork soup dumplings + crunchy wontons for appetizers. The appetizers came last. The 2 chicken dishes were very similar but kung pao is more saucy (chili oil). Both chicken dishes had similar seasoning/spice that gave us a werid after-taste and the chili oil seem to give us a werid numbing/tingling feeling in our lips. Both spring rolls were COLD (not even room temperature). Rice seems old/dried out. The noodles in the soup was different from picture on menu and looked like spaghetti noodles not Chinese noodles. The crunchy wonton are very crunchy but still pink/reddish (see photo). Soup dumpling barely had soup inside- was dried out. Next time we'll stick to chinatown for the soup dumplings.Bathrooms are nice and clean. Place is spacious and lovely. Great for groups and great service. There looks like there is a outside back patio.

Since the old front workers been gone the people at the counter have a bad attitude to the customers not all, but  especially the short guy that sometimes he is cooking and other times working the from counter.  To hear him tell a customer for asking questions about the cakes on display and calling them basically stupid and dont know how to read is pretty disgusting.   This really show me that his behavior and bad attitude he is the one with an IQ the size of his shoe!  If you don't know how to communicate with the customers in front and cant treat the customers with respect go back to the back of the kitchen and stay back there cooking!Happy Thanksgiving!!"

My friend and I sat at the one table for awhile, catching up and such, and the employees were very nice about it! We ordered (rating): Mango Green Tea with Boba (4/5), Dirty Brown Sugar Milk Tea with Boba (2.5/5)Okay, so what I loved about my dirty brown sugar milk tea was that the tea itself was very creamy. I always worry about watery milk teas, but this wasn't! I thought there was a solid tea flavor in there and that it was unique. It was a very pleasant surprise. The thing is, this felt like it was their regular milk tea with brown sugar along the side of the cup and because of that it was entirely too sweet. With the sugar level on this drink was not adjustable, this ended up feeling like straight up sugar being pumped into my veins. It had just the right hint of milk tea in it that kept me drinking it but man oh man will the dentist be happy to get money out of me with all the cavities he finds in a few months. That milk tea was really what saved the drink because I also found that the boba lacked chew and was slightly on the slippery side. For Manhattan boba, the prices are super decent ($5-6 range). I feel like usually I find myself paying $7+ for a cup now, so I'm glad places like Trutea still exist where they give it to us for a little bit cheaper. This is the type of boba place where I feel like I have to come back to form a full opinion on. I want to try a milk tea where I am able to adjust the sugar and maybe one of the fruit teas. My friend for the most part liked her mango green tea, but it definitely doesn't seem like it's made with fresh fruit. It is giving fruit syrup. That doesn't necessarily make it bad, though- it's just in this current market when so many boba places make fruit teas with fresh fruit you might be disappointed.

The shrimp spring rolls were crispy and juicy. The soup dumpling was okay. The Peking duck was very impressive as well - even compared to many restaurants in China or Hong Kong it has very high quality. Nice skin to meat ratio and smells so rich of duck oil. The second part of the Peking duck was also very well flavored and well balanced with the lettuce. The Chef fried rice was also very flavorful and act as a great filling end of the dinner."

6527,603,AxpsI4_tOI0sM6-KfOY9ig,2022-09-12,4 star rating,"Been here a few times pre-pandemic and during the pandemic as well, and I have to say that after eating here this past weekend, the food wasn't as good as I remembered it. Still a pretty good experience considering the nice ambience, service, and overall food taste. However, the value has probably decreased because some of the dishes were very small for the price. I'm not sure if this is because of shrinkflation, but regardless, I feel that there are other Szechuan restaurants in flushing that give you more bang for your buck (with the same or better taste). The good: get the classic appetizer with hanging strips of pork and cucumber over a spicy dipping sauce. Ate too fast and forgot to snap a pic of it. Double cooked pork was good, as was the braised pork belly (although I remember there being cherries in this dish pre-pandemic). My family thought that the pork belly used in these two dishes were excessively fatty but the taste was good. We also ordered the sour beef soup which I personally really enjoyed the taste of. The acidity also helped to cut the grease after all the pork belly. However, the portion size was smaller than the tomato soup (yielded about 5 small bowls). Bonus: the jasmine tea here is so so good. Super fragrant and served in beautiful teacups. The pickled cabbage they gift you as an appetizer is also very delicious. The so-so: We had a tomato fish soup with tofu , which was honestly pretty forgettable. It reminded me of the tomato base at HaiDiLao. Good, but imo not worth paying for at a restaurant. Lo mein was also pretty forgettable. I've had better wok hei at take out places. Not recommended: the la zhi ji (chicken with peppers). This is a classic szechuan dish but we were pretty disappointed here because the chicken didn't have any batter around it. As a result, there was very little crunch (if any). Also, the plate was small to begin with, and there were a ton of peppers on the plate and not a lot of chicken. This is the case in many restaurants, but there was a bigger proportion of peppers to chicken here, and the chicken wasn't even crispy. (Go to Lucky Chen for this dish. Executed better there.)"

I am not fond of chain restaurants and gyu kaku changed my mind!Went for lunch special which is a GREAT DEAL!! For bbq you can chose a set of miso soup, salad and 2 or 3 meats plus rice for a great deal. I did 3 meats for $20 and SUPERB!Meat was so tasty and tender. Sososososo good!!Service is fast and nice. Pretty attentive.Place is clean and going with a stroller they were very accommodating."

Both were extremely clean, and ventilated in that there was a vent on every table. To me, that's as good as outdoor dining, which matters, especially w Covid these days.  This branch wasn't so clean. The tables didn't have individual vents, and with teppanyaki, the food smell sticks to your clothes. So those vents matter. The food was good, but compared to the UWS/White Plains branch, these guys seem to not care as much. The rice (even if it was Japanese rice) was dry and seemed half a day old. The sauce bottles were all sticky. The table was sticky too. I ordered the tuna volcano, and the tuna seemed old, and the crispy rice at the bottom was more chewy than anything. The rest we ordered was ok. So, will I visit Gyu Kaku again? Definitely. Unfortunately, I won't be coming back to this branch."

The reason I love coming here is that they have a large selection of meats and items. The best part is that they have happy hours from the time they open to 5pm. This includes some of their food items as well as drinks!My boyfriend and I usually get the chef's favorite (serves 2); it comes with miso soup, beef sukiyaki bibimbap, gyu-sushi, kimchi, salad, prime kalbi short rib, skirt steak, filet mignon, ribeye, pork belly, garlic shrimp and broccoli with cheese. Sounds like a lot right? I mean...kinda in that it's a lot of different items but the portions are not that big when it came to the amount of meat that is given. Don't expect to get a pile of meat for each of the bbq items. It's enough if you're a small eater but for my boyfriend and I, we always order MORE food items on the sides, like (our favorite) the spicy tuna volcano, takoyaki, the tuna poke nachos...w/e we are feeling that day. Anyways, the meats are pretty good and tender. You wouldn't ever get served any distasteful ones. My fave bbq meat items were the harami skirt steak and kalbi short rib since they are marinated in sweet soy or miso. So they are very flavorful and would pair great with some plain white rice. But they have brown rice you can order OR have the sukiyaki bibimbap that you get with the chef's favorite. The items always come in a timely manner and the waiters would always let you know exactly how long to cook each meat for. You better listen to if you want the meat to be cooked well...unless you like it burnt and overcooked. ( To each his own tho...). The waiters are always attentive and you can always ask them for assistance. The reason I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 is due to the location. I noticed that each location is a little different. Not sure if it's just me (and my boyfriend) but we noticed in some locations the portion looks a little big smaller?  We are fatasses so maybe we are complaining too much lol . Another thing is that you don't have to worry about smelling like you were sitting in a BBQ place the whole day. They have a system that you do not smell once you enjoyed your meal!! This is great cause like yeah I like BBQ as much as the next person but...I don't want to smell like BBQ...on my way home...on the public transportation! esp. my hair"

This location used to be a hot pot place until they closed and this Vietnamese place took it over during the pandemic. Being fairly new, this spot is clean and modern looking. It is very spacious too and perfect for a group gathering. In terms of the food, we were more than satisfied.We ordered several plates of pork with rice vermicelli (bun thit nuong). This was a big hit for all of us and what I would recommend the most. The meat was extremely juicy and seasoned perfectly. He had one bowl of pho as well. The broth tasted fine and did not seem bland as some others are saying. The only thing that was disappointing for us were their spring rolls. They were too small and lacking in flavor.Everything is reasonably priced too with most dishes being around 9 or 10 dollars."

I stumbled upon this place with a friend after walking around aimlessly trying to settle on a place to eat. What sold this place to her was the spinach dumplings. For me personally, I would've preferred to stick to a place that sells meat dishes but I figured why not?Upon entering, the atmosphere was weird. There was no music playing overhead. No noise from a TV or kitchen background noise. You could only hear the conversations the other customers here were engaging in. The hostess/waitress greeted us, asked to see our vaccination cards and took us to our table. Once at our table, I have a tendency to look at everything, on our table, on the walls, the customers, you know trying to take it all in. The place looked a tad dingy. The walls were covered in green paint/wallpaper. The carpet looked like it hadn't seen the vacuum or a nice clean in a while. I could've overlooked these factors until my fingers touched our table. I subconsciously decided to slide my finger on the table and I could tell it hadn't been cleaned in a while. It had this thick layer on the surface of something I can't even name. Although it felt dirty, nothing gross visibly appeared on my finger so I was relieved. I also decided to touch the plates and utensils on our table. They also felt like they hadn't been properly washed. The menu is of course vegetarian. They do however, offer some mock meat dishes but I decided to not risk my chances with those dishes. My friend ordered the spinach dumplings and a vegetarian wonton soup. The spinach dumplings were terrible. The doughy exterior was thick and tasteless. Although I didn't get to taste the wonton soup. My friend enjoyed it more than the dumplings. I had the pan fried noodles with broccoli. That was delicious. I was glad that it turned out great.Putting the vegetarian menu aside, I wouldn't really come back here or recommend. There are other places that sell meat and veggie options.

Very clean and timely and the staff are nice! Honestly the sushi platters are pretty worth it. Can feed 4 people on a platter and it's all well made. Rice to sashimi ratio is perfect and they don't skimp out on the fish. Their platter menus don't allow for customization so what you see is what you get-- unless maybe you have a certain allergy? Not sure-- I luckily don't have many allergies. I know it's super hard to find the menu online and every time I take the menu home I seem to lose it or have someone throw it out. So attached to this review is an HD menu for the time being. It's been last updated in July 2021. Thought I'd come out and support a small Asian business I loved with a small gesture lol. Enjoy the menu!"

I'm only talking about their baguette as this is all I tried along with an okay coffee.The baguette was similar to baguettes one buys from supermarkets. It was not crunchy on the outside. Inside was a doughy mess. Flavorless. As I chewed it felt as it were falling apart in my mouth. I had only taken a piece of the baguette - so I took the remaining almost full $4.00 baguette and threw it in the garbage. I thought about taking it home and toasting it to see if that would help but I was too disappointed.This is a basically a wholesale factory with a storefront.

The bagels smelled good as I waited and the store appeared clean and well maintained. The coffee, when I finally ordered and got it, was good.Speedy customer service needs improvement."

However, despite that once you get to the cashier they are usually so welcoming and enthusiastic that you or just me immediately forget the line was an issue. You place your order at one end of the counter and at the other end you order any pastries and/coffee and then pay. Very different system of paying and it takes a bit to make great food definitely worth the wait."

The establishment has amazing branding and the music slaps. The servers seem chill and it's a good vibe. We order the Sandwich, fries, and a Salad with some Spicy Hawawshi and Hibiscus Beetroot Tahina. I didn't taste much difference between the sauces which was disappointing. The sandwiches are a good size for one and the salad was big enough for us to have some leftovers even if I was really hungry. The fries didn't feel that especially but were a good compliment to everything else. I would like to point out that most orders were for takeout which might be the reason for the seats and tables not being that clean. Overall it's a good place to order delivery from or grab it to go."

Service was top-notch and I appreciated that there was a friendly sommelier in-house to help my inexperienced self choose a wine for the dinner. We asked the waiter about whether she preferred the famous trofie nero pasta or the spaghetti because my boyfriend and I were torn, and she said it's pretty 50/50 across the staff. She preferred the spaghetti, so I made sure to steal some of my boyfriend's when he ordered it. I can see why the trofie nero is popular. While it's not going to fill you up completely, it's a satisfactory portion and cooked beautifully. You will be able to taste all the scallops and seafood flavor, and the small crumbles on top added such a nice textural element. BUT... I think the spaghetti was the winner for me. It was such a unique dish that balanced the clean, tomato flavor with creaminess of the roe and crab. The spicy kick to the pasta was so memorable and what made this yummy dish unique. I would come back just to eat this again. This dish + the lobster soup appetizer was simply chef's kiss. Yet another amazing Michelin star experience in NY!"

We chose this restaurant after a day at the Met bc we were looking for a nice French experience and it looked cute in the pictures.  It wasn't that great.  The food was under salted and average, and more importantly to us, the staff and kitchen absolutely did NOT know how to handle a basic food allergy situation (We dine out a LOT and have literally never had so many problems.)  We told the waitress that my young-adult daughter is allergic to nuts and she said she would make sure there were no nuts in our food.  Not only did she not do that but there were hidden nuts in literally everything:  Pesto in the mushroom tartine that we asked for without the accompanying walnut salad so it would be nut free (and were assured it would not have nuts). Pesto in the escargot (?) (We've eaten escargot all over France and never experienced this). Nuts on the caesar salad (??) which they did manage to successfully remove.  Pine nuts in the spinach that was served with the sweetbreads, again not disclosed on the menu and the server denied that they were there.  Nuts on the asian eggplant which my daughter ordered (the kitchen realized this one at the last second and took it back and made it again). Just overall a total disaster, course after course.  By the time they re-made the eggplant and brought it out we were so uncomfortable my daughter didn't want to eat it (not to mention that it was unappetizing with half a head of iceberg lettuce sitting on top drizzled with orange sauce.)  When I mentioned how disappointing and stressful this whole thing was to the hostess she seemed shocked and then the waitress came over and repeatedly told me she had ""done her best."" To the restaurant's credit after I returned to my table they talked to their manager and comped our meal.  Overall, though, it was very disappointing.  More-so than a free meal we were looking to have a nice experience together and it was mostly derailed by the constant scrutiny and worry over the food plus the fact that we had to add salt to every dish to mask the blandness and really just did not enjoy it.  As an aside, the outside hut was cute but from where I was sitting I was looking out the hut's window at a large pile of garbage and recycling they had accumulated there and had to pull the little curtain closed to have some semblance of a nice ambiance. We would not go back or recommend this restaurant."

There are only two disappointments: the food and the price.This is located at an expensive place and the dining environment is good, so the expensive price can be justified. The food here tasted far away from what their name 小杨生煎 would suggest.  The meat in the noodles and the baos tasted a hint of vinegar, reminding me of my childhood in Northern China: when we had to cook non-fresh meat, instead of throwing them away, we used vinegar to cover the bad odors.  The soup of the noodles lacked the umami taste, and was too salty.  The meat ball inside the bao was too tight and tasted off.  The sauce for the bao was also a mystery.I would recommend this place if you need to have a generic upscale (meaning expensive) meal without expecting to have Shanghai food, or if you have no idea what Shanghai food should taste like anyway."
10821,2207,i6UIu3QC2aESANgOR9aycA,2022-01-22,4 star rating,"Great spot for a variety of authentic Shanghainese dishes in a clean, open space. I came for dinner and tried 4 different dishes: 1. Roast pork bun ($7.50)- This was a large bun with a savory filling of pork and onions, and the bun itself was nice and fluffy. 2. Steamed shrimp crystal dumplings (4 for $8.50)- Classic dim sum option, which did not disappoint. 3. Braised meat ball noodle soup ($19)- Noodles were cooked well and the soup was flavorful; meat balls were large and tasty. 4. Egg tarts (2 for $8.50)- Had to order this classic delicious treat; this one was a bit more egg-forward rather than custard-tasting compared to others, but still very good. As a whole, I'd say the prices were a bit high, but still somewhat reasonable.The restaurant interior is quite large and very clean. It also has some elegant decor with a casual atmosphere. I came on a Friday night, and there were only a few other people dining in. The owner was the one who seated us and took our order, and he seemed friendly.Overall, I would recommend Baodega if you are looking for high quality Chinese food (especially if you're looking for Shanghainese food) in a nice setting. Compared to other Shanghainese places outside of Manhattan (like in Flushing), Baodega might be a little pricier (still quite affordable though), but as a result, you can dine in a quieter, cleaner setting without the typical hustle-and-bustle surrounding you."

I came with my friend for Restaurant Week and had an amazing time. We started off with Salmone with beets. I loved it. We split the Risotto and Tagliatelle. Both were delicious, but I'm definitely coming back for the Risotto. Next, we had chicken and fish. It was also really good. For dessert, we had the Cioccolato, Tiramisu, and yogurt with sorbet.The service here was impeccable. Everything was on point. No empty water glasses, clean silverware for each course, and I really didn't have to ask for anything--even directions to the bathroom. Michael saw me looking around and before I could ask, he already assisted me. My napkin was folded each time. I just have to say it feels good to be back and feel this in NYC. Michael did a phenomenal job at giving us a great first experience at Armani Ristorante. It was such a great experience overall."

Loved the drink though, didn't know mezcal and passion fruit makes a great pair.We ordered lobster dumplings as appetizers. $22 for three pieces is pretty steep but the dumplings are of superior quality, melt in the mouth texture and delicious. I wish we could have stayed longer but then we had dinner reservations elsewhere. This place is so eye catching that it definitely deserves a revisit."

We had made a reservation, but in an empty restaurant indoors there were only two tables they could offer us, that appeared clean and had cutlery, ""or sit at the bar"" they said. Um, hmm...They were out of stuff and told us after we already ordered. They served the steak with a large mound of rice instead of fries. Wat. Yuck. I guess some Chinese dishes have this combination, but it certainly didn't work at Bozu, and it certainly didn't work if you were expecting fries.The sushi bombs are great, I really do think it's some of the best sushi around, but my entree arrived like 20 minutes after my partner's steak. They said, para-phrasing here but also not really, ""we have a large party in the back and we're giving most of our attention to them."" My partner rolled his eyes. He runs a Michelin starred restaurant and told me, a bit irritated, that any restaurant should know to start with the smaller table first. And honestly, they should have comped something, but didn't. Oh, well, good sushi, but probably won't be back anytime soon, there's just too many other options."

14064,75,j4dGkqL-OK9YH8Sl2eOWEg,2022-07-07,4 star rating,"Towa is not a sushiya, although they do have some sushi/sashimi offerings. If you come here expecting sushi works, you're dumb and need to go home. Towa is what Japanese food actually tastes like in real Japanese homes, when overworked parents have no time to roll handmade sushi, so they, you know, cook food like every other culture. Towa is about homestyle Japanese comfort food, but through the Manhattan lens of slightly too high prices for slightly too small portions.- Umami Tomato: Not as umami as I would've liked, especially given that tomatoes have natural MSG. But the dashi jelly, chia seeds, and passion fruit pieces were refreshing, and it was nice that the entire thing was pre-sliced for our convenience.- Yasai Tempura: I wouldn't have chosen this myself, but my friend wanted vegetables (so she chose the deep fried kind?). We got avocado, okra, eggplant, pumpkin, lotus root, sweet potato, and shiitake mushroom in our platter.- Anago Katsu: One of the more unique items being that it's eel cutlet. Tasty but tiny. So, so tiny. Wish they'd given twice as much to justify the $25 price tag.- Nasu Dengaku: From the same friend who wanted vegetables. Forgettable grilled eggplant with surprisingly little flavor. The three kinds of miso were indeed colorful but had no taste.- Wagyu Ishiyaki: To quote Rihanna, ""This is what you came for"". Hear that sizzle and smell that beef? That's people cooking their thin slices of A5 wagyu beef on a hot stone. I love DIY hot stone grilling, and it's so hard to find in NYC these days. This was good, but again, too little. I could've done with at least 5 more slices of beef. The accompanying sauces (wasabi, yuzu kosho, miso, and soy) were a nice touch.- Seasonal Donabe: Undisputedly the star of the night. It takes 45 minutes to arrive, and girl, it's worth the wait! Traditional cooked rice in a clay pot with seasonal Japanese vegetables I rarely see even in Japanese restaurants (besides Kajitsu). The first bite instantly took me back to my childhood days eating the donabe made by my Japanese grandma. Don't expect a flavor bomb, here. Donabe is subtle, nourishing and comforting--just like grandma.- Sake Kasu Cheesecake: I love cheesecake as much as Kim Kardashian loves a selfie, and you can't come to a JP place and not have JP cheesecake. This one was decent but not the best--it tasted a bit burnt and the yuzu honey sauce was kind of overkill.Want to get your liquor on? The best bang for your buck is easily the $19 Sake Flight that lets you choose any 3 sakes from the list of 8 or so options (so get the most expensive ones, duh). And the pours are pretty generous too. Skip the B & R Highball.Service was the attentive, obsequious, sweet-toned service everyone associates with Japanese people. I'm not sure I'd schlep back to Towa exactly, but I also wouldn't be opposed if someone really wanted to go. I just wish there was a 10% discount I could apply to the bill to even out those high prices."

The real reason we'd been wanting to come here though was because of the Wagyu Ishiyaki ($38) aka the DIY steak grilling platter. It was such a unique experience! We grilled about 7 pieces of A5 wagyu on a hot stone and they were just deeelicious. As wagyu lovers we also had to get the Wagyu Tataki ($25) app. The truffle butter paired SO well and we scarfed that down in seconds. We then had the Seasonal Donabe ($34) which had oysters (I believe) and fresh seasonal vegetables. I liked the clean, light flavor the rice had, but it seemed a bit too bland for us. It actually would've paired very well with the grilled wagyu (rice on the side), but this dish came a lot later as it typically takes 45 min to make. After trying a bowl, we decided to pack the rest of it home and not overfill ourselves with carbs. This claypot rice is probably best shared between ~4 people.Then we shared a Nigiri Set ($39) and the Uni Wagyu Maki ($38) - both were very good. Did I mention we are wagyu lovers? Can never get enough. I think the sleeper of the night, however, was the Ebi Mazemen ($25). I love a Japanese-style pasta dish done soo right. Unlike the rice dish, these were very tasty and flavorful carbs that we just devoured. The texture of the noodles was perfect.Finally, we ordered the Panna Cotta (hojicha flavored! $10) with our complimentary anniversary dessert. As non-dessert lovers we thought both were the perfect way to end the meal. We were very satisfied despite all the waiting in between each dish we ordered."

Gabriel was so sweet, super welcoming, and gave the best recommendations (he recommended the Oreo flavor to me!) This place is very clean to sit in as well and I can't stress enough how great the flavors are. There's everything you can think of: Hazlenut, tiramisu, Oreo, and caramel to name my favorites and so much more. STOP BY and ask for Gabriel!"

14776,787,ND97mueQmRiUKiN3HZ4vcA,2022-10-02,5 star rating,"I'm surprised to see no reviews for the amazing brunch - I've been a brunch regular for almost a year now. The food is consistently great, the decor/atmosphere is lovely and clean, and the staff are attentive and friendly. Bathroom is A+. Seating - weather permitting, sit in the window seats if you can. It's a nice space and great people watching. Note to restaurant: sometimes the music seems a bit unnecessarily loud for brunch. Also has adorable outside seating, just be careful crossing the bike lane. Food (Brunch) - Huevos Rancheros with Short Rib (also comes with their delicious yuca fries), Chilaquiles, and the breakfast sandwich are our favorites. YUCA FRIES. Drinks - Full bar with eight options for brunch cocktails included with the special I will mention below. If you even plan to order two drinks, the brunch special still saves you money.  Service - All the staff are nice and helpful, but Carlos is A+++++. Honestly, he is one of the reasons we keep returning to this spot for brunch. It's hard to find service like this in NYC. Details: Brunch on Sat/Sun is $39, which includes one of the breakfast entrees and ""unlimited"" drinks from the brunch menu (I think unlimited actually means 5). A couple of options are a few dollars extra, like adding short rib to the huevos. Margaritas are also included in the brunch cocktail options, though they aren't listed in that section on the menu. For some reason they don't advertise the brunch special on the website, in case you go looking."
14970,981,Kks8q-ASmES11UNpmJ82zA,2022-03-31,3 star rating,"Uh-oh. Guess I'm going against the grain among a sea of ""Zomg, my first Michelin-starred restaurant!!!!1"" and ""We celebrated our aNniVeRsAry here!!!!"" 5-star reviews.Ai Fiori was average at best. We did the four-course prix fixe and got the Tartare di Carne and Polipo to start; the Trofie Nero and Spaghetti for pasta; the Astice as both entrees; and the Torta di Limone and Cubetto di Cioccolato for dessert. To imbibe, we got the Royal Blush and the Rubies and Roses.In terms of technique, the dishes/drinks were all prepared, cooked and presented well. But nothing was particularly noteworthy, and some things like the Astice had me scratching my head. Why pair a succulent lobster tail, lentils and savory buerre sauce, with julienned apple drowning in sour vinaigrette? The vinaigrette was so pungent that I couldn't even enjoy the lobster and lentils because it kept seeping into that side of the plate--and the smell was awful.Where Ai Fiori really lost me was the service. Our server was nice but barely there. It took us 10 minutes of sitting at our table with no menus before she even appeared. And trying to flag her just to get the bill was a 20-min exercise in frustrating futility. I know restaurants are struggling with service issues right now, but there were so many staff milling around that I don't think this particular case was due to to a lack of personnel. It just seemed like poor organization.Clientele is a mix of old white men who look like extras on Billions, trustafarians, trendy couples, and botoxed ladies who look like extras on Real Housewives.I've had better experiences at pasta restaurants with no Michelin stars. Ai Fiori was a letdown."

The spicy scallop rolls were overcooked, and since they were diced it was hard to taste the scallop flavor. The snowcrab avocado tasted clean and had good texture.We also ordered the salmon teriyaki bento with side salad and crazy roll. It came with rice and orange slices. The lunch price was extremely affordable for the portion size. The salmon piece was thin and slightly overcooked, and the teriyaki sauce was a little salty. The crazy roll was large, and the salad was a standard green mix with house dressing. I would order the bento again, but with a different protein."

We did ask the restaurant for hot water so we could make tea (that we brought from home), but that was a little awkward.As for the room itself, the mattress was a bit too firm for me, not every room has a desk as advertised, and the wall of windows causes poor insulation (the room got way too hot when the sun was beating down through them, and then got way too cold when the sun went down and the howling wind picked up). We really appreciated that the hotel provided a sound machine in each room - not just to drown out the noisy wind, but also the street noise (garbage trucks in the middle of the night?), and the partying neighbors/hallway passersby. The casting feature on the TV made it very easy to sign-in and play a movie or show from any of our own streaming services, which was convenient and helpful. The open-layout shower without a door or curtain made for a very cold (heat escapes too easily to the high ceiling and right out the open doorway) and messy (water splashes EVERYWHERE) shower without any privacy (it really just needed one more row of frosted glass for the average-height person).All of that said, we loved the live jazz music in the lobby/bar area, enjoyed the beautiful architecture and decoration, and the views are amazing, especially from the night club inside an old water tower on the top floor! We visited in winter, so couldn't enjoy the rooftop pool, but I'm sure that's great as well. (visited 1/8/22)"

Everyone was excited to get one but very disappointing.  2 ladies had Mont Blanc aux marrons which was disappointing.  A good Mon tblanc tastes delicate and real marrons such as chest nuts.  I had 3 bites and it was nothing like the one I loved at Angelina Paris and Ginza Tokyo Japan. A waste of money. I had a cake with a red leaf decoration and white shreddered chocolate tasting like a fridge.  It was disgusting as I could tell the white chocolate is not fresh and absorbed the fridge taste(smell) as if I was eating a refrigerator.  I ate a few bites and could not finish.  I suggested I could bring them back to the store but the lady who bought them said she didn't want to go back as the store girls were arrogant.  I stopped by the shop to speak with a manager who was nice but I could tell the girls behind of the showcase are not sweetest as selling sweet, delicate bread and pastries.  $12 per cake. The coffee shop is chic and packed always.  It is sad that they sell cakes like these."

I had high expectations, which were not quite fully met. (I grew up in Singapore; flavors used in both and Indonesian cuisines are very similar so my base reference is very specific.) Restaurant decor was interesting and is ""kampung chic"". We arrived at around 5 on a Thursday afternoon so it was empty. There were signs on every table to to ""clear your own table"" and a bussing station/bins for diners to leave their dirty dishes. There were napkins and cutlery were on each table as well, much like some kopitiams are set up. We ordered nasi lemak, char kway teow, fishball noodles soup, belacan wings, lobak, and otak otak. The nasi lemak portion looked small but it was just nice. The nasi was lightly coconutty but it wasn't piping hot; the ikan bilis and peanuts were seasoned perfectly but not crispy or crunchy. The sambal on the side was really good but they gave a tiny portion, and additional sambal was an extra charge. The char kway teow had a nice wok hei flavor and it was cooked to order which was nice, but it was a small portion for the price. I only had a bite to sample since it's the hubby's dish. He liked it but thought it was over priced. Both hubby and kid liked the belacan wings. The lobak looked good but was dry and a tad bland. The kid's fishball noodles soup was bland. The otak had the right texture but it could use more umami. Overall, it was OK for me. Good enough to satisfy cravings that cannot be satisfied in Honolulu."

The menu is pretty big and the food looks promising. However, it just did not deliver. The chicken was kind of cold, tasted a little old, and lacked flavor. It was missing the key elements of a good chicken tender. The chicken and fries were also extremely oily, which wasn't my favorite. The slaw was in a tiny container, but it was ok, because i didn't like it at all. I did also get a Buffalo chicken dog, that was probably the best thing. The milkshakes were good. The loaded fries were probably the best because the bacon tasted so good. Thoroughly disappointed thought.The service was great though. The cashier was so knowledgeable and friendly."

Even with such a large group, all of the dishes came out at the same time and very quickly after ordering which was impressive!  The menu is large so there are definitely options for everyone and all tastes.The summer rolls ($7) were somewhat loosely rolled and messily plated so they did not hold up well when eating.  The rolls were mostly fresh vegetables with a few mini shrimp in them.The pad woon sen with chicken was, again, not plated well but it had a good sized portion of chicken and was overall a filling portion size.  The dinner meal was only $13 which makes this restaurant a great and affordable spot."
17114,649,wT_-RVwMoiPAL9L191Zjvg,2022-07-09,4 star rating,"3 stars.  +1 for not sitting indoor parties right next to each other if empty tables were available. We made a reservation for 8:15, and we're seated almost immediately despite coming a few minutes late.Small little place, the indoor area was pretty cold, and the windows were open to the outside so the ac and the breeze outside were all kicking in. The lighting in the table is intimate. Dim lighting, small lamp bright enough to read the menu but not bright enough to see the stains on your bf's shirt. We got the carbonara, gnocchi alla sorrentina with chicken, and the Pomodoro bruschetta. I found the portion size to be quite small for $18 entrées. After finishing the appetizer and the entrée, I felt mildly(?) full and I'm petite! The size of carbonara was like a double ice cream scoop, easily devour-able. Strong flavors in both entrees. We liked the bruschetta! Toasted and extra crunchy, with a side of bread (not toasted). The sangria was alright, I liked it - more on the sour side and not too strong. The tables were pretty small, I felt like I was going to knock the pitcher of water over and there was barely enough room to put anything more than 1 dish on the table. The bellboy/waiters kept coming by to take our dishes away (almost immediately) once we finished. Food did feel like it took some time to come, but it was super hot when it arrived. A party of 2 came in around 8:50pm-ish and they didn't make reservations. They were easily able to grab a spot, many tables open."

They had staff maintaining the cleanliness inside and out, making it inviting as we passed by. The pizza was so delicious (as Chicago pizza folks we almost didn't want to admit this!)! The sauce was so delicious, and made the pizza in a way that an ingredient can make or break things. The mozzarella was scrumptious. The freshness of the basil was a if it had been recently picked from a garden. The crust was perfect. We ate the entire pizza, plus a few garlic knots. Whether you're native to NY OR visiting, this is a good place to stop and grab a slice. Or a full box."

This level of self-importance would have been easily forgiven if the bowl had been great, but it was barely edible, and the reason why is...... salt. I don't know what happened in the kitchen that day, whether this was an aberration, or whether every Ivan-celebrator just reallllly likes salt. But I reallllly like salt most of the time, and it was about a thousand times too much for me. When they pickled the mustard greens and the wood ear mushrooms, is it possible they just poured the pickling water into my soup? It was medicinally salty, chemically so. I could smell it when they put the bowl down - I picked the bowl up to sniff it curiously before I even lifted a spoon to my mouth.If ratings were an average of how well each ingredient was prepared, Ivan would have done okay, actually. The pork was a perfect melt-in-your-mouth ring, the noodles firm and chewy, the egg delightfully orange and runny. But none of those things mattered because they all sat in the Great Salt Lake of Ramen."

We got the tonkatsu (garlic, umami, rich) and chicken paitan (Ivan's favorite, clean, homey) ramen. Definitely hit the spot given the paucity of thoughtfully created ramen dishes in our area (please feel free to prove me wrong)."

The bartender (brunette with bleached eyebrows) at the counter was a delight, she gave us recommendations and provided great service. We ordered:* Crispy Eggplant ($13)* Yuzu Lemonade ($4)* Ivan Palmer ($4)* Tonkotsu Ramen ($19)* Tokyo Shio Ramen (18)We spent a total of $63.16 - a little pricy but the food was delicious. The fried eggplants had a delicate crispy breading on the outside and had a silk like consistency on the inside. The drinks were tart and refreshing -- some might say they're not sweet at all compared to traditional lemonade and Arnold Palmers. The unsweetened barley tea is very prominent in the Ivan Palmer even when you mix it together but it was very good. It was a nice palate cleanser to cut through the richness of the ramen. I LOVED the broth of the Tonkotsu ramen. It is jam packed flavorful with tender pork and bits of mushroom. Tokyo Shio ramen had a very deep yet ""clean"" tasting broth. The tomato was a nice umami bomb which is an unusual topping but totally worked. Both bowls didn't look like a lot of food but we left feeling stuffed. The only thing we weren't too crazy about was their noodles. They were a bit lackluster and wished they were wavier for texture. Also they only have one dessert on their menu which is their Yuzu Cheesecake. But overall we had satisfying dinner."

This negative review is not for Paris Baguette here, is for the back Korean bookstore, I took a picture of, who treated me like crap!!! After I said sorry to her, she gave me a long face!! You not supposed to treat me that way!!! Last warning or I am filing the personnel complaint online. You are paid to treat customer nicely!!! Not yelling at customer like this because of this and that!!!Update later in March 17, 5:06 PM, while I am back home in Ridgewood Queens, I also know that is not totally the bookstore lady's fault; it is someone who blocked the Dyson hand dryer with the garbage can the reason why I could not dry my hands. So that is someone's fault to whom put the garbage can close to the Dyson hand dryer, that situation in Men's bathroom. That time I was going here for a visit only after my parents went to nearby Radiology which is just down one block.Anyway, this negative review is not for Paris Baguette; it is for the bookstore inside this cafe. And it is not totally the bookstore clerk fault; it is to someone who put the garbage can blocking the hand dryer in Mens restroom where I barely reached to use it; you know that garbage can put there is totally unsanitary! That is why I could not dry my hands after wash and made the bookstore clerk mad at me. This would have not happened to me if they manage the store more properly, including not blocking the hand dryer with something filthy, and something like that."

Nice and clean and the food all looked tempting. I got a mocha cake that was quite delicious. The best part was the little I'm gonna say cookie thing that was on top sticking out. It was a little softer I was expecting it to be crunchy and so that would've been nice to have the crunchy texture but it tasted fantastic little kitten on top is the best part about the cake. Good value overall."

Upon entering you go to the cash register to order or step to the side to view the options. The ording goes pretty smoothly, the cashiers seem to know how to work the machine quickly. They have the option to scan your code to get points for possible future drinks.  Ordering never takes more than 2 minutes if you know what you want. Depending in how busy it gets it can take about 5 min to 10-15min. The place is relatively clean but small. You may have to wait for your order outside but they do call your number in the speaker when its ready. 5/5 will continue to return"

The location of this restaurant is interesting, nestled under the towering BQE bridge off of one of the busiest, grungiest (dare I say ugliest) roadway artery running through brooklyn. The interior is meant to reflect this vibe inside. Industrial, run down, grey and utilitarian. It's a perfect cross of Gowanus Brooklyn and forgotten Tokyo. It is almost deliberate, and I'm here for it. Diner style grey seating - cozy and practical yet also comfortable. I loved that we were served water in stainless steel cups - clean and anti microbial, while delivering the message ""this space belongs to the people"". My friend and I both ordered the spicy gyukotsu ramen. The only condiment on the table was red chili powder. Perfect, because it is all I require. Food came out relatively quickly. A perfectly seared piece of short rib was on the Ramen bowl. It was fatty, it was meaty, and it was ABSOLUTE PERFECTION. The broth was a perfect temperature, the flavors perfectly balanced and layered - creamy?  umami?  savory? Complex? Corn added exciting texture and substance, the spicy chili oil added a little bit of sexy slick. The noodles were slippery and wavy, like a beautiful canvas forming the perfect background. This is one of the best Ramen bowls I've had in a while. What makes this restaurant amazing is not just the quality of the food but the experience. I felt like I walked in to a local spot in a forgotten neighborhood in Tokyo after a long rainy day of hard manual labor. The ramen hugged me like a mother. Comfort at it's finest. Please go here."

Za-Ya is one of the top, if not the top, ramen spot in Brooklyn and we were excited to try. I was intrigued by their beef broth ramen, as I've only had tonkatsu and vegan/vegetarian ramen.The interior is cozy and clean, with only a handful of tables. We were greeted upon arrival and thankfully there was an open table! We both ordered the Gyokatsu ramen, which is their signature dish. Service was attentive, kind, and fast. Before we knew it, our ramen was delivered to our table and we dug in! For the price, the portion is generous. I thought the beef cuts in the ramen were delicious and took the bowl to the next level. The ramen noodles were chewy and plentiful. The broth was definitely flavorful, but not as flavorful as I initially expected and I did not find it to pack the same punch as pork-based ramen. The upside here is that it left me feeling pleasantly full without the post-ramen sleepiness I usually get with heavier, richer broths.Za-Ya is definitely worth trying and I would come back to try the spicy gyokatsu ramen!"

As others have pointed out, the food portions are small and the staff seem unhappy. The day that I visited, I arrived shortly after the store opened but the food was not yet ready to be served. I witness one girl doing all the set-up work while two others sat at tables eating. (Head nod to Ashely C.'s 1/17/23 comment that ""the entire staff was on break eating food like it was a Christmas party"". LOL) While Chipotle may allow workers free plates before the start of business hours, once the front door is open, the goal should be customer service/ revenue generation. The kicker? My bill for 3 skinny tacos was almost $19. Fun fact - if you ask for queso blano on your tacos it is considered a 'side' and priced at $2.95. I learned that at the register. The tacos were tasty, however, and place was clean. Maybe next time I will accept that big ole scoop of rice offered as my tacos' base. Less likely to leave hungry."

Once home, I noticed I only received 2 small rice crackers to go with my hummus (which I guess is standard, but still small) and that the hummus had a bizarre smell and texture to it. Once I finally tried it, I threw it into the trash immediately. It had the most chemical and medicinal taste that was repulsive, I cannot even believe they would serve this especially for $9. The chili sin carne also had a bizarre smell to it, I can't even begin to describe. It smelled waxy and like I opened a can of chef Boyardee from the '90s.

Very cozy bake shop that has extended and outdoor seating towards the back. Staff are very cordial and warm. Space is clean and brightly lit. Alot of local patrons. I got a breakfast sandwich (slightly greasy sourdough) but the fixings are amazing!!! They don't skimp on the avocado, are light on the bacon (how I like it), and they have halved boiled eggs which are warm and soft. If you dine in, slather on the hotsauce and ketchup! They have condiments in a large tray, self-serve  iced water, napkins, etc. I also got a blueberry danish. Danishes are usually not my thing but it was just so tempting! The bread is flaky like a croissant, very fresh! And the blueberry preserve is only slightly sweet so the berries themselves are at the forefront, flavorwise. Very easily shared with another person.I was really tempted by alot of the pastries - pasteis de nata (a staff favorite, filled with a vanilla custard that isn't too egg-y or sweet), the kouign aman, the CHOCOLATE BABKA!, and the poached egg and sliced pork belly pastry cup. I missed out on getting that pulled pork sandwich too!!!! I will have to come back again since I'm staying in the area. Prices for the pastries are very reasonable. Sandwich prices are slightly on the higher end. I also did not take advantage of their seasonal drinks but I definitely need to try the London Fog and Spiced Pumpkin Latte (so happy they have this off-season....would I still be considered basic??

This West Village Sweetgreen location was open with modified holiday hours. This is a clean, well-organized Sweetgreen location with shelves at the front for easy pick-up; they also have a board that lists where the ingredients are sourced from. I love their warm Harvest bowl, which has the perfect salty/sweet flavor profile with goat cheese, almonds, roasted sweet potatoes, and apples. The salad had a generous serving of tender, juicy chicken. The rest of the salad seemed to be smaller than I remembered -- maybe Sweetgreen locations are cutting back given inflation. I also requested light dressing, and unfortunately it was overdressed. I reached out to customer service about the portion size and dressing, and they were kind enough to compensate for the experience. A+ for Sweetgreen customer service."

I came in around 10 PM to get a slice with my friend, and got the Tiramisu slice which was advertised as having a cream cheese frosting. You'd think it'd be tangy and fluffy especially to imitate the mascarpone whipped topping tiramisu has, but the frosting was THICK and so so aggressively sweet, I thought it was buttercream. The coffee soak also didn't permeate the layers of the cake well, so it was incredibly dry and crumbly without any frosting. I asked the people working if it was cream cheese, and they said that it was. I said it didn't taste like it (or even remotely balanced or good) and I got the slice solely for that since I don't care for buttercream. They then tasted the cake on their own and said that it indeed was cream cheese frosting and that ""different bakers have different recipes/ratios for the cakes"" so it was sweeter than usual. Wtf? Talk about quality control...I just stood there awkwardly, but no one offered any solution or offered a replacement slice, which I thought was very odd. I would have asked myself but they all seemed very over it & like they didn't care so nothing would have happened anyways. It was especially disappointing considering their slices are like $8-9. That's NOT cheap. I ended up giving a slab of the ""cream cheese"" icing to my friend since her strawberry shortcake slice had virtually no icing and was dry, and I threw the rest of my slice in the trash. I'd recommend Brooklyn Cupcake or Sweets For The Sweeties 10000x over Little Cupcake Bakeshop if you're looking for a cupcake spot in BK to support.

Their cakes and other baked goods are fresh and satisfying. The one drawback is that while they give out huge slices of cake, they're not cheap. If you come here, just expect to pay more than $7 for any dessert. I personally think it's worth it, but if you're looking for a cheap dessert, this is not it. They do have lots of tasty flavors though. I can't imagine anyone NOT finding something they'd enjoy here. Considering the serving sizes are so large and deserts are so rich here I think I could only come by with a group, but it's still a fun place! Oh and it smells wonderful, as expected from a bakery."

Bought a chicken meal.  A couple of hours later I had to make a b- line for the bathroom. Felt like I was going to vomit but had diarrhea. Day two, all diarrhea. I should've gone with my instincts because when I looked into the franchise from the drive through window, there was trash all over the floor.  The two dudes working the shift seemed sketchy cause they were talking and the guy who took my order kept looking at me for some reason.

This place was so good that we came twice in the short amount of days we were In New York. A few items of note that I highly recommend are the spaghetti and meatballs or the lasagna. As afar as appetizers go, get yourself some garlic twist. I found myself eating almost all of them after dipping it in the sauce. Lastly, I wanted to mention the pizza here is top notch, I had four slices of an entire pizza when I was supposed to share. The atmosphere here is super festive. They had music playing the first night we came in. Our second visit, they had game night with board games and beer pong going on. This spot is so well known some sanitary guys parked their truck outside to order some pizza. Service was great and friendly. I highly recommend this spot, overall amazing experience."

The design is strikingly unique, a timeless aesthetic that evokes a sense of place - perhaps Finland, or someplace similarly distant. And yet, despite these undeniable merits, the restaurant's reputation remains tainted.The problem lies not with the restaurant itself, but rather with the terminology used to describe its location. The term ""Dimes Square"" - applied to a small cluster of businesses scattered throughout Chinatown - leaves a sour taste in one's mouth. It feels disingenuous, a cynical ploy to attract customers in search of the latest hipster hotspot.But the issue runs deeper than mere marketing tactics. The term ""Dimes Square"" carries with it an association with a broader social and political movement, one that promotes a reactionary and exclusionary worldview. The very notion of elitist service in lower Manhattan feels like an extension of this movement, a manifestation of the pro-racism, homophobia, and transphobia that characterizes it.And yet, in spite of these concerns, the people who work at the restaurant are unfailingly pleasant and genuine. They are simply doing their job, providing an exceptional dining experience to their customers. It is not their fault that the term ""Dimes Square"" has been co-opted by unsavory elements, nor are they in a position to distance themselves from it.In the end, the decision of whether or not to patronize the restaurant is a deeply personal one, rooted in individual values and beliefs. But regardless of one's choice, it is crucial to acknowledge the complexity of the situation and to approach it with nuance and sensitivity."

Now still busy as they have online platforms and online ordering. I ordered online as I walked and placed my order. The Cashier was very nice and helped me find my order and retrieve my free guacamole and queso. The gentleman was busy but helped me by making my order to meet its pick up time. My order was delayed but honestly I think a DoorDash courier took it by mistake or for consumption from the shelf. So I did not mind the wait as the team helped me get my order as paid for.Space is the same, big and tables for groups and individual counters. Clean space and music was chill not loud or obnoxious as before. I do wish Chipotle had the option to press the burritos so they stay warmer for to go.

The focaccia bread for the sad which was fresh and had great sauce to top it offService: servers were attentive from moment we stepped in. Our water glasses were never empty. They checked in but weren't too annoying and did not awkwardly hover. They were friendly and cleared our table at the right time. All the food came out together.Ambiance: it's a small narrow place with an open kitchen. They played Spanish music in the background (a bit loudly). But it's a lively ambiance and environment with lots of chatter. The decor is clean and modern.Price: food for brunch was a tad bit over priced but they did have great quality ingredients so justifiableOverall I will come back to try regular weekday menu

I don't leave many reviews, but I just needed to share this. The chicken really did not taste, look, smell, or feel like chicken. It was rubbery, didn't pull apart like chicken, the bite just wasn't right, and something tasted off. I hate to say it but we thought maybe it was some other bird similar to a chicken, like a duck or something- I have zero clue. At first I tried saying that it was maybe the way it was the way it was cooked, but it was really just strange when I found a lump. Me and my boyfriend were equally as confused as to what this meat was. If there's any explanation for this I'd love to hear it, because what I received was not chicken."

But the reason I'm giving it 2 stars is not because of the food but my experience on my last visit (2/15). I sat at the bar and ordered a drink and when I got it I noticed that there was a ring at the bottom of the glass, I thought it would've been from when he poured the drink so I asked for paper napkins to clean the table and within a few minutes I saw a ring under my glass again so I thought that's quite strange, so I picked up the glass and when I did I CUT MY HAND!! The drink was leaking because the glass was CRACKED!!!! I told the waiter and he was sorry, but he didn't really do anything about it. After that happened, he disappeared and I got a new waiter who had no clue about what had happened. I asked for the Salmon Paradise and I never got my miso soup that is included with the meal. I later asked for my food to be boxed and when I got home there was no soy sauce when I specifically asked him to put packets of soy sauce in the to go bag. When I received the check, I was expecting that AT LEAST I'd get my drink as complimentary since I CUT MY HAND with their glass, but nope! Not even the drink!! Paid the entire check, had to sign it with my left hand because I couldn't even hold the pen with my right hand. So the place is fine, sushi is good (pricey but I guess it's ok for NYC) but my review is low ONLY because I wasn't expecting to go have dinner and end up getting injured. They should check their dishes after they clean them to make sure they're not a hazard for the customers."

I had a cup of cacao, the way it was intended to be drunk: dark and slightly bitter. I love dark chocolate, even 90 or 100%,  so it was a treat to have this in a warm liquid form.  No marshmallows and kid stuff in the cocao, it had a hint of cardamom (another fave of mine) and was topped with rose petals.

I love the open kitchen concept where you can see the kitchen and everything happening in the back. We got the shittake dumplings, cauliflower wings, Spicy mang sushi roll, Mushroom bao, and avocado cookie. Loved the dumplings and the cauliflower dipped in the sauces were definitely my favorite. I absolutely disliked the oyster mushroom bap, it gave very meaty texture and flavor/ smell. Really was not a fan we didnt eat it! Avocado cookie was definitely not the right texture of a cookie, i think they should call it a avocado matcha cake because it literally tasted like carrot cake and vanilla ice cream. Was delicious but i just dont think it can be labeled as a cookie!Will def return to try other options :) BTW the staff is incredibly nice!!"

The bar was semi full, but nothing overwhelming, and it still took 10-15 minutes each time I needed something. After I got my food I couldn't get the waitress's attention so I had to ask the patron next to me to pass the ketchup. This isn't a big deal but the patron seemed to be in a nice conversation and I interrupted her to get ketchup. She didn't mind but that's not the point; I shouldn't have had to do that. Anyways...The staff was nice when you could get their attention, but it was a test of patience to get some attention. It was kind of disappointing that they don't have many local options.   Being in what's supposed to be a ""progressive neighborhood"" you'd think they'd walk the walk, not just talk the talk and support the local economy by carrying more craft brews. The atmosphere was simple, clean, and open so you don't feel crowded. The saving grace here was the burger. I've tried hundreds of burgers and this burger left an impression. I can't pinpoint the herb/root/something that had a bite to it. It was fresh, a little strong, but not overwhelming. Not ginger or fennel or mustard greens; whatever it is, it rocked! I'd come back just for the burger! Awesome. Burger belongs on a wall of fame somewhere."

Personally that is not sterile and would rather have been given the spoon directly. We ordered one ramen, one egg and cheese sandwich and one sake drink, the total with tip was $60+ I would not go here again.

Service was quick and efficient.  Restroom was clean.  If you in the area , it a place to get good diner food."

They're rude and have a sense of entitlement. The supposed ""host"" who wears a black knitted cap, will clean up tables and ignore you just the same as the wait staff. They'll serve patrons who walk in AFTER you but not you until they feel like it.I get that this place is busy, but that's not an excuse to ignore customers. I've seen busier restaurants than this dump and the wait staff talks to you to let you know they see you. I blew up at one of the waiters last night, who I've seen before and have been waited on by before who had a shitty fkn attitude. Which one is he? The only one who wears a mask, so he's easily identifiable.  That one is a true p.o.s.I've been coming here for a long, long time and the attitudes were never this bad until the last 2 years. All the other reviews on here complaining about bad, awful service justify exactly my feelings. And it looks as if the manager of this place doesn't care. So Reggio, get bent."

I was personally exhausted by the limited amount of options if you want to eat healthy, so Over Greens is a god send. I have frequented a few times, and just yesterday visited and decided to leave a review for this great business. I ordered a protein smoothie, Ceasar salad wrap and the tomato soup. Everything was extremely fresh to order and the soup was delicious! Not acidic and very palatable. The service is great and the staff is friendly and takes their time. You have so many options here- make your own smoothie/juice/shake, build your own salad or buy their pre made options, make your own acai bowl. Tons of healthy beverages to chose from - coconut water, to kombucha and anything else you would generally see in a health food store. Amongst this strip of Emmons ave and sheepshead bay road, there are a few other health food stores which orient towards a similar style of food, but since this place is new and offers lots of more mix ins and customization, I honestly prefer it and think it's probably the best place in the neighborhood!! Highly recommend for anyone who is into sweetgreen or DIG and stores of the like! The inside is lovely as there is a gorgeous mural on the wall and it's exceptionally clean. Love it"

Everything was just right - the level of savory, sweet, spice, oil - it was all a perfect balance.  The service was also great. While I was waiting for my order, the staff was very friendly and accommodating, allowing me to sit by the bar area and even offering me water. The order was neatly packaged with nothing lacking. I'd asked to keep ingredients separated to avoid my meal getting soggy. They didn't skimp on ingredients, and they did a great job with keeping everything clean and tidy with no spills, which I really appreciate, especially when you've experienced messy take-out orders who use it as a chance to save a dollar or two.Coming from Elmhurst, Queens, where there's an abundance of great Thai restaurants, I was a bit skeptical at first when seeing the higher prices. In the end though, I do think it's worth it, and I'm looking forward to going again for a dine-in experience."

Fitrition is one of those places that look like it will be a fixture on Steinway Street for a long while. It is small, but clean and the atmosphere is very appealing. I can't describe what the vibe was exactly, but it was a super chill place. If the store is empty, there is seating in the window space that makes for a great cozy, yet casual afternoon date/outing with a friend. There is even art on the wall that is available for purchase which is a perfect touch to offer guests. I ordered the Queens Bowl and I was very impressed by the presentation and how fresh the ingredients were. Even the aesthetic of the several options offered was very pleasing to the eye and improved the ordering experience. If I am ever in the area, I would come back here if I am ever in the mood for an açaí bowl. Especially on a hot summer day, this is the perfect treat to have when running errands on Steinway."

I love that, I quickly found a seat in the back & put my things down and proceeded to the front to order. I ordered a mocha latte, regular milk. To my surprise, the vanilla was an add on, found at the milk counter; close to the garbage and napkins. This was my first time in this cafe, so the lack of menu cafe flavors definitely was a curve ball for me. Nonetheless, mocha latte it was. I was also curious as to why there's no in house cups, for people who don't grab and go, that was another first for me. The actual mocha latte, had a cute heart inside and usually I hate mocha lattes but, I loved this. The taste was so rich, and you can one hundred percent, taste the quality of the espresso. It didn't taste like drip coffee, with steamed milk like a lot of places. The quality was definitely present. Overal verdict: if you need a place to get some work done, you like mocha lattes and you don't care much about the extra cups, you just like the grab and go cups definitely visit here. If you want more of a 1 on 1 experience, with the nice cups and dimmer setting don't come here."

Now that my recent favorite has closed (the owner retired), I'm happy I've given Bagels & Co. another try. The quality is once again really good. The bagels are soft on the inside and harder on the outside, with only moderate chewiness. The one spread I tried was full of the olives it promised. The premises were clean, and although the line went out the door at 11 am on a Sunday, the staff was efficient, friendly, and there were enough of them to make the wait under 10 minutes. There is plentiful outdoor seating in addition to a large dining room and seats opposite the counter where the line is waiting. In addition, the other baked goods and Jewish delicacies seemed really well prepared, although I haven't had a chance to try them yet. Added bonus: 30 minutes after I left the store, the extra bagels I'd bought to have at home were still warm. It seems the bagels are $1.25 each and the bagel with olive spread was $3.80, all very fair prices for today."

It seemed tiny at first, but it was actually pretty filling. The biscuit was soft and buttery -- just how I like it! I also tried the banana bread and it was SO YUMMY! Moist and not too sweet!There is indoor dining and an enclosed outdoor seating area. We sat in both areas throughout our trip and both were kept pretty clean."

This way way before shake shack and bare burger on Austin. The business at cheeburger was busy every time we went back in the day. Today is different story, it's lifeless and depressing to see whenever we drive or walk by their storefront. Last Friday, after my son's piano lesson we decided to give it try since my son never tried it.Off the bat, my son seemed to really like the old 50's style decor and ambiance. He never seen anything like this in person other than watching it in movies. We ordered the couple's special. It comes with two serious burgers, best of both (fries and onion rings), 2 sodas w/ free refills, and a banana split for $34. We ordered my son their junior burger, included fries and a drink for $6-7. The burger was very juicy on a tasty brioche bun. The fries and onion rings were nice and crispy, and the Oreo banana split was great! When it came to the food and service, I have nothing to complain about during this visit.Verdict - Skip the pounder, the couple's special is a great deal. Service was great. The only complaint I have would be their restroom. It's quite filthy and in need of a renovation."

Noise was average but the volume was a little less by the bar I guess coz it was facing away from the rest of the crowd. Service was pleasant and efficient.We got our almond croissant first and it was one of the best that Ive had in a while - some crunch from crust and the almonds but soft in the center. And there is sweetness there too which I liked! The latte was very good and I also liked their Cafe Meil (has cinnamon). For the food we got the Jambon Cru which had nice soft scrambled eggs! I love the texture and the mild clean flavor of the eggs. Add with some pepper, prosciutto and parmesan and it was actually a lovely breakfast. The Belgian waffle was surprisingly good too! Fruits were fresh, waffle was soft and the creme fraiche actually elevated that flavor! The breakfast/brunch menu was really just something simple but I liked how they actually executed the whole dish and kept the flavor just so pleasant. Thats probably why I ended up giving the five stars after debating if it shouldve been a four. Anyway hubster agrees a 5 star is in order and so there you have it."

The interior is designed with a French theme, with menu items written in French and wine selections displayed on a mirror on the wall.We ordered an Americano and a dirty chai oat milk latte, both of which were satisfying. The main dishes we tried were the Croque Madame and Eggs with Smoked Salmon. The Croque Madame consisted of Gruyère cheese, classic ham, and a sunny side egg, while the Eggs with Smoked Salmon were served with eggs, capers, and salmon on a slice of bread.Although portion sizes were small, the quality of the food was good. The atmosphere was lively and bustling, but it could get noisy. Overall, Buvette is a charming and casual spot for brunch with a French twist."

I walk in, go to the bar, grab a couple beer + shots for my friend and I, then go sit down after checking the place out. We like it! We're talking about how cool/chill of a place it is and the nice atmosphere. As we're hanging out and talking (maybe 30 minutes), I notice people who work there keep coming back to where we're sitting checking for empty glasses. My thoughts are ""wow they're really attentive and keep the place clean"". They keep coming back it seems every 5 minutes so now I'm kind of confused. Next thing you know, a woman comes up to my friend and I and asks to look inside her bag. We're confused on what's going on so she grabs her bag and the woman is looking behind the booths and the corner where we're sitting. We're sitting in plain sight of the bar by the way (probably the most visible corner in the bar). The woman then says something about a deli bag and ""drinking pace"". She walks off and my friend and I are so confused. I explained to her what the woman said and we were really offended. When I asked the woman (the manager, she said she was) what the problem was, she told me that our drinking paces were slow and they were accusing me of drinking out of a deli bag or refilling my beer or something of the sort. I've never even thought to do something like that before.  While we're talking, she said ""we thought we saw a deli bag but there wasn't one.. unless it was thrown away"" STILL ACCUSING ME. Our drinking paces were ""slow"" but we just took a shot at the bar and were half a beer down in less than 30-40 minutes. It may be completely unrelated but I just happened to be the only black person in the bar. The manager and the bartender who accused me of this apologized but the whole situation was so ridiculous that I had to leave a review. This is how people are treated at this bar. Paying customers. If they thought such things, check the cameras before you accuse people who bought drinks and tipped. Crazy."

Also I would not recommend the eel bowl much. Too sweet.This is the local good poke spot. They also have sushi for relatively reasonable prices but I've never gotten it as I just prefer getting poke here. As noted by another reviewer, there's only a $2 difference between the two protein and three protein option which I am fine with as the crab (or rather surimi) salad is essentially just an add-on then. They also have an octopus salad to add-on which I am always worried about as cross-contamination would likely result in very bad times but luckily that hasn't happened and they are pretty clean inside. My only complaint is that I wish that there was an option like some other poke spots to specify how much of the sauce they put on (light/medium/heavy) as I would describe the sauce to be the ""light"" level from other spots so for people who love sauces, ask for extra on there. Most of their add-ons are also free which is a nice touch as some of the add-ons such as shiitake mushrooms are extra at other poke spots. I generally get tuna, salmon, and crab salad or yellow-tail with a mix of toppings and either the sriracha mayo or the yuzu sauce. Outside of the sauce issue, I would mostly compare this spot to Pokeworks outside of them not having sushi burritos (which I don't care and I don't think they should that anyway.) Similar quality fish. I've been here too many times to not rate them highly. They also have a nice slightly sweetened oolong tea tea brand (pretty positive it's a brand I have bought in Chinatown) for I believe three bucks."

Since it was my 1st time, i opted for the popular Ostmanthus Honey Oolong Tea for my husband (cold) and the Pudding Oolong Tea with Fresh Milk (hot) - both were so, so tasty and we actually ended up swapping on the ride home. Although i'm actually a huge fan of milk tea, i've never enjoyed it with boba - something about the tapioca texture tends to ruin the drinking experience for me. Nevertheless, i actually really enjoyed the oolong tea w/ the pudding as the pudding pieces were not intrusive and complimented the tea flavour really well.Overall - will def be back. It's a really cute, clean little shop, everyone was wearing masks and gloves, and the guy who took my order was really, really nice."

I have been going there every since the Chinatown one opened and when they opened the location in 8ave I was super excited because it's so close by me!  I love how all there drinks are always fresh and tasty! My top fave would be their hojicha latte ! Then comes their passion fruit green tea! Hojicha latte; 5/5: LOVEEE LOVE THEIR HOJICHA IT DOESNT DISAPPOINT!!  I love how it's fresh and it's not overly sweet and you can def taste the roasted green tea. I always get it 50% sugar and boba because it doesn't feel like you're drinking so much sugar and it just satisfies the cravings. I would highly recommend this drink! Tip; get it with boba ! Their boba isn't over cooked like how some boba shops are and it's just right!Passion fruit green tea; 5/5 as well!! It's super refreshing when you get it during the summer time and it's not sour at all. Passion fruit green tea also never disappoints~! It's my number one recommended refresher~! Service; 5/5; Everyone is super nice and attentive. They never delay your order and always makes it consistent. Ambience; 4/5; they always keep it clean and their decorations are always so cute. You will always have Ann opportunity to take a great photo since there are props. I just wished there were seats in this location though. Overall; 5/5; will always be a returning customer :)!

Highly recommend this-Plenta: Would pass on this - the smell was very off-putting for the majority of us and we were not a fan of the texture-Gamberetti: The shrimp was really good, the flavors went really well with the shrimp and the shrimp was perfectly cooked. -Fettuccine: This was just alright, nothing special. The pasta was perfectly cooked but the flavor was just alright -Linguine: Highly recommend this; the flavors were so good together. -For Dessert they gave us: tirasmisu, chocolate cake and panna cotta - the best one was tiramisu in my opinion.Overall cute spot for a date and the food was pretty good!"

I chose Laut Sigapora as the place to have my best friend's annual holiday dinner, and the food, service, and experience far exceeded my expectations. Laut Sigapora has charm and sophistication that can't be denied. It is clear from the elegant decor and artistic touches, and aromatic smells one can't help but imagine themselves being on the streets of Thailand or Singapore. Laut Sigapora got a lot right, but I was incredibly impressed with each flavorful dish. I was equally dazzled by the presentation of the food. I compliment the chef, staff, and management for bringing a taste of Asia to the East side of Manhattan. I can't wait for a return and try the spicy crab."

Then someone will escort you to the basement, where you will be stepping in a pile of spilled alcohol. Table is shared with multiple random people, where you will be forced to pay for 2 drinks per person, on the top of the ticket that you payed at the entrance. That would not be the problem if comedians were actually good and not students who are testing their skills, while you end up paying $100 for iced tomato sauce, dirty bathroom and sticky floor full of spilled beer. Giving only 2 stars because of the mustard guy lol who was really good, and the waitress who managed to juggle in between being on the stage and performing and then running down and serving drinks, otherwise would be 1 star.

Comedy historically is actually an important area of free speech and unless someone is just tearing into a certain group non-stop (and they themselves not part of said group) let them have a little artistic freedom to observe cultures and poke fun of ourselves. Some back and forth will happen between the audience and the comedians. The last time I came here a few weeks ago I was roasted by one comedian for being bald but I'm not interested in being offended. Having said all that - the drinks are pretty good they are not watered down. The actual venue can really use some TLC. I understand clubs can pass with a divey or more run down atmosphere but I think it's time for the staff here to do some basic things like replace some light bulbs and clean up (or replace) the set, replace some chairs, clean the floors etc etc. Overall I will keep coming back to this location and keep an eye out for new talent trying out their routines."

I threw most of the food in the garbage & contacted GrubHub about the food quality. Thankfully, GrubHub issued me a full refund.

Immediately upon walking in the smell of fried chicken and sweet waffles hit me in the face.They take your name down and seat you accordingly, but you can also order to go. I got the cinnamon roll to go and they heated it up. It was heavenly!Cinnamon roll: 9/10Warm, fluffy, sticky, and delicious! Definitely worth the splurge but you MUST get it heated up. The frosting was a tiny bit too cream cheesy, but that is the only negative aspect and it's not even so bad that the roll still tastes amazing.The staff is incredibly friendly too!"

Second, one of the best focaccia breads I've ever had. I don't know if it was the olive oil they used, the airiness of the slice I had, the perfect amount of sea salt or all of the above but I will dream of this focaccia for nights to come.You can see the workings of all the baked goods right behind the counter. The wall paper is just so cheery and there are several areas where you can sit and dine whether it be one of their baked goods or one of their Neapolitan pizzas. The second you walk in it just smells like a perfect combo of pizza and desserts. I ordered a mint tea and a delicious double chocolate chip. You can tell this was a fav in the neighborhood as people came in to meet up for a quick cup of coffee and a chance to catch up. Before leaving I purchased the following: fruit and nut baguette (the baby has already ate half the loaf...) an everything baguette (delish just sliced but can't wait to make avocado toast with it) and my slice of focaccia. So do yourself a favor and pop in here and try one of everything."

When I got inside the person at the register scanned the offer but didn't know how to apply it to my order. When another worker came to help they had to re-scan for the offer again. Because of this I was told that the offer was ineligible because they scanned the app twice. So I never got my free offer and didn't get anything except a ""it says it doesn't work anymore"". The customer service was terrible and the lack of knowledge the workers had of their own register shows how this establishment is truly run. Not to mention the cleanliness of the place was horrible. I will not be bringing my business here again and suggest others don't either"

The crust on the main pies are extremely thin making reheating a slice for crust lovers a terrible experience, not to mention most spots are pretty singed/burned already from the 'wood fire'2. The price point on these pies are a bit ridiculous. I have only tried the white pie, which comes w seasoned ricotta and caramelized onions w sesame seeds. I think the combo makes for an interesting one; however, I will say that after ordering at least 3 times, the sesame seeds creep down taking up almost a third of the slice leaving you with like 2/3 of the slice covered in toppings. I also wanted to add mushrooms ($5.50) and sausage ($7.50) to the pizza for a little razzle dazzle and I ended up spending $46.80 via UE. That is f**kin insane at almost $50.I also got a romaine salad and it was less than stellar and pretty sloppy overall. Lettuce looked kicked and wilted and shouldn't have been used to make the salad. The salad is super simple tbh and shouldn't cost $12 because it includes a few olives, 2 blistered tomatoes, red onion and a banana pepper. The first time I ordered, the meatball sub was missing. The restaurant said they included and tried to pin it on the UE driver, but I actually think that they forgot and did not take accountably. I def believed the UE driver. I ordered it again on a separate occasion and it was trash and overpriced @ $16.80. Minuscule spaghetti balls in a lackluster roll. The upcharge was most likely from the 'Pat LaFrieda' beef that it apparently includes, which honestly the quality didn't necessarily shine through. Tasted like conventional super market ground beef to me. Perhaps it wasn't seasoned particularly well? Idk, but I tossed it after 2 bites. Don't bother.Also given Jenny's mention below of a rando cockroach siting, (which many will say is typical for all NYC restaurants) i'm not to crazy about returning given their most recent health inspection rating (see photo)"

On more occasion, I have received completely different items than what was ordered, and the correction took longer than the original order.  Other times I can go through the line quickly and have a tasty lunch or dinner without a hitch. The food is still usually fresh and the staff is laid back so give it a try and cross your fingers for accuracy."

So the line moved unbelievably slowly - the worker was trying his best but there's only so much one person can do. I understand that hiring is probably pretty challenging right now, but the end result was a really disappointing experience.After ordering, we decided to sit down and eat in the restaurant. The tables were kind of dirty (nothing horrendous, though) and the quality of the food wasn't great (my steak didn't look or taste fresh). I can't imagine coming back to this Chipotle."

Namaste is a good place to eat and move on. The resturant itself is clean and cozy enough. Staff is friendly and attentive. We arrived around noon, we're immediately seated and offered the buffet or a menu to choose from. They weren't rushing us at all, but they weren't busy either. We went with the buffet cause it looked clean and had everything we wanted and gave us the opportunity to try some new stuff. Naan was extra and worth it, the Chicken Tikka Masala was ok (If you order it from the menu, you can apparently order white or dark meat directly for an extra dollar, wish I did that cause the white meat gets a little dry.)The chili chicken was the only thing they had spice to it. , Veggies where kinda delicious.

Tried a new dish a chicken curry that was fantastic flavor punctuated with mint and cilantro. Really delicious. For a $14 a person price this is a fantastic deal.

Pros The water pressure is better than my house. The best I've experienced in any hotel even ones that cost more. The hot water is hot. Real king sized beds w/ 5 pillows . Comfortable computer desk chair. Refrigerator in the room. Complimentary HOT breakfast EVERY MORNING. This was a god send. French toast, bacon, sausage, boiled & scrambled eggs, bagels, cream cheese/butter/jelly, toast, coffee, tea, apple & orange juice. Close to train, clean and the rooftop is open 24 hours. Great place to play cards, chat, read a book, eat or just relax.Cons  Wifi was very spotty, often didn't work. House keeping doesn't respect the ""do not disturb""sign. Not much place to put luggage. The room door needed to be slammed to close. I left my room door open for a day thinking it was closed. Bed was a little too hard for my taste.Checking in went off without a hitch and I got a great deal on booking.com. So it was definitely cheaper then other hotels in the area. I would stay again."

The staff was friendly, and the location was very easy to get in and out of the city. We went to Citi Field and Madison Square Garden and both were a short train ride. The WiFi also worked great.I also liked the breakfast which was included. It wasn't the fanciest breakfast, but it was free and the tables and preparation area looked very clean. Lastly, I loved the rooftop terrace (pictured). Really nice views of the skyline and we would hang out there for a few beverages. Would return if I'm in the city."

Didn't realize how close it was the Queensborough Bridge on ramp and the taxi depot. I'm not a light sleeper, but still had trouble sleeping both nights here. Since they were fully booked, couldn't change rooms. Likely would not stay again."

Loved the Pasta Carbonara, good portion for price under 10$. Has small wine options for dine  in and some beer. Great guy at the counter, very laid back and courteous. Space is small and clean, cute place for a stop when in the area. Def recommend."

The cashier and our waitress was really nice and super helpful. Of course I forgot to bring socks but I'm happy they had some available to purchase. There was a bit of a wait to bowl but by the time we ordered food at the table, our lane was available. We were able to start the game and bowl for about 2 rounds which is when our food came. The food was delicious!! And I was so happy because I was starving lol I ordered the special of the day which was blackened catfish that came with mash potatoes and collard greens. My date ordered something light (calamari) because he ate beforehand. I ended up eating his food too! Our bowling experience was also pleasant. The couches were comfortable, the venue was very clean. There was even a hand sanitizing station under the keypad which blew my mind! The only critique I would say is the music was not hitting the way I would have hoped. Also it was a tad bit cold so if you do go, make sure to bring a sweater! All in all, I would definitely recommend!"

We ordered a lot of food and finished almost all of it. They serve you steamed eggs and kimchi and a few other things on the house the moment you sit down. We ordered their Korean pancakes and wings for the appetizer and both were excellent! For the main course we offered their beef bulgogi, seafood soon tofu, cheeses fried rice, beef soon tofu, and fried rice. Everything tasted amazing, so much so that I have been craving for some Korean food ever since. We ordered their 3 different flavors of mocho ice cream, which they displayed it so beautifully with fresh strawberries and oranges. I didn't even like mocho ice cream before this and now I love it.I think the lady serving us was the owner of the restaurant. She was very pleasant and was always smiling and would fold her hands and bow down every time we compliment the meal or told her how great she is at her job. It is a decent size restaurant and was quite busy when we went. They keep the place very clean and their bowls and plates were nice, clean and hot."

The inside of the restaurant was small but clean and cute enough for a casual date. I ordered the tofu hot stone bowl and it was enough for dinner and some light leftovers. I like to let my bowl sit and cook for a bit longer so after 4-5 min the rice was super crispy. The spicy sauce was definitely needed to add some depth of flavor. The dish came with some banchan, including kimchi that wasn't very spicy, fish cakes, and vegetables. I didn't love the macaroni salad, it had little flavor. They also gave us a steamed egg on the house, which was super light and fluffy. They refilled everything except the steamed egg. I would come back, but the prices were a little high and what I would expect uptown, not in Chinatown."

I don't eat meat so I had the impossible burger which I am having mixed feelings not sure what it was the taste at first was good however the after taste it's tricky and I eat good so I know the service was amazing the cashier had phenomenal customer skills the ambiance was a bit dull there was an excessive amount of flies the floor was highly dirty the tables as well I get the whole reddish lightning system but it was not my cup of tea it was a quick bite for the night and it was not pleasing my children left food and that usually does not happen but ok I guess everyone's different I won't recommend on my end sorry

For some reason the workers there are usually very abrupt with their customers, especially on the phone. They're very short with you. Some people may be used to that sort of behavior but not me. When I come to an establishment to do business and give my hard earned money I expect respect. I gave them my order, and left to go pick up some dry cleaning. When I came back and got order; Mind you the whole time it was raining out, They hand me my shrimp rolls in brown paper bag. I asked for plastic bag, because it was raining outside. They completely ignored me. I had to ask a few times before they finally gave in and gave me one. When I got home...Guess what, There was only 2 shrimp rolls in the bag, when I clearly ordered and Paid for 3When I called them and tried to explain what happened the woman  acted like she didn't understand English. She pretended like she had No idea what I was talking about, and hung up on me. I called back. Another woman answers I explain again that they left out the third shrimp roll from my order. She then tells me to come pick it up. I told her its pouring down raining now. I'll come by later when the rain stops.  When the rain stops I go back there to pick up my shrimp roll. When I do I notice the girl goes to the back and brings it up to me.Now, it been over 2 hours, it probably had been sitting on  some  dusty shelf the whole time. On my way home I'm thinking should I eat this. Forget  about asking for my money back because,I know they would definitely give me a hard time.  So I didn't even bother asking. Plus I wouldn't be surprised if they did something to my shrimp roll I wouldn't put it past them. I  just took the L, and  when I got home I  threw the shrimp roll in garbage. I'm tired of giving these people second chances.Never Again Will I order From That Establishment."

I immediately threw out the sandwich and had to whip up something in my kitchen. A waste of money and time.

The inside of the restaurant smelled like disinfectant (not bad but not something I want to smell while eating) so we sat outside. The tacos are very well seasoned and very juicy  and these tortillas are STUFFED. The frozen margarita was average nothing to write home about. I will definitely be back for more tacos.

This is a party hotel. -super loud inside and out. Street noise, constant honking in the middle of the night. People staying next door to my room we're blasting music all night long. Impossible to sleep/relax. -shower is poorly designed; water gets everywhere outside the shower. Soaks the floor. -food is average. Had a few good meals. The Caesar salad had no flavor. Gnocchi was great. Pizza was good too. -service was non-existent. never saw anyone that worked there other than for room service. The lobby is on a different level than the entrance and there isn't anyone to greet you or help you out unless you go to another floor. -hotel is faux luxury. Looks nice at first glance but if you look closely, the paint is chipping, elevators are dirty, and things are starting to fall apart. Lastly- you can tell they don't care about customer service because if you read any negative reviews on yelp, the hotel manager is playing defense and arguing people's honest opinions. Never a good sign."

Rice did not come with any of the three main dishes we ordered where it always used to.The hot and sour soup was disgusting. It was worse than any we have ever had, watery, weak, all broth and no substance. The scallion pancake with beef was completely undercooked and tasteless. Also there was no hoisin sauce neither in the pancake nor on the side.The Hot sauce style chicken was all liquid. It used to be chock-full of tender chicken and it was delicious. While the taste was similar, the substance was completely inadequate. We asked for pork in scallion sauce and were told they no longer have pork, we ordered the beef. For $20 we received a small portion of eight pieces of beef with mostly onions and a few scallions.We routinely order crispy shredded beef from Bund so we decided to try it here. OMG. This beef was tiny shriveled hard fried pieces of an un-identifiable substance, tossed with dried hot pepper. No sauce. It was horrific and disgusting and also $20.The cold cucumber salad was delicious as always however for the price the portion has gotten much smaller. I will say the same for the pork soup dumplings, they were good. But arrived cold.Never again."

23018,659,HzmjJ1mM0WdOHbfYm5mxqw,2022-07-20,4 star rating,"Carnegie Pizza Ratings: 4/5Food: 4.25/5 - Pizza and donuts are always two of our favorite late night snacks to eat when my boyfriend and I are visiting NYC. I always walk pass Carnegie, and finally had the chance to try it out. The pizza is delicious, and tons of pies to choose from with a variety of toppings and sauces. See the description of the BBQ chicken pizza we got to share. - BBQ Chicken Pizza [GET]: The pizza crust is thin, chewy, yet still very crispy. It almost got a texture like a pita bread. Carnegie is not like others, the pizza is not greasy or heavy at all, instead tasted refreshing and light. The BBQ chicken is tender, juicy, and moist. I like the slight sweetness from the BBQ sauce, which combines nicely with the savory and saltiness from the cheese; it's a great combination. I really enjoyed it. Ambiance: 4/5 - Located right around the corner from Joe's Pizza, and close to most Broadway theaters and Time Square. The interior is pretty narrow and long, bright and clean, and you can see all the pizzas as soon as you walk in from the display containers. There's some tables in the back of the restaurants and some countertops for you to stand and eat. There's menu displaying on the big TV screens above, and I like how the wait is much shorter than Joe's. Price: 3.75/5 - The chicken pizza is $5.50, and got charged $5.99 at the store after tax. A couple days later, my credit card was actually charged $6.25, and no idea what is the extra charge was, but oh well, maybe they charge extra with AMEX credit cards. The pizza is solid, and prices are similar to the famous Joe's pizza down the street. Service: 4/5 - Walking in the store, staffs were welcoming and greeted us when we arrive. There's a good amount of staff working in the kitchen, and they were fast and efficient at heating up those slices. I got the pizza within like 5 minutes after I paid, hot and cheesy. It was great not having to wait for a long line for pizza, and the overall experience was smooth. BLUF: Definitely serving some delicious pizza in NYC. Great crust, fresh ingredients, and light. Even though this might not be a well-known pizza spots in the city, but it was delicious and gets the job done. If you are craving for a late night pizza, but do not want to stay in a long line, give Carnegie a try, a hidden gem in Times Square."

The staff was extremely nice and very gracious, having packed is plates and utensils before we were fully able to request them. They had staff maintaining the cleanliness inside and out, making it inviting as we passed by. The pizza was so delicious (as Chicago pizza folks we almost didn't want to admit this!)! The sauce was so delicious, and made the pizza in a way that an ingredient can make or break things. The mozzarella was scrumptious. The freshness of the basil was a if it had been recently picked from a garden. The crust was perfect. We ate the entire pizza, plus a few garlic knots. Whether you're native to NY OR visiting, this is a good place to stop and grab a slice. Or a full box."

The bartender (brunette with bleached eyebrows) at the counter was a delight, she gave us recommendations and provided great service. We ordered:* Crispy Eggplant ($13)* Yuzu Lemonade ($4)* Ivan Palmer ($4)* Tonkotsu Ramen ($19)* Tokyo Shio Ramen (18)We spent a total of $63.16 - a little pricy but the food was delicious. The fried eggplants had a delicate crispy breading on the outside and had a silk like consistency on the inside. The drinks were tart and refreshing -- some might say they're not sweet at all compared to traditional lemonade and Arnold Palmers. The unsweetened barley tea is very prominent in the Ivan Palmer even when you mix it together but it was very good. It was a nice palate cleanser to cut through the richness of the ramen. I LOVED the broth of the Tonkotsu ramen. It is jam packed flavorful with tender pork and bits of mushroom. Tokyo Shio ramen had a very deep yet ""clean"" tasting broth. The tomato was a nice umami bomb which is an unusual topping but totally worked. Both bowls didn't look like a lot of food but we left feeling stuffed. The only thing we weren't too crazy about was their noodles. They were a bit lackluster and wished they were wavier for texture. Also they only have one dessert on their menu which is their Yuzu Cheesecake. But overall we had satisfying dinner."

The staff and management have earned our trust through their use of high quality, fresh ingredients in their dishes. If you're the type to order breakfast at ten o'clock at night, this is the place for you. One of my preferred dishes at Buccaneer's is two over-easy eggs with fries and bacon. Let's go through this dish ingredient by ingredient. First off, their eggs are just right, a succulent yolk that screams fresh. There is no flavor profile contamination whatsoever. Simply wonderful.I've had some terrible experiences at other restaurants when ordering fries. They'll serve them soggy, oil-drenched, sometimes even over-fried to the point where the fry is semi-translucent. In an ideal world, a fry is warm (not scalding) when it reaches your mouth, has a soft crunch, and the texture of the potato and the surrounding salt combines to balance the natural blandness of the potato and enhance its own flavor. Buccaneer's fries does exactly that. They truly do set the golden standard for fries. The umami flavors found in the fries is further enhanced by their delectable bacon. Thinly sliced, lightly fried bacon is the perfect accompaniment to any of their meals. It dissolves the minute it touches your mouth resulting in an ecstatic experience.As always, it is worth noting that a restaurant is only as good as it's food and service. Gabriel has been a hard-working employee of the diner for many years and always goes above and beyond to enhance your dining experience. A special recognition to the rest of the staff for their amiable hospitality and care."

It's hard to get the salty/sweet balance down in a peanut butter cookie, and they totally nailed it!I also had the hot chocolate with oat milk.

The vast majority of the menu could be made gluten free and dishes that were fried (the wedges) were done in individual pans so there was no cross contamination. All were gluten free and fantastic!

Not only did the place REEK of mold, but they didn't have a stamp or paper bracelet system so that when my friend went to get a drink at the front bar (her tab was open there) and she headed back, they wouldn't let her back into the dance area. They treated her like a criminal, shining lights in her face, etc. and the bouncer put his hands all over her and made her feel very uncomfortable. She was just asking to get her stuff back from the dance area. They treated her terribly even though she did nothing wrong and they eventually ""86ed"" her. She wasn't the one who escalated the whole thing, it was all the bartender and the bouncers. I am NEVER going back there!"

The drinks are so very weak and so expensive. I get it, it's New York. But I asked for a dirty martini and the server said ""I don't think we can make it, let me ask"". A dirty martini is as simple as it gets. When she brought it back, it was just straight olive juice. Very little and not very notable liquor at all. I believe that could be the reason they don't like making those drinks...We also got the espresso martinis, literally all espresso. I finally resorted to a wine (after I returned the dirty martini) and got my husband a bottled beer. My wine was fine, his beer was not cold. LOL!Anyway, love this place, definitely recommend going.

The drinks are so very weak and so expensive. I get it, it's New York. But I asked for a dirty martini and the server said ""I don't think we can make it, let me ask"". A dirty martini is as simple as it gets. When she brought it back, it was just straight olive juice. Very little and not very notable liquor at all. I believe that could be the reason they don't like making those drinks...We also got the espresso martinis, literally all espresso. I finally resorted to a wine (after I returned the dirty martini) and got my husband a bottled beer. My wine was fine, his beer was not cold. LOL!Anyway, love this place, definitely recommend going. But I hope they can stop being so stingy on the drinks. People love going to Comedy Clubs for the drinks and to let loose!"

I had the tofu pad Thai, salad, and a mango bubble tea. The atmosphere is pretty decent, clean and spacious with modern neutral decor. It's a great place for a solo lunch date (not too crowded) and they have a backyard seating area as well in the front. My waitress was pretty attentive even though she was managing a  few tables and was gracious enough to bring me a bubble tea without whole milk in it after they brought me out one with whole milk. I will say though the bubble tea was extremely mediocre and watery. The bathroom was clean however it's didn't have a hook for my bag or coat and that proved to be challenging. Overall I do recommend this spot as it's a calm vibe, good food, and good prices for the lunch special."

The food was good, we were a group of 5 people and we all liked our plates. Now, the place itself looked kind of dirty, our reservation was at 4:30pm so they had just open after the break and I guess they didn't have enough time to pick up a few napkins that were on the floor. But the part that REALLY bothered me was the service! Our server had this face the entire time like he didn't like us or he was having a bad day, we would ask him for anything and he would almost roll his eyes. They added a 20% tip to our check so I guess the server really didn't care to give us a good service because he knew about it. Would I go back? NO. I'd rather have pizza or anything else anywhere else."

The only thing I don't love is that the back of the restaurant seems a little dark and closed in, so I always prefer to sit near the front. The food is great. My fiancé and I have a routine - we split the spring rolls (which are excellent.) He orders the pho, and I order the pork over vermicelli noodles. The spring rolls are as delicious as the should be and I take advantage of the lettuce and dipping sauces that come with it. There are no banh mis on weekends.... Can we bring that back?! Sometimes you just need a Sunday banh mi."

I was going to originally go to Pio Pio but someone recommended this place. Got there and was really feeling the vibe here, it has a unique look to it. After about 15 minutes was asked if they could take our order, drinks hadn't been ordered yet. Well we ordered a pitcher of chicha, and some appetizers. They bring you some spicy sauces with some roasted corn to munch on. I don't know maybe 8-10 pieces of corn between 2 adults and 2 kids seems super stingy to me. I asked for a bigger bowl once I got someone's attention and also placed our dinner orders. About ten minutes later we got the pitcher of chicha, still no corn, about another 10 mins after that we got the appetizers, and finally the corn, which now I don't need because I have my appetizers. Calamari was decent, sliced octopus 6 small thin slices for $20, and the anticuchos were far from what an anticucho is supposed to taste like. No flavor what's so ever, I would've enjoyed a Grays Papaya hot dog more. Less than a minute later here comes dinner. I turned to the waiter and said ""we just got our appetizers"" he took our food back. After we finished with our appetizers maybe 7-8 mins later someone finally brings our food out. My octopus dryer than my grandma, and she's been gone 3 and half years now. That's what happens when there's no communication and your food has to sit under a heat lamp for 20+ mins. The ceviche, seem like they add water to their lime because there was almost no acidity to it and an overwhelming ginger taste. My little one has devoured any and every ceviche. This was the first time she didn't want to eat it. 5 minutes later we were still waiting for my fiancées ceviche, the over confidant waiter never put the order in. It's cool to write down orders, I don't know what this new thing is of wait staff not writing orders down and then forgetting to put it in. You know what's not cool? FORGETTING ORDERS!!! I was still hungry and thinking if we order desert and it's trash like the rest of our food, it's going to be a total bust for this place. Luckily the tres leches, bread pudding, and alfajores were delicious!! Hence the 2 stars. I asked for the check while my girls went to wash up and use the bathroom before we left. Here comes insult to injury, chicha $15, + $5 because I said no ice. So they charge you an extra $5 because you don't want ice! Highway robbery. I was never handed a paper receipt, the waiter had already entered his 20% tip on the bill which wasn't stated anywhere. $220 for trash, I felt robbed. Avoid this place it's a let down, I've eaten at the worst places Lima has and it's still better than this place, Service and food wise! The only communication this place has is between the wait staff and the outside world, waitress texting on her cell while taking an order to a table, another waitress with the AirPods in her ear. Reminds of when I'm in the operating room and these over confident incompetent nurses are looking at their social media during a surgery. Theo or whomever is in charge truly needs to get this place running right. Surprised you survived a pandemic with the mediocre food you serve and the lackluster wait staff that you have. I should've gone to Pio Pio they never disappoint."

Maybe it was an off day, or maybe I've just been spoiled, but the rice was not balanced at all! The rice was overwhelmingly vinegar-ey and acidic, and totally washed out all the proteins, which themselves seemed fine. Very little wasabi between rice and protein. Soemtimes far too much salt and other bites had not enough. The consistently in size of fish/protein between myself and the other folks at the bar was huge. Staff behind the counter are nice. Server kept calling me sweetie in kinda a weird way. For the price I don't think I'll be back-- at $90 after tax and tip I think the area has a lot more to offer.

Behind the nondescript entrance is a culinary experience well worth the price per person and upfront service charge.  Upon entry, you're warmly greeted, quickly checked in (names, vaxes, etc.), and brought to your seats only feet away. A soothing eclectic mix of contemporary/pop elevator music tests your knowledge of songs and is played at a volume loud enough to discern the song, yet low enough to hear a little of the other diners' conversations.  It appeared to be couples night as the couples' chairs were nicely spaced from adjacent couples with 6 chairs each along 2 bar-type counters looking across from each other.  There were 2 empty seats, so only 10 diners showed for the dinner. Drink service is prompt and there is a nice selection of sakes, wines and 5-6 different beers.  We had tap water, a bottle of sake and I had a bottle of Baeren Schwarz black lager. The diversity of courses kept everything interesting and the creativity with each dish demonstrated forethought that some other michelin starred restaurants fail to show (inadvertently or otherwise). Our 3 favorite dishes were (not in any order):-The uni, which was creamy and briny over an egg, potato and rice concoction that had a hint of cheese flavor topped with a full teaspoonful of Osetra caviar!  A nice mix of basic and extravagance! -The Dungeness crab bits in a warm chowder/soup comprised of mainly an egg custard-like base with shaved lily bulbs on top.  A nice winter dish and warm in the belly! -The Wagyu was cooked medium rare and had some fat that was delicate and flavorful with horseradish sprinkled on top.  Underneath was white rice with an egg yolk.  This was the last savory dish and I was almost full before this point.  This definitely satisfied the carnivorous part in me! Overall, we were very pleased with each dish's novelty and creativity and the ingedients were top notch (some main proteins were imported directly from Japan)!  The service was on point, napkins were replaced, and water glasses were always filled.  The whole experience was intelligently planned and the menus were a nice added touch and nicely presented.  I could see a 2nd michelin star added in the future! Btw, the restroom is super clean! Sorry if the pics are out of order...I can't figure out yelp's ordering system."

I sat at the bar and ordered a drink and when I got it I noticed that there was a ring at the bottom of the glass, I thought it would've been from when he poured the drink so I asked for paper napkins to clean the table and within a few minutes I saw a ring under my glass again so I thought that's quite strange, so I picked up the glass and when I did I CUT MY HAND!! The drink was leaking because the glass was CRACKED!!!! I told the waiter and he was sorry, but he didn't really do anything about it. After that happened, he disappeared and I got a new waiter who had no clue about what had happened. I asked for the Salmon Paradise and I never got my miso soup that is included with the meal. I later asked for my food to be boxed and when I got home there was no soy sauce when I specifically asked him to put packets of soy sauce in the to go bag. When I received the check, I was expecting that AT LEAST I'd get my drink as complimentary since I CUT MY HAND with their glass, but nope! Not even the drink!! Paid the entire check, had to sign it with my left hand because I couldn't even hold the pen with my right hand. So the place is fine, sushi is good (pricey but I guess it's ok for NYC) but my review is low ONLY because I wasn't expecting to go have dinner and end up getting injured. They should check their dishes after they clean them to make sure they're not a hazard for the customers."

Speaking of patio, they used to have a 11pm curfew and after the pandemic, they are in the patio until 3am which is absurd for the surrounding neighbors.

The food was delicious; the utensils and dishes were completely clean;our waitress kept stopping by often to make sure that everything was okay. Our dishes and drinks came pretty fast, despite the fact that the place was actually busy during our visit. They also had a staff member walking around with a camera taking pictures (if you agreed to have them taken) and if you liked any of them you could buy it for $15 per image, which I thought was pretty good. The images came with a cardboard frame with the name of the restaurant and it looked pretty nice, I ended up buying 3 pictures out of the 4 we took. As you can see on my previous comment,  the Manager of the location reached out to me, both in public and privately, he asked me to inform him the next time I stopped by, as he wanted to make sure that I would have a better experience. I actually did not let him know when I went last month, and that was not on purpose, but regardless things ended up being great. The fact that the Manager took the time to read my post, and to respond to it speaks very highly of the place and its management. I would definitely recommend this place and I will definitely be back!"

It it had no taste, it tasted like straight ice which was so weird because it's a hard thing to get wrong. While I'm a pretty easy pleaser with food, I could have blended ice at home instead if paying $8. I told the girl working there that it had no taste. She looked at me with distain and disgust, grabbed my drink and threw it in the trash forcefully with out saying a word. I waited. I didn't even know if she was making another, until the other guy working there brought me out another. This one tasted faintly of banana and nothing else. So strange. I cannot tolerate a bad attitude as any person with a brain would have complained if they were given ice. My partners drink didn't even taste bad but I will never go there again because of the all around strange experience."

It is pretty much comfort food for me. I feel a lot of places can mess up a bean and cheese burrito but this place, makes it the best. Nachos are amazing too. The Cali burrito is stuffed with everything you could possibly want.  I go on my days off around lunch time and its always busy. They got a new ordering screen so if there is a line, it moves pretty fast. The food is always ready in under 20 minutes so you are not waiting around long. Highly recommend for people in this area."

The interior is designed with a French theme, with menu items written in French and wine selections displayed on a mirror on the wall.We ordered an Americano and a dirty chai oat milk latte, both of which were satisfying. The main dishes we tried were the Croque Madame and Eggs with Smoked Salmon. The Croque Madame consisted of Gruyère cheese, classic ham, and a sunny side egg, while the Eggs with Smoked Salmon were served with eggs, capers, and salmon on a slice of bread.Although portion sizes were small, the quality of the food was good. The atmosphere was lively and bustling, but it could get noisy. Overall, Buvette is a charming and casual spot for brunch with a French twist."
26526,1454,L5ZsbTGT1G52p11pNf0EXg,2023-02-23,5 star rating,One of the best Northern Chinese restaurant in NYC . The ambiance is elegant and sanitary in midtown in the design center district. If one want spicy they do that well and present the food elegantly and authentically. Plenty kept all the midtown eastsiders with deliveries and excellently prepared spicy dishes and fed us through the winter and pandemic. But what I beginning to understand is they do non spicy dishes just as well. Sometimes when you don't feel like eating spicy. Look into their menus and you will be surprised. Lately I find they make the best Beef with Broccoli in the area. I appreciate good cut of beef and wok fresh broccoli. This is a New York City dish and I'm proud to recognize it being an authentic wok fresh experience. Takeout their Shredded pork with sweet miso and scallions. I fix it with just plain cold noddles. Or just eat it in lettuce pockets. Or Stir-fried beef with scallion and sweet miso the same way. Braised pork belly with chestnut or with baby bak choy. Must try crispy whole fried fish fillet with pine nuts and sweet vinegar sauce ( their specialty)Most of all they delivery all these dishes to the comfort of your homes and offices. Thank you Plenty.

Reminds me of the good ol college days where you can go somewhere casual get a drink and watch sports. I also got the day breaker drink which was interesting like sweet and salty I think the tequila was good & strong. My boyfriend had the soup beer drink and he liked it.

I've also tried one of their pre-made boxes, Bondi's Best, which features spicy blue crab, salmon cucumber, shrimp avocado and truffle avocado.

However, the customer service upon entry was disappointing. As my husband and I walked in, there was a lady staff at the counter. I had to say hello first. I had to ask, as a first time customer, will I be seated or am I supposed to search for a place to sit? She answered and said I could sit anywhere. The place had low lighting, so it took some time for me to actual find an open table. To add to the lack of service, as my husband and I were walking towards the front entry, a waiter (as we later found out) was getting ready to walk into the restaurant as well. He was a few seconds ahead of us. He sees us, enters, and didn't make an effort to hold the door open. We love to support small businesses but unfortunately, more often than not, small businesses in NY doesn't seem to care about delivering exceptional service to their paying customers. I don't seem to understand why. I'll digress. We ordered chicken and waffles. I had honey my husband had original. Also we ordered shrimp and grits.

I started with a dirty martini which is usually my go to drink. It was almost undrinkable. The brine/olives had a really bad taste to them. I had the steak tartare to eat which was wonderful, and a very large portion. Tasted very fresh and flavorful. I then tried the espresso martini (which is on draft) and that was amazing as well!

However, it was hard to justify spending over $30 on dumplings when we had just come from Chinatown and got them for less than $10. The ones in Chinatown were also larger, juicier, and had a bit more variety in terms of presentation and types. I couldn't stand the Dan Dan Noodles. They were an odd texture and flavor. They reminded me of spaghetti in terms of both taste and texture. I was also hoping that it would have had pork or a more traditional sauce. This one was vegan (?), and the sauce was oddly creamy."

The price of 8 dumplings were over $15, which is pretty pricey but I don't mind paying for good food, especially in these hard times of the pandemic.

Good clean atmosphere with lots of air filters to boot? Yep. Great drinks and lots of half bottles of wine for dinner? Yep. Best of all- the food was top notch at reasonable prices for the city. They gear to the pre theater crowd and they know people must be out by certain times. In fact they asked: 7 or 8p show? Since we had time, we enjoyed a bit more orderly and leisurely meal. Started with mussels which is a treat you can't get at home. A little spicy but not over the top. Use the fresh bread to soak up the extra broth for sure. Then I got the lamb bolognese. I'm a sucker for fresh pasta and this didn't disappoint. It was rich without being Heavy. And really popped with flavor. The pasta was just so so good. Don't miss the ricotta zeppoli's which are basically mini munchkins but way way better. They came out warm with chocolate and caramel dipping sauces. Oh my. Heavenly. Dining companion loved her filet mignon and said it was the best she's had in a while. Same with the risotto. We will definitely be back."

I highly recommend it as long as you are able to find a vacant table to settle down at. I came around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon, and it was a little tough to find a table, but if you're able to come in at a non-busy hour, this is the place to enjoy a nice cup of tea and read a book/get work done. I had the rose green tea, which comes in a  teapot for $7, so it's great for sharing. Quality of the tea is amazing. Super clean and comforting. Would definitely come back again when I find myself again in the area."

I came here a few times and it was always just ""okay,"" but the last time really left a sour taste in my mouth. These buffoons have no idea how to run an establishment. This place is a MESS. I came here after work to meet my slime piece; she got there a little bit earlier being eager to see me. She came outside to keep me company as I stood in line and to drive off other ladies (what can I say?) but the bouncer, a complete hoser, told her to go to the back of the line even though she was already inside. We were shocked. The guy looked like a complete wet noodle too. Weird that a bar would hire a bouncer who looks that weak; can't imagine him running a tight ship physically or mentally. I guess it's tough being such a massive jabronie. He probably got jealous due to a lack of feminine comforts. We get inside and the place is full of degenerates. I'm starting to believe the big apple really is a hive of scum and soy. For a bar that's been around since prohibition, you'd think the joint would be a little classier. At least the place smells its age. Complete buffoons to the left and right of me. I started to worry what my broad might think of me so we had to slam our drinks and dip (we went to a much classier joint afterwards). If you're a soyboy hoser who hates trapping power, the grindset, or the finer things in life, this bar is just the one for you."

This, for us, was a nice surprise that made our travel feel a little safer, but the point is that it should not have been a surprise upon arrival. There was also a lack of information at check-in: I had to specifically ask for a parking voucher (because I knew in advance about that amenity) and had to call back later for the Wi-Fi password (which was pretty slow). I was not informed of the $400 security fee and was shocked to see a (pending) credit card charge DOUBLE the confirmation email's price. I think perhaps they may have been training new staff personnel, though, so hopefully that will get better.My sister could not check-in to her room early despite having called in advance to request it (if possible) due to our planned arrival before her hair appointment for her birthday, and yet my room WAS ready when we got there, so clearly it was possible...that was a bit disappointing and delayed our day a little bit, but we understand it was not guaranteed.Beware, there are no coffee machines in the rooms and the free coffee/tea service in the lobby ends at 9am! (Again, it would have been nice to hear about that at check-in.) We did ask the restaurant for hot water so we could make tea (that we brought from home), but that was a little awkward.As for the room itself, the mattress was a bit too firm for me, not every room has a desk as advertised, and the wall of windows causes poor insulation (the room got way too hot when the sun was beating down through them, and then got way too cold when the sun went down and the howling wind picked up). We really appreciated that the hotel provided a sound machine in each room - not just to drown out the noisy wind, but also the street noise (garbage trucks in the middle of the night?), and the partying neighbors/hallway passersby. The casting feature on the TV made it very easy to sign-in and play a movie or show from any of our own streaming services, which was convenient and helpful. The open-layout shower without a door or curtain made for a very cold (heat escapes too easily to the high ceiling and right out the open doorway) and messy (water splashes EVERYWHERE) shower without any privacy (it really just needed one more row of frosted glass for the average-height person).All of that said, we loved the live jazz music in the lobby/bar area, enjoyed the beautiful architecture and decoration, and the views are amazing, especially from the night club inside an old water tower on the top floor! We visited in winter, so couldn't enjoy the rooftop pool, but I'm sure that's great as well. (visited 1/8/22)"

It was hard to find a table because it was packed - we had to wait a few minutes. Since it was very cold out nobody was using outside tables. They mixed our order a little bit (forgot a few items, but maybe because it was a large order - not sure). Also it is self service: you clean your table and you bring everything to your table too.

There are some prices written on a chalk board by the cashier but these do not necessarily correspond to the selections in the case for the day,  many are simply not stated; expect to spend some money everything is premium priced.Today, ask for something heated - this takes a few minutes; but the counter service person I ordered it from doesn't remember me when it's ready so it goes to the cashier who has no idea who its for (I've paid for my selections at this point). In the while, my food is given by the cashier to another customer who inspects it and gives it back to the cashier. Then the cashier calls out in a loud voice the the name of the item. I went over to collect my barely warm quiche in a small box but I was too angry and humiliated to say anything I was thinking which I'd regret. I left, I was so embarrassed and ashamed that I'd spent +$17 on something I could not eat, threw in the garbage after I left. Never again."

This is such a cute spot for a quick lunch that feels nicer than your typical fast casual spot. There is plenty of sitting indoors and also an outdoor area with a few tables and a roof. The decor inside is beautiful and clean, giving the place a very  fresh and bright energy. You order and pay at the counter and get your food right away. We decided to sit inside since it was nice and air conditioned. For food my friend ordered the Tibetan Mama which was apparently delicious and very filling, the portion size was large and there seemed to be a balanced ratio between curry and rice. I ordered the Botanical salad with added tofu. This salad was so good, fresh, and filling. It came with plenty of lettuce and quinoa as well as pickled veggies and a superseed avocado which I am not even sure how to begin describing but it was delicious-- covered in crunchy seeds and seasoned with mild spices that went very well with the buttery creaminess of the avocado. The tofu additional topping was also great and well flavored (maybe a tiny bit too salty for my taste) but it was a nice way of adding extra protein to this dish. Loved this place and will make sure to return to try their other dishes and desserts! Great location and super cute spot. A bit on the pricier end but this is expected from organic/vegan food in NYC. Would recommend if you want a quick and healthy lunch spot."

Today I ordered my soups with bread bowls because they were finally in stock. The delivery came with the soups but not with bread bowls! It clearly said on the order and on the receipt that I ordered ""BB"" for bread bowl. They offered to refund me, but I wanted the rest of my order delivered since I already paid the delivery and tipped the staff. Delivery wasn't an option anymore.

And he's also so sweet. The staff is just adorable and so funny. Thomas is coming out to personally greet his patrons, ask how everyone is doing and if they're enjoying everything. If the food wasn't amazing I'd give them 5 stars off of service ALONE. But it is. It's amazing. The meatballs are made with rib eye and filet. When I tell you they are cotton candy soft I mean it. It's served with ricotta and mozz, and I don't even like ricotta but I ate it all and I enjoyed it. The Caesar salad is perfectly crisp, not refrigerated, not overdressed, and the dressing doesn't have that nasty fish taste that a lot of Caesar dressings have. It was also the biggest salad I've ever had. My man basically licked the plate clean lol. They only had two specials last night. My man got the short ribs with the special ""super spicy"" sauce. When he asked how spicy it is, Thomas came out to tell him it's made to order and he can have it however he likes. He told the chef to do his thing and boy did he. I had vodka rigatoni. Let me tell you when I have pasta, I want it to have almost a bit of a crunch to it. This pasta was perfectly Al dente, the sauce - I mean do I really have to tell you ? Look at it. My cousin had the white clam linguini. Again, just look at it. I don't have to tell you. I don't drink alcohol, but my man and my cousin told the waiter they both wanted a fruity vodka drink, their exact words were ""give us the same thing but different"" and he did exactly that lol. They were the same color and everything but different flavors (one was orange cranberry the other was pineapple cranberry). For dessert she also had an espresso martini, which she said she really enjoyed, and we split a tartufo. Despite the fact that I starved myself all day in preparation for this meal, the portions are just ungodly. By the time the pasta came We were honestly so stuffed, we had to take it to go. A thought to consider - family style All in all. I knew this place would be everything I dreamed of. I just had to try it for myself, and in conclusion I wish Thomas great health and success in everything he does. He deserves it."

If you want people to come back then offer drinks at a reasonable price or get a new bartender.

After a reservation, once our ""table was ready"", we were led to just stand there in the middle of the room for a few minutes, doing nothing. (Why didn't they just leave us at the bar?!)It took another 30m for anyone to come by for drinks, after asking multiple times.3. Kind service, but impossible to flag anyone down. Servers are zipping by at all times.4. Food ok. It's just ok. Menu looks delicious, but really not that delicious. I would have given this a 3, but the bartenders fingers thing really disgusted me. Additionally my drink, which was not jalapeno-infused, tasted like jalapeno. Which was probably contamination from EVERYTHING else he was making that night. Ugh.I had forgotten to mention that they offered to cut our steak to have it be two adjacent donenesses.  It came out as one, further overdone. Ugh. So having forgotten this, I would have kept this at 2; and additionally the bare fingers thing. Ugh.Ugh."

With my mother, girlfriend,  and I, we shared the cold appetizer platter, the fried calves liver, and the grill Bronzino fish.  The freshness of each of the dips shined on their own merits and the home made warm bread accompany was perfect.  The calves liver was delicious as was the fish. We finished our meal with authentic Turkish coffee,  tea and baklava. The services was outstanding and welcoming; the portion sizes generous; and the resturant very clean. A true tribute to the family's tradition of hospitality and delicious recipes handed down from their grandfather. We left discussing who to share this gem with and when we would be returning again."

The sauce was so flavorful and the meat was perfectly tender. The French bread that came with was also good - airy. Perfect for soaking up the sauce.Loved the banh xeo as well. Very crispy and the pickled veggies and sauce was refreshing. The chicken pho was probably my favorite - I can see how others might find it ""bland"" but to be honest I find that most food in America are overly salted lol. The broth is exactly how I like it. Very fragrant and clean tasting. The chicken was soooo moist and tender and the sauce that comes with to dip in was yummy as well. It's a dish that nourishes the soul!Service was fast and attentive. Highly recommend!"

I thought the dish was flavorful, but something I could make at home or find at a no frills joint in my hometown (SF) for half the price. Pho Bo was decent too--broth was very clean and strong on anise. A bit not flavorful enough for me and I wish there was a more traditional spread of beef cuts (tendon, tripe, etc). The rice noodles were good in texture, not over cooked or undercooked the way some other spots serve pho in NYC.I guess I need to manage my expectations since trendy modern Vietnamese is just different from no-frill everyday Viet food joints.Overall, service was decent and ambiance was great. Would probably come back if I was already in the area but wouldn't trek out of my way to eat here."

The boba came out very quickly, but the store was also completely empty. I didn't expect the number 1 drink to have coffee jelly because I've only ever seen people get their brown sugar boba with no additional toppings, but I'm convinced. Coffee jelly is 100% a great addition and if you haven't tried it in brown sugar boba, now is a great time to try."

29801,1982,XYyIWs-3J4bZRZDfcsMquQ,2023-02-13,5 star rating,"Incredible time experiencing Birdland for the first time. Such an amazingly intimate setting and aura watching some super talented musicians. Only other jazz bar/club I've been to in Manhattan is Dizzy's Club in Upper Manhattan right off of Columbus Circle at Lincoln Center. Birdland is def comparable to Dizzy's but better in a couple of ways in my opinion. First, the venue is smaller and therefore more intimate. Second, unlike at Dizzy's, a party of 2 has the table to themselves. We did not try the food at Birdland but with our wandering eyes the food looked mediocre at best. The Fried Chicken seemed to be a popular choice. But that's not why you go to Birdland. You go to see amazing musicians do what they do best. We had the privilege of seeing Melissa Ericco and her ""A Noir Romance"" show in the Birdland Theater section/level of the club. She and the Quintet along with an additional guest trumpet player put on a remarkable performance that included some story-telling describing the inspiration and feelings behind the Noir theme. The music was inspired from Noir films of the 1940's and 1950's NYC and Ericco's album ""Out Of The Dark."" Ericco portrayed a femme-fatale of sorts canvassing her way through a scandalous underground world full of heartbreak, grime and trouble. And she absolutely nailed it. Couple that with her amazing voice and the other musicians and it made for a truly memorable night. My advice would be to eat and drink somewhere else beforehand. Carmine's is right down the block and that's what we did. Seating for Birdland is first come first serve and we got in line around 7:30 PM for the 8:30 PM show and were able to grab a perfect table in the 2nd row right in the middle of the stage. Servers were great. There is a minimum of $20 per person per set/show. Since we ate and drank beforehand, we ordered 2 large bottles of still water and dessert to cover the additional $20 minimum per person. A piece of Blueberry Apple Crumble and a Peach Cobbler. Both with a scoop of Ice-Cream. They were decent. Will def return to the Birdland Jazz Club. Highly recommend to anyone who loves music, especially Jazz."

Waiters were nice and the chefs are in an open kitchen right behind you cooking your food! The most surprising piece of this restaurant wasn't even the food. It was the SPEED that our order came up. It wasn't hurry up shrimp, more like hurry up sushi. It was amazing. Our dumplings came out in under 1 minute. Our rolls came out in less than 3 minutes from ordering. That is amazing and good job chefs! We went around 6:30pm so it was crowded dinner time too. We ordered the Five Spice Chick'n Dumplings, Spicy Jackfruit Crab Roll, and the Spicy Tuna Roll.Five Spice Chick'n Dumplings: Mid. 5/10. Would not get again. The dumpling skin was very soggy and based on how fast it came out, it kind of felt like these were already premade and just sitting there. The beyond chick'n tasted good but nothing special. Spicy Jackfruit Crab Roll: YES! 8/10. They finally did it! Would order again 100% For $15, they gave 10 rolls that was a perfect blend of spiciness and flavor. It has white rice, lettuce, spicy jackfruit crab, pickled onions, marinated carrots, avocado, chili strands, ponzu, and toasted cayenne sauce. The beyond crab was actually very tasty and had all the right notes of flavor. GET THIS! Spicy Tuna Roll: Solid. 7/10. Nothing bad about this, but nothing special. I felt like the flavor of the spicy tuna was a little lacking so when I was eating it, I barely tasted the veggie tuna. Overall, I think that everyone should give this place a try, vegetarian or not.FYI: Life hack. Download the ""Seated"" app. Book your reservation through there. Save your receipt at the end and upload it onto the ""Seated"" app. You'll get anywhere from 9-15% back as well as a easy $15 for your first order with the ""Seated"" app. You can use this balance to redeem things like Amazon gift cards, Uber rides, Sbucks, Airbnb's, and more! The Seated app is very pleasant to use with a great UI and smooth experience :D"

The two rolls I got were BOMB, and it has to be all thanks to Beyond Sushi for introducing me to the world of delicious vegan sushi. Would definitely come back and try more rolls!!"

It was very delicious and had a very good smokiness to it.  It was garnished very well and they were generous with the olive oil. The bread they served was warm and delicious, but quickly got cold and hard.  For the main course, we ordered the salmon kabob (a specialty) and a lamb and beef koobideh (the lamb is also top notch here).  Both came with complimentary pea soup. The pea soup was like a warm hug, very nice to have in this cold weather, and full of flavor. The lamb and beef koobideh with the special cherry rice was very well cooked and super juicy.  The cherry rice was a little bit on the sweet side, so if thats not what youre looking for, try the dill rice.The salmon kabob was amazing. Perfectly flaky, crunchy on the outside. The dill rice had the perfect kick to it and went very well with the salmon.The grilled tomatoes were grilled from the outside, but raw on the inside. Could have been cooked more. Overall, a very satisfying meal."

Until they were staring at us while we ate and making me and my mom uncomfortable. my mom got up to go the bathroom so I was alone they were talking in Spanish about me and the way I looked. I knew what they were saying and It was unheard of. There was probably 6 of the staring at me all at once and  they just continue to talk about me. That was until I gave them a dirty look and they asked me if I knew Spanish. I said yes and they stopped we left minutes later and I could feel there stares as I got up. I don't wish that experience on anyone. And the food was okay not the best but not bad but definitely not worth what happened.

The shop is decked out pretty nice. All of the tables were occupied when we strolled in, but there were additional tables (hidden) in the back corner of the shop. The staff said to order at the register when we're ready. Since the register was literallyyy next to our table, I asked the worker if she could take our order when she was at the register. She looked and even sounded super irritated and said ""you order up here!"". Didn't think it made a difference whether or not I stay seated as I placed our order, since my seat was literally next to the register. As my friends and I were socializing, we noticed that the worker dropped a stack of UNWRAPPED (to-go) paper cups on the ground. She then picked it back up, and placed next to the rest of the UNWRAPPED paper cups that were resting on a vacant booth where the customers were jusssssst sitting. Definitely glad I didn't get my coffee to-go at that point, but that also made me wonder whether or not my cup was even clean."

For appetizers. we got the spice dust chicken wings. It's bigger than it looks on their menu pictures. It's spicy and has hint of curry flavor. It is perfectly fried. We also got the roti telur, which is stuffed with eggs. It comes with a delicious peanut sauce. For main dish, we got the Sambal Belchan with chicken. It's cooked with shrimp paste and has lots of other veggies. I loved the okra in it. There's a unique green bean in the dish. It has a slight bitter taste but you can't taste it with the dish unless you eat it alone. The only thing I wish the dish had was a little bit more salt. The Sambal Fried Rice with chicken was delicious. It came with an egg and some chips, which added a lot of crisp and flavor. Again, I wish there was a bit more salt in it. We got some lychee cocktails that were pretty and delicious. Forgot the names though. I recommend this place to everyone. It's a good introduction to Singaporean food."

The chicken was flavorful with its unique spices. The chicken choila is served COLD! Wasn't my favorite and almost had a slightly spoiled taste.

Maybe it's too early in the season for Idlis, but I was greedy since I was told that the chef is from Bangalore. Idlis came undercooked. They took it back to the kitchen did something to it and brought it back a little better. First, hygienically not the right thing to do. You should not put half eaten food to reheat with fresh food. It should be disposed of and a fresh plate made, to the best of my understanding.There were crumbs on the velvet sofas on either side. Indian food is messy and they need to give a little more detail to cleaning after customers. I'm going to give the restaurant one more shot - this time go with the safe bet, north Indian food."

It has become an over-run, crowded cafe with hit or miss service and frequently dirty tables. There are too many tables crammed into their enclosed winter ""sidewalk seating"" and the inside seating is loud, trampled over by those in line to order and just down right unpleasant. The decline seems to correlate with the opening of their second location a few blocks away. It seems the new location has taken priority over this original location. No longer worth the premium charged for their menu items."

After 1.5 hour wait, we were seated at a ""shared table."" This was a small 4 person table crushed into a corner that could barely fit 6 petite humans - the couple next to us needed to get out of their seats for us to exit and go to the bathroom (refer to photo). They had an extensive beer menu but ironically didn't carry any Thai beer (or any cocktails) - I guess it's a vibe? Beer arrived in cans with no glass (also part of vibe). My plate came dirty. Food was unique (they pride themselves on extremely spicy unique dishes) but given bare bones atmosphere was not worth it. Also weirdly no appetizers (like I said, bare-bones). Soothr prices without the service or atmosphere - don't recommend the trip."

Going to Ugly Baby during the summer of 2021 required both a reservation a week in advance as well as the list of dishes that the table planned to order. Nothing that I say is of anything new-- Ugly Baby is one of the most unique Thai restaurants I have been to. All of their menu items are names that I had never seen before, which made it all the more exciting.Khoong Muk Kai Kem - shrimp and squid cooked with salted duck yolk. This was absolutely my favorite dish of the evening, and maybe one of the best things I have ever eaten. I ordered another bowl of rice just so I could soak up the remaining sauce. Kang Hoh - pork shoulder and glass noodles slathered with red curry paste and Hung Le curry. Rice is also mandatory to clean up the plate. Laab Ped Udon - Beware, this one is not for the faint of heart. I have a very high spice tolerance, and I could not stomach more than a few tiny bites of this dish. The duck salad is fantastically flavorful, but the spice was so overwhelming that we had to box most of this after several glasses of water."

Recently I came back for happy hour and we ordered the Plato Loco... which isn't as loco as it stated in the menu. It was just a simple appetizer sampler however the items in the sampler were delicious. I got the coconut margarita and it was just right and yet subtlety strong. My friend got the dirty martini and said it was the strongest yet. The 2nd floor is a disco floor with happy hour drinks and food, but you need an ID to sit in and they're very strict with their ID requirement. Not sure why they don't do happy hour on the first floor if it's under the same establishment... makes no sense so minus a star on that.P.S.: the 2nd floor can also be reserved for private parties."

I had my doubts because of the 2.5 star rating, only to find that the low reviews were based off of the air conditioning being too cold or were from years ago. Seems like the management made some changes though. Pretty sure plenty of people have had great experiences but don't bother to leave a review. These old diners are a dying breed. Would hate to see a decent place go under because of some negative Yelp reviews. I came in with my husband an hour before closing time. We were greeted by a lovely gentleman, taken to our seats and were quickly greeted by our waiter who was attentive to us our entire visit. We ordered a burger and a mixed grill plate. Both tasted good and exceeded our expectations. It's a nice neighborhood establishment with a family vibe and unique look, like you've gone back in time - something I love about old diners. The place is also very clean and the furniture seems to be new or reupholstered. And the menu is fairly priced for the neighborhood, including drinks. Plus the portions are big, so you'll get your money's worth. We'll be back!"

We were in the private room for lunch and despite there being about 20 of us, there were constantly servers coming around refilling our wine glasses and cleaning the dirty plates off the table. For the food, the highlights were the focaccia and the ravioli. There's a reason there's no picture of the focaccia it didn't stand a chance - so delicious! The ravioli was simple but tasty. Crispy potato side was pretty good, basically fancy home fries. Wish I knew the name of the wine because that was great as well. Room for improvement lies within the rest of the dishes. Nothing really blew me away (especially when you consider the price). The green pasta was super al dente, borderline crunchy but maybe that's the point? Not for me. The brownie at the end was super dense and fudgy I could only take one bite before tapping out. There was another pasta too that was just a basic rigatoni. Overall the food was pretty good and I would still recommend this place to a friend, but it's definitely not the best Italian in the area."

I almost wanted a little more cantaloupe to highlight the flavors a bit more. The peri peri wings were wonderfully flavored. They were packed with spice, cooked well. My only critique here would be that I would have preferred for the skin to be crispy. The maya bowl was wonderful. Everything in the bowl was fresh, portioned appropriately. My poached egg was cooked to perfection and the avocado was bright and green. Their green sauce adds more intensity to the flavors. When you combine a bit of each item in the bowl you can build the perfect bite. My only criticism here would be that the liquid pools a little at the bottom of the bowl, probably from the squash spaghetti. Maybe if they plate it differently or put some grains on the bottom it would soak that up. Despite the wait, I would come back. The service was friendly and knowledgeable. There was a bit of wait to get fresh black pepper , hot sauce and no check on how are food arrived or we were missing anything but they were very busy and understandably so. The place is small, unpretentious and clean . A quaint place to gather for a casual brunch with fun eclectic music."

I was annoyed because it's 37 degrees out and my wife and I need to shower and we have no towels and a dirty bed. I then call the front and they said ""Did you ask for your room to be serviced?"" Are you kidding me? For almost $900 I have to ask? I have never heard of that. Come here if you need an alright place to stay but do not expect frills.

Also, small table so things were dropping all over the place. That said, the service was excellent. The staff was very attentive although I don't quite like the need to clean up the table before we were done but I get it.... A small spot needs the turnover however it wasn't at full capacity. On to the food.... First of all, the entire staff is Thai and the food tasted more Thai flavors than Vietnamese flavors. The food was not bad. It was actually decent however, I craved Pho and needed that fix. I enjoyed their Thai flavored Pho but it wasn't what I signed up for.

Wasn't blown away, but the food was decent. We were the 2nd customers of the day, so we lucked out and got the little patio seating across from the bar. It was great to get an awesome view.I got an Amaretto sour which I thought was great and had the perfect sweeter/sour taste, not too strong which I absolutely loved. My husband just got a couple sodas.We had the bruschetta app and for our entrees, husband got the ravioli and I got the Tagliatelle seafood special.Unfortunately I just have the app photo and we forgot to take the other pics. But the bruschetta app was tasty. The flavors worked well, just wished the bread was still crispy (was a tad soggy when it got to us). I enjoyed the sweetness of the tomatoes.The ravioli was the star and extremely tasty! Melted in your mouth & the cheese shavings added a velvety smooth taste. I wish we had gotten 2. My dish worked well when I asked for parm cheese to sprinkle on top but there was loads of rock shrimp & nice bits of lobster chunks. I felt it was a tad bit watery.I don't think we would visit again because we weren't blown away, just a nice quick lunch. I wasn't too pleased on my way out, we saw a bunch of gnats flying over the bar. I am happy there were no insects while we were eating."

On the one hand, I like the decor and the visual concept, it's a fun space, casual and relaxed watering hole that allows you to self serve. But on the other, oddly missing wait staff and it was near impossible to get someone to clean the tables so that we could dine after the other parties left. This was a busy Saturday afternoon, even at 3:30pm - Soho was bustling with packed cafes and restaurants. This place was 85% full. You enter, grab a table and designate someone to get online to order at the register. There's a full bar and a variety of alcohol drinks available. I thoroughly enjoyed my somewhat muddled iced tea with mint. It was a pretty red color like a hibiscus tea. The menu is simple - bar food, casual eats like grilled cheese and burgers, cheese steaks but they have chips, fries and premium Belgium fries. They sell salads, fish and chips and some Mediterranean fare. It was honestly hard to decide. Don't laugh, I got a grilled hot dog (came with chips). I just wanted something small but salty. Hee heeNote: in my group, I tipped but it seems no one else did. Drinks were given instantly at the register unless you ordered a cocktail. Since you're ordering at a register, there is no table service. But that meant less cleaning and not everyone cleaned up after themselves.  After paying, you're given a folded metal license plate to display at your table, the # represents your order #. Food was good but nothing memorable. Good people watching spot and casual hang out. Low maintenance vibes."

The food is terrible and there was a bug on the lemon slice they placed on my glass. To add to this I won a gift card recently for $25 that I wanted to put towards my lunch bill and was told that it couldn't b put into the system. It was too old. I explained that the school purchased it for a Chinese auction and I won it. She was rude and off putting. I told her fine I will no longer eat here and I will b telling the school not to include ur diner in their auctions because u don't honor them after purchase. She complained and complained and them had to take $3 off the gift card to not honor. $22 out of the $25 prepaid card was finally honored after at least 15 mins of their bad customer service. Go somewhere else. U won't b happy after ur visit there. Giving it 1 star just to b able to get this warning to u

Plenty of seating at the bar down the left wall and a good number of tables down the right. Bathroom in the back. Fun and funky but clean. At least a couple of tables outside too. That's all good. But for me to give a bar five stars it has to be a full-on drink haven. Very strong bartenders here. Friendly, chill, there to serve your buzz. But also quick to offer a glass of water while you order. I love a place that's a beer bar with lots of taps, but also a real cocktail bar where they know how to make a good drink!Speaking of drinks, I loved my oatmeal stout and they made my girlfriend one of the best Negronis she had on our trip to New York. And she had a lot. Yeah, we were day drinking and night drinking, since you asked. New York offers a lot, but this sweet li'l spot was worth writing about now that I'm back home."

They offer a $130 tasting menu with the option to add on an uni rice bowl and swap the wagyu for their beef Wellington (extremely worth!!!). This meal was not only a feast for the tongue but a feast for all of our senses. They really take care of ensuring each dish not only taste amazing but also look, smell, and even sound appetizing. From the sizzle of the hot plate on their Foie gras course to the textures and flavors of each dish, we were taken on a journey from start to finish. The service was impeccable and you could tell each member of the staff understood the process and flavors of each dish as well as their chef. It came down to around $220 a person after tax and tip, but was well worth the experience! Definitely splurge on the uni bowl and beef Wellington! The addition of caviar and truffles is also quite worth the price!Check out my foodsta @chiuventure for a closer look and more details of my dining experience here as well as other establishments in NYC and around the world!"

My favorite dishes were: 1. Uni Bowl. The uni is sweet and melts in your mouth. The seaweed rice is so flavorful. We both loved this dish so much and ended up getting two bowls. It's a dish you need to pay extra for. I want ten of it if we don't need to care about the price. 2. Foie Gras. I love the crispy rice under the foie gras. I never saw or tried this food pairing before and I was impressed. 3. Potato Bread. It's a side dish of the Wagyu beef. It's so chewy and tastes like mochi or rice cake. I can see myself snacking on it if I can get a bag of it. Other than food, the service was excellent. The restroom was clean and smelled nice.

My wife and I ordered strawberry margaritas ( which are delicious) along side their spinach dip and chips. I LOVE their dip. My sister and niece ordered chicken tenders and fries and had enough to split amongst the two of them. This place reminds me of why I love diners so much. They become your family. The waiters learned about us, asked what our native language was and made sure to make us feel right at home. This diner has been apart of my family for decades and I'm sure it always will be!"

We started with the ikura don and although it was not bad, I was fairly disappointed because it looked nothing like the pictures they posted on Yelp. The portion is no where the same as the pictures. Don't be fooled!The Kara ramen (spicy) and tamashi ramen were good and filling. The kara ramen was a bit thick and very salty. I found myself chugging a lot of water after. The tamashi ramen was nice and clean as it was described on the menu. Perfect for a not too heavy dinner on a cold day but I could've used a bit more flavor to it.

Bee cafe is right in the heart of the community serving coffee and food while maintaining a welcoming environment. This place has a lot of warm colors when you enter, and is reflected in their staff as well. There is plenty of seating and even a back patio area with heating and a cooling area which is even lovely on a rainy day. Food wise I got this hamburger which comes with fries and a coffee. The burger was simple and fresh tasting which is interesting for a burger. I don't usually think clean when thinking of a burger, but Bee cafe has figured it out. I also love their coffee. My buddy got the Avocado toast and on our first outing got the croissant ham and cheese sandwich. He is a regular at Bee Cafe and loves their food. Overall it was a great experience eating and drinking at Bee cafe while listening to tropical house play through their speakers.

I was looking for a lounge in the city where I can host 30 people on a Saturday night without breaking the bank and after an absurd amount of research I stumbled upon Madame X.I love the fact that the manager/owner is accessible and I can speak with her over the phone/text when making a reservation. My reservation was for 4 hours (9pm to 1am), it only cost me $100 and I ended up having the an entire section for my group. Our section was big enough to seat 12 to 14 people. A lot of red decor, nothing fancy, but definitely gives a chill vibe. From what I remember (my friends kept buying me drinks) the music was a blend of 2000's rap, contemporary afrobeats, and some 70's/80's r'n'b. I just remember it was a solid mix of urban music. My friends seemed to enjoy this spot and the music. The only caveat is they don't serve food, but you can bring your own as long as you clean up after yourself and pay a deposit in case you make a big mess.They have an upstairs area, which I didn't have a chance to peep and modest backyard area.If you don't want to deal with long lines, pretentious door policies, but want to hear some good 'old school' rap/r'n'b music (I just can't believe 2000's is considered old school now, but it is) and smoke hookah then hit up this spot."

Not a lot of places you can get a BOOT of HB, but Yer Man's is the MAN when it comes to a great dinner or drink experience. Large screens throughout mean you can always see a game or a match, no matter where you are in the building You may even be lucky enough to catch a live theatrical performance in the back room they've been known to generously sponsor over the last couple of years!  BRAVO!"

ROACH crawling around the whole counter , half an inch away from the food. The workers saw it and giggled and whispered to each other and continued to try to serve me as if I was blind of the situation. The roach crawled halfway to the middle of the counter and all the way back. One of the workers even said to her other coworker ""we were just talking about this last weekend"" absolutely disgusting. Please do not go here unless this place cleans it up ASAP!!!!"

I honestly wouldn't blame them for being half-awake and cranky (like most people at 7 am), but they're so friendly! It's very clean inside and is one of the newer builds with the touch screens although I don't use them since it's empty when I go bc normal people are still asleep. So yeah, there's my review of a McDonald's in the middle of Staten Island of all places. Thanks guys!"

I enjoyed my personal pizza at Singas Famous Pizza, it was absolutely delicious. An added bonus for us was that we were fortunate to meet one of the owners.

We had a wonderful conversation and enjoyed our time at Singas because he made our experience extra special. One thing that always resonates with me when I'm out and about is customer service.

I finally came this past week for a birthday lunch!The service and ambiance here is wonderful. From the host to the server, everyone was so welcoming and accommodating.We kept our order very simple - two dirty martinis, one minetta burger, and one black label burned - both medium.The martinis were delicious, and there's no better place to enjoy than Minetta. We were anxiously awaiting our burgers and fries, and the presentation did not disappoint. The fries were perfection. Although the burgers were cooked perfectly, they were completely unseasoned. No trace of salt at all. As nice as the meat in these burgers was... a little salt would have gone a long way. Not running back, but really enjoyed my afternoon lunching in this restaurant."

Upon walking in, you can smell the seafood. Absolutely divine. Not an overpowering smell, just enough to let you know they make it and season it well.The decor inside is very beautiful. Neutral colors, whites, browns, tans, etc. It all goes together very well. I ordered from the prefixed menu. For appetizer i got the beet salad. Super delicious. The beets had this weird coffee/chocolate taste. The first two pieces were good but after that, i was over the beets. The arugula was delicious. The salad was topped with feta cheese and pomegranates which were my fav part. The salad also had these thick slices of onion which aren't pickled or put in warm water to kill the spicy kick or overpowering onion taste. Everytime i ate one, my eyes watered and the onion taste killed my taste buds. Overall this salad was okay. For the main course, i asked for the chicken kebab. It comes with chicken pieces on a stick (2) with salad, pita, fries and tzatziki sauce. I didnt get a greek salad, instead i was given the same arugula salad i already had but with tomatoes. It was seasoned so i loved it regardless. The chicken was tasty, not dry or too charred from the grill. The fries were good. Some absorbed the tzatziki sauce and salad dressing but that just made it even more delicious.I think the $30 prefixed lunch is a steal. With how ridiculous food prices are right now, i think this is a great deal. The service has been pretty good. Upon entering the restaurant, the host walked me to a table right away. The front of the restaurant seemed a little empty but once taken to the back, there were 6 tables occupied, three of which had five or more people. So it was pretty lively in the back. I wish i would of sat at the bar. I possibly would of gotten quicker service. I noticed that my waitress WAS the bartender. Which had to have been difficult for her. I feel that she shouldn't of had to handle the bar and tables, thats alot of pressure. And also leaves the customer, like myself, waiting for service when she was slammed at the bar, not cool.My food was delivered by a food runner to my table. He was also picking up the plates from the tables and cleaning them up, etc. After ordering my food, i didnt see my waitress again until i got the check. The table runner did come and check on me but not the waitress. I also wasnt asked if i wanted another beverage, nothing. I ended up asking the runner to pack my food to go. The waitress then came by and asked if everything was ok. I asked for the check, paid and left. I dont think i would be back here. Simply because i am always looking for a restaurant i can be in and out of within an hour, because i am on my lunch break. I got here at 1:08pm. I didnt get my main entree until 1:40pm. I rushed to eat what i could but had to take my food to go. So that was a bummer. The service could be better but it wasn't the worst. The food was tasty but i wanted more. Overall, okay place for a visit. Come with enough time so you won't have to rush."

I am very sad I didn't get their names but they were FAB! A gentleman & beautiful young lady took great care of us. We ordered drinks & ordered happy hour menu appetizers for dinner. BEST DECISION EVER!!! We ordered the pikilia, tomato salad, spanakopita, avgolemono & the sesame feta... everything was phenomenal. The sesame feta was one of the best things I've ever had & the vibe was amazing. The restaurant was lovely and I only saw the ambiance of the dining area in my way to the restroom (which was also lovely & clean). No regrets here people, we had a 10 out of 10 rating at the bar. Great service & FANTASTIC food. Thank you to the lovely mixologists that made our evening perfect!"

My cravings = satisfied every single time. The cover photos of this place consists of 3 of my photos :))))Food: 5/5 oh my lord!!!! THE VODKA PIZZA SLICES ($4.50) DO NOT FAIL. ITS LITERALLY HEAVENLY ESPECIALLY STRAIGHT OUT OF THE OVEN. THE TASTE, THE SMELL, THE SAUUUUUUCE I'D GIVE IT A 11/10. The sauce just drips with the slice of pizza and its flavor is just on point.  It's so creamy! My mouth is watering as I speak and I kind of need myself another slice...White pizza slice (4/5 ($4.50)) As this was our second slice each, it was a bit cool by the time we got to it. We were too focused still on the Vodka pizza! But, the cheese was definitely not melting as it did when we first got the order. If it were heated up once again, I don't see why this wouldn't be 100%. Thing is, it might be a bit bland in terms of the entire slice covered with two (?) different kinds of cheeses?OMG slice (4.5/5 ($4.50)) We were recommended this to us! It had artichoke hearts, spinach, tomatoes, ricotta, fresh mop, and Romano topped with balsamic glaze and a sesame seed crust. Definitely loved the twist with the crust! The combination of the ingredients definitely put this all together. Again, I'm more of a meat lover so I might be a bit picky on this, heh.Ambience: Still with the televisions and the music - it made it a nice ambience to eat it!Price: Total came out to be ~$18. This isn't really out of the ordinary especially the quality that comes with the food.Service: She looked like the manager but girl oh girl she is so enthusiastic and suuuuper chill! She even complimented me :) 10/10 recommend."

It looks much more glamorous than the Ralph's Coffee in Hong Kong! To sum up, I really enjoyed dining in the UPS branch as the furnitures, decorations, beverage quality contributed to an excellent atmosphere.Unfortunately, cleanliness of the dining area could be largely improved. As a high end café brand, there were some pastry pieces on the floor, and a fly kept flying around my table which was really disturbing...＊ Cappuccino w/ Oat MilkNice latte art! Rich nutty espresso flavor and good amount of foamy milk, creating a perfect blend of oat milk and espresso. ＊ Hot Chocolate w/ Oat MilkA hot chocolate is a must during the holiday season. Perhaps because of the oat milk, the hot chocolate was less creamy and not sweet. I usually dislike drinking sweet beverages, but this chocolate definitely hit my spot. Yet, if you prefer an Italian thick hot chocolate which is sweeter and richer, this might not be your choice.＊ Scone w/ JamThe menu wrote that the scone would be served with butter and jam but sadly I was told that only jam was available. Given the steep price, this American scone was disappointing, probably unfresh. It wasn't toasted before serving, the texture was too dry and dense. However, it was cute that they provided Bonne Maison mini strawberry jam, which rescued the scone overall marks a bit. My Recommendations:Cappuccino, Hot ChocolateWorth Returning? YES I'd love to grab their holiday takeaway cups!Follow @nyc.bgoo on Instagram for more honest food reviews!"

It is literally crammed like a sardine tin can in here but the smell of the Shawarma can make you overlook that part. The halal street carts that are situated on 86th Street are definitely popular in the neighborhood, but if you have time and a few extra bucks for a real authentic Middle Eastern meal, Karam is your best bet.For the meat portion they provide and the sides that accompany it, the pricing is reasonable. I always go with lamb and with the sides, you will realize the meal is probably meant for two people. I believe their platters come with hummus and pita, and a sizeable portion of yellow rice.

She insisted we pass on by here and try the chicken. She said the whole menu was on point, but the chicken needed to happen. I didn't protest in the least bit. We got in and the smells overwhelmed me right away. Loved everything I was taking in. Finally got our chicken along with pickled jalapeños and pita (which I could not have) and we went to town. Without a doubt the best rotisserie chicken I've had in a while. Now, it's easy to dismiss chicken in almost any form when you go out to eat (maybe it's hard to ignore it when its in its most glorious state of chicken parm), but I've been on a quest as of late to try chicken dishes regardless of where I go. Whether it be ""fine dining"" or a no-frills hole in the wall. And this is hands down an impressive whole rotisserie chicken. The skin is brimming with seasoning & spices and the chicken itself is incredible juicy and tender. Some places can brag about how good their skin is & yet sell you some dry a*s chicken. This place does not do that. At all. This is a straight up delicious, glorious, rotisserie chicken. The toume (Lebanese garlic sauce) that comes with it is f*cking fantastic. You give me a mason jar full of that and I'm in heaven. Absolutely delicious. I mentioned above that I had to skip the pita, but the smell of the freshly baked bread was so much for me to endure I almost broke and had a buncha pieces (I'll save it for next time). This spot is a must go-to and I can't wait till I'm back here again to try the rest of the menu."

Today in particular I ordered an hour in advance to get around this; Asked several employees at the bagging counter if my order was even being made... ya know... cuz I ordered an HOUR before showing up... and also they SENT A TEXT NOTIFICATION SAYING MY FOOD WAS READY FOR PICK-UP.  Wasn't. As soon as I saw my name wasn't on any of the screens I knew immediately my food was just not going to be made.   Asked the two employees who handle the customer line where people come to pick-up food and neither of them had any clue, though they were very clearly trying to pretend they did [but it was SOOOO obvious they didn't.]""If your name's not on the screen that just means they haven't taken the ticket... just wait a bit and it should be ready""Knew IMMEDIATELY that was nonsense; explained several times to both employees, politely, ""Yea but I ordered this stuff an hour ago"" - Same answer - Explained again ""Yea but they sent a text notification stating it was ready for pick-up"" - SAME ANSWER (for some reason) - Explained my food was said to be ""ready for pick up as of 11:55am - 12:05pm - I was waiting all the way up until 12:20 - SAME...

Today in particular I ordered an hour in advance to get around this; Asked several employees at the bagging counter if my order was even being made... ya know... cuz I ordered an HOUR before showing up... and also they SENT A TEXT NOTIFICATION SAYING MY FOOD WAS READY FOR PICK-UP.  Wasn't.

I decided to stop at Panera for coffee and a quick breakfast. The ordering kiosks were full of tourists so I used the app to order an egg souffle and a coffee.I had to wait a long time and eventually the woman filling the orders told me to go up front and have them give me the souffle. Really? Weird. She did give me the coffee cup so I could make my coffee, but having to go back to the registers to ask for my order sounded strange. The woman at the register seemed just as confused and she didn't have any forks, so she gave me a spoon, which didn't quite work with this.I took everything downstairs so I could sit and eat. I didn't stay long, although I did use the bathroom. Thankfully it was clean."

We were getting on our way out of the city and the traffic to I-495 was impossible. So we just pulled over and found the closest restraunt. We ended up stumbling on this tiny restraunt down the street.  There's plenty of free street parking and it's pretty quiet around here. We walked in and it seemed like a cute, humble little place. There were 2 tables inside that sit 4 people each. There was one lady behind the counter. This lady did everything, she ran the whole place all by herself! She mentioned that her daughter helps out, but she wasn't working at the moment. She was so kind and it felt like home. We ordered the Tum Poo Plara, I ordered it cause I normally love papaya salad, and this seemed like a more elevated version than the usual. We also got the Basil Fried Rice, Kua Gai, lychee Thai ice tea, and coffee with cream and sugar. There's 1 small bathroom inside should you need to use one. It's pretty clean, but small. Despite the whole restaurant being run by 1 lady while fulfilling take out orders at the same time, it took her about 10 mins to prepare everything. It was pretty impressive. But our party of 3 were also the only ones in the whole restaurant. We also went later on in the day around 2pm. Everything smelled amazing and the noodles and rice were steamy hot! The lychee Thai ice tea was refreshing and very sweet and tasty. The Tum Poo Plara was very very flavorful, spicy with the perfect mix of umami from the fermented crab, sweetness from the tomatoes and the sauce, and sour from the lime and fish sauce. It was amazing. The Basil Fried Rice was pretty good too. It was delicious and not super oily or salty. But the star of the table was the Kua Gai. I've never heard of it before or tried it. There were these thick broad rice noodles stri-fried with thin strips of chicken with flavors of coconut, peanut, spice gave the dish such an amazing complex flavor that was so deep and mindblowing. I think this dish could have easily been $30 in a NYC restaurant. It was so good. It came with a small dish of siracha too to dip the noodle in which just made the noodles taste even better! After we were done eating the plates clean, she suggested we try the sticky rice mango dessert. So we thought it sounded good and we got it. She prepared it fresh with the streamy hot fresh sticky rice next to the perfectly riped mango. The dessert was actually my mom's favorite part. When I tried it, I cut a piece of the mango and ate it with a scoop of the rice. And oh man. I just melted into blissful heaven. I felt like I was melting into the dessert. The mango, sticky rice, and coconut milk just dissolves into your mouth with no unpleasant textures. The flavors and textures just work perfectly with each other. I think the mango was the softest, most sweet mango I've ever had in a restraunt before. Overall this place doesn't deserve 5 stars. This place deserves 10 stars. She prepared the food with such love, and detail. The presentation was beautiful and the food was to die for. This tiny place is a hidden gem. We tipped her very well and left very satisfied. If you haven't tried this place before, you need to sit down and experience this food. Trust me. You won't be disappointed."

I ordered the braised pork over dry noodles and the portion is so generous, given the price! The veggies of the day it came with were fresh broccoli, carrots and red cabbage. The noodles are chewy and tasty, the braised pork slices were flavorful and melt in the mouth and there were a lot of pieces too. I'm glad this dish has so much variety, making for a very filling meal. My only critique is that the sauce for the pork is a bit too salty, so I hope they adjust the recipe to be less. The serving was a lot for me, so it's enough food for 1.5 - 2 meals. They also served salted peanuts and pickled cabbage which were very good. They offer lemon water on the side too. The cashier was friendly and accommodating. Glad to see a spot offering classic Taiwanese dishes, so I'll be returning to try their starters and rice dishes."

Very tender and juicy little bites. Had to try the braised pork belly over rice, so very good. Tender and perfect. Not salty and just very good flavor. There are still more items on the menu to try. Loved the free peanuts that they offer and I would believe made in house. The place was very clean, small little place with a couple of parking spots in the front. A couple of tables inside and nice and quite. The service was very friendly and in a timely matter. Will be back soon."

Firstly, the decor in this place was lacking. Every other MFG restaurant I've been to has gone over the top with decor, it almost feels like your being transported into a perfectly designed world/setting. The theme is clear and you feel like you're apart of the story they're telling. Dirty French on the other hand very much just felt like a standard hotel restaurant, which I guess in reality it is. The food was also extremely underwhelming. I started off with the Little Gem salad, which was a large serving (definitely enough for 2-4). The dressing almost tasted like a fancy ranch which I enjoyed. The crispy shallots were also a nice touch. This was probably the best thing I consumed, besides the free bread that comes at the start of the meal. For my main course I had the Chicken Persillade and Pommes Louis. The chicken arrived lukewarm, and the sauce had a strange consistency. The flavor was overwhelmingly garlicky, and there wasn't much else to the dish. The chicken had an okay texture but was a little stiff. The Pommes Louis was also unremarkable. The potatoes had a pleasant fatty flavor, but they were inconsistently cooked, some pieces being overly crispy, some soggy. The potatoes also come with garlic sprinkled on top, which didn't seem to incorporate well. It seems like the menu relies heavily into garlic to save the day. The one thing I will give this restaurant credit for it the service. Everyone was super friendly, attentive, and kind. Overall I think there are much better places to have not only French food, but a meal priced this highly in New York. I would not recommend going out of your way for this one."

The cocktails are very good! I had the L'Échappé Belle (tequila, strawberry, tangerine) and it was delicious (also came on fire, which was pretty fun). My friends were also very happy with their drinks. For starters we tried the complimentary bread which is FANTASTIC, lamb carpaccio (so good), tartare (fresh and had an interesting mix of spices) and the mushroom milefeuille (a bit disappointed as I was very excited to try this. The curry sauce is great but I don't feel like everything was coming together and the mushrooms lacked seasoning). For main course I had the hanger steak au poivre - right temperature, great sauce. Our table ordered a bunch of sides: the mashed potatoes were so silky and delicious, dirty rice was the unexpected favorite and even the green beans were great. There is no birthday without dessert, so we tried the beignets and the chocolate cake, both very good choices. We finished our amazing dinner with espresso martinis.

The Fois Gras is savory with the perfect touch of sweetness because of a jam sauce they spread onto the plate. I had a drink that had a cinnamon spice to it, it was one of those drinks that came with a lot in the glass, and a very fancy tiki glass with a fire presentation when served. Which was a plus.

CONS:- nothing bad honestly, it was good but it also didn't blow me away. Would I come back for it? Not the omakase, but definitely for sushi and esp if a friend wanted to try it.  The service was amazing.

The breakfast was fine, but at $17.95, I thought it was a bit on the pricey side. However, I cannot fault the restaurant for this because I saw the prices before entering. In my defense, there were not too many sit-down breakfast options in the area at that time. Prices aside, I will say that the service was pretty top-notch. One minor pet peeve: My tablecloth had several (old) stains on it. Here's my thing, ditch the tablecloths if it's too much work to keep them spotless or near spotless."

That's been a very tough question I have been pondering all week? I paid a visit last Saturday to get a better answer to this question We found a table to the rear of the bakery and a friend and I ordered marzipan treats, a chocolate eclair, a cannoli, and a Napoleon. After we left the premises, we discussed our impressions. It is not mentioned in most reviews and shown in photos, but La Guli has a few seats and tables available. Elisabeth rated her overall experience as good. I had very mixed feelings about themAs to be expected, there is definitely an old world charm to La Guli and the ambiance is a throwback to the 1930s. La Guli has been around 85+ years. Unfortunately, this was ruined by stacked paper supplies and some garbage on the floors. The bakery is a bit of a clutter fest.As for the deserts and pastries -the Napoleon was considered very good. My first impression of eating marzipan treats was excellent, however, the éclair had mostly dried out and lost its flavor. I bit into the cannoli and it tasted off immediately. The cream had almost evaporated and I thought I was eating watery milk. I had to throw it away.."

Anyone who has had Persian food knows of its great abundance and flavor, even from the simple base of saffron rice and up. We haven't had as many family gatherings since the pandemic which means way less delicious Persian food.I had been wanting to try Persian cuisine in the city for so long--I was really craving it. My mom and grandparents looked over some of the top places in the city and put their heads together and decided that Persepolis looked good in terms of dishes and price range.I took the train uptown with my roommate and stumbled upon a small, clean, and candlelit establishment. I could tell a lot of the customers and staff were Persian, which is honestly a good sign. There were some confused tourists next to me which was also funny, I witnessed them try their first kubideh and attempt to order it.APPETIZERS- complementary pita. I love free things. interestingly paired with plain tahini- I would recommend adding the Yogurt trio or hummus which to me feels more filling/classic ENTREES- Every Persian child knows that Ghormeh sabzi is a timeless classic. I had to try theirs to see how it would stack up, the Ghormeh would tell me everything I needed to know- My roommate got the regular version but I got the vegetarian which I've never seen on a menu before and I was happy about it. I was planning to get the regular but eat around the meat because it is that nostalgic for me- Definitely want to try the Polo Albalo (sour cherry rice) next time but didn't think it went that well with Ghormeh Sabzi. I opted for the plain rice- It was exactly what I wanted. It transported me. Great portion size- (I do consider myself an expert and extremely qualified on this dish btw) So, my only comment was I wish it could be slightly thicker and less watery and for the veggie version, more beans. Would probably give around a four and a half if yelp offered half stars because nothing beats my mamans, but I love to see a Persian business thriving"

I very rarely have had a terrible experience, but this was on a completely different level.After sitting down and waiting 5-7 minutes to have our order taken in an empty restaurant the waiter (the only male waiter) approached us in not the most accommodating manner. We asked for water and it was lukewarm and not even cold. Waiter did not even offer any ice. After placing orders for two burgers with bacon, waiter did not even specify the temperature they cook it nor ask how I'd like the burgers cooked. After receiving our burgers, both me and my brother noticed that not only was the bacon burnt, my burger was overcooked. I politely asked the waiter to make another burger with the right temperature. I want to stress again that I very rarely have asked to have any food remade.The waiter was not only condescendingly rude in my request but also made an excuse about how and when they take requests for burgers temp preferences.After receiving the new burger, although the temperature of the burger was okay, it was missing the bacon I had ordered initially. At this point I didn't even want to ask because it's been pretty evident that the employees (waiter) is highly incompetent, unprofessional, and careless about his job.At the end of all this, the waiter's behavior was passive aggressive as he gave us the bill (also charged for the bacon that I never got). Worst part of it all was after swiping my card, didn't even give me the chance to choose the tip as my brother did which only solidified that this waiter is absolute trash. I will never support this business after all this. There's plenty of amazing restaurants in park slope, please look elsewhere or at minimum be aware of this terrible waiter/manager that has a position here.I want to make it clear that I don't mind paying as much as I have to for a good restaurant as long as the service and professionalism is there, and I hope this saves a few people from having the same experience I've had. Given my large group of followers, I will absolutely be making sure this is made aware to anyone that may visit this location."

The space is clean and airy, featuring subway tiles on one wall opposite exposed brick on the other, marble tables with bright red metal chairs a retro cast-iron ""Eat"" sign complete with antique bulb lights, and wall art vaguely correlated to Italian culture. Acoustic, multilingual music plays unobtrusively in the background, mixing with the clatter of ovens and utensils. Straight back, a wide variety of colorful pies are prominently displayed on the pizza counter. A slow trickle of other patrons continued throughout our visit.However, the good vibes ended with the decor. The slices were lukewarm, and the cheese wasn't even melty. The crust erred on the cardboard-y side. The cheese slice was bland. While the pepperoni was infinitely better with its rich and spicy oil, this was offset by the $5 charge per slice. With so many cheaper and tastier pizza joints across the city, I see no reason to ever recommend Vinnie's except for sheer convenience."

We noted that at least when we entered; there was no menu with prices in the front of the business. We were greeted quickly and seated very quickly which was appreciated. I asked for the non alcoholic spirit options to which the bartender provided a rather unfriendly ""we don't have any"". How do you ask me without verbally asking me why we sat at a bar if I don't drink?(hint: give me the look and reaction this bartender did) However to the bartenders credit; she rebounded quickly realizing I wasn't kidding and offered a ""soda of the day"". An appreciated gesture. (The soda was good) When we looked at the menu; the prices were surprisingly expensive for how the storefront presents itself. My partner and I are open minded so we stayed. We ordered the prosciutto to start. $18 for 5 pieces of meat and 3 pieces of bread is a rather unreasonable ask. The plate came out as expected minus the quantity provided. We then ordered the second course of a pesto pasta. $28 for pest pasta is also a rip off considering they give you about a cup and a half of a serving. Pasta is inexpensive as is pesto. The final dish was the $44 scallops. We got 5 over cooked/burnt scallops that were still decent tasting. However; they were no $44 good. Noteworthy is it took *forever* for food to come out and the restaurant was not packed out. I would expect for the prices you are paying a much higher level of service. Save yourself time and money and go to saringhinas cafe down the road. Or go to Walters by the park. Better view, better service, and more affordable. *restaurant also deceptively puts tip in food prices then allows for option to tip more for their subpar service buyer beware**"

Between 2 people we split a Cesar salad and bolognese. You can tell that even the dressing is made from scratch. DELICIOUS. They brought a basket of fresh bread Im guessing is made in house. The bolognese was amazing so fresh and best I have had. Pasta to sauce fresh and delicious. Even though I had half portion I was stuffed.

I was not impressed by the ramen; the charsu cuts, although large, were on the drier side with little flavoring. The toppings only included a piece of bak choy, diced white onions, green onions and 2 sheets of seaweed. Sadly, the broth was tasty but lacked umami. Portions were appropriate and price point was $15. The service was great as they turned around the tables in lightning speed. Clean and nicely decorated."

I've been wanting to go to Sushi On Me for some months since I first heard about it but it is pretty hard to get reservations. I was VERY lucky to be able to snag two seats two days prior to a Sunday dinner at 6:30pm - someone must've just canceled! I took it as a sign that I must go!I was honestly nervous that I wouldn't like the ambience. Reviews made it seem like it's super clubby and party party. I tend to be a little more reserved and shy, and quite frankly over the party stage of my life. I mean I'm a mom of two now for goodness sakes. So when I saw a bunch of tipsy 20 something year olds leaving the 5pm reservation I was like oh boy...Seats are super tight. You are literally shoulder to shoulder. Make you sure use the bathroom beforehand because there is no way you getting out of that chair - it's impossible unless someone pulls your stool back and push you back in. Music was loud but not deafening. Music choice was good ranging from ""careless whisper"" to ""YMCA"" to Backstreet Boys. Food was absolutely phenomenal. There was literally not a single thing I did not enjoy. The only thing that truly made me uncomfortable was there were two appetizers with CBD/THC smoke. I happen to have a job where I can be randomly drug tested at any given moment. I personally do not know if any of this will show up on drugs tests so I gave it to my husband to eat it. The smell was in the air and I'm concerned breathing it can be an issue but I can only hold my breath so long. Unlimited sake which sake boy did a good job refilling throughout the meal. F-bombs thrown left and right - typically not my style but whatever. It's just a really relaxed atmosphere. Nonetheless it was an amazing experience. Food was superb. Great music. And the service was impeccable. They were really trying to make us have a good time. I'm afraid this might've set the bar for omakase for me!"

Barbecue Chicken was way too sweet and it's filled with only barbecue sauce. For the appetizers we ordered the Butterfly Shrimp, Chicken Wings and Masala Fries. The butterfly shrimp was again okay, the wings were average and masala fries oh my my let's not call it a fry because you won't find seasoning but you will only find gravy YES you heard me right it's gravy fries that was soggy and mushy.

We've been to Antepli Baklava 2 in Paterson, NJ and enjoyed it. I'm giving this five stars based on the quality of their baklava.I do have to somewhat qualify the five stars by mentioning that this location doesn't have seating (the Paterson location does) and therefore we would have had to order the kunefe ahead of time and take it to go. We did get a delicious selection of baklava and I ate it on a bench they had at the front of the restaurant.The place is clean and bright, the woman working there was pleasant, and the chocolate baklava is outstanding."

I had intended to purchase kanafa for a family member and this was the first occasion where I had purchased from this particular bakery. With that said, the customer service was immediate and I was notified about how it was freshly prepared. Each slice was carefully packaged and I paid a reasonable price for the quantity that I had received. I provided a five star rating because the serving method was unique in which the sugar syrup was provided in a separated container. The kanafa itself was still warm and it produced a pleasant mildly sweet flavor with a rather dense texture. My grandfather was impressed so I would return again."

My steak was a bit tough considering it was medium rare but not bad. The bone marrow didn't have much on it but i think I've been spoiled by other places. We ordered the Hazelnut grove for dessert which was a little disappointing. Overall it was a nice meal but nothing memorable.

The curry also has very strong beef smell (stinks). Seafood yakisoba is straight up Shanghainese deep fry noodle. Noodle is way too crispy like cracker. Also, the seats are very tight and the place is very small. Even though it's cheap just 10bucks for a meal, I rather stay home eating instant ramen than coming here."

It is also one of the best deals in the city with a true lunch buffet that has both the variety and the local support to make a worthy destination for anyone in the area.I was introduced to Haandi as the late night spot for all the cab drivers looking for a quality meal. Despite being a two level establishment, the interior is very cramped. The upper floor is mainly a la carte and takeout, which is what remains open throughout most of the day and night.I somehow stumbled across their basement level lunch buffet, which was $9 when I first came and has transitioned into a $12 current day feast. The bathrooms should be avoided and the sanitary / hygiene is legitimately questionable, but that's also part of the charm.The food is not earth shattering, but the variety is appreciated. I appreciate the fact they serve some type of biryani (typically chicken or lamb) often, the seekh kabab is tasty, and the chana masala goes well with just about everything. I also like their hockey puck sized aloo tikki and I most definitely can eat a few of the meatballs.I've found much of the food to be a bit on the oily side and their breads / samosas are abundant but not particularly memorable. I'm also not terribly fond of their salads either and haven't found many sweet / dessert like items I can get behind.What I most definitely appreciate is the no frills / keep your pretension at the door mantra of the place. Despite being open all the hours, they don't normally have a lot of staff on hand. This essentially means to serve yourself and pay (in cash, even though they accept credit), and get out. I never manage to leave here without being completely stuffed and both my wallet and tummy are happy. Just the way it should be._____________(#1) i.e. Murray Hill"

The vegetables were overcooked and minced into small unidentifiable bits. The Broiled Black Cod  was the worst I ever had. The best thing about this place was the glass of cold house sake I had at the bar while waiting for my take out dinner and the steamed white rice.

The pizza was ready in 30 minutes and was hot. The pizza looked okay and smelled yummy. Unfortunately, it was sub-par at best. The pizza sauce was very vinegar and had a sour taste. Each bite of pizza should include a bit of bread, sauce and cheese. That wasn't the case here. It was like they put a bit of cheese on some parts and then sauce on the other. I am not sure why they made the pizza like that especially a traditional  cheese pizza. The crust was pretty dry and subpar at the best.I am not sure if this pizza spot is only known for their specialty pies but, their traditional pie is trash."

The restaurant itself is consistently kept clean, and the staff is always friendly and helpful. My most recent purchase from this Qdoba was an online delivery order. When the order arrived, half of it was missing. We got in touch with the restaurant and they corrected the problem immediately, all the while acting courteously and professionally.

Good quality meat, soft, juicy and flavorful. The soondubu was kind of disappointing. The seafood was low quality and tiny. For the price I expected more from them. You do get a lot of banchan and side dishes like Korean pancakes and a rice dish so the combo is more than enough for two.The service was awkward. They will cook the meat for you which is great but our server was standing over us and tossing the meat in front of us the entire time which was kind of awkward. It felt like she was between me and my partner and we couldn't really talk until all the meat was cooked. They also cooked the 3 meats consecutively. Wish they spaced it out a bit because we wanted to eat slowly but didn't want our food to get cold/overcooked. I think it would have been less awkward if our server engaged with us but she didn't introduce herself or even look at us. If you want a chill place for bbq with friends I don't know if this is the place to go. If you just want quality kbbq then this is the place for you. Maybe just stick with the meats though."

I cannot chew on ""pits"" and pretend it's cool and just chug it... nope... can't do it. As for the fruit version - we tried the strawberry + yogurt, this one I liked very much! Exactly like a smoothie.  Sweet and smooth, good combo.  Our worse reaction has to be their ""Black Sesame + Yogurt""... this combination was awful! Tasted terrible. It's like the black sesame was fighting off the yogurt and lost... and it spoiled. Really bad combo - sweet, smokey yet sour? Will not order this again.

Next time, I'm going to skip the tomato, though. My only complaint is that it was (or seemed) expensive. $22 plus tip--so $27 total. That said, I would go back; the patty melt looks really good."

The fish tacos were a nice portion since I was not really all that hungry. I though the fish could use a little more seasoning  but it was still very nice. My friend got The Night in Bangkok which she thought was good but also could use a little more seasoning. The reason I won't be back to this spot is the outdoor seating was a bit dirty that it attracted roaches. The place had quite a number of roaches crawling on the tables and the outdoor seating fixture it was really disgusting. While I know that a lot of this is out of their control I think they have to maintain the outdoor seating and food on the floor. The unit next to this place had mice in the unoccupied hut. The whole experience was pretty disgusting and disappointing my friend is still traumatized.

There was more OIL than sauce in my platter. I could probably fill up a whole cup with the amount of oil I received. I basically paid $30 for oil. Even the rice was gross, and Im not sure how you can screw up rice. Worst indian food i've ever had. I could not keep eating after 3 bites.

You can't go wrong coming here (seriously)... Maybe your looking for a winding down bar but that's pretty popping? Yup! This is your spot too. I really need to hand it to Mary and Janette, they command the bar (with ease mind you) and provide a none pandering serving that should be championed. I'm sitting here (close to the front door) and I enjoy the smell of cigarettes (and bud). You need to appreciate the alcohol that had soaked into the bar top over the (idk how many) years. After walking up the strip I saw midway and was like I think I need to go here.Listen... Stop wasting time looking for the ""best"" spot in Williamsburg and just come here and enjoy your chill night."

Service was average, good burger bar vibe, location clean and convenient. Overall it was good, but not a top choice in the area.Patty melt was the best item that we ordered. Both got out burgers medium rare and they were cooked perfectly. Food was good, but the flavors weren't very pronounced. Truffle cheese fries were disappointing, wasn't worth it to pay the extra for speciality fries and should have just gone with regular. I got the Black Iron Burger specifically because of the horseradish cheddar and mayo and I could barely taste the horseradish flavor."

The hot soup revived me. The sandwich came wrapped in paper which seemed like it had been made ahead and refrigerated. It had little flavor so I enhanced it with a liberal sprinkling of black pepper and Tabasco. A tiny ramekin of coleslaw and a fat pickle accompanied the sandwich. A cup of drip coffee and a slice of strawberry cheesecake was dessert. Lulu, the server, seemed harried and gave me a slice of plain cheesecake at first. Then the correct one came with strawberries on the side and puffs of whipped cream. The flavor was muted and not like the ones I had eaten before. Prices even in diners have risen dramatically since the pandemic. My lunch with tip cost $28. The diner is quite large and clean. I sat in a booth and sank in so it was a struggle to get up.

Parking is somewhat tricky being Bayside, as only street parking is available.As for the food itself I found the pho to be just ok. The broth is not as rich as the one from the Grand Street location, and the amount of meat in the Pho Xe Lua (#1 ""Big Bowl"") is definitely less than expected. The price is also somewhat higher than the Grand Street location. I also expected the round eye of beef to be semi rare per the usual preparation, but it was already fully cooked when served.Overall I would come back out of convenience if I am looking for pho in the area but I don't think it is worth going out of your way for."

I have had pho many times at different locations and it is one of my favorite foods but this spot ruined experience for me. There is no competing pho stores nearby like Flushing does so I came here.I ate in the restaurant the cold water they give tasted like sink toilet smell. Probably straight from kitchen faucet. The meat had a smell/aftertaste to it that was not good. Tasted cheap and soup base just tasted like salty ramen water. Usually the broth is the main reason I get pho with the hearty meat and veggies noodles. This was dissatisfaction.I ordered drinks because the water tasted terrible and soup too but the drinks were horrendous too. Service is okay but just the taste of food is a no for me....

We ordered cocktails to start and the drinks came out quite strong. I really enjoyed my matcha coconut cocktail, and my friend had an old fashioned. We ordered the spicy chicken ramen and two rolls of sushi. Sushi presentation was beautiful and came in this gorgeous boat like dish. The fish was fresh and tasted good. My friend's ramen was also well made with all the flavor notes. This place is great for a quick bite, casual weeknight dinner or lunch with friends. The street is a little tucked away so it's not crazy busy, easy to hear each other talk. Service was attentive without feeling rushed or ignored. Great place!"

The menu was also enticing: besides the usual espresso and coffee drinks, there were some interesting variations like a berry rose tea latte, a butterfly tea latte, or, in my case, a Cloud 9 (espresso, whipped cream). This rang up as $6.00 even though it was posted as $5.75 (see photo below), an overcharge that I didn't discover until later, and came beautifully presented, although filled to the brim and all but guaranteed to spill when picked up. Which it did. So I would have appreciated being proactively warned or offered a lid to contain the drink. Service oddities aside, the Cloud 9 was a creamy drink that lived up to its name, plus the setting certainly couldn't smell any better."

The botanical vibe full of succulents morphs into a fluffy, light and posh side of subdued fresh and dried florals on the other side of the small shop. My rose latte was not gimmicky at all. For $6 (not bad for what it was), I had a stunning latte, perfectly mild on the rose. An excellent latte in quality of milk froth, art, and actual espresso. Wifi was meh, but other than that, fantastic spot. Clean bathroom as well."

Instead of going downtown, we stopped by their branch in midtown since our hotel was in the area. My first impressions of the place was that it's your typical pizza joint -- nothing special expect maybe for the pictures of famous people on their walls. The place was clean enough, had lots of napkins, condiments, and smelled yummy. Pros: - hot, fresh from the oven- thin, crisp crust - generous toppings- reasonably priced- fast service - tasted wonderful Cons:- carbs if you're not a big fan Why the 4?

He refused to replace any of it and said she would have to make another order. With all of us working in the food industry at some point, it's about the customers and how their experience goes.

It would have taken someone less than 5 minutes to spray and wipe the tables. The workers at this location must be on strike because no one restocked anything. No one cared.All of the juices were empty. The utensils looked as if they were thrown into the holes from 10 feet away. And apparently the entire soda machine was broken so no drinks at all. The only thing they actually had in stock was disappointment. I think the worst part of it all was that it was only 5 PM!! They close at 10, so the store is gonna be in this condition for another 5 hours.Everyone at this location must have started working there today. They must have trained the cleaning employee to only change out the trash because the man was legally blind when it came to the tables and only took out the garbage. With that said, I've worked at Chipotle before and thats why I know the only reason the store looks this way is terrible management.

No rice, no meats, crusty salsa, no fountain drinks, no forks, no water bottles. Right down the line we all know so well. If you try to pick up an order ahead meal the employees look at you like you just ran over their dog. Have been 3 times over the past 12 months and will never go back.And make sure to take note of the giant pile of food waste and trash in the middle of the dining area barricading the bathroom doors - which haven't been open for over a year.Is this restaurant an actual legitimate link of the Chipotle chain or a 2nd rate knock off somehow operating under the radar????"

Though the prices are a teensy bit higher than your average Chinese bakery, the cleanliness, packaging, and presentation of the goods here are a notch above the rest. I've had their pineapple coconut bun, sponge cake, and their coconut roll (pictured here). All were delicious. Their bread is really soft and slightly sweet. The pineapple coconut bun had ample amounts of that coconut flake filling that I love. The sponge cake really surprised me too. I thought it would be your average sponge cake, but it was so soft, fluffy, and cloudlike. The texture was similar to a Japanese cloud cheesecake. They sometimes have the matcha version as well. Don't hesitate to grab it if you see it!"

Seven Grams Caffe has the best vegan chocolate chip cookie that I've ever tasted, and I'm not being hyperbolic. No exaggeration. The plump, gooey cookie is baked to crisp perfection. It's so good that I bought two (I ate one and froze the other for future consumption). The cookie costs around $5. Staff was friendly. The cafe is clean, sleek, and modern, offering adequate seating indoors and outdoors. The oat latte was also delicious."

They don't do espresso drinks or Turkish coffee or pastries or things like that. But, their regular drip coffee is drinkable (even for an espresso snob). My dining companion says the decaf is surprisingly good. They make breakfast oatmeal fresh to order (which takes a while), and you can customize it with milk, sweeteners, fruit, etc. it's very large and watery. The pancakes smell amazing. They take cash and there's an atm in the corner. Service is a bit slow when it's busy (eg Sundays). It's basically the only place open around here on a Sunday, so be prepared to wait a bit and make way for the next diners!Nice comfortable booths and friendly servers."

It was an adventurous and hands on dining experience for sure. I wore the gloves provided by the restaurant, my friends did not.

It is definitely easier to get reservations are this location! It is a 15min walk from the Nassau spot on the G train. We were seated immediately once we got there. I booked the indoor counter. I like the experience! You can also chose to sit at the table and I believe all your hand rolls come out at once. At the counter the chef hands it to you one by one with some time in between. At one point there was one chef and 8 people at the counter so it took some time for each hand roll to come out. I always get the create your own set. My top choices are:-toro scallion ( you can add caviar for $12, I really wanted to try to and it was delicious. A special treat)-salmon avocdo-uni (LOVE my uni, there were 3 different choices (maine, santa barbara, and hokkaido. They're all at different price points with hokkaido being the most expensive one). - spicy x.o. scallops (love the kick to it)I usually get 2x salmon avocado since I think you have to pick 5 for the create your own set. My bf also likes the spicy lobster and got 3 of them!This time I also got an extra toro scallion and salmon avocado. You can always order more after you eat! So fresh and delicious! Clean and chic place, similar to the one in Manhattan. A note that everything that add up especially if you add caviar, etc. Unless you are ordering the vegan hand rolls, you will prob spend on avg $60 or more."

DO NOT under any circumstances order from this place if you want to be charged money for food that is NEVER delivered and be treated like trash in the process (don't complain later, you've been warned).I decided to give this place a chance and ordered from them for the VERY FIRST time via Seamless. What a miserable mistake that was. Of course, the order NEVER arrived, and of course, when I called to inquire about the order an incredibly argumentative guy answered the phone and said his delivery guy had dropped it and taken a picture. I told the guy a million times that no one ever ringed my apartment so that I could grant access to the building and that there was NOTHING outside of my apartment door, but he just kept speaking over me and treating me as if I my only goal was to steal a meager piece of chicken from him. Who knows where the #$%^#@ his delivery guy dropped my order but it sure as hell wasn't HERE!I hanged up the phone as I refused to spend more time trying to convince the guy that they were actually charging me for something I never received. I contacted Seamless and they were shocked at how bad this was handled by the restaurant and how sketchy the whole thing was. They immediately gave me a full refund. Won't ever order from this nightmare of a place. Don't do it. There's much better and more reliable options in the area."

The service was very tentative so that was good, made sure I was well and happy. The food was a bit lackluster and the flavor and sauce profile was mid. I order a steak and it wasn't the best, it was very dry and kind of a weird color, and didn't taste right. Maybe cause it was grilled but it wasn't as juicy and meaty as I hope it was. The best stuff was probably the calamari, clean and good with the sauce. The atmosphere was pretty nice but the tables are crammed together so prepare to slip and slide your chair around."

We also got hot and sour soup and spicy chili pork dumplings, both we would get again. We also got the short ribs which we would probably skip for next time. The service was also great they were very attentive with water refills. We will definitely come back here for the dumplings."

The Marinated Cucumbers were crisp and delicious, they make a great starter before the meal. Pea Shoots were a perfect share portion, steamed to perfection with a hint of sesame, very tasty.

However, the people in our party all arrived at different times but the staff was very accommodating. A+ in regards to service. There were 11 of us so we just ordered a bunch of pizzas and pasta. To be completely honest I don't remember everything we ordered but I tried it all and it was all quite good. My favorite thing of the night was certainly the Spicy Arabiata pie. The shiitake bacon and cauliflower added some great texture and flavor to the pie and a nice helping of basil on top was refreshing. The crust on all of the pies was nice and crisp with the right amount of char. Another pie I really enjoyed was the Basil Sunflower Pesto. It's definitely a more exotic type of pizza, but as a fan of pesto I was very pleased. My favorite of the pastas was the Cacio e Pepe. It wasn't too heavy and the flavor was simple and clean (in a good way). The pasta was cooked well with a nice chew to it. For a return visit I'd probably get this again. The food is a little pricey but it was very good. I wouldn't mind coming back."

Felt very welcomed.Won't go into details in each dish this time as they change menu often. Menu was very well structured.First - served 3 small bites. Overall balanced, delicious but nothing too jumped out.Second - served 2 apps. Third - a seafood entree & lamb entree. The hake was a bit bland & underwhelming. I usually don't eat lamb, so coming for this menu, lamb was my only nervous dish yet I trusted Frevo to deliver. And they did. It was not gamey at all but you can still get that lamb taste which doesn't disturb. Petit filet piece was very soft & tender. Main piece was the saddle which was a bit tough but also doesn't bother me. African spice was on point, paired great, adds a perfect kick. Very impressed.Fourth - desserts - the part that fell short for the overall experience, just no wow like other dishes.Overall good quality was consistent, good variations in color/presentation, and flavor. A side note that the sauces were all on the heavy texture side, I assume is the heavy use of heavy cream? But the taste wasn't heavy.One of our guest was late for the dinner for the first 3 bites (which is quite a lot as the menu is not big). They just wouldn't serve him. In a way I understand where they are coming from, but shit happens and it's unwillingly to be late etc. So it sort of ruin our mood for a little.Service is attentive yet you can sense a touch of snobby vibe and tones. I mean they are good so. I would recommend."

The inside was ok but also dark and dingy.  The website's menu on line is not the one at the restaurant so we had choices that no one was especially pleased with.  For example, I ordered juevos rancheros which was basically one egg on taco chips sitting on a red watery sauce, and sprinkled with white cheese - tasteless.  We all ordered different dishes and no one found the food appealing.  The most ridiculous things is that they only had enough espresso for two cups of coffee, so the rest of us had to drink tea or brewed coffee (that was pretty bad).  I can't figure why it has received good reviews unless people like a dingy bar in El Barrio.  But never again for us!"

Lobster pasta is da Ace u need to order. I will not describe as you should really order it n understood why I said so. Overall, amazing. Would be great if you reserved first.

Essentially, I run the gambit concerning food whether it be Asian, Caribbean, South American, American food (from silk worm grubs to intestines and this food as far as taste was the worst). Most everything I had that night seemed rushed and not thoughtful. I tried the cheese fondue with pork - bad friggin idea. It seemed exotic because it was listed on the menu in Spanish. However, it tasted as horrible as it seems. Boat load of cheese and grease with very little pork slivers in it. SMH Had a couple of the different type of tacos. Horrible. I guess because this place is hyper authentic, the soft taco tasted like dirt. I ask if you're reading this to please help me in forget the experience. I feel that ultimately, I'm not a fan of Mexican food. But, I'm a fan of great tasting food. There's a restaurant called Miti Miti that's leaps and bounds better. Relatively cheaper prices too. This place unfortunately does not offer the flavor of the aforementioned place - possibly due to Gran Electrica being very authentic. Service and ambience was very good  though. The owner came by and apparently felt slighted because I refused the Molé after one bite. The bill came to $600+ tip so I feel that he could have ""eaten"" the cost of the rejected meal... and possibly gagged. Save the 'attitude for the cooks. Waste of time and money. I'm not rich. Based on the price I feel cheated."

But the third night, they were on fire: insulting customers, charging me things I didn't order, taking my credit card away without my permission.The owner told me I was a ""sale race"" and a ""putin de crevard"" when I nicely asked for my card back (in french that means ""dirty race"" and ""fucking stinge""). They also charge people more tips than they give on a regular basis and talk openly about it.No comment."

We were seated outside by request and it seemed like they were doing us a favor preparing us a table without a reservation, but when we got outside the patio was 80% empty. **Decor & cleanliness, 5/5** Decor is gorgeous. Soft pinks and retro themes, down to striped paper straws and a jukebox. The patio is absolutely gorgeous, but not all tables are in the shade.**Price & portion, 2/5** Pretty pricey for the ingredients used (nothing premium really) and the portion size.**Presentation of the food, 3.5/5** The food isn't presented as well as the restaurant itself. For example, the potato latkes were a bit too burned and the plate looked a bit plain. Some fruit and additional seasonings / toppings besides the chives, such as a lemon wedge for the salmon, would've rounded out the plate.**Taste of the food, 2.5/5** The potato latkes with smoked salmon were okay but was bland overall. I had to heavily season w S&P, the potato latkes were a touch too burned and didn't have much flavor, and combined with the unseasoned eggs, plain creme fraiche, and just slightly salty salmon, the dish was underwhelming. That said, it wasn't too heavy of a dish like I originally feared and the eggs were perfectly poached, but effort on seasoning and presentation would've taken this up to a 4/5 at least.**Other notes** Restrooms are super dark for no reason. Make sure you listen to the options for water! I heard ""still or sparkling"" as the options and opted for still, which ended up being $5 for a 12 ounce bottle. There's also tap water, which is free."

We were staying at the hotel above it for 9 days and our Amex card got us free food each day. We could use it in the convenience store in the hotel for snacks or at the Italian restaurant down stairs. 3 people 45$ each day. So of course we used it for salads and pasta at the restaurant.   But I literally couldn't be the one ordering because the man was so mean to me and we wanted to sit and eat in the restaurant but he totally treated us like garbage. I ignored him and had someone else order and grab the food, but I wasn't gonna let his rudeness keep me from my free salads for lunch. Salad and pasta  is greater than convenience store chips.Feel free to reach out if you have q's on the Amex perk!"

It was a busy Sat. night, but they seated us reasonably quickly. Our server had a funny-sort of attitude when we first sat down -- perhaps she was having a tough night? (She warmed up to us by the end of the dinner, when she realized we spoke Spanish -- she was clearly not Italian.)The food was not memorable, but was decent. My fish entree was well-prepared. The wines were about the same -- good, but not memorable. We'd been spoiled by a truly bonafide Italian restaurant the night prior much further north up the West Side, so this was more touristy, perhaps, being close to Lincoln Center. We've lived in Italy, so are a different sort of clientele. I don't think I'd want to return or would recommend it. But it was an adequately pleasant Sat. night dinner. However, a caveat: of course, this is Manhattan!, But be aware that it was not inexpensive. Our two glasses of wine & two entrees, no appetizer or dessert, cost $100."

Smashed it with my hand on the wall, which was more a reflex than a flex. I told the server & he was indifferent - no apology or remorse.  Food: 4Quality: 3Service: 2Portion to $: standardClean: uh, noThe service is chaotic, to say the least. They all seem stressed, confused & when they're needed: indifferent. I love that word. Maybe they don't have enough people working. Maybe it's management. Or, maybe they just don't care. Time is irrelevant to these people & waiting needlessly will happen unless you do something about it. I'll leave that up to your imagination. Food is good though. Nothing was bad, although nothing was great, either; everything I've had has been solid, though. Tad overpriced, tbh- but that could be just me being cheap. I like eating at the counter when I'm Han Solo, but it's kind of gross. However- you'll get your food faster there, so... Now, about that roach. Most people would be bothered by this, but  this didn't bug me much (looks at camera). Look, I grew up in the jungles of the pacific, it takes a lot to freak me out. What did give me pause was the layer of filth that seemed to be everywhere. Sticky floor & table. Utensils that seemed... not all the way clean from the touch. Lucky for me: I eat with my hands. Now, all that being said: I'd actually come back. Am I unhinged? Perhaps. But, my reasoning is simple: there's nothing else like this in the hood & I'm too lazy to trek downtown. You should probably never read my reviews going forward."

I almost wanted a little more cantaloupe to highlight the flavors a bit more. The peri peri wings were wonderfully flavored. They were packed with spice, cooked well. My only critique here would be that I would have preferred for the skin to be crispy. The maya bowl was wonderful. Everything in the bowl was fresh, portioned appropriately. My poached egg was cooked to perfection and the avocado was bright and green. Their green sauce adds more intensity to the flavors. When you combine a bit of each item in the bowl you can build the perfect bite. My only criticism here would be that the liquid pools a little at the bottom of the bowl, probably from the squash spaghetti. Maybe if they plate it differently or put some grains on the bottom it would soak that up. Despite the wait, I would come back. The service was friendly and knowledgeable. There was a bit of wait to get fresh black pepper , hot sauce and no check on how are food arrived or we were missing anything but they were very busy and understandably so. The place is small, unpretentious and clean . A quaint place to gather for a casual brunch with fun eclectic music."

So horrible I had to stop and write this for the possible benefit of other human beings.To start with, their NYC tap water (by all accounts the best tap water in the whole world) had a burnt oil smell. Took forever to get a simple order of a few burgers. Our bill was so late I had to take a walk to the cashier to see what was going on - all workers having a chat while we waited. When the bill arrived, there was a total (including the tip, already printed on the bill - I guess that is a new thing, ""mandatory ti""p) - and an open value for ""more tip please""?? I guess they assumed we were not locals? Go figure. The waiter *really* wanted us to pay in cash - why, I don't know - quite insisting actually.While we waited for our check, we had more than enough time to watch huge rats peacefully strolling around tables and patrons. :barf:Yes indeed, quite a horrible experience.

My review is not related to the food, it's directed to the quality of service. We usually go there on weekends but this week we went on a Wednesday evening. So, to begin the man seating us had quite an attitude with us but I didn't let that get to me and moved on. Then the young waitress was kind off rushing us to order so we asked for fried calamari and right off she said there was none.!!!!! So while we deciding which appetizers we would order she again came back to take our orders and out of the blue.... She said she was informed that they DO have calamari. So we ordered it. During this process she never asked anybody neither went to the kitchen to ask!!!!! So then we placed or entrees order and more than 45 went by which by then a party of 6 People came in 25 mins after us and they got their food in less than 8 mins !!!!  While the waitress delivered their plates  she realized I was watching her and then she and another server were at POS Machine giving us looks and talking about us. So by then my partner went in to talk to the host and he had this careless attitude and never checked on our food. But by then 19 mins later our food was delivered to our table ""lukewarm""  and I'm pretty sure our food was just waiting to be picked up. Anyway we began to eat and the waitress ame by to ask how was everything and I told her nicely that in all the years we have been coming here we have never waited so long for our food, and then she gave us this sad story that she was working alone !!!!!.  But then we felt we were being rushed to finish our food. Mind you when we go to Joya on weekends the place is packed and food is always brought to us within under 8 mins not 45 mins with an attitude plus she forgot to bring cutlery and when we asked for the hot sauces she gave us a lecture and said no. I had to tell her we always order calamari and get the four sauces to dip the calamari. Anyway. From now on I will not go to Joya on a weeknight. To me this was a huge dissatisfaction and disappointment as I did work in the food Industry for more than 22 years and this was not the way I expect to be treated when I'm paying !!!!!!  So instead of keep looking at your cellphone you should pay more attention to the customers just like the water boy/ bus boy he was so nice to everyone and was working his ass off. I also wanted to be known that we love this place ambience and cleanliness but customer service needs to improve fast as I have always invite people to come and try but if you keep treating people like this you'll know what is gonna happen. The weekend staff seems to know what to do. The Wednesday staff are so lost. ( except the bartender!!!! And the kitchen staff)Oh and also and Asian kitchen staff kept fighting and arguing with the host they our entire stay at the place. They were so damn loud it wasn't nice."

I do not expect chinatown prices when I visit Vietnamese spots in other neighborhoods, that is completely unreasonable. However I DO absolutely expect Chinatown quality when you're charging me 15+ for a rice bowl that would be $8 on Baxter street.The first time I came here my tofu banh mi was good and bigggg so it was completely satisfactory. Unfortunately, I have since found out that the meat here is not seasoned D: I got the chicken rice bowl for a friend after vouching for this place off the strength of my first experience with the sandwich, and I was told it had no flavor! I don't eat meat but she was going to put it in the garbage so I tasted it to see if I could save it (I would rather eat the meat than throw it away) and agreed, there was not even salt on there. I managed to make some makeshift sauce out of coconut aminos and sweet chili sauce that I had in my pantry to save it lols.All in all two wheels is the best viet I've had on the upper east side and the food is not bad, but all of the Vietnamese food I've had elsewhere has been significantly more flavorful."

The waitresses are all so friendly and attentive. This has nothing to do with the wonderful waitresses. We decided to take our kids my mom & in total there was 8 of us. I ordered chicken scampi sounded great but I get it and my knife could barely go through the chicken it was like hard rubber this was just my dish everyone else's was good  I called the waitress over and told her and she took my plate away and some man came from the back and told me to check the middle of it As I explain to him I couldn't even get to the middle of the chicken and I wouldn't want to  at that point he gave me a dirty look and looked at what everybody else ordered at the table and said oh chicken and chicken and walked away and was beyond rude to me in front of my family it was a very uncomfortable situation why would anyone want to try to get to the middle of a bad piece of food? My husband went over to tell him it would bounce of the floor I can't express anymore how bad the chicken was and how utterly rude he was it was almost unbelievable the way he behaved the bill was over $300 which we expected and we were happy until that moment needless to say that man was disgustingly rude and should realize in these inflated times people can barely afford to even go out to eat we will NEVER go there againTell everyone I know our experience.

I see this big sign saying Ralph's coffee walking on 5th avenue, and wonder why Ralph Lauren has a coffee shop. The decor was absolutely amazing. From the amazing coffee sign at the front of the restaurant, the relaxing outdoor seating, and the amazing indoor aura. The AC and humidity inside was definitely a great change of pace on a hot summer day. Also the indoor is kept so clean, bright, and polished.The service was extremely nice, from holding the door, as soon as you enter, walking us around the Ralph Lauren part of the store, and even helping suggest coffee items. I ordered one iced matcha latte for 6 dollars (about the same as your typical Starbucks order). I realized later that I did not add sugar to my latte, and the service prepared a whole new drink for me. It tasted great, was a quick-grab-and go. Highly recommend taking a visit."

I stopped in for a late-ish to-go order, around 9:30 PM and ordered the Aloo Papri Chaat and Dal Makhani. The Chaat was cold and the potatoes weren't cooked all the way through and the Dal was so spicy your head would explode. Now, I LIKE SPICE - I even like it when it burns my tongue a little but not to the point where my whole mouth and palette is blown out for days. Both items were totally inedible, which sucks on multiple levels: 1) I didn't eat dinner and 2) I had to toss food in the garbage and 3) I won't ever go there again. It was that upsetting. I used to really like this place. :o(  Bummer."

It was hands down one of the best food days of my life. I had class next door and and every morning on campus I would walk past smelling all the smells and finally decided to go in and have lunch. I was put into a food coma. If you've ever watched food wars, this is what it was like. I'm not here to debate about what the best ramen is, but I can confidently say that this place has GOOD ASS RAMEN, and definitely the best I've ever had so far. I got Miso Ramen and the set with vegetable curry. It came as a lunch set that was reasonably priced by New York standards(from Chicago). It was brung out pretty quickly and looked mouthwatering. The broth was perfectly cloudy and flavorful and even though I have an onion intolerance I devoured the shaved green onions on top. Everything was PERFECT for me. The pork was A+ and I was stuffed once I finished the ramen. I was regretting ordering so much food, but the minute I tasted the curry I prepared myself to make room for it. I will never forget this feel and the euphoria I felt eating this Ramen. And I can't wait to be on campus again to eat it again."

Firstly, the decor in this place was lacking. Every other MFG restaurant I've been to has gone over the top with decor, it almost feels like your being transported into a perfectly designed world/setting. The theme is clear and you feel like you're apart of the story they're telling. Dirty French on the other hand very much just felt like a standard hotel restaurant, which I guess in reality it is. The food was also extremely underwhelming. I started off with the Little Gem salad, which was a large serving (definitely enough for 2-4). The dressing almost tasted like a fancy ranch which I enjoyed. The crispy shallots were also a nice touch. This was probably the best thing I consumed, besides the free bread that comes at the start of the meal. For my main course I had the Chicken Persillade and Pommes Louis. The chicken arrived lukewarm, and the sauce had a strange consistency. The flavor was overwhelmingly garlicky, and there wasn't much else to the dish. The chicken had an okay texture but was a little stiff. The Pommes Louis was also unremarkable. The potatoes had a pleasant fatty flavor, but they were inconsistently cooked, some pieces being overly crispy, some soggy. The potatoes also come with garlic sprinkled on top, which didn't seem to incorporate well. It seems like the menu relies heavily into garlic to save the day. The one thing I will give this restaurant credit for it the service. Everyone was super friendly, attentive, and kind. Overall I think there are much better places to have not only French food, but a meal priced this highly in New York. I would not recommend going out of your way for this one."

We noted that at least when we entered; there was no menu with prices in the front of the business. We were greeted quickly and seated very quickly which was appreciated. I asked for the non alcoholic spirit options to which the bartender provided a rather unfriendly ""we don't have any"". How do you ask me without verbally asking me why we sat at a bar if I don't drink?(hint: give me the look and reaction this bartender did) However to the bartenders credit; she rebounded quickly realizing I wasn't kidding and offered a ""soda of the day"". An appreciated gesture. (The soda was good) When we looked at the menu; the prices were surprisingly expensive for how the storefront presents itself. My partner and I are open minded so we stayed. We ordered the prosciutto to start. $18 for 5 pieces of meat and 3 pieces of bread is a rather unreasonable ask. The plate came out as expected minus the quantity provided. We then ordered the second course of a pesto pasta. $28 for pest pasta is also a rip off considering they give you about a cup and a half of a serving. Pasta is inexpensive as is pesto. The final dish was the $44 scallops. We got 5 over cooked/burnt scallops that were still decent tasting. However; they were no $44 good. Noteworthy is it took *forever* for food to come out and the restaurant was not packed out. I would expect for the prices you are paying a much higher level of service. Save yourself time and money and go to saringhinas cafe down the road. Or go to Walters by the park. Better view, better service, and more affordable. *restaurant also deceptively puts tip in food prices then allows for option to tip more for their subpar service buyer beware**"

Otherwise skip it and head towards better options in the area. Staff are kind inside all the venues and they have a fair selection of options once inside. Place is also clean, nice to eat inside, but I'd rather take the food and head outside the oculus if weather permits. It's usually a gorgeous view."

Lastly, staff do ask to see ID and vaccination cards.  Overall, great clean eating areas and a solid selection of sustenance.  The restrooms are also right across and the escalators are right next to the entrance."

Just steps from the 72nd Street 1,2, and 3 train station; super convenient location to lots of retail shopping and the Beacon Theatre. Service was great and the menu was simple and satisfying. I was originally going to just order the ramen as it hits the spot on a blustery winter evening. But after talking to our server and listening to his recommendations, I changed my mind and ordered what he suggested. The classic and signature beef noodles with a cloudy white broth. It was simple in taste and full of ingredients - ramen style egg, wood ear, fried tofu and corn. The bowls are heated to 100 degrees so it's super hot to handle, hence it comes on top of a bowl holder. We joked that it looked like a pot planter or a pets water bowl but it works. Keeps the noodles and broth warm throughout my meal. He also suggested the vegetarian Duck Buns. Very good, smoky and tender but with the same texture of real protein, it was a nice change to actually eating meat. Enjoyed it very much.Hubby ordered the spicy ramen with extra noodles and it didn't disappoint. This place was a no frills, simple and clean, noodle spot. Totally a good value and while small, it's worth the wait if you can't get seated right away. Turnaround time is good."

We made a reservation and I would definitely recommend one because it was very busy and it's a pretty small venue. It's a narrow but long restaurant. We were a pretty big group of 6 people and despite our reservation we were initially seated at a 4 person table. It took a lot of convincing the hostess to move us to a larger table. We ultimately were moved after ordering 4 dozen oysters that didn't fit on our table. We picked bar belly for the $1 oyster happy hour and the oysters were amazing. Fresh and sizeable. We ordered 3 rounds of 4 dozen and it took about 20 minutes between each round to have the oysters shucked. The oysters were definitely the highlight of the night. The fries were also very good and had seafood seasoning that made them addictive and we ordered 3 rounds. The happy hour drink selection was basic and we opted to get their signature cocktails. Our group ended up trying at least one of each and they were all delicious. Burnt love, dead witch, invisible woman, knight rider were crowd favorites. I did order a mango #5 but something in it had a spoiled flavor I didn't like and the waiter was nice enough to switch it out for a different cocktail. We ordered the deviled eggs which were delicious and hit the spot when we started to get hungry. The charcuterie board was pretty standard and on the smaller side. Overall, you'll definitely see me back there for oysters."

I stopped by recently for dinner with my boyfriend and classic rolls are still priced at anywhere from $3.75 - $4.95! A steal, really, considering prices these days. Between my boyfriend and I, we ordered 6 rolls, pork gyoza, 2 miso soups, and 2 drinks. Our dinner came out to around $50 including tax and tip. The rolls here are decent and will probably satisfy any sushi cravings, but I wouldn't set expectations too high. Each roll has a really thin layer of rice, & the fillings are good considering the price. Miso soups were really tasty though & the pork gyoza sauce paired well with the dumplings. My only grievances with the dining experience would be that the menus need a bit of cleaning.. there's an unpleasant smell that comes off whenever the pages are flipped. The water also tasted off, so we opted for sodas instead."

Saw a bug on a bamboo piece and found more small bugs while inspecting the food... lost my appetite just thinking about having ingested some critters. We threw them in the garbage. The soybean pudding and beef dishes seem to be critter-free. Waste of food and money. Highly disappointing and disgusted..."

Still, it's a good entry point into Corner Bistro's simple, no-frills, ""old-fashioned"" approach, including its intentional (and annoying) resistance to things like credit card machines. It's 2022! (Yes, I know Mastercard/Visa/Amex/Discover are shameless, fee-seeking middlemen who pass that cost onto the consumer, but honestly, ""time is money,"" and having to get cash is annoying enough that I'm willing to pay $2 extra not to have to do it. Hopefully, when Solana Pay comes around, Corner Bistro rethinks this aversion to 1950s technology.)Anyway... the charm of Corner Bistro is that they barely do much to their burger, and it's one of the few things on the menu. You can order either a ""mini"" version or you can go for the full version, which is like a 1/3 pounder. *** I did the full version and added a portobello mushroom. I'd describe the burger as ""serviceably excellent."" Did I think it was transcendent? No. Was it like nothing I'd ever tasted (in a good way, not like poop)? No. Did I go, ""WHOAAAAAA"" after eating it? No. But it wasn't mediocre, either. The beef is well-sourced, juicy (get medium rare and stick to your guns if they try to push you up), and the focus is on the beef, not condiments or seasoning that I find often is an attempt to handwave you away from the quality of second-tier beef. I'm a big proponent of letting meat speak for itself, and I get suspicious when people start putting too much stuff on a burger or a steak. ""Some"" have criticized the patty for being a bit too lumpy -- less a well-shaped and crafted patty than a lump of ground beef passed off as a burger. I get this critique. It's hard to hold the burger, and it can fall apart (well, at least the full-size one). Ultimately, though, I didn't think it affected the flavor much, and as you know, I'm a substance not form guy.Seating is run-down gastropub-ish and also with outdoor option. The obvious comp here is JG Melon. I'd put them about even. If you go in and don't expect something paradigm busting, you'll have a great time.*** An earlier version of this review stated in error that the two people I went with -- my friend Johnny A. (commissioner of my fantasy basketball league) and Rinat B. (his partner) -- ordered a mini version of the burger. It also mocked Johnny A.'s ability to eat large quantities of meat and referenced his having to split a prime rib at Keens. In fact, he and Rinat B. both ordered the FULL burger. We at MC3 regret the error."

It has the kind of menu where you want to go back and try everything. Cocktails were delicious, although light, and variations on classics with Asian liquor. The owner, Kevin, was really friendly -- this is his second spot following the Jin in Hell's Kitchen, and named after his mom, which is sweet! We were the last group left before closing at 11 on Friday, and Kevin started personalizing the playlist to shepherd us out, but hopefully it turns into a more late night spot as the word spreads~~"

It's good if you're in the area but wouldn't make this a destination.Nakamura was on my list for a very very long time. Eventually the stars aligned and we were able to stop by for a late lunch.For starters ordered the gyoza and yuzu wonton soup. Gyoza was thin-skinned, crispy but a bit small. Yuzu wonton was enjoyable enough but again, $10 for a pretty small bowl with basically a dollop of chili oil on top.The ramen. I got the Torigara which is their signature ramen. At $18 with no egg or additional topping, this is an expensive bowl. The broth was clean, relatively light but it just seemed to miss that punch for me. The ingredients were fine but nothing stood out. Wife's Ton Toro was better but again, at $19 with no toppings - I think your money can go longer elsewhere.Would I try it again? Maybe, if I was in the area. However, Ishida is also down the block and till this day; I still think about that bowl."

This review is to comment on their indoor dining. We experienced not only Great food, but efficient service. Came here yesterday with family for late lunch (2pm) and we were seated quickly. A number of us ordered the beef tendon & brisket pho, a classic! I wish there was more protein in my bowl, specifically tendon & tripe, but or bowls came out piping hot. They also offered us a generous amount of pho accoutrement (bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime, jalapeños).Others in our party had the pork chops, which were marinated in a tasty sauce and grilled. Both went paired well with either rice or noodle soup. Side note they have a Clean spacious bathroom with a pull down changing table, but I wish it was more than just a 1- person WC for the whole restaurant. There was usually a wait. Will be back!"

I have had pho many times at different locations and it is one of my favorite foods but this spot ruined experience for me. There is no competing pho stores nearby like Flushing does so I came here.I ate in the restaurant the cold water they give tasted like sink toilet smell. Probably straight from kitchen faucet. The meat had a smell/aftertaste to it that was not good. Tasted cheap and soup base just tasted like salty ramen water. Usually the broth is the main reason I get pho with the hearty meat and veggies noodles. This was dissatisfaction.I ordered drinks because the water tasted terrible and soup too but the drinks were horrendous too. Service is okay but just the taste of food is a no for me....

So after my errands, I looked for a place nearby for a bite to eat. So I ended up at this cafe. My first thoughts were that it was cute and quaint (hence living up to its name). There was 1 person in the cafe enjoying a crepe while there were 2 people outside talking with what I assume was coffee. As you might tell by one of the photos, this is a cafe that does not allow computers in use. While I don't know if it is for outside too but it makes sense due to its small space to keep people coming for space. Because I had opted for an indoor visit, they had asked for my id and my vaccine card. I didn't know it was such a crepe heavy place until I arrived. I wasn't mad at it because I have not had a crepe in a while. I opted for sweet crepe through a banana Nutella crepe and added an orange juice mimosa. The mimosa wasn't too orange juice heavy but balanced enough for an afternoon treat. The crepe was sweet as promised with enough banana and Nutella to make it worth it. I had a nice time. The bathroom was perfectly clean. Though I can't come here for work (because laptop), I could come here for a quick bite by myself or with a friend or date. I do regret not getting a savory crepe so maybe I will next time."

Great way to get your pork shumai and shrimp hargow fix. Soups are legit as are the tofu skin dim sum and rice noodles with peanut sauce. Wish they had rice rolls like cilantro/scallion but it's all good. The duck in the duck bao was quite crispy - was expecting something more in the realm of Peking. But still enjoyable. The scallion pancakes are more on the ""fluffy"" side (in quotes bc they're still pretty flat) as opposed to more crispy or fried. Spare ribs are yummy. Love the sauce w the spring rolls... has a pepper bite to it that I crave. I order from here regularly when I'm craving dim sum but don't feel like making the trip to Nom Wah or an authentic push cart place."

The place was clean enough, had lots of napkins, condiments, and smelled yummy. Pros: - hot, fresh from the oven- thin, crisp crust - generous toppings- reasonably priced- fast service - tasted wonderful Cons:- carbs if you're not a big fan Why the 4?

You don't want to pay you cannot have anymore""RUDE!!!!The tomato for the caprese salad was not ripe... it was barely orange... This was the most horrific dinner experience I have EVER had and the food was barely eatable!

The service is outstanding, from the host to the bartenders to our server; I was blown away.The food was absolutely delicious. Of course I had to order the lasagna and I 10/10 recommend. An absolute must get here.We also ordered the chrysanthemum salad, which was splendid and full of flavor. We also got the stuffed garlic flatbread. It wasn't what I was expected but it was everything I needed. I had to stop eating it because I didn't want to get too full before the lasagna.Drinks were delicious.Atmosphere is intimate, sexy, clean, classic but still modern.I can rave about this experience and meal all day. They knocked it out of the park and now I had to wait out another opportunity to get in the door again.5/5"

We chose Le Rivage from word of mouth - apparently everyone in this part of NYC loves it!Our hostess and the manager greeted us in French and after a brief moment were able to find us a table even on a busy night. Thank goodness we came early. Everything from the table paper to  the bathroom was exceedingly clean and staff wore masks.The appetizers were definitely the high point of the meal. The escargot and Seafood crêpes were perfectly seasoned and creamy, better than any we have ever had.The main dishes were OK. We were excited about the award-winning french onion soup burger. In reality, the French onion flavor was mild; we would have expected a bit more seasoned onion as part of it. The mussels were also OK. The mussel broth had a very gardeny flavor, with notes of sweet pepper and tomato, not quite what we were expecting but interesting. We had better mussels at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant in Las Vegas.Dessert saved the show. The mousse and crème brûlée were fantastically creamy with just the right amount of sweetness.We loved the ambience, and the cost was on par with other good restaurants in the area. We would definitely go back!"

Artistic Pizza basically feeds NYU students, drunken bar goers, and hungry folks looking for a bite. went here two different times--got a plain slice the first time. the plain slice is okay/good, doesn't travel well, the sauce errs on the sweet side, it's covered in melty mozzarella, and the the crust is airy and soft (no crispness). the second time, i got a Margherita slice--sauce is fairly sweet, the blobs of mozzarella were soft and melty, the crust was airy and had a a little crispness to it. the slices are cut kinda small imo. didn't mind the smaller size on the plain slice bc it is a $2 + tip but the Margherita is like $4.50 + tip for a pretty small piece. maybe they make smaller pies but they don't seem to be the normal 18"" NYc pies. the other issue is i don't think the pizza oven gets hot enough bc even when the slice are reheated there is no crisp firmness to the crust. the staff is really nice and friendly. i wished the pizza was better bc their upbeat-ness warrants 4 stars. drops mic cuz not all pizza is created equali outzzz"

Outro has a very nice covered back patio with overhead heaters, but the heater was not warm at all. Luckily, the cafe is tucked between tall buildings, so it wasn't as cold and windy. It would be really nice to dine outdoor during spring, summer, and fall. There's a QR code on every table. Once seated, scan the QR code and it will bring you to their website to place your order. We ordered:Matcha rose latte + oat milk (additional 50 cents)Maple bacon & egg waffleEggs benedictThe presentation was so pretty. Picture perfect. Latte art was exceptionally beautiful and delicious. Food was so good! Waffle was perfectly crisp, maple bacon and egg were perfectly seasoned and cooked. Eggs benedict had a great balance of sweet and savory. Their unique twist on hollandaise sauce with beet juice gave it a slight sweet taste. Amazing addition to the eggs benedict!Customer service was ehhh =/ Server did not clean our table or checked up on us. He brought our food to us and that was it. Help yourself, kinda vibe. On the other note, the barista heard that we needed water for our dog and was kind enough to give us a bowl of water. I would definitely come back for brunch!"

The scent of spice and Cajun flavors that punched me squarely in the olfactory organ was reminiscent of a cartoon  character  floating on a wave of scent that stops them cold, beckoning  them towards it. This is exactly what you want to smell at a seafood establishment. I hope the food lives up to it. Because my bestie was late, I had time to sit and take in the atmosphere. 38 minutes as of this writing. The staff is so nice, relieving how awkward I feel sitting here in this giant ass booth alone. (Do I sound salty?)I digress. But because she is 41 minutes late, I had to ask for help with my temporary loaner phone (iPhone, ewl) and she brought me a charging device! I had no idea they offered that and would've never inquired. That was great to know since I've been entertaining myself with YT and online puzzles while simultaneously draining my battery . I'd never have known this had my friend not been 44 minutes late. They have a QR code for the menu but, because I was having technical difficulties they provided a paper menu. (I provided pics)The staff is so nice. I believe they think I got stood up on a tinder date (I see the ""oh you poor soul"" in their eyes) but it's just my pal that's now 48 minutes late. This was her idea. She picked it and invited me out. (Should I swipe left on this friendship?)The Boil has a nice laidback atmosphere and looks like a nice place to grab a few drinks. I'm not much of a boozehound but the bar looks substantial enough. (Then again, what do I know?)I've watched my share of couples and groups enter. Eat.And leave.And enter.Eat.Leave.Rinse & Repeat. No Fabric Softener.52 minutes in and I am sure I look hella sus (but cute) sitting here nursing ice water (which has long melted and is now room temperature slag)I busy myself vacillating between the  menu choices. Too much time + too many choices = meltdownMaybe I have undiagnosed adult ADD?56 minutes in and my acquaintance finally arrives . Suitcase in hand. (!).  (Am I being Punk'd? Where's Ashton Kutcher?)I had to guide her in from the train (but SHE picked this place!) Anyway by this time I'd talked myself out of a boil bag and chose a few items off the appetizer menu.NOTE: THIS IS A CASH ONLY BUSINESS!THIS IS CASH ONLY!CASH ONLY!OK? So don't come without cash, ok ?YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!I ordered the calamari, and soft shell crabs with seasoned fries. Then sent the squid back, because...reasons, and swapped it for a crab cake.Now, as a Northerner with deep fried southern roots, a frequent visitor to Maryland's Inner Harbor, and New Orleans, I KNOW seafood, and I LOVE seafood! And as a Southern raised Northerner, mama always said to focus of the positives.Soooo...the seasoned French fries were amazing. 10/10 would recommend the seasoned French fries. The seasoned French fries were great with the red sauce. I loved the seasoned French friesThe kinda familiar looking person sharing the booth with me; you remember, the late one; had the crab boil, which she liked.Ugh! Should've  had the daggone  boil!They add a 20% fee (tip) to your bill, so my poor beleaguered (albeit very nice and professional) server got less than if I were tipping freely. I'm a generous tipper (because although I, personally don't suck as a customer, most customers suck) but I get it as sucky people don't tip.The bill comes & the lady sitting with me puts down her CREDIT CARD! ‍*insert silent scream*It was quickly resolved thru the ATM conveniently located near the front door.All in all it was a nice day out and the stranger who shared my table was tolerable. But honestly save your coins and go elsewhere. And did I mention how much I loved the seasoned French fries?(Mama would be proud)"

I have tried all food, vegie and regular and they were great! quality and service was professional and wonderful. We had salad, drinks, pasta, duck, coffee and dessert. There were a construction and smell near by so they moved us to sit in different table to avoid the unpresented smell. The vibe is good. I have a mix feeling between tourist spot and local spot because this place is in a tourist area but for me as a resident I still go because I was shopping in the area and just want to find some nice place to eat."

For starters there is no parking lot, so drive and park at your own risk.  Although the risk is greatly worth the reward.   When I say the flavors are (food) orgasmic, please believe it.  Perhaps the experience was intensified by all of the anticipation, but if it was wrong then I never want to be right. Upon the first bite, I knew that I would have to make the trek to The Door in Queens more often.  If you've ever tried to get a Manhattan resident to another borough, you know how serious this is for me.I've had food dreams of returning to this place because it was all so delicious and authentic down to the allspice, bay leaf and scotch bonnet flavors dancing at the back of my throat.  Whether you have the oxtail, whole fish escovitsh, red bean soup, stewed peas, Mac n cheese, sweet corn bread, cabbage, plantains or you know anything else on the menu you will leave happy.   The portions were generous and my fingers were licked at the end.  Delivery is not an option but dine in, take out or call it in ahead of time so it's ready to enjoy in your car.

They also serve their burgers on a brioche with red onion and lettuce, tomato and cheese. Fries are top notch.Portion sizes are large and generous. Sodas are canned but served with a tall glass of ice in an ice cold can. Waters are in a glass bottle (which could be colder) and self poured after the first one.The places is really spacious considering the other restaurants in the area. The staff were even speaking French to each other which added to the ambiance.Decor here is well done. The dining rooms are connected but also separate from each other which help the place retain some intimacy. Good location for a date or even a business lunch.

It was a busy Sat. night, but they seated us reasonably quickly. Our server had a funny-sort of attitude when we first sat down -- perhaps she was having a tough night? (She warmed up to us by the end of the dinner, when she realized we spoke Spanish -- she was clearly not Italian.)The food was not memorable, but was decent. My fish entree was well-prepared. The wines were about the same -- good, but not memorable. We'd been spoiled by a truly bonafide Italian restaurant the night prior much further north up the West Side, so this was more touristy, perhaps, being close to Lincoln Center. We've lived in Italy, so are a different sort of clientele. I don't think I'd want to return or would recommend it. But it was an adequately pleasant Sat. night dinner. However, a caveat: of course, this is Manhattan!, But be aware that it was not inexpensive. Our two glasses of wine & two entrees, no appetizer or dessert, cost $100."

I ordered the French Onion Soup and a Deluxe Cheeseburger. Everything was delicious and the portions were big (look at all those fries!). The mens room had a lot of graffiti in it but I thought it was kind of cool in a ""Brooklyn/NY"" kind of way.

I personally think the food is tasty and I've never had an issue with the service even though it can get a tad slow at times. I've had one or two delivery issues before because they don't have drivers working 24/7, but aside from that, this is a local fave for a reason."

Unnecessary, rude, and straight up mean. Apparently a puppy - NOT MINE- (owner is an Asian female) accidentally peed on their already dirty a$$ stained black carpet in their entry way. SO IT WASNT EVEN ME - how f*cken racist!!I actually heard her profusely apologize, which I guess, that went nowhere. 1 - that's plain racist bc I'm not even the owner of the dog. 2- Two hands is a dog friendly place, accidents happen. 3 - hope he didn't spit on our food.Not sure how to respond to the response to my comment so doing it here.  Let me clarify, the racial comment I'm making is because 1 - the dog is not my dog (I am an Asian female which happened the owner of the dog also was)2 - I wasn't even there when it happened3 - why are you focusing on profanity vs the inappropriate actions of your chef. If you're genuine about discussing, why are you not DM'ing me. No one should be treated the way your chef treated me!I am not condoning the behavior of a dog urinating on the carpet. My response is to the actions of your chef that were out of line. He came out of the kitchen to scold me - I wasn't even there! Did he think I was the person with the dog when that happened? HE DIDNT EVEN GIVE ME A CHANCE TO SPEAK BEFORE HE SLAMMED THE KITCHEN DOOR  FACE AND WALKED AWAY. That is NO way to treat a customer. You're essentially saying your chef scolding and slamming the door at me is justified? This is absurd. Needless to say, I will not returning; seems you have turned this on me for complaining about the actions of your chef and focusing on the action of a dog"

A more discerning palate might call it dry but the texture of the filling was passable and flavorful enough for me. The egg noodles were pretty standard. Broth was on the thinner side and a little bland. Their kitchen is open aired and you can see that they have an extra large vat of broth in the main island. This vat isn't very accessible therefore I imagine that minimal seasoning occurs. The thinness also indicates that they don't simmer it over a long enough period of time to really develop the favors. Interestingly, they serve everything is disposable bowls and dishes so workers are constantly lugging out trash. The tea that they serve you was delightful and very much welcome on a cold early evening in mid April. Workers are quick to take your order and the food comes out fast. The Chow Fun looked like it had been pre-made as I did see workers pull many hot entrees out from a warmer. The beef chow fun was still delicious despite this. A solid spot for wontons and Cantonese food in general especially when you are in a hurry. They welcome take out orders as well for an easy grab-and-go experience."

The Catskills Rainbow Trout was the best main dish of the evening, but the off-menu spaghetti marinara made for a bambino took us all back to our favorite pasta place in Italy. Dessert is not to be missed. The Truffle Warm Dark Chocolate Lava Cake perfectly balanced sweet and bitter as arguably one of the best lava cakes out there, but it was the Meyer Lemon Tart that was metaphorically licked clean off the plate.  Several dishes were good, not great; My Grandmothers Ravioli was rather left to ""No, you have it. No, you."" Portions run smaller, so order more than usual. The bonus is you get to try more goodness.Our server was patient and made excellent suggestions. The cold evening outside sparkled with the twinkling fairy-lit trees and columns of incandescent office windows, which made for a wonderful contrast to the warm, cozy and elegant interior.

Been to most of the Vietnamese restaurants in the UES (from Pho Shop to Vietnaam and everywhere in between).  Took the family here on a Sunday afternoon. Small shop. Limited fast food style seating (ie sit wherever you want). Fast food style ordering but food is brought to your table.  Nice and clean decor. Owner is young, friendly and passionate about delivering a great experience. This is the 2nd shop with the 1st in the UWS.  We tried the Pho Dac Biet (with all meats), vermicelli with grilled pork, Chicken wings and summer roll. The owner was kind enough to give my kids a small serving of the fruit smoothie (always smart business to make the kids happy at immaterial incremental cost). Most important part of Pho is the broth and is very good here. Rich and flavorful. Bowl size is a little smaller than other areas in the UES and certainly much smaller than those in Chinatown.  Standard ingredients and sauces but noticeably fresher than other spots. The beef and meatballs (small, cute but flavorful) were good. The brisket is torn into strips which is atypical for Pho. Overall B on Pho. Kids graded it an A (have a suspicion the brilliant fruit smoothie had an influence in their grading). Chicken wings were an A. Definitely highlighted the visit. Not a traditional Vietnamese dish at all places but was very well fried and seasoned here. Summer rolls were B+. Very fresh and delicious but not tightly wrapped as you would normally expect so it falls after a bite hence a little messy. Vermicelli was delicious as well. A. Overall, fast, friendly, casual spot for good food. Will definitely visit again (kids have asked for it again )"

A very modern, clean, upscale vibe. Definitely very pricey and I'm not sure I'd go on my own (their online menu doesn't even have prices) but a good spot to go to when the company is paying. The fresh seafood selection is quite impressive and expertly/simply prepared as they let the quality of the fish speak for itself. The menu can be a bit overwhelming/confusing as there are so many options and many priced by the pound (and some must be shared) but I was happy to share the loup de mer with my colleague when that's what he wanted but they only had a fish for two. Sides need to be ordered individually (we had the broccoli and potoates) and while there is nothing special to the sides themselves, I find it necessary to have something on the side of a piece of fish. The Milos Special appetizer was impressive and tasty. A good spot to go to when you are looking to impress someone."

Burger came medium rare with a massive heap of fries, melted cheese and caramelized onion on top. Simple but cooked to perfection. It isn't the most innovative but definitely worth trying at least once.The restaurant is not big and gets quite crowded, so the atmosphere can be quite loud and rowdy especially on the weekends. Servers are friendly and fun. Prices are definitely on the higher end, cocktails are $21 and the burger will set you back around $30."

Beneath the circus tent-esque awning, a small shrubbery of houseplants occupies the window. Inside, harsh fluorescent lamps light the whitewashed walls, viridian shiplap trim, and dirty brick-red tiled floors. Plaques of Absolute Bagels' accolades and bagel-related photos line the walls. The queue loops to the far back of the space, where the many bagel varieties are separated into heaps. Directly to the right is a coolly-lit display of spreads and toppings, and the cafeteria-style red-and-yellow font menu is pressed above the counter. Teeny bopper pop mixes with the aroma of baked bread to fill the air.My partner and I arrived early on a weekend, and there was only a slow trickle of customers. We opted for an iced coffee and 2 toasted Everything Bagels -- one with Lox Spread, the other with Strawberry Cream Cheese (unfortunately, Absolute was out of the Blueberry). After paying (cash only!), we waited briefly before being handed a nondescript brown paper bag.The bagels were immediately notable for their large size, a blistered and crisp exterior with a generous coating of salt and other everything seasonings, and the chewy, flavorful interior. Our heavy dollop of lox spread, salty and packing a punch of flavor, was as enjoyable as full lox slices for just a fraction of the price. In comparison, the strawberry cream cheese was disappointing, sporting some strawberry slices but tasting wholly unremarkable, and further exacerbated by Absolute forgetting to toast this bagel. Finally, the iced coffee tasted somewhat watered down, and undissolved sugar crystals crunched throughout it.Despite the hiccups during this visit, I was impressed enough with my toasted bagel and lox spread that I had to visit again for round 2. This time, I arrived on a Friday morning to a more substantial line going out the door. I braved it and had a brown bag in-hand within 20 minutes, and, fortunately, the quality was just as exceptional as my original experience. $6 for a bagel with spread does not immediately scream bargain. But Absolute Bagels' churns out a killer bagel and a decadent lox cream cheese, rivaling $15 smoked salmon sandwiches I've had in the city. I would emphatically recommend that any bagel lover go out of their way specifically for this item."

After hearing Nowon was the new buzz in town, I had to go see for myself. I'm always... slightly disappointed... when it comes to American-fusion spots, but this was so far from disappointment.Legendary burger: 10000/10This was really, really, really good. Juicy drippy burger patty that tasted fresh, zingy flavorful kimchi mayo, tangy pickles and onion to cut through the grease, soft bun all tied with... AMERICAN CHEESE? Just... so awesome. I think one of the top burgers I've had.Chopped Cheese Rice Cakes: 1000/10Again... I don't really think fusion is swung well when it's American food + insert other cuisine. But this was insane.These rice cakes were so chewy and pillowy. Paired with the indulgence of beef and cheese and yummy tomato...  I would've never thought this would taste so good but here we are. I would go back for this. Spicy Coconut Shrimp: 9/10Filling for the size, these shrimp were sweet, tangy, nutty, and sour thanks to the lime and peanuts. I appreciated that they aren't breaded, so the dish was a little lighter than it could've been. The tomato and thai basil also paired nicely. Broccolini: 9/10OK this was like the only meh BUT it wasn't because of the sauce. The anchovy black sesame miso flavor KILLED it, but the broccolini could've been steamed or cooked a little longer as it was a little tough. That's ALL. It was still BOMB.The only drink we got was the ""THAT KUNG FU FROM JEJU - Plum Soju, Rum, Orange Blossom."" Our waitress described it as an old fashioned which I don't know if I agree but it was really great. Strong flavor but still light and not too boozy somehow. I'd get this again.Overall, you need to come here and you've definitely gotta get the burger and rice cakes!"

Coming from Seoul, I am not easily impressed by New York's cafes. They're often tiny, cluttered, prizing their espresso but neglecting their interior or comfort. But here, I felt just welcomed. They have an eclectic list of speciality drinks (I got the Robin) and the girl at the counter must have seen the blackness in my eyes, and she said ""we could add an espresso shot to that.""

(it was supposed to be ""on ice"" lol).the waiter scurried off and re-appeared with our bottle, more than a quarter full. this is the end of our meal now, yiiiikkkkkessssss. ""sorry,"" he said, and i realized this was maybe the third or fourth apology we'd received for something. the somm obviously never bothered to inform the server we had a bottle of wine, a communication lapse more akin to a roadside diner than a major food group restaurant.anyway. nice to be back, but i've grown too, it seems, and i'm not as easily impresed as i once was."

From what I remembered, the babkas were located on the shelves near the entrance. I looked there and all around, did not see any. So I went to ask the cashier. Her response ""It should be over there."" No type of specificity or pointing in a direction. Superrrr helpful I finally located them on the top shelf of a rack all laying flat with no signage. Hence, why I couldn't find them. Grabbed one and paid. Wasn't offered a bag, so I asked for one. The cashier, (middle aged woman with glasses) practically rolled her eyes, as if I'm asking for her kidney. I'm 100% on board with reducing bag usage and such. But if you're an establishment selling prepared foods, offer people bags! Or at least don't give customers an attitude for asking for one. That's fucking absurd. The service I received by aforementioned cashier definitely had some racist undertones, as she was all bubbly and friendly to the other non-Asian patrons. The babka wasn't worth the trash ass service. Will not return."

Other than that minor setback, the food were delicious; i got most of the recommendations from the Tiktok video, like the multi-colored soup dumplings and the pork and veggie dumpling in chili peanut sauce (it wasn't that spicy that's why i liked it). My husband got the Crispy stir-fried Seafood Noodle, and it was oh so good, it was not too salty and it had that tasty Umami flavor. Their Shanghai style Shu Mai was also good. They have this promotion that if our order went beyond $10, we get a free item, either soup dumplings or the Peking Duck buns; we got the Peking duck buns. Even if they were small and the slices were thin, the bun and the garnish and condiment made up for it, and it made us feel full right away lol they also offered a complimentary dessert, a sweet soup with glutinous rice balls and goji berries, it was not too sweet, which suited us fine.

It was some sort of fake chicken imitation which was good even-though i do not now what it was actually made of.

Except for the pasta, which soapy.This place has every possibility in the world. Re-train the chef. Work on quality control with the greens. Put herbs in something besides the signature cocktail.

I'm sorry to say that my order from here (under the 'King of Naan' name on Uber Eats) was amongst the most disappointing Indian food experiences, and delivery experiences, I have ever had. Having waited 20 minutes after the promised delivery time, I called the restaurant only to be told the owner had already left and be promptly hung up on before I could ask if he had indeed left to deliver my order, or if he had just walked out in despair at the quality of the food. Half an hour after being hung up on, my food presently arrived. The inclusion of 2 warm cans of soda did not redeem the food for being basically cold, and the lahori chana being more grease and water than chickpea and spice. The bread was also cold and so greasy it stained my fingers. Both had an unpleasantly strong and unexpected fishy aftertaste. At least I ordered when a deal was on, but no deal could ever tempt me back. There are far better options readily available in this neighbourhood (both sit-down and street food to go).

If your group is larger than 4 people, I'd suggest making reservations to make sure they have enough space.It's dimly lit in some parts of the restaurant so my pictures aren't that great. The lighting seems to be brighter in the back and the seats near the kitchen. I got a teishoku set that came with 2 chicken katsu and 2 fried oysters. It came with tartar sauce for dipping. I realized that I'm not as big of a fan of oysters as I had thought so I'd probably stick to their pork and chicken katsu if I ever revisit. They provided sesame seeds in a mortar which we're supposed to grind with a pestle then mix with the tonkotsu sauce. It's unique for sure, not sure how much of a difference it made for the sauce though. The chicken katsu were perfectly crispy. Sides of miso soup, rice and cabbage salad were pretty good too. Altogether it made for a very filling meal before the show.Bathrooms were small but clean and well stocked."

Often they look much better than they are but not this time, flavorful roasted mushrooms and small amounts of good cheese rather than gobs of gooey garbage cheese.  Excellent toppings and exceptional crust, thin, crispy and still a little chewy. Can't speak to the other slices, the Sicilian LOOKS a little goofy but the round pie crust is delightful. Bonus for actually having fountain soda which, as a large child like adult, I consider a necessary accompaniment to pizza."

Hand sanitizer at every table!Service was very good and they give you time and space you need. I was on time but others in my party were late and they were able to seat me right away. We ended up sitting for some time after eating and paying the bill and never felt pressure from the staff to leave. If you're a vegetarian, they have many options to choose from, ranging from vegetarian, avocado rolls, the mushroom streamed buns, vegetarian ramen and veggie fried rice. They also have ample vegetarian starters (caramelized Brussel sprouts) and appetizers. I had the veggie fried rice which was the perfect blend of rice and vegetables such as mushrooms, corn, spring onions etc. Plenty of drinks and beverages to select from as well. If I'm in the area again, I'll definitely be back here!"

Was it Thee best ramen of my life? No. But was it a solid choice? Yes! It was tasty. The staff were attentive. The restaurant was clean and the menu was simple. I liked the lunch special add-on feature so I had the gyoza and a cold beer with my meal! It was awesome!!!  If I were in Park Slope, I'd go back! The eggs were awesome and the yolk was so jammy and decadent! Omg! It was like thee best custardy hello consistency! In the best way! Y'all need to go! Aight. It's soup szn!"

We arrived around 1pm on a Saturday, and it was busy but we managed to get the last available table. Though the space is small, it's clean and pleasant to look at. Word of warning for the winter - if you sit at the two seats to the right of the door, it can get pretty cold since anytime the door is opened you'll be hit by the cold. We tried their chicken karaage, Kuro ramen and veggie miso ramen. For drinks we got white peach chu-hi (fruit sake) and Kyoto matcha IPA. Everything was well portioned and tasty. We loved the karaage, it was so juicy and flavored just right! The white peach sake was also amazing and tasted just like juice. The ramen was great too, though I wouldn't go out of my way to have it again. I added chili oil and corn to my Kuro ramen to give it a bit more pizazz. Come check this place out if you're in the area!"

It was covered with the ice cream theme: history, sprinkles, a slide, games that are found in arcades and lots of free unlimited ice cream to eat.The place is very clean and fun. There are stations to play, other stations to learn the history of making ice cream from Carvel to Ben&Jerry. I liked the display of scoops from the years past. Lots of interaction for all ages as a sprinkle pool, a huge slide to go down to the basement, and some games.All in All it's a nice way to spend some time doing something Sweet!Surprise: During your birthday month you get a free ticket!"

We made reservations for Saturday before Mother's Day not to deal with the crowds. I asked for 7 pm and was told they were all booked only time available was 6pm (no big deal) Restuarant is nice its clean looks like a cool place to eat. We place our appetizers' first than our main course there are 4 of us. Appetizers come out the special salads of grilled octopus and lobster looked and tasted very good, but the portions of seafood were very sparce. We are now waiting 25 minutes for our entrees ask the waiter he said there was a small problem with the kitchen. Finally, 15 mins later food comes out after waiting 40 mins and sitting there like idiots not knowing how much longer because no one came back to us. Pasta Primera vera was awful very salty and veggies were like mush. Send it back they bring us another dish now our food gets cold. Service is getting worse. now it's about 8pm and the restaurant has maybe 4 tables in use. We ordered desert Nutella pie special. The cook by the brick oven takes it out rings a bell and leaves it on the counter. Our waiter was no where to be found. We were sitting right in front of the oven all the cook had to do was walk 5 feet and serve us instead it sat there for 2 minutes that I timed. The waiter came back and said our 3 sodas where complementary for our wait and horrible  entree. No one works for free but the right thing to do was give us the entree at no charge not 3 sodas. I was lied to about reservation time the place was never fully booked , our wait was understandable if our meal and service would have been good which it was not. I left a smaller tip than what should have been but what I felt was appropriate for our experience. We leave and I cant find the valet person who we left our car with , but I see my car parked in front. I go back into the restaurant and ask one of the waiters if he has any idea about my car and he says no. After waiting about 5 minutes out side in the cold and rainy street. The valet guys shows up walks inside asked the same person I did about my keys and he points the valet to where my keys are. Poor service , poorly tasting food , being lied to , and now being spiteful about my keys because your tip was not as expected is a poor way to run a business. I will NEVER go back to Zio Toto nor would I EVER tell anyone to eat here. Much better places in Bay Ridge to eat that value there customers."

Went to counter, was told bathroom was being cleaned. Great, I love a clean bathroom. But after waiting a few more minutes, gently knocked. No response except ""Cleaning!"" Waited again, knocked gently again. ""Cleaning."" Door opens. ""May I please use the bathroom?"" ""Cleaning,"" is all the cleaner would say. A young woman from behind the counter appears at my side to tell me that the cleaner is only trying to do her job. As if expressing that you need the restroom and are told ""Cleaning!"" is keeping a person from doing their job. What is the priority here? The counter woman, after I silently turned in key, explained to me how there'd be a sign next time when the bathroom is cleaned that says ""Out of Order."" I proposed that it might be a nice move to halt cleaning to let a customer use the bathroom. At that point counter woman posed a sophomoric theoretical, ""Would you expect to go first if there were other people on line before you?"" When I answered tartly, I was asked, ""Are you okay?"" in the most concerned manner possible. I was schooled by a social justice warrior all because I asked politely if I might use the bathroom at an inopportune moment for the cleaner."

It can hold large parties as well, and they have boards that separate sections together. We ordered the:Fried Dumplings- These were realllyyy goood. It's kinda like a combination of boiled / fried. It's got a great crispy top, but it's not like hard or deep friend all around. It's still chewy and soft on the sides and the inside. Pork Tonkotsu Chasu Ramen- WOW. the pork literally MELTS in your mouth, the broth is creamy and rich, and the noodles are homemade. you can really tell that there's a lot of love in this bowl and it was giving ""lick the bowl clean!"" You could share this with someone as well, the portion size is huge. I'd recommend getting an appetizer if you have a bigger appetite! Side of Chicken Katsu- she was DELICIOUS. perfectly crispy and they give you a lot! it was great to dip in the ramen or eat by itself. Fried Red Bean Donuts- we were unsure if we should get dessert or not, but one of the lovely ladies (i feel like she's gotta be the owner or manager or something) -- she was so kind and told us that it was gonna be delicious... so we couldn't say no. it was great. traditional donut with lots of red bean. it also came with a sweet condensed milk dip.overall, i had a great time at this place. i know there are hundreds of ramen shops in the city, but please give this one a try! the service is lovely, food is delicious, and it's a hidden gem in the heart of a busy area. support your local businesses! x"

I'm staying at the hotel next door, the hotel room service has printed on their menu that we can order until 11 pm (attaching a picture for reference). I called the number to order at 10 pm, and I was told the kitchen was closed. Of course I was super confused, especially after a long day of traveling and being so tired and hungry. I expressed my confusion, letting them know it specifically says I can order until 11, and the person on the phone at first wasn't rude at all, but they went and got someone else on the phone. This second person was incredibly rude. He started off not too terribly, telling me they closed earlier because of the pandemic, which is understandable, but I did reply that it would be helpful if they updated the menus so that hotel guests aren't given misinformation (nevermind that everything else in NYC is back to normal hours so it's weird they're blaming this on the pandemic when every other restaurant seems to be back in full swing + they've had two years to update the info they give to hotel guests, but I digress). The man on the phone then said to me in an angry tone ""the kitchen is closed, what do you want me to do?!"" Well I'd like you to be polite and not speak to me in a condescending manner when I'm just confused and asking questions. I responded that it was inappropriate to yell at me rudely, and he literally hung up the phone. Unbelievably bad service.As for the food, I've eaten here in the past, the food is average and overpriced. The price would be fine if the food was excellent, but it's far from excellent. I actually was disappointed when I realized this was the restaurant providing the hotel room service, but I was so hungry after traveling I wanted the easiest thing. You might as well go to Olive Garden for how sub par their food was the last time I had it. Won't be returning, I don't need Olive Garden food at inflated prices with an incredibly rude man working there who treats people like garbage. Also the place always looks empty and sad, bad vibes."
